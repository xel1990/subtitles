1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,043
Hello, I really love travel.

2
00:00:02,043 --> 00:00:04,676
I'm 21-year-old, Shin Nayeon.

3
00:00:04,676 --> 00:00:08,609
I've been to places that are close to Korea like

4
00:00:08,609 --> 00:00:11,576
Taiwan, Hong Kong, China, Japan, Vietnam.

5
00:00:11,576 --> 00:00:13,743
I want to revisit

6
00:00:13,743 --> 00:00:15,009
Taiwan and Hong Kong,

7
00:00:15,009 --> 00:00:17,309
and I'm wondering where I should go.

8
00:00:17,309 --> 00:00:20,476
Since Hong Kong and Taiwan is already well known,

9
00:00:20,476 --> 00:00:25,076
please introduce me to unique places

10
00:00:25,076 --> 00:00:27,209
that people don't know very well.

11
00:00:27,609 --> 00:00:29,343
It's Hong Kong but it doesn't feel like Hong Kong.

12
00:00:30,009 --> 00:00:31,409
This isn't the Hong Kong I know.

13
00:00:32,109 --> 00:00:33,109
Let's go!

14
00:00:34,309 --> 00:00:35,609
Wow.

15
00:00:36,243 --> 00:00:37,609
I just got goose bumps.

16
00:00:39,809 --> 00:00:42,476
(Dynamic rides)

17
00:00:44,176 --> 00:00:46,609
We'll enjoy Lantau Island.

18
00:00:49,276 --> 00:00:52,043
It was so fun and fascinating.

19
00:00:52,043 --> 00:00:54,009
- Yong Kong. / - Byul Kong.

20
00:00:54,009 --> 00:00:55,943
Hong Kong, kong, kong.

21
00:00:55,943 --> 00:00:57,843
Kong, kong, kong!

22
00:01:00,176 --> 00:01:02,743
(Numerous great tips on trips)

23
00:01:02,743 --> 00:01:05,109
We give you great tips for trips on Saturday night.

24
00:01:05,109 --> 00:01:06,276
It's time for Battle Trip.

25
00:01:06,276 --> 00:01:09,443
Last time, we visited unique places in Hong Kong.

26
00:01:09,443 --> 00:01:10,843
- It was incredible. / - A new Hong Kong.

27
00:01:10,843 --> 00:01:14,509
They were really exciting trip planners.

28
00:01:14,509 --> 00:01:17,709
MAMAMOO's Moon Byul and Solar.

29
00:01:17,709 --> 00:01:20,143
They were the definition of fun.

30
00:01:20,143 --> 00:01:21,043
They were pretty.

31
00:01:21,043 --> 00:01:22,709
They're pretty but Solar's mouth was too big.

32
00:01:22,709 --> 00:01:23,743
I was shocked.

33
00:01:24,209 --> 00:01:27,476
The scary rides were even scarier because of her.

34
00:01:27,943 --> 00:01:30,009
Since you have kids,

35
00:01:30,009 --> 00:01:32,809
the theme park... You must've thought of it a lot.

36
00:01:32,809 --> 00:01:35,243
I went home and told my wife.

37
00:01:35,243 --> 00:01:38,443
- My wife agreed to make plans. / - To go for sure.

38
00:01:38,443 --> 00:01:40,843
My kids haven't heard of Disneyland.

39
00:01:40,843 --> 00:01:44,443
And the fact you can meet Iron Man...

40
00:01:44,443 --> 00:01:46,576
- That's the biggest merit. / - I got goose bumps.

41
00:01:46,943 --> 00:01:49,476
You can't see that anywhere else in the world.

42
00:01:49,476 --> 00:01:51,976
We'll be visiting when they're 6, turning 7.

43
00:01:51,976 --> 00:01:53,943
You'll be looking forward to that next year?

44
00:01:53,943 --> 00:01:54,876
Later on after they turn 6.

45
00:01:54,876 --> 00:01:57,009
We're heading to Taiwan today, right?

46
00:01:57,009 --> 00:01:59,543
Battle Trip has been to Taiwan a few times.

47
00:01:59,543 --> 00:02:03,109
- Shin Dong and Kim Sinyeong went. / - Many times.

48
00:02:03,109 --> 00:02:06,243
They flew the sky lanterns, ate corn at the hot spring.

49
00:02:06,243 --> 00:02:08,309
- They shampooed their hair. / - The shampoo.

50
00:02:08,309 --> 00:02:09,576
It was incredible.

51
00:02:09,576 --> 00:02:10,943
- BTOB went to Taiwan. / - BTOB.

52
00:02:10,943 --> 00:02:15,143
Eungwang with his lipstick on the ride.

53
00:02:15,143 --> 00:02:18,109
That made us laugh. It's unforgettable.

54
00:02:18,109 --> 00:02:20,009
That was the best.

55
00:02:20,009 --> 00:02:22,043
Again, we have two lovely planners.

56
00:02:22,043 --> 00:02:24,543
They went to Taiwan to show a side of it

57
00:02:24,543 --> 00:02:26,009
that's not very well known.

58
00:02:26,009 --> 00:02:27,743
Taiwan trip, intermediate level.

59
00:02:27,743 --> 00:02:29,676
Who went where?

60
00:02:29,676 --> 00:02:31,409
- I'm curious. / - I'm curious.

61
00:02:31,409 --> 00:02:32,676
Let's check it out.

62
00:02:32,676 --> 00:02:34,009
Taipei.

63
00:02:34,009 --> 00:02:34,909
Taipei.

64
00:02:34,909 --> 00:02:36,309
We arrived!

65
00:02:36,309 --> 00:02:37,576
That's incredible.

66
00:02:38,909 --> 00:02:46,076
(A place of magnificent natural surroundings)

67
00:02:47,209 --> 00:02:53,109
(A city of food)

68
00:02:59,209 --> 00:03:01,343
(No more Taipei)

69
00:03:02,076 --> 00:03:05,043
(Taiwan intermediate course, find a new place!)

70
00:03:07,109 --> 00:03:14,876
(Kaohsiung and Tainan)

71
00:03:16,109 --> 00:03:21,643
(Newer and more special)

72
00:03:21,643 --> 00:03:25,043
(A city beyond your imagination)

73
00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:35,843
(A new city of food)

74
00:03:43,109 --> 00:03:45,076
(1 week before the trip)

75
00:03:46,576 --> 00:03:49,209
(The trip planners meet the staff for the first time)

76
00:03:49,209 --> 00:03:51,909
(What are these two doing?)

77
00:03:53,376 --> 00:03:58,876
(Serious)

78
00:04:00,109 --> 00:04:03,643
(You should talk about the trip)

79
00:04:03,876 --> 00:04:08,476
We're complete newbies when it comes to traveling.

80
00:04:08,843 --> 00:04:11,376
Without perfect preparation,

81
00:04:11,376 --> 00:04:13,409
we won't be able to do anything there.

82
00:04:13,409 --> 00:04:15,276
So we prepared a few things.

83
00:04:15,276 --> 00:04:17,376
- Chorong and I... / - This is a map of Taiwan.

84
00:04:17,376 --> 00:04:19,509
We've divided it.

85
00:04:19,509 --> 00:04:21,943
The area I researched...

86
00:04:21,943 --> 00:04:25,709
Is here, Kaohsiung.

87
00:04:25,709 --> 00:04:30,609
Since we're an energetic girl group...

88
00:04:31,243 --> 00:04:33,409
We decided to be active during this trip.

89
00:04:33,409 --> 00:04:35,543
And so we're going to tour the city.

90
00:04:35,543 --> 00:04:39,309
There's a bike road that's 800km long.

91
00:04:39,309 --> 00:04:42,609
We'll start from Love River to Lotus Pond...

92
00:04:42,609 --> 00:04:44,476
- By bike. / - 800km?

93
00:04:44,476 --> 00:04:46,943
Once we arrive, our calves will pop.

94
00:04:46,943 --> 00:04:48,543
There's a theme park.

95
00:04:49,376 --> 00:04:52,243
We'll drive racing carts there.

96
00:04:52,243 --> 00:04:54,109
- But you don't have a license. / - Right.

97
00:04:54,109 --> 00:04:55,376
You don't need a license?

98
00:04:55,376 --> 00:04:56,343
Nope.

99
00:04:56,943 --> 00:04:58,843
They're all difficult activities.

100
00:04:58,843 --> 00:05:00,976
- Then... / - Aren't we eating anything?

101
00:05:00,976 --> 00:05:03,443
We'll visit a hot pot place called Tian Shui Yue.

102
00:05:04,043 --> 00:05:06,576
It's a really famous place.

103
00:05:06,576 --> 00:05:08,909
You should always eat first no matter what you do.

104
00:05:08,909 --> 00:05:11,376
It's a very well-planned course.

105
00:05:12,743 --> 00:05:15,843
I like to go for healing.

106
00:05:15,843 --> 00:05:18,243
I like to rest.

107
00:05:18,243 --> 00:05:22,543
I've planned our trip to the central region of Taiwan,

108
00:05:22,543 --> 00:05:24,243
called Tainan.

109
00:05:24,243 --> 00:05:26,076
There's a lot to do on this side.

110
00:05:26,076 --> 00:05:28,409
- Do you like hiking? / - Of course.

111
00:05:28,409 --> 00:05:30,176
- Is it okay? / - Yes...

112
00:05:31,476 --> 00:05:32,176
Your face says otherwise.

113
00:05:32,176 --> 00:05:35,343
I do enjoy hiking...

114
00:05:35,343 --> 00:05:37,609
But we won't be walking.

115
00:05:38,176 --> 00:05:41,076
There's one of the top 3 high mountain train in the world.

116
00:05:41,776 --> 00:05:44,743
So we'll take this train up that mountain.

117
00:05:44,743 --> 00:05:46,509
- Isn't it amazing? / - Yeah.

118
00:05:46,509 --> 00:05:48,976
Over here, we can see the sunrise and...

119
00:05:48,976 --> 00:05:50,176
Do you know sea clouds?

120
00:05:50,176 --> 00:05:51,609
- I do. / - What are they?

121
00:05:51,609 --> 00:05:54,643
Floating like the clouds...

122
00:05:54,643 --> 00:05:57,409
- It's a cloud. / - Right.

123
00:05:57,409 --> 00:06:01,343
And it's shaped like the ocean.

124
00:06:01,343 --> 00:06:03,576
We'll watch that and experience healing.

125
00:06:03,576 --> 00:06:05,309
I like oolong tea.

126
00:06:05,309 --> 00:06:07,409
I'm going to drink some proper oolong tea.

127
00:06:07,409 --> 00:06:10,809
Then we'll do mudpacks at the hot spring.

128
00:06:10,809 --> 00:06:14,343
All of mine are healing activities.

129
00:06:14,343 --> 00:06:16,209
Mostly to see and feel.

130
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:17,643
(Day 1, Hayoung's course in Kaohsiung)

131
00:06:17,643 --> 00:06:19,143
(Day 2, Chorong's course in Tainan, Chiayi)

132
00:06:19,143 --> 00:06:23,376
We'll use these to score the places

133
00:06:23,376 --> 00:06:25,176
since we're Apink.

134
00:06:25,176 --> 00:06:27,409
- Like triple A? / - Yes.

135
00:06:27,409 --> 00:06:29,776
To be honest, it might...

136
00:06:29,776 --> 00:06:33,009
It might not go as we planned.

137
00:06:33,009 --> 00:06:34,943
We'll be honest with our scores

138
00:06:34,943 --> 00:06:39,943
on this trip even though we planned it.

139
00:06:42,243 --> 00:06:44,309
One, since it's delicious.

140
00:06:44,576 --> 00:06:46,209
I think this one needs three "A"s.

141
00:06:47,009 --> 00:06:48,076
One for ambience.

142
00:06:49,976 --> 00:06:51,543
3!

143
00:06:51,543 --> 00:06:57,009
(Look forward Chorong and Hayoung's honest scores)

144
00:06:57,676 --> 00:07:03,676
(Oh Hayoung, Park Chorong)

145
00:07:03,676 --> 00:07:07,543
(Oh Amazing)

146
00:07:07,976 --> 00:07:13,243
(Korea to Kaohsiung)

147
00:07:19,409 --> 00:07:20,709
Where are we?

148
00:07:20,709 --> 00:07:23,976
- This is the theme park. / - Amusement park!

149
00:07:23,976 --> 00:07:28,576
Look. You have rides that are even famous in Korea.

150
00:07:28,576 --> 00:07:29,843
As soon as we arrive...

151
00:07:29,843 --> 00:07:32,043
The reason we're here

152
00:07:32,043 --> 00:07:35,809
is because it's only 5 minutes from the airport.

153
00:07:35,809 --> 00:07:38,309
It's only one station away.

154
00:07:38,309 --> 00:07:40,743
Let's enjoy the speed

155
00:07:40,743 --> 00:07:42,743
by driving go-karts.

156
00:07:42,743 --> 00:07:44,543
You don't have a license.

157
00:07:44,543 --> 00:07:47,609
You don't need a license for this.

158
00:07:48,809 --> 00:07:49,843
(Circuit Park)

159
00:07:49,843 --> 00:07:51,709
(A 10:1 replica of the Japanese F1 circuit)

160
00:07:51,709 --> 00:07:55,943
(600m long, top speed of 70km per hour)

161
00:07:56,809 --> 00:07:57,643
(Price of Circuit Park)

162
00:07:57,643 --> 00:07:58,943
(Single seater, 8 minutes, $25, lesson fee $4)

163
00:07:58,943 --> 00:08:00,509
(Double seater, 8 minutes, $30, lesson fee $4)

164
00:08:01,543 --> 00:08:02,276
(Ways to enjoy cart riding)

165
00:08:02,276 --> 00:08:03,576
(1, sign the agreement)

166
00:08:03,576 --> 00:08:06,576
(2, input personal info, you need your passport)

167
00:08:06,576 --> 00:08:10,476
(3, take a photo for membership)

168
00:08:11,576 --> 00:08:13,676
(Posing for the membership photo)

169
00:08:14,443 --> 00:08:16,343
Can I take my photo again?

170
00:08:16,876 --> 00:08:18,109
No.

171
00:08:18,676 --> 00:08:20,509
You have to use that next time as well.

172
00:08:20,509 --> 00:08:22,843
I should've taken a proper photo.

173
00:08:24,443 --> 00:08:26,276
Tie your hair before you put on helmets.

174
00:08:26,276 --> 00:08:27,243
We have to tie up our hair?

175
00:08:27,243 --> 00:08:28,743
(Hair over shoulder length must be tied up)

176
00:08:28,743 --> 00:08:30,576
I put my face in here.

177
00:08:32,209 --> 00:08:35,376
(Ta-da)

178
00:08:42,243 --> 00:08:43,309
Let's go.

179
00:08:46,109 --> 00:08:49,443
We've transformed to go-kart.

180
00:08:49,443 --> 00:08:51,709
We need to do that thing...

181
00:08:51,709 --> 00:08:53,443
- Bet. / - Oh, right.

182
00:08:53,443 --> 00:08:54,609
What should we bet?

183
00:08:54,609 --> 00:08:57,243
- Paying for lunch. / - Sure you can win?

184
00:08:57,243 --> 00:08:59,243
- No. / - I have no license.

185
00:08:59,776 --> 00:09:02,576
- People without licenses are the scariest. / - So true.

186
00:09:04,443 --> 00:09:05,709
I'm scared.

187
00:09:06,143 --> 00:09:07,376
This is to accelerate.

188
00:09:08,476 --> 00:09:09,343
Wow.

189
00:09:13,176 --> 00:09:15,576
- Hayoung, drive slowly. / - Okay.

190
00:09:16,609 --> 00:09:18,843
(Oh Amazing battle, racing for lunch)

191
00:09:19,443 --> 00:09:22,009
(8 minutes to go around the 600m circuit)

192
00:09:23,509 --> 00:09:24,743
(Chorong)

193
00:09:26,043 --> 00:09:28,076
(Hayoung)

194
00:09:39,176 --> 00:09:41,309
(Hayoung, drive slowly)

195
00:09:43,409 --> 00:09:46,243
(Hayoung speeds out)

196
00:09:49,443 --> 00:09:51,109
(Screaming)

197
00:09:51,609 --> 00:09:53,143
Hayoung, wait for me!

198
00:09:53,143 --> 00:09:54,776
I said to wait.

199
00:09:56,909 --> 00:10:00,143
(Takes a glance back and accelerates)

200
00:10:00,743 --> 00:10:03,676
Hayoung, wait for me!

201
00:10:05,143 --> 00:10:09,343
(Hayoung speeds on without fear)

202
00:10:12,476 --> 00:10:16,143
(Hayoung 56.415)

203
00:10:16,143 --> 00:10:18,576
(Chorong 54.074)

204
00:10:19,709 --> 00:10:22,109
(Chorong boosts forward and catches up)

205
00:10:24,143 --> 00:10:26,843
(The real race begins now)

206
00:10:30,076 --> 00:10:31,943
(She's almost caught up)

207
00:10:31,943 --> 00:10:35,009
(But Hayoung speeds on again)

208
00:10:35,809 --> 00:10:37,443
(Speedster Hayoung is difficult to catch)

209
00:10:38,043 --> 00:10:39,743
(Regretful, relaxed)

210
00:10:40,543 --> 00:10:42,443
(I will catch you, Hayoung)

211
00:10:42,909 --> 00:10:45,109
(Hayoung)

212
00:10:46,543 --> 00:10:48,443
(Hayoung records her fastest lap)

213
00:10:50,876 --> 00:10:52,409
(Driving so fast)

214
00:11:01,709 --> 00:11:05,143
(She doesn't panic and drives on)

215
00:11:12,943 --> 00:11:14,909
(Chorong starts her 3rd lap)

216
00:11:17,476 --> 00:11:18,843
(Chorong sees something)

217
00:11:24,609 --> 00:11:26,676
(Hayoung, what are you doing there?)

218
00:11:29,909 --> 00:11:33,143
(She crashed after going too fast)

219
00:11:36,009 --> 00:11:37,809
(Chorong, help)

220
00:11:40,676 --> 00:11:43,976
(Humiliated)

221
00:11:50,876 --> 00:11:56,543
(Hayoung didn't know what braking was)

222
00:12:02,209 --> 00:12:06,443
(Chorong's so happy to be in the lead)

223
00:12:08,109 --> 00:12:11,243
(Wow!)

224
00:12:12,476 --> 00:12:15,143
(Race over)

225
00:12:17,509 --> 00:12:20,043
(She gets back safe)

226
00:12:20,643 --> 00:12:23,076
I drove too recklessly.

227
00:12:23,076 --> 00:12:25,076
Safe driving is the best.

228
00:12:26,443 --> 00:12:29,743
I won!

229
00:12:29,743 --> 00:12:31,343
Free lunch for me.

230
00:12:31,343 --> 00:12:34,309
- 3 for me. / - Me too.

231
00:12:35,209 --> 00:12:37,876
Let's go eat. I'm so hungry.

232
00:12:39,009 --> 00:12:42,343
(A noodle shop in Kaohsiung)

233
00:12:44,576 --> 00:12:46,743
To tell you about how famous this place is...

234
00:12:46,743 --> 00:12:49,609
They're so successful that they opened a third store.

235
00:12:49,609 --> 00:12:56,209
Yoo Minsang's team mentioned 3 rules.

236
00:12:56,709 --> 00:12:58,443
What is Minsang's standard a good restaurant?

237
00:12:58,443 --> 00:12:59,209
What's your standard?

238
00:12:59,209 --> 00:13:01,143
- They have really good business. / - Good business.

239
00:13:01,143 --> 00:13:02,809
They expand their shop.

240
00:13:02,809 --> 00:13:04,443
- The owner is rich. / - Rich.

241
00:13:04,443 --> 00:13:05,676
Pays a lot of tax.

242
00:13:05,676 --> 00:13:07,043
- And it's old? / - Yes, it has to be old.

243
00:13:07,043 --> 00:13:08,676
- It's been around a long time? / - It has.

244
00:13:08,676 --> 00:13:10,876
This place has opened a third store

245
00:13:10,876 --> 00:13:12,243
so it passes the standard.

246
00:13:12,809 --> 00:13:15,043
What's this place famous for?

247
00:13:15,043 --> 00:13:16,943
It's famous for noodle soup.

248
00:13:18,343 --> 00:13:19,176
(Yang Chun noodles)

249
00:13:19,176 --> 00:13:20,876
(Made with noodles from Shanghai, China)

250
00:13:20,876 --> 00:13:23,276
(Topped with various garnishes)

251
00:13:24,076 --> 00:13:26,276
(Cheap yet delicious Yang Chun noodles and dry noodles)

252
00:13:26,576 --> 00:13:28,643
Thank you.

253
00:13:28,643 --> 00:13:31,109
Is this the dry noodles or the one with soup?

254
00:13:31,109 --> 00:13:32,409
It's the dry noodles.

255
00:13:35,943 --> 00:13:37,776
It smells like black bean instant noodles.

256
00:13:37,776 --> 00:13:38,743
Really?

257
00:13:38,743 --> 00:13:41,176
(A familiar smell from an unfamiliar dish)

258
00:13:42,209 --> 00:13:45,009
Going to famous restaurants on trip...

259
00:13:46,376 --> 00:13:48,509
- Chorong! / - Good? Black bean instant noodles?

260
00:13:48,509 --> 00:13:49,576
- Yeah! / - Right?

261
00:13:49,576 --> 00:13:51,176
It smelt like it.

262
00:13:52,043 --> 00:13:53,643
Try it.

263
00:13:55,909 --> 00:13:56,976
Right?

264
00:13:57,809 --> 00:13:58,809
Right?

265
00:13:59,743 --> 00:14:01,943
It's such a familiar taste.

266
00:14:03,243 --> 00:14:04,209
Cook...

267
00:14:05,176 --> 00:14:06,609
The thing you eat on Sundays.

268
00:14:07,176 --> 00:14:08,476
It's so good.

269
00:14:11,443 --> 00:14:13,176
Should we add some pepper?

270
00:14:15,209 --> 00:14:16,143
Chorong!

271
00:14:18,609 --> 00:14:21,343
- Is this pepper noodles? / - It's okay.

272
00:14:21,343 --> 00:14:23,376
You need pepper for these dishes.

273
00:14:24,709 --> 00:14:30,209
(She tastes the pepper noodles)

274
00:14:30,209 --> 00:14:31,109
It's salty, right?

275
00:14:32,476 --> 00:14:34,009
It tastes more like black bean instant noodles.

276
00:14:43,576 --> 00:14:46,043
- You prefer this one. / - It's good.

277
00:14:47,509 --> 00:14:48,343
Thank you.

278
00:14:50,009 --> 00:14:51,076
This is the noodle soup.

279
00:14:53,576 --> 00:14:55,109
It doesn't have a strong smell.

280
00:15:00,009 --> 00:15:01,576
Radish soup!

281
00:15:02,043 --> 00:15:03,376
It tastes like radish soup.

282
00:15:03,976 --> 00:15:05,643
- It's good. / - This one's good.

283
00:15:06,009 --> 00:15:07,443
They all taste good.

284
00:15:12,343 --> 00:15:14,443
It kind of tastes like rice noodles.

285
00:15:14,876 --> 00:15:17,609
The noodles aren't too strong.

286
00:15:17,609 --> 00:15:18,943
I like it. It's to my liking.

287
00:15:20,943 --> 00:15:22,143
Hayoung, you're eating so well.

288
00:15:23,243 --> 00:15:27,743
(She's not very good with spices)

289
00:15:28,776 --> 00:15:30,976
I was worried whether I'd like it or not.

290
00:15:30,976 --> 00:15:34,043
I'm an extremely picky eater.

291
00:15:34,043 --> 00:15:35,643
But I'm eating well today.

292
00:15:35,643 --> 00:15:37,443
If Hayoung can eat it...

293
00:15:37,443 --> 00:15:41,143
Anyone who's bad with foreign food will be fine.

294
00:15:41,143 --> 00:15:42,409
They can all eat it.

295
00:15:42,843 --> 00:15:44,043
You chose a good place, Hayoung.

296
00:15:44,709 --> 00:15:46,043
I'm satisfied.

297
00:15:46,043 --> 00:15:47,376
We ate all this.

298
00:15:47,376 --> 00:15:49,809
- And it's not $10. / - Really?

299
00:15:50,043 --> 00:15:53,243
(This didn't even cost $10?)

300
00:15:53,509 --> 00:15:55,776
This and this...

301
00:15:55,776 --> 00:15:57,309
- The price... / - How much is it?

302
00:15:57,309 --> 00:15:59,943
Around $15.

303
00:16:01,109 --> 00:16:02,043
$15.00

304
00:16:03,676 --> 00:16:04,876
For these two?

305
00:16:04,876 --> 00:16:06,309
It's $3 total.

306
00:16:06,943 --> 00:16:09,809
Even spicy rice cakes cost $2.

307
00:16:09,809 --> 00:16:11,476
All these sides are $1.

308
00:16:11,976 --> 00:16:13,843
It doesn't even feel like I'm spending money.

309
00:16:15,143 --> 00:16:17,443
We give it 3 "A"s.

310
00:16:19,809 --> 00:16:22,609
Next course. It was so good.

311
00:16:23,743 --> 00:16:25,209

318

- To tell you about this place... / - So nice.

319
00:16:41,976 --> 00:16:44,343
It's the river in the center of Kaohsiung.

320
00:16:45,543 --> 00:16:48,076
From my research...

321
00:16:48,076 --> 00:16:52,043
Kaohsiung is a top 5 Asian city as rated by CNN.

322
00:16:52,743 --> 00:16:56,209
There's a bike road that's 800km long.

323
00:16:56,209 --> 00:16:57,976
I've wanted to ride bikes these days.

324
00:16:57,976 --> 00:17:01,143
I know. And we're young.

325
00:17:01,143 --> 00:17:02,709
Young?

326
00:17:02,709 --> 00:17:04,009
We're youthful.

327
00:17:04,009 --> 00:17:08,109
Compared to the other team....

328
00:17:08,109 --> 00:17:10,643
We're probably younger thanks to me.

329
00:17:10,643 --> 00:17:12,243
I'll cover for your age.

330
00:17:12,976 --> 00:17:14,076
So...

331
00:17:16,309 --> 00:17:18,976

It's free for 30 minutes.

337
00:17:30,643 --> 00:17:33,976
The place we're headed to is called Pier-2 Art Center.

338
00:17:33,976 --> 00:17:35,709
It takes about 10 minutes to get there.

339
00:17:35,709 --> 00:17:38,376
And if we ride these bikes, it's free.

340
00:17:38,376 --> 00:17:42,009
The great thing is, if you use a credit card,

341
00:17:42,009 --> 00:17:43,376
it's easy.

(They're racing from the start)

349
00:18:09,243 --> 00:18:10,409
This is fun.

350
00:18:14,476 --> 00:18:16,043
Should we play some music?

351
00:18:21,176 --> 00:18:24,076
(Hayoung is currently singing "Rainism")

352
00:18:29,143 --> 00:18:30,909
Hayoung is strange.

353
00:18:31,876 --> 00:18:33,676
She's strange.

354
00:18:36,176 --> 00:18:39,076
- Wow, what's this? / - It's so pretty here.

355

00:18:56,376 --> 00:18:58,876
(It was recreated into an art space)

364
00:19:02,343 --> 00:19:03,543
We're here.

365
00:19:04,376 --> 00:19:05,743
It was perfect

366
00:19:08,576 --> 00:19:09,343
Okay.

367
00:19:09,343 --> 00:19:10,276
- Done? / - Yeah.

368
00:19:11,776 --> 00:19:14,643
(Do you want to leave for somewhere?)

369
00:19:17,343 --> 00:19:19,643
(It's time to leave)

370
00:19:21,576 --> 00:19:27,509
(A train ride of memories)

371
00:19:29,476 --> 00:19:33,743
When you watch things like "Spirited Away,"

372
00:19:33,743 --> 00:19:35,409
they ride the train.

373
00:19:35,409 --> 00:19:37,076
It feels like that.

374
00:19:37,076 --> 00:19:38,843
(Time to get on the train)

375
00:19:39,809 --> 00:19:41,576
(Ready to leave)

376
00:19:41,976 --> 00:19:43,176
It's us.

377
00:19:46,076 --> 00:19:47,376
Thank you.

378
00:19:48,176 --> 00:19:48,876
Here goes.

379
00:19:49,909 --> 00:19:51,276
Let's go.

380
00:19:51,809 --> 00:19:53,809
Hello, baby.

381
00:19:54,643 --> 00:19:56,076
(Heading out)

382
00:19:57,309 --> 00:19:58,943
(It's a kid's train)

383
00:19:59,543 --> 00:20:01,543
Hello, baby.

384
00:20:01,543 --> 00:20:03,009
So cute.

385
00:20:03,943 --> 00:20:06,143
(Pier-2 Art Center mini train, $9)

386
00:20:07,143 --> 00:20:09,009
This is a perfect fit for me.

387
00:20:10,809 --> 00:20:13,276
It's comfortable.

388
00:20:13,876 --> 00:20:16,776
It's safe even if you don't hold the handles.

389
00:20:19,876 --> 00:20:22,443
- It's like we're entering an unknown world. / - Yeah.

390
00:20:23,743 --> 00:20:25,876
The kids would love this.

391
00:20:26,409 --> 00:20:28,609
Look, dinosaur. Dinosaur.

392
00:20:31,243 --> 00:20:34,776
But the people walking are faster.

393
00:20:35,309 --> 00:20:37,643
It's really slow but isn't it nice?

394
00:20:38,676 --> 00:20:40,076
This is very pleasant.

395
00:20:43,743 --> 00:20:45,243
It's getting faster.

396
00:20:45,976 --> 00:20:47,209
This is very pleasant.

397
00:20:47,209 --> 00:20:50,643
(It's not really this slow, is it?)

398
00:20:50,643 --> 00:20:52,109
Isn't this too cute?

399
00:20:54,143 --> 00:20:55,843
(Pier-2 Art Center District B)

400
00:20:55,843 --> 00:21:02,109
(Renovated warehouses have become galleries)

401
00:21:02,109 --> 00:21:06,243
(They're free of charge)

402
00:21:07,043 --> 00:21:10,443
- We must be here. / - No, I want to ride more.

403
00:21:11,409 --> 00:21:13,609
It's called the Pier-2 Art Center.

404
00:21:13,609 --> 00:21:17,176
You can see modern art in Kaohsiung.

405
00:21:17,176 --> 00:21:19,676
We must take photos here

406
00:21:19,676 --> 00:21:21,009
and upload them on social media.

407
00:21:21,976 --> 00:21:24,643
We must.

408
00:21:25,109 --> 00:21:26,076
Okay.

409
00:21:27,743 --> 00:21:31,343
(District C is good for social media photos)

410
00:21:33,476 --> 00:21:35,776
(Trying to get a photo of their lives here)

411
00:21:37,609 --> 00:21:39,243
It's so pretty.

412
00:21:39,243 --> 00:21:41,143
That kid is peeing.

413
00:21:41,143 --> 00:21:43,609
How about a photo of you peeping?

414
00:21:43,609 --> 00:21:45,876
That's too crude.

415
00:21:45,876 --> 00:21:47,709
Why would we peep?

416
00:21:47,709 --> 00:21:49,843
I'm sorry. He's only a kid.

417
00:21:51,509 --> 00:21:55,209
- That's a bit... / - We can't show ourselves like this.

418
00:21:55,743 --> 00:21:57,076
This one.

419
00:21:58,243 --> 00:22:00,076
Try it.

420
00:22:00,076 --> 00:22:02,876
Take the photo when I'm in the air.

421
00:22:02,876 --> 00:22:05,643
Okay. 1, 2, 3.

422
00:22:07,609 --> 00:22:08,443
Did you get it?

423
00:22:08,443 --> 00:22:11,276
I feel like Gulliver.

424
00:22:12,843 --> 00:22:15,376
- Doesn't this look cool too? / - Let's see.

425
00:22:15,376 --> 00:22:16,709
This place is cool.

426
00:22:17,476 --> 00:22:19,809
(Extra close-up shots are okay)

427
00:22:19,809 --> 00:22:20,976
That looks so good.

428
00:22:22,476 --> 00:22:23,276
Check this out.

429
00:22:24,743 --> 00:22:27,043
You need something like this to get loads of likes.

430

(It's not over yet)

431
00:22:30,209 --> 00:22:32,009
- You can do it, right? / - Of course.

432
00:22:32,009 --> 00:22:32,743
Go pose.

433
00:22:34,609 --> 00:22:35,343
Okay.

434
00:22:35,976 --> 00:22:37,243
Nice.

435
00:22:39,009 --> 00:22:40,143
That was good.

436
00:22:40,143 --> 00:22:41,143
I got it.

437
00:22:42,843 --> 00:22:43,643
Check it out.

438
00:22:45,209 --> 00:22:46,043
Looks good, right?

439
00:22:47,209 --> 00:22:48,776
Okay, your turn.

440
00:22:48,776 --> 00:22:49,509
Oh, my.

441
00:22:51,243 --> 00:22:52,809
You look like a cool girl with heartache.

442
00:22:54,476 --> 00:22:55,309
Okay, okay.

443
00:22:55,776 --> 00:22:57,009
Okay!

444
00:22:57,009 --> 00:22:58,243
That's the one.

445
00:22:59,343 --> 00:23:00,243
Good, good.

446
00:23:00,243 --> 00:23:01,209
Girl crush.

447
00:23:03,009 --> 00:23:03,976
Check this out.

448
00:23:05,809 --> 00:23:06,743
This one's nice too.

449

(They found their once in a lifetime photos)

450
00:23:23,876 --> 00:23:24,843
My goodness.

451
00:23:28,043 --> 00:23:29,476
(It was the balloon)

452
00:23:30,809 --> 00:23:32,676
(Best photo no. 3)

453
00:23:32,676 --> 00:23:35,409
(Best photo no. 2)

454
00:23:35,409 --> 00:23:37,409
(Best photo no. 1)

455
00:23:37,409 --> 00:23:40,043
We've used up a lot of calories here.

456
00:23:40,043 --> 00:23:40,909
Yeah, I'm hungry.

457
00:23:40,909 --> 00:23:43,776
We spewed out our passion for these photos.

458
00:23:43,776 --> 00:23:47,009
Let's go to have good food.

459
00:23:47,009 --> 00:23:48,076
I'm hungry.

460
00:23:48,076 --> 00:23:49,576
I digest so fast.

461
00:23:50,843 --> 00:23:54,576
(Their very active day passes)

462
00:23:57,143 --> 00:23:58,509
It's night time.

463
00:23:58,509 --> 00:24:00,143
To tell you about this place...

464
00:24:00,143 --> 00:24:03,276
It's where we can eat till we pop.

465
00:24:03,276 --> 00:24:06,209
It's a proper hot pot place.

466
00:24:06,209 --> 00:24:07,243
Oh, hot pot!

467
00:24:07,709 --> 00:24:09,309
It's been so long.

468
00:24:09,309 --> 00:24:11,709
We rode so many things today

469
00:24:11,709 --> 00:24:15,476
so we'll have hot pot to heal up.

470
00:24:15,476 --> 00:24:16,343
Bye.

471
00:24:16,776 --> 00:24:18,609
- The restaurant is huge. / - I know.

472
00:24:19,343 --> 00:24:20,576
It's really classy.

473
00:24:21,143 --> 00:24:23,209
The door itself is already so grand. Open...

474
00:24:23,209 --> 00:24:24,209
Sesame.

475
00:24:25,443 --> 00:24:26,076
Amazing.

476
00:24:27,176 --> 00:24:29,543
(Surprise)

477
00:24:29,543 --> 00:24:31,109
- Amazing. / - What is this place?

478
00:24:32,343 --> 00:24:33,643
It's amazing.

479
00:24:36,743 --> 00:24:37,343
(Tian Shui Yue Hot Pot)

480
00:24:37,343 --> 00:24:38,243
(A trending place in Kaohsiung for its ambience)

481
00:24:38,243 --> 00:24:40,076
(Popular among the youth for affordable prices)

482
00:24:40,076 --> 00:24:42,443
It looks really fancy here

483
00:24:42,443 --> 00:24:47,009
but it's all between $11 and $15.

484
00:24:47,009 --> 00:24:49,509
And you don't eat as a table.

485
00:24:49,509 --> 00:24:51,943
You get your own bowl.

486
00:24:51,943 --> 00:24:53,643
That's so good.

487
00:24:53,643 --> 00:24:56,643
So you can eat what you want.

488
00:24:56,643 --> 00:24:59,476
The specialty here is sukiyaki.

489
00:24:59,476 --> 00:25:01,076
It's really famous.

490
00:25:01,076 --> 00:25:04,443
So we'll get a bowl of broth each.

491
00:25:04,443 --> 00:25:07,943
And order sukiyaki. What do you think?

492
00:25:07,943 --> 00:25:09,209
Sounds good.

493
00:25:09,209 --> 00:25:11,709
We could eat till we're full and it won't cost much.

494
00:25:12,209 --> 00:25:12,976
Oh!

495
00:25:17,509 --> 00:25:21,076
(Surprised)

496
00:25:23,309 --> 00:25:25,976
- It's a big cotton candy. / - It's coming.

497
00:25:27,776 --> 00:25:28,576
Amazing.

498
00:25:29,109 --> 00:25:30,609
Check this out.

499
00:25:30,609 --> 00:25:33,309
It's a huge cotton candy.

500
00:25:35,909 --> 00:25:37,743
Telling us to film it.

501
00:25:37,743 --> 00:25:40,676
(Something you can only see here)

502
00:25:43,243 --> 00:25:47,743
(The cotton candy disappears before your eyes)

503
00:25:48,943 --> 00:25:50,576
It's a performance.

504
00:25:55,543 --> 00:25:57,276
Oh, my God.

505
00:25:57,709 --> 00:25:59,009
It's going crazy.

506
00:26:00,243 --> 00:26:01,309
Oh, my God.

507
00:26:02,943 --> 00:26:04,776
This must be the real deal.

508
00:26:04,776 --> 00:26:06,943
There's so much to eat.

509
00:26:07,343 --> 00:26:09,643
- This is the standard meal? /  - I think so.

510
00:26:12,343 --> 00:26:14,043
Wow, it looks so good.

511
00:26:17,743 --> 00:26:19,743
I think I have to add this now.

512
00:26:20,176 --> 00:26:22,043
Do I just put it all in?

513
00:26:22,643 --> 00:26:24,543
I'll add the seafood later.

514
00:26:25,409 --> 00:26:26,776
Did I add too much?

515
00:26:28,376 --> 00:26:32,076
(Looks delicious)

516
00:26:33,876 --> 00:26:36,843
- Hayoung adds the meat first. / -  Yes.

517
00:26:38,043 --> 00:26:40,009
It's so big. It's the size of my face.

518
00:26:41,243 --> 00:26:42,276
It is!

519
00:26:47,309 --> 00:26:49,409
I can smell the hot pot.

520
00:26:50,376 --> 00:26:52,009
I want to try the meat first.

521
00:26:54,843 --> 00:26:58,376
(It's finally time to eat)

522
00:26:59,543 --> 00:27:00,709
I'd better try some.

523
00:27:00,709 --> 00:27:03,309
In this Taiwanese sauce.

524
00:27:10,043 --> 00:27:11,809
Is it incredible?

525
00:27:13,476 --> 00:27:14,876
You won't be able to eat this.

526
00:27:15,843 --> 00:27:18,109
It smells a bit like shrimp.

527
00:27:18,109 --> 00:27:20,209
- It's good. / - Should I try some too?

528
00:27:21,209 --> 00:27:25,009
(She eats the broth with no sauce)

529
00:27:25,676 --> 00:27:27,376
It's so good.

530
00:27:28,243 --> 00:27:29,376
I'm happy.

531
00:27:30,709 --> 00:27:32,409
Hayoung, I want to try yours.

532
00:27:37,776 --> 00:27:40,643
If you're a picky eater, order the original.

533
00:27:40,643 --> 00:27:42,409
Everything is best in the original.

534
00:27:43,176 --> 00:27:47,109
But mine has a strong flavor.

535
00:27:47,109 --> 00:27:49,576
It's better without the sauce.

536
00:27:49,576 --> 00:27:51,743
Just eat it as is.

537
00:27:55,943 --> 00:27:56,943
Let's eat.

538
00:27:58,009 --> 00:27:59,576
This is Taiwan.

539
00:28:00,143 --> 00:28:02,609
(Gorging on food)

540
00:28:05,976 --> 00:28:08,309
(The cotton candy sukiyaki)

541
00:28:11,076 --> 00:28:12,176
(They both go for it)

542
00:28:12,176 --> 00:28:13,376
We have to stand to eat this.

543
00:28:13,376 --> 00:28:15,076
There's meat in here.

544
00:28:15,609 --> 00:28:16,576
(Sukiyaki)

545
00:28:16,576 --> 00:28:18,176
(A hot pot dish made with soy sauce and sugar)

546
00:28:18,176 --> 00:28:19,576
The sukiyaki is so good.

547
00:28:21,743 --> 00:28:24,043
Sukiyaki goes with egg.

548
00:28:24,409 --> 00:28:27,109
(She knows how to eat it)

549
00:28:27,676 --> 00:28:29,276
This is torture, right?

550
00:28:35,643 --> 00:28:37,276
(Thumbs up)

551
00:28:37,276 --> 00:28:39,476
I thought it'd be too sweet

552
00:28:39,476 --> 00:28:41,209
because of the cotton candy.

553
00:28:41,209 --> 00:28:42,009
But it's not sweet.

554
00:28:42,809 --> 00:28:45,443
I think the sukiyaki is better.

555
00:28:49,509 --> 00:28:51,143
The sukiyaki is so good.

556
00:28:52,476 --> 00:28:56,343
(She can't stop eating)

557
00:28:57,809 --> 00:29:00,043
- It's good. / - It's so good.

558
00:29:01,676 --> 00:29:02,809
It's really good, right?

559
00:29:03,743 --> 00:29:05,876
It's not even that sweet.

560
00:29:05,876 --> 00:29:11,209
(One meat after another)

561
00:29:11,209 --> 00:29:13,909
It's like we're stealing our members' food.

562
00:29:17,009 --> 00:29:18,776
(An extra serving of meat)

563
00:29:19,576 --> 00:29:21,609
The food's finally here.

564
00:29:21,609 --> 00:29:23,843
Wow, it just came out?

565
00:29:23,843 --> 00:29:27,543
- Is this that one? / - This must be the meat.

566
00:29:28,709 --> 00:29:29,943
Let's taste it.

567
00:29:37,209 --> 00:29:44,009
(If it's too hot, cheers)

568
00:29:46,209 --> 00:29:50,943
(Bottoms up)

569
00:29:52,609 --> 00:29:56,643
(Third phase of their dinner)

570
00:30:00,743 --> 00:30:02,876
I'm starting to get full.

571
00:30:02,876 --> 00:30:05,076
What's our overall evaluation?

572
00:30:05,076 --> 00:30:06,543
1 point for ambience.

573
00:30:06,543 --> 00:30:08,909
- What about price? / - Honestly, the price.

574
00:30:08,909 --> 00:30:10,509
All this...

575
00:30:10,509 --> 00:30:11,609
It's only because we ate a lot

576
00:30:11,609 --> 00:30:15,243
but all this was a little over $50.

577
00:30:15,243 --> 00:30:17,209
1 for price.

578
00:30:18,176 --> 00:30:19,776
Now for taste.

579
00:30:21,576 --> 00:30:23,876
The youngest prepared this with much thought.

580
00:30:23,876 --> 00:30:26,076
So it deserves another "A," right?

581
00:30:27,576 --> 00:30:29,943
Now it's my turn.

582
00:30:29,943 --> 00:30:32,176
Into the majesty of nature...

583
00:30:32,176 --> 00:30:34,276
- For healing. / - Healing.

584
00:30:34,276 --> 00:30:36,409
We have to cover some distance.

585
00:30:36,409 --> 00:30:38,343
We're supposed to leave now.

586
00:30:39,776 --> 00:30:41,876
- It's hardcore, right? / - We have to sleep.

587
00:30:42,743 --> 00:30:45,709
What kind of healing is this?

588
00:30:46,376 --> 00:30:48,776
Wait. This is so tiring.

589
00:30:48,776 --> 00:30:50,009
My feet hurt too much.

590
00:30:50,909 --> 00:30:52,143
Hayoung's dying.

591
00:30:52,843 --> 00:30:55,109
Wow.

592
00:30:55,109 --> 00:30:56,209
Incredible.

593
00:31:00,143 --> 00:31:05,209
(Oh Amazing Tour is full of surprises, look forward to it)

594
00:31:08,443 --> 00:31:11,109
Where are we?

595
00:31:11,109 --> 00:31:13,443
Zuoying HSR Station.

596
00:31:13,443 --> 00:31:15,076
We have to head off on a long journey

597
00:31:15,509 --> 00:31:17,609
Do you know how to purchase the tickets?

598
00:31:17,609 --> 00:31:18,509
Of course.

599
00:31:18,509 --> 00:31:22,209
We're at Zuoying Station.

600
00:31:22,209 --> 00:31:25,276
And we're heading to Chiayi Station.

601
00:31:26,143 --> 00:31:27,643
Chiayi Station.

602
00:31:27,643 --> 00:31:28,443
Okay.

603
00:31:28,443 --> 00:31:34,576
(Heading to the Alishan Range)

604
00:31:35,843 --> 00:31:38,409
Finally, we get to see the sunrise.

605
00:31:38,409 --> 00:31:39,743
(Zuoying Station to Chiayi Station, 30 minutes)

606
00:31:39,743 --> 00:31:43,243
(Chiayi Station to Alishan Range, 3 hours by bus)

607
00:31:43,743 --> 00:31:48,043
I feel like it's not a holiday if it's too hard.

608
00:31:48,043 --> 00:31:51,343
So, I go for healing activities

609
00:31:51,343 --> 00:31:53,609
since I like to rest.

610
00:31:53,609 --> 00:31:55,609
(Chorong's course in Tainan, Chiayi County)

611
00:31:55,609 --> 00:31:58,476
(Watching the sunrise on Alishan Range)

612
00:31:59,476 --> 00:32:01,343
(So dark)

613
00:32:01,343 --> 00:32:03,643
What's going on here?

614
00:32:03,643 --> 00:32:04,643
Chorong?

615
00:32:05,109 --> 00:32:06,376
What time is it?

616
00:32:06,376 --> 00:32:09,643
It's a bit past 4 a.m.

617
00:32:09,643 --> 00:32:11,909
This is Alishan Station.

618
00:32:11,909 --> 00:32:15,443
We're going to see the famous sunrise and clouds.

619
00:32:15,443 --> 00:32:17,576
But the thing is...

620
00:32:17,576 --> 00:32:19,043
It's a bit too early, right?

621
00:32:19,043 --> 00:32:21,509
We came straight by train.

622
00:32:21,509 --> 00:32:23,643
- We'll get some sleep. / - I think...

623
00:32:23,643 --> 00:32:27,276
Your course is harder than my course.

624
00:32:27,276 --> 00:32:29,443
What kind of healing is this?

625
00:32:30,243 --> 00:32:31,309
This is how it's done.

626
00:32:31,309 --> 00:32:34,943
The sunrise and sea of clouds will

627
00:32:34,943 --> 00:32:36,443
wash away all your stress.

628
00:32:36,443 --> 00:32:37,243
Is that so?

629
00:32:37,243 --> 00:32:38,543
I'm a bit anxious.

630
00:32:38,543 --> 00:32:40,376
Didn't the time change?

631
00:32:40,376 --> 00:32:45,243
They say the time for the sunrise

632
00:32:45,243 --> 00:32:47,276
is announced the day before.

633
00:32:47,276 --> 00:32:50,443
You can look it up online

634
00:32:50,443 --> 00:32:52,309
so you don't miss out.

635
00:32:52,309 --> 00:32:54,476
But the thing is,

636
00:32:54,476 --> 00:32:57,809
there's a lot of rainfall in this region.

637
00:32:57,809 --> 00:33:00,243
So there are many foggy days.

638
00:33:00,243 --> 00:33:03,243
You can only see it 3 times per 10 days.

639
00:33:03,243 --> 00:33:05,509
We'd be really lucky if we see it today.

640
00:33:05,509 --> 00:33:08,643
- If we don't? / - It can't be helped then.

641
00:33:09,909 --> 00:33:11,709
Life is just like that.

642
00:33:11,709 --> 00:33:12,976
Let's hurry in.

643
00:33:12,976 --> 00:33:13,909
Check out the people.

644
00:33:13,909 --> 00:33:16,376
There are many people like us.

645
00:33:16,376 --> 00:33:18,676
I told you. This place is famous.

646
00:33:21,243 --> 00:33:26,243
(Only the diligent people can see the beauty of Alishan)

647
00:33:28,676 --> 00:33:32,476
(Alishan Station to Zhushan Station, 30 minutes)

648
00:33:33,309 --> 00:33:36,309
- See that electronic sign? / - Yes.

649
00:33:36,309 --> 00:33:38,809
- That's the number of tickets left. / - 322.

650
00:33:38,809 --> 00:33:40,676
They only have a limited amount of tickets?

651
00:33:40,676 --> 00:33:44,809
Only a set number of people can ride the train.

652
00:33:44,809 --> 00:33:45,409
Wow.

653
00:33:45,409 --> 00:33:47,876
350 people on weekdays.

654
00:33:48,676 --> 00:33:51,643
There's only one train for the sunrise.

655
00:33:51,643 --> 00:33:53,543
Check that out. It's decided.

656
00:33:53,543 --> 00:33:55,209
It keeps going down.

657
00:33:55,209 --> 00:33:59,376
- However... / - There's no way we'll miss out.

658
00:34:01,309 --> 00:34:04,309
($5.40 for tickets to Zhushan Station)

659
00:34:05,543 --> 00:34:06,943
(The count is precise)

660
00:34:06,943 --> 00:34:08,976
There are lots of foreigners too.

661
00:34:08,976 --> 00:34:10,443
They're all foreigners.

662
00:34:10,443 --> 00:34:12,343
There are no Koreans at all.

663
00:34:13,143 --> 00:34:15,476
Anyone from Korea?

664
00:34:16,776 --> 00:34:18,209
I guess not.

665
00:34:19,043 --> 00:34:21,743
Our train leaves at 20 past but I think it's coming now.

666
00:34:22,476 --> 00:34:24,076
That must be it.

667
00:34:24,076 --> 00:34:25,776
It's so cute.

668
00:34:25,776 --> 00:34:28,076
It's not the train I was thinking of.

669
00:34:28,709 --> 00:34:30,843
It just looks like a subway station. Right?

670
00:34:32,409 --> 00:34:35,043
(The train leaves for the mountain)

671
00:34:35,043 --> 00:34:36,243
It's really cramped, right?

672
00:34:36,543 --> 00:34:40,143
They made this during

673
00:34:40,143 --> 00:34:41,676
the imperial era.

674
00:34:41,676 --> 00:34:44,476
It's a little over 100 years old.

675
00:34:46,409 --> 00:34:48,543
Oh, really?

676
00:34:48,543 --> 00:34:51,776
- Doesn't it feel antique? / - Yes.

677
00:34:51,776 --> 00:34:54,609
Like going on a trip as a kid.

678
00:34:54,609 --> 00:34:55,309
Yes.

679
00:34:57,243 --> 00:34:58,609
It's that old bell.

680
00:35:04,043 --> 00:35:05,743
Red bean bread.

681
00:35:05,743 --> 00:35:06,676
Red bean bread.

682
00:35:09,543 --> 00:35:13,409
(It's so good)

683
00:35:17,909 --> 00:35:19,243
It's really good.

684
00:35:20,376 --> 00:35:21,943
Mom, do you see me?

685
00:35:23,009 --> 00:35:24,309
Do you see me, mom?

686
00:35:28,843 --> 00:35:30,609
Model?

687
00:35:30,609 --> 00:35:32,576
Are you a model?

688
00:35:32,576 --> 00:35:34,009
- Yes. / - Thank you.

689
00:35:34,876 --> 00:35:36,309
Not model.

690
00:35:37,109 --> 00:35:38,776
Why did you say you're a model?

691
00:35:38,776 --> 00:35:40,243
Tell him you're a singer?

692
00:35:40,243 --> 00:35:41,376
Just stay still.

693
00:35:41,376 --> 00:35:43,476
No...

694
00:35:43,476 --> 00:35:45,909
He'll think Korean models are all short.

695
00:35:45,909 --> 00:35:47,676
He'll know when I stand up.

696
00:35:49,943 --> 00:35:51,376
I see something.

697
00:35:53,043 --> 00:35:57,143
(They arrive at Zhushan Station)

698
00:36:02,709 --> 00:36:05,243
The last train is at,

699
00:36:05,243 --> 00:36:07,876
at 7:10.

700
00:36:07,876 --> 00:36:09,543
Looks like we have to get on that.

701
00:36:11,209 --> 00:36:13,876
Finally, we get to see the sunrise.

702
00:36:16,576 --> 00:36:18,143
So many stairs.

703
00:36:19,743 --> 00:36:20,876
Oh, my legs.

704
00:36:21,576 --> 00:36:22,809
Morning exercise.

705
00:36:23,509 --> 00:36:26,509
(Oh Amazing are working out early)

706
00:36:28,143 --> 00:36:29,309
So many people.

707
00:36:34,443 --> 00:36:36,109
Hey, there's something here.

708
00:36:36,109 --> 00:36:36,976
Wait a minute.

709
00:36:36,976 --> 00:36:38,809
This is too hard.

710
00:36:38,809 --> 00:36:40,109
Wait...

711
00:36:40,109 --> 00:36:41,576
- Seriously. / - Wait.

712
00:36:41,576 --> 00:36:44,176
Don't we need to get good seats?

713
00:36:46,309 --> 00:36:47,543
I hope not.

714
00:36:50,709 --> 00:36:52,909
(They start mountain climbing to get a good spot)

715
00:36:52,909 --> 00:36:54,709
That wasn't the end.

716
00:36:56,043 --> 00:36:58,743
(Hurrying to get there on time for the 6:20 sunrise)

717
00:37:00,909 --> 00:37:01,976
We're here.

718
00:37:04,476 --> 00:37:06,076
- So hard. / - This is nothing.

719
00:37:06,076 --> 00:37:07,743
I must be really unfit.

720
00:37:08,543 --> 00:37:10,076
- Here... / - Wow.

721
00:37:10,876 --> 00:37:12,143
Check it out.

722
00:37:12,143 --> 00:37:13,609
- Here... / - Wow.

723
00:37:14,376 --> 00:37:15,643
Check it out.

724
00:37:16,343 --> 00:37:17,743
- Amazing. / - That's the sea clouds.

725
00:37:19,043 --> 00:37:20,976
I'm a little nervous because

726
00:37:20,976 --> 00:37:24,409
it rains a lot here.

727
00:37:24,409 --> 00:37:26,176
So it's foggy most days.

728
00:37:26,909 --> 00:37:29,309
You can only see it 3 times per 10 days.

729
00:37:32,843 --> 00:37:40,076
(Seeing the clouds from higher than Hallasan)

730
00:37:43,743 --> 00:37:53,143
(The sea of clouds before their feet)

731
00:38:11,576 --> 00:38:13,709
- Wow, amazing. / - Wow.

732
00:38:13,709 --> 00:38:14,943
We're really lucky.

733
00:38:14,943 --> 00:38:17,576
It's not easy to see this.

734
00:38:19,176 --> 00:38:21,509
This is higher than Hallasan.

735
00:38:22,343 --> 00:38:23,843
It really is high.

736
00:38:27,009 --> 00:38:28,409
So pretty.

737
00:38:29,776 --> 00:38:31,643
I feel my mind clearing.

738
00:38:32,743 --> 00:38:35,443
- What a sight. / - My heart feels warm.

739
00:38:35,443 --> 00:38:37,176
We're higher than the clouds.

740
00:38:41,209 --> 00:38:43,743
My ears are slightly hurting.

741
00:38:43,743 --> 00:38:44,843
- Really? / - Yes.

742
00:38:44,843 --> 00:38:46,209
I'm fine.

743
00:38:46,209 --> 00:38:48,409
My ears feel blocked.

744
00:38:48,409 --> 00:38:50,776
Now, if we can see the sunrise...

745
00:38:50,776 --> 00:38:51,909
It'll be amazing.

746
00:38:51,909 --> 00:38:55,943
(Sunrise due at 6:20)

747
00:39:00,976 --> 00:39:06,976
(The clouds part as the time nears for sunrise)

748
00:39:09,843 --> 00:39:11,776
It's time for the sunrise now.

749
00:39:13,909 --> 00:39:14,976
Wow.

750
00:39:14,976 --> 00:39:15,976
Wow...

751
00:39:20,376 --> 00:39:21,643
- Wow. / - It's rising.

752
00:39:23,376 --> 00:39:24,509
It's really bright.

753
00:39:27,109 --> 00:39:28,143
Amazing.

754
00:39:31,376 --> 00:39:32,809
It's so bright.

755
00:39:37,176 --> 00:39:38,076
Hayoung...

756
00:40:08,376 --> 00:40:09,409
Wow.

757
00:40:09,409 --> 00:40:10,343
Wow, wow.

758
00:40:14,809 --> 00:40:16,309
- Wow. / - It's rising!

759
00:40:17,743 --> 00:40:19,776
It's really bright.

760
00:40:19,776 --> 00:40:21,143
It's so bright.

761
00:40:25,776 --> 00:40:26,876
It's so bright.

762
00:40:29,843 --> 00:40:31,476
Cellophane glasses.

763
00:40:31,476 --> 00:40:32,976
What's this?

764
00:40:32,976 --> 00:40:33,976
Sunglasses.

765
00:40:35,309 --> 00:40:36,543
20 yuan.

766
00:40:40,643 --> 00:40:41,576
Yellow.

767
00:40:44,443 --> 00:40:45,643
It's really bright.

768
00:40:48,209 --> 00:40:49,776
So bright.

769
00:40:50,643 --> 00:40:52,209
These glasses...

770
00:40:53,943 --> 00:40:55,009
They're not working.

771
00:40:57,743 --> 00:41:00,009
- Chorong. / - Yes.

772
00:41:00,009 --> 00:41:02,409
Your guide schedule is too tight.

773
00:41:03,843 --> 00:41:05,943
It's worse than mine.

774
00:41:05,943 --> 00:41:07,743
No, in the morning...

775
00:41:08,409 --> 00:41:11,376
It's so leisurely since we have a lot of time.

776
00:41:11,376 --> 00:41:13,343
- Now... / - Where are we?

777
00:41:13,343 --> 00:41:14,976
The place I mentioned earlier.

778
00:41:14,976 --> 00:41:16,643
Sister Pond.

779
00:41:16,643 --> 00:41:19,276
We're going to check out the pond.

780
00:41:20,809 --> 00:41:23,409
It must be called Sister Pond.

781
00:41:24,476 --> 00:41:26,109
Check this out.

782
00:41:26,109 --> 00:41:27,576
- It's like a door. / - Wow.

783
00:41:29,709 --> 00:41:30,576
How did it grow like this?

784
00:41:30,576 --> 00:41:31,876
It's a tree tunnel.

785
00:41:33,609 --> 00:41:35,509
Passing the tunnel.

786
00:41:39,376 --> 00:41:41,009
It's really pretty here.

787
00:41:44,976 --> 00:41:52,143
(It's like a scene from a music video)

788
00:42:03,143 --> 00:42:04,943
Wow, so pretty.

789
00:42:04,943 --> 00:42:06,943
- Is it here? / - We should've shot our...

790
00:42:06,943 --> 00:42:08,076
Music video here.

791
00:42:09,843 --> 00:42:11,309
I see the pond.

792
00:42:12,143 --> 00:42:13,309
Wow.

793
00:42:13,309 --> 00:42:14,176
This must be it.

794
00:42:14,176 --> 00:42:15,043
Seriously.

795
00:42:16,276 --> 00:42:18,309
It's fascinating that a pond is here.

796
00:42:18,309 --> 00:42:19,376
Oh, this.

797
00:42:20,976 --> 00:42:22,909
This is the younger sister's pond.

798
00:42:22,909 --> 00:42:25,143
- Younger sister. / - Hayoung Pond.

799
00:42:25,143 --> 00:42:26,476
There are two ponds,

800
00:42:26,476 --> 00:42:28,809
younger sister and older sister.

801
00:42:28,809 --> 00:42:30,309
They loved the same guy?

802
00:42:30,309 --> 00:42:32,243
It's no fun if you spoil it.

803
00:42:32,243 --> 00:42:33,576
I didn't know.

804
00:42:33,576 --> 00:42:34,576
I just guessed.

805
00:42:34,576 --> 00:42:35,976
Did they really love the same guy?

806
00:42:35,976 --> 00:42:37,009
- Yeah. / - Wow.

807
00:42:37,009 --> 00:42:40,743
The sisters loved the same guy.

808
00:42:40,743 --> 00:42:41,776
Why...

809
00:42:41,776 --> 00:42:44,376
So the sisters jumped

810
00:42:44,376 --> 00:42:45,509
in together...

811
00:42:45,509 --> 00:42:47,043
That's so sad.

812
00:42:48,443 --> 00:42:51,076
That'll never happen to our members.

813
00:42:51,076 --> 00:42:53,709
- You can't fight over a guy. / - Yeah.

814
00:42:53,709 --> 00:42:55,709
You just have to concede.

815
00:42:55,709 --> 00:42:56,843
As if that's easy to do.

816
00:42:56,843 --> 00:42:58,709
Just don't meet him.

817
00:42:58,709 --> 00:43:00,209
The guy was the bad one.

818
00:43:00,209 --> 00:43:03,143
He did that to sisters...

819
00:43:03,143 --> 00:43:04,476
So this is the younger sister's pond.

820
00:43:04,476 --> 00:43:06,709
The older sister's is further up.

821
00:43:08,809 --> 00:43:11,509
It's such a tragedy.

822
00:43:12,643 --> 00:43:14,443
Our members all like different types of guys

823
00:43:14,443 --> 00:43:16,243
so this will never happen.

824
00:43:16,243 --> 00:43:17,909
We really have different tastes.

825
00:43:17,909 --> 00:43:19,043
Very clear.

826
00:43:19,043 --> 00:43:21,476
The older sister's pond is a little bigger.

827
00:43:22,743 --> 00:43:25,376
Oh, no. It's so sad.

828
00:43:27,476 --> 00:43:29,009
Why did it happen?

829
00:43:30,043 --> 00:43:31,909
They probably had their reasons.

830
00:43:31,909 --> 00:43:33,343
But it doesn't look that deep.

831
00:43:34,076 --> 00:43:36,876
This is a naturally formed pond.

832
00:43:36,876 --> 00:43:38,076
Oh, my.

833
00:43:38,076 --> 00:43:41,276
These ponds always...

834
00:43:41,276 --> 00:43:42,876
Have such stories.

835
00:43:42,876 --> 00:43:45,309
Wow. Loving the same guy...

836
00:43:45,309 --> 00:43:48,109
You could make a movie or drama out of this.

837
00:43:48,576 --> 00:43:50,543
We started really early today

838
00:43:50,543 --> 00:43:52,776
and saw the sunrise.

839
00:43:52,776 --> 00:43:55,409
We looked around Alishan Range. How was it?

840
00:43:56,409 --> 00:43:59,609
The mountain is different to the mountains in Korea.

841
00:44:00,109 --> 00:44:01,909
The trees are taller.

842
00:44:01,909 --> 00:44:03,476
They have ponds.

843
00:44:03,476 --> 00:44:05,709
It was unfamiliar

844
00:44:05,709 --> 00:44:07,076
and fascinating.

845
00:44:07,076 --> 00:44:10,776
Thank you for showing me this, Guide Park.

846
00:44:10,776 --> 00:44:12,576
- Now we should... / - Since we're hungry...

847
00:44:12,576 --> 00:44:13,809
Let's go eat.

848
00:44:13,809 --> 00:44:15,709
Yes, let's go eat.

849
00:44:15,709 --> 00:44:17,509
- To eat something good. / - Let's go.

850
00:44:18,643 --> 00:44:23,976
(Alishan Range to eat brunch, 1 hour 10 minutes)

851
00:44:27,843 --> 00:44:33,143
(A boar rock welcomes them)

852
00:44:38,676 --> 00:44:40,176
This is...

853
00:44:40,176 --> 00:44:42,276
Alishan...

854
00:44:42,276 --> 00:44:44,843
Where the Tsou people live.

855
00:44:44,843 --> 00:44:46,476
Let's go eat good food.

856
00:44:46,476 --> 00:44:48,043
- Tsou people? / - Yeah.

857
00:44:48,043 --> 00:44:49,843
- What do you think we'll eat? / - Soup...

858
00:44:49,843 --> 00:44:52,376
Traditional Tsou food.

859
00:44:52,376 --> 00:44:53,843
You'd think that but...

860
00:44:53,843 --> 00:44:55,843
It'll be something totally different.

861
00:44:55,843 --> 00:44:56,909
We're eating pizza.

862
00:44:56,909 --> 00:44:59,343
- We're here for pizza. / - What?

863
00:44:59,343 --> 00:45:00,743
The Tsou people...

864
00:45:02,209 --> 00:45:07,943
(A new type of pizza in the mountains)

865
00:45:12,176 --> 00:45:18,043
(Who will come all the way here for pizza?)

866
00:45:21,843 --> 00:45:29,043
(Oh Amazing Tour will)

867
00:45:33,543 --> 00:45:36,176
Isn't it strange eating pizza here?

868
00:45:36,176 --> 00:45:37,643
Wow.

869
00:45:37,643 --> 00:45:38,809
Thank you.

870
00:45:40,043 --> 00:45:41,176
It's insane.

871
00:45:41,176 --> 00:45:42,343
Chorong!

872
00:45:43,743 --> 00:45:45,109
Is this heaven?

873
00:45:46,609 --> 00:45:47,476
Barbecue!

874
00:45:48,043 --> 00:45:49,009
Oh, my God.

875
00:45:49,009 --> 00:45:50,576
Thank you.

876
00:45:50,576 --> 00:45:52,409
Thank you. Wow.

877
00:45:57,509 --> 00:46:00,509
(Organic pumpkin sweet potato pizza, $14.40)

878
00:46:00,509 --> 00:46:03,476
(Barbecue set, $18)

879
00:46:05,376 --> 00:46:07,009
Should we try the pizza first?

880
00:46:09,209 --> 00:46:10,609
Check this out.

881
00:46:11,743 --> 00:46:14,576
(The pizza is deeply moving)

882
00:46:15,209 --> 00:46:16,843
It's really crispy.

883
00:46:21,943 --> 00:46:25,443
(They can't help but hum)

884
00:46:26,743 --> 00:46:27,643
Amazing.

885
00:46:29,676 --> 00:46:30,843
It's so good.

886
00:46:33,243 --> 00:46:35,209
Who knew we'd eat pizza deep in the mountains?

887
00:46:35,209 --> 00:46:37,243
- This is a sweet potato cheese pizza. / - Yeah.

888
00:46:38,009 --> 00:46:39,543
- It's so good. / - Wow.

889
00:46:41,443 --> 00:46:43,476
- It's a very Korean pizza. / - Yeah.

890
00:46:44,376 --> 00:46:47,009
Pizza usually taste different overseas.

891
00:46:47,009 --> 00:46:49,009
- It's usually saltier. / - But this is totally Korean.

892
00:46:51,576 --> 00:46:52,676
It's so good.

893
00:46:54,643 --> 00:46:55,743
It's really good.

894
00:47:02,809 --> 00:47:03,576
I'm happy.

895
00:47:03,576 --> 00:47:05,376
You can't not like this.

896
00:47:06,476 --> 00:47:08,809
I never imagined we'd have pizza here.

897
00:47:09,576 --> 00:47:12,943
(They cleared 2 pieces in an instant)

898
00:47:14,409 --> 00:47:18,709
(Next is the barbecue set)

899
00:47:22,276 --> 00:47:23,843
Check this out.

900
00:47:23,843 --> 00:47:25,643
There's so much.

901
00:47:25,643 --> 00:47:27,843
Isn't it like wrap for pork belly?

902
00:47:27,843 --> 00:47:30,676
Cucumber, cherry tomatoes and paprika too.

903
00:47:30,676 --> 00:47:33,543
You eat it with the vegetables.

904
00:47:34,843 --> 00:47:36,609
Doesn't it really look like pork belly?

905
00:47:37,443 --> 00:47:38,809
It's like pork belly.

906
00:47:38,809 --> 00:47:40,209
- Is this a spicy sauce? / - Yeah.

907
00:47:42,176 --> 00:47:43,376
Chorong!

908
00:47:43,376 --> 00:47:44,443
Isn't it like Korean mixed paste?

909
00:47:44,443 --> 00:47:45,609
Chorong!

910
00:47:45,609 --> 00:47:46,743
Isn't it like Korean mixed paste?

911
00:47:46,743 --> 00:47:48,076
It's exactly the same.

912
00:47:49,176 --> 00:47:51,909
This is like a fusion Korean restaurant.

913
00:47:55,476 --> 00:47:57,643
(Straight into her mouth)

914
00:48:00,076 --> 00:48:00,909
How is it?

915
00:48:02,643 --> 00:48:05,776
(This taste!)

916
00:48:06,576 --> 00:48:07,809
Did I choose well?

917
00:48:10,643 --> 00:48:12,143
I feel like I'm eating boiled pork.

918
00:48:13,209 --> 00:48:15,109
This is totally Korean.

919
00:48:15,109 --> 00:48:16,376
It's spicy.

920
00:48:16,376 --> 00:48:17,676
It's so good

921
00:48:18,843 --> 00:48:20,509
This one tastes like pork hocks.

922
00:48:20,509 --> 00:48:22,409
The sausages.

923
00:48:22,409 --> 00:48:23,576
What is this?

924
00:48:23,576 --> 00:48:25,809
It feels like duck.

925
00:48:26,943 --> 00:48:27,976
It's totally pork hocks.

926
00:48:29,943 --> 00:48:30,776
It's good, right?

927
00:48:32,443 --> 00:48:34,476
This is totally Korean food.

928
00:48:34,476 --> 00:48:35,809
How can it be so perfect?

929
00:48:39,609 --> 00:48:41,609
We're becoming silent.

930
00:48:41,609 --> 00:48:43,676
You miss Korean food when you go on trips.

931
00:48:45,009 --> 00:48:46,609
We can just come here.

932
00:48:46,609 --> 00:48:47,643
Boiled pork and pork hock set.

933
00:48:48,576 --> 00:48:49,743
Pork belly.

934
00:48:51,409 --> 00:48:54,543
This restaurant really cares about the environment.

935
00:48:55,443 --> 00:48:57,109
They don't allow takeout.

936
00:48:57,109 --> 00:48:58,709
See the container?

937
00:48:58,709 --> 00:49:00,809
You can't leave any.

938
00:49:00,809 --> 00:49:01,976
I'm confident.

939
00:49:01,976 --> 00:49:03,376
You can do it, right?

940
00:49:04,643 --> 00:49:05,909
We have to finish all this.

941
00:49:07,176 --> 00:49:08,076
It's so good.

942
00:49:13,909 --> 00:49:18,809
(She adds pork and sausage on lettuce)

943
00:49:24,276 --> 00:49:25,243
Good?

944
00:49:29,276 --> 00:49:31,509
I think my course has been a little better so far.

945
00:49:31,509 --> 00:49:32,743
- Really? / - Yeah.

946
00:49:32,743 --> 00:49:34,643
The sunrise was great but...

947
00:49:34,643 --> 00:49:36,409
But not active stuff like that...

948
00:49:36,409 --> 00:49:37,709
What else have you prepared?

949
00:49:37,709 --> 00:49:38,676
You'll find out.

950
00:49:38,676 --> 00:49:39,943
- Let's go. / - Okay.

951
00:49:39,943 --> 00:49:41,776
We still have a lot left to do.

952
00:49:45,709 --> 00:49:51,209
(Brunch to Tsou culture village, 70 minutes)

953
00:49:52,543 --> 00:49:54,643
(Tsou culture village)

954
00:49:54,643 --> 00:49:57,443
(A village where Tsou people live)

955
00:49:57,443 --> 00:50:04,343
(You can experience traditional Tsou culture here)

956
00:50:07,543 --> 00:50:08,943
Here...

957
00:50:08,943 --> 00:50:11,776
Tsou people of Alishan.

958
00:50:13,009 --> 00:50:16,109
It's their village.

959
00:50:16,109 --> 00:50:17,443
But here...

960
00:50:18,543 --> 00:50:21,409
We've arranged to meet them.

961
00:50:21,409 --> 00:50:22,743
Who?

962
00:50:22,743 --> 00:50:23,809
Who are we meeting?

963
00:50:24,709 --> 00:50:26,843
I called them in advance.

964
00:50:27,943 --> 00:50:30,976
Someone's waiting for us?

965
00:50:30,976 --> 00:50:32,209
It's them.

966
00:50:33,009 --> 00:50:34,943
Hello.

967
00:50:34,943 --> 00:50:35,976
Hello.

968
00:50:35,976 --> 00:50:37,109
Wow, what's this?

969
00:50:38,509 --> 00:50:39,743
What is this?

970
00:50:44,309 --> 00:50:49,176
(The traditional Tsou greeting begins)

971
00:50:50,809 --> 00:50:55,443
(What's going on here?)

972
00:51:08,643 --> 00:51:09,976
Thank you.

973
00:51:09,976 --> 00:51:11,009
Wow.

974
00:51:11,009 --> 00:51:12,409
- They gave us necklaces. / - Wow.

975
00:51:15,676 --> 00:51:16,509
Wow.

976
00:51:20,043 --> 00:51:20,943
What was that?

977
00:51:20,943 --> 00:51:22,443
Let's just follow them.

978
00:51:24,609 --> 00:51:25,843
Are they looking for something?

979
00:51:27,043 --> 00:51:28,409
- Wow. / - Wow, what's this?

980
00:51:29,109 --> 00:51:31,509
(Alishan oolong tea)

981
00:51:31,509 --> 00:51:35,109
(The high altitude provides an ideal condition)

982
00:51:35,109 --> 00:51:37,843
(For cultivating for the best tea in Taiwan)

983
00:51:40,843 --> 00:51:43,076
- Wow. We get to sample the tea. / - Wow.

984
00:51:44,176 --> 00:51:45,909
Proper oolong tea.

985
00:51:47,743 --> 00:51:50,609
- Wow. / - She lets it overflow.

986
00:51:50,609 --> 00:51:51,909
What a waste.

987
00:51:54,976 --> 00:51:56,576
(How Tsou people make oolong tea)

988
00:51:56,576 --> 00:51:58,476
(The first batch of warm water is to awaken the leaves)

989
00:51:58,476 --> 00:52:00,509
(It also acts to warm the cup)

990
00:52:03,509 --> 00:52:05,909
- She keeps overflowing. / - Very generous.

991
00:52:14,209 --> 00:52:16,443
The scent must infuse into everything.

992
00:52:16,443 --> 00:52:18,009
It'd clean it out.

993
00:52:19,943 --> 00:52:20,876
This must be to smell.

994
00:52:23,509 --> 00:52:24,909
And this must be to drink.

995
00:52:27,143 --> 00:52:28,243
I want to buy this.

996
00:52:32,009 --> 00:52:33,709
She throws away the first batch.

997
00:52:34,476 --> 00:52:36,376
The color is darker than earlier.

998
00:52:39,576 --> 00:52:41,209
I'm going to drink like this at home.

999
00:52:41,209 --> 00:52:42,543
Throw away the first batch.

1000
00:52:43,376 --> 00:52:44,276
With this...

1001
00:52:45,309 --> 00:52:47,043
Cover it.

1002
00:52:50,909 --> 00:52:51,843
It's too hot.

1003
00:52:52,376 --> 00:52:53,609
- Oh, it's too. / - That's hot.

1004
00:52:56,076 --> 00:52:56,743
That's hot.

1005
00:52:59,243 --> 00:53:00,576
It's hot!

1006
00:53:00,576 --> 00:53:01,409
Wait a minute.

1007
00:53:02,543 --> 00:53:03,676
How does she do it so easily?

1008
00:53:07,109 --> 00:53:07,976
It's hot.

1009
00:53:10,176 --> 00:53:11,376
So hot.

1010
00:53:13,943 --> 00:53:15,209
Oh, sorry.

1011
00:53:15,209 --> 00:53:16,543
It's okay.

1012
00:53:16,543 --> 00:53:17,776
I'm sorry.

1013
00:53:17,776 --> 00:53:18,876
This is hard.

1014
00:53:18,876 --> 00:53:20,676
That's my future. I'm too scared to do this.

1015
00:53:22,309 --> 00:53:25,343
(Hayoung succeeds at once)

1016
00:53:25,343 --> 00:53:26,476
You have to hold onto it tight.

1017
00:53:26,476 --> 00:53:26,743
Did I do it right?

1018
00:53:29,209 --> 00:53:30,809
It's hard.

1019
00:53:30,809 --> 00:53:31,643
So hot.

1020
00:53:32,343 --> 00:53:33,143
It's hot.

1021
00:53:36,143 --> 00:53:37,476
It's so hot.

1022
00:53:37,476 --> 00:53:38,609
It's hot.

1023
00:53:39,109 --> 00:53:40,009
It's like fresh made rice

1024
00:53:40,009 --> 00:53:42,076
served at a restaurant.

1025
00:53:45,909 --> 00:53:51,043
(The scent of oolong tea is left in the cup)

1026
00:53:51,043 --> 00:53:52,576
Oh, for real.

1027
00:53:52,576 --> 00:53:53,543
It's really savory.

1028
00:53:54,509 --> 00:53:55,543
The scent is so good.

1029
00:54:00,476 --> 00:54:01,876
We drink it like this?

1030
00:54:05,276 --> 00:54:10,609
(Drink tea as you smell the scent?)

1031
00:54:13,009 --> 00:54:15,076
(You don't have to keep that on your nose)

1032
00:54:15,076 --> 00:54:16,243
Oh, it's good.

1033
00:54:17,143 --> 00:54:18,443
It's so savory.

1034
00:54:20,043 --> 00:54:21,343
She's giving us more. Let's finish this.

1035
00:54:21,343 --> 00:54:24,576
Oolong tea is good for dieting...

1036
00:54:29,243 --> 00:54:30,643
You have to drink it while it's hot.

1037
00:54:32,076 --> 00:54:33,809
Isn't oolong tea

1038
00:54:33,809 --> 00:54:35,776
good for removing oils?

1039
00:54:35,776 --> 00:54:37,643
I drank it a lot back in the day.

1040
00:54:37,643 --> 00:54:38,476
To lose weight.

1041
00:54:38,476 --> 00:54:41,443
- We'd drink it after eating good food. / - Yeah.

1042
00:54:41,443 --> 00:54:43,309
- What's the use? / - Eat oily foods.

1043
00:54:43,309 --> 00:54:44,376
Then drink oolong tea.

1044
00:54:45,209 --> 00:54:47,409
It's much better after you enjoy the scent.

1045
00:54:47,409 --> 00:54:49,009
Can I do this?

1046
00:54:52,009 --> 00:54:52,976
I've improved.

1047
00:54:54,543 --> 00:54:56,009
This is fun.

1048
00:54:56,009 --> 00:54:57,276
It's different to just drinking.

1049
00:54:57,276 --> 00:54:58,576
Right?

1050
00:54:58,576 --> 00:54:59,576
It's so good.

1051
00:54:59,576 --> 00:55:02,776
Japanese oolong tea has a strong flavor.

1052
00:55:03,843 --> 00:55:06,443
This is very similar to green tea.

1053
00:55:06,443 --> 00:55:09,043
- Right? / - It's not bitter.

1054
00:55:09,043 --> 00:55:11,476
You thought it'd be bitter, right?

1055
00:55:11,476 --> 00:55:13,209
But it isn't bitter at all.

1056
00:55:14,909 --> 00:55:17,709
Is she going to keep pouring until we finish it all?

1057
00:55:21,143 --> 00:55:22,209
It's warm.

1058
00:55:32,943 --> 00:55:35,576
- Do we have to finish it to go home? / - Yeah.

1059
00:55:35,576 --> 00:55:37,809
- How about we drink from the bottle? / - I'm nervous.

1060
00:55:37,809 --> 00:55:38,909
Yeah, with a straw.

1061
00:55:38,909 --> 00:55:41,176
Thank you.

1062
00:55:41,176 --> 00:55:43,876
Doesn't it feel like the tea's digesting the food?

1063
00:55:43,876 --> 00:55:46,176
Now that I've digested, I feel like I need to eat again.

1064
00:55:46,843 --> 00:55:48,309
We definitely ate before this...

1065
00:55:49,043 --> 00:55:51,843
- The oil is all gone. / - You shove it down...

1066
00:55:51,843 --> 00:55:53,643
Then eat some more.

1067
00:55:54,576 --> 00:55:56,776
Let's eat again when we go down the mountain.

1068
00:55:56,776 --> 00:55:57,743
Since we hiked.

1069
00:55:58,909 --> 00:56:02,576
(Tsou culture village to lunch, 2 hours)

1070
00:56:03,743 --> 00:56:06,376
Since we went to the mountain,

1071
00:56:06,376 --> 00:56:07,909
what should we eat?

1072
00:56:07,909 --> 00:56:11,009
After the mountain, you need to re-energize.

1073
00:56:11,009 --> 00:56:14,243
Right. Normally after hiking,

1074
00:56:14,243 --> 00:56:16,609
people eat boiled chicken.

1075
00:56:17,309 --> 00:56:20,009
- So we'll eat chicken too. / - Wow.

1076
00:56:20,009 --> 00:56:23,109
There's a very famous restaurant here.

1077
00:56:23,109 --> 00:56:24,743
I looked it up.

1078
00:56:24,743 --> 00:56:26,076
It's this place right here.

1079
00:56:27,009 --> 00:56:28,676
- Wow. / - I smell something good.

1080
00:56:28,676 --> 00:56:29,776
Right?

1081
00:56:32,776 --> 00:56:37,443
(This place really feels local)

1082
00:56:38,109 --> 00:56:42,209
(They have a special recipe here)

1083
00:56:45,243 --> 00:56:47,643
What's this place famous for?

1084
00:56:47,643 --> 00:56:49,343
You're the...

1085
00:56:49,343 --> 00:56:50,276
- Right. / - Chorong guide.

1086
00:56:50,276 --> 00:56:52,109
It's the last dish for today

1087
00:56:52,109 --> 00:56:54,209
so I prepared something incredible.

1088
00:56:54,209 --> 00:56:57,009
And that's why I prepared chili sauce.

1089
00:56:57,009 --> 00:56:59,143
But I don't think you need it today.

1090
00:56:59,143 --> 00:57:00,276
- Really? / - Because...

1091
00:57:00,276 --> 00:57:02,143
We're going to have chicken.

1092
00:57:02,143 --> 00:57:04,776
I've ordered smoked chicken

1093
00:57:04,776 --> 00:57:06,409
and Taiwanese style chicken soup.

1094
00:57:06,409 --> 00:57:09,443
Smoked chicken dish is

1095
00:57:09,443 --> 00:57:14,443
skewered on bamboo and smoked.

1096
00:57:14,443 --> 00:57:20,443
They use a fruit tree called longan for the wood

1097
00:57:20,443 --> 00:57:21,909
to give the chicken fruity scent.

1098
00:57:21,909 --> 00:57:25,076
They salt the skin during the smoking.

1099
00:57:25,076 --> 00:57:27,743
And it's not just any salt. It's a secret salt.

1100
00:57:27,743 --> 00:57:29,009
Really? What kind of secret?

1101
00:57:29,009 --> 00:57:30,043
They won't say.

1102
00:57:31,409 --> 00:57:34,043
- A secret. / - A secret from a famous restaurant.

1103
00:57:36,109 --> 00:57:38,276
Wow, thank you. This must be it.

1104
00:57:38,276 --> 00:57:39,309
The chicken soup.

1105
00:57:40,309 --> 00:57:44,509
(Taiwanese style chicken soup in a big pot)

1106
00:57:44,509 --> 00:57:47,843
(With a variety of herbs)

1107
00:57:48,543 --> 00:57:51,676
(Taiwanese chicken soup, $30.60)

1108
00:57:51,943 --> 00:57:52,943
Let's try the chicken.

1109
00:57:53,943 --> 00:57:55,376
Just try a small piece.

1110
00:57:55,376 --> 00:57:57,276
Doesn't it look really good for you?

1111
00:57:58,243 --> 00:57:59,343
I'll taste it.

1112
00:58:00,776 --> 00:58:01,676
Oh, it's hot.

1113
00:58:03,776 --> 00:58:05,209
It's like boiled chicken.

1114
00:58:05,209 --> 00:58:06,776
It's like oriental medicine chicken soup.

1115
00:58:08,609 --> 00:58:10,609
The meat is so tender.

1116
00:58:10,609 --> 00:58:12,109
The broth itself...

1117
00:58:12,109 --> 00:58:15,009
They used local spices

1118
00:58:15,009 --> 00:58:16,309
so it's very deep.

1119
00:58:16,309 --> 00:58:19,309
The chicken is really firm and delicious.

1120
00:58:19,309 --> 00:58:20,476
It's very tender.

1121
00:58:20,476 --> 00:58:21,509
It's good.

1122
00:58:26,643 --> 00:58:28,043
I feel energized.

1123
00:58:30,243 --> 00:58:32,876
(They ate in silence)

1124
00:58:33,409 --> 00:58:35,976
(The smoked chicken is getting ready)

1125
00:58:37,276 --> 00:58:42,009
(It's been cooking for an hour)

1126
00:58:46,109 --> 00:58:48,843
(The smoked chicken is ready)

1127
00:58:50,343 --> 00:58:52,443
(Let's go meet it now)

1128
00:58:54,043 --> 00:58:55,176
Amazing!

1129
00:58:56,243 --> 00:58:57,609
I think I just saw something.

1130
00:58:58,609 --> 00:59:00,176
The head's still on it.

1131
00:59:00,176 --> 00:59:01,576
The head's still on it.

1132
00:59:06,676 --> 00:59:09,176
(Chicken arrived)

1133
00:59:10,776 --> 00:59:13,143
(The screen isn't on pause)

1134
00:59:13,143 --> 00:59:14,076
Hi.

1135
00:59:15,476 --> 00:59:16,609
You do look tasty.

1136
00:59:19,976 --> 00:59:22,209
(No way)

1137
00:59:22,443 --> 00:59:23,443
Hayoung.

1138
00:59:23,443 --> 00:59:24,709
Let's just cover its eyes.

1139
00:59:26,709 --> 00:59:27,743
Mommy.

1140
00:59:30,076 --> 00:59:31,576
It's done, Hayoung. Chicken!

1141
00:59:31,576 --> 00:59:33,343
I can see it's comb.

1142
00:59:34,543 --> 00:59:36,776
Should we just remove the neck?

1143
00:59:37,576 --> 00:59:38,176
Okay.

1144
00:59:38,176 --> 00:59:40,543
- Then you can eat it, right? / - Yes.

1145
00:59:43,643 --> 00:59:44,809
I'm sorry.

1146
00:59:44,809 --> 00:59:46,176
I think we'll lose.

1147
00:59:46,176 --> 00:59:47,176
It feels weird.

1148
00:59:47,176 --> 00:59:49,743
I think we'll lose if we do this.

1149
00:59:49,743 --> 00:59:51,109
Hide it.

1150
00:59:52,309 --> 00:59:53,409
I'm sorry.

1151
00:59:53,409 --> 00:59:54,343
Good-bye.

1152
00:59:55,209 --> 00:59:56,543
Which part do you like?

1153
00:59:56,543 --> 00:59:58,276
- Drumstick or... / - Drumstick.

1154
00:59:58,276 --> 00:59:59,643
Then the drumstick...

1155
00:59:59,643 --> 01:00:01,609
It's crossing its legs...

1156
01:00:01,609 --> 01:00:03,376
The drumstick.

1157
01:00:05,609 --> 01:00:08,243
(This is worse than the head)

1158
01:00:08,243 --> 01:00:09,743
I don't like the drumstick.

1159
01:00:09,743 --> 01:00:11,443
I don't like the drumstick.

1160
01:00:11,443 --> 01:00:12,643
Wait, wait, wait.

1161
01:00:12,643 --> 01:00:13,709
Just leave it there.

1162
01:00:13,709 --> 01:00:15,843
- What's the difference with the neck? / - I'll remove it.

1163
01:00:15,843 --> 01:00:17,709
- What's the difference? / - Here.

1164
01:00:17,709 --> 01:00:18,776
Okay, okay.

1165
01:00:18,776 --> 01:00:20,443
- Should we try this first? / - Yes.

1166
01:00:21,776 --> 01:00:25,076
(They finally taste it after overcoming some challenges)

1167
01:00:25,076 --> 01:00:26,243
It's good.

1168
01:00:27,543 --> 01:00:28,343
It's really good.

1169
01:00:29,309 --> 01:00:30,876
Peace has returned.

1170
01:00:32,276 --> 01:00:34,043
The chicken is really big

1171
01:00:34,043 --> 01:00:36,443
and the meat is really firm.

1172
01:00:36,443 --> 01:00:40,009
It's like how Korean chicken is.

1173
01:00:41,176 --> 01:00:42,976
I don't like the skin...

1174
01:00:42,976 --> 01:00:44,909
But this is really crispy.

1175
01:00:50,476 --> 01:00:52,309
Hayoung, try the skin.

1176
01:00:52,309 --> 01:00:54,743
You don't need to season it.

1177
01:00:54,743 --> 01:00:56,243
Eat it with this.

1178
01:00:59,409 --> 01:01:00,843
Now bite off some meat.

1179
01:01:03,209 --> 01:01:04,043
Awesome, right?

1180
01:01:07,709 --> 01:01:10,243
This skin is amazing.

1181
01:01:10,243 --> 01:01:11,376
It's really crispy.

1182
01:01:14,309 --> 01:01:17,143
I thought it'd be salty.

1183
01:01:17,143 --> 01:01:18,243
It's not salty at all.

1184
01:01:18,243 --> 01:01:20,343
Since it's been smoked...

1185
01:01:21,209 --> 01:01:22,776
It has a pleasant smell.

1186
01:01:22,776 --> 01:01:25,643
If you normally don't eat the skin, you'll eat this.

1187
01:01:34,343 --> 01:01:35,276
The wing is good.

1188
01:01:39,276 --> 01:01:42,643
Now that we've had a good meal.

1189
01:01:42,643 --> 01:01:44,076
The final...

1190
01:01:44,076 --> 01:01:46,143
It's the final course.

1191
01:01:46,143 --> 01:01:48,276
- The course we've been waiting for. / - Yes.

1192
01:01:48,276 --> 01:01:51,409
It's the thing I've been looking forward to the most.

1193
01:01:51,409 --> 01:01:52,376
The mud hot spring.

1194
01:01:52,376 --> 01:01:54,909
Our legs are sore from the hike.

1195
01:01:54,909 --> 01:01:56,609
Let's go and relieve our fatigue.

1196
01:01:56,609 --> 01:01:58,543
- I'm looking forward to it. / - Right?

1197
01:01:58,543 --> 01:02:00,476
- Let's finish up and go. / - Okay.

1198
01:02:02,143 --> 01:02:03,976
- Here. / - Here.

1199
01:02:03,976 --> 01:02:05,243
Guanziling Hot Spring?

1200
01:02:05,243 --> 01:02:06,643
This isn't an ordinary hot spring.

1201
01:02:06,643 --> 01:02:09,543
It's where you can do a mud bath.

1202
01:02:09,543 --> 01:02:11,709
Since we're a girl group...

1203
01:02:11,709 --> 01:02:14,609
- We need to take care of our skin. / - Of course.

1204
01:02:15,543 --> 01:02:18,343
(Only 3 minutes away from the restaurant)

1205
01:02:19,843 --> 01:02:21,676
Finally we're here.

1206
01:02:21,676 --> 01:02:23,043
The thing we've waited for.

1207
01:02:23,043 --> 01:02:25,409
- We're at the hot spring. / - We're here.

1208
01:02:25,976 --> 01:02:27,643
This is one of...

1209
01:02:27,643 --> 01:02:30,676
- The top four hot springs worldwide. / - Really?

1210
01:02:30,676 --> 01:02:33,176
It's called Guanziling Hot Spring.

1211
01:02:33,176 --> 01:02:34,209
Shall we go?

1212
01:02:34,209 --> 01:02:35,843
Shall we?

1213
01:02:35,843 --> 01:02:38,043
Isn't this all natural mud?

1214
01:02:38,043 --> 01:02:38,943
- Wow. / - Hayoung!

1215
01:02:38,943 --> 01:02:40,609
- Oh, my! / - It's really here.

1216
01:02:41,943 --> 01:02:42,809
Mud, mud.

1217
01:02:43,609 --> 01:02:44,743
Wow.

1218
01:02:44,743 --> 01:02:46,043
It's real mud.

1219
01:02:48,076 --> 01:02:49,509
Should we put on some mud?

1220
01:02:52,043 --> 01:02:52,943
Why? Is it cold?

1221
01:02:53,976 --> 01:02:55,043
It feels weird.

1222
01:02:57,109 --> 01:02:58,709
Wow, it's so soft.

1223
01:02:59,609 --> 01:03:00,343
Wow.

1224
01:03:01,176 --> 01:03:02,309
Wow.

1225
01:03:02,309 --> 01:03:03,743
(Rub)

1226
01:03:04,609 --> 01:03:05,243
Wow.

1227
01:03:05,243 --> 01:03:06,276
Come here, Chorong.

1228
01:03:07,376 --> 01:03:09,409
(Some for Chorong too)

1229
01:03:10,476 --> 01:03:11,643
Hey, it feels weird.

1230
01:03:15,009 --> 01:03:16,443
Hey!

1231
01:03:16,443 --> 01:03:18,809
This is so...

1232
01:03:18,809 --> 01:03:21,809
You have to pay for this at a massage shop.

1233
01:03:25,409 --> 01:03:26,376
Come here, Chorong.

1234
01:03:26,376 --> 01:03:27,476
I'll do this for you.

1235
01:03:27,476 --> 01:03:28,676
Draw something cute.

1236
01:03:29,576 --> 01:03:33,309
(Nice and cute)

1237
01:03:35,176 --> 01:03:37,643
(Chorong kitty)

1238
01:03:41,109 --> 01:03:42,009
Chief.

1239
01:03:46,143 --> 01:03:47,276
It feels so good.

1240
01:03:49,743 --> 01:03:50,843
Put some more on.

1241
01:03:50,843 --> 01:03:52,443
Can we just put on as much as we want?

1242
01:03:54,143 --> 01:03:57,743
(Girls)

1243
01:04:03,043 --> 01:04:04,309
Hayoung!

1244
01:04:05,409 --> 01:04:06,576
Apink, Apink.

1245
01:04:06,576 --> 01:04:08,676
- Apink, Apink. / - Oh, Apink.

1246
01:04:09,243 --> 01:04:10,776
Apink...

1247
01:04:14,443 --> 01:04:16,576
Nice. Perfect.

1248
01:04:16,576 --> 01:04:17,776
Shall we go and dry up?

1249
01:04:18,643 --> 01:04:20,009
It's all here.

1250
01:04:20,676 --> 01:04:22,076
Can we just sit here?

1251
01:04:24,643 --> 01:04:25,943
How does it feel with the mud?

1252
01:04:25,943 --> 01:04:27,609
It feels weird.

1253
01:04:27,609 --> 01:04:28,376
I've never felt this before.

1254
01:04:28,376 --> 01:04:30,909
I've never rubbed mud all over my body before.

1255
01:04:30,909 --> 01:04:31,976
- Yeah. / - Right?

1256
01:04:31,976 --> 01:04:33,476
The seasons are changing in Korea

1257
01:04:33,476 --> 01:04:36,076
and it's so cold now.

1258
01:04:36,076 --> 01:04:38,209
- Your skin gets really dry. / - Yeah.

1259
01:04:38,209 --> 01:04:40,143
I think this will be

1260
01:04:40,143 --> 01:04:41,409
really good for our skin.

1261
01:04:43,909 --> 01:04:44,976
What is this?

1262
01:04:46,276 --> 01:04:51,676
(Using all her strength to reach the straw)

1263
01:05:03,276 --> 01:05:05,009
We're going to look so funny.

1264
01:05:05,009 --> 01:05:06,176
Orange juice!

1265
01:05:07,143 --> 01:05:09,476
Everyone, I'm Chorong of Apink.

1266
01:05:09,476 --> 01:05:11,509
I'm getting drunk on orange juice.

1267
01:05:13,376 --> 01:05:15,276
What do we do now?

1268
01:05:15,276 --> 01:05:18,076
Now we wash this off

1269
01:05:18,076 --> 01:05:19,609
and hit the hot springs.

1270
01:05:20,476 --> 01:05:22,376
- Amazing, right? / - Yes.

1271
01:05:22,376 --> 01:05:25,776
- My mouth is hardening. / - Our faces are stiff.

1272
01:05:25,776 --> 01:05:27,776
We can't speak properly.

1273
01:05:27,776 --> 01:05:29,709
It's too tight around my mouth.

1274
01:05:29,709 --> 01:05:31,443
Don't smile, you'll get wrinkles.

1275
01:05:31,443 --> 01:05:32,976
We should've left our mouths.

1276
01:05:32,976 --> 01:05:34,376
I know.

1277
01:05:34,376 --> 01:05:36,443
- Should we go wash now? / - Let's wash.

1278
01:05:37,309 --> 01:05:39,443
Oh, my face...

1279
01:05:42,043 --> 01:05:46,809
(You must remove the mud before you hit the springs)

1280
01:05:48,476 --> 01:05:49,509
Mommy.

1281
01:05:49,509 --> 01:05:51,509
We have to dip our bodies...

1282
01:06:00,976 --> 01:06:02,876
My skin is green.

1283
01:06:04,276 --> 01:06:05,776
It's so soft.

1284
01:06:07,209 --> 01:06:08,309
It really is.

1285
01:06:09,009 --> 01:06:11,376
In order to have pretty skin.

1286
01:06:11,376 --> 01:06:14,409
I think the elders would love this.

1287
01:06:14,409 --> 01:06:16,643
My mom and dad would love this.

1288
01:06:20,709 --> 01:06:23,276
(Excited)

1289
01:06:29,043 --> 01:06:30,876
This is...

1290
01:06:30,876 --> 01:06:32,743
Should we score the hot spring?

1291
01:06:32,743 --> 01:06:35,076
- Hayoung, you do it. / - From what I see...

1292
01:06:35,076 --> 01:06:37,843
It deserves three "A"s!

1293
01:06:39,443 --> 01:06:42,043
You don't just have the hot spring here.

1294
01:06:42,043 --> 01:06:43,976
You have a hotel as well.

1295
01:06:43,976 --> 01:06:45,376
You can sleep here.

1296
01:06:45,376 --> 01:06:46,443
The important thing is...

1297
01:06:46,443 --> 01:06:49,209
You can use it even if you're not a hotel guest.

1298
01:06:50,043 --> 01:06:52,676
So we give it three "A"s.

1299
01:06:54,443 --> 01:06:55,943
We're really generous with scores, aren't we?

1300
01:06:55,943 --> 01:06:57,176
We are.

1301
01:06:57,176 --> 01:06:59,809
I think the Oh Amazing Tour was good.

1302
01:06:59,809 --> 01:07:00,609
It was good.

1303
01:07:00,609 --> 01:07:03,309
It wasn't too hard.

1304
01:07:03,309 --> 01:07:05,109
- Healing. / - Or too tiring.

1305
01:07:06,143 --> 01:07:08,843
(They planned the trip hard and enjoyed it fully)

1306
01:07:08,843 --> 01:07:11,943
Now we have to score this place with these.

1307
01:07:11,943 --> 01:07:13,476
One for ambience.

1308
01:07:13,476 --> 01:07:15,943
One because it's delicious.

1309
01:07:15,943 --> 01:07:18,409
One because it's affordable.

1310
01:07:18,409 --> 01:07:19,443
Three for me.

1311
01:07:19,443 --> 01:07:21,943
Another three "A"s for this place.

1312
01:07:21,943 --> 01:07:25,076
I think this place deserves three "A"s.

1313
01:07:28,209 --> 01:07:29,109
It was perfect.

1314
01:07:32,743 --> 01:07:34,743
Do you realize you've scored three for everything?

1315
01:07:36,043 --> 01:07:38,576
We lack objectivity...

1316
01:07:38,576 --> 01:07:40,109
But they were all good.

1317
01:07:40,109 --> 01:07:42,343
We have to be satisfied

1318
01:07:42,343 --> 01:07:44,843
for others to be satisfied too.

1319
01:07:44,843 --> 01:07:47,776
We have to show them that we really enjoyed it.

1320
01:07:48,576 --> 01:07:50,176
1, 2, 3.

1321
01:07:50,176 --> 01:07:51,809
Three!

Fuku, Fuku.

1329
01:08:15,976 --> 01:08:18,543
It's called the Mediterranean of Vietnam.

1330
01:08:18,543 --> 01:08:20,476
It's a hidden gem of a holiday spot.

1334

Nha Trang. It's a hot spring course.

1335
01:08:32,376 --> 01:08:34,309
My skin feels good.

1336
01:08:34,309 --> 01:08:35,443
I don't want to leave.

1337
01:08:36,443 --> 01:08:38,676
A local eatery.

1338
01:08:38,676 --> 01:08:39,643
This is nice.

1339
01:08:40,376 --> 01:08:41,543
It's really good.

1340
01:08:41,543 --> 01:08:42,509
So good.
