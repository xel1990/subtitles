1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,807
Let's go!

2
00:00:01,474 --> 00:00:03,274
We're heading to the winery.

3
00:00:03,974 --> 00:00:05,674
There is wine in every one of these?

4
00:00:06,374 --> 00:00:08,674
There is no end.

5
00:00:08,674 --> 00:00:10,774
- Ta-da. / - Wow.

6
00:00:10,774 --> 00:00:12,941
Each island is owned by someone.

7
00:00:12,941 --> 00:00:15,741
- Are we in the U.S. now? / - Yes, we are.

8
00:00:15,741 --> 00:00:17,274
This is cool.

9
00:00:17,974 --> 00:00:19,774
This place has an unexpected charm.

10
00:00:20,407 --> 00:00:22,174
I love it.

11
00:00:23,474 --> 00:00:25,674
(Which team will win?)

12
00:00:26,574 --> 00:00:30,174
(Numerous great tips on trips)

13
00:00:30,841 --> 00:00:32,007
(Seo Hyorim, Lee Honggi of FTISLAND)

14
00:00:32,941 --> 00:00:34,241
(Wendy and Seulgi of Red Velvet)

15
00:00:35,407 --> 00:00:36,874
(Special host, Lee Teuk)

16
00:00:37,441 --> 00:00:38,674
Travel is war.

17
00:00:38,674 --> 00:00:40,941
Battle Trip.

18
00:00:42,174 --> 00:00:43,374
Continuing on from last week,

19
00:00:43,374 --> 00:00:45,374
we have the trip planners that went to countries

20
00:00:45,374 --> 00:00:47,407
that we'd want to live in.

21
00:00:47,407 --> 00:00:49,174
- Nice to see you again. / - Hello.

22
00:00:49,174 --> 00:00:51,307
You're the winner of the 100th episode.

23
00:00:51,307 --> 00:00:52,907
Stop it.

24
00:00:54,474 --> 00:00:56,941
We have our 100 impartial judges in the audience

25
00:00:56,941 --> 00:00:58,807
who will vote on today's trips.

26
00:00:58,807 --> 00:01:00,674
- Welcome. / - Welcome.

27
00:01:01,774 --> 00:01:04,107
To celebrate our 100th episode,

28
00:01:04,107 --> 00:01:06,041
we've been on a same theme for 4 weeks.

29
00:01:06,041 --> 00:01:08,774
Today, we're going to small cities of Austria.

30
00:01:08,774 --> 00:01:10,907
Which cities are there other than Vienna?

31
00:01:10,907 --> 00:01:12,207
- I've been to Austria before. / - You went there.

32
00:01:12,207 --> 00:01:14,841
- Sook. / - It was about 10 years ago.

33
00:01:14,841 --> 00:01:16,374
Every place in Austria is nice.

34
00:01:16,374 --> 00:01:18,141
All the cities are beautiful.

35
00:01:18,141 --> 00:01:20,541
And I liked Hallstatt the most.

36
00:01:20,541 --> 00:01:22,941
Hallstatt is the name of a lake.

37
00:01:22,941 --> 00:01:24,041
- A lake? / - Yes.

38
00:01:24,041 --> 00:01:26,274
The lake is beautiful.

39
00:01:26,274 --> 00:01:28,241
As you walk on a street,

40
00:01:28,241 --> 00:01:30,507
you'll see rambling roses there.

41
00:01:30,507 --> 00:01:32,841
- Right. / - You can see them along the windows.

42
00:01:32,841 --> 00:01:34,574
And it is very leisurely

43
00:01:34,574 --> 00:01:36,574
because there are benches around the lake.

44
00:01:37,007 --> 00:01:38,307
So you can take a rest there.

45
00:01:39,074 --> 00:01:40,941
We mostly think of Switzerland with the Alps.

46
00:01:40,941 --> 00:01:43,407
But the Alps actually lays across many countries

47
00:01:43,407 --> 00:01:45,441
including Italy and Switzerland.

48
00:01:45,441 --> 00:01:48,541
And Austria has more mountains than Switzerland.

49
00:01:49,007 --> 00:01:51,541
There are twice as many mountains in Austria

50
00:01:51,541 --> 00:01:53,674
than in Switzerland.

51
00:01:53,674 --> 00:01:54,941
Two-thirds of Austrian territory

52
00:01:54,941 --> 00:01:56,307
is covered with the Alps.

53
00:01:56,541 --> 00:01:58,474
A lot of the movies have the scenes

54
00:01:58,474 --> 00:02:01,541
where people run as the camera moves back.

55
00:02:01,541 --> 00:02:03,541
I bet you did that.

56
00:02:03,941 --> 00:02:05,207
It's a beautiful country anyway.

57
00:02:05,407 --> 00:02:07,441
Many Austrian sites are listed as

58
00:02:07,441 --> 00:02:09,307
UNESCO World Heritage sites.

59
00:02:09,307 --> 00:02:11,107
- But that's no easy task. / - Right.

60
00:02:11,107 --> 00:02:13,207
Korea also has a lot of UNESCO World Heritage Sites.

61
00:02:13,207 --> 00:02:15,807
- We have Gyeongju. / - Historic district of Gyeongju.

62
00:02:15,807 --> 00:02:18,474
And the Jeju Volcanic Island and Lava Tubes.

63
00:02:18,807 --> 00:02:22,007
Dolmens in Gochang, Hwasun and Ganghwa.

64
00:02:22,007 --> 00:02:23,541
What places do Austria have?

65
00:02:23,541 --> 00:02:26,474
There's the Old Town of Salzburg.

66
00:02:26,474 --> 00:02:31,007
- And Hallstatt that Sook mentioned. / - Hallstatt?

67
00:02:31,007 --> 00:02:34,807
And Graz is the second biggest city in Austria.

68
00:02:34,807 --> 00:02:38,241
The city still has a lot of medieval buildings,

69
00:02:38,241 --> 00:02:40,807
so the whole city is designated as a

70
00:02:40,807 --> 00:02:42,074
UNESCO World Heritage Site.

71
00:02:42,074 --> 00:02:43,641
And there are Melk and Krems

72
00:02:43,641 --> 00:02:44,974
located along the Danube,

73
00:02:44,974 --> 00:02:46,507
and Wachau Cultural Landscape that's

74
00:02:46,507 --> 00:02:47,807
located between those towns are

75
00:02:47,807 --> 00:02:50,007
also listed as UNESCO World Heritage Sites.

76
00:02:50,007 --> 00:02:52,841
And we've been there.

77
00:02:52,841 --> 00:02:54,107
- Did you go there? / - Yes.

78
00:02:54,107 --> 00:02:55,341
Let's look at the map.

79
00:02:55,341 --> 00:02:57,574
- I don't know where they are. / - Let's.

80
00:02:57,574 --> 00:03:00,307
In that area with those cities including Krems,

81
00:03:00,307 --> 00:03:03,674
people have lived for more than a thousand years.

82
00:03:03,674 --> 00:03:07,607
So the places look just as they did in the old days.

83
00:03:07,607 --> 00:03:10,407
That's why they're designated by UNESCO.

84
00:03:10,407 --> 00:03:12,307
If it has a thousand years of history

85
00:03:12,307 --> 00:03:13,941
and listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site,

86
00:03:13,941 --> 00:03:15,941
everywhere you went probably looked amazing.

87
00:03:15,941 --> 00:03:19,074
There are a lot of villages with grape vines

88
00:03:19,074 --> 00:03:20,541
and popular restaurants in Krems.

89
00:03:20,541 --> 00:03:22,941
You can also visit a beer factory there.

90
00:03:23,407 --> 00:03:24,807
No problems if we have a beer factory.

91
00:03:24,807 --> 00:03:27,907
- Beer factory. / - Whoo!

92
00:03:27,907 --> 00:03:30,374
The city has almost everything.

93
00:03:30,374 --> 00:03:32,741
When you went to Hungary,

94
00:03:32,741 --> 00:03:34,807
the trip designers went to the Danube in Budapest.

95
00:03:34,807 --> 00:03:36,341
- Right. / - They did.

96
00:03:36,341 --> 00:03:38,774
In front of the National Assembly building.

97
00:03:38,774 --> 00:03:41,007
That river starts from Germany

98
00:03:41,007 --> 00:03:44,807
and it passes through Austria to Hungary.

99
00:03:44,807 --> 00:03:47,641
And we crossed the river on a cruise ship.

100
00:03:47,641 --> 00:03:49,707
We'll see the beautiful night view then?

101
00:03:49,707 --> 00:03:50,974
Yes, it will be amazing.

102
00:03:50,974 --> 00:03:53,874
When you are in Austria, you must go to Salzburg.

103
00:03:53,874 --> 00:03:56,774
- Salzburg? / - That's the Santa Clause village.

104
00:03:56,774 --> 00:03:58,241
Salzburg is where Santa came from.

105
00:03:58,241 --> 00:03:59,741
- That's right. / - Really?

106
00:03:59,741 --> 00:04:00,874
- What's her job? / - I didn't know.

107
00:04:00,874 --> 00:04:02,641
Seriously, what is her real job?

108
00:04:02,641 --> 00:04:04,807
She's like a travel writer who does part-time acting.

109
00:04:05,841 --> 00:04:07,541
Acting is her hobby.

110
00:04:07,541 --> 00:04:09,807
- So, they went to Salzburg. / - How did you get there?

111
00:04:09,807 --> 00:04:11,841
Hyorim and Honggi rode in a helicopter.

112
00:04:11,841 --> 00:04:13,241
What did you do in Salzburg?

113
00:04:13,241 --> 00:04:14,274
Did you enjoy activities?

114
00:04:14,274 --> 00:04:16,207
- You should've rode something. / - Of course.

115
00:04:16,207 --> 00:04:18,507
- Tell us. / - We enjoyed the Alps...

116
00:04:18,507 --> 00:04:21,574
And the downtown of Salzburg at once.

117
00:04:21,574 --> 00:04:23,807
- We went paragliding. / - Paragliding?

118
00:04:23,807 --> 00:04:25,474
Please look forward to it.

119
00:04:25,474 --> 00:04:26,574
I want to try paragliding.

120
00:04:26,574 --> 00:04:29,974
Alright. It has "The Sound of Music" and the Alps.

121
00:04:29,974 --> 00:04:32,874
Digidigidip Tour's trip to Austria.

122
00:04:32,874 --> 00:04:34,174
Let's check out the small city trip.

123
00:04:36,041 --> 00:04:38,341
We're going to the small cities of Austria.

124
00:04:39,074 --> 00:04:40,874
It looks different from Canada.

125
00:04:40,874 --> 00:04:42,074
It's pretty already.

126
00:04:45,741 --> 00:04:53,407
(The everlasting medieval city that loves art, Vienna)

127
00:04:53,407 --> 00:04:55,741
We're going really deep today.

128
00:04:57,474 --> 00:04:59,774
Wow, this is huge. I had no idea.

129
00:05:04,141 --> 00:05:06,474
Now this is Europe.

130
00:05:12,674 --> 00:05:15,007
It's like our time together is just ours.

131
00:05:16,474 --> 00:05:17,874
I feel like a local.

132
00:05:17,874 --> 00:05:19,274

133
00:05:20,907 --> 00:05:22,874

- It's so pretty. / - The colors are so amazing.

135
00:05:26,607 --> 00:05:29,274
- This is so nice. / - Why is that house so pretty?

136
00:05:32,607 --> 00:05:34,441
Wow, it's so nice here.

137
00:05:35,107 --> 00:05:37,041
I'm so happy just to be walking here.

138
00:05:37,041 --> 00:05:39,107
I remember the scenes from the movies.

139
00:05:39,107 --> 00:05:41,274
We're visiting the places in "The Sound of Music."

140
00:05:42,641 --> 00:05:44,507
Everything is just perfect.

141
00:05:46,207 --> 00:05:49,607
(Their trip becomes even more thrilling)

142
00:05:49,607 --> 00:05:52,441
The world I see is even more beautiful.

143
00:05:54,107 --> 00:05:56,741
- You like? / - I love it!

144

(It's the 3rd day of Digidigidip Tour)

146
00:06:02,374 --> 00:06:04,874
Oh, Bahnhof.

147
00:06:04,874 --> 00:06:06,207
Is that the train station?

148
00:06:06,207 --> 00:06:07,574
Bahnhof means train station.

149
00:06:07,574 --> 00:06:10,107
It's my day today.

150
00:06:10,107 --> 00:06:11,574
You planned today, right? You planned it well, right?

151
00:06:11,574 --> 00:06:14,341
Since it's my day...

152
00:06:14,341 --> 00:06:15,674
I'm getting nervous.

153
00:06:15,674 --> 00:06:18,141
My hobby is discovering songs

154
00:06:18,141 --> 00:06:19,274
that people don't know about.

155
00:06:19,274 --> 00:06:21,407
- That's right. / - I want our trip to be different.

156
00:06:21,941 --> 00:06:23,741
I wanted to find hidden spots

157

that people wouldn't know about.

158
00:06:25,707 --> 00:06:27,574
- Krems. / - Krems?

159
00:06:28,507 --> 00:06:30,307
And the port in Salzburg.

Right?

168
00:06:49,941 --> 00:06:52,641
They have beer there.

169
00:06:52,641 --> 00:06:54,941
We'll drink some beer at the beer factory.

170
00:06:54,941 --> 00:06:56,507

171

- Mozart's hometown. / - It's Mozart's hometown.

Salzburg is famous for "The Sound of Music."

173

I can't wait to see this.

00:07:22,507 --> 00:07:25,307
- For our... / - Fun trip.

183
00:07:25,307 --> 00:07:26,707
- Wendy. / - Seulgi.

184
00:07:26,707 --> 00:07:28,441
Digidigidip!

185
00:07:28,441 --> 00:07:29,607
Let's go.

186
00:07:30,441 --> 00:07:31,607
Let's go.

187
00:07:32,641 --> 00:07:33,907
I guess you went there by train.

188
00:07:33,907 --> 00:07:35,307
- Yes, we took the train there. / - Yes.

189
00:07:35,307 --> 00:07:38,174
From our hotel, the one-way ticket was $23.

190
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:41,741
We're in Krems now.

191
00:07:41,741 --> 00:07:43,107
- Krems? / - Yes.

192
00:07:43,107 --> 00:07:45,907
It's the hidden spot I told you about earlier.

193
00:07:45,907 --> 00:07:49,407
The buildings here are pretty and famous.

194
00:07:49,407 --> 00:07:52,674
- It's enlisted on UNESCO too. / - Really?

195
00:07:53,107 --> 00:07:55,441
Didn't I tell you earlier?

196
00:07:55,441 --> 00:07:57,407
Didn't I tell you about the river? The Danube.

197
00:07:57,407 --> 00:08:00,641
- The Danube? / - Yes, this is the Danube.

198
00:08:00,641 --> 00:08:03,441
- Really? / - The second longest river in Europe.

199
00:08:03,441 --> 00:08:04,741
- Seriously? / - Yes.

200
00:08:04,741 --> 00:08:07,441
("The Blue Danube" by Johann Strauss)

201
00:08:08,341 --> 00:08:13,574
(The Danube runs from Germany to Romania)

202
00:08:15,974 --> 00:08:17,941
- This is beautiful. / - Look at the village.

203
00:08:17,941 --> 00:08:21,141
- Oh. It's so picturesque. / - We'll take the cruise...

204
00:08:21,141 --> 00:08:23,674
And admire the scenery and surroundings...

205
00:08:23,674 --> 00:08:25,674
- Of Krems. / - You can go through the river?

206
00:08:25,674 --> 00:08:26,941
You can go around on the cruise.

207
00:08:26,941 --> 00:08:28,941
The villages are on the way.

208
00:08:28,941 --> 00:08:31,641
Since many historical buildings

209
00:08:31,641 --> 00:08:33,907
are well-preserved in Krems...

210
00:08:33,907 --> 00:08:38,974
- It's enlisted on UNESCO. / - Really?

211
00:08:40,607 --> 00:08:41,707
It's so beautiful.

212
00:08:41,707 --> 00:08:44,041
Let's go. Let's go.

213
00:08:44,041 --> 00:08:45,674
- That's great camera work. / - The Danube.

214
00:08:49,441 --> 00:08:50,807
It's a boat.

215
00:08:50,807 --> 00:08:52,741
- Should we go buy our tickets? / - Sure.

216
00:08:53,207 --> 00:08:54,707
I think this is where we go in.

217
00:08:54,707 --> 00:08:57,407
The cruise ticket costs $27.

218
00:08:57,974 --> 00:08:59,807
There's a cruise that leaves at 10:10 a.m.

219
00:08:59,807 --> 00:09:02,441
10:10 a.m.? We can get that one.

220
00:09:02,974 --> 00:09:04,674
I really wanted to try this.

221
00:09:06,141 --> 00:09:07,774
We're in Krems.

222
00:09:07,774 --> 00:09:08,774
(Hopping)

223
00:09:10,041 --> 00:09:11,174
Let's go, let's go.

224
00:09:12,841 --> 00:09:15,241
I think there's a restaurant on the cruise.

225
00:09:15,241 --> 00:09:16,407
Really?

226
00:09:16,407 --> 00:09:18,207
Doesn't that look like a restaurant?

227
00:09:21,274 --> 00:09:23,307
This place is so nice.

228
00:09:24,141 --> 00:09:25,441
(Wow)

229
00:09:26,807 --> 00:09:33,141
(Round ticket from Krems to Spitz, $53.80)

230
00:09:35,974 --> 00:09:40,341
(The view calls for a song)

231
00:09:42,207 --> 00:09:44,707
(Her sweet voice goes well with the scenery)

232
00:09:46,107 --> 00:09:47,941
- It looks peaceful. / - Right?

233
00:09:47,941 --> 00:09:51,507
- Austria looks peaceful. I agree. / - I agree.

234
00:09:52,207 --> 00:09:54,807
I wonder how long this river is.

235
00:09:54,807 --> 00:09:58,007
I think the river runs for about 3,000km.

236
00:09:58,007 --> 00:10:00,107
3,000km? That's huge.

237
00:10:00,107 --> 00:10:03,474
It starts from Germany and ends in Ukraine.

238
00:10:03,474 --> 00:10:04,774
- It's connected all the way there? / - Yes.

239
00:10:04,774 --> 00:10:06,541
That's how long it is.

240
00:10:06,541 --> 00:10:09,707
Many people know it as Donau, its German name.

241
00:10:09,707 --> 00:10:12,707
- In English, it's called the Danube. / - The Danube?

242
00:10:12,707 --> 00:10:14,974
- In Czech, it's called Dunaj. / - Dunaj?

243
00:10:14,974 --> 00:10:16,541
- The names are all different. / - Yes.

244
00:10:16,541 --> 00:10:17,307
Since it's so long,

245
00:10:17,307 --> 00:10:20,141
they must've named it differently in different places.

246
00:10:20,441 --> 00:10:23,141
The view from this spot is so nice.

247
00:10:24,074 --> 00:10:25,141
It's so picturesque.

248
00:10:25,141 --> 00:10:25,941
Ladies and gentlemen.

249
00:10:25,941 --> 00:10:28,874
We are now approaching the most famous town.

250
00:10:28,874 --> 00:10:30,274
Famous town.

251
00:10:31,007 --> 00:10:32,041
Wachau.

252
00:10:34,607 --> 00:10:36,641
I think he's explaining about the town.

253
00:10:36,974 --> 00:10:38,107
Is that so?

254
00:10:38,541 --> 00:10:40,174
(You can see the Wachau Cultural Landscape)

255
00:10:40,174 --> 00:10:41,674
(From up close when you pass Durnstein)

256
00:10:43,107 --> 00:10:46,007
Look over there. Do you see the castle over there?

257
00:10:46,341 --> 00:10:47,907
It's over there. Can you see it?

258
00:10:50,574 --> 00:10:55,807
King Richard was held captive in that castle.

259
00:10:55,807 --> 00:10:56,841
Really?

260
00:10:59,174 --> 00:11:01,207
How did they manage to build a castle there?

261
00:11:01,207 --> 00:11:02,874
It hasn't changed.

262
00:11:02,874 --> 00:11:05,607
That means it's really old.

263
00:11:06,541 --> 00:11:07,874
So cool.

264
00:11:08,974 --> 00:11:10,174
We're getting close.

265
00:11:11,174 --> 00:11:13,707
- Durnstein Castle. / - It's so pretty.

266
00:11:15,707 --> 00:11:17,674
This isn't the monastery, right?

267
00:11:18,007 --> 00:11:20,207
- It's really pretty. / - Aren't the colors beautiful?

268
00:11:20,207 --> 00:11:21,974
When we were facing it, the colors were beautiful.

269
00:11:21,974 --> 00:11:23,007
- Right. / - Seriously.

270
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:25,074
The footage doesn't do the justice. In person...

271
00:11:25,074 --> 00:11:26,974
- The colors looked so pretty. / - Hey.

272
00:11:26,974 --> 00:11:27,974
Look at that.

273
00:11:27,974 --> 00:11:28,974
(They move onto the next town)

274
00:11:29,607 --> 00:11:31,007
This is wonderful.

275
00:11:31,707 --> 00:11:34,041
Wendy, how long does it take...

276
00:11:34,041 --> 00:11:37,474
- To Spitz on the cruise? / - 1 hour and 30 minutes.

277
00:11:37,474 --> 00:11:39,441
- You can take your time with it. / - Yes.

278
00:11:39,441 --> 00:11:41,341
Every corer was so pretty.

279
00:11:41,574 --> 00:11:43,607
This town is called Spitz.

280
00:11:43,607 --> 00:11:45,074
- Spitz? / - Yes.

281
00:11:45,074 --> 00:11:46,574
Doesn't it look cute?

282
00:11:47,441 --> 00:11:49,407
I can see the fields right away.

283
00:11:49,407 --> 00:11:51,841
Right? The houses are so pretty.

284
00:11:51,841 --> 00:11:53,407
(The scenery that reminds them of a fairy tale)

285
00:11:54,074 --> 00:11:55,707
I love the sound of birds chirping.

286
00:11:55,707 --> 00:11:56,941
Listen to the chirping.

287
00:11:57,707 --> 00:11:58,907
What will we do now?

288
00:11:58,907 --> 00:12:02,574
We should look around this town since we're here.

289
00:12:02,574 --> 00:12:05,841
- That's why we'll rent bicycles. / - Bicycles?

290
00:12:07,741 --> 00:12:11,107
(Bicycle rental in Spitz, $32 per day)

291
00:12:13,107 --> 00:12:14,107
Is that it?

292
00:12:14,974 --> 00:12:16,207
Segway...

293
00:12:16,907 --> 00:12:18,107
We're not riding that, right?

294
00:12:18,107 --> 00:12:20,607
- That's not a bike. / - I want to ride that.

295
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:21,874
I want to try that too.

296
00:12:22,307 --> 00:12:24,441
It'd be nice to try it out since you're on a trip.

297
00:12:24,441 --> 00:12:26,074
- That was sudden. / - Hey.

298
00:12:26,941 --> 00:12:28,907
(Zoom)

299
00:12:30,607 --> 00:12:32,874
Seulgi, you look so cool.

300
00:12:32,874 --> 00:12:33,874
Let's go.

301
00:12:33,874 --> 00:12:35,174
(Why is Wendy envious of Seulgi?)

302
00:12:35,874 --> 00:12:38,241
I didn't know I would fall like that.

303
00:12:38,241 --> 00:12:40,541
- I wanted to ride a bicycle. / - You can't ride it?

304
00:12:40,541 --> 00:12:42,474
I don't know how to ride bikes.

305
00:12:42,474 --> 00:12:43,507
- Really? / - Yes.

306
00:12:43,507 --> 00:12:45,074
Then did you ride it after learning how?

307
00:12:45,074 --> 00:12:49,141
- Yes. / - The rental shop gave me a basic lesson.

308
00:12:50,574 --> 00:12:51,641
You look cute.

309
00:12:51,841 --> 00:12:53,841
My eyebrows are pushed down.

310
00:12:56,441 --> 00:12:58,041
Hey, you look a bit angry now.

311
00:12:58,041 --> 00:13:00,274
Her eyes have been drawn together.

312
00:13:01,807 --> 00:13:02,507
Let's go.

313
00:13:02,507 --> 00:13:04,107
(They finally set out)

314
00:13:07,541 --> 00:13:09,607
You're pretty good.

315
00:13:09,874 --> 00:13:11,574
♪Ring, ring ♪

316
00:13:11,574 --> 00:13:14,174
Hey, this is great. This feels so relaxing.

317
00:13:14,174 --> 00:13:16,241
??Out of my way please ??

318
00:13:16,841 --> 00:13:19,174
Since this is an electric bicycle,

319
00:13:19,174 --> 00:13:20,807
it doesn't require a lot of energy.

320
00:13:20,807 --> 00:13:22,741
- That's right. It's electric. / - That was electric?

321
00:13:22,741 --> 00:13:24,307
- Yes. / - This is beautiful.

322
00:13:25,441 --> 00:13:28,274
- This is so nice. / - Why is that house so pretty?

323
00:13:33,107 --> 00:13:35,007
Hey, aren't these houses so beautiful?

324
00:13:35,307 --> 00:13:36,341
What's that?

325
00:13:37,041 --> 00:13:38,674
That flower is beautiful.

326
00:13:40,141 --> 00:13:42,007
That doesn't look like a house.

327
00:13:43,074 --> 00:13:45,574
I feel like I'm in a fairy tale. A world in a fairy tale.

328
00:13:45,574 --> 00:13:49,041
There are a lot of pretty flowers here.

329
00:13:51,041 --> 00:13:54,041
(When they pass through the hill between the houses)

330
00:13:56,707 --> 00:13:58,874
- Gosh, this is nice. / - The town was so pretty.

331
00:13:58,874 --> 00:14:01,207
Wendy is floating like a ghost.

332
00:14:01,207 --> 00:14:03,541
- With a white robe. / - Standing upright.

333
00:14:04,374 --> 00:14:07,341
(A ghost at the vineyard?)

334
00:14:08,741 --> 00:14:10,807
Gosh, she looks so scary.

335
00:14:10,807 --> 00:14:12,374
- This is hilarious. / - Behind her...

336
00:14:12,374 --> 00:14:14,341
The downhill is slightly scary.

337
00:14:14,407 --> 00:14:16,041
She's a ghost.

338
00:14:16,541 --> 00:14:17,541
She does look like a ghost.

339
00:14:17,541 --> 00:14:19,441
Please film her whole body.

340
00:14:19,441 --> 00:14:21,041
- You only filmed her upper body. / - This is nice.

341
00:14:21,041 --> 00:14:23,107
- She's chasing her. / - She keeps following.

342
00:14:23,507 --> 00:14:24,841
- I love how fresh the air is. / - She's the ghost.

343
00:14:25,341 --> 00:14:26,441
I've never seen anyone...

344
00:14:26,441 --> 00:14:28,074
- Create laughs with a Segway. / - So funny.

345
00:14:28,641 --> 00:14:30,741
(Currently, they're on an uphill at the vineyard)

346
00:14:31,507 --> 00:14:34,707
- You're following me, right? / - Yes.

347
00:14:35,707 --> 00:14:37,707
- My legs are getting tired. / - Look at her face.

348
00:14:37,707 --> 00:14:39,174
- That bicycle... / - She looks totally exhausted.

349
00:14:39,174 --> 00:14:42,807
I'm not good at riding a bicycle.

350
00:14:42,807 --> 00:14:45,107
- Her legs are giving way. / - I love the smell here.

351
00:14:46,541 --> 00:14:49,441
I'm tired. I'm so exhausted.

352
00:14:50,507 --> 00:14:51,541
(Argh)

353
00:14:52,241 --> 00:14:53,941
(You said it was easy earlier)

354
00:14:55,274 --> 00:14:57,107
(In the midst of her struggle on the uphill)

355
00:14:57,107 --> 00:14:59,641
- Are you keeping up? / - Yes.

356
00:15:00,307 --> 00:15:01,941
Am I the only one struggling here?

357
00:15:03,041 --> 00:15:04,641
I'm not tired.

358
00:15:05,307 --> 00:15:06,607
My eyebrows are getting tired.

359
00:15:06,974 --> 00:15:07,941
Her eyebrows are getting tired.

360
00:15:07,941 --> 00:15:09,141
They've come down too much.

361
00:15:09,141 --> 00:15:09,941
Her eyebrows have sunk.

362
00:15:09,941 --> 00:15:11,874
It must be hard to keep your eyes open.

363
00:15:12,241 --> 00:15:13,507
That's cute.

364
00:15:13,774 --> 00:15:15,707
(At last, it's a downhill)

365
00:15:18,541 --> 00:15:19,541
Come on.

366
00:15:20,241 --> 00:15:21,307
Be careful.

367
00:15:21,307 --> 00:15:25,541
(Wendy successfully climbs down too)

368
00:15:25,974 --> 00:15:27,974
- Great. / - Gosh, that was scary.

369
00:15:27,974 --> 00:15:30,841
- You did well. / - But that was fun.

370
00:15:31,907 --> 00:15:33,774
The colors are beautiful.

371
00:15:35,007 --> 00:15:36,707
This is like a movie set.

372
00:15:36,707 --> 00:15:38,941
(This small town looks like a movie set)

373
00:15:39,441 --> 00:15:41,474
Hey, this part looks so pretty.

374
00:15:41,474 --> 00:15:43,541
Come quickly. Hurry, hurry.

375
00:15:43,541 --> 00:15:46,074
(They want to stop for a moment and look around)

376
00:15:46,074 --> 00:15:47,607
Hey, look at this.

377
00:15:49,107 --> 00:15:51,107
This is like a movie set.

378
00:15:51,107 --> 00:15:53,541
(The scenery turns them into the main characters)

379
00:15:53,874 --> 00:15:54,907
How pretty.

380
00:15:55,507 --> 00:15:58,841
I'm jealous that the residents here get to see this

381
00:15:58,841 --> 00:15:59,974
every day.

382
00:15:59,974 --> 00:16:02,874
- Aren't you getting thirsty? / - I'm thirsty.

383
00:16:02,874 --> 00:16:05,141
- I prepared some drinks. Yes. / - Really?

384
00:16:05,141 --> 00:16:07,141
- What is that? Why is it so big? / - Radler.

385
00:16:07,674 --> 00:16:10,474
Radler means cyclist.

386
00:16:10,474 --> 00:16:11,907
A lot of people here ride bicycles.

387
00:16:11,907 --> 00:16:13,341
- Right. / - It's a light beer.

388
00:16:13,341 --> 00:16:15,941
- It smells like beer. / - People always drink that.

389
00:16:15,941 --> 00:16:17,374
They drink it after biking around.

390
00:16:17,374 --> 00:16:19,674
- They drink it like a beverage? / - Yes.

391
00:16:19,674 --> 00:16:20,607
It quenches your thirst.

392
00:16:20,607 --> 00:16:22,174
It's like mixing lemonade with beer.

393
00:16:23,007 --> 00:16:24,207
- It's lemon beer. / - 2%?

394
00:16:24,207 --> 00:16:26,041
- A light beer with only 2% alcohol. / - It's nice.

395
00:16:27,507 --> 00:16:28,874
- Isn't it refreshing? / - Yes, it is.

396
00:16:29,074 --> 00:16:32,007
And I love the sound of the flowing water.

397
00:16:33,207 --> 00:16:35,507
Everything. Did you hear that?

398
00:16:35,507 --> 00:16:36,974
- Impeccable timing. / - It's 1 o'clock.

399
00:16:37,741 --> 00:16:39,874
The bell is ringing for us.

400
00:16:39,874 --> 00:16:42,407
- It looks like a commercial. / - It looks so beautiful.

401
00:16:42,407 --> 00:16:44,641
- It's a commercial. / - It's a sports drink commercial.

402
00:16:44,641 --> 00:16:47,207
I love the sound of the bell.

403
00:16:47,207 --> 00:16:49,774
- But I'm hungry. / - I was about to say that too.

404
00:16:49,774 --> 00:16:52,074
Let's go and have our lunch.

405
00:16:55,174 --> 00:16:59,141
(Depart from Spitz, arrive in Krems)

406
00:16:59,141 --> 00:17:00,674
Aren't you hungry?

407
00:17:00,974 --> 00:17:03,541
That's why I found a restaurant...

408
00:17:03,541 --> 00:17:06,474
- Where we can eat right away. / - Right away?

409
00:17:06,907 --> 00:17:07,907
- This one? / - Yes.

410
00:17:07,907 --> 00:17:09,541
It was next to the ticket booth.

411
00:17:09,541 --> 00:17:10,407
That's right.

412
00:17:10,407 --> 00:17:12,607
This is a restaurant not that many people know about.

413
00:17:12,941 --> 00:17:15,707
- Really? / - We eat as we watch the Danube.

414
00:17:15,707 --> 00:17:16,474
The location is prime.

415
00:17:16,474 --> 00:17:18,407
We can enjoy the romance

416
00:17:18,407 --> 00:17:19,841
while enjoying a good meal.

417
00:17:20,907 --> 00:17:23,274
- Let's get a glass of beer outside. / - On the terrace.

418
00:17:23,274 --> 00:17:24,907
That's a great shot.

419
00:17:24,907 --> 00:17:26,641
What's that doing there?

420
00:17:26,641 --> 00:17:28,641
- Exactly. / - It was really good.

421
00:17:29,141 --> 00:17:30,507
This is the place, Seulgi.

422
00:17:30,574 --> 00:17:31,807
This is nice.

423
00:17:31,807 --> 00:17:34,274
We'll be eating on the terrace.

424
00:17:34,274 --> 00:17:35,774
With a river view.

425
00:17:36,607 --> 00:17:39,307
- I'm starving. / - Right?

426
00:17:40,174 --> 00:17:41,907
You must eat at a place like that.

427
00:17:41,907 --> 00:17:43,974
- Burger. Vegetarian. / - What's famous here?

428
00:17:43,974 --> 00:17:45,907
- I want to visit there. / - We had this yesterday.

429
00:17:46,807 --> 00:17:48,041
- The short rib soup? / - Yes.

430
00:17:48,241 --> 00:17:50,841
But we've had too much meat.

431
00:17:51,241 --> 00:17:52,974
I want to eat something different.

432
00:17:53,307 --> 00:17:54,541
What is this one?

433
00:17:55,974 --> 00:17:57,074
Sea bream?

434
00:17:57,674 --> 00:17:59,607
Is that some kind of a fish?

435
00:17:59,607 --> 00:18:01,507
- If it is, let's get that. / - Right?

436
00:18:02,207 --> 00:18:03,707
It is fish.

437
00:18:03,707 --> 00:18:05,107
- lt's a blackhead sea bream. / - Blackhead?

438
00:18:05,107 --> 00:18:07,041
- Let's get this one. / - Isn't that expensive in Korea?

439
00:18:07,274 --> 00:18:08,607
The prices are about the same.

440
00:18:08,807 --> 00:18:10,774
- Then we should order this. / - Let's get one of that.

441
00:18:11,041 --> 00:18:13,007
This one. What about this one?

442
00:18:13,374 --> 00:18:15,441
Wachau Breaded Chicken Burger.

443
00:18:15,441 --> 00:18:16,707
It's local bread...

444
00:18:16,707 --> 00:18:18,874
We saw a cathedral on the cruise.

445
00:18:18,874 --> 00:18:20,174
It's made there.

446
00:18:20,174 --> 00:18:22,674
This comes with pumpkin seed mayonnaise.

447
00:18:22,674 --> 00:18:25,041
- Apricots again. / - The mayonnaise sounds good.

448
00:18:25,041 --> 00:18:26,607
- Pumpkin seed mayonnaise? / - That sounds good.

449
00:18:26,607 --> 00:18:27,941
This is apricot jam.

450
00:18:27,941 --> 00:18:30,441
- That's right, they ate apricots then. / - Apricot jam.

451
00:18:30,441 --> 00:18:32,207
Austrians eat a lot of apricots.

452
00:18:32,207 --> 00:18:33,741
Really?

453
00:18:33,741 --> 00:18:35,007
This is so good.

454
00:18:35,007 --> 00:18:36,907
They add apricots in many dishes. I saw this earlier...

455
00:18:36,907 --> 00:18:39,707
- There's an apricot festival. / - Really?

456
00:18:39,907 --> 00:18:41,541
Let's get that.

457
00:18:41,541 --> 00:18:42,741
And the one from earlier.

458
00:18:43,174 --> 00:18:44,474
We should get a glass of beer.

459
00:18:46,007 --> 00:18:49,274
What is this?

460
00:18:49,274 --> 00:18:50,474
Here you are.

461
00:18:50,841 --> 00:18:51,741
Does the head normally looks like this?

462
00:18:51,741 --> 00:18:53,107
How can it look so pretty?

463
00:18:53,107 --> 00:18:55,107
- Is it cream? / - You can tell it's good from the glass.

464
00:18:55,107 --> 00:18:57,141
- What is this? How? / - I learned to enjoy beer...

465
00:18:57,141 --> 00:18:58,674
- After drinking that. / - You need to gulp that down.

466
00:18:58,674 --> 00:18:59,641
Check out the bubbles.

467
00:18:59,641 --> 00:19:01,241
(A sip of draft beer feels cooler on a hot summer day)

468
00:19:01,507 --> 00:19:03,607
- Amazing. / - Cheers.

469
00:19:04,074 --> 00:19:06,641
- Prost. / - Isn't the foam really firm?

470
00:19:07,041 --> 00:19:10,074
(Surprised)

471
00:19:11,441 --> 00:19:13,507
(This is the swag of draft beer)

472
00:19:14,674 --> 00:19:16,341
- What's that? What is it? / - How can that be?

473
00:19:16,341 --> 00:19:17,874
- We just clinked our glasses. / - Is that baking soda?

474
00:19:17,874 --> 00:19:19,074
Is it fake?

475
00:19:19,274 --> 00:19:21,141
- Prost. / - Did someone raise the foam?

476
00:19:21,141 --> 00:19:22,807
- No, no one did that. / - Don't get the wrong idea.

477
00:19:24,441 --> 00:19:27,574
Both of us didn't know how good beer could taste.

478
00:19:27,574 --> 00:19:29,041
- Well... / - That's when we found out.

479
00:19:29,041 --> 00:19:31,841
- You can only taste that there. / - Right.

480
00:19:32,541 --> 00:19:33,874
This is good.

481
00:19:33,874 --> 00:19:35,407
- Does draft beer taste this good? / - Draft beer.

482
00:19:35,407 --> 00:19:37,174
This is how draft beer is supposed to taste like.

483
00:19:37,941 --> 00:19:39,141
It's clean.

484
00:19:39,907 --> 00:19:41,874
It's not that bitter, right?

485
00:19:44,007 --> 00:19:46,007
Some plates to share. Here you are.

486
00:19:46,007 --> 00:19:46,774
Thank you.

487
00:19:46,774 --> 00:19:50,874
I feel like something amazing will be served.

488
00:19:50,874 --> 00:19:52,107
Will a whole sea bream be served?

489
00:19:52,407 --> 00:19:56,741
To share, we have the Mediterranean vegetables.

490
00:19:56,741 --> 00:19:58,341
Even the potatoes look good.

491
00:19:59,041 --> 00:20:01,707
- Enjoy your food. / - Thank you very much.

492
00:20:01,707 --> 00:20:04,207
Hey, I think this will taste great.

493
00:20:04,574 --> 00:20:05,641
At last.

494
00:20:06,441 --> 00:20:08,041
- We'll finally get to eat a fish. / - It's a whole fish.

495
00:20:08,041 --> 00:20:09,674
The sea bream is here.

496
00:20:10,274 --> 00:20:12,507
We can separate it like this.

497
00:20:14,607 --> 00:20:15,807
Can you see this?

498
00:20:16,241 --> 00:20:18,441
- See how milky white this is. / - It's milky white.

499
00:20:19,607 --> 00:20:21,274
This looks really delicious.

500
00:20:21,274 --> 00:20:23,774
- Look at the milky white fish meat. / - It's plump.

501
00:20:24,007 --> 00:20:26,407
But you know how sea bream is expensive in Korea...

502
00:20:26,407 --> 00:20:28,541
Try it. Hurry up and try this.

503
00:20:28,541 --> 00:20:30,041
- It's expensive in Korea. / - Yes.

504
00:20:30,174 --> 00:20:32,807
I didn't know they'd serve us a whole fish.

505
00:20:32,807 --> 00:20:34,707
The grilled sea bream was $22.

506
00:20:34,707 --> 00:20:36,074
- But it's huge. / - $22?

507
00:20:36,074 --> 00:20:38,874
We only have sea bream raw...

508
00:20:38,874 --> 00:20:40,274
- Because it's expensive. / - Right.

509
00:20:40,274 --> 00:20:43,241
But steamed or grilled sea bream is really delicious.

510
00:20:43,241 --> 00:20:44,707
- It was really good. / - I didn't know.

511
00:20:45,841 --> 00:20:46,874
It's so good.

512
00:20:47,941 --> 00:20:49,407
It's not fishy. It's tender.

513
00:20:49,407 --> 00:20:51,207
- That looks amazing. / - It was so tender.

514
00:20:51,207 --> 00:20:53,707
- White rice goes well with that. / - White rice?

515
00:20:53,707 --> 00:20:56,607
It's not fishy at all. It's very tender.

516
00:20:56,974 --> 00:20:59,341
To be honest, food from overseas might be a bit salty.

517
00:20:59,974 --> 00:21:02,241
- It's not salty. / - Yes. Isn't it perfectly seasoned?

518
00:21:02,241 --> 00:21:05,641
They put something on top. What could this be?

519
00:21:06,141 --> 00:21:08,107
- It's like the spinach from yesterday. / - Right.

520
00:21:08,107 --> 00:21:10,874
It taste like thistle and spinach.

521
00:21:10,874 --> 00:21:12,741
That makes the dish fragrant and

522
00:21:12,741 --> 00:21:13,741
enhances the flavors.

523
00:21:16,007 --> 00:21:18,241
We should eat the skin too.

524
00:21:18,807 --> 00:21:20,541
- You like skin. / - I like skin.

525
00:21:20,907 --> 00:21:23,574
- Let's keep eating. / - They finished the whole fish.

526
00:21:24,841 --> 00:21:26,141
Yes, like that.

527
00:21:26,607 --> 00:21:27,807
(Feeling excited)

528
00:21:27,807 --> 00:21:29,441
- That's a waste. / - It must've been really good.

529
00:21:29,441 --> 00:21:30,941
- I'll hold this. / - It was really good.

530
00:21:31,407 --> 00:21:32,974
We can't let even a piece go to waste.

531
00:21:32,974 --> 00:21:35,841
- They thoroughly finished it. / - If only they had rice.

532
00:21:35,841 --> 00:21:37,774
- Honggi keeps asking for white rice. / - Yes.

533
00:21:38,674 --> 00:21:40,374
Hey, we have to eat this too.

534
00:21:40,374 --> 00:21:42,041
- You had the burger too. / - Yes.

535
00:21:42,107 --> 00:21:44,807
But the fish is so good.

536
00:21:44,907 --> 00:21:47,141
- Let's try a bit of this too. / - Sure.

537
00:21:47,141 --> 00:21:47,874
That looks delicious.

538
00:21:47,874 --> 00:21:49,307
They added apricot jam in it.

539
00:21:49,307 --> 00:21:50,974
- It's fried chicken Honggi likes. / - But the apricot...

540
00:21:50,974 --> 00:21:53,674
- A chicken burger. / - That burger looks really tasty.

541
00:21:53,674 --> 00:21:56,207
They added apricots in it. Isn't this apricot?

542
00:21:56,207 --> 00:21:57,307
Try it.

543
00:22:00,607 --> 00:22:02,474
- It's served with the burger. / - Wasn't it good?

544
00:22:02,774 --> 00:22:05,641
Yesterday, when we had the meat dish,

545
00:22:05,641 --> 00:22:07,941
we ate it with ground apples and radishes.

546
00:22:07,941 --> 00:22:09,041
It was refreshing.

547
00:22:09,041 --> 00:22:11,374
And we had the raspberry sauce with schnitzel,

548
00:22:11,374 --> 00:22:12,441
it was refreshing.

549
00:22:12,974 --> 00:22:14,507
Wouldn't this be somewhat similar?

550
00:22:14,507 --> 00:22:16,574
Fried chicken is tasty everywhere.

551
00:22:17,207 --> 00:22:19,341
Look at this. Can you see it?

552
00:22:19,874 --> 00:22:21,274
(So filling)

553
00:22:21,274 --> 00:22:22,574
Homemade bun.

554
00:22:22,574 --> 00:22:23,741
I'm going to try it.

555
00:22:28,541 --> 00:22:30,041
You should've squeezed it.

556
00:22:30,041 --> 00:22:31,541
- It was too big. / - I couldn't. It was too big.

557
00:22:31,541 --> 00:22:33,007
I couldn't press it.

558
00:22:33,007 --> 00:22:35,941
- Press it. Press it hard. / - Don't get all riled up.

559
00:22:35,941 --> 00:22:38,007
- Bite it as you suck in the air. / - Like that?

560
00:22:40,374 --> 00:22:42,841
It's really unique with the apricot jam.

561
00:22:44,841 --> 00:22:46,407
- It's good. / - That must be...

562
00:22:46,407 --> 00:22:47,807
The pumpkin seed mayonnaise.

563
00:22:48,541 --> 00:22:49,441
It's huge.

564
00:22:49,441 --> 00:22:50,907
- I can taste it. / - The pumpkin seed mayonnaise.

565
00:22:51,907 --> 00:22:53,107
If it has mayonnaise in it,

566
00:22:53,107 --> 00:22:54,974
it's game over.

567
00:22:54,974 --> 00:22:56,807
- Watch the roof of your mouth. / - Can't not like it.

568
00:22:56,807 --> 00:22:58,774
You have to try the meat with the apricot.

569
00:23:02,841 --> 00:23:04,974
Isn't it good?

570
00:23:05,574 --> 00:23:08,341
This makes you smile like a mom.

571
00:23:10,007 --> 00:23:12,807
The fried chicken patty is salty. It's well-seasoned.

572
00:23:12,807 --> 00:23:14,574
The apricot is refreshing.

573
00:23:14,774 --> 00:23:17,374
The mix of these two balances out the flavors.

574
00:23:17,374 --> 00:23:19,474
It's sweet and salty at the same time.

575
00:23:19,474 --> 00:23:20,941
- Seriously. / - That's right.

576
00:23:20,941 --> 00:23:21,907
How can the chicken be this good?

577
00:23:21,907 --> 00:23:23,674
Yes, the fried chicken is so good.

578
00:23:24,607 --> 00:23:26,541
(She has another bite of the crispy fried chicken)

579
00:23:26,541 --> 00:23:27,607
No.

580
00:23:28,107 --> 00:23:29,207
Don't spill out.

581
00:23:29,707 --> 00:23:31,074
(Chomp)

582
00:23:31,441 --> 00:23:33,974
(Great reactions even when she eats)

583
00:23:34,441 --> 00:23:37,574
(This needs no words. It's truly delicious)

584
00:23:37,874 --> 00:23:39,407
I'm almost done with mine.

585
00:23:40,141 --> 00:23:41,807
- This is good. / - They eat really well.

586
00:23:41,807 --> 00:23:42,974
- Right? / - Right.

587
00:23:44,341 --> 00:23:45,641
It's the apricot from earlier.

588
00:23:45,641 --> 00:23:47,741
(She finishes the last bite without any hesitation)

589
00:23:49,241 --> 00:23:51,141
(Licking)

590
00:23:53,241 --> 00:23:56,041
- Plus the beer. / - Look at her close her eyes.

591
00:23:57,507 --> 00:24:00,141
The meal tastes better on the terrace.

592
00:24:00,141 --> 00:24:01,707
It's cool too.

593
00:24:02,474 --> 00:24:05,241
(She gulps down her draft beer too)

594
00:24:06,441 --> 00:24:07,641
Wasn't it good?

595
00:24:08,307 --> 00:24:09,341
- Yes. / - Wasn't it tasty?

596
00:24:09,341 --> 00:24:12,441
Earlier, you seemed to really like this beer.

597
00:24:12,974 --> 00:24:15,374
- So we'll go to a beer factory. / - Really?

598
00:24:18,074 --> 00:24:20,407
There's a famous beer factory in Austria.

599
00:24:21,974 --> 00:24:23,441
- It's a beer factory. / - It's a beer factory.

600
00:24:23,974 --> 00:24:25,107
- That looks good. / - Wow.

601
00:24:25,107 --> 00:24:26,341
- It's the same beer we drank. / - That's awesome.

602
00:24:26,341 --> 00:24:28,174
- How does Austrian beer taste? / - It's that beer.

603
00:24:29,207 --> 00:24:32,374
(The charm of Austrian beer we didn't know about)

604
00:24:33,041 --> 00:24:35,007
How is it? Is it good?

605
00:24:35,507 --> 00:24:37,407
- It's so good. / - It tasted so...

606
00:24:38,074 --> 00:24:40,207
- Was it amazing? / - It was different.

607
00:24:41,174 --> 00:24:46,841
(21 minutes from Krems Station by shuttle bus)

608
00:24:47,274 --> 00:24:51,741
We have arrived at the beer factory. We're here.

609
00:24:52,174 --> 00:24:53,774
A beer factory.

610
00:24:53,774 --> 00:24:54,974
- My first time. / - Isn't this your first time?

611
00:24:54,974 --> 00:24:56,174
It's my first time too.

612
00:24:56,174 --> 00:25:00,807
Will we be able to watch the process of making beer?

613
00:25:00,807 --> 00:25:01,807
Yes.

614
00:25:01,807 --> 00:25:02,841
We'll be able to taste it too.

615
00:25:03,307 --> 00:25:04,441
Taste it too.

616
00:25:04,774 --> 00:25:06,074
- Is this right? / - By the way...

617
00:25:06,074 --> 00:25:08,007
??Taste, chew, enjoy ??What was it?

618
00:25:08,107 --> 00:25:09,607
It's "Eat, chew, taste, enjoy."

619
00:25:09,607 --> 00:25:10,774
- Are you going to be like this? / - "Eat, chew..."

620
00:25:10,774 --> 00:25:11,774
"Taste, enjoy?"

621
00:25:12,041 --> 00:25:13,241
Can you do it with me?

622
00:25:13,474 --> 00:25:14,541
2, 3, 4.

623
00:25:14,541 --> 00:25:17,974
??Eat, chew, taste, enjoy ??

624
00:25:18,174 --> 00:25:19,574
(It's embarrassing)

625
00:25:20,141 --> 00:25:22,207
(She's immersed)

626
00:25:22,907 --> 00:25:23,974
You're good.

627
00:25:24,641 --> 00:25:25,941
It's this way.

628
00:25:25,941 --> 00:25:27,474
Is this the entrance?

629
00:25:28,241 --> 00:25:29,741
Let me escort you.

630
00:25:33,374 --> 00:25:35,174
Welcome to our brewery.

631
00:25:35,174 --> 00:25:36,341
Before we enter,

632
00:25:36,341 --> 00:25:38,707
we kindly ask you to wear our safety vests.

633
00:25:38,707 --> 00:25:40,107
- Okay. / - Ah, yeah.

634
00:25:40,107 --> 00:25:41,441
(They put on safety vests to be spotted easily)

635
00:25:41,441 --> 00:25:43,341
I like the color.

636
00:25:43,341 --> 00:25:44,841
She likes the vest.

637
00:25:45,141 --> 00:25:46,807
So, let's go upstairs.

638
00:25:46,807 --> 00:25:47,841
Yes. Okay.

639
00:25:47,841 --> 00:25:49,274
(They take off to have a tour around the factory)

640
00:25:50,741 --> 00:25:52,474
(When you go up the stairs)

641
00:25:54,407 --> 00:25:55,707
It's pretty hot.

642
00:25:56,541 --> 00:25:57,641
It was really hot.

643
00:25:57,941 --> 00:25:59,074
- Like a sauna. / - Why is it hot?

644
00:25:59,474 --> 00:26:01,107
(It's the beginning of the beer making process)

645
00:26:01,107 --> 00:26:02,274
- What? / - Because of the fermentation.

646
00:26:02,274 --> 00:26:05,341
They ferment the raw ingredients at over 100??

647
00:26:05,341 --> 00:26:07,741
- They ferment it here. / - Yes.

648
00:26:07,741 --> 00:26:09,041
They do that here.

649
00:26:10,141 --> 00:26:11,507
There's a certain law in Europe

650
00:26:11,507 --> 00:26:12,974
that regulates people to use only malt,

651
00:26:12,974 --> 00:26:14,874
hops and water to make beer.

652
00:26:14,874 --> 00:26:16,474
Add something else, and it can't be called beer.

653
00:26:17,507 --> 00:26:18,241
What's that?

654
00:26:18,241 --> 00:26:19,974
Hop in a crusher.

655
00:26:19,974 --> 00:26:20,874
Crusher?

656
00:26:20,874 --> 00:26:22,474
It's ground hops.

657
00:26:23,274 --> 00:26:26,274
They mix the ground ingredients with water

658
00:26:26,274 --> 00:26:28,274
and boil it in heat.

659
00:26:28,274 --> 00:26:32,007
Then they use the one next to filter it.

660
00:26:32,007 --> 00:26:34,874
They add the hops and boil it again.

661
00:26:34,874 --> 00:26:36,141
Then they filter it again.

662
00:26:36,141 --> 00:26:38,607
And the state it's in just before completion...

663
00:26:38,607 --> 00:26:41,207
Which we call original wort.

664
00:26:41,207 --> 00:26:43,607
It's called wort. They call it beer wort.

665
00:26:43,607 --> 00:26:47,107
Next step is that we want to have alcohol.

666
00:26:47,107 --> 00:26:50,307
- So we start the fermentation. / - Fermentation, okay.

667
00:26:51,374 --> 00:26:53,707
(They pour some beer right after fermentation)

668
00:26:55,341 --> 00:26:58,341
(The fresh taste will be revealed soon)

669
00:26:59,474 --> 00:27:00,907
(What's the next spot?)

670
00:27:01,807 --> 00:27:03,507
(Her jaw drops)

671
00:27:03,507 --> 00:27:04,674
I smell the beer.

672
00:27:04,674 --> 00:27:06,741
- Is this the smell of the beer? / - Beer, yeah.

673
00:27:07,907 --> 00:27:10,274
I've never seen a factory up close like this.

674
00:27:11,307 --> 00:27:13,541
(They can see the process of packaging beer)

675
00:27:13,541 --> 00:27:15,241
- I can smell the beer. / - It's no joke.

676
00:27:15,641 --> 00:27:17,007
(Amazed)

677
00:27:17,341 --> 00:27:19,241
- Is that the one? / - Canned beer.

678
00:27:19,241 --> 00:27:21,041
The machine can produce

679
00:27:21,041 --> 00:27:23,207
50,000 cans of beer in 1 hour.

680
00:27:23,641 --> 00:27:25,707
- Wow. / - It's really fast.

681
00:27:26,174 --> 00:27:27,541
- Awesome. / - Really fast.

682
00:27:29,174 --> 00:27:31,074
(Next is where the beer gets the final fermentation)

683
00:27:31,241 --> 00:27:32,407
It's cold in here.

684
00:27:32,774 --> 00:27:34,707
(It's freezing)

685
00:27:36,374 --> 00:27:37,374
Now, you'll try it.

686
00:27:37,374 --> 00:27:38,774
Drink beer...

687
00:27:38,774 --> 00:27:40,774
- Directly from the tank. / - It must be delicious.

688
00:27:41,107 --> 00:27:42,307
Is this the tank?

689
00:27:43,274 --> 00:27:45,241
It's where we can taste the beer

690
00:27:45,241 --> 00:27:47,807
directly from the tank.

691
00:27:47,807 --> 00:27:50,407
It's real draft beer.

692
00:27:50,407 --> 00:27:52,674
It's coming out from this tank, right?

693
00:27:53,141 --> 00:27:55,041
He's pouring beer directly.

694
00:27:55,207 --> 00:27:56,641
- Really. / - Wow.

695
00:27:56,641 --> 00:27:58,041
Look at the froth.

696
00:28:00,307 --> 00:28:04,174
- The froth is like whipped cream. / - It contains...

697
00:28:04,174 --> 00:28:06,474
- All kinds of minerals and proteins. / - You ready?

698
00:28:06,474 --> 00:28:08,874
You know all the nutrients.

699
00:28:08,874 --> 00:28:11,107
It's all in here.

700
00:28:11,107 --> 00:28:12,007
Really?

701
00:28:12,007 --> 00:28:14,107
- Look at its color. / - It's murky.

702
00:28:14,107 --> 00:28:15,707
- You're right. / - It's very soft too.

703
00:28:15,707 --> 00:28:17,741
It's murky because everything is inside that beer.

704
00:28:19,007 --> 00:28:21,541
- It's pretty yellow. / - There's a lot of froth.

705
00:28:21,541 --> 00:28:25,007
- As we say in Austria, prost. / - Prost.

706
00:28:25,007 --> 00:28:27,474
- To your house. / - Prost.

707
00:28:27,474 --> 00:28:28,974
(Cheers)

708
00:28:30,007 --> 00:28:31,107
It's really good.

709
00:28:32,007 --> 00:28:35,407
(Gulping)

710
00:28:37,607 --> 00:28:39,574
(Her eyes know the taste of beer)

711
00:28:39,574 --> 00:28:40,807
It's delicious.

712
00:28:41,041 --> 00:28:42,474
(Cheers one more time)

713
00:28:45,507 --> 00:28:49,007
(Beer is going down their throats)

714
00:28:50,707 --> 00:28:52,507
It tastes like I won't get drunk.

715
00:28:53,141 --> 00:28:54,241
You want more?

716
00:28:55,641 --> 00:28:56,974
Just a bit more.

717
00:29:00,441 --> 00:29:03,374
(Seulgi can't lose to her)

718
00:29:05,941 --> 00:29:06,974
You want more too?

719
00:29:08,174 --> 00:29:09,674
(Yes, please)

720
00:29:09,874 --> 00:29:11,341
It's delicious even if I keep drinking.

721
00:29:11,341 --> 00:29:14,107
(Brewery tour, $12.30 for 2 glasses of beer and a bread)

722
00:29:14,107 --> 00:29:16,541
(It's open for tours 3 times a week)

723
00:29:16,541 --> 00:29:18,607
(More details are written on the website)

724
00:29:20,574 --> 00:29:21,807
(Exclaiming together)

725
00:29:21,874 --> 00:29:24,841
Drinking it directly out of the tank...

726
00:29:24,841 --> 00:29:27,274
It doesn't taste like beer I used to know.

727
00:29:27,641 --> 00:29:28,874
It's really good.

728
00:29:28,874 --> 00:29:31,374
It was sparkling.

729
00:29:31,574 --> 00:29:33,974
- It was amazing. / - I bet it's delicious.

730
00:29:33,974 --> 00:29:37,841
- Its taste depends on distribution. / - I see.

731
00:29:38,641 --> 00:29:41,007
I think I should drink beer at a beer factory from now.

732
00:29:41,874 --> 00:29:43,274
There isn't any beer factory in our country.

733
00:29:44,074 --> 00:29:46,374
People can go on a tour around the factory like that?

734
00:29:46,374 --> 00:29:48,841
- They can make a reservation... / - So they can.

735
00:29:48,841 --> 00:29:50,841
Through the website.

736
00:29:50,841 --> 00:29:52,774
- You need prior reservations. / - Right.

737
00:29:53,007 --> 00:29:55,074
Shall we leave with an excited heart?

738
00:29:55,074 --> 00:29:56,107
Let's clink before we go.

739
00:29:56,174 --> 00:29:57,574
- Wendy. / - Seulgi.

740
00:29:57,574 --> 00:29:59,041
Digidigidip.

741
00:29:59,307 --> 00:30:01,107
- Di. / - Gi.

742
00:30:01,441 --> 00:30:02,807
- Di. / - Gi.

743
00:30:03,641 --> 00:30:04,774
Dip!

744
00:30:06,707 --> 00:30:08,407
Seulgi, let's leave for

745
00:30:08,407 --> 00:30:10,874
the city of music, the hometown of Mozart now.

746
00:30:11,674 --> 00:30:14,174
- Let's go... / - To that place.

747
00:30:14,174 --> 00:30:15,241
Let's go.

748
00:30:16,574 --> 00:30:18,741
(On a train to Salzburg)

749
00:30:19,507 --> 00:30:22,607
A train ticket to Salzburg costs $63.

750
00:30:22,674 --> 00:30:24,407
- It's one-way. / - Okay.

751
00:30:28,474 --> 00:30:31,241
I can't believe we're in Austria.

752
00:30:31,807 --> 00:30:33,041
I just can't believe it.

753
00:30:34,741 --> 00:30:35,707
Now that we're on a train,

754
00:30:35,707 --> 00:30:38,207
I'm reminded of "Before Sunrise."

755
00:30:38,207 --> 00:30:39,474
Their love starts on a train.

756
00:30:39,474 --> 00:30:40,607
I remember that.

757
00:30:42,074 --> 00:30:46,707
(Their coincidental relationship starts on a train)

758
00:30:47,807 --> 00:30:50,274
(It's a romantic love story of European train trips)

759
00:30:50,307 --> 00:30:51,707
I don't know about this movie but

760
00:30:51,707 --> 00:30:52,607
I feel like I should watch it.

761
00:30:52,607 --> 00:30:53,941
I highly recommend it.

762
00:30:54,241 --> 00:30:56,274
Let's say you met a guy

763
00:30:56,274 --> 00:30:59,574
by accident like the movie.

764
00:30:59,574 --> 00:31:01,307
You talked to each other for a short period of time.

765
00:31:01,774 --> 00:31:03,507
Then he suddenly suggests you should get off.

766
00:31:03,674 --> 00:31:04,841
Would you get off then?

767
00:31:06,807 --> 00:31:08,007
Would you get off then?

768
00:31:08,941 --> 00:31:10,441
I think I would.

769
00:31:10,974 --> 00:31:14,041
If I was really attracted to that guy.

770
00:31:14,374 --> 00:31:16,107
I think it'd be too short of a time

771
00:31:16,107 --> 00:31:17,441
to get to know each other.

772
00:31:17,441 --> 00:31:18,641
- I wouldn't get off. / - But what if...

773
00:31:18,641 --> 00:31:21,307
What if you two were so compatible?

774
00:31:21,974 --> 00:31:23,907
What if you guys got along so well?

775
00:31:24,341 --> 00:31:26,207
I might make a plan to see him.

776
00:31:26,207 --> 00:31:28,174
- Oh, later? / - Yes.

777
00:31:28,174 --> 00:31:30,641
I think I'm a bit spontaneous.

778
00:31:32,907 --> 00:31:36,041
We're heading to Salzburg right now.

779
00:31:36,807 --> 00:31:37,941
What are our plans there?

780
00:31:38,507 --> 00:31:39,541
Our plans?

781
00:31:40,674 --> 00:31:42,074
(They soak deeply into the city of music)

782
00:31:42,074 --> 00:31:43,874
Wow, it's so pretty here.

783
00:31:45,941 --> 00:31:47,407
- It looks delicious. / - What's that?

784
00:31:47,407 --> 00:31:48,907
It looks really tasty.

785
00:31:48,907 --> 00:31:50,474
I'm so happy. What do I do?

786
00:31:50,474 --> 00:31:52,307
I love just walking here.

787
00:31:52,307 --> 00:31:54,341
I'm reminded of the scenes in the movie.

788
00:31:54,341 --> 00:31:57,807
These are the places in "The Sound of Music."

789
00:31:57,807 --> 00:31:59,641
Everything here is just perfect.

790
00:32:01,074 --> 00:32:03,907
The world seems even more beautiful.

791
00:32:05,874 --> 00:32:09,574
(They fly in the sky of Salzburg and Alps)

792
00:32:09,574 --> 00:32:11,507
We're flying.

793
00:32:13,274 --> 00:32:14,807
(Wendy's Day in Salzburg)

794
00:32:14,807 --> 00:32:17,541
(Salzburg)

795
00:32:17,541 --> 00:32:20,207
(Tasting Austrian dessert)

796
00:32:20,207 --> 00:32:22,907
- We arrived in Salzburg. / - Right.

797
00:32:23,107 --> 00:32:24,941
What is there that we like?

798
00:32:24,941 --> 00:32:26,707
Aside from sightseeing and shopping?

799
00:32:26,707 --> 00:32:28,874
- Of course, eating. / - Right?

800
00:32:28,874 --> 00:32:30,107
There's something...

801
00:32:30,107 --> 00:32:31,974
- We must try in Austria. / - What is it?

802
00:32:31,974 --> 00:32:34,574
It's the must-try dessert

803
00:32:34,574 --> 00:32:36,007
and the must-try coffee.

804
00:32:37,574 --> 00:32:39,374
- It's Sachertorte. / - You know that?

805
00:32:39,374 --> 00:32:42,341
- Is it famous? / - It's also sold...

806
00:32:42,341 --> 00:32:44,774
At Hotel Sacher in Vienna.

807
00:32:44,774 --> 00:32:46,041
It's really famous.

808
00:32:46,041 --> 00:32:49,141
- What's that? / - Is that cake?

809
00:32:49,141 --> 00:32:51,907
It's only sold in Salzburg.

810
00:32:51,907 --> 00:32:53,774
- It's only sold in Salzburg? / - Yes.

811
00:32:53,774 --> 00:32:55,974
It only exists in this region.

812
00:32:55,974 --> 00:32:57,974
It was so rare in the past.

813
00:32:57,974 --> 00:33:00,941
Only noble people could have the chance to eat it.

814
00:33:00,941 --> 00:33:02,807
- Are you ready? / - I am.

815
00:33:02,807 --> 00:33:04,307
Let's walk in like sophisticated ladies.

816
00:33:04,307 --> 00:33:05,741
- Like noble ladies. / - Okay.

817
00:33:06,107 --> 00:33:07,941
- Hello. / - Hello.

818
00:33:09,074 --> 00:33:10,341
Didn't you say there are only two...

819
00:33:10,341 --> 00:33:11,674
- Of this cafe in the country? / - Yes.

820
00:33:12,641 --> 00:33:15,974
A lot of global celebrities visited this place too.

821
00:33:16,641 --> 00:33:17,841
It is this place.

822
00:33:18,307 --> 00:33:22,441
It's the evidence that many celebrities visited here.

823
00:33:23,574 --> 00:33:25,907
There's the name on the picture. Hugh Grant.

824
00:33:26,441 --> 00:33:28,441
- They recorded all the celebrities. / - Hugh Grant.

825
00:33:28,441 --> 00:33:28,874
Yes.

826
00:33:28,874 --> 00:33:30,974
- All the celebrities visited there. / - Cameron Diaz.

827
00:33:30,974 --> 00:33:32,441
There's a picture of Tom Hanks too.

828
00:33:33,574 --> 00:33:34,574
- Tom Hanks. / - He looks young in the picture.

829
00:33:34,574 --> 00:33:36,374
She's Maria.

830
00:33:37,874 --> 00:33:42,174
- Heroine of "The Sound of Music." / - That's right.

831
00:33:42,174 --> 00:33:44,307
- ??Do, re, mi ??/ - Seriously.

832
00:33:44,307 --> 00:33:45,907
I really want to hear that.

833
00:33:46,774 --> 00:33:49,007
This place used to serve to the royal family.

834
00:33:49,274 --> 00:33:51,441
Right, I heard that too.

835
00:33:52,307 --> 00:33:54,974
It seems like an art museum.

836
00:33:55,574 --> 00:33:57,074
Right, museum.

837
00:33:57,074 --> 00:33:59,674
The interior of this place

838
00:33:59,674 --> 00:34:03,941
makes me feel like I'm really in Europe.

839
00:34:03,941 --> 00:34:06,374
I can sense the old European-style in the interior.

840
00:34:07,074 --> 00:34:08,774
It must have a really long history.

841
00:34:08,774 --> 00:34:11,541
(Its antique beauty from 150 years of history)

842
00:34:11,541 --> 00:34:13,841
Places in Austria have 200 to 300 years of history.

843
00:34:13,841 --> 00:34:15,207
100 to 200 years at least.

844
00:34:16,741 --> 00:34:18,841
Our first dessert...

845
00:34:18,841 --> 00:34:20,774
- Is called Nockerl. / - Nockerl?

846
00:34:20,774 --> 00:34:23,507
You can't find this dessert anywhere else but here.

847
00:34:23,507 --> 00:34:25,107
- It's sold only in Salzburg? / - Right.

848
00:34:25,107 --> 00:34:28,541
The meringue symbolizes the three mountain peaks

849
00:34:28,541 --> 00:34:30,307
surrounding the city.

850
00:34:30,307 --> 00:34:32,274
- The dessert looks like mountains? / - Right.

851
00:34:32,807 --> 00:34:34,707
(It has the shape of 3 mountain peaks)

852
00:34:35,041 --> 00:34:36,507
- It looks so good. / - Did they make the meringue...

853
00:34:36,507 --> 00:34:37,974
And torch it?

854
00:34:37,974 --> 00:34:39,074
- A little. / - They torched...

855
00:34:39,074 --> 00:34:40,641
- The top part. / - Right?

856
00:34:40,641 --> 00:34:41,941
It's served with jam.

857
00:34:41,941 --> 00:34:43,707
(Nockerl, $25)

858
00:34:43,707 --> 00:34:44,807
It looks delicious.

859
00:34:45,941 --> 00:34:48,874
(It makes the girls excited)

860
00:34:50,174 --> 00:34:51,874
It looks so pretty.

861
00:34:51,874 --> 00:34:53,107
That's one huge dessert.

862
00:34:53,107 --> 00:34:54,774
- It looks good. / - They serve it for you.

863
00:34:56,707 --> 00:34:58,541
It's so soft.

864
00:34:58,541 --> 00:34:59,741
She serves it like that.

865
00:34:59,741 --> 00:35:01,507
- It's a bit like... / - I'd like to put it in my mouth.

866
00:35:01,507 --> 00:35:02,741
It's like cheese cake.

867
00:35:02,741 --> 00:35:04,041
- Do you have a sweet tooth? / - Yes, I do.

868
00:35:04,041 --> 00:35:05,941
It'll melt away in your mouth.

869
00:35:08,341 --> 00:35:10,907
(She scoops some strawberry cream as well)

870
00:35:10,907 --> 00:35:12,974
It looks like you eat them together.

871
00:35:14,041 --> 00:35:15,607
I forgot to take a picture of it.

872
00:35:16,374 --> 00:35:18,274
- Thank you. / - Thank you.

873
00:35:18,274 --> 00:35:19,307
Enjoy.

874
00:35:19,307 --> 00:35:20,441
(Wow)

875
00:35:20,941 --> 00:35:23,407
It's hard to make meringue like this.

876
00:35:23,407 --> 00:35:24,274
Really hard.

877
00:35:24,274 --> 00:35:25,474
I've always wanted to do this.

878
00:35:25,474 --> 00:35:27,141
Seriously, it's hard to make meringue like this.

879
00:35:27,141 --> 00:35:28,474
It looks like a baby's bottom.

880
00:35:29,174 --> 00:35:30,841
It's so hard to make meringue like this.

881
00:35:32,374 --> 00:35:33,607
Did you hear that?

882
00:35:33,607 --> 00:35:35,674
Did you hear the sound of the meringue?

883
00:35:35,674 --> 00:35:37,574
I want to record the sound.

884
00:35:41,441 --> 00:35:42,974
- It's amazing, isn't it? / - I heard it.

885
00:35:42,974 --> 00:35:44,907
- Good job, me. / - Well done.

886
00:35:44,907 --> 00:35:47,074
- I heard it. / - Good job, Wendy.

887
00:35:48,241 --> 00:35:49,941
(Here it goes again)

888
00:35:49,941 --> 00:35:53,307
It smells like a tasty pancake.

889
00:35:53,307 --> 00:35:55,741
It does. I smell eggs. Let's try.

890
00:35:57,307 --> 00:35:58,741
- I don't know. / - It must melt in your mouth.

891
00:35:58,741 --> 00:36:00,607
- It melts, doesn't it? / - Yes, it melts like foam.

892
00:36:00,607 --> 00:36:02,974
It melts away in my mouth like foam.

893
00:36:04,041 --> 00:36:05,441
- It just melts away. / - When you feel down...

894
00:36:05,441 --> 00:36:07,841
- This will cheer you up. / - I'm sure it will.

895
00:36:08,841 --> 00:36:12,174
It feels like a fluffy pancake

896
00:36:12,174 --> 00:36:14,507
that melts in your mouth.

897
00:36:14,507 --> 00:36:16,107
- There's nothing to chew. / - You're right.

898
00:36:16,107 --> 00:36:17,107
It just melts away.

899
00:36:17,107 --> 00:36:18,574
Do we have something like that in Korea as well?

900
00:36:18,574 --> 00:36:20,341
- No, we don't. / - We don't, right?

901
00:36:21,174 --> 00:36:24,974
I like the outer part.

902
00:36:24,974 --> 00:36:27,474
- The baked part. / - That baked part is...

903
00:36:27,474 --> 00:36:29,241
- It must be delicious. / - It is.

904
00:36:29,241 --> 00:36:31,141
I'll try it with the cream.

905
00:36:33,274 --> 00:36:34,441
That alone can be a bit too rich

906
00:36:34,441 --> 00:36:36,674
but the strawberry cream

907
00:36:36,674 --> 00:36:38,441
makes it taste refreshing.

908
00:36:38,974 --> 00:36:39,974
(Mmm)

909
00:36:40,007 --> 00:36:42,507
I think I get why they eat it with the cream.

910
00:36:43,241 --> 00:36:46,507
Just this alone can be a bit too rich.

911
00:36:47,641 --> 00:36:49,441
But the cream helps with it.

912
00:36:50,774 --> 00:36:52,207
(Their coffee is served)

913
00:36:52,207 --> 00:36:54,241
Yes. I needed coffee.

914
00:36:54,241 --> 00:36:56,007
- This is Einspanner. / - Einspanner.

915
00:36:56,007 --> 00:36:57,274
That's Viennese Coffee.

916
00:36:57,274 --> 00:36:58,941
- Viennese Coffee. / - Exactly.

917
00:36:58,941 --> 00:37:01,807
- This is Melange. / - Melange.

918
00:37:02,541 --> 00:37:05,807
You know how we rode in that carriage?

919
00:37:05,807 --> 00:37:08,074
I heard people used to drink coffee

920
00:37:08,074 --> 00:37:09,807
while riding carriages.

921
00:37:10,607 --> 00:37:11,807
It's shaky on a carriage.

922
00:37:11,807 --> 00:37:13,574
But Einspanner doesn't spill.

923
00:37:13,574 --> 00:37:15,974
- Oh, really? / - Because of the cream on top.

924
00:37:16,974 --> 00:37:21,107
Because the coffee spills on a carriage,

925
00:37:21,107 --> 00:37:23,307
they put cream on top of it.

926
00:37:23,307 --> 00:37:24,574
- The cream keeps it down. / - Yes.

927
00:37:24,574 --> 00:37:27,341
Also, it keeps the coffee warm.

928
00:37:27,341 --> 00:37:29,107
It doesn't spill. What comfort.

929
00:37:30,407 --> 00:37:31,574
Are you talking about a bed or what?

930
00:37:33,174 --> 00:37:34,607
(She's tries the Einspanner)

931
00:37:34,607 --> 00:37:36,307
- Drink it up. / - All you get is the cream.

932
00:37:36,307 --> 00:37:38,774
- You'll only taste the cream. / - That's true.

933
00:37:38,774 --> 00:37:39,874
You have to finish the cream first.

934
00:37:39,874 --> 00:37:42,274
- Then drink the coffee. / - It might go into your nose.

935
00:37:43,741 --> 00:37:44,774
You look so cute.

936
00:37:46,741 --> 00:37:49,407
The coffee doesn't taste that bitter

937
00:37:49,407 --> 00:37:50,707
because of the cream.

938
00:37:51,041 --> 00:37:52,441
(She tries the Melange as well)

939
00:37:54,207 --> 00:37:55,307
This is Melange.

940
00:37:55,307 --> 00:37:56,507
It's delicious.

941
00:37:56,941 --> 00:37:58,941
It's really soft.

942
00:37:59,441 --> 00:38:00,974
It's a bit nutty.

943
00:38:00,974 --> 00:38:02,441
It tastes like Job's tears tea.

944
00:38:03,841 --> 00:38:05,674
- Job's tears tea? / - Job's tears tea?

945
00:38:05,974 --> 00:38:08,407
Suddenly that place looks like a Korean tea room.

946
00:38:08,907 --> 00:38:10,474
It was very nutty.

947
00:38:11,907 --> 00:38:13,441
(Finally, Sachertorte is served)

948
00:38:13,441 --> 00:38:15,541
- Sachertorte. / - Sachertorte.

949
00:38:15,541 --> 00:38:18,307
- Thank you. / - Thank you.

950
00:38:18,307 --> 00:38:21,707
This is the most famous dessert here.

951
00:38:21,707 --> 00:38:24,174
I heard this was a must-try.

952
00:38:24,174 --> 00:38:26,807
Torte means cake.

953
00:38:26,807 --> 00:38:28,441
- Torte means cake? / - Yes.

954
00:38:28,441 --> 00:38:32,107
Back in the old days, sugar was rare.

955
00:38:32,107 --> 00:38:37,007
Chocolate was a delicacy only for the nobles.

956
00:38:37,007 --> 00:38:39,007
It's a fancy cake with apricot jam in it.

957
00:38:39,007 --> 00:38:41,774
- It's a very fancy cake. / - It has apricot jam in it.

958
00:38:41,774 --> 00:38:43,407
- They put apricot jam in there too. / - Always apricots.

959
00:38:43,407 --> 00:38:45,041
Which part should I eat first?

960
00:38:45,041 --> 00:38:46,141
However you like.

961
00:38:46,141 --> 00:38:48,207
They're well-known for apricot jam.

962
00:38:50,041 --> 00:38:51,407
- Is this apricot jam? / - Is this apricot jam?

963
00:38:51,407 --> 00:38:53,374
We just had the same thought.

964
00:38:53,374 --> 00:38:55,007
Is this apricot jam?

965
00:38:55,874 --> 00:38:57,574
Try it. Try it already.

966
00:38:57,574 --> 00:38:59,074
Please try it.

967
00:38:59,074 --> 00:39:00,741
Let me try it without the cream first.

968
00:39:05,674 --> 00:39:07,107
(How does it taste?)

969
00:39:07,807 --> 00:39:09,607
I can taste the apricot jam.

970
00:39:10,307 --> 00:39:15,107
My friend said it tastes like a fancy Vic Pie.

971
00:39:16,307 --> 00:39:17,541
My friend said that.

972
00:39:17,541 --> 00:39:18,574
- A fancy one. / - Vic Pie?

973
00:39:18,574 --> 00:39:20,341
A fancy Vic Pie.

974
00:39:20,707 --> 00:39:21,707
My gosh.

975
00:39:22,307 --> 00:39:24,374
It tastes very rich.

976
00:39:26,241 --> 00:39:28,607
It's good, isn't it? This is delicious.

977
00:39:28,607 --> 00:39:29,441
Is she going to say something else?

978
00:39:29,441 --> 00:39:31,241
Why did she compare this to that?

979
00:39:32,007 --> 00:39:33,774
I can't understand that at all.

980
00:39:33,807 --> 00:39:36,907
My friend said that. Don't you think they taste similar?

981
00:39:36,907 --> 00:39:38,007
Who is this friend?

982
00:39:38,007 --> 00:39:40,341
- Who is this friend? / - Who is it?

983
00:39:41,507 --> 00:39:42,841
I think I need to talk to her.

984
00:39:43,441 --> 00:39:44,441
Why would she compare this to that?

985
00:39:44,874 --> 00:39:47,041
It's really tasty with the cream.

986
00:39:47,407 --> 00:39:49,207
I haven't gone to many restaurants

987
00:39:49,207 --> 00:39:50,841
nor am I a gourmet...

988
00:39:51,407 --> 00:39:54,541
But the chocolate is chewy and soft.

989
00:39:54,541 --> 00:39:57,974
As you see, there is a very thin layer of apricot jam.

990
00:39:57,974 --> 00:39:59,541
- But it tastes so strong. / - How is it possible?

991
00:39:59,541 --> 00:40:01,874
- It's so thin. / - It's so thin.

992
00:40:01,874 --> 00:40:04,241
But it's perfect with the chocolate.

993
00:40:04,807 --> 00:40:07,507
What's important is the combination of

994
00:40:07,507 --> 00:40:09,574
the sweetness and the freshness.

995
00:40:09,574 --> 00:40:12,341
- You're right. / - It's moderately fresh...

996
00:40:12,341 --> 00:40:14,441
- And moderately sweet. / - And moderately sweet.

997
00:40:14,441 --> 00:40:17,041
When the balance collapses,

998
00:40:17,041 --> 00:40:18,574
it will taste like nothing.

999
00:40:18,574 --> 00:40:19,474
She sounds like an expert.

1000
00:40:19,474 --> 00:40:21,041
You sound like a gourmet.

1001
00:40:21,541 --> 00:40:22,541
(Proud)

1002
00:40:25,541 --> 00:40:28,541
(She takes a sip of coffee after eating the cake)

1003
00:40:30,741 --> 00:40:32,974
They taste perfect together.

1004
00:40:33,374 --> 00:40:37,307
They enhance each other's flavor.

1005
00:40:38,207 --> 00:40:40,941
- You really like sweets. / - It's made of raspberry...

1006
00:40:40,941 --> 00:40:43,141
Normally, Seulgi and I...

1007
00:40:43,141 --> 00:40:45,241
- Don't eat a lot of dessert. / - We don't eat desserts.

1008
00:40:45,241 --> 00:40:47,341
We don't like cakes and don't eat them often.

1009
00:40:47,341 --> 00:40:50,641
That's the first time I had so many desserts in my life.

1010
00:40:50,641 --> 00:40:53,207
They must've been a perfect match.

1011
00:40:54,141 --> 00:40:55,607
(She takes the last bite)

1012
00:40:56,841 --> 00:40:57,707
(Happy)

1013
00:40:57,707 --> 00:40:59,774
Save it in your stomach.

1014
00:40:59,974 --> 00:41:01,074
(She's really enjoying it)

1015
00:41:01,074 --> 00:41:02,707
It's delicious. This is so good.

1016
00:41:02,707 --> 00:41:03,974
I think I will miss this in Korea.

1017
00:41:03,974 --> 00:41:05,807
I didn't know we would eat two desserts.

1018
00:41:05,807 --> 00:41:09,807
I'm looking forward to our upcoming schedules.

1019
00:41:10,141 --> 00:41:11,307
Are you ready to have fun?

1020
00:41:12,674 --> 00:41:13,807
- Wendy. / - Seulgi.

1021
00:41:13,807 --> 00:41:15,274
Digidigidip.

1022
00:41:15,774 --> 00:41:16,941
Go.

1023
00:41:16,941 --> 00:41:18,874
(The first day of Wendy's Day was successful)

1024
00:41:21,074 --> 00:41:23,207
(Second morning in Salzburg)

1025
00:41:24,207 --> 00:41:27,141
(Wendy's Day, Salzburg)

1026
00:41:27,141 --> 00:41:27,707
("The Sound of Music" tour)

1027
00:41:27,707 --> 00:41:30,641
- They're finally going there. / - Finally.

1028
00:41:30,641 --> 00:41:32,041
This seems to be the perfect weather

1029
00:41:32,041 --> 00:41:33,774
for what I prepared.

1030
00:41:33,774 --> 00:41:35,941
What did you prepare? What's with our costumes?

1031
00:41:35,941 --> 00:41:37,741
- It's a dirndl. / - A dirndl?

1032
00:41:37,741 --> 00:41:39,907
Yes, it's the traditional Austrian outfit.

1033
00:41:39,907 --> 00:41:42,441
I like colors that stand out, so I picked red.

1034
00:41:42,441 --> 00:41:43,974
When we think of traditional clothes in Austria...

1035
00:41:43,974 --> 00:41:45,507
This comes to mind.

1036
00:41:45,507 --> 00:41:48,007
I'm wearing something from the Middle Ages.

1037
00:41:48,441 --> 00:41:49,507
The Middle Ages?

1038
00:41:49,507 --> 00:41:50,941
Are there people walking around in those clothes?

1039
00:41:50,941 --> 00:41:52,007
- There are. / - There are a lot of them.

1040
00:41:52,007 --> 00:41:53,907
A lot of children wear them too.

1041
00:41:53,907 --> 00:41:55,174
(I'm wearing a dirndl)

1042
00:41:55,174 --> 00:41:57,141
Where are we going in these costumes?

1043
00:41:57,141 --> 00:41:58,541
Where are we going?

1044
00:41:58,541 --> 00:41:59,874
"The Sound of Music."

1045
00:42:01,041 --> 00:42:02,207
- Have you seen the movie? / - No.

1046
00:42:02,207 --> 00:42:05,274
But I remember that scene on the Alps

1047
00:42:05,274 --> 00:42:07,474
where they sing the "Do Re Mi" song.

1048
00:42:07,474 --> 00:42:09,441
It's the famous scene.

1049
00:42:09,441 --> 00:42:11,574
That was the most impressive scene.

1050
00:42:12,141 --> 00:42:17,141
(A movie based on the true story of the Trapp family)

1051
00:42:17,141 --> 00:42:19,941
(Filmed in Salzburg, a lot of tourists visit the set)

1052
00:42:19,941 --> 00:42:21,507
The movie makes me well up even now.

1053
00:42:21,507 --> 00:42:22,874
The music is so great.

1054
00:42:22,874 --> 00:42:26,174
I prepared a tour for you.

1055
00:42:26,174 --> 00:42:27,341
There are two kinds.

1056
00:42:27,341 --> 00:42:29,374
There's one where you ride a big bus

1057
00:42:29,374 --> 00:42:31,274
with others and look around.

1058
00:42:32,941 --> 00:42:34,741
There's an actual "The Sound of Music" tour.

1059
00:42:34,741 --> 00:42:35,741
- Yes. / - Yes, there is.

1060
00:42:35,741 --> 00:42:39,041
There's another one that's more private.

1061
00:42:39,041 --> 00:42:42,574
You can see things in greater detail.

1062
00:42:42,841 --> 00:42:45,507
The private tour is limited in time.

1063
00:42:45,507 --> 00:42:46,541
After the first 4 hours,

1064
00:42:46,541 --> 00:42:49,141
you have to pay extra every hour.

1065
00:42:49,941 --> 00:42:51,341
Nice to meet you, I'm Wendy.

1066
00:42:51,341 --> 00:42:52,541
Nice to meet you. Good morning.

1067
00:42:52,541 --> 00:42:53,841
- I'm Seulgi. / - Nice to meet you.

1068
00:42:53,841 --> 00:42:55,774
So, first we start by looking around

1069
00:42:55,774 --> 00:42:57,007
the Mirabell Garden.

1070
00:42:57,007 --> 00:42:59,474
- Follow me. / - Okay.

1071
00:43:01,807 --> 00:43:03,374
(Seulgi and Wendy's Digidigidip Tour)

1072
00:43:03,707 --> 00:43:06,941
(Mirabell Garden)

1073
00:43:09,874 --> 00:43:13,174
(It's in front of the palace that was built in 1606)

1074
00:43:13,174 --> 00:43:16,274
(It's a famous spot for a dreamy, romantic wedding)

1075
00:43:18,841 --> 00:43:22,374
("The Sound of Music" tour begins here)

1076
00:43:24,074 --> 00:43:26,274
- It's nice here. / - It's beautiful.

1077
00:43:26,541 --> 00:43:30,774
Mirabell means nice view in Spanish.

1078
00:43:30,774 --> 00:43:33,041
From here, the stairs...

1079
00:43:33,041 --> 00:43:34,207
It's a nice view.

1080
00:43:35,107 --> 00:43:36,741
- Ready? / - It's very nice.

1081
00:43:36,741 --> 00:43:38,907
- It's very broad. / - It is.

1082
00:43:38,907 --> 00:43:40,241
- Where is... / - People have weddings there.

1083
00:43:40,241 --> 00:43:41,774
- Perfect spot? / - Nicest spot is right here.

1084
00:43:41,774 --> 00:43:43,974
- Right here? / - Right here. Turn around.

1085
00:43:43,974 --> 00:43:46,207
You have a nice view of the garden.

1086
00:43:51,474 --> 00:43:53,574
(Doesn't this remind you of a scene from the movie?)

1087
00:43:55,307 --> 00:43:57,407
- Is this it? / - Yes.

1088
00:43:57,407 --> 00:43:58,807
It looks exactly the same.

1089
00:44:01,807 --> 00:44:04,974
(It's exactly like in the movie from over 50 years ago)

1090
00:44:05,207 --> 00:44:06,541
It hasn't changed.

1091
00:44:11,041 --> 00:44:13,507
We built a fortress.

1092
00:44:13,507 --> 00:44:15,174
I wonder what fortress it is.

1093
00:44:15,174 --> 00:44:17,441
What's the name of the fortress over there?

1094
00:44:17,441 --> 00:44:20,407
It's called Hohensalzburg Fortress.

1095
00:44:20,407 --> 00:44:23,474
It's the big castle on top of the mountain

1096
00:44:23,474 --> 00:44:24,874
to protect the city.

1097
00:44:27,307 --> 00:44:29,707
- It was never seized? / - No.

1098
00:44:31,174 --> 00:44:33,074
- It looks cool. / - It hasn't change since back then.

1099
00:44:33,074 --> 00:44:35,041
- Yes. / - It looks exactly the same.

1100
00:44:36,574 --> 00:44:45,541
(It's where Maria gets close with the children)

1101
00:44:49,674 --> 00:44:51,207
(The musical staircase)

1102
00:44:51,207 --> 00:44:54,074
The "Do Re Mi" song. This is here.

1103
00:44:54,074 --> 00:44:57,707
The children walked around here during that song.

1104
00:44:58,241 --> 00:45:00,207
If you want to, you can step up here

1105
00:45:00,207 --> 00:45:01,407
and walk along there.

1106
00:45:01,407 --> 00:45:02,774
Then you feel like the children.

1107
00:45:02,774 --> 00:45:04,374
Look at that.

1108
00:45:06,574 --> 00:45:09,641
(It's Wendy's favorite scene)

1109
00:45:11,841 --> 00:45:15,641
(After being educated in a strict military style)

1110
00:45:15,641 --> 00:45:19,774
(The children gain their innocence through this song)

1111
00:45:29,207 --> 00:45:30,707
It's a very old movie.

1112
00:45:30,707 --> 00:45:33,107
It's amazing the places still remain the same.

1113
00:45:33,107 --> 00:45:34,374
It's been 50 years.

1114
00:45:35,041 --> 00:45:36,707
Everything there is older than me.

1115
00:45:36,874 --> 00:45:39,707
Look on your left, there's Dwarf Garden.

1116
00:45:39,707 --> 00:45:41,507
They're also shown in the movie.

1117
00:45:46,174 --> 00:45:49,074
(Dwarves with comical expressions)

1118
00:45:49,074 --> 00:45:49,941
(Especially, this dwarf)

1119
00:45:49,941 --> 00:45:51,841
I have a picture taken right here.

1120
00:45:52,041 --> 00:45:53,541
- Really? / - Yes.

1121
00:45:59,241 --> 00:46:01,574
(Wendy's nick name is Fun Wendy)

1122
00:46:02,641 --> 00:46:04,007
He has a lump.

1123
00:46:04,541 --> 00:46:06,107
The look on her face is so pretty.

1124
00:46:06,107 --> 00:46:08,041
It looks like this.

1125
00:46:08,041 --> 00:46:09,774
- I can do this. / - Honggi looks the same.

1126
00:46:10,074 --> 00:46:11,407
I can do this.

1127
00:46:12,541 --> 00:46:14,541
(Scanning)

1128
00:46:16,407 --> 00:46:17,907
She gives it a try.

1129
00:46:18,407 --> 00:46:20,374
- Look at that. / - It won't be easy.

1130
00:46:21,141 --> 00:46:23,174
- I look the same, don't I? / - She's so cute.

1131
00:46:23,707 --> 00:46:25,041
(She's good)

1132
00:46:25,807 --> 00:46:27,341
This is fun, imitating the dwarves.

1133
00:46:28,507 --> 00:46:29,874
It looks so beautiful.

1134
00:46:29,874 --> 00:46:32,107
- It's well-maintained. / - It's a beautiful country.

1135
00:46:32,107 --> 00:46:33,407
(Mirabell Garden)

1136
00:46:33,407 --> 00:46:36,541
(Leopoldskron Palace)

1137
00:46:36,541 --> 00:46:39,041
This place was beautiful.

1138
00:46:39,041 --> 00:46:40,307
It's like a picture.

1139
00:46:40,307 --> 00:46:43,441
(Leopoldskron Palace is a rococo style building)

1140
00:46:43,441 --> 00:46:45,074
Rococo style.

1141
00:46:45,074 --> 00:46:47,274
(Located next to a small lake named Lake Weiher)

1142
00:46:50,374 --> 00:46:54,474
(In the movie, it was Captain Von Trapp's mansion)

1143
00:46:55,041 --> 00:47:00,307
(The huge mansion has a beautiful lake at the back)

1144
00:47:02,307 --> 00:47:05,707
(Except for the exterior, all the scenes were shot on set)

1145
00:47:06,074 --> 00:47:07,407
It's so beautiful.

1146
00:47:07,641 --> 00:47:09,407
- I want to live here. / - Me too.

1147
00:47:09,941 --> 00:47:13,307
- I heard it's now being used as a hotel. / - Yes.

1148
00:47:13,307 --> 00:47:16,374
It'll be great to stay in that hotel.

1149
00:47:16,374 --> 00:47:18,741
You can see the lake as you open the window.

1150
00:47:18,741 --> 00:47:20,807
Even if don't stay in the hotel...

1151
00:47:21,407 --> 00:47:24,574
- I'm just happy to walk down the road here. / - True.

1152
00:47:24,574 --> 00:47:26,841
It reminds me of the movie scenes.

1153
00:47:26,841 --> 00:47:29,174
- They were riding on a boat. / - That's right.

1154
00:47:29,174 --> 00:47:33,041
You should watch the movie again before visiting.

1155
00:47:35,507 --> 00:47:38,074
It looks even better with the sunshine.

1156
00:47:38,074 --> 00:47:39,907
I want to live here.

1157
00:47:40,107 --> 00:47:42,441
The clouds and mountains.

1158
00:47:42,774 --> 00:47:45,441
- The hotel is reflected on the lake. / - It's beautiful.

1159
00:47:45,441 --> 00:47:46,741

It's lovely.

It looks like a painting.

1163

- The weather is so nice. / - It was so beautiful.

1164
00:47:53,741 --> 00:47:54,941

(Mirabell Garden, Leopoldskron Palace)

1166
00:47:59,974 --> 00:48:04,374
(St. Gilgen)

1167
00:48:05,107 --> 00:48:07,441
(They drive an hour to the lake)

1168
00:48:07,441 --> 00:48:09,574
Isn't this the song that plays at the start of the movie?

1169
00:48:10,774 --> 00:48:18,141
(It's the best opening scene in the history of cinema)

1170
00:48:24,607 --> 00:48:26,307
The music keeps playing in the car?

1171
00:48:26,307 --> 00:48:28,141
Yes. He keeps playing the songs for each place.

1172
00:48:28,141 --> 00:48:30,107
- Songs for each place? / - Yes.

1173
00:48:30,107 --> 00:48:32,041
- It's part of the tour package. / - That's so nice.

1174
00:48:32,907 --> 00:48:35,074
Welcome to the countryside.

1175
00:48:37,207 --> 00:48:39,107
(Wow)

1176
00:48:42,174 --> 00:48:44,407
(The blue sky and fairy-tale houses)

1177
00:48:44,407 --> 00:48:46,407
- It's just so... / - It just makes you applaud.

1178
00:48:46,407 --> 00:48:48,474
That's right. It just makes me clap.

1179
00:48:48,474 --> 00:48:51,541
It'd be great to live in a house like this.

1180
00:48:52,407 --> 00:48:54,474
This is the place of my dreams.

1181
00:48:54,474 --> 00:48:55,507
I know.

1182
00:48:56,507 --> 00:48:58,641
- It looks like a picture. / - It seems like a fairy-tale.

1183
00:48:58,641 --> 00:48:59,941
Look at the color of the sky.

1184
00:49:00,674 --> 00:49:02,641
It feels like I'm dreaming.

1185
00:49:03,041 --> 00:49:05,241
I think nature is the most beautiful thing.

1186
00:49:05,241 --> 00:49:08,941
If you find a husband, you can start a family.

1187
00:49:10,974 --> 00:49:12,807
I don't want to go back to Korea.

1188
00:49:13,807 --> 00:49:16,407
(Looking around)

1189
00:49:17,007 --> 00:49:18,441
Are those the Alps?

1190
00:49:18,841 --> 00:49:21,274
- All the Alps. / - He says they're the Alps.

1191
00:49:22,041 --> 00:49:24,041
It goes from France to Vienna.

1192
00:49:24,874 --> 00:49:26,607
The Alps.

1193
00:49:26,607 --> 00:49:28,774
- You know Mont Blanc? / - Mont Blanc? Yes.

1194
00:49:28,774 --> 00:49:29,941
Mont Blanc.

1195
00:49:31,074 --> 00:49:32,541
Here, the highest mountain

1196
00:49:32,541 --> 00:49:35,407
is Grossglockner. Almost 4,000m.

1197
00:49:35,674 --> 00:49:37,941
And one here next to...

1198
00:49:37,941 --> 00:49:40,307
(Grossglockner, 3,798m above sea level)

1199
00:49:41,307 --> 00:49:44,841
This place makes women become girls.

1200
00:49:44,841 --> 00:49:46,007
That's how it feels.

1201
00:49:46,607 --> 00:49:48,074
(They pass a small church)

1202
00:49:48,074 --> 00:49:49,841
- The first... / - It's so small.

1203
00:49:49,841 --> 00:49:50,907
It's tiny.

1204
00:49:51,707 --> 00:49:52,641
Wow.

1205
00:49:52,641 --> 00:49:54,507
(The last course of "The Sound of Music" tour)

1206
00:49:56,474 --> 00:49:58,041
He told us to close our eyes...

1207
00:49:58,041 --> 00:49:59,507
- And open them then? / - Yes.

1208
00:50:00,007 --> 00:50:02,141
And this lake spread out before our eyes.

1209
00:50:02,274 --> 00:50:03,607
It was beautiful.

1210
00:50:04,441 --> 00:50:05,674
It looks the same.

1211
00:50:09,941 --> 00:50:11,907
This is the last course of today's trip.

1212
00:50:11,941 --> 00:50:14,841
- You prepared a lot. / - You're hungry, aren't you?

1213
00:50:14,841 --> 00:50:16,074
Yes, I'm a little hungry.

1214
00:50:16,074 --> 00:50:17,774
We should have a picnic at a place like this.

1215
00:50:17,774 --> 00:50:19,174
Women love that.

1216
00:50:19,174 --> 00:50:21,707
At a place like this. We should spread a mat.

1217
00:50:21,707 --> 00:50:22,941
- Shall we eat? / - Yes!

1218
00:50:22,941 --> 00:50:24,441
- Let's enjoy. / - Okay.

1219
00:50:24,441 --> 00:50:26,707
Okay. Let's eat. I'm hungry.

1220
00:50:27,174 --> 00:50:28,507
She brought a lot of fruits.

1221
00:50:28,507 --> 00:50:30,674
I'll eat it enjoying the view.

1222
00:50:31,274 --> 00:50:33,307
Admire the beautiful scenery.

1223
00:50:34,207 --> 00:50:35,674
Take a bite of the pear.

1224
00:50:38,174 --> 00:50:40,107
She planned a great day.

1225
00:50:40,107 --> 00:50:42,274
It looks like a picture on the calendar.

1226
00:50:44,307 --> 00:50:45,441
It's sweet.

1227
00:50:45,841 --> 00:50:47,274
It tastes like a jujube.

1228
00:50:48,307 --> 00:50:49,974
- Is it a pear? / - Right. It's a pear.

1229
00:50:49,974 --> 00:50:52,074
The pear is like a jujube apple.

1230
00:50:52,541 --> 00:50:54,241
It's more like a jujube than a pear.

1231
00:50:54,241 --> 00:50:56,674
It tastes good anyway.

1232
00:50:57,541 --> 00:51:01,607
The lake behind me had the color of emerald.

1233
00:51:01,907 --> 00:51:03,841
- You must've loved it. / - It looks amazing.

1234
00:51:03,841 --> 00:51:05,107
- It was lovely. / - My gosh.

1235
00:51:05,407 --> 00:51:08,407
I didn't know I'd have a picnic here.

1236
00:51:08,874 --> 00:51:11,007
It looks like a composite picture.

1237
00:51:11,007 --> 00:51:12,074
- I think so. / - I know.

1238
00:51:12,074 --> 00:51:14,841
With a chroma key green screen.

1239
00:51:15,241 --> 00:51:17,774
- That's the scene. / - Right. I remember the scene.

1240
00:51:17,774 --> 00:51:20,741
I'm so happy that I can have a picnic

1241
00:51:20,741 --> 00:51:22,374
with such a beautiful view.

1242
00:51:22,374 --> 00:51:23,774
I really want to live here.

1243
00:51:24,541 --> 00:51:27,407
It looks wonderful. I really want to go there.

1244
00:51:27,407 --> 00:51:28,874
I don't know why but it feels like

1245
00:51:28,874 --> 00:51:30,341
I'll sing better if I go there.

1246
00:51:30,941 --> 00:51:33,074
With the fresh air and pretty view,

1247
00:51:33,074 --> 00:51:34,107
I feel like I'll be able to sing better.

1248
00:51:34,207 --> 00:51:37,274
Thank you for preparing all this.

1249
00:51:38,341 --> 00:51:39,941
- You know the "Do Re Mi" song. / - Yes.

1250
00:51:39,941 --> 00:51:41,807
We can make a song of our own.

1251
00:51:42,141 --> 00:51:43,374
Okay. Let's do that.

1252
00:51:43,374 --> 00:51:46,507
We should come up with a word about do.

1253
00:51:46,574 --> 00:51:48,307
Seulgi always tries things like that.

1254
00:51:49,807 --> 00:51:51,274
"A city we'd want to live in."

1255
00:51:51,274 --> 00:51:52,874
??A city we'd want to live in ??

1256
00:51:52,874 --> 00:51:54,407
??A city we'd want to live in ??

1257
00:51:54,407 --> 00:51:55,841
- Re, Red Velvet is here. / - Because we're here.

1258
00:51:55,841 --> 00:51:58,741
Red Velvet came to this beautiful city.

1259
00:51:58,841 --> 00:52:00,074
Mi is...

1260
00:52:02,041 --> 00:52:04,341
- Mi that means beauty. / - That sounds nice.

1261
00:52:04,507 --> 00:52:06,407
Mi for beauty.

1262
00:52:06,907 --> 00:52:09,441
(Mi for beauty)

1263
00:52:09,974 --> 00:52:11,974
They are covering their faces again.

1264
00:52:12,174 --> 00:52:14,641
- It doesn't sound right. / - When did you sing it?

1265
00:52:14,674 --> 00:52:15,907
We even recorded the song.

1266
00:52:16,474 --> 00:52:19,641
(Fa for the pretty blue sky)

1267
00:52:19,641 --> 00:52:23,207
(Sol for the scent of flowers)

1268
00:52:23,207 --> 00:52:26,907
(La for a humming song)

1269
00:52:26,907 --> 00:52:30,741
(Ti for the beginning)

1270
00:52:30,741 --> 00:52:32,241
(Our Battle Trip)

1271
00:52:32,241 --> 00:52:33,274
My goodness.

1272
00:52:33,841 --> 00:52:34,807
Oh, no.

1273
00:52:34,807 --> 00:52:36,741
(Do, re mi, fa, sol, la, ti, do)

1274
00:52:37,341 --> 00:52:38,441
(Cringe)

1275
00:52:38,607 --> 00:52:39,941
Honggi, please help me out.

1276
00:52:39,974 --> 00:52:41,474
I need help myself.

1277
00:52:41,474 --> 00:52:42,707
Seulgi is having a meltdown.

1278
00:52:42,707 --> 00:52:45,474
They keep shooting a movie.

1279
00:52:47,541 --> 00:52:49,241
- Di. / - Gi.

1280
00:52:49,674 --> 00:52:51,274
- Di. / - Gi.

1281
00:52:52,007 --> 00:52:53,107
Dip!

1282
00:52:55,041 --> 00:52:58,541
(Digidigidip Tour, Wendy's Day)

1283
00:52:58,541 --> 00:53:01,874
(Grain Lane)

1284
00:53:02,407 --> 00:53:04,941
Seulgi, this is the Grain Lane.

1285
00:53:04,941 --> 00:53:06,074
It's so beautiful.

1286
00:53:06,074 --> 00:53:08,641
I was surprised as soon as I got here.

1287
00:53:08,641 --> 00:53:11,341
The signs are especially beautiful here.

1288
00:53:11,907 --> 00:53:14,274
They are very old.

1289
00:53:15,074 --> 00:53:17,274
- At least 200 years old. / - 200 years?

1290
00:53:17,274 --> 00:53:18,341
Yes. About 200 years.

1291
00:53:19,307 --> 00:53:20,507
Really?

1292
00:53:20,507 --> 00:53:21,841
Some are like 300 to 400 years old.

1293
00:53:21,841 --> 00:53:24,607
All the signs are specially made...

1294
00:53:24,607 --> 00:53:26,041
- For each shop. / - Right.

1295
00:53:26,041 --> 00:53:28,241
- There's nothing of the same. / - That's 400 years old.

1296
00:53:28,274 --> 00:53:31,141
I heard Mozart's birthplace is on the street.

1297
00:53:31,674 --> 00:53:34,574
(It's the main street of the old downtown of Salzburg)

1298
00:53:34,874 --> 00:53:38,307
Designers go there and take a lot of pictures.

1299
00:53:38,307 --> 00:53:40,074
They take pictures of all the signs there

1300
00:53:40,074 --> 00:53:42,474
and study design with them.

1301
00:53:42,641 --> 00:53:44,441
It's interesting that the signs have pictures.

1302
00:53:44,441 --> 00:53:47,741
In Korea, we only have letters.

1303
00:53:48,141 --> 00:53:51,541
The illiteracy rate was high in the past.

1304
00:53:51,541 --> 00:53:53,274
So they added pictures to help people

1305
00:53:53,274 --> 00:53:54,174
recognize the signs.

1306
00:53:54,174 --> 00:53:55,974
"This is a shoe store

1307
00:53:55,974 --> 00:53:58,541
and that is a clothing store." Like that?

1308
00:53:59,607 --> 00:54:00,841
Big pictures.

1309
00:54:00,841 --> 00:54:03,174
They used pictures instead of letters.

1310
00:54:05,341 --> 00:54:07,741
(The signs made for utilitarian purposes)

1311
00:54:07,741 --> 00:54:10,541
(They are now the brand that represents the street)

1312
00:54:11,607 --> 00:54:13,707
Every sign is so pretty.

1313
00:54:13,707 --> 00:54:15,674
They're like Christmas tree ornaments.

1314
00:54:15,674 --> 00:54:17,107
They are so pretty.

1315
00:54:17,107 --> 00:54:19,507
- It feels like Christmas. / - Right?

1316
00:54:19,507 --> 00:54:22,274
This place must be amazing during Christmas.

1317
00:54:22,774 --> 00:54:23,874
It must be beautiful.

1318
00:54:24,174 --> 00:54:25,907
Seulgi, aren't you hungry?

1319
00:54:25,907 --> 00:54:28,774
- I'm very hungry. / - There's a sausage place.

1320
00:54:29,741 --> 00:54:31,674
Let's go to the famous restaurant and eat.

1321
00:54:31,674 --> 00:54:32,807
Okay.

1322
00:54:33,041 --> 00:54:33,974
Let's go.

1323
00:54:33,974 --> 00:54:42,807
??Shall we enter to eat sausages? ??

1324
00:54:42,807 --> 00:54:43,841
This is the place.

1325
00:54:44,207 --> 00:54:45,474
- Is this it? / - Yes.

1326
00:54:45,874 --> 00:54:48,141
- It's such a random location. / - Right?

1327
00:54:48,541 --> 00:54:50,741
- Is it a famous restaurant? / - They sell hot dogs.

1328
00:54:50,741 --> 00:54:51,974
(Take a byway on the main street)

1329
00:54:52,374 --> 00:54:53,974
It's hard to find the restaurant.

1330
00:54:53,974 --> 00:54:54,907
It's so hidden.

1331
00:54:54,907 --> 00:54:56,674
It's inside the alley.

1332
00:54:58,607 --> 00:55:00,641
(A takeout hotdog stand that opened in the 1950s)

1333
00:55:00,641 --> 00:55:01,874
Look at the long queue.

1334
00:55:04,241 --> 00:55:06,774
- This has to be delicious. / - It was so good.

1335
00:55:06,774 --> 00:55:08,541
- Look at the bread. / - It looks so good.

1336
00:55:08,541 --> 00:55:09,707
Let's sit here.

1337
00:55:10,274 --> 00:55:11,341
Cheers.

1338
00:55:13,574 --> 00:55:15,207
(Crispy)

1339
00:55:16,641 --> 00:55:19,741
(It sounds appetizing)

1340
00:55:21,474 --> 00:55:23,007
(They like it)

1341
00:55:23,007 --> 00:55:25,607
The bread looks like a baguette,

1342
00:55:25,607 --> 00:55:28,007
so I thought it would be hard and chewy.

1343
00:55:28,107 --> 00:55:30,207
Honestly, I thought it would hurt my teeth.

1344
00:55:30,607 --> 00:55:31,907
- I thought it'd be too chewy. / - But...

1345
00:55:31,907 --> 00:55:34,274
It's so soft. It breaks so easily.

1346
00:55:34,274 --> 00:55:35,974
Can you see it?

1347
00:55:36,674 --> 00:55:38,141
It's like a very soft biscuit.

1348
00:55:39,341 --> 00:55:40,974
- The crust is... / - It's like a biscuit.

1349
00:55:40,974 --> 00:55:43,207
It's so soft and warm.

1350
00:55:43,207 --> 00:55:44,841
- It looks so delicious. / - It was really good.

1351
00:55:44,841 --> 00:55:46,141
- I love this. / - Me too.

1352
00:55:47,507 --> 00:55:48,874
(They eat)

1353
00:55:49,907 --> 00:55:50,941
(And eat)

1354
00:55:50,941 --> 00:55:52,807
It's so big. Two people can share one.

1355
00:55:52,807 --> 00:55:55,141
You made up for not eating much there.

1356
00:55:55,141 --> 00:55:57,941
The sausage is not a normal sausage.

1357
00:55:57,941 --> 00:56:00,607
- It's a bit spicy. / - This spiciness...

1358
00:56:01,107 --> 00:56:03,474
- Is it because of the powder? / - I think so.

1359
00:56:03,474 --> 00:56:04,907
Is that turmeric powder?

1360
00:56:05,107 --> 00:56:07,507
- It's curry powder. / - What I like the most is...

1361
00:56:08,474 --> 00:56:09,807
That there are two sausages.

1362
00:56:09,807 --> 00:56:11,007
You like that there are two sausages?

1363
00:56:11,307 --> 00:56:12,374
I'm so moved.

1364
00:56:13,174 --> 00:56:16,307
I'm so moved that there are two sausages in it.

1365
00:56:16,307 --> 00:56:18,407
Seriously, this is moving.

1366
00:56:18,407 --> 00:56:20,341
They give you two sausages.

1367
00:56:20,341 --> 00:56:24,207
They know that one isn't enough.

1368
00:56:24,207 --> 00:56:26,107
She's so happy to have two sausages.

1369
00:56:28,174 --> 00:56:29,241
I love hotdogs.

1370
00:56:29,574 --> 00:56:30,674
- You love hotdogs? / - Yes.

1371
00:56:31,174 --> 00:56:32,341
You haven't tried it, have you?

1372
00:56:32,341 --> 00:56:33,174
Overseas it's...

1373
00:56:33,907 --> 00:56:35,841
- She eats so well. / - She's so cute.

1374
00:56:35,907 --> 00:56:38,241
She keeps eating at a moderate speed.

1375
00:56:38,607 --> 00:56:39,707
She does.

1376
00:56:39,707 --> 00:56:42,074
She quietly goes hard.

1377
00:56:42,374 --> 00:56:44,674
It must be so delicious.

1378
00:56:44,674 --> 00:56:46,007
You're so fast.

1379
00:56:46,607 --> 00:56:49,574
Make the last bite look really delicious.

1380
00:56:49,574 --> 00:56:51,274
(I'm already finished)

1381
00:56:54,907 --> 00:56:56,141
I'm finished.

1382
00:57:00,274 --> 00:57:01,774
Paragliding.

1383
00:57:03,941 --> 00:57:04,941
Can you do that?

1384
00:57:05,407 --> 00:57:06,907
I'm thinking whether I should add it to the list or not.

1385
00:57:07,074 --> 00:57:08,941
But there...

1386
00:57:08,941 --> 00:57:12,741
Korea and Europe have different sceneries.

1387
00:57:12,741 --> 00:57:13,407
So I think it'll be fun.

1388
00:57:13,407 --> 00:57:16,541
- This seems like a must-try in Salzburg. / - Really?

1389
00:57:16,907 --> 00:57:18,707
Then how about we try it?

1390
00:57:19,607 --> 00:57:22,307
Let's just go like that.

1391
00:57:22,507 --> 00:57:23,507
What?

1392
00:57:23,507 --> 00:57:26,741
- We're doing something harder. / - We are?

1393
00:57:27,541 --> 00:57:29,641
(Screaming)

1394
00:57:31,907 --> 00:57:35,541
Oh, my God.

1395
00:57:36,241 --> 00:57:38,674
I'm so happy.

1396
00:57:40,074 --> 00:57:42,607
I'm flying.

1397
00:57:43,707 --> 00:57:45,174
Oh, my God.

1398
00:57:45,174 --> 00:57:47,341
(Paragliding in the Alps)

1399
00:57:47,841 --> 00:57:50,774
(Look down Salzburg and the nature of the Alps)

1400
00:57:50,774 --> 00:57:54,941
(Flight lasts about 20 minutes, $158 per person)

1401
00:57:55,707 --> 00:57:57,074
Why did I bring you here?

1402
00:57:57,407 --> 00:58:00,174
- Why did I bring myself here? / - You planned this.

1403
00:58:00,174 --> 00:58:02,241
Do you think you can do it?

1404
00:58:02,607 --> 00:58:05,107
You look more scared than me. I'll go first.

1405
00:58:05,107 --> 00:58:06,507
If you don't do it, I won't either.

1406
00:58:07,707 --> 00:58:08,807
Is that how it works?

1407
00:58:08,807 --> 00:58:10,441
Yes. If you don't do it, I won't.

1408
00:58:10,707 --> 00:58:12,674
- Hello. / - Hello, hello.

1409
00:58:12,674 --> 00:58:15,074
- Paragliding? / - Yes, we are.

1410
00:58:15,307 --> 00:58:16,441
Are you excited?

1411
00:58:16,774 --> 00:58:18,207
- Nervous. / - Nervous.

1412
00:58:18,207 --> 00:58:19,674
Everybody is.

1413
00:58:19,841 --> 00:58:20,774
It's super easy.

1414
00:58:20,774 --> 00:58:22,674
As soon as you're in the air, you'll enjoy it.

1415
00:58:22,674 --> 00:58:24,574
Are you sure?

1416
00:58:24,574 --> 00:58:26,207
Are you sure it's easy?

1417
00:58:26,707 --> 00:58:30,041
Today, we will take off on the other side.

1418
00:58:30,041 --> 00:58:32,574
Do you want to have a more challenging take off?

1419
00:58:32,574 --> 00:58:34,507
- More challenging? / - Yes.

1420
00:58:34,507 --> 00:58:36,007
- What is he saying? / - The smallest takeoff...

1421
00:58:36,007 --> 00:58:37,407
At the steepest part.

1422
00:58:37,407 --> 00:58:40,207
He's saying we're doing something more difficult.

1423
00:58:40,207 --> 00:58:40,907
We are?

1424
00:58:41,174 --> 00:58:43,341
- It's our first time. / - It's our first time.

1425
00:58:43,974 --> 00:58:45,741
- That's okay. / - Just kidding.

1426
00:58:47,507 --> 00:58:48,774
Just kidding.

1427
00:58:49,207 --> 00:58:50,874
(His joke scared them)

1428
00:58:51,041 --> 00:58:53,341
There's always people who make jokes like that.

1429
00:58:53,341 --> 00:58:54,574
They're laid-back.

1430
00:58:55,341 --> 00:58:56,607
I don't know. Let's just jump.

1431
00:58:57,374 --> 00:58:58,474
It shouldn't be that hard.

1432
00:59:01,174 --> 00:59:03,707
Let's just go like that.

1433
00:59:05,274 --> 00:59:06,674
(Spaced out)

1434
00:59:07,341 --> 00:59:09,474
- It won't be scary. / - It won't.

1435
00:59:09,807 --> 00:59:11,107
You can put this on here.

1436
00:59:11,107 --> 00:59:12,307
You do this...

1437
00:59:12,307 --> 00:59:13,474
This one looks okay.

1438
00:59:13,641 --> 00:59:14,907
Can you hold this for a second?

1439
00:59:14,907 --> 00:59:16,207
I feel good now.

1440
00:59:16,274 --> 00:59:18,207
Don't we have to tighten this more?

1441
00:59:18,207 --> 00:59:19,574
They will do it for us.

1442
00:59:21,407 --> 00:59:26,074
I can't believe my life will be left to that rope.

1443
00:59:26,074 --> 00:59:28,574
That rope looks so weak.

1444
00:59:31,974 --> 00:59:34,941
In flight, we're connected with these carabiners.

1445
00:59:34,941 --> 00:59:35,607
Okay?

1446
00:59:35,707 --> 00:59:38,307
(Seulgi gets trained)

1447
00:59:38,574 --> 00:59:39,874
Pull it.

1448
00:59:39,874 --> 00:59:42,141
- I practiced that too. / - You have to run hard.

1449
00:59:42,141 --> 00:59:43,174
You have to run hard indeed.

1450
00:59:43,174 --> 00:59:45,041
- You will see. Everything will be fine. / - Okay.

1451
00:59:45,774 --> 00:59:47,174
- Perfect. / - It'll be okay.

1452
00:59:47,607 --> 00:59:49,541
Seulgi, you can do it.

1453
00:59:49,541 --> 00:59:50,741
- You can do it. / - She's so cute.

1454
00:59:52,674 --> 00:59:55,607
(Wendy is ready too)

1455
00:59:55,607 --> 00:59:56,674
Wendy looks...

1456
00:59:56,907 --> 00:59:58,741
She looks better with a helmet now.

1457
01:00:00,007 --> 01:00:01,207
It looks better than her original hairstyle.

1458
01:00:01,774 --> 01:00:02,941
With her eyebrows pressed down.

1459
01:00:02,941 --> 01:00:04,641
- Yes. / - Pressed down.

1460
01:00:04,641 --> 01:00:05,474
That way I can recognize her.

1461
01:00:06,907 --> 01:00:10,207
If I never come back,

1462
01:00:10,207 --> 01:00:11,407
please remember me.

1463
01:00:11,507 --> 01:00:13,074
(Laughing)

1464
01:00:13,074 --> 01:00:14,474
(She wants to cry)

1465
01:00:14,474 --> 01:00:16,041
Here I go.

1466
01:00:16,507 --> 01:00:19,541
I'm going.

1467
01:00:19,541 --> 01:00:21,207
- She's scared. / - This is hilarious.

1468
01:00:21,207 --> 01:00:23,441
- Always this direction. Okay? / - Okay.

1469
01:00:23,941 --> 01:00:25,641
- It's so beautiful. / - Seulgi is good with these things.

1470
01:00:25,641 --> 01:00:28,107
I'd love to fly there.

1471
01:00:28,707 --> 01:00:30,174
Seulgi is good with these things.

1472
01:00:31,507 --> 01:00:34,341
I was not nervous earlier but now I am.

1473
01:00:34,341 --> 01:00:36,841
(Her mouth is dry)

1474
01:00:38,274 --> 01:00:39,974
This direction. No fear.

1475
01:00:39,974 --> 01:00:41,774
- Yeah. / - 3, 2, 1, go.

1476
01:00:42,107 --> 01:00:43,307
We just go like this?

1477
01:00:43,307 --> 01:00:44,207
Heading to the other direction.

1478
01:00:44,207 --> 01:00:45,341
We just go like this?

1479
01:00:45,341 --> 01:00:47,107
Heading to the other direction.

1480
01:00:47,107 --> 01:00:48,274
Heading the other direction.

1481
01:00:48,641 --> 01:00:50,074
Heading the other direction.

1482
01:00:50,074 --> 01:00:51,307
- What? / - Like this.

1483
01:00:51,307 --> 01:00:54,007
- And go, go, go. / - Run, run.

1484
01:00:54,874 --> 01:00:55,941
We suddenly started running.

1485
01:00:55,941 --> 01:00:58,374
Go, go, go, go!

1486
01:00:58,541 --> 01:01:01,341
(She flies in the sky)

1487
01:01:01,341 --> 01:01:02,774
Go, go!

1488
01:01:02,774 --> 01:01:07,741
(Screaming)

1489
01:01:11,407 --> 01:01:13,574
(Shouting)

1490
01:01:14,107 --> 01:01:15,907
Wow. What should I do?

1491
01:01:19,374 --> 01:01:21,574
- Having good time? / - Yeah, it's nice.

1492
01:01:21,574 --> 01:01:23,374
- It's perfect. / - Perfect but...

1493
01:01:23,741 --> 01:01:27,141
Where we go?

1494
01:01:27,141 --> 01:01:29,807
We're just flying around. We're next to the mountain.

1495
01:01:29,807 --> 01:01:31,107
To the next mountain?

1496
01:01:32,441 --> 01:01:34,441
I'm flying!

1497
01:01:35,107 --> 01:01:37,107
I'm flying!

1498
01:01:38,941 --> 01:01:40,107
(She flaps her arms)

1499
01:01:40,107 --> 01:01:41,274
Here we are!

1500
01:01:41,741 --> 01:01:43,741
That's right!

1501
01:01:46,307 --> 01:01:47,307
Scary.

1502
01:01:47,641 --> 01:01:50,174
(She's scared and happy at the same time)

1503
01:01:50,174 --> 01:01:52,641
It was amazing but scary.

1504
01:01:52,774 --> 01:01:53,907
Good.

1505
01:01:53,907 --> 01:01:57,307
(She feels free in the sky)

1506
01:01:57,941 --> 01:01:59,174
It's 1,300m above sea level.

1507
01:01:59,174 --> 01:02:01,541
(After Seulgi took off)

1508
01:02:03,607 --> 01:02:04,907
Oh, my God. Oh, no.

1509
01:02:04,907 --> 01:02:06,607
- Me? / - A bit forward.

1510
01:02:08,307 --> 01:02:10,374
I run and then I just put my feet in the air?

1511
01:02:10,741 --> 01:02:12,174
- Just keep going. / - Keep going?

1512
01:02:12,874 --> 01:02:15,107
Don't sit down. Just keep going.

1513
01:02:15,507 --> 01:02:17,341
I run in the air?

1514
01:02:18,741 --> 01:02:20,441
- Ready? / - Yes.

1515
01:02:20,441 --> 01:02:22,674
He told me to keep running in the air too.

1516
01:02:22,774 --> 01:02:24,641
- Run? / - Yes, run.

1517
01:02:25,207 --> 01:02:26,307
Keep going.

1518
01:02:26,941 --> 01:02:28,341
Very well done.

1519
01:02:29,474 --> 01:02:30,474
Very well done.

1520
01:02:30,474 --> 01:02:31,674
(She runs in the air)

1521
01:02:31,674 --> 01:02:33,741
She's running in the air.

1522
01:02:33,941 --> 01:02:35,841
It looks strange.

1523
01:02:35,841 --> 01:02:37,507
He told me to keep running.

1524
01:02:37,507 --> 01:02:39,007
(Wendy flies)

1525
01:02:39,541 --> 01:02:40,874
Oh, my God!

1526
01:02:41,274 --> 01:02:43,374
Oh, my God! This is so good!

1527
01:02:43,907 --> 01:02:46,141
(Wendy is excited again)

1528
01:02:47,507 --> 01:02:48,641
I love it!

1529
01:02:49,974 --> 01:02:51,807
Oh, my God!

1530
01:02:51,807 --> 01:02:53,907
Wendy was really scared at first but...

1531
01:02:53,907 --> 01:02:55,007
But now she's not.

1532
01:02:55,007 --> 01:02:57,474
It looks like she's enjoying it more than Seulgi.

1533
01:02:57,707 --> 01:03:00,774
She suddenly sings.

1534
01:03:01,041 --> 01:03:04,041
(Her voice is stable even 1,000m above the ground)

1535
01:03:19,907 --> 01:03:22,874
This is beautiful. Oh, my God.

1536
01:03:22,874 --> 01:03:25,341
- It was indescribable. / - Amazing.

1537
01:03:25,341 --> 01:03:28,507
It was different from what I see from the airplane.

1538
01:03:28,507 --> 01:03:30,541
- It's different. / - Of course it's different.

1539
01:03:30,541 --> 01:03:34,074
It's different to be in the air, feeling the wind myself.

1540
01:03:34,074 --> 01:03:36,241
Look. It's surrounded by the mountains.

1541
01:03:37,474 --> 01:03:42,607
(She can see all of Salzburg)

1542
01:03:44,307 --> 01:03:48,441
(Behind that is the Alps)

1543
01:03:50,274 --> 01:03:54,074
(Unless you're in the sky, you can't see)

1544
01:03:56,274 --> 01:04:00,807
(Such beautiful scenery)

1545
01:04:01,441 --> 01:04:02,207
Right now...

1546
01:04:02,941 --> 01:04:05,441
I'm so happy.

1547
01:04:06,274 --> 01:04:09,974
No matter how high a building is,

1548
01:04:09,974 --> 01:04:13,107
you can't feel such a wind on it.

1549
01:04:13,774 --> 01:04:14,907
This is so much fun.

1550
01:04:14,907 --> 01:04:15,541
When you paraglide,

1551
01:04:15,541 --> 01:04:18,407
sometimes, birds come and fly with you.

1552
01:04:18,407 --> 01:04:20,907
- They fly next to you? / - Yes, they do.

1553
01:04:22,341 --> 01:04:24,741
(Seulgi looks more relaxed now)

1554
01:04:24,741 --> 01:04:26,474
- Really nice. / - Really nice.

1555
01:04:26,474 --> 01:04:28,441
Do you want to try flying on your own?

1556
01:04:28,441 --> 01:04:29,607
No. No.

1557
01:04:29,607 --> 01:04:31,141
- Really? / - No, no, no.

1558
01:04:31,207 --> 01:04:32,474
- Okay. / - No...

1559
01:04:32,474 --> 01:04:33,474
(He surprised me)

1560
01:04:34,707 --> 01:04:36,541
It looks so scary down there.

1561
01:04:36,941 --> 01:04:38,574
I will hand you the camera.

1562
01:04:39,441 --> 01:04:41,674
No, no, no.

1563
01:04:41,674 --> 01:04:43,107
You have to.

1564
01:04:43,107 --> 01:04:45,307
Every time... You can't lose it.

1565
01:04:45,307 --> 01:04:47,041
Every time a red light flashes...

1566
01:04:47,041 --> 01:04:48,741
Sorry, I can't speak English.

1567
01:04:48,741 --> 01:04:51,041
It's all good. No worries.

1568
01:04:51,041 --> 01:04:52,307
Everything is good.

1569
01:04:52,474 --> 01:04:54,074
This is...

1570
01:04:55,207 --> 01:04:57,441
- This doesn't feel safe. / - He kept laughing.

1571
01:04:57,441 --> 01:04:58,707
(Chris kept playing jokes)

1572
01:05:00,407 --> 01:05:01,541
He was being too mean.

1573
01:05:01,541 --> 01:05:04,441
It's really scary if you let go. It swoops down.

1574
01:05:04,441 --> 01:05:07,907
Go straight. Go straight.

1575
01:05:08,341 --> 01:05:09,907
(What is she doing?)

1576
01:05:09,907 --> 01:05:12,141
- She's so cute. / - That's survival English.

1577
01:05:12,141 --> 01:05:14,441
- She's cute. / - Your English is getting better.

1578
01:05:14,441 --> 01:05:15,907
Calm down.

1579
01:05:18,741 --> 01:05:20,607
He's having so much fun.

1580
01:05:21,341 --> 01:05:23,541
Oh, my God.

1581
01:05:24,541 --> 01:05:26,774
There are the other ones coming.

1582
01:05:26,774 --> 01:05:29,141
- I'm so jealous. / - It was so nice.

1583
01:05:29,141 --> 01:05:30,741
It must've been so good because of the weather.

1584
01:05:30,741 --> 01:05:32,407
I'm eagle.

1585
01:05:32,407 --> 01:05:34,207
- "I'm eagle." / - She's an eagle?

1586
01:05:34,207 --> 01:05:36,774
- I'm eagle. / - I'm an eagle.

1587
01:05:37,107 --> 01:05:39,607
Now we have to... Shall we do a roller coaster?

1588
01:05:39,607 --> 01:05:40,941
Roller coaster? No, no, no.

1589
01:05:40,941 --> 01:05:42,241
No. You're scared.

1590
01:05:42,241 --> 01:05:44,741
- I know this. / - They will spin now.

1591
01:05:44,741 --> 01:05:46,074
- It is so dizzy. / - It will make you vomit.

1592
01:05:46,074 --> 01:05:48,307
- I was so dizzy after that. / - Don't do it.

1593
01:05:48,307 --> 01:05:51,007
- You have to do a small roller coaster. / - Okay.

1594
01:05:52,707 --> 01:05:54,974
Roller coaster.

1595
01:05:54,974 --> 01:05:56,507
(Screaming)

1596
01:05:59,141 --> 01:06:01,141
I'm flying.

1597
01:06:01,541 --> 01:06:04,207
I'm flying.

1598
01:06:05,174 --> 01:06:07,541
- Very good. / - Oh, my.

1599
01:06:08,007 --> 01:06:11,174
Your voice range must have become higher after this.

1600
01:06:11,174 --> 01:06:12,841
It became really high.

1601
01:06:16,707 --> 01:06:18,207
Touchdown.

1602
01:06:18,207 --> 01:06:20,174
- You did a good job. / - She really landed well.

1603
01:06:21,174 --> 01:06:22,974
I'm not afraid of anything anymore.

1604
01:06:24,041 --> 01:06:25,441
Seulgi, you did a good job.

1605
01:06:26,774 --> 01:06:29,974
I think Wendy will be shouting out

1606
01:06:29,974 --> 01:06:32,374
exclamations of surprise in English.

1607
01:06:33,207 --> 01:06:38,774
Wow. Oh, my God. That was amazing.

1608
01:06:43,241 --> 01:06:45,474
Her voice is really loud.

1609
01:06:49,907 --> 01:06:52,274
This is amazing.

1610
01:06:56,141 --> 01:06:58,341
Wendy, I can see you're super-talented.

1611
01:06:58,341 --> 01:06:59,807
- She's controlling it herself. / - Yes.

1612
01:06:59,807 --> 01:07:01,274
It was so fun to do it.

1613
01:07:01,274 --> 01:07:03,274
- We go left, right, left, right. / - Okay.

1614
01:07:05,641 --> 01:07:07,441
You went round and round.

1615
01:07:07,441 --> 01:07:09,441
It was really fun.

1616
01:07:14,541 --> 01:07:16,574
This was fun.

1617
01:07:18,874 --> 01:07:20,874
(Welcome back)

1618
01:07:25,374 --> 01:07:26,907
(Lands lightly)

1619
01:07:26,907 --> 01:07:28,141
- She landed well. / - She did a good job.

1620
01:07:28,141 --> 01:07:29,874
- She really did. / - Didn't she do a good job?

1621
01:07:30,241 --> 01:07:31,474
So, Wendy.

1622
01:07:31,607 --> 01:07:34,141
- How was it? / - I was so happy.

1623
01:07:34,407 --> 01:07:35,607
I'm shaking right now.

1624
01:07:36,174 --> 01:07:37,474
- Are your legs shaking like this? / - Yes.

1625
01:07:37,474 --> 01:07:38,941
I'm shaking.

1626
01:07:38,974 --> 01:07:40,341
Little bit. That's normal.

1627
01:07:40,341 --> 01:07:42,374
- I loved it so much. / - It will be gone in a minute.

1628
01:07:42,874 --> 01:07:43,874
I loved it so much.

1629
01:07:43,874 --> 01:07:45,541
Great memory. Thank you.

1630
01:07:46,407 --> 01:07:48,007
I think she enjoyed it the most...

1631
01:07:48,007 --> 01:07:50,041
- Yes, she enjoyed the most. / - Out of everyone.

1632
01:07:50,041 --> 01:07:50,874
I was so happy.

1633
01:07:50,874 --> 01:07:53,441
- It's so beautiful. / - I'm so jealous.

1634
01:07:54,207 --> 01:07:56,407
He kept saying something in English.

1635
01:07:56,407 --> 01:07:58,507
- I couldn't understand him. / - I did this.

1636
01:07:58,507 --> 01:08:00,574
I kept saying, "Yeah, it's good."

1637
01:08:00,574 --> 01:08:02,941
He let me control it.

1638
01:08:02,941 --> 01:08:05,474
I didn't know he was asking that.

1639
01:08:05,674 --> 01:08:07,441
He asked me but I just said, "No, no, no."

1640
01:08:07,441 --> 01:08:08,907
Really?

1641
01:08:09,907 --> 01:08:12,974
I was so happy. I just loved it.

1642
01:08:13,641 --> 01:08:15,874
There's no other way to express it.

1643
01:08:15,874 --> 01:08:18,374
You won't know unless you experience it.

1644
01:08:18,374 --> 01:08:20,107
She makes us happy to watch.

1645
01:08:21,407 --> 01:08:23,007
I felt like I was born again.

1646
01:08:23,007 --> 01:08:26,074
I felt like a new born bird

1647
01:08:26,074 --> 01:08:28,907
that was walking for the first time.

1648
01:08:30,141 --> 01:08:32,407
- Really? Did you feel that? / - Yes.

1649
01:08:33,407 --> 01:08:35,907
- I feel like I was reborn. / - You will start from zero.

1650
01:08:35,907 --> 01:08:36,907
Waah.

1651
01:08:37,874 --> 01:08:38,874
Waah.

1652
01:08:38,874 --> 01:08:40,141
(Happy birthday)

1653
01:08:41,274 --> 01:08:43,774
Yeah. Let's learn how to talk again.

1654
01:08:43,774 --> 01:08:45,241
Waah, waah.

1655
01:08:49,874 --> 01:08:52,741
They had a good time. Is this their last course?

1656
01:08:53,341 --> 01:08:54,307
It's the last course.

1657
01:08:54,307 --> 01:08:55,774
The night view of your life.

1658
01:08:55,774 --> 01:08:58,307
It's not a plain night view, it's the best ever.

1659
01:08:59,507 --> 01:09:05,407
Austria with the setting sun is also really pretty.

1660
01:09:06,074 --> 01:09:08,441
- The color is so pretty. / - It's pink.

1661
01:09:08,874 --> 01:09:10,141
It's pink and purple.

1662
01:09:10,974 --> 01:09:12,441
Look at the clouds. They're also really pretty.

1663
01:09:12,441 --> 01:09:13,607
Yes.

1664
01:09:18,607 --> 01:09:20,241
There are a lot of locks.

1665
01:09:21,274 --> 01:09:23,607
I think this bridge is a meaningful place.

1666
01:09:23,607 --> 01:09:27,341
It's really pretty because it has various colors.

1667
01:09:27,341 --> 01:09:29,874
Hyorim, did you also put a lock there?

1668
01:09:29,874 --> 01:09:32,274
- Of course, I did everything alone. / - Did you do it?

1669
01:09:32,274 --> 01:09:33,274
- Good job. / - Yes.

1670
01:09:33,807 --> 01:09:35,874
I can't believe there are so many people

1671
01:09:35,874 --> 01:09:37,274
wishing for happiness.

1672
01:09:39,341 --> 01:09:42,641
(Makartsteg Bridge is very romantic)

1673
01:09:43,107 --> 01:09:46,474
You'll be really surprised if you know what time it is.

1674
01:09:46,774 --> 01:09:48,241
It's 9:06 p.m.

1675
01:09:48,674 --> 01:09:50,041
- It's 9:06 in the evening. / - It's so bright here.

1676
01:09:50,041 --> 01:09:52,307
It's 9:06 in the evening...

1677
01:09:52,307 --> 01:09:53,974
- But it's so bright outside. / - It's so bright outside.

1678
01:09:53,974 --> 01:09:56,441
It's so bright outside. This was from a Korean.

1679
01:09:56,607 --> 01:09:57,974
It's Hyorim's lock.

1680
01:09:57,974 --> 01:09:59,041
Isn't it Hyorim's lock?

1681
01:09:59,307 --> 01:10:00,874
Did Hyorim write someone else's name?

1682
01:10:00,874 --> 01:10:02,574
Hyorim and who?

1683
01:10:02,974 --> 01:10:05,241
They are surprised after seeing a man's name on it.

1684
01:10:05,941 --> 01:10:07,107
- That's why they just left. / - It got edited.

1685
01:10:07,107 --> 01:10:08,374
- It got edited. / - That's why.

1686
01:10:08,374 --> 01:10:09,541
That's very considerate.

1687
01:10:13,674 --> 01:10:15,574
(Where they will see the night view)

1688
01:10:17,041 --> 01:10:19,407
(They arrive at the observatory)

1689
01:10:19,407 --> 01:10:21,307
- Observatory? / - There must be a place to see that.

1690
01:10:21,307 --> 01:10:23,741
- Yes, there is. / - They didn't use to have one.

1691
01:10:24,041 --> 01:10:26,474
- We have to go back and forth. / - For two people?

1692
01:10:26,474 --> 01:10:27,741
(Monchsberg observatory, downtown Salzburg )

1693
01:10:28,074 --> 01:10:29,241
It's automatic.

1694
01:10:29,241 --> 01:10:31,674
- Is there an observatory? / - It's faster...

1695
01:10:31,674 --> 01:10:33,274
- If you use the elevator. / - Yes.

1696
01:10:33,541 --> 01:10:34,774
It's high.

1697
01:10:34,907 --> 01:10:38,007
It operates until 11 p.m. during July to August.

1698
01:10:38,007 --> 01:10:40,241
For the other months, it only operates until 9 p.m.

1699
01:10:40,241 --> 01:10:41,874
It only operates until 11 p.m. for the summer

1700
01:10:41,874 --> 01:10:43,474
and 9 p.m. for the other months.

1701
01:10:43,741 --> 01:10:45,907
Let's see how pretty the night view is.

1702
01:10:46,174 --> 01:10:48,641
Seulgi, don't look yet. Wait, don't look.

1703
01:10:48,641 --> 01:10:50,841
Just go to the right. Don't look.

1704
01:10:52,207 --> 01:10:55,707
Come down. Continue to come down.

1705
01:10:55,707 --> 01:10:57,407
- Come down. / - Can I trust you?

1706
01:10:57,407 --> 01:10:58,441
Trust me. Come down.

1707
01:10:59,041 --> 01:11:00,241
Continue to come down.

1708
01:11:00,307 --> 01:11:01,307
Are you ready?

1709
01:11:02,141 --> 01:11:03,407
1, 2, 3.

1710
01:11:04,574 --> 01:11:06,307
(Wow)

1711
01:11:08,307 --> 01:11:09,541
How is it?

1712
01:11:11,607 --> 01:11:13,374
- It's so pretty. / - If you come here...

1713
01:11:13,607 --> 01:11:18,441
Slowly after crossing the bridge at 9 p.m.

1714
01:11:18,441 --> 01:11:22,141
while enjoying the sunset...

1715
01:11:22,141 --> 01:11:24,274
You will be able to see this amazing night view.

1716
01:11:25,841 --> 01:11:27,107
I really want to go there.

1717
01:11:27,841 --> 01:11:30,707
The buildings are low. I can see the castle over there.

1718
01:11:30,707 --> 01:11:33,541
It feels like I've gone back in time.

1719
01:11:33,541 --> 01:11:34,941
There's one more thing.

1720
01:11:34,941 --> 01:11:38,374
Do you see the red light on top over there?

1721
01:11:38,374 --> 01:11:39,441
No way.

1722
01:11:39,741 --> 01:11:41,741
- Is that where we did paragliding? / - You're right.

1723
01:11:41,741 --> 01:11:44,941
Good job. That's the answer.

1724
01:11:44,941 --> 01:11:47,541
- Did we jump from there? / - Yes, that's right.

1725
01:11:47,541 --> 01:11:49,374
We jumped from 1,280m.

1726
01:11:49,374 --> 01:11:51,907
We came back alive.

1727
01:11:51,907 --> 01:11:53,241
There's nothing we can't do.

1728
01:11:56,807 --> 01:11:57,907
That's the best.

1729
01:11:57,907 --> 01:11:59,007
It was so nice.

1730
01:11:59,007 --> 01:12:01,207
- I admit that it's nice. / - The course was so good.

1731
01:12:01,207 --> 01:12:03,274
- Including the observatory. / - Yes.

1732
01:12:03,774 --> 01:12:05,874
Do you see the two towers?

1733
01:12:05,874 --> 01:12:09,041
The opposite side is the Mirabell Garden.

1734
01:12:09,041 --> 01:12:09,941
It's there?

1735
01:12:09,941 --> 01:12:11,574
It's everything we did today.

1736
01:12:11,574 --> 01:12:12,941
- You can see everything. / - Yes, everything.

1737
01:12:12,941 --> 01:12:15,574
They are all the places we went today.

1738
01:12:15,574 --> 01:12:17,674
- We went everywhere. / - Yes.

1739
01:12:17,674 --> 01:12:20,341
It summarizes the whole trip when you go up there.

1740
01:12:20,341 --> 01:12:21,741
- Isn't that right? / - Yes, that's right.

1741
01:12:22,041 --> 01:12:24,341
It has only been 4 days

1742
01:12:24,341 --> 01:12:29,607
but I think we had such a meaningful time

1743
01:12:29,607 --> 01:12:31,141
while visiting all the hidden...

1744
01:12:31,141 --> 01:12:33,007
- And famous places in Austria. / - That's right.

1745
01:12:33,007 --> 01:12:34,774
I was happy.

1746
01:12:35,241 --> 01:12:37,707
I think this is the first time I've ever felt alive.

1747
01:12:37,707 --> 01:12:38,841
This place was so nice.

1748
01:12:38,841 --> 01:12:41,541
If we come here again later, I don't think...

1749
01:12:41,541 --> 01:12:44,441
- It will feel like this. / - It won't feel like this.

1750
01:12:44,441 --> 01:12:46,441
- We won't be able to experience this. / - Yes.

1751
01:12:46,441 --> 01:12:49,141
I really want to live here. I was so happy.

1752
01:12:49,141 --> 01:12:50,941
That's what we should've done for our last day.

1753
01:12:50,941 --> 01:12:52,407
- Good job. / - Yes.

1754
01:12:52,907 --> 01:12:54,941
- You did a good job, friend. / - Good job.

1755
01:12:57,341 --> 01:12:58,341
Should we just enjoy the view?

1756
01:12:58,341 --> 01:13:00,507
(They were happy because they were together)

1757
01:13:02,274 --> 01:13:04,174
(Digidigidip in Austria)

1758
01:13:04,174 --> 01:13:05,341
It's pretty.

1759
01:13:08,941 --> 01:13:10,107
Lee Teuk, how was it?

1760
01:13:10,107 --> 01:13:12,207
- I was really jealous. / - Right?

1761
01:13:12,207 --> 01:13:16,007
I didn't think the paragliding would be special,

1762
01:13:16,007 --> 01:13:17,241
but I wanted to jump after seeing this.

1763
01:13:17,241 --> 01:13:19,207
- Right? / - I want to see the night view.

1764
01:13:19,207 --> 01:13:21,174
I even want to hang a lock there.

1765
01:13:22,241 --> 01:13:25,541
"The Sound of Music" tour was detailed and fun.

1766
01:13:25,541 --> 01:13:27,407
- Right? / - I really like that movie.

1767
01:13:27,407 --> 01:13:29,574
- I really want to go there. / - Haven't you been there?

1768
01:13:29,574 --> 01:13:31,574
I think I watched the movie at least 30 times.

1769
01:13:31,574 --> 01:13:35,007
I listened to the music enough to memorize the lyrics.

1770
01:13:35,007 --> 01:13:36,174
- Go there. / - You have to go there.

1771
01:13:36,174 --> 01:13:37,807
- I really want to go there. / - You should go there.

1772
01:13:37,807 --> 01:13:39,341
- I was so surprised. / - It feels very different.

1773
01:13:39,341 --> 01:13:41,107
Wasn't the tour so nice?

1774
01:13:41,107 --> 01:13:43,907
There are cheaper courses and more expensive ones?

1775
01:13:43,907 --> 01:13:47,174
Yes, for people who want to enjoy a deeper tour,

1776
01:13:47,174 --> 01:13:49,174
there's a longer course that goes to

1777
01:13:49,174 --> 01:13:50,341
the Salzkammergut,

1778
01:13:50,341 --> 01:13:53,007
that is located in the outskirts.

1779
01:13:53,007 --> 01:13:55,074
So I think it will be nice

1780
01:13:55,074 --> 01:13:59,807
if you chose the tour according to your situation.

1781
01:13:59,807 --> 01:14:01,541
It was so nice

1782
01:14:01,541 --> 01:14:04,407
that both of them were really happy

1783
01:14:04,407 --> 01:14:07,341
instead of pretending to enjoy it for the show.

1784
01:14:07,341 --> 01:14:10,507
- That's right. / - I could tell that they were...

1785
01:14:10,507 --> 01:14:12,474
Really excited and happy.

1786
01:14:12,474 --> 01:14:13,507
- That's right. / - Yes.

1787
01:14:13,507 --> 01:14:14,507
- Isn't that right? / - Yes.

1788
01:14:14,507 --> 01:14:17,274
That's what it must feel like to be a bird.

1789
01:14:17,274 --> 01:14:18,507
That's right.

1790
01:14:18,507 --> 01:14:20,207
Do you have any tips for paragliding?

1791
01:14:20,807 --> 01:14:23,241
You can go higher when the wind is stronger.

1792
01:14:23,241 --> 01:14:25,874
- So go in the morning. / - Is the morning better?

1793
01:14:25,874 --> 01:14:27,974
- Yes. / - Avoid doing it when it's cold.

1794
01:14:27,974 --> 01:14:29,707
I tried it once in Switzerland.

1795
01:14:29,707 --> 01:14:32,241
If it's too cold, it's hard to endure.

1796
01:14:32,241 --> 01:14:33,974
- That's right. / - Seulgi and Wendy.

1797
01:14:33,974 --> 01:14:36,607
When did you think you wanted to live there?

1798
01:14:36,607 --> 01:14:39,207
After "The Sound of Music" tour,

1799
01:14:39,207 --> 01:14:41,307
I automatically kept saying

1800
01:14:41,307 --> 01:14:44,041
I want to live here without thinking about it.

1801
01:14:44,041 --> 01:14:47,341
I kept saying that I was happy.

1802
01:14:47,574 --> 01:14:50,441
For me, it was when I saw the night view.

1803
01:14:50,441 --> 01:14:51,441
- When you saw the night view. / - Yes.

1804
01:14:51,441 --> 01:14:55,207
I really wanted to live there where

1805
01:14:55,207 --> 01:14:57,841
I could make so many precious memories.

1806
01:14:58,074 --> 01:15:00,774
Okay, let's find out the final expense.

1807
01:15:00,774 --> 01:15:04,607
How much did they spend for 5 nights and 6 days?

1808
01:15:04,607 --> 01:15:06,041
- I'm a little nervous because... / - Yes.

1809
01:15:06,041 --> 01:15:08,574
The cost of activities and everything is expensive.

1810
01:15:08,574 --> 01:15:10,407
- Yes. / - Things are expensive in Austria.

1811
01:15:10,407 --> 01:15:12,707
- That's why we took the helicopter. / - That's right.

1812
01:15:13,274 --> 01:15:14,341
Let's see it.

1813
01:15:14,474 --> 01:15:15,941
For 5 nights and 6 days,

1814
01:15:15,941 --> 01:15:18,907
the final expense of the Digidigidip Tour...

1815
01:15:18,907 --> 01:15:19,907
What's the final expense?

1816
01:15:19,907 --> 01:15:21,974

1817

$1,306.40.

1819
01:15:27,107 --> 01:15:28,607
- It's less. / - It's similar.

1820
01:15:28,607 --> 01:15:31,174
- The difference isn't big. / - I think we spent $5 less.

1821
01:15:31,374 --> 01:15:32,874
- Is it a $5 difference? / - Yes.

1822
01:15:32,874 --> 01:15:34,807
- A $5 difference. / - Yes.

1823
01:15:34,807 --> 01:15:37,407
A 5 vote and $5 difference.

1824
01:15:38,474 --> 01:15:40,974
Please say your last words...

1825
01:15:40,974 --> 01:15:43,441
To persuade the hearts of the judges.

1826
01:15:43,441 --> 01:15:46,074
If you prepare your trip

1827

according to our tour,

1828
01:15:48,241 --> 01:15:51,807
you will be able to feel like you're born again.

1829
01:15:51,807 --> 01:15:54,041
Austria has a lot of delicious food

1830
01:15:54,041 --> 01:15:56,841
and many places to see.

1831
01:15:56,841 --> 01:16:00,141
So I wish you would vote for us.

01:16:21,007 --> 01:16:23,841
Will it be the Realistic Sibling Tour to Canada?

1839
01:16:23,841 --> 01:16:26,507
Or the Digidigidip Tour to Austria?

1840

I believe that I should keep the promises I made.

1866
01:17:28,974 --> 01:17:29,607
There's nothing I can do about it.

1867
01:17:29,607 --> 01:17:31,107
I should come back since we lost.

1868
