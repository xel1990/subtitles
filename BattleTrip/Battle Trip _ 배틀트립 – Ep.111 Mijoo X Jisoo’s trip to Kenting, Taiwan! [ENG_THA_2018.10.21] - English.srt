1
00:00:00,074 --> 00:00:02,008
This is Xiamen. 

2
00:00:02,008 --> 00:00:03,774
(Xiamen, China) 

3
00:00:06,908 --> 00:00:09,741
- It's so nice here. / - It's so great. 

4
00:00:09,741 --> 00:00:10,974
It's so pretty. 

5
00:00:10,974 --> 00:00:13,541
I'm really looking forward to this. 

6
00:00:14,741 --> 00:00:16,374
This makes me happy. 

7
00:00:17,341 --> 00:00:19,274
Agar taste very good. 

8
00:00:19,274 --> 00:00:20,508
It's just my style. 

9
00:00:20,508 --> 00:00:24,141
Walking around together all day long. 

10
00:00:24,141 --> 00:00:26,508
It was such a precious day. 

11
00:00:26,508 --> 00:00:28,474
Best of the best. 

12
00:00:28,474 --> 00:00:31,174
(Which team will win?) 

13
00:00:33,008 --> 00:00:36,441
(Numerous great tips on trips) 

14
00:00:37,574 --> 00:00:38,808
(Yang Heeeun, Yang Heekyeong) 

15
00:00:39,574 --> 00:00:40,941
(Mijoo and Jisoo of Lovelyz) 

16
00:00:41,874 --> 00:00:42,974
(Special host, Heo Youngji) 

17
00:00:44,741 --> 00:00:45,841
Travel is war. 

18
00:00:45,841 --> 00:00:48,308
Battle Trip. 

19
00:00:51,341 --> 00:00:55,508
Just like last week, we have the trip planners 

20
00:00:55,508 --> 00:00:57,908
who went on special trips with their sisters. Welcome. 

21
00:00:57,908 --> 00:00:58,908
(Highly recommend the itinerary they planned) 

22
00:01:00,608 --> 00:01:03,408
We have our 100 impartial judges 

23
00:01:03,408 --> 00:01:05,441
who will vote on today's trips. 

24
00:01:05,441 --> 00:01:08,674
(100 judges in the audience) 

25
00:01:08,674 --> 00:01:13,041
Heeeun's concert tour is about to start, right? 

26
00:01:13,041 --> 00:01:13,874
Yes. 

27
00:01:13,874 --> 00:01:16,241
- What about Heekyeong? / - What about you? 

28
00:01:16,441 --> 00:01:20,308
I'm on a new KBS show called... 

29
00:01:20,308 --> 00:01:22,841
- "Twilight Delight." / - "Twilight Delight." 

30
00:01:22,841 --> 00:01:25,708
That airs every Tuesday at 11 p.m. 

31
00:01:25,708 --> 00:01:27,908
- I'm on the show with my two sons. / - That's right. 

32
00:01:28,141 --> 00:01:29,941
I'm busy these days with that show. 

33
00:01:30,108 --> 00:01:32,541
On weekends, I'm in a play called "The Mousetrap." 

34
00:01:32,541 --> 00:01:33,908
You're in a play. 

35
00:01:34,708 --> 00:01:36,808
- Both of you are so energetic. / - They really are. 

36
00:01:36,808 --> 00:01:39,141
- We're just doing our best. / - That's the best. 

37
00:01:39,541 --> 00:01:43,608
So many people wanted to go to Xiamen 

38
00:01:43,608 --> 00:01:44,874
after they saw your trip. 

39
00:01:44,874 --> 00:01:47,108
- There were a lot of them. / - Youngji said... 

40
00:01:47,108 --> 00:01:49,574
She should go there herself after watching their trip. 

41
00:01:49,574 --> 00:01:49,974
Yes. 

42
00:01:49,974 --> 00:01:51,841
- She wants to go there for food. / - To Xiamen? 

43
00:01:52,374 --> 00:01:54,008
- Youngji and I made a promise. / - That's right. 

44
00:01:54,341 --> 00:01:56,041
- She and I... / - What? 

45
00:01:56,041 --> 00:01:57,641
- Sorry. / - Are you telling her to come here? 

46
00:01:58,041 --> 00:01:59,274
Come here. It's okay. 

47
00:01:59,274 --> 00:02:00,674
- I'm sorry. / - Hey. 

48
00:02:01,041 --> 00:02:02,108
I forgot I was in this team. 

49
00:02:02,108 --> 00:02:04,941
(She's supposed to be on Lovelyz's side) 

50
00:02:04,941 --> 00:02:07,841
- She's so cute. / - Youngji, go to Xiamen first... 

51
00:02:07,841 --> 00:02:09,341
- And then ride a boat to Taiwan. / - He's right. 

52
00:02:09,341 --> 00:02:10,574
- You can go to Taiwan in one hour. / - You're right. 

53
00:02:10,574 --> 00:02:12,374
- I'll go to Taiwan first... / - Yes. 

54
00:02:12,374 --> 00:02:14,141
And have a lot of fun there. 

55
00:02:14,141 --> 00:02:17,141
Then if I have some time left, I'll go to Xiamen. 

56
00:02:17,374 --> 00:02:18,541
Alright. 

57
00:02:18,541 --> 00:02:21,674
If that's what you think, you might regret it later. 

58
00:02:21,674 --> 00:02:22,908
If you have some time left? 

59
00:02:23,174 --> 00:02:24,441
You'll regret it thinking you should've come here first. 

60
00:02:24,441 --> 00:02:25,841
- She'll want to stay longer. / - Right. 

61
00:02:25,841 --> 00:02:26,941
Have you been to Taiwan? 

62
00:02:27,641 --> 00:02:29,908
- I haven't. / - You should go there soon. 

63
00:02:29,908 --> 00:02:32,008
- Yes, I'm going to. / - You should go there. 

64
00:02:32,308 --> 00:02:34,741
Today, we're going to check out... 

65
00:02:34,741 --> 00:02:36,308
- Their trip to Taiwan. / - That's right. 

66
00:02:36,308 --> 00:02:37,741
We have never heard of this place before. 

67
00:02:37,741 --> 00:02:38,808
There's renting and venting and... 

68
00:02:38,808 --> 00:02:40,308
- Kenting. / - Kenting. 

69
00:02:40,641 --> 00:02:42,008
- Renting, venting... / - It's Kenting. 

70
00:02:42,008 --> 00:02:44,241
- Let's see where it is. / - Let's check out the map. 

71
00:02:45,441 --> 00:02:47,308
- It's in the south. / - It's down there. 

72
00:02:47,308 --> 00:02:49,674
- It's in the south. / - It's further south than Kaohsiung. 

73
00:02:49,674 --> 00:02:51,608
It's like Yeosu in Korea. 

74
00:02:51,608 --> 00:02:53,241
- Yes, it is. / - We've seen... 

75
00:02:53,241 --> 00:02:55,008
- Taipei. / - Kaohsiung and Taipei. 

76
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:57,474
- But Kenting is further south. / - Exactly. 

77
00:02:58,141 --> 00:02:59,441
Is it hotter there? 

78
00:02:59,808 --> 00:03:02,474
No, the weather was really nice. 

79
00:03:02,474 --> 00:03:05,041
It's not that far from Kaohsiung, is it? 

80
00:03:05,041 --> 00:03:07,041
It's about 2-hour drive. 

81
00:03:07,041 --> 00:03:08,741
- 2-hour drive? / - Yes. 

82
00:03:08,741 --> 00:03:11,141
Daejeon is not necessarily warmer than Seoul. 

83
00:03:11,141 --> 00:03:11,708
That's true. 

84
00:03:13,041 --> 00:03:14,174
But it's different. 

85
00:03:14,174 --> 00:03:16,741
- There's a difference. / - So, there's a direct flight... 

86
00:03:16,741 --> 00:03:18,674
To Kaohsiung and you have to drive from there? 

87
00:03:18,674 --> 00:03:21,441
- I see. / - Yes, you have to go a bit further. 

88
00:03:21,441 --> 00:03:23,508
It's a shame that there's no direct flight. 

89
00:03:23,508 --> 00:03:25,841
After 3 hours on a plane and 2 hours on a bus... 

90
00:03:25,841 --> 00:03:27,574
- You'll be exhausted. / - That's true. 

91
00:03:27,808 --> 00:03:29,074
- No. / - No, it's fine. 

92
00:03:29,074 --> 00:03:30,941
- You can look at the scenery on the ride. / - So tiring. 

93
00:03:30,941 --> 00:03:33,974
The sky and the buildings were so beautiful, 

94
00:03:33,974 --> 00:03:35,108
so we were busy enjoying the view. 

95
00:03:35,108 --> 00:03:35,908
You can definitely see the sky 

96
00:03:35,908 --> 00:03:36,908
once you lie down from exhaustion. 

97
00:03:38,141 --> 00:03:40,308
It was nice looking at the scenery out the window. 

98
00:03:40,308 --> 00:03:43,541
Is this place popular among Taiwanese people? 

99
00:03:43,541 --> 00:03:46,474
This place is comparable to Jeju-do. 

100
00:03:46,474 --> 00:03:48,541
- So it's a vacation spot. / - It's like Jeju-do. 

101
00:03:48,541 --> 00:03:49,608
- I see. / - The weather is nice... 

102
00:03:49,608 --> 00:03:50,674
And the air is clean. 

103
00:03:50,974 --> 00:03:52,408
The ocean is beautiful as well. 

104
00:03:52,408 --> 00:03:54,008
It's very blue. 

105
00:03:54,008 --> 00:03:56,674
It's where Taiwanese people go for vacation. 

106
00:03:57,441 --> 00:03:59,908
And Kenting is the first city to be designated 

107
00:03:59,908 --> 00:04:02,708
as a national park in Taiwan. 

108
00:04:02,708 --> 00:04:04,608
- That's amazing. / - It's very cheap there too. 

109
00:04:04,608 --> 00:04:06,674
- That sounds amazing. / - It does. 

110
00:04:06,674 --> 00:04:08,908
Taiwan is in the sub-tropical climate zone. 

111
00:04:08,908 --> 00:04:10,108
And Kenting is the only place 

112
00:04:10,108 --> 00:04:12,208
that has a tropical climate. 

113
00:04:12,208 --> 00:04:13,874
- Kenting. / - Yes, Kenting. 

114
00:04:13,874 --> 00:04:16,141
Because it has a beautiful sea, 

115
00:04:16,141 --> 00:04:19,374
many people come to surf and snorkel. 

116
00:04:19,374 --> 00:04:21,608
So it has a tropical sea. 

117
00:04:21,608 --> 00:04:24,208
- It'd seem so. / - Then... 

118
00:04:24,208 --> 00:04:26,074
You must have done some activities in the sea. 

119
00:04:26,074 --> 00:04:29,174
Yes, we did a lot of activities. 

120
00:04:29,174 --> 00:04:33,308
We found a perfect activity for us in the water there. 

121
00:04:33,308 --> 00:04:35,241
- Perfect? / - Did it go off? 

122
00:04:35,241 --> 00:04:36,841
- Yes, it was perfect for us. / - It did? 

123
00:04:36,841 --> 00:04:38,674
- It's going off. / - It goes off. 

124
00:04:38,674 --> 00:04:40,308
Are you a thrill seeker? 

125
00:04:40,308 --> 00:04:42,974
I'm scared of the water. 

126
00:04:42,974 --> 00:04:44,574
But I overcame that over there. 

127
00:04:45,241 --> 00:04:46,608
You overcame your fear of the water? 

128
00:04:47,408 --> 00:04:48,441
I'm not lying. 

129
00:04:49,174 --> 00:04:51,474
It's not easy to overcome the fear of water. 

130
00:04:51,474 --> 00:04:53,708
- It's not. / - It's because it was so fun. 

131
00:04:54,341 --> 00:04:57,274
Activities are good and all, 

132
00:04:57,274 --> 00:04:59,474
but Taiwan is known for having a lot of great foods. 

133
00:04:59,474 --> 00:05:00,908
How was it? 

134
00:05:00,908 --> 00:05:03,074
We usually don't like exotic spices 

135
00:05:03,074 --> 00:05:05,474
but Jisoo loved the food there. 

136
00:05:05,474 --> 00:05:06,774
- Really? / - Yes. 

137
00:05:06,774 --> 00:05:08,674
- The foods didn't smell exotic. / - I see. 

138
00:05:08,674 --> 00:05:11,041
All the foods were delicious. 

139
00:05:11,041 --> 00:05:13,741
I liked the savory dishes and rich soup. 

140
00:05:13,741 --> 00:05:15,174
You were lucky with the food choice. 

141
00:05:15,174 --> 00:05:17,974
Do you drink alcohol? 

142
00:05:18,408 --> 00:05:19,908
- We love drinking. / - Awesome. 

143
00:05:20,208 --> 00:05:22,274
Awesome! 

144
00:05:24,141 --> 00:05:25,208
The beach was nice, the weather was nice, 

145
00:05:25,208 --> 00:05:27,108
the food was nice and they had alcohol. 

146
00:05:27,108 --> 00:05:29,274
It really went off! 

147
00:05:29,974 --> 00:05:30,808
We won. 

148
00:05:31,608 --> 00:05:36,374
Let's check out Going Off Tour in Kenting, Taiwan! 

149
00:05:36,374 --> 00:05:37,574
Let's go. 

150
00:05:37,574 --> 00:05:39,674
(A trip to Kenting starts) 

151
00:05:39,674 --> 00:05:41,941
2,3. Hello, we are... 

152
00:05:41,941 --> 00:05:43,008
Lovelyz... 

153
00:05:43,408 --> 00:05:44,941
We really have terrible teamwork. 

154
00:05:44,941 --> 00:05:46,508
We should get the greeting right. 

155
00:05:46,508 --> 00:05:47,474
Let's just go with, "We are." 

156
00:05:47,474 --> 00:05:49,108
Ready, go. Hello! 

157
00:05:49,108 --> 00:05:52,008
- We're Lovelyz. I'm Mijoo. / - I'm Jisoo. 

158
00:05:54,941 --> 00:05:57,608
(A lovely group of 8, Lovelyz) 

159
00:05:58,508 --> 00:06:01,241
(Jisoo has a sweet voice) 

160
00:06:02,341 --> 00:06:05,308
(Mijoo has a refreshing voice) 

161
00:06:06,774 --> 00:06:07,708
(Whenever there is a camera) 

162
00:06:07,708 --> 00:06:08,941
What's going on? 

163
00:06:08,941 --> 00:06:10,141
Is that the way to work? 

164
00:06:11,208 --> 00:06:13,008
Mijoo is famous for posing creatively. 

165
00:06:13,308 --> 00:06:14,308
(What a funny girl) 

166
00:06:14,308 --> 00:06:15,908
(A charismatic model on the way to "Music Bank") 

167
00:06:16,808 --> 00:06:19,741
(When she poses for photos or takes them) 

168
00:06:20,308 --> 00:06:22,174
(She poses naturally like a model) 

169
00:06:22,308 --> 00:06:24,874
So our plan is... 

170
00:06:24,874 --> 00:06:26,841
Please spin the camera. 

171
00:06:26,841 --> 00:06:28,308
Exactly. Just like that. 

172
00:06:28,308 --> 00:06:30,408
(Passion that causes strain on her joints) 

173
00:06:32,408 --> 00:06:33,708
(Energetic attention seeker, Mijoo of Lovelyz) 

174
00:06:33,708 --> 00:06:35,441
I haven't seen her like this before. 

175
00:06:35,874 --> 00:06:37,474
She wasn't like that in the past. 

176
00:06:38,574 --> 00:06:40,608
It's cheaper to buy a round trip. 

177
00:06:41,108 --> 00:06:43,208
We have no licenses. 

178
00:06:43,208 --> 00:06:43,941
Okay? 

179
00:06:43,941 --> 00:06:46,641

- When Jisoo laughs, I don't. / - That's true. 

186
00:07:04,408 --> 00:07:06,441
The gap between them is getting bigger and bigger. 

187
00:07:07,474 --> 00:07:08,541
Let's get closer. 

188
00:07:09,374 --> 00:07:11,308

- If you haven't traveled either... / - That's right. 

194
00:07:23,408 --> 00:07:26,508
Since you both started working at a young age... 

195
00:07:26,508 --> 00:07:27,441
- They didn't have time. / - I see. 

196
00:07:27,441 --> 00:07:28,774
It was always my dream to travel.

- Taiwan is famous for their snacks. / - Right. 

205
00:07:46,908 --> 00:07:49,574
I had a lot bubble tea in Taiwan. 

206
00:07:49,574 --> 00:07:51,774
When we went to Taiwan... 

207
00:07:51,774 --> 00:07:53,674
- I had an ice cream. / - Yes. 

208

You're more interested in desserts. 

215
00:08:06,008 --> 00:08:07,774
Yes, I am. 

216
00:08:08,174 --> 00:08:11,208
When we were in Taiwan, there were so many fans. 

217
00:08:11,208 --> 00:08:14,374
- They dig the way we look over there. / - Right. 

218
00:08:14,374 --> 00:08:17,241
What if the people in Taiwan get so excited about us? 

219
00:08:17,541 --> 00:08:20,241

00:13:09,674 --> 00:13:11,608
It's so amazing that you can see that rock. 

344
00:13:11,608 --> 00:13:13,274
I agree. What do you think is over there? 

345
00:13:13,274 --> 00:13:15,708
It really feels like this is a painting. 

346
00:13:15,708 --> 00:13:17,474
(Follow the road to witness the beauty of Frog Rock) 

347
00:13:19,074 --> 00:13:20,541
This looks very Chinese. 

348
00:13:20,541 --> 00:13:22,241
It really does. 

349
00:13:22,241 --> 00:13:23,008
It was really pretty. 

350
00:13:23,008 --> 00:13:25,641
- It's like you're in a Chinese movie. / - Exactly. 

351
00:13:25,641 --> 00:13:26,641
It feels very traditional. 

352
00:13:27,908 --> 00:13:28,741
What is that? 

353
00:13:28,741 --> 00:13:30,408
- We saw that when we walked in. / - It's a table. 

354
00:13:31,441 --> 00:13:33,874
(A shared living room unfolds when they open the door) 

355
00:13:33,874 --> 00:13:36,108
- A shared living room? / - Yes, there are two rooms. 

356
00:13:36,108 --> 00:13:37,774
- It's really nice and clean. / - A shared living room. 

357
00:13:37,774 --> 00:13:39,408
- That's nice. / - Yes, indeed. 

358
00:13:39,408 --> 00:13:41,241
- Very traditional. / - You'd feel like you're on holiday. 

359
00:13:42,808 --> 00:13:44,174
Hey, Jisoo. 

360
00:13:49,574 --> 00:13:51,474
The inside of the house feels very different. 

361
00:13:51,474 --> 00:13:54,274
- Hey, I really like this place. / - It's going off. 

362
00:13:54,708 --> 00:13:56,374
(The lodging is going off) 

363
00:13:56,374 --> 00:13:58,908
- You're singers after all. / - That's right. 

364
00:13:58,908 --> 00:14:00,708
- They are funny. / - They're hilarious. 

365
00:14:01,208 --> 00:14:02,908
Good night, Battle Trip. 

366
00:14:03,941 --> 00:14:07,474
- We just arrived at our lodging. / - Yes. 

367
00:14:07,474 --> 00:14:10,941
- I researched. Let's rent scooters. / - What do we do? 

368
00:14:10,941 --> 00:14:13,141
- We can rent scooters and ride it. / - Scooters? 

369
00:14:13,141 --> 00:14:15,108
- We don't need a driver's license? / - No, we don't. 

370
00:14:15,874 --> 00:14:18,941
(They can drive along the most beautiful coastal road) 

371
00:14:19,341 --> 00:14:21,341
- We can ride scooters like that. / - Right. 

372
00:14:21,341 --> 00:14:22,908
- Look at the sky. / - Yes, it's really beautiful. 

373
00:14:22,908 --> 00:14:24,608
- The sky is beautiful. / - Look at the beach. 

374
00:14:24,841 --> 00:14:27,708
- The beach is beautiful. / - It's a tropical beach. 

375
00:14:27,708 --> 00:14:30,608
- It looks like Jeju-do. / - It does, doesn't it? 

376
00:14:30,608 --> 00:14:32,208
Riding on a motorbike. 

377
00:14:32,408 --> 00:14:34,074
People ride scooters more than 

378
00:14:34,074 --> 00:14:36,641
they ride taxis or buses. 

379
00:14:36,641 --> 00:14:37,741
To ride scooters, 

380
00:14:37,741 --> 00:14:40,941
we need to have a good sense of balance. 

381
00:14:40,941 --> 00:14:43,374
- Both of us can't ride bicycles. / - That's right. 

382
00:14:43,374 --> 00:14:45,741
- I'm not sure if we'll be okay. / - What do we do? 

383
00:14:45,741 --> 00:14:47,341
You don't know how to ride bicycles? 

384
00:14:47,341 --> 00:14:48,741
No, we can't ride two-wheelers. 

385
00:14:48,741 --> 00:14:50,208
I can ride one with training wheels. 

386
00:14:50,208 --> 00:14:51,274
Not the two-wheelers. 

387
00:14:52,241 --> 00:14:53,141
(They set out to rent scooters) 

388
00:14:53,141 --> 00:14:54,441
Look at the traffic light. 

389
00:14:54,941 --> 00:14:55,974
They're holding hands while walking. 

390
00:14:55,974 --> 00:14:58,574
- That's cute. / - The lights are very romantic. 

391
00:14:58,574 --> 00:15:00,541
- The traffic light is beautiful. / - Isn't it so romantic? 

392
00:15:00,541 --> 00:15:02,341
- Right? / - Let's hold hands. 

393
00:15:02,908 --> 00:15:04,008
- Just like this. / - What about the red light? 

394
00:15:04,441 --> 00:15:06,174
Yeah, what about the red light? 

395
00:15:06,174 --> 00:15:08,308
- It's so cute. / - We should check out the red light. 

396
00:15:08,308 --> 00:15:10,041
A couple is walking together. 

397
00:15:10,041 --> 00:15:11,174
What about the red light? 

398
00:15:12,174 --> 00:15:14,074
- They love each other. / - He's proposing to her. 

399
00:15:14,074 --> 00:15:16,841
Lots of people must go there for their honeymoon. 

400
00:15:16,841 --> 00:15:17,908
I guess so. 

401
00:15:18,774 --> 00:15:21,874
- We're here. / - Pictures on the scooters are cute. 

402
00:15:21,874 --> 00:15:23,274
- Right? / - Yes. 

403
00:15:24,308 --> 00:15:26,374
(They suddenly get excited after seeing the scooters) 

404
00:15:27,708 --> 00:15:31,074
(They get playful after seeing the scooters) 

405
00:15:33,074 --> 00:15:34,974
We have no licenses. 

406
00:15:34,974 --> 00:15:38,274
Okay, scooters don't need licenses. 

407
00:15:38,274 --> 00:15:40,874
- That's an electric scooter? / - Yes, that's why. 

408
00:15:41,541 --> 00:15:43,574
- Hence, you don't need a license. / - They're charged. 

409
00:15:43,574 --> 00:15:45,041
They charge scooters depending on the distance. 

410
00:15:45,041 --> 00:15:46,541
You must switch batteries for extra distance. 

411
00:15:46,541 --> 00:15:47,608
That's environmentally friendly. 

412
00:15:48,041 --> 00:15:49,108
I'm scared. 

413
00:15:49,108 --> 00:15:50,941
- They give you a training lesson. / - Yes. 

414
00:15:50,941 --> 00:15:52,574
They instruct us first. 

415
00:15:52,574 --> 00:15:54,741
(Their first time trying to ride scooters) 

416
00:15:55,874 --> 00:15:58,208
(Will she learn how to ride it successfully?) 

417
00:15:59,008 --> 00:16:00,008
(Screaming) 

418
00:16:01,241 --> 00:16:05,508
(She's practicing in an empty parking lot) 

419
00:16:06,408 --> 00:16:08,174
(She can't stay balanced) 

420
00:16:08,741 --> 00:16:10,374
I can't stay balanced. 

421
00:16:11,541 --> 00:16:13,008
(Meanwhile, what about Jisoo?) 

422
00:16:13,874 --> 00:16:16,208
(She's also struggling to stay balanced) 

423
00:16:16,374 --> 00:16:18,774
It was so hard to stay balanced. 

424
00:16:18,774 --> 00:16:20,474
She's struggling to stay balanced. 

425
00:16:20,474 --> 00:16:22,474
You couldn't balance it because you did this. 

426
00:16:22,974 --> 00:16:24,441
She couldn't balance the scooter. 

427
00:16:24,441 --> 00:16:25,774
(She can't control the scooter on her own) 

428
00:16:27,841 --> 00:16:30,408
(Jisoo fails to ride the scooter as well) 

429
00:16:30,408 --> 00:16:31,374
What do we do? 

430
00:16:31,374 --> 00:16:33,508
I think we'll hurt ourselves on the road. 

431
00:16:33,508 --> 00:16:35,274
- We definitely will. / - It's too much for us. 

432
00:16:35,274 --> 00:16:36,441
If we ride this on the roads, 

433
00:16:36,441 --> 00:16:38,774
we could get into a big accident. 

434
00:16:38,774 --> 00:16:42,474
Let's come back here after we get our licenses. 

435
00:16:42,474 --> 00:16:44,674
- We can't ride bicycles. / - Both of us can't ride. 

436
00:16:44,674 --> 00:16:47,541
- We can't ride this. / - We were meant to ride this... 

437
00:16:47,541 --> 00:16:51,041
Along the scenic road over there. That was my plan. 

438
00:16:51,041 --> 00:16:52,808
I had no idea it would be this hard. 

439
00:16:52,808 --> 00:16:56,808
Can't the camera directors drive us? 

440
00:16:56,808 --> 00:16:58,908
I really want to ride this. Can you do it for us? 

441
00:16:58,908 --> 00:17:00,241
They're asking for a big favor. 

442
00:17:01,341 --> 00:17:03,174
- They'll drive the scooters. / - They're so nice. 

443
00:17:03,174 --> 00:17:04,374
- They'll sit behind. / - Yes. 

444
00:17:04,374 --> 00:17:07,608
We had to act really cute for this. 

445
00:17:07,608 --> 00:17:09,941
- But they edited it all out. / - You're right. 

446
00:17:10,508 --> 00:17:12,141
- I'm sure there was a good reason. / - Must've overdid it. 

447
00:17:12,141 --> 00:17:13,374
- It must've been hard to watch. / - I guess so. 

448
00:17:13,374 --> 00:17:15,141
I'm sure they had a good reason to edit it out. 

449
00:17:15,141 --> 00:17:17,141
- Director... / - Director... 

450
00:17:17,141 --> 00:17:18,374
(It's better not to watch things like this) 

451
00:17:19,074 --> 00:17:21,141
Let's go. Move. 

452
00:17:22,008 --> 00:17:23,041
I wanted to drive it. 

453
00:17:23,041 --> 00:17:24,708
Seriously, it's quite a shame. 

454
00:17:25,708 --> 00:17:27,908
- Excuse me. / - Okay. 

455
00:17:29,641 --> 00:17:31,208
- Go. / - Hold on. 

456
00:17:32,941 --> 00:17:34,074
This is awesome. 

457
00:17:34,074 --> 00:17:35,508
(She looks the happiest) 

458
00:17:35,874 --> 00:17:37,808
- My goodness. / - I want to sit in the front. 

459
00:17:38,174 --> 00:17:39,241
Go! 

460
00:17:39,941 --> 00:17:41,074
This is fun. 

461
00:17:43,708 --> 00:17:47,841
(Riding to Longpan Park along the coastal road) 

462
00:17:50,708 --> 00:17:53,474
- Please go faster. / - This is amazing. 

463
00:17:53,474 --> 00:17:54,941
(But when they actually go faster) 

464
00:17:55,241 --> 00:17:57,174
(Screaming) 

465
00:17:57,174 --> 00:17:58,674
Riding on the scooter... 

466
00:17:58,674 --> 00:18:00,308
- You can really enjoy the view. / - Should've said... 

467
00:18:00,308 --> 00:18:01,508
"Go, honey." 

468
00:18:01,508 --> 00:18:02,608
I did say that. 

469
00:18:03,108 --> 00:18:05,041
"Go, honey!" 

470
00:18:05,041 --> 00:18:09,541
- She did say that, my goodness. / - What a surprise. 

471
00:18:09,541 --> 00:18:12,441
- "Go, honey!" / - She did say that. 

472
00:18:12,441 --> 00:18:15,241
Hello. Hi. 

473
00:18:16,474 --> 00:18:18,674
What's the speed limit for the electric scooters? 

474
00:18:18,674 --> 00:18:21,474
- Around 40kmph. / - I don't think I can ride that. 

475
00:18:21,474 --> 00:18:23,008
(They can see the beautiful beach face to face) 

476
00:18:23,008 --> 00:18:26,974
(As they ride along the coast) 

477
00:18:29,608 --> 00:18:31,508
Even the sky is so pretty. 

478
00:18:34,508 --> 00:18:36,541
It would've been more fun if we were driving. 

479
00:18:36,541 --> 00:18:39,208
- Yes, it would've been more fun. / - That's right. 

480
00:18:39,208 --> 00:18:41,041
That was a bit disappointing. 

481
00:18:41,041 --> 00:18:42,508
- Right. / - Yes, that was disappointing. 

482
00:18:42,508 --> 00:18:44,774
Let's come back with the rest of our members. 

483
00:18:47,441 --> 00:18:50,308
Go! 

484
00:18:50,308 --> 00:18:51,808
- It was so pretty. / - Yes, I bet. 

485
00:18:51,808 --> 00:18:54,441
The beauty couldn't be captured on a camera. 

486
00:18:54,441 --> 00:18:57,508
- Look at that. / - You'll end up in the clouds. 

487
00:18:57,508 --> 00:18:58,574
Isn't that pretty? 

488
00:18:58,574 --> 00:19:00,174
- It's beautiful. / - Yes, indeed. 

489
00:19:00,441 --> 00:19:02,108
The clouds and the sky look so beautiful together. 

490
00:19:02,108 --> 00:19:03,808
- The weather's so good. / - If you drive... 

491
00:19:03,808 --> 00:19:05,608
- You can't enjoy the scenery as well. / - Right. 

492
00:19:07,441 --> 00:19:09,174
Among all the clips of sky on our show... 

493
00:19:09,174 --> 00:19:12,074
- I think this is the best. / - It was so amazing. 

494
00:19:12,474 --> 00:19:14,941
You have to come here yourself. 

495
00:19:18,008 --> 00:19:23,274
(16 minutes to Longpan Park by scooter) 

496
00:19:24,608 --> 00:19:26,241
This is fun. 

497
00:19:27,441 --> 00:19:29,274
- Thank you for your help. / - Thank you. 

498
00:19:29,274 --> 00:19:31,641
Gosh, seriously. That was really fun. 

499
00:19:31,641 --> 00:19:33,241
It was so much fun. 

500
00:19:34,374 --> 00:19:37,174
(We have arrived at last!) 

501
00:19:39,941 --> 00:19:43,074
We're at Longpan Park now. 

502
00:19:43,074 --> 00:19:46,141
We can see the best scenery from this park. 

503
00:19:46,474 --> 00:19:48,241
It's a must-visit place in Kenting. 

504
00:19:48,708 --> 00:19:51,441
- It looks like Saipan. / - Doesn't this look great? 

505
00:19:51,441 --> 00:19:53,308
- The color of the beach is pretty. / - It's breezy there. 

506
00:19:53,674 --> 00:19:55,474
Isn't the ocean so blue? 

507
00:19:55,941 --> 00:19:57,174
The color of the water matches the color of the sky. 

508
00:19:57,174 --> 00:19:59,541
Yeah, I can't tell them apart. 

509
00:19:59,974 --> 00:20:02,841
This is crazy. The view here is crazy. 

510
00:20:05,008 --> 00:20:07,008
This is so beautiful. 

511
00:20:07,408 --> 00:20:09,341

Will it be tasty? 

624

I think it'll be good. 

625
00:24:25,774 --> 00:24:27,674
Though we have different tastes. 

626
00:24:27,841 --> 00:24:30,974
People from other countries come to Korea and say, 

627
00:24:30,974 --> 00:24:32,841

- Will you bring them? Okay. / - Okay. 

638
00:24:50,241 --> 00:24:51,941
You call her respectfully only at a time like this. 

639

- It's fun to order them around at times. / - Right. 

641

(Getting spicy sauce) 

643
00:25:00,108 --> 00:25:01,374
The sauce was unique. 

644
00:25:01,674 --> 00:25:02,874
I think it might spill over. 

645
00:25:03,308 --> 00:25:05,508
- Thanks. / - Let's try it. 

646
00:25:06,041 --> 00:25:07,174

00:25:15,474 --> 00:25:19,041
- It's garlic sauce and onion sauce. / - And onion. 

651
00:25:19,274 --> 00:25:20,708
Does it suit the Korean palate? 

652
00:25:20,708 --> 00:25:22,008
Yes, it was delicious. 

653
00:25:22,008 --> 00:25:24,108
That rice with duck was so good. 

654
00:25:25,141 --> 00:25:27,108
(Perfect for the Korean palate) 

655
00:25:27,274 --> 00:25:30,341
(She tries the duck rice) 

656
00:25:31,641 --> 00:25:32,808
What is it? 

657
00:25:33,541 --> 00:25:35,208
I didn't think it'd taste like this. 

658
00:25:35,208 --> 00:25:37,041
- Really? / - Try it. 

659
00:25:37,041 --> 00:25:39,341
(Jisoo takes a bite too) 

660
00:25:42,074 --> 00:25:44,741
It's like the onion chips. 

661
00:25:44,741 --> 00:25:49,141
It tastes like fried rice with onion and garlic. 

662
00:25:49,841 --> 00:25:51,441
After hearing what you said... 

663
00:25:52,208 --> 00:25:54,308
- It tastes like chips. / - Right? 

664
00:25:55,374 --> 00:25:57,808
- They put that in there. / - It's onion flakes. 

665
00:25:57,808 --> 00:26:00,741
- It's onions and garlic. / - Garlic. 

666
00:26:00,741 --> 00:26:02,441
They fried garlic and onion. 

667
00:26:02,441 --> 00:26:04,574
Because it has fried garlic and onion, 

668
00:26:04,574 --> 00:26:06,741
it suits the Korean palate. 

669
00:26:06,741 --> 00:26:08,341
It makes you want to eat more. 

670
00:26:08,341 --> 00:26:10,474
Yes, it's a flavor that makes me keep wanting more. 

671
00:26:11,274 --> 00:26:12,841
(Different parts of boiled duck meat) 

672
00:26:12,841 --> 00:26:15,608

Didn't you order beer? 

675

- No, not yet. / - Gosh. 

676
00:26:22,774 --> 00:26:25,708
- You have to have beer with that. / - My mistake. 

677
00:26:25,708 --> 00:26:29,374
(What does boiled duck taste like?) 

678
00:26:32,741 --> 00:26:35,374
- It tastes like pork hocks. / - It does. 

679
00:26:35,374 --> 00:26:37,941
It tastes like duck but it's just like pork hocks. 

680
00:26:37,941 --> 00:26:39,541
You're right. 

681
00:26:40,274 --> 00:26:41,941
How can it taste like this? It's interesting. 

682
00:26:43,141 --> 00:26:44,574
It doesn't smell strong. 

683
00:26:44,908 --> 00:26:46,208
I didn't even know it smelled. 

684
00:26:46,208 --> 00:26:47,808
Right. It just smells like meat. 

685
00:26:48,874 --> 00:26:50,041
(She takes the duck leg) 

686
00:26:50,041 --> 00:26:51,041
How is it? 

687
00:26:51,941 --> 00:26:55,641
(Chomping) 

688
00:26:56,608 --> 00:26:58,274
This one is chewy. 

689
00:26:58,808 --> 00:27:00,208
The skin is delicious. 

690
00:27:01,174 --> 00:27:03,441
- I like the texture of it. / - The texture? 

691
00:27:04,108 --> 00:27:06,274
- Duck feet. / - Duck feet. 

692
00:27:06,808 --> 00:27:07,874
(Here come the duck feet) 

693
00:27:07,874 --> 00:27:09,208
- Duck feet. / - Duck feet. 

694
00:27:09,208 --> 00:27:11,241
They're two for 50 cents. 

695
00:27:11,241 --> 00:27:12,941
(Two duck feet, 53 cents) 

696
00:27:12,941 --> 00:27:15,241
(The girls bravely try the duck feet) 

697
00:27:16,108 --> 00:27:17,908
(Mijoo tastes it first) 

698
00:27:18,541 --> 00:27:20,141
(Having a hard time) 

699
00:27:20,141 --> 00:27:22,774
- Is there anything to eat? / - You have to eat here. 

700
00:27:22,774 --> 00:27:24,608
Like Sikyung said, you should eat this part. 

701
00:27:24,608 --> 00:27:26,341
This part has meat. 

702
00:27:26,341 --> 00:27:27,708
You'd better use your hands. 

703
00:27:27,708 --> 00:27:28,941
(She fails) 

704
00:27:29,241 --> 00:27:30,308
No? 

705
00:27:30,774 --> 00:27:33,274
(She tries for the second time) 

706
00:27:33,774 --> 00:27:34,741
Chicken feet is like... 

707
00:27:34,741 --> 00:27:36,908
- Her face is awesome. / - This is crazy. 

708
00:27:37,441 --> 00:27:39,041
Pork rind... 

709
00:27:39,041 --> 00:27:40,274
Let's see who wins. 

710
00:27:42,141 --> 00:27:43,474
- Seriously, it's tough. / - Pork rind... 

711
00:27:46,541 --> 00:27:49,474
That means ducks are more active than chickens. 

712
00:27:49,474 --> 00:27:53,141
They're very chewy. The webbed feet is good. 

713
00:27:53,141 --> 00:27:55,474
- Webbed part? / - Yes, that part. 

714
00:27:55,474 --> 00:27:58,508

- You like chicken feet. / - It's chewy. 

717
00:28:01,708 --> 00:28:03,341
I like chicken feet. 

718
00:28:03,341 --> 00:28:05,308
Because it worked out a lot, the meat is tough. 

719
00:28:06,074 --> 00:28:07,308
So... 

720
00:28:08,241 --> 00:28:10,408
- It's chewy. / - You're right. 

721
00:28:10,408 --> 00:28:11,741
It's very elastic. 

722
00:28:12,008 --> 00:28:14,108
I think this will be good for your skin. 

723
00:28:14,108 --> 00:28:15,641
People who love chicken feet would love this. 

724
00:28:15,641 --> 00:28:16,408

00:28:17,174 --> 00:28:18,508
- I'm wondering... / - Yes. 

726
00:28:18,508 --> 00:28:20,874
If you can express what you've eaten so far 

727
00:28:20,874 --> 00:28:23,441
with your body. 

728
00:28:23,441 --> 00:28:26,774
I'll give a score to your menu. 

729
00:28:27,108 --> 00:28:28,908
(High expectation) 

730
00:28:30,074 --> 00:28:31,208
It's going off. 

731
00:28:31,441 --> 00:28:32,808
(They are embarrassed for her) 

732
00:28:34,074 --> 00:28:36,008
- This much. / - Really? 

733
00:28:36,408 --> 00:28:38,808
- It's not a high score. / - Not a high score? 

734
00:28:38,808 --> 00:28:40,474

735
00:28:40,474 --> 00:28:41,608
What about you?

It's pretty good. 

737
00:28:43,408 --> 00:28:44,541
(It's alright) 

738
00:28:44,908 --> 00:28:45,741
That's basic. 

739
00:28:45,741 --> 00:28:47,641
I wanted something different. 

740
00:28:47,641 --> 00:28:50,674
Don't they sell other things? 

741
00:28:50,674 --> 00:28:53,108
They have pig tail, tofu and other things. 

742
00:28:53,108 --> 00:28:54,541
- Pork rind too. / - Pig tail is delicious. 

743

I prepared this as a hidden card. 

746
00:29:02,308 --> 00:29:03,641
Night market. 

747
00:29:03,641 --> 00:29:05,974
- Let's go. / - Taiwan is famous for night markets. 

748
00:29:06,408 --> 00:29:08,041
Night market sounds good. 

749
00:29:08,041 --> 00:29:09,241
(Going Off Tour, Jisoo's Day) 

750
00:29:09,241 --> 00:29:13,774

- It has a great atmosphere. / - Right? 

752
00:29:16,508 --> 00:29:21,508

- There's so much food at night markets. / - True.

You can smell delicious food on the street.

Isn't it amazing? 

757
00:29:31,408 --> 00:29:32,974
This is my first time at a night market. 

758
00:29:32,974 --> 00:29:34,641
- Me too. / - I didn't think... 

759
00:29:34,641 --> 00:29:37,408
The night market was on a road like this. 

760
00:29:37,674 --> 00:29:40,641
- Is that the Kenting night market? / - Yes. 

761
00:29:40,908 --> 00:29:43,474
During the day, it's just a regular road. 

762
00:29:43,474 --> 00:29:46,874
- But it transforms at night. / - I see. 

763
00:29:47,874 --> 00:29:51,008

765
00:29:53,241 --> 00:29:54,408

767
00:29:56,341 --> 00:29:57,674
- Thank you. / - Thank you. 

768

Isn't it good? 

770
00:30:01,874 --> 00:30:04,208
(Mijoo will not watch what she eats today) 

771
00:30:05,241 --> 00:30:06,774

(They fry frozen milk) 

776
00:30:14,974 --> 00:30:16,074
Why doesn't it melt? 

777
00:30:16,408 --> 00:30:17,974
It melts in your mouth like cream. 

778
00:30:17,974 --> 00:30:20,508
- It's really sweet. / - That looks so good. 

779

(Jisoo takes a bite) 

789
00:30:52,274 --> 00:30:53,508
It's crispy. 

790
00:30:53,808 --> 00:30:55,408
But as soon as you bite it... 

791
00:30:55,908 --> 00:30:57,508
- It becomes liquid. / - You're right. 

792
00:30:58,074 --> 00:31:00,808
It's delicious. I get why this is famous here.

(At that time, they hear club music playing) 

795
00:31:05,674 --> 00:31:07,608
It's impossible for them not to dance. 

796
00:31:07,608 --> 00:31:08,508
(They fluster the locals) 

797

(Jisoo is going crazy because the food is hot) 

801
00:31:21,608 --> 00:31:23,808

805
00:31:32,074 --> 00:31:34,141
You have to keep moving while eating.

It was so fun. 

810

- It's not over yet. / - First trips are bound to be fun. 

812
00:31:50,108 --> 00:31:52,041

- One more, one more. / - One more. 

814
00:31:54,374 --> 00:31:55,841

- Spicy one. / - One. 

821

(She pulls out her secret weapon) 

822

(I'm prettier? Gosh, you have good eyes) 

837
00:32:47,574 --> 00:32:48,941

- High-five. Thank you. / - What's going on here? 

839
00:32:52,208 --> 00:32:54,174
Did you get drunk from the fried milk? 

840
00:32:55,108 --> 00:32:56,441
Did it contain alcohol? 

841
00:32:56,441 --> 00:32:58,541

- Yeah. / - It was plump and tasty. 

856
00:33:37,474 --> 00:33:39,741
The more white the fish cake is, the more tastier it is.

00:33:39,741 --> 00:33:41,174
- It's really chewy. / - At first... 

858

I thought it would be plain 

859
00:33:42,774 --> 00:33:46,474
but with the squid, its texture is chewy. 

860
00:33:46,874 --> 00:33:48,641
- The texture is great. / - You're right. 

861
00:33:49,074 --> 00:33:50,541
What else is famous here? 

862
00:33:50,541 --> 00:33:51,674
What else? 

863
00:33:51,674 --> 00:33:54,408
There's milk tea made with black sugar. 

864
00:33:54,408 --> 00:33:56,174
- Milk tea made with black sugar? / - Yes. 

865
00:33:56,174 --> 00:33:58,274
- It's bubble tea. / - Yes, it is. 

866
00:33:58,274 --> 00:33:59,574
I love bubble tea. 

867
00:34:00,308 --> 00:34:03,108
I could taste the boiled-down black sugar. 

868
00:34:03,108 --> 00:34:04,074
This is good. 

869
00:34:05,274 --> 00:34:06,574
(Sipping) 

870
00:34:07,874 --> 00:34:09,008
This isn't bad. 

871
00:34:09,008 --> 00:34:09,874
- Jisoo. / - Yes? 

872
00:34:10,608 --> 00:34:11,808
- Jisoo. / - Yes? 

873
00:34:12,308 --> 00:34:13,641
- Tell you what. / - Why are you calling me like that? 

874
00:34:13,641 --> 00:34:14,908
- You're making me nervous. / - A while ago... 

875
00:34:14,908 --> 00:34:16,741
- You're making me anxious. / - As we were walking... 

876
00:34:16,741 --> 00:34:18,608
I saw a massage shop. 

877
00:34:19,174 --> 00:34:20,541
Let's get a 10-minute massage. Gosh, my shoulders. 

878
00:34:20,541 --> 00:34:22,074
Hold on. Jisoo... 

879
00:34:22,074 --> 00:34:23,874
- There's a 10-minute massage? / - Yes. 

880
00:34:23,874 --> 00:34:25,474
- A 10-minute massage. / - Near the doctor fish? 

881
00:34:25,474 --> 00:34:25,974
Yes. 

882
00:34:26,508 --> 00:34:28,008
A 10-minute massage? 

883
00:34:28,008 --> 00:34:30,508
Yes, it was at the night market. 

884
00:34:30,508 --> 00:34:32,474
- My shoulders hurt a lot. / - When did you see it? 

885
00:34:32,474 --> 00:34:34,174
I'm in pain right now. 

886
00:34:34,808 --> 00:34:36,074
Jisoo. 

887
00:34:36,741 --> 00:34:37,908
I only call you nicely when I want something. 

888
00:34:38,341 --> 00:34:40,041
- Jisoo. / - Okay, let's check the price first. 

889
00:34:40,041 --> 00:34:41,708
- Where is it? Is it this one? / - Yes, it's this one. 

890
00:34:41,708 --> 00:34:43,074
Fine, I'll let you get one. 

891
00:34:43,608 --> 00:34:44,608
(She's utterly excited) 

892
00:34:44,608 --> 00:34:45,841
She's so happy. 

893
00:34:47,074 --> 00:34:49,074
- Does it hurt? / - He didn't start yet. 

894
00:34:49,074 --> 00:34:51,108
- Wow. Okay. / - What am I going to do? 

895
00:34:52,974 --> 00:34:54,474
Okay, okay. 

896
00:34:54,474 --> 00:34:56,641
- It's only for shoulders and neck? / - Yes. 

897
00:34:56,641 --> 00:34:58,608
- That's nice. / - You can request specific parts. 

898
00:34:58,608 --> 00:35:00,174
- I should get a massage. / - Yeah. 

899
00:35:00,174 --> 00:35:03,674
- It was nice that they had that there. / - Right? 

900
00:35:05,008 --> 00:35:06,174
Wait. 

901
00:35:07,674 --> 00:35:09,241
- Relax. / - Hey. 

902
00:35:09,241 --> 00:35:11,941
I can't believe that there's a massage shop here. 

903
00:35:12,708 --> 00:35:14,241
Thank you. Thank you. 

904
00:35:14,241 --> 00:35:16,274
(She's not cursing, she's thanking him) 

905
00:35:17,341 --> 00:35:18,974
- She's so funny. / - Mijoo, this was a good call. 

906
00:35:19,641 --> 00:35:20,908
Jisoo, I suggested this. I did it. 

907
00:35:20,908 --> 00:35:23,174
This is nice. Should we get 10 more minutes? 

908
00:35:24,341 --> 00:35:27,674
(10 minutes pass by in a blink of an eye) 

909
00:35:30,374 --> 00:35:32,308
- Thank you. / - Thank you. 

910
00:35:32,508 --> 00:35:34,974
- That was it. / - Which one of us is prettier? 

911
00:35:34,974 --> 00:35:37,108
Which one of us is prettier? 

912
00:35:37,474 --> 00:35:38,774
- You asked that to everyone? / - No! 

913
00:35:38,774 --> 00:35:39,908
- The massage was really good. / - One! 

914
00:35:39,908 --> 00:35:41,908
No! One! 

915
00:35:43,308 --> 00:35:44,874
(Jisoo got picked) 

916
00:35:44,874 --> 00:35:46,508
Oh, no. She's mad. 

917
00:35:46,508 --> 00:35:48,608
- Oh, dear. / - Oh, no. 

918
00:35:48,608 --> 00:35:50,408
- Oh, dear. / - What is she going to do? 

919
00:35:50,408 --> 00:35:51,874
- I can't watch this. / - Excuse me. 

920
00:35:51,874 --> 00:35:54,374
- This is so funny. / - Which one of us is prettier? 

921
00:35:56,308 --> 00:35:58,574
- She's angry. / - He picked the boss. 

922
00:35:58,574 --> 00:36:00,308
(Mijoo loses again) 

923
00:36:01,308 --> 00:36:03,374
Thank you. Thank you. 

924
00:36:03,374 --> 00:36:04,708
- Thank you. / - Okay. 

925
00:36:04,708 --> 00:36:07,608
She asked until someone chose her. 

926
00:36:08,441 --> 00:36:11,108
We can have raw shrimp here. 

927
00:36:11,108 --> 00:36:12,208
- Really? Where? / - Yes. 

928
00:36:12,208 --> 00:36:13,741
It's right here. 

929
00:36:13,974 --> 00:36:15,074
(5 raw shrimps, $7) 

930
00:36:15,074 --> 00:36:17,574
5 shrimps cost about $7. 

931
00:36:17,808 --> 00:36:19,574
- It's really cheap. / - It's so cheap. 

932
00:36:19,574 --> 00:36:21,508
They raise the shrimps themselves. 

933
00:36:21,508 --> 00:36:24,074
- They do? / - They raise shrimps themselves. 

934
00:36:24,508 --> 00:36:26,374
(They cook them right on the spot) 

935
00:36:26,374 --> 00:36:27,908
- The shrimps were strong. / - They're jumping. 

936
00:36:27,908 --> 00:36:29,741
They raise the shrimps themselves. 

937
00:36:29,741 --> 00:36:31,908
- The shrimps were really fresh. / - My goodness. 

938
00:36:32,308 --> 00:36:33,541
I'd like to order. 

939
00:36:35,574 --> 00:36:36,541
These two, please. 

940
00:36:36,541 --> 00:36:37,708
(Garlic stir-fried shrimp, grilled shrimp on salt) 

941
00:36:38,974 --> 00:36:40,808
That looks really good. 

942
00:36:40,808 --> 00:36:42,174
- You ate that without beer? / - That's salt. 

943
00:36:42,174 --> 00:36:43,108
- No, we both had one. / - Coarse salt. 

944
00:36:43,108 --> 00:36:46,174
- Beer was a given. / - Really? Well done. 

945
00:36:46,174 --> 00:36:48,108
- We had it with draft beer. / - There's a big one. 

946
00:36:48,308 --> 00:36:50,608
- Oh, no. / - You know what? 

947
00:36:51,174 --> 00:36:53,141
- I love grilled shrimp on salt. / - I do too. 

948
00:36:53,374 --> 00:36:55,408
- They'll jump around, right? / - Probably. 

949
00:36:56,141 --> 00:36:57,641
They must know what's happening. 

950
00:36:57,641 --> 00:36:59,074
- It looks delicious though. / - Mijoo. 

951
00:37:00,074 --> 00:37:04,008
(A big scoop of garlic into the oil) 

952
00:37:05,641 --> 00:37:07,474
(Sizzling) 

953
00:37:12,508 --> 00:37:14,741
It wasn't spicy. It was delicious. 

954
00:37:14,741 --> 00:37:16,774
- It was sweet, actually. / - The spiciness from garlic... 

955
00:37:16,774 --> 00:37:17,841
I want to eat that. 

956
00:37:18,208 --> 00:37:19,874
It's not the same spiciness from chili powder. 

957
00:37:19,874 --> 00:37:21,174
I really want to eat that. 

958
00:37:21,174 --> 00:37:22,608
It was to die for. 

959
00:37:22,608 --> 00:37:23,774
- That's the best. / - My Gosh. 

960
00:37:23,774 --> 00:37:25,041
My goodness. 

961
00:37:25,908 --> 00:37:27,208
(Battle Trip Part 2 will be aired soon) 

962
00:37:27,208 --> 00:37:28,741
- That looks amazing. / - I bet it smelled divine. 

963
00:37:28,741 --> 00:37:31,108
- The smell of garlic was awesome. / - Of course. 

964
00:37:31,108 --> 00:37:32,374
The beer! 

965
00:37:33,293 --> 00:37:35,459
(Sizzling) 

966
00:37:40,426 --> 00:37:42,893
It wasn't spicy. It was delicious. 

967
00:37:42,893 --> 00:37:44,659
- It was sweet, actually. / - Spiciness from garlic... 

968
00:37:44,659 --> 00:37:46,126
I want to eat that. 

969
00:37:46,126 --> 00:37:47,859
It's different from the spiciness from chili powder. 

970
00:37:47,859 --> 00:37:49,193
I really want to eat that. 

971
00:37:49,193 --> 00:37:50,526
It was to die for. 

972
00:37:50,526 --> 00:37:51,593
- That's the best. / - Wow. 

973
00:37:51,593 --> 00:37:52,859
(Shrimps cooked to a nice red color) 

974
00:37:55,093 --> 00:37:56,793
- That looks amazing. / - I bet it smelled divine. 

975
00:37:56,793 --> 00:37:58,993
- The smell of the garlic was awesome. / - Yes. 

976
00:37:58,993 --> 00:38:00,393
- Beer! / - Exactly. 

977
00:38:01,159 --> 00:38:02,593
- "I'm sorry, shrimp." / - "I'm sorry, shrimp." 

978
00:38:02,593 --> 00:38:06,159
- Do you have beer? / - Beer? 

979
00:38:06,159 --> 00:38:08,026
(They don't sell beer) 

980
00:38:08,559 --> 00:38:10,826
(You can drink beer over there) 

981
00:38:11,459 --> 00:38:13,959
- Thank you. / - That must be the sign for the beer. 

982
00:38:14,526 --> 00:38:16,493
(Jisoo happily pays for the meal) 

983
00:38:16,893 --> 00:38:18,926
- Let's go find beer. / - Okay. 

984
00:38:18,926 --> 00:38:20,859
Is it that stall? 

985
00:38:20,859 --> 00:38:22,826
You can take your shrimp and eat it there? 

986
00:38:22,826 --> 00:38:24,593
- Yes. / - That's nice. 

987
00:38:24,593 --> 00:38:25,593
You can take your food and drink beer there. 

988
00:38:25,593 --> 00:38:27,393
You can buy food and eat it there? 

989
00:38:28,393 --> 00:38:29,759
(Shrimp dishes and beer, $7 each) 

990
00:38:29,759 --> 00:38:30,959
- That looks good. / - Right. 

991
00:38:31,926 --> 00:38:34,126
- I was about to get frustrated. / - I know. 

992
00:38:34,359 --> 00:38:38,093
(The cool beer quenches their thirst) 

993
00:38:38,093 --> 00:38:39,259
This is so good. 

994
00:38:39,259 --> 00:38:40,659
(It picks up her mood) 

995
00:38:40,659 --> 00:38:42,459
This is good. It's good. 

996
00:38:42,459 --> 00:38:43,993
- Should we start eating? / - Thank you for the food. 

997
00:38:43,993 --> 00:38:44,826
Thank you for the food. 

998
00:38:45,293 --> 00:38:46,626
Should we eat the original first? 

999
00:38:47,093 --> 00:38:48,659
Grilled shrimp is very affordable. 

1000
00:38:48,659 --> 00:38:50,859
- Yes, $7 for each dish. / - $7 each. 

1001
00:38:50,859 --> 00:38:53,493
$7? Since it's near the beach. 

1002
00:38:53,493 --> 00:38:55,259
It's an island. 

1003
00:38:55,259 --> 00:38:56,859
I bet it's delicious. 

1004
00:38:57,759 --> 00:38:59,426
Hey, this one is plump. 

1005
00:39:00,826 --> 00:39:02,593
- Peeling them is fun too. / - It must be so good. 

1006
00:39:02,593 --> 00:39:04,193
- It was really delicious. / - It was so good. 

1007
00:39:04,193 --> 00:39:05,859
- It was plump too. / - Right. 

1008
00:39:05,859 --> 00:39:09,059
People who live near the beach eat the shells too. 

1009
00:39:09,059 --> 00:39:10,126
- They do. / - That's true. 

1010
00:39:10,126 --> 00:39:11,759
Even when eaten as a whole, it was so good. 

1011
00:39:11,759 --> 00:39:12,893
Sweet and tasty. 

1012
00:39:13,993 --> 00:39:16,159
The shrimps are so plump. 

1013
00:39:16,159 --> 00:39:18,326
It was grilled with salt but it's not that salty. 

1014
00:39:18,326 --> 00:39:20,393
The saltiness is just perfect. It's savory. 

1015
00:39:20,393 --> 00:39:21,793
Yes, you must eat the head. 

1016
00:39:23,426 --> 00:39:25,826
- The sauce in the head... / - You must eat the head. 

1017
00:39:25,826 --> 00:39:27,959
When you eat that... 

1018
00:39:27,959 --> 00:39:29,826
That's worth the entire shrimp. 

1019
00:39:29,826 --> 00:39:31,226
(The flavor calls for beer) 

1020
00:39:33,426 --> 00:39:34,493
This is going off. 

1021
00:39:40,626 --> 00:39:42,793
(With beer, this is paradise) 

1022
00:39:42,793 --> 00:39:43,793
This is a paradise. 

1023
00:39:44,093 --> 00:39:46,759
One must drink beer at night markets. 

1024
00:39:46,959 --> 00:39:48,393
- The moment you drink it... / - I know the feeling. 

1025
00:39:48,393 --> 00:39:51,026
- You have no worries. / - You're right. 

1026
00:39:51,026 --> 00:39:52,859
I felt like we were there alone. 

1027
00:39:52,859 --> 00:39:56,093
- It looks good. / - We can get drunk without beer. 

1028
00:39:57,793 --> 00:40:00,259
You can get drunk on the mood and the music. 

1029
00:40:00,259 --> 00:40:01,459
We can get drunk. 

1030
00:40:01,826 --> 00:40:02,926
I wonder what this would taste like. 

1031
00:40:02,926 --> 00:40:05,759
(Stir-fried shrimp with garlic) 

1032
00:40:07,159 --> 00:40:12,793
(The very look of it makes your mouth water) 

1033
00:40:14,126 --> 00:40:15,659
- It tastes good with beer. / - This is amazing. 

1034
00:40:15,659 --> 00:40:16,659
(She takes a piece to her mouth) 

1035
00:40:16,959 --> 00:40:18,459
This is really delicious. 

1036
00:40:19,726 --> 00:40:22,693
- Garlic is sweet when it's cooked. / - That's true. 

1037
00:40:23,293 --> 00:40:25,959
(She tastes a piece of garlic) 

1038
00:40:27,059 --> 00:40:29,826
I just ate a whole piece of garlic. 

1039
00:40:30,026 --> 00:40:33,726
It's delicious. Do you know garlic pork hocks? 

1040
00:40:34,393 --> 00:40:38,093
The garlic they use for that is finely mashed. 

1041
00:40:38,393 --> 00:40:41,426
But here, you can chew on the garlic. 

1042
00:40:41,426 --> 00:40:42,726
However, it's not spicy. 

1043
00:40:42,726 --> 00:40:45,293
It's not spicy at all. It goes nicely with the shrimp. 

1044
00:40:45,693 --> 00:40:47,159
- This one? / - Was it tasty? 

1045
00:40:47,159 --> 00:40:49,126
- It was really good. / - It was sweet. 

1046
00:40:49,559 --> 00:40:52,493
When small snacks like this add up, 

1047
00:40:52,493 --> 00:40:55,459
the total price becomes quite high. 

1048
00:40:55,459 --> 00:40:56,559
Of course. 

1049
00:40:56,559 --> 00:41:00,893
What was your favorite food here? On the count of 3. 

1050
00:41:00,893 --> 00:41:02,493
1, 2, 3. 

1051
00:41:02,493 --> 00:41:03,426
- Shrimp! / - Shrimp! 

1052
00:41:03,993 --> 00:41:06,859
I think it's a good idea to order these 2 dishes. 

1053
00:41:06,859 --> 00:41:09,693
- And beer as well. / - They're a perfect match. 

1054
00:41:09,693 --> 00:41:11,226
I love this. 

1055
00:41:12,093 --> 00:41:13,893
I love the night of Taiwan. 

1056
00:41:14,459 --> 00:41:16,459
I'm going to miss this place once we leave. 

1057
00:41:16,459 --> 00:41:17,459
Right? 

1058
00:41:17,459 --> 00:41:20,793
It was a spectacular day today. 

1059
00:41:20,793 --> 00:41:22,893
I'm happy I planned the trip 

1060
00:41:22,893 --> 00:41:24,593
and did all the things I wanted to do. 

1061
00:41:24,593 --> 00:41:30,793
And it's meaningful to me that I did it with you. 

1062
00:41:30,793 --> 00:41:32,293
- With me? / - With you. 

1063
00:41:33,359 --> 00:41:34,759
It's meaningful to me. 

1064
00:41:35,359 --> 00:41:36,726
Cheers. 

1065
00:41:36,726 --> 00:41:37,859
Jisoo. 

1066
00:41:38,793 --> 00:41:39,893
What is it? 

1067
00:41:39,893 --> 00:41:41,526
I love you. 

1068
00:41:41,526 --> 00:41:42,959
You didn't look me in the eyes as you said that. 

1069
00:41:42,959 --> 00:41:44,659
No, I couldn't. 

1070
00:41:45,659 --> 00:41:49,126
- Going Off Tour! Let's go! / - Let's go! 

1071
00:41:49,126 --> 00:41:50,993
(So excited) 

1072
00:41:53,759 --> 00:41:54,793
You guys can leave first. 

1073
00:41:54,793 --> 00:41:55,993
We'll hang out here a little more. 

1074
00:41:55,993 --> 00:41:57,626
- We'll hang out more. / - Thank you. 

1075
00:41:57,626 --> 00:42:00,293
- We have many places to go. / - I'll clap the slate. 

1076
00:42:00,293 --> 00:42:01,793
- 1, 2, 3. / - Where are you going? 

1077
00:42:01,793 --> 00:42:03,359
- We went to hang out. / - To hang out. 

1078
00:42:04,226 --> 00:42:06,126
Goodness, where are they going? 

1079
00:42:06,126 --> 00:42:07,193
You went to a club, didn't you? 

1080
00:42:09,059 --> 00:42:09,926
(Today, Mijoo is the elder) 

1081
00:42:09,926 --> 00:42:11,493
I'm the elder today. 

1082
00:42:11,493 --> 00:42:13,826
Hello, ma'am. To tell you about this place... 

1083
00:42:13,826 --> 00:42:16,059
Oh, Mijoo. 

1084
00:42:16,926 --> 00:42:19,693
- What is that? / - This is so much fun. 

1085
00:42:20,459 --> 00:42:22,526
- My goodness. / - You're wearing mermaid tails. 

1086
00:42:22,526 --> 00:42:25,226
- We were mermaids. / - Is that a swimming suit? 

1087
00:42:25,526 --> 00:42:28,759
Hengchun 3000 Brewseum. 

1088
00:42:29,193 --> 00:42:30,959
- There's a beer museum too? / - It's so good. 

1089
00:42:30,959 --> 00:42:32,059
A beer museum? 

1090
00:42:33,726 --> 00:42:34,759
Beef noodle soup. 

1091
00:42:36,793 --> 00:42:39,159
- That looks so good. / - Beef noodle soup. 

1092
00:42:39,159 --> 00:42:40,226
(Precious time in Kenting) 

1093
00:42:40,226 --> 00:42:41,726
- We are... / - Going off! 

1094
00:42:41,726 --> 00:42:44,526
- Yeah! Go! / - It's going off! 

1095
00:42:46,393 --> 00:42:47,926
- Are you swimming? / - Yes. 

1096
00:42:49,259 --> 00:42:52,093
(The sun rises in Kenting) 

1097
00:42:57,259 --> 00:42:58,926
I love this lodging. 

1098
00:42:58,926 --> 00:43:00,526
I like it too. 

1099
00:43:00,526 --> 00:43:01,593
It was very comfortable. 

1100
00:43:01,593 --> 00:43:04,959
(Mermaid experience) 

1101
00:43:05,026 --> 00:43:06,493
Mermaid experience. 

1102
00:43:06,493 --> 00:43:08,159
- Mermaid experience? / - Yes. 

1103
00:43:08,159 --> 00:43:09,359
What is a mermaid experience? 

1104
00:43:09,359 --> 00:43:10,626
Hey, check this out. 

1105
00:43:11,126 --> 00:43:12,693
Mermaid experience. 

1106
00:43:12,693 --> 00:43:14,126
This must be that... 

1107
00:43:14,126 --> 00:43:16,059
(It's a special activity in Kenting) 

1108
00:43:16,059 --> 00:43:17,059
It looks pretty. 

1109
00:43:17,659 --> 00:43:18,859
Is that you two? 

1110
00:43:18,859 --> 00:43:21,426
- You have to swim well. / - No, it's not us. 

1111
00:43:21,926 --> 00:43:24,959
With just the top and the tail, it looks really sexy. 

1112
00:43:24,959 --> 00:43:27,159
- Let's do this. / - It looks fun. 

1113
00:43:27,159 --> 00:43:28,359
I like it. 

1114
00:43:28,359 --> 00:43:30,826
I want to give myself a challenge. 

1115
00:43:30,826 --> 00:43:33,193
I want to get over my fear of water. 

1116
00:43:33,193 --> 00:43:34,493
Jisoo, you said you're scared of water. 

1117
00:43:34,493 --> 00:43:37,859
Yes, I'm scared of water. I almost drowned as a kid. 

1118
00:43:37,859 --> 00:43:38,726
But I overcame it. 

1119
00:43:39,326 --> 00:43:40,459
- Jisoo. / - Yes. 

1120
00:43:41,059 --> 00:43:42,993
Today, I'm the elder. 

1121
00:43:42,993 --> 00:43:44,426
- Okay. / - Show some respect. 

1122
00:43:44,426 --> 00:43:45,659
Okay, Mijoo. 

1123
00:43:45,659 --> 00:43:48,459
We're going to take pictures in mermaid costumes. 

1124
00:43:48,459 --> 00:43:49,826
Shouldn't we practice first? 

1125
00:43:49,826 --> 00:43:52,493
We should work on our poses to look pretty. 

1126
00:43:52,493 --> 00:43:55,426
Like this. 

1127
00:43:55,426 --> 00:43:57,093
(How do I look?) 

1128
00:43:57,326 --> 00:43:59,293
I should get going first. 

1129
00:44:00,593 --> 00:44:01,859
Be bold. 

1130
00:44:01,859 --> 00:44:05,326
Like a mermaid, you don't have a voice but have legs. 

1131
00:44:06,226 --> 00:44:07,426
Hello, Jisoo. 

1132
00:44:10,926 --> 00:44:12,293
(Mijoo is excited as always) 

1133
00:44:12,293 --> 00:44:14,393
Jisoo looks a little embarrassed. 

1134
00:44:14,693 --> 00:44:17,026
- Like this. / - I don't want to be a mermaid now. 

1135
00:44:21,659 --> 00:44:23,926
(It takes 10 minutes by foot) 

1136
00:44:24,059 --> 00:44:25,959
(Mermaid experience, from 9 a.m. till 2 p.m., $122.50) 

1137
00:44:25,959 --> 00:44:27,826
$120? Yes! 

1138
00:44:27,826 --> 00:44:33,059
- It's a little expensive... / - $120? 

1139
00:44:33,059 --> 00:44:34,659
Photo shoots and video editing are all included. 

1140
00:44:34,659 --> 00:44:36,326
After saving money on food... 

1141
00:44:40,793 --> 00:44:42,793
(Here come the amazing girls) 

1142
00:44:44,393 --> 00:44:46,226
- Anything you want to say? / - Anything to say? 

1143
00:44:46,226 --> 00:44:47,826
- Do we look pretty? / - She has too much bounce. 

1144
00:44:47,826 --> 00:44:50,193
Yes, we do! How much? 

1145
00:44:50,193 --> 00:44:51,693
This much! 

1146
00:44:56,693 --> 00:44:58,193
I'm so excited. 

1147
00:44:58,326 --> 00:44:59,593
Okay. 

1148
00:45:01,093 --> 00:45:02,759
- Hello. / - Hello. 

1149
00:45:02,759 --> 00:45:03,759
- Hello. / - Thank you. 

1150
00:45:03,759 --> 00:45:06,093
- Oh, my. / - She must be the Little Mermaid. 

1151
00:45:06,093 --> 00:45:07,193
She must be. 

1152
00:45:07,193 --> 00:45:10,159
I will teach you how to swim like a mermaid. 

1153
00:45:10,493 --> 00:45:13,926
- So, just like... Wave. / - Oh, my. 

1154
00:45:13,926 --> 00:45:17,826
Body wave. Lovelyz are experts at that. 

1155
00:45:19,359 --> 00:45:20,126
It's like... 

1156
00:45:20,126 --> 00:45:22,359
I didn't know there would be a mermaid teacher. 

1157
00:45:23,859 --> 00:45:25,293
(She can do amazing body waves) 

1158
00:45:25,293 --> 00:45:26,893
Unbelievable. 

1159
00:45:28,093 --> 00:45:30,093
(Stiff) 

1160
00:45:30,093 --> 00:45:31,493
I'm so stiff. 

1161
00:45:33,626 --> 00:45:35,026
But you're an idol. 

1162
00:45:35,193 --> 00:45:36,693
- I didn't expect this. / - My body is very... 

1163
00:45:36,693 --> 00:45:39,059
- You can't do the wave? / - I'm actually quite stiff. 

1164
00:45:40,626 --> 00:45:43,693
(Mijoo does it pretty well) 

1165
00:45:44,459 --> 00:45:45,993
- Okay. / - Am I good? 

1166
00:45:45,993 --> 00:45:47,726
Now we're finished with the practice. 

1167
00:45:47,726 --> 00:45:52,326
Where is... Little Mermaid... Princess costumes? 

1168
00:45:52,326 --> 00:45:54,526
- Okay, let's go. / - What did that mean? 

1169
00:45:54,526 --> 00:45:56,493
- How did she understand? / - She understood it all. 

1170
00:45:56,493 --> 00:45:57,493
How did she understand that? 

1171
00:45:57,493 --> 00:45:58,759
This is interesting. 

1172
00:45:58,759 --> 00:46:00,693
(Turning into mermaids) 

1173
00:46:02,693 --> 00:46:04,093
Does she help us put it on? 

1174
00:46:04,093 --> 00:46:04,626
Goodness. 

1175
00:46:04,626 --> 00:46:07,159
I guess she has to help you get into that. 

1176
00:46:07,159 --> 00:46:09,226
You can choose the color of the tail. 

1177
00:46:09,226 --> 00:46:11,026
(Laughing) 

1178
00:46:13,026 --> 00:46:14,493
(Floundering) 

1179
00:46:21,359 --> 00:46:22,593
That's why it looked familiar. 

1180
00:46:23,026 --> 00:46:24,393
That was excellent editing. 

1181
00:46:24,393 --> 00:46:25,426
That was so good. 

1182
00:46:26,293 --> 00:46:28,393
(She managed to put on the mermaid costume) 

1183
00:46:28,393 --> 00:46:30,626
She's not a mermaid. She's a rockfish. 

1184
00:46:30,726 --> 00:46:31,893
I'm a flatfish. 

1185
00:46:31,893 --> 00:46:34,193
- A flatfish? / - She's a flatfish. 

1186
00:46:34,559 --> 00:46:35,759
Wait, wait. 

1187
00:46:36,159 --> 00:46:37,926
(Let me get ready) 

1188
00:46:41,426 --> 00:46:43,493
(How does Mijoo look in the photo?) 

1189
00:46:45,359 --> 00:46:47,059
(Forget the flatfish) 

1190
00:46:47,059 --> 00:46:48,059
She looks great in the picture. 

1191
00:46:49,259 --> 00:46:50,959
As long as you look nice in the photo. 

1192
00:46:50,959 --> 00:46:53,159
You can pick the color of the tail, right? 

1193
00:46:53,159 --> 00:46:54,659
- Yes. / - Yes, we picked them ourselves. 

1194
00:46:55,359 --> 00:46:57,426
You look so pretty in it. 

1195
00:46:58,959 --> 00:47:00,626
- That's a pretty picture. / - Wow. 

1196
00:47:01,793 --> 00:47:03,793
(She helps her with the pose) 

1197
00:47:04,893 --> 00:47:06,959
(Satisfied) 

1198
00:47:08,426 --> 00:47:10,026
You got some great photos. 

1199
00:47:10,026 --> 00:47:12,093
- Yes. / - They take videos of you too. 

1200
00:47:12,093 --> 00:47:14,059
This is why it's a little pricey. 

1201
00:47:14,393 --> 00:47:16,993
- They even edit the video for you? / - Yes. 

1202
00:47:16,993 --> 00:47:19,226
The photo, video shooting and costume hire. 

1203
00:47:20,326 --> 00:47:22,693
She must be taking a video now. That's amazing. 

1204
00:47:23,193 --> 00:47:24,726
They even teach you how to pose. 

1205
00:47:25,726 --> 00:47:27,059
It's like a magazine cover. 

1206
00:47:27,059 --> 00:47:29,193
Like this? Do I look okay? 

1207
00:47:29,193 --> 00:47:30,226
- Jisoo. / - Yes. 

1208
00:47:30,793 --> 00:47:31,959
I feel like raw fish. 

1209
00:47:33,293 --> 00:47:35,226
- I have a lot of fat. / - Do you? 

1210
00:47:35,226 --> 00:47:37,126
- You'll taste good then. / - Real good. 

1211
00:47:37,859 --> 00:47:39,659
- Like... Lay. / - Lay? 

1212
00:47:40,493 --> 00:47:42,093
Imagine you're a princess. 

1213
00:47:42,093 --> 00:47:42,859
Yes. 

1214
00:47:42,859 --> 00:47:45,559
- What is this? / - Is this a penalty? 

1215
00:47:46,926 --> 00:47:47,959
(This is hilarious) 

1216
00:47:49,226 --> 00:47:51,193
Is this a penalty? 

1217
00:47:51,193 --> 00:47:54,293
(It's suddenly become a military drill) 

1218
00:47:55,659 --> 00:47:57,093
This is so funny. 

1219
00:47:58,059 --> 00:47:59,759
(Mermaid drill in Kenting) 

1220
00:48:02,959 --> 00:48:04,726
- This one is nice. / - This one is good. 

1221
00:48:05,993 --> 00:48:07,526
They take all the pictures for you. 

1222
00:48:07,526 --> 00:48:08,793
Right. 

1223
00:48:08,793 --> 00:48:09,859
There's a deep section. 

1224
00:48:09,859 --> 00:48:11,826
You take pictures underwater. 

1225
00:48:12,859 --> 00:48:14,626
- I'm scared. / - Do I look like that too? 

1226
00:48:14,626 --> 00:48:16,093
It must be scary. 

1227
00:48:16,593 --> 00:48:18,593
- It's because your feet are tied together. / - Right. 

1228
00:48:18,593 --> 00:48:19,593
That's true. 

1229
00:48:19,593 --> 00:48:21,226
How does it feel to be up here? 

1230
00:48:21,959 --> 00:48:25,626
I miss my parents and members. 

1231
00:48:25,626 --> 00:48:27,293
- Can you do this? / - When was that? 

1232
00:48:27,293 --> 00:48:29,293
I think that was 2 years ago. 

1233
00:48:33,326 --> 00:48:34,426
It's cool in here. 

1234
00:48:36,593 --> 00:48:38,126
Wait, wait, wait. 

1235
00:48:41,659 --> 00:48:44,393
(Hard to balance in the tail) 

1236
00:48:44,826 --> 00:48:47,693
Swim and breathe. 

1237
00:48:47,993 --> 00:48:50,893
Turn and breathe. 

1238
00:48:51,959 --> 00:48:53,959
(Nervous) 

1239
00:48:53,959 --> 00:48:56,359
I know how to swim but with my feet tied... 

1240
00:48:56,359 --> 00:48:57,759
- I don't think I can do it. / - It's hard. 

1241
00:48:57,759 --> 00:48:59,059
It was hard to get out. 

1242
00:48:59,059 --> 00:49:00,726
We both can't swim. 

1243
00:49:00,726 --> 00:49:01,793
- You can't? / - No. 

1244
00:49:01,793 --> 00:49:02,893
But if you could do it, 

1245
00:49:02,893 --> 00:49:05,059
it means people who can't swim can do this as well. 

1246
00:49:05,059 --> 00:49:07,059
- That's right. / - It looks so pretty. 

1247
00:49:07,259 --> 00:49:09,593
(The instructor will demonstrate) 

1248
00:49:13,559 --> 00:49:14,926
That's so pretty. 

1249
00:49:14,926 --> 00:49:16,759
That man is so flexible. 

1250
00:49:16,759 --> 00:49:19,126
But he's not wearing a tail. 

1251
00:49:19,859 --> 00:49:22,526
He's not wearing the mermaid suit. 

1252
00:49:24,026 --> 00:49:25,959
See? You can't stand in that suit. 

1253
00:49:25,959 --> 00:49:28,759
Still, it was so brave of you to give it a try. 

1254
00:49:28,759 --> 00:49:31,993
- Such things are hard to overcome. / - It was. 

1255
00:49:31,993 --> 00:49:34,026
Why don't you two try that mermaid experience? 

1256
00:49:34,793 --> 00:49:36,259
- I strongly recommend it. / - You want to try? 

1257
00:49:36,293 --> 00:49:37,293
- It was so fun. / - No... 

1258
00:49:37,293 --> 00:49:38,926
(They can't be mermaids if they are afraid of water) 

1259
00:49:38,926 --> 00:49:40,059
You're lying. 

1260
00:49:40,426 --> 00:49:41,993
Thank you so much. 

1261
00:49:41,993 --> 00:49:43,226
(Jisoo gets a 1 on 1 lesson) 

1262
00:49:45,159 --> 00:49:47,759
(Swimming lessons are for free) 

1263
00:49:49,226 --> 00:49:52,293
(Jisoo tries to overcome her fear of water) 

1264
00:49:54,493 --> 00:49:56,259
That's not easy. 

1265
00:49:56,793 --> 00:50:00,326
But since I was there, I really wanted to make it work. 

1266
00:50:00,326 --> 00:50:01,559
But... 

1267
00:50:02,159 --> 00:50:04,193
It's surprising how stiff you are. 

1268
00:50:06,259 --> 00:50:09,226
(She practices over and over again) 

1269
00:50:11,393 --> 00:50:13,159
But through this trip... 

1270
00:50:13,159 --> 00:50:14,826
If you overcame your fear of water... 

1271
00:50:14,826 --> 00:50:16,959
- That's the best reward. / - She did it! 

1272
00:50:17,293 --> 00:50:18,393
(Jisoo is overcoming her fear of water little by little) 

1273
00:50:18,393 --> 00:50:19,726
She's doing it. 

1274
00:50:19,959 --> 00:50:21,826
She does look like a fish. 

1275
00:50:21,826 --> 00:50:22,893
Fish? 

1276
00:50:22,893 --> 00:50:25,259
Fish? Not a mermaid? 

1277
00:50:25,259 --> 00:50:27,493
I got it! 

1278
00:50:27,859 --> 00:50:29,659
I think it's working. 

1279
00:50:29,659 --> 00:50:31,126
I should give it a try again. 

1280
00:50:31,126 --> 00:50:33,093
But I know I should relax my body. 

1281
00:50:33,093 --> 00:50:35,559
I'm not very good at swimming and I'm afraid of water. 

1282
00:50:36,459 --> 00:50:37,859
I think I can do it 10 tries. 

1283
00:50:39,093 --> 00:50:40,026
Try? 

1284
00:50:41,626 --> 00:50:42,793
(She gives it a try with confidence) 

1285
00:50:43,726 --> 00:50:44,859
That's so... 

1286
00:50:44,859 --> 00:50:46,359
- Is that right? / - She's like... 

1287
00:50:46,959 --> 00:50:49,359
- It's more like shrimp than a mermaid. / - Shrimp? 

1288
00:50:49,359 --> 00:50:51,326
- Shrimp. / - It's shrimp. 

1289
00:50:54,759 --> 00:50:56,359
(Mijoo completed her swim) 

1290
00:50:57,526 --> 00:50:58,893
(Groaning) 

1291
00:50:59,126 --> 00:51:00,859
My ears... 

1292
00:51:02,093 --> 00:51:03,859
Mijoo, it looks like you're at a sauna. 

1293
00:51:03,859 --> 00:51:05,093
Wow, this is nice. 

1294
00:51:06,226 --> 00:51:07,259
This is refreshing. 

1295
00:51:07,759 --> 00:51:09,026
(This is how a mermaid has a sauna) 

1296
00:51:09,026 --> 00:51:10,426
My goodness. 

1297
00:51:11,193 --> 00:51:12,959
(What about Jisoo?) 

1298
00:51:15,659 --> 00:51:18,126
(She dives deep in the water without fear) 

1299
00:51:18,126 --> 00:51:19,926
- She looks pretty. / - She's doing it. 

1300
00:51:19,926 --> 00:51:21,493
- You're doing it. / - So pretty. 

1301
00:51:21,493 --> 00:51:23,659
Wow, this is amazing. 

1302
00:51:23,659 --> 00:51:26,826
(Jisoo has become a real mermaid) 

1303
00:51:31,459 --> 00:51:33,026
(A round of applause) 

1304
00:51:33,026 --> 00:51:34,659
This is touching. 

1305
00:51:35,759 --> 00:51:37,326
In 4 hours. 

1306
00:51:37,326 --> 00:51:39,893
- 4 hours? / - Yes, it took 4 hours. 

1307
00:51:39,893 --> 00:51:42,059
It's amazing that she managed to do it 

1308
00:51:42,059 --> 00:51:43,193
despite her fear of water. 

1309
00:51:43,193 --> 00:51:45,593
- This is fun. It's really fun. / - It is, right? 

1310
00:51:45,593 --> 00:51:47,226
It's so fun. It really is. 

1311
00:51:48,359 --> 00:51:49,759
You did well. 

1312
00:51:49,759 --> 00:51:51,093
- What? / - You did well. 

1313
00:51:51,793 --> 00:51:52,726
I win. 

1314
00:51:54,059 --> 00:51:56,626
I think I just overcame my fear of water. 

1315
00:51:56,859 --> 00:51:58,193
- Really? / - Yes. 

1316
00:51:58,193 --> 00:51:59,959
That's right. She overcame it. 

1317
00:51:59,959 --> 00:52:01,693
- That's what's important. / - Right. 

1318
00:52:01,693 --> 00:52:05,059
It doesn't matter whether she's a mermaid or shrimp. 

1319
00:52:05,059 --> 00:52:06,293
(The legend of the Kenting mermaids) 

1320
00:52:10,393 --> 00:52:12,026

1322

1323
00:52:19,193 --> 00:52:20,959
- She looks like a real mermaid. / - The shrimp. 

1324
00:52:20,959 --> 00:52:22,626
She's a shrimp. 

1325
00:52:23,426 --> 00:52:24,659
(Hello) 

1326
00:52:24,659 --> 00:52:26,893
She's relaxed now. 

1327
00:52:28,126 --> 00:52:29,659
- So good. / - That looks so pretty. 

1328
00:52:29,659 --> 00:52:31,059
Jisoo is very flexible. 

1329
00:52:31,059 --> 00:52:34,259
Jisoo looks much more flexible in the water. 

1330
00:52:40,326 --> 00:52:42,526
(Sometimes they look like seaweed fulvescens) 

1331

1333
00:52:49,093 --> 00:52:50,259
How was it? 

1334
00:52:50,259 --> 00:52:51,659
I had so much fun, 

1335
00:52:51,659 --> 00:52:55,493
so I didn't even think about my fear of water. 

1336
00:52:55,493 --> 00:52:58,159
- I mean it. It was a lot of fun. / - Right, it was so fun. 

1337
00:52:58,159 --> 00:52:59,326
- I'm hungry. / - Me too. 

1338
00:52:59,326 --> 00:53:00,559
- Are you ready to eat? / - Yes.

- I'm so hungry. / - Let's go. 

1341
00:53:03,993 --> 00:53:06,159
- How did you do that? / - The tail is heavy. 

1342
00:53:06,159 --> 00:53:06,926
She can't get out of the water. 

1343
00:53:06,926 --> 00:53:08,159
Grilled fish! 

1344
00:53:11,626 --> 00:53:12,993
Stop it. 

1345
00:53:15,293 --> 00:53:16,959
Whatever they eat, it will taste so good. 

1346
00:53:17,159 --> 00:53:18,259
- Right. / - We were really hungry. 

1347
00:53:18,259 --> 00:53:22,193
They swam for 4 hours. They must be very hungry. 

1348
00:53:23,193 --> 00:53:26,993
- We failed to ride a scooter yesterday. / - We did. 

1349
00:53:26,993 --> 00:53:28,393
So I called a taxi. 

1350

- I think that's it. / - Is that it? 

1351
00:53:30,826 --> 00:53:32,093
It's a taxi. 

1352
00:53:32,093 --> 00:53:34,126
- A taxi tour is famous in Taiwan. / - Right. 

1353
00:53:34,126 --> 00:53:36,093
- We will use this taxi today. / - Really? 

1354
00:53:36,093 --> 00:53:38,726
- So it's like we have a chauffeur. / - Our chauffeur. 

1355
00:53:38,726 --> 00:53:41,593
You don't pay for distance. 

1356
00:53:41,593 --> 00:53:44,959
- We rent it for a few hours. / - For the time you want. 

1357
00:53:44,959 --> 00:53:46,693
- So it's like your chauffeur. / - Right. 

1358
00:53:46,693 --> 00:53:48,293
The driver is with them the whole time. 

1359
00:53:48,759 --> 00:53:50,226
- Hello. / - Hello. 

1360
00:53:50,226 --> 00:53:51,659
The driver is a woman. 

1361

- Thank you. / - Thank you. 

1363
00:53:56,759 --> 00:53:58,026
Something smells good in here. 

1364

In Korea, they take the trash for you. 

1370
00:54:26,426 --> 00:54:27,926
But here, the people have to load it themselves. 

1371
00:54:27,926 --> 00:54:29,693
Look. They are coming out with the garbage. 

1372
00:54:29,893 --> 00:54:31,259
- They're in a hurry. / - Yeah. 

1373
00:54:31,259 --> 00:54:33,393
They are busy dumping the garbage. 

1374
00:54:33,393 --> 00:54:35,326
- Wow. / - They dump the garbage themselves? 

1375
00:54:35,326 --> 00:54:36,626
They do it themselves. 

1376
00:54:36,626 --> 00:54:38,726
Some people were running out as they were late. 

1377
00:54:38,993 --> 00:54:40,993
- Do you know where we are? / - Where? 

1378
00:54:40,993 --> 00:54:43,159
- This place is called Hengchun. / - Hengchun? 

1379
00:54:43,159 --> 00:54:44,759
Right, this is the old downtown. 

1380
00:54:44,759 --> 00:54:46,526
So this place feels old and young at the same time. 

1381
00:54:46,526 --> 00:54:50,193
There are stores like this. 

1382
00:54:50,193 --> 00:54:51,959
In Korea, this place is like... 

1383
00:54:51,959 --> 00:54:54,326
Seongsu-dong or Gyeongnidan-gil. 

1384
00:54:54,326 --> 00:54:56,593
You're right. It has that feeling. 

1385
00:54:56,593 --> 00:55:00,259
Hengchun is near Kenting. 

1386
00:55:00,259 --> 00:55:01,759
It's Hengchun. 

1387
00:55:01,759 --> 00:55:04,159
- This is the South Gate. / - It's Hengchun. 

1388
00:55:05,226 --> 00:55:06,693
It is Hamchun in Korean. 

1389
00:55:06,693 --> 00:55:09,359
(Lots of old restaurants and traditional stores) 

1390
00:55:10,259 --> 00:55:11,926
It means always youth. 

1391
00:55:11,926 --> 00:55:13,459
(There are also small shops that sell pretty items) 

1392
00:55:13,459 --> 00:55:15,293
There are a lot of pretty shops. 

1393
00:55:15,593 --> 00:55:16,726
It looks pretty. 

1394
00:55:16,726 --> 00:55:19,593
(Young artists settled here and the visitors grew) 

1395
00:55:20,259 --> 00:55:21,859
(Hengchun) 

1396
00:55:21,859 --> 00:55:23,926
(Traditional restaurants and trendy streets) 

1397
00:55:23,926 --> 00:55:25,693
- Everything is nearby. / - Yes. 

1398
00:55:25,693 --> 00:55:27,893
It only takes about 5 to 10 minutes on foot. 

1399
00:55:27,893 --> 00:55:28,993
I'm really hungry. 

1400
00:55:28,993 --> 00:55:31,193
I found a good restaurant. 

1401
00:55:31,193 --> 00:55:32,426
Let me tell you about it. 

1402
00:55:32,426 --> 00:55:34,259
This place is good for people like you,

who don't like spices. 

1404
00:55:35,893 --> 00:55:38,993
It's traditional but trendy. 

1405
00:55:39,359 --> 00:55:40,859
The place looks clean. 

1406
00:55:40,859 --> 00:55:42,926
I know. It's clean and the food is good too. 

1407
00:55:43,826 --> 00:55:44,826
- I think it looks good. / - You can look forward to it. 

1408
00:55:44,826 --> 00:55:46,493
I've never let you down yet. 

1409
00:55:46,493 --> 00:55:48,893
They said a lot of visitors go to this restaurant. 

1410
00:55:49,593 --> 00:55:50,859
Oh, it's beef noodle soup. 

1411
00:55:50,859 --> 00:55:52,026
Beef noodle soup. 

1412
00:55:53,093 --> 00:55:55,293
- This one looks good for beer. / - It was really good. 

1413
00:55:55,293 --> 00:55:56,859

This one looks delicious. 

1415
00:55:59,559 --> 00:56:02,226
It's beef noodle soup with different noodles. 

1416
00:56:03,293 --> 00:56:06,093
(How does the original beef noodle soup taste?) 

1417
00:56:07,593 --> 00:56:09,626
This place is just like the one we visited yesterday. 

1418
00:56:10,326 --> 00:56:12,626
- It's a self-serve restaurant. / - Really? 

1419
00:56:13,193 --> 00:56:16,093
Think about it. I served all the dishes yesterday. 

1420
00:56:16,093 --> 00:56:16,659
Chopsticks. 

1421
00:56:16,659 --> 00:56:18,626
You'll go and get it? Okay, thanks. 

1422
00:56:18,626 --> 00:56:21,159

1424
00:56:23,259 --> 00:56:24,693
I won't complain and get it for you. 

1425
00:56:24,693 --> 00:56:26,626
You're dead tomorrow. 

1426
00:56:28,126 --> 00:56:31,793
Jisoo. Jisoo. Jisoo. Jisoo. 

1427
00:56:31,793 --> 00:56:34,126
- Jisoo. / - Okay, fine. I'll go. 

1428
00:56:34,126 --> 00:56:35,259
Fine, I'll just do it. 

1429
00:56:35,259 --> 00:56:36,559
Geez. 

1430
00:56:36,559 --> 00:56:38,459
- I'll go bring water. / - You should do that. 

1431
00:56:38,459 --> 00:56:39,959
You bring the side dishes. 

1432
00:56:39,959 --> 00:56:41,026
What is this? 

1433
00:56:41,326 --> 00:56:42,159
What's that? 

1434
00:56:42,159 --> 00:56:43,493
They even have soft drinks. 

1435
00:56:43,493 --> 00:56:44,793
(The new paradigm of side dishes) 

1436
00:56:46,293 --> 00:56:48,526
This is Korean kimchi. 

1437
00:56:48,526 --> 00:56:50,126

- They have kimchi? / - Yes, they do. 

1440
00:56:53,459 --> 00:56:54,759
They make it themselves. 

1441
00:56:54,759 --> 00:56:56,426
- Do they? / - It's raining here too. 

1442
00:56:56,426 --> 00:56:57,559
It's raining. 

1443
00:56:59,293 --> 00:57:00,393
It's coming. 

1444
00:57:00,393 --> 00:57:01,493
(What is the first dish?) 

1445
00:57:02,893 --> 00:57:05,459
(A dish that's fun to pick out what you want) 

1446
00:57:07,426 --> 00:57:08,459
(Taiwanese assorted boiled meat, $7) 

1447
00:57:08,459 --> 00:57:10,226

00:57:12,293 --> 00:57:13,159
Yes. 

1450
00:57:13,159 --> 00:57:15,459
It's the stomach of a cow. 

1451
00:57:15,459 --> 00:57:16,526
It's the stomach. 

1452
00:57:18,226 --> 00:57:19,926
(She tastes it without hesitation) 

1453
00:57:20,093 --> 00:57:21,993
What is this? It looks like mushrooms. 

1454
00:57:22,193 --> 00:57:23,359
Wow, this is so good. 

1455
00:57:24,393 --> 00:57:25,626
It's delicious. 

1456
00:57:26,459 --> 00:57:27,526
It's good, isn't it? 

1457
00:57:27,526 --> 00:57:28,626
(Nice) 

1458
00:57:28,726 --> 00:57:31,326
- This is so good. / - This is like smoked pork hocks. 

1459
00:57:31,326 --> 00:57:32,459
It smells like that. 

1460
00:57:32,693 --> 00:57:35,826
It must be good. It's braised in soy sauce. 

1461
00:57:36,426 --> 00:57:37,759
I like this one better. 

1462
00:57:38,126 --> 00:57:39,193
This is... 

1463
00:57:41,859 --> 00:57:43,059
It's chili oil. 

1464
00:57:43,059 --> 00:57:44,193
It was good. 

1465
00:57:44,193 --> 00:57:45,959
Isn't this just meat? 

1466
00:57:45,959 --> 00:57:47,626
(Beef leg with chili oil) 

1467
00:57:51,793 --> 00:57:53,459
- Boiled meat. / - Boiled meat? 

1468
00:57:53,459 --> 00:57:54,426
Just tastes like boiled meat? 

1469
00:57:54,426 --> 00:57:55,693
Yeah. 

1470
00:57:55,693 --> 00:57:56,826
(Chomp) 

1471
00:57:59,193 --> 00:58:00,759
I don't like it much. 

1472
00:58:01,559 --> 00:58:04,426
It's beef so if you boil it too much, it gets dry. 

1473
00:58:04,426 --> 00:58:05,626
(It's a little dry and tough) 

1474
00:58:06,593 --> 00:58:08,493
- I like this one the best. / - Me too. 

1475
00:58:08,493 --> 00:58:09,959
The stomach was the best. 

1476
00:58:09,959 --> 00:58:11,359
It's really good. 

1477
00:58:11,359 --> 00:58:12,559
It's a good cut. 

1478
00:58:13,859 --> 00:58:16,193
- It's chewy. / - I'll eat it for dinner. 

1479
00:58:18,093 --> 00:58:19,859
- I guess this is it. / - Beef noodle soup. 

1480
00:58:19,859 --> 00:58:21,259
(They ordered two kinds of beef noodle soup) 

1481
00:58:21,559 --> 00:58:23,026
(A clear soup and a red soup) 

1482
00:58:23,026 --> 00:58:24,526
You can choose the soup 

1483
00:58:24,526 --> 00:58:26,093
and the type of noodles you want. 

1484
00:58:29,493 --> 00:58:30,593
(Adding spring onion oil broth) 

1485
00:58:30,593 --> 00:58:32,126
It was really good. 

1486
00:58:32,126 --> 00:58:35,726
Did you see the chili oil at the bottom of the bowl? 

1487
00:58:35,726 --> 00:58:36,993
It floats to the top. 

1488
00:58:37,226 --> 00:58:39,659
The hot soup makes it rise. 

1489
00:58:40,359 --> 00:58:41,726
(What does the soup taste like?) 

1490
00:58:44,259 --> 00:58:45,559
(They raise their heads at the same time) 

1491
00:58:45,559 --> 00:58:46,893
This is so good. 

1492
00:58:47,193 --> 00:58:48,893
The noodles are like udon. 

1493
00:58:49,293 --> 00:58:50,959
It tastes like udon. 

1494
00:58:50,959 --> 00:58:53,726
I think it tastes like hot pot 

1495
00:58:53,726 --> 00:58:55,093
without spices. 

1496
00:58:55,759 --> 00:58:57,559
I've never tried hot pot, so I don't know. 

1497
00:58:58,359 --> 00:59:00,726
- I think the oil would taste good. / - Yes. 

1498
00:59:00,726 --> 00:59:01,893
It was really good. 

1499
00:59:02,193 --> 00:59:03,293
The spring onion oil. 

1500
00:59:04,793 --> 00:59:07,259
The noodles are coated with spring onion oil. 

1501
00:59:07,259 --> 00:59:09,126
That's right. 

1502
00:59:09,726 --> 00:59:11,726
- This is really good. / - I love it. 

1503
00:59:12,793 --> 00:59:15,759
I want to visit this place again later. 

1504
00:59:16,159 --> 00:59:17,659
We picked a good one. 

1505
00:59:17,659 --> 00:59:18,959
Hey, it's me. 

1506
00:59:19,526 --> 00:59:21,059
- I picked it. / - Okay. 

1507
00:59:21,059 --> 00:59:22,293
I admit it. 

1508
00:59:22,526 --> 00:59:23,693
Try the meat. 

1509
00:59:24,326 --> 00:59:26,559
That's the highlight of beef noodle soup. 

1510
00:59:27,659 --> 00:59:29,826
- Wow, it looks so good. / - It was great. 

1511
00:59:29,826 --> 00:59:31,026
- It was filling, right? / - Yes, it is. 

1512
00:59:31,026 --> 00:59:32,393
- It was very plump. / - I can see that. 

1513
00:59:34,426 --> 00:59:35,593
It doesn't have a smell. 

1514
00:59:35,593 --> 00:59:37,059
(Yum) 

1515
00:59:38,193 --> 00:59:39,559
The meat tastes really clean. 

1516
00:59:39,559 --> 00:59:42,793
The texture is like tender braised beef. 

1517
00:59:42,793 --> 00:59:44,126
- Yes, it's like braised beef. / - Right? 

1518
00:59:44,126 --> 00:59:47,593
They boiled the beef but it has a very clean taste. 

1519
00:59:49,126 --> 00:59:50,226
- It's so tender. / - Right? 

1520
00:59:50,426 --> 00:59:52,226
- The soup must be good there. / - Yes. 

1521
00:59:52,226 --> 00:59:54,093
The soup was so rich, so it was delicious. 

1522
00:59:54,093 --> 00:59:55,493
(Taiwanese style glass noodles in red beef soup) 

1523
00:59:57,559 --> 00:59:59,159
You can also choose the meat. 

1524
00:59:59,159 --> 01:00:01,759
- The glass noodles look good. / - Meat, glass noodles. 

1525
01:00:01,759 --> 01:00:03,326

1526
01:00:03,326 --> 01:00:06,659
- Koreans all like glass noodles. / - Everyone likes it. 

1527
01:00:07,193 --> 01:00:09,059
(They take a sip of the soup first) 

1528
01:00:11,259 --> 01:00:12,293
It's good. 

1529
01:00:13,926 --> 01:00:15,893
It's really similar to those diet noodles. 

1530
01:00:19,259 --> 01:00:21,126
- She's eating it together. / - It's like konjac noodles? 

1531
01:00:21,126 --> 01:00:22,193
Yes. 

1532
01:00:23,393 --> 01:00:24,426
It's really chewy. 

1533
01:00:24,426 --> 01:00:26,426
Konjac noodles taste like you won't gain weight. 

1534
01:00:26,426 --> 01:00:28,859
Those noodles taste like you'll gain weight. 

1535
01:00:28,859 --> 01:00:30,526
It's chewy and delicious. 

1536
01:00:30,526 --> 01:00:32,093
It was delicious. The glass noodles... 

1537
01:00:32,093 --> 01:00:34,193
If it's chewy and tasty, it will make you gain weight. 

1538
01:00:34,193 --> 01:00:35,559
- It has a lot of starch. / - Yes. 

1539
01:00:35,559 --> 01:00:37,793
But it's zero calories if you enjoy eating it. 

1540
01:00:37,793 --> 01:00:39,459
- That's a lie. / - Who said that? 

1541
01:00:39,459 --> 01:00:42,126
A friend of mine said that while 

1542
01:00:42,126 --> 01:00:43,526
mixing rice with sausage stew. 

1543
01:00:43,526 --> 01:00:44,926
- If it's good? / - If you enjoy eating it... 

1544
01:00:44,926 --> 01:00:46,293
- It's zero calories. / - As he was eating sausage stew? 

1545
01:00:46,293 --> 01:00:47,259
Let's also try this. 

1546
01:00:47,259 --> 01:00:49,659
I like these noodles because they're so chewy. 

1547
01:00:49,659 --> 01:00:51,426
- It's not that thick. / - Yes. 

1548
01:00:51,926 --> 01:00:54,259
It doesn't taste dry and it tastes clean. 

1549
01:00:55,359 --> 01:00:57,826
I think Koreans will like it... 

1550
01:00:58,393 --> 01:01:00,026
If you sell this in Korea. 

1551
01:01:00,026 --> 01:01:01,659
- Yes, I agree. / - It suits our palate. 

1552
01:01:01,659 --> 01:01:04,259
If you go to the market in Busan... 

1553
01:01:04,259 --> 01:01:06,526
- They sell glass noodle soup. / - Right. 

1554
01:01:07,126 --> 01:01:08,426
I'm curious. 

1555
01:01:08,426 --> 01:01:12,126
- The noodles that I, the elder, chose. / - Elder... 

1556
01:01:12,126 --> 01:01:14,059
She loves being called that. 

1557
01:01:14,293 --> 01:01:17,493
It could've been difficult to eat. 

1558
01:01:17,493 --> 01:01:19,459
But I didn't feel that way at all. It was fine. 

1559
01:01:19,459 --> 01:01:21,093
The price is also really cheap. 

1560
01:01:21,293 --> 01:01:23,759
I think you can eat it easily, so I really liked it. 

1561
01:01:23,959 --> 01:01:25,859
I really want to eat that with glass noodles. 

1562
01:01:25,859 --> 01:01:27,159
- Me too. / - It was really delicious. 

1563
01:01:27,159 --> 01:01:28,593
- With the red soup. / - Me too. 

1564
01:01:29,093 --> 01:01:30,593
- My score is... / - Yes? 

1565
01:01:31,126 --> 01:01:32,193
It's going off. 

1566
01:01:32,193 --> 01:01:33,259
(Hahaha) 

1567
01:01:34,093 --> 01:01:36,959
It's going off. 

1568
01:01:37,026 --> 01:01:38,159
What do we do about her? 

1569
01:01:38,626 --> 01:01:40,126
- It makes me tear up. / - It was that good. 

1570
01:01:41,393 --> 01:01:43,659
Was it enough to make you stand? 

1571
01:01:43,659 --> 01:01:45,759
Everything was perfect. 

1572
01:01:46,126 --> 01:01:48,593
The aroma, texture... 

1573
01:01:48,593 --> 01:01:52,459
It suited my tastes... I liked everything about it. 

1574
01:01:52,459 --> 01:01:53,826
- She liked everything. / - I prepared this. 

1575
01:01:53,826 --> 01:01:55,493
She liked everything. 

1576
01:01:55,793 --> 01:01:58,059
- She liked everything. / - It was better after a swim. 

1577
01:01:58,059 --> 01:01:59,826
- That's right. / - Everything tastes better that way. 

1578
01:01:59,826 --> 01:02:01,159
- We were so hungry. / - That's right. 

1579
01:02:01,159 --> 01:02:02,359
It will taste good. 

1580
01:02:02,359 --> 01:02:04,726
(They move to the outskirts of Hengchun) 

1581
01:02:08,426 --> 01:02:09,893
- This place is... / - It says Hengchun. 

1582
01:02:09,893 --> 01:02:11,359
- This place is... / - Yes. 

1583
01:02:11,359 --> 01:02:14,459
Hengchun 3000 Brewseum. 

1584
01:02:14,859 --> 01:02:16,259
- It's a museum? / - Yes, it's a museum. 

1585
01:02:16,259 --> 01:02:17,893
It's my first time at a museum. 

1586
01:02:18,093 --> 01:02:21,593
I was looking for a place that would feel new 

1587
01:02:21,593 --> 01:02:23,226
and memorable with you. 

1588
01:02:23,226 --> 01:02:25,426
- Can you try the beer? / - Yes, you can also try it. 

1589
01:02:25,426 --> 01:02:26,893
- Of course. / - So we'll go... 

1590
01:02:27,493 --> 01:02:29,693
- That's amazing. / - Let's go in. 

1591
01:02:29,859 --> 01:02:32,459
She's salivating even before she goes in. 

1592
01:02:32,459 --> 01:02:35,426
(Named after the 3,000 beer glass collection) 

1593
01:02:35,426 --> 01:02:36,693
Beer museum. 

1594
01:02:36,693 --> 01:02:38,326
- Yes. / - I've never seen this before. 

1595
01:02:38,326 --> 01:02:41,459
("Mona Lisa" made by beer labels) 

1596
01:02:41,459 --> 01:02:42,526
(You can understand the history and culture of beer) 

1597
01:02:42,526 --> 01:02:44,726
How long would he have had to collect for that? 

1598
01:02:44,726 --> 01:02:48,093
- Right? / - The owner really likes beer. 

1599
01:02:48,093 --> 01:02:51,926
(It's the only place you can taste Kenting beer) 

1600
01:02:53,026 --> 01:02:54,993
(Admission, $3.50 with 1 free can of beer) 

1601
01:02:54,993 --> 01:02:57,126
- It's $3.50 admission? / - Beers are fattening. 

1602
01:02:57,126 --> 01:02:58,426
They're tasty but... 

1603
01:02:58,426 --> 01:03:00,526
- In the old days... / - Wow. 

1604
01:03:00,526 --> 01:03:02,559
Isn't this beer? 

1605
01:03:02,559 --> 01:03:04,326
I think it's a beer mug or bottle. 

1606
01:03:04,726 --> 01:03:06,659
- This is really interesting. / - Yes. 

1607
01:03:06,659 --> 01:03:08,193
This is the oldest canned beer. 

1608
01:03:08,626 --> 01:03:10,259
- Really? / - It was made in 1935. 

1609
01:03:11,126 --> 01:03:14,126
- That's so amazing. / - They have old beers too. 

1610
01:03:14,126 --> 01:03:15,659
The oldest beer in Belgium. 

1611
01:03:15,659 --> 01:03:17,159
How did they drink this? 

1612
01:03:17,159 --> 01:03:19,826
- I think they bore a hole to drink. / - I see. 

1613
01:03:20,226 --> 01:03:23,426
That's the old can opener back in the day. 

1614
01:03:23,426 --> 01:03:25,093
- The triangular ones. / - Yes, triangular. 

1615
01:03:25,093 --> 01:03:26,326
You're right. 

1616
01:03:26,326 --> 01:03:27,293
That's right. 

1617
01:03:27,459 --> 01:03:30,426
Oh, this... This is this. 

1618
01:03:30,426 --> 01:03:31,893
This must be during prohibition. 

1619
01:03:31,893 --> 01:03:33,426
That's why everyone is protesting. 

1620
01:03:33,426 --> 01:03:35,959
- That must've been during prohibition. / - I see. 

1621
01:03:36,993 --> 01:03:38,926
We want beer. 

1622
01:03:38,926 --> 01:03:40,159
We do want beer. 

1623
01:03:41,026 --> 01:03:42,393
Where is it? 

1624
01:03:42,393 --> 01:03:44,959
- Where is it? / - What is this? Do they sell this? 

1625
01:03:44,959 --> 01:03:47,093
It's written "Kenting" here. 

1626
01:03:47,593 --> 01:03:50,726
They named it after the region. 

1627
01:03:51,426 --> 01:03:52,859
- It was named after Kenting. / - Cute. 

1628
01:03:52,859 --> 01:03:54,293
- It's a local beer. / - Yes. 

1629
01:03:54,293 --> 01:03:56,759
You get a can of that with the admission. 

1630
01:03:57,826 --> 01:04:00,759
- You have to try it there. / - Yes, you have to try it. 

1631
01:04:01,193 --> 01:04:03,093
- It will be good as a souvenir. / - Yeah. 

1632
01:04:03,093 --> 01:04:05,659
- And display it after you drink it. / - I want to do that. 

1633
01:04:05,826 --> 01:04:07,026
Oh, my. What is this? 

1634
01:04:07,426 --> 01:04:08,426
What is this? 

1635
01:04:08,426 --> 01:04:10,126
Thank you. Oops, what am I saying? 

1636
01:04:10,126 --> 01:04:11,859
Sir, what is this? 

1637
01:04:12,359 --> 01:04:14,259
- It's a can sealer. / - Okay. 

1638
01:04:16,026 --> 01:04:17,859
- It seals the cans. / - Yes. 

1639
01:04:18,626 --> 01:04:22,293
They put draft beer in the can. 

1640
01:04:23,059 --> 01:04:25,326
You can only drink draft beer here. 

1641
01:04:25,326 --> 01:04:26,493
Oh, my. 

1642
01:04:26,493 --> 01:04:30,826
- They seal the can like that. / - That's right. 

1643
01:04:33,093 --> 01:04:35,626
(Turn it with all your might) 

1644
01:04:35,626 --> 01:04:37,826
This is how you operate it. 

1645
01:04:40,493 --> 01:04:41,793
This is so amazing. 

1646
01:04:42,659 --> 01:04:44,259
(Canned beer is complete) 

1647
01:04:44,259 --> 01:04:45,426
This is so amazing. 

1648
01:04:45,426 --> 01:04:46,926
- How is it possible like this? / - It's like... 

1649
01:04:46,926 --> 01:04:49,226
It doesn't leak at all. 

1650
01:04:50,093 --> 01:04:51,626
It's so amazing. Wow. 

1651
01:04:51,693 --> 01:04:53,459
(Even if you shake it hard) 

1652
01:04:53,459 --> 01:04:54,926
It doesn't pop. 

1653
01:04:54,926 --> 01:04:57,093
- This is so amazing. / - What if it suddenly bursts? 

1654
01:04:57,093 --> 01:04:59,993
- You're right. / - Let's try this later... 

1655
01:04:59,993 --> 01:05:01,459
- And ask for a sampler. / - Sampler? 

1656
01:05:01,459 --> 01:05:03,293
- Do you want a sampler? / - Yes, a sampler. 

1657
01:05:03,293 --> 01:05:05,393
- Please. / - Okay, sure. 

1658
01:05:05,393 --> 01:05:06,393
- Sure. / - Wow. 

1659
01:05:07,393 --> 01:05:08,993
(Sampler set, $10.50) 

1660
01:05:08,993 --> 01:05:11,059
- They must brew that beer there. / - Yes. 

1661
01:05:11,459 --> 01:05:12,959
You can taste it there. 

1662
01:05:12,959 --> 01:05:15,026
Can you take it home after they make it there? 

1663
01:05:15,026 --> 01:05:17,993
- Yes, you can. / - They gave one draft beer each. 

1664
01:05:18,559 --> 01:05:20,493
They only sell draft beer there. 

1665
01:05:20,493 --> 01:05:22,226
(Saison, Chuhou, Kenting) 

1666
01:05:22,859 --> 01:05:25,893
You shouldn't drink this up in one go. 

1667
01:05:25,893 --> 01:05:28,026
- That's right. / - You have to drink elegantly. 

1668
01:05:29,393 --> 01:05:30,559
Drink it like wine. 

1669
01:05:30,559 --> 01:05:31,593
(Feels awkward doing this elegantly) 

1670
01:05:33,226 --> 01:05:35,159
How is it? 

1671
01:05:35,159 --> 01:05:37,193
- It's really good. / - Is it really good? 

1672
01:05:37,193 --> 01:05:39,293
It's not that bubbly. 

1673
01:05:39,293 --> 01:05:41,759
Isn't this really good? 

1674
01:05:43,326 --> 01:05:44,726
The beer looks so good. 

1675
01:05:45,493 --> 01:05:48,626
- It's sweet for a beer. / - Yes. 

1676
01:05:48,859 --> 01:05:51,159
It feels like it will be hard to get drunk from this. 

1677
01:05:51,159 --> 01:05:53,326
You know how to drink. 

1678
01:05:53,893 --> 01:05:55,659
You say, "I could drink this." 

1679
01:05:55,659 --> 01:05:57,459
And this is the type that gets your blind drunk. 

1680
01:05:57,459 --> 01:05:59,459
- Especially for people like you. / - Is that so? 

1681
01:06:00,526 --> 01:06:03,293
This has overwhelming visuals. 

1682
01:06:03,293 --> 01:06:05,293
You might like that the best. 

1683
01:06:05,293 --> 01:06:07,493
- It kind of smells like coffee. / - Yes. 

1684
01:06:09,326 --> 01:06:11,226
I think it feels like oriental medicine. 

1685
01:06:11,226 --> 01:06:13,093
Really? I made a name for this. 

1686
01:06:13,093 --> 01:06:14,226
Coffee vodka. 

1687
01:06:14,893 --> 01:06:17,693
It tastes like coffee on its way to oriental medicine. 

1688
01:06:18,526 --> 01:06:20,226
(The person who likes to drink feels bad for her) 

1689
01:06:20,226 --> 01:06:22,493
This will be strong for... 

1690
01:06:22,493 --> 01:06:24,393
- People who don't like to drink. / - True. 

1691
01:06:26,359 --> 01:06:29,259
- They give two more free drinks. / - Yes. 

1692
01:06:30,326 --> 01:06:32,993
I prepared a place with... 

1693
01:06:32,993 --> 01:06:35,259
- An atmosphere that we will like. / - Really? 

1694
01:06:35,759 --> 01:06:37,893
Mijoo. 

1695
01:06:38,659 --> 01:06:40,426
- I think we should get wet. / - Okay. 

1696
01:06:40,759 --> 01:06:42,493
- Get wet? / - Let's get wet. 

1697
01:06:43,226 --> 01:06:44,793
- Okay. / - Let's go. 

1698
01:06:45,193 --> 01:06:46,459
(Going Off Tour, Mijoo's Day) 

1699
01:06:46,459 --> 01:06:48,259
(Beach bar) 

1700
01:06:48,259 --> 01:06:50,159
- A beach bar? / - Yes. 

1701
01:06:51,759 --> 01:06:57,259
(It takes 10 minutes by car to South Bay) 

1702
01:06:58,393 --> 01:07:01,959
(South Bay) 

1703
01:07:01,959 --> 01:07:04,159
It looks like Jeju-do, Hawaii, 

1704
01:07:04,159 --> 01:07:05,659
and Saipan. 

1705
01:07:05,659 --> 01:07:07,959
(It's secluded and relaxing) 

1706
01:07:08,793 --> 01:07:11,026
(They came to the blue sea) 

1707
01:07:11,526 --> 01:07:13,959
- It's so beautiful. / - It really is. 

1708
01:07:14,393 --> 01:07:17,326
- It's so beautiful. / - I'm not lying but... 

1709
01:07:17,326 --> 01:07:20,226
- It's the best ocean I've ever seen. / - Me too. 

1710
01:07:20,226 --> 01:07:21,893
Isn't the color of the cloud pretty? 

1711
01:07:21,893 --> 01:07:25,093
- It looks pink and orange. / - It's so pretty. 

1712
01:07:25,093 --> 01:07:27,326
(Pink clouds and a sky blue sea) 

1713
01:07:27,326 --> 01:07:29,893
I can feel the inner healing... 

1714
01:07:29,893 --> 01:07:31,326
- By just looking at it. / - You're right. 

1715
01:07:31,726 --> 01:07:33,893
Looking at this... 

1716
01:07:33,893 --> 01:07:36,126
Makes me feel like I'm also there. 

1717
01:07:36,126 --> 01:07:40,226
- Yes. / - That's why people watch this program. 

1718
01:07:41,193 --> 01:07:43,226
You can watch it as you're filled with 

1719
01:07:43,226 --> 01:07:43,993
dreams and excitement. 

1720
01:07:43,993 --> 01:07:46,026
It feels like we're there with Lovelyz. 

1721
01:07:46,026 --> 01:07:47,226
You're right. 

1722
01:07:48,126 --> 01:07:50,893
(The sun of Mijoo's day is setting) 

1723
01:07:52,059 --> 01:07:53,726
(It's finally the last itinerary) 

1724
01:07:53,726 --> 01:07:55,026
I don't know why, but that place is nice. 

1725
01:07:55,826 --> 01:07:58,759
I wanted to come here because 

1726
01:07:58,759 --> 01:08:01,626
I wanted to go somewhere with a good atmosphere 

1727
01:08:01,626 --> 01:08:03,026
and have a cocktail with you. 

1728
01:08:03,026 --> 01:08:05,893
That's why I brought you here. 

1729
01:08:06,426 --> 01:08:07,693
You're so considerate. 

1730
01:08:08,193 --> 01:08:09,293
Look at the stars. 

1731
01:08:10,393 --> 01:08:12,059
There are so many. 

1732
01:08:13,059 --> 01:08:16,393
You can't see this in Seoul at all. 

1733
01:08:16,393 --> 01:08:17,693
It's so pretty. 

1734
01:08:17,693 --> 01:08:20,359
It would be nice if you just lie down... 

1735
01:08:20,359 --> 01:08:22,626
- And watch the stars. / - Yeah. 

1736
01:08:22,926 --> 01:08:24,059
It must have been nice. 

1737
01:08:24,559 --> 01:08:25,693
Cheers. 

1738
01:08:26,026 --> 01:08:27,193
Okay. 

1739
01:08:27,193 --> 01:08:28,993
(As they drink the cocktails) 

1740
01:08:30,659 --> 01:08:32,026
(Mijoo and Jisoo end their trip) 

1741
01:08:32,026 --> 01:08:35,659
It makes me feel so happy 

1742
01:08:35,659 --> 01:08:37,026
after drinking this cocktail. 

1743
01:08:37,326 --> 01:08:39,159
Did you choose your top 3 favorite things? 

1744
01:08:39,159 --> 01:08:41,159
- It's the long-awaited list. / - Did you choose? 

1745
01:08:41,159 --> 01:08:44,459
- Did you choose the top 3? / - I'm still in dilemma. 

1746
01:08:45,226 --> 01:08:46,426
(Should we start from 3rd place?) 

1747
01:08:46,426 --> 01:08:47,426
3rd place? 

1748
01:08:47,593 --> 01:08:51,059
This is so difficult. Can't we have a joint winner? 

1749
01:08:53,026 --> 01:08:56,359
Let's choose the 3rd place. 1, 2, 3. 

1750
01:08:56,359 --> 01:08:57,459
- The park. / - The night market. 

1751
01:08:58,459 --> 01:09:00,359
(They're different) 

1752
01:09:00,359 --> 01:09:02,626
- They just don't match. / - They don't. 

1753
01:09:02,626 --> 01:09:04,526
I really felt that we're really different right now. 

1754
01:09:05,393 --> 01:09:06,659
- You ready for the 2nd place? / - Yes, I am. 

1755
01:09:07,293 --> 01:09:09,859
- 2nd place. / - 1, 2, 3. 

1756
01:09:09,859 --> 01:09:10,959
- The night market. / - The mermaid experience. 

1757
01:09:12,126 --> 01:09:13,693
How can you match that? 

1758
01:09:14,793 --> 01:09:16,393
We're really different. 

1759
01:09:16,393 --> 01:09:17,459
(It's fortunate they didn't fight on this trip) 

1760
01:09:17,659 --> 01:09:18,926
Until the very end. 

1761
01:09:19,059 --> 01:09:21,126
I'm curious about 1st place. I hope we get this right. 

1762
01:09:21,126 --> 01:09:23,926
- I think they will get the 1st place right. / - Yeah. 

1763
01:09:24,093 --> 01:09:25,259
I've decided. 

1764
01:09:25,926 --> 01:09:30,326
- 1, 2, 3. / - 1, 2, 3. 

1765
01:09:30,326 --> 01:09:32,093
- This place. / - Scooters. 

1766
01:09:32,393 --> 01:09:34,993
(How can they be so different?) 

1767
01:09:36,259 --> 01:09:38,059
- They're different until the end. / - So different. 

1768
01:09:38,559 --> 01:09:40,026
They are not compatible. 

1769
01:09:41,459 --> 01:09:43,193
I chose this place because 

1770
01:09:43,193 --> 01:09:45,159
out of all the places I've been... 

1771
01:09:45,159 --> 01:09:47,159
It provided the most inner healing. 

1772
01:09:47,793 --> 01:09:49,126
I think that's right. 

1773
01:09:49,126 --> 01:09:52,026
The wind that hits you as you ride... 

1774
01:09:52,026 --> 01:09:53,993
It relieved all of my stress. 

1775
01:09:53,993 --> 01:09:55,493
We also screamed. 

1776
01:09:55,493 --> 01:09:59,959
Yes, I think that people should really try that. 

1777
01:09:59,959 --> 01:10:02,093
I think Jisoo will learn how to ride a bike 

1778
01:10:02,093 --> 01:10:03,326
and return to drive that scooter. 

1779
01:10:03,326 --> 01:10:04,793
Yes, I really want to. 

1780
01:10:05,093 --> 01:10:06,593
I think it will be nice... 

1781
01:10:06,593 --> 01:10:08,759
If we get our license and learn how to ride a bike. 

1782
01:10:08,759 --> 01:10:10,926
Yeah, it'd be nice to return here and do it again. 

1783
01:10:10,926 --> 01:10:14,093
That's why I thought it was a very fun experience. 

1784
01:10:14,093 --> 01:10:15,159
- Everything was fun. / - That's right. 

1785
01:10:15,159 --> 01:10:16,359
Everything was also fun for me. 

1786
01:10:16,359 --> 01:10:19,726
- It was hard to choose. / - It really was. 

1787
01:10:20,126 --> 01:10:21,426
Everything is a good memory 

1788
01:10:21,426 --> 01:10:24,493
and an interesting experience. I loved it. 

1789
01:10:25,459 --> 01:10:28,726
- I couldn't leave anything out. / - Yeah. 

1790
01:10:29,059 --> 01:10:32,126
We beginners ended this trip well. 

1791
01:10:32,126 --> 01:10:34,926
- That's right. / - I thought it'd be so hard. 

1792
01:10:34,926 --> 01:10:37,259
- But it was a success, so I'm happy. / - It was so good. 

1793
01:10:37,459 --> 01:10:39,759
We learned how to travel. 

1794
01:10:39,759 --> 01:10:41,826
And how to have fun. 

1795
01:10:42,793 --> 01:10:44,593
- Let's travel a lot from now on. / - Yes. 

1796
01:10:44,893 --> 01:10:46,059
- We're really different but... / - Let's travel a lot. 

1797
01:10:46,059 --> 01:10:47,759
- Okay. / - Let's try. 

1798
01:10:47,759 --> 01:10:49,226
- Cheers. / - Let's go off and party. 

1799
01:10:49,226 --> 01:10:51,226
- Cheers to Going Off Tour. / - Let's go. 

1800
01:10:51,226 --> 01:10:53,759
(The end of Going Off Tour in Kenting) 

1801
01:10:55,759 --> 01:10:57,659
(Kenting is a place that people really want to go) 

1802
01:10:57,659 --> 01:10:59,693
You had so much fun. 

1803
01:10:59,693 --> 01:11:01,459
They really went off. 

1804
01:11:01,459 --> 01:11:04,459
Were the scooters that much fun? 

1805
01:11:04,459 --> 01:11:06,259
- I really liked it. / - Yes. 

1806
01:11:06,259 --> 01:11:08,526
As we rode down that road... 

1807
01:11:08,526 --> 01:11:11,659
It felt different to the coastal roads in Jeju-do. 

1808
01:11:11,659 --> 01:11:14,793
It felt refreshing while going up on a hill. 

1809
01:11:14,793 --> 01:11:17,226
I couldn't believe what I was seeing. 

1810
01:11:17,426 --> 01:11:19,793
I thought I was looking at a picture. 

1811
01:11:19,793 --> 01:11:22,359
Can you rent scooters without a license? 

1812
01:11:22,359 --> 01:11:24,259
- You can. / - You don't need a driver's license. 

1813
01:11:24,259 --> 01:11:28,826
It's electric and the maximum speed is set to 40kmph. 

1814
01:11:28,826 --> 01:11:30,393
- That's probably why. / - So it's safe. 

1815
01:11:30,393 --> 01:11:32,793
I don't think there were a lot of rented cars. 

1816
01:11:32,793 --> 01:11:37,059
Taiwan doesn't issue international driver's licenses. 

1817
01:11:37,059 --> 01:11:38,493
So you can't rent cars. 

1818
01:11:38,493 --> 01:11:40,926
That's why you rent a taxi for a day. 

1819
01:11:40,926 --> 01:11:44,193
- That's a good idea. / - It was under $100, right? 

1820
01:11:44,193 --> 01:11:45,059
Yes. 

1821
01:11:45,059 --> 01:11:46,226
Yes, that's not bad. 

1822
01:11:46,226 --> 01:11:48,293
You overcame your fear with the mermaid experience. 

1823
01:11:48,293 --> 01:11:52,259
That was great. I want to her applaud her again. 

1824
01:11:52,259 --> 01:11:55,693
- It looked really unique and fun. / - Yes. 

1825
01:11:55,926 --> 01:11:57,026
How was it really? 

1826
01:11:57,026 --> 01:12:00,193
I was so scared at first, but I enjoyed it in the end. 

1827
01:12:00,193 --> 01:12:01,459
I think my fear of water is gone. 

1828
01:12:01,459 --> 01:12:04,059
How about going with a mermaid concept 

1829
01:12:04,059 --> 01:12:04,726
for your next album? 

1830
01:12:04,726 --> 01:12:06,026
Comeback as mermaids. 

1831
01:12:07,793 --> 01:12:09,193
It was so nice, 

1832
01:12:09,193 --> 01:12:10,759
so I want to introduce it to my members. 

1833
01:12:10,759 --> 01:12:12,359
- Was it that good? / - Yes. 

1834
01:12:12,359 --> 01:12:16,326
There are packages where you can go out to sea. 

1835
01:12:16,326 --> 01:12:17,293
Yes, I saw that. 

1836
01:12:17,293 --> 01:12:18,393
- That'd look even prettier. / - Yes. 

1837
01:12:18,393 --> 01:12:20,659
- That's why it was expensive. / - Yes. 

1838
01:12:21,359 --> 01:12:23,026
We have to look at how much you spent. 

1839
01:12:23,026 --> 01:12:25,059
- The mermaid experience was expensive. / - It was. 

1840
01:12:25,059 --> 01:12:26,626
They were there longer as well. 

1841
01:12:26,626 --> 01:12:28,793
Fortunately, they only used one room. 

1842
01:12:28,793 --> 01:12:30,959
- They used one room. / - They did. 

1843
01:12:30,959 --> 01:12:32,893
And the food was really cheap. 

1844
01:12:32,893 --> 01:12:37,193
- We went to Taiwan a lot before. / - Yes. 

1845
01:12:37,193 --> 01:12:38,526
- We did. / - Let's see the prices. 

1846
01:12:38,526 --> 01:12:41,359
First, let's see how much Shin Dong... 

1847
01:12:41,359 --> 01:12:43,059
- And Kim Shinyeong spent. / - Is that Shinyeong? 

1848
01:12:43,059 --> 01:12:44,059
Yes. 

1849
01:12:45,326 --> 01:12:47,626
- They went to Taipei. / - How much did they spend? 

1850
01:12:47,626 --> 01:12:49,259
Let's see how much they spent. 

1851
01:12:49,793 --> 01:12:51,126
- They must have spent quite a lot. / - Yes. 

1852
01:12:51,126 --> 01:12:52,593
That's a lot. 

1853
01:12:53,193 --> 01:12:55,293
- It's $346.80. / - Yes. 

1854
01:12:55,293 --> 01:13:01,126
Apink's Chorong and Hayoung went to Kaohsiung. 

1855
01:13:01,526 --> 01:13:03,326
- They also used $340. / - I guess that's the average. 

1856
01:13:03,326 --> 01:13:05,393
- It's around $350. / - That's right. 

1857
01:13:05,393 --> 01:13:09,326
Okay. Let's see how much Going Off Tour spent. 

1858
01:13:09,759 --> 01:13:12,893
The amount that Going Off Tour spent over 

1859
01:13:12,893 --> 01:13:15,259
3 days and 2 nights in Kenting is... 

1860
01:13:15,259 --> 01:13:16,393
Is? 

1861
01:13:16,659 --> 01:13:18,759
- Excluding airfares. / - Excluding airfares. 

1862
01:13:18,759 --> 01:13:20,326
- Per person. / - Per person. 

1863
01:13:20,826 --> 01:13:22,226
- We spent... / - Total? 

1864
01:13:22,493 --> 01:13:26,259
- $360.20. / - $300? 

1865
01:13:26,259 --> 01:13:27,459
($360.20 per person) 

1866
01:13:29,659 --> 01:13:31,993
- Wait... / - It was similar. 

1867
01:13:31,993 --> 01:13:34,726
We invested in our lodging. 

1868
01:13:34,726 --> 01:13:37,559
- They invested in activities. / - Being mermaids. 

1869
01:13:37,559 --> 01:13:38,859
- The activities. / - The taxi rental. 

1870
01:13:38,859 --> 01:13:41,659
- Right, they rented the taxi. / - Right. 

1871
01:13:41,659 --> 01:13:44,393
Please stand up and tell us your final thoughts. 

1872
01:13:44,393 --> 01:13:48,093
