00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,607
They say a dragon came down from heaven. 

2
00:00:01,607 --> 00:00:03,107
That's why it's called that. 

3
00:00:04,707 --> 00:00:06,573
We'll check out all of Ha Long Bay. 

4
00:00:06,573 --> 00:00:08,040
It's so beautiful! 

5
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:10,240
Hey, this is really cool. What a view. 

6
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:13,573
It's really mysterious. 

7
00:00:15,073 --> 00:00:16,507
It feels like "Lord of the Rings." 

8
00:00:16,507 --> 00:00:19,073
You'll try something you've never had before. 

9
00:00:19,073 --> 00:00:20,340
This is really good. 

10
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:24,240
I can't stop. 

11
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:26,307
I'm about to cry. 

12

Travel is war. 

17
00:00:40,873 --> 00:00:43,973
Battle Trip! 

18
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:46,640
Just like last week, it's a family trip. 

19
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:48,807
We have our trip planners who went on family trips. 

20
00:00:48,807 --> 00:00:51,373
- Welcome back. / - Nice to meet you. 

21
00:00:51,373 --> 00:00:54,040
We have our 100 impartial judges 

22
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:56,407
who will vote on today's trips. 

23
00:00:56,407 --> 00:00:58,973
(100 judges in the audience) 

24
00:00:58,973 --> 00:01:01,673
We watched Ha Long Bay, Vietnam last week. 

25
00:01:01,673 --> 00:01:03,540
I admit it was good. 

26
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:06,007
- I wanted to try goat meat. / - Right. 

27
00:01:06,007 --> 00:01:08,173
- And I wanted to try the seaplane. / - Me too. 

28
00:01:08,173 --> 00:01:10,040
I have to admit that it was great. 

29
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:11,140
You liked it too, right, NC.A? 

30
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:14,607
Yes. I was impressed by goat meat. 

31
00:01:14,607 --> 00:01:19,207
Actually, my mom hates goat meat. 

32
00:01:19,207 --> 00:01:21,740
So I think Hong Kong will be 

33
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:23,740
a better choice for my family trip. 

34
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:25,840
But you haven't tried goat meat before. 

35
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:27,573
It doesn't taste like goat meat. 

36
00:01:27,573 --> 00:01:29,973
- But it's goat meat. / - It's not what you think. 

37
00:01:29,973 --> 00:01:33,240
Think about rice noodles and bun cha with the trip. 

38
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:34,540
- You're right. / - It's just amazing. 

39
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:36,140
Where would you go for your family trip? 

40
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:37,440
- Hong Kong. / - Hong Kong? 

41
00:01:38,173 --> 00:01:39,640
- Hong Kong. / - Ina. 

42
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:41,107
You don't have to go anywhere else. 

43
00:01:41,107 --> 00:01:43,207
Hong Kong has the three key elements of traveling. 

44
00:01:43,207 --> 00:01:44,640
- You can take good photos... / - Good photos. 

45
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:47,907
Have good food and go shopping. 

46
00:01:47,907 --> 00:01:49,873
I think it's perfect for a family trip. 

47
00:01:49,873 --> 00:01:51,107
Are you talking about photos that everyone 

48
00:01:51,107 --> 00:01:52,440
already has? 

49
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:53,840
- What kind of photo is that? / - That's not the same. 

50
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,673
- They're different. / - It varies from person to person. 

51
00:01:55,673 --> 00:01:57,407
You know what? 

52
00:01:57,407 --> 00:02:01,407
Shopping on a trip is such a waste. 

53
00:02:01,407 --> 00:02:03,307
- That's not true. / - Things you can only buy there. 

54
00:02:03,307 --> 00:02:05,140
- That's because... / - You can buy limited items. 

55
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:07,307
You shouldn't disregard personal preferences. 

56
00:02:07,307 --> 00:02:09,573
You may think that way for father and son trips. 

57
00:02:09,573 --> 00:02:11,073
But for mothers and daughters, 

58
00:02:11,073 --> 00:02:13,207
it's important to go shopping together 

59
00:02:13,207 --> 00:02:15,807
and pick good items for each other. 

60
00:02:15,807 --> 00:02:17,273
That can't be ignored. 

61
00:02:17,273 --> 00:02:19,373
- Exactly. / - We can also go window-shopping. 

62
00:02:19,373 --> 00:02:21,373
And our trip has a big advantage. 

63
00:02:21,373 --> 00:02:22,673
Hyejin has been... 

64
00:02:22,673 --> 00:02:26,007
- To Hong Kong plenty of times. / - Since long time ago. 

65
00:02:26,007 --> 00:02:27,340
So she's just like a tour guide. 

66
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:28,840
- That's what worries me. / - That's what is scary. 

67
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:29,640
Hong Kong is just Hong Kong, isn't it? 

68
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:32,473
Many people say Hong Kong is 

69
00:02:32,473 --> 00:02:34,507
a great place for shopping. 

70
00:02:34,507 --> 00:02:37,407
- Great night view too. / - But we didn't... 

71
00:02:37,407 --> 00:02:39,107
Want to do typical shopping. 

72
00:02:39,107 --> 00:02:42,507
We did things you would like to do it at least once. 

73
00:02:42,507 --> 00:02:45,973
We saw beautiful nature and had great food. 

74
00:02:45,973 --> 00:02:47,607
- We did a lot of things. / - Nature in Hong Kong? 

75
00:02:47,607 --> 00:02:48,473
Hong Kong does have nature. 

76
00:02:48,473 --> 00:02:50,273
- I can't imagine. / - I haven't seen nature there. 

77
00:02:50,273 --> 00:02:51,807
Hong Kong is a city. 

78
00:02:51,807 --> 00:02:53,740
- And the night view. / - There's actually nature there. 

79
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:54,873
70% of Hong Kong... 

80
00:02:54,873 --> 00:02:56,940
- Hong Kong has forests too. / - Really? 

81
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:59,173
70% of the land of Hong Kong is a green area. 

82
00:02:59,173 --> 00:03:01,340
- Really? / - That's just like Korea. 

83
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:02,440
Yes, it's very similar to Korea. 

84
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:05,207
I heard there's a trekking course we don't know about. 

85
00:03:05,207 --> 00:03:06,307
- Yes. / - Right. 

86
00:03:06,307 --> 00:03:07,573
Did you go hiking? 

87
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,907
- Why? / - That's what we hate the most. 

88
00:03:09,907 --> 00:03:12,240
- Hiking is what we hate the most. / - We went... 

89
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:14,707
We went hiking just once. 

90
00:03:15,273 --> 00:03:17,007
I can help them a bit. 

91
00:03:17,007 --> 00:03:18,673
I used to live in Hong Kong for some time. 

92
00:03:18,673 --> 00:03:19,707
Oh, really? 

93
00:03:19,707 --> 00:03:20,573
When you travel with old people, 

94
00:03:20,573 --> 00:03:22,973
it's hard to travel a long distance. 

95
00:03:22,973 --> 00:03:25,107
Everything in Hong Kong is nearby. 

96
00:03:25,107 --> 00:03:27,407
- You don't have to travel much. / - That's true. 

97
00:03:27,407 --> 00:03:29,507
Traveling can be less tiring and it's an advantage. 

98
00:03:29,507 --> 00:03:31,740
There are places where you can see great night views. 

99
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:33,573
It's nice to dress up and 

100
00:03:33,573 --> 00:03:36,940
have a cocktail with your mother, looking at 

101
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:38,140
the beautiful night view. 

102
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:40,607
And you can take amazing pictures there too. 

103
00:03:40,607 --> 00:03:43,407
I like both Hong Kong and Vietnam but 

104
00:03:43,407 --> 00:03:46,040
among all the travel destinations on Battle Trip, 

105
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:47,607
I think Xiamen is 

106
00:03:47,607 --> 00:03:49,707
the best place to travel with your parents. 

107
00:03:49,707 --> 00:03:54,740
The Yang sisters, Heeeun and Heekyung went there. 

108
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:56,573
They loved the food and... 

109
00:03:56,573 --> 00:03:58,507
- The weather was perfect. / - "I'm going there again." 

110
00:03:58,907 --> 00:03:59,973
"I'm going there again." 

111
00:03:59,973 --> 00:04:03,040
They said they'd go again early next year. 

112
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,740
- "I made reservations." / - I watched that episode. 

113
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:07,507
Xiamen seemed to be worth visiting indeed. 

114
00:04:07,907 --> 00:04:10,773
Is there any other place you'd like to recommend? 

115
00:04:10,773 --> 00:04:15,040
There's an interesting survey regarding family trips. 

116
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,473
An accommodation rental service 

117
00:04:17,473 --> 00:04:19,873
did a survey on the most booked 

118
00:04:19,873 --> 00:04:21,440
family trip destination. 

119
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:24,107
Guess what the most popular family trip destination 

120
00:04:24,107 --> 00:04:25,007
in Korea is. 

121
00:04:25,007 --> 00:04:26,373
- In Korea? / - Busan? 

122
00:04:26,373 --> 00:04:27,407
- Jeju-do. / - Sokcho. 

123
00:04:27,407 --> 00:04:29,307
That's correct. It's Jeju-do. 

124
00:04:29,307 --> 00:04:31,073
Jeju-do is where the most reservations are made. 

125
00:04:31,073 --> 00:04:32,107
- For family trips. / - And? 

126
00:04:32,107 --> 00:04:34,340
Guess which city the Japanese make 

127
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:36,073
the most reservation for family trips. 

128
00:04:36,073 --> 00:04:36,873
- In Japan? / - Fukuoka. 

129
00:04:36,873 --> 00:04:39,707
- Busan? / - It's either Sapporo or Okinawa. 

130
00:04:39,707 --> 00:04:41,373
- Okinawa. / - Yes, it's Okinawa. 

131
00:04:41,373 --> 00:04:42,640
- Okinawa. / - Yes. 

132
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:44,140
It's Okinawa. 

133
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:46,840
- In Japan. / - Now guess which city is... 

134
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:48,240
The most popular among Australians for family trips. 

135
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,140
- Australia? / - Australians? 

136
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:52,507
- New Zealand. / - It's not in Australia. 

137
00:04:52,507 --> 00:04:54,740
- It's not in Australia? / - Is it New Zealand? 

138
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:57,473
- Where is it? / - It's a city in Indonesia. 

139
00:04:57,473 --> 00:04:59,073
- Bali? / - That's correct. 

140
00:04:59,073 --> 00:05:00,740
- Bali. / - Bali. 

141
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:02,973
They go there often because it's close. 

142
00:05:02,973 --> 00:05:05,440
- It's close? / - For a family trip... 

143
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,807
- Somewhere close is preferable. / - That's true. 

144
00:05:07,807 --> 00:05:09,807
- A place with good food. / - You don't go backpacking... 

145
00:05:09,807 --> 00:05:11,373
In Europe with your family. 

146
00:05:11,373 --> 00:05:14,340
- That's true. / - So, we're going to Hong Kong today. 

147
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:15,673
- Finally... / - I want to go to Hong Kong. 

148
00:05:15,673 --> 00:05:17,273
Hyejin, how long does it take to get there? 

149
00:05:17,273 --> 00:05:20,807
It takes about 3.5 to 4 hours... 

150
00:05:20,807 --> 00:05:23,440
- To get to Hong Kong. / - Not only from Incheon but... 

151
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,607
You can fly there from Busan too. 

152
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:25,873
- Busan... / - You can fly there from Daegu too. 

153
00:05:25,873 --> 00:05:27,773
There are flights to Hong Kong in Daegu 

154
00:05:27,773 --> 00:05:29,807
and even Jeju-do every day. 

155
00:05:29,807 --> 00:05:32,673
- There are flights there too? / - That's great. 

156
00:05:32,673 --> 00:05:35,773
When is the best time to... 

157
00:05:35,773 --> 00:05:36,940
- Travel in Hong Kong? / - When should we go? 

158
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:38,607
- November to January. / - January. 

159
00:05:38,607 --> 00:05:39,740
- November to January. / - November to January. 

160
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:42,340
The weather is the best. 

161
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:44,773
- It's not that hot. / - I heard it's very hot in summer. 

162
00:05:44,773 --> 00:05:46,607
- It's very hot. / - It's not hot now. 

163
00:05:46,607 --> 00:05:48,607
It has the perfect weather now. 

164
00:05:48,607 --> 00:05:50,473
- It doesn't rain much either. / - No. 

165
00:05:50,473 --> 00:05:53,673
Anyway, I'm looking forward to seeing their trip since 

166
00:05:53,673 --> 00:05:56,907
they say it's different from the Hong Kong we know. 

167
00:05:56,907 --> 00:05:59,573
Mamma Mia Tour in Hong Kong. 

168
00:05:59,573 --> 00:06:01,273
Let's check it out now. 

169
00:06:04,507 --> 00:06:06,940
(Ina waits for Hyejin) 

170
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:10,340
(While writing questions to ask her) 

171
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:15,173
She likes the feeling of new things. 

172
00:06:15,173 --> 00:06:16,607
It has to look new. 

173
00:06:16,607 --> 00:06:18,840
Ina is so considerate. 

174
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:21,673
Ina is really cute. 

175
00:06:22,107 --> 00:06:24,407
- She's the best. / - Are you known as a scary senior? 

176
00:06:24,407 --> 00:06:25,440
I don't know you very well. 

177
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,440
No, she's known as an easy-going person. 

178
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:28,607
- Hello. / - Hello. 

179
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:29,840
- Hello. / - Hello. 

180
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,040
(Hyejin shows up with her actress aura) 

181
00:06:32,573 --> 00:06:33,907
We have to introduce ourselves. 

182
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:38,373
We're going on a family trip 

183
00:06:38,373 --> 00:06:40,007
and I'm the daughter, Seor Ina. 

184
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:41,873
Hello. 

185
00:06:41,873 --> 00:06:42,873
(Mother, Shim Hyejin) 

186
00:06:42,873 --> 00:06:45,073
I'm Shim Hyejin, who has suddenly become a mother. 

187
00:06:46,173 --> 00:06:47,873
- Suddenly? / - Yes. 

188
00:06:47,873 --> 00:06:49,507
- You're so mean. / - Why? 

189
00:06:49,507 --> 00:06:50,573
Please be my mother. 

190
00:06:50,573 --> 00:06:51,940
(She's so cute) 

191
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:53,740
She's cute indeed. 

192
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:59,007
(Ina was Hyejin's daughter in a drama) 

193
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:05,107
(By playing the mother and daughter) 

194
00:07:06,107 --> 00:07:07,473
(During the 6 months of shooting, they got closer) 

195
00:07:07,473 --> 00:07:08,773
They look alike. 

196
00:07:09,807 --> 00:07:11,607
It seems like they like taking pictures. 

197
00:07:12,773 --> 00:07:15,407
So, we're going to Hong Kong. 

198
00:07:15,407 --> 00:07:17,240
I don't know much about Hong Kong. 

199
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,840
I have never been there. 

200
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:20,240
I'll tell you the truth. 

201
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:23,807
Many things are mixed in Hong Kong. 

202
00:07:23,807 --> 00:07:26,140
- They have Western culture... / - I see. 

203
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:28,207
And a variety of food. 

204
00:07:28,673 --> 00:07:30,840
It's pretty close too. 

205
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:34,807
It takes about 4 to 5 hours from Korea. 

206
00:07:34,807 --> 00:07:38,373
You get off the plane when you're about to be tired. 

207
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:41,740
You shouldn't take your parents too far. 

208
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:43,840
As a child, you'd want to do anything 

209
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:44,607
for your parents, 

210
00:07:44,607 --> 00:07:46,573
but too a long trip can annoy your parents. 

211
00:07:46,573 --> 00:07:48,573
A long plane ride is tiring, 

212
00:07:48,573 --> 00:07:51,107
unless you can offer them first class seats. 

213
00:07:51,107 --> 00:07:52,373
Even that can be tiring too. 

214
00:07:52,373 --> 00:07:53,440
(Unless you can offer good seats, they get tired) 

215
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,340
She knows it well. 

216
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:59,107
My mother won't fly for more than 4 hours. 

217
00:07:59,107 --> 00:08:01,573
- It's hard. / - If it's too far, it can be hard. 

218
00:08:01,573 --> 00:08:03,773
How do you know it so well? 

219
00:08:03,773 --> 00:08:05,907
I can do some bragging if you want. 

220
00:08:05,907 --> 00:08:07,240
(I'm Shin Hyejin) 

221
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:09,907
Nowadays, Hong Kong actors... 

222
00:08:09,907 --> 00:08:11,507
This is annoying. 

223
00:08:11,507 --> 00:08:13,940
Talking about the past isn't a good thing. 

224
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:15,507
- Why? I love it. / - Talking about past... 

225
00:08:15,507 --> 00:08:17,273
Makes you look old. 

226
00:08:17,273 --> 00:08:20,240
I know what she means. "Back in the day..." 

227
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,273
There used to be a production company that 

228
00:08:22,273 --> 00:08:23,373
Director Wong Kar-wai owned. 

229
00:08:23,373 --> 00:08:26,107
I had a contract with them 

230
00:08:26,107 --> 00:08:28,307
and I used to be an actress in that agency. 

231
00:08:28,307 --> 00:08:30,973
Tony Leung Chiu-wai, Maggie Cheung Man-yuk. 

232
00:08:31,607 --> 00:08:34,573
And Gong Li... 

233
00:08:34,573 --> 00:08:36,473
You used to work with these actors? 

234
00:08:36,473 --> 00:08:38,640
We used to be in the same agency. 

235
00:08:40,707 --> 00:08:42,007
Isn't that cool? 

236
00:08:42,007 --> 00:08:45,273
- Hyejin was sensational back then. / - She was. 

237
00:08:45,273 --> 00:08:46,407
She was one of a kind. 

238
00:08:46,407 --> 00:08:48,373
She couldn't be more beautiful. 

239
00:08:48,373 --> 00:08:51,607
(She used to work with Hong Kong's best actors) 

240
00:08:51,607 --> 00:08:53,507
(Hyejin was an iconic actress of the 1990s) 

241
00:08:53,507 --> 00:08:56,373
Back then, I used to visit Hong Kong a lot. 

242
00:08:56,373 --> 00:08:58,007
(Respect) 

243
00:08:58,007 --> 00:09:01,273
I want to look elegant but you don't let me. 

244
00:09:01,273 --> 00:09:02,373
(Where is the elegance?) 

245
00:09:02,373 --> 00:09:03,707
Why am I the one to blame? 

246
00:09:03,707 --> 00:09:05,207
You keep talking to me. 

247
00:09:05,207 --> 00:09:06,807
(I'm usually very elegant, it's your fault) 

248
00:09:06,807 --> 00:09:08,173
I should ask more. 

249
00:09:08,707 --> 00:09:10,440
Think about what you want to do with me... 

250
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:15,040
A place you want me to see. 

251
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:18,673
I'm going to think about the places I want you to see. 

252
00:09:18,673 --> 00:09:20,340
Actually, I already found some. 

253
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:21,507
Really? 

254
00:09:21,773 --> 00:09:23,740
This is the difference between you and me. 

255
00:09:25,007 --> 00:09:27,607
I don't know anything about Hong Kong. 

256
00:09:27,607 --> 00:09:29,307
(Will she manage to plan a nice trip?) 

257
00:09:29,307 --> 00:09:32,507
One of the things I want to do with you is 

258
00:09:32,507 --> 00:09:33,873
trekking. 

259
00:09:33,873 --> 00:09:35,807
You can go hiking in Hong Kong? 

260
00:09:35,807 --> 00:09:38,640
It's the most famous hiking trail in Asia. 

261
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:39,773
This is in Hong Kong? 

262
00:09:40,773 --> 00:09:41,973
I love it. 

263
00:09:41,973 --> 00:09:43,340
Isn't it beautiful? 

264
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:46,207
Last April, I walked 800km on the pilgrimage trail 

265
00:09:46,207 --> 00:09:48,240
of Camino de Santiago. 

266
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,740
Since then, I find hiking so fun. 

267
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:52,673
- You walked 800km? / - Yes. 

268
00:09:52,673 --> 00:09:55,840
After that, I walked 640km in Portugal too. 

269
00:09:57,073 --> 00:09:58,773
- So... / - 800km? 

270
00:09:58,773 --> 00:10:00,540
- 800km and then 640km. / - How long did it take? 

271
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:02,107
I walked over 1,000km. 

272
00:10:02,107 --> 00:10:04,373
Since then, I started to find trekking... 

273
00:10:04,373 --> 00:10:06,840
- You find it fun. / - It's fun and keeps you healthy. 

274
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,007
You should walk too. 

275
00:10:08,007 --> 00:10:09,373
Maybe you should go to the army. 

276
00:10:09,373 --> 00:10:11,640
- I might be a born soldier. / - That's what I mean. 

277
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:13,140
She should go march in the army. 

278
00:10:14,507 --> 00:10:17,973
It was chosen as the best trekking course in Asia. 

279
00:10:17,973 --> 00:10:19,207
(Dragon's Back is the best trekking course in Asia) 

280
00:10:19,207 --> 00:10:22,373
This is one of the things I want to try with you. 

281
00:10:22,373 --> 00:10:25,307
- I'm so touched. / - It's not that big a deal. 

282
00:10:25,307 --> 00:10:27,773
It could be very exhausting. 

283
00:10:27,773 --> 00:10:29,307
You said you have never been hiking before. 

284
00:10:29,307 --> 00:10:31,307
- That's true. / - We can't... 

285
00:10:31,307 --> 00:10:33,640
Do this on the day... 

286
00:10:34,073 --> 00:10:35,840
- We arrive. / - No. 

287
00:10:36,473 --> 00:10:39,973
Since you said you haven't been to Hong Kong, 

288
00:10:39,973 --> 00:10:42,373
we're going to spend 

289
00:10:42,373 --> 00:10:43,940
one day in the city. 

290
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:47,173
Then I'm going to do the research on 

291
00:10:47,173 --> 00:10:48,607
the trekking for the second day. 

292
00:10:48,607 --> 00:10:50,207
That sounds good. You're so smart. 

293
00:10:50,873 --> 00:10:52,573
(Hehe) 

294
00:10:52,573 --> 00:10:54,407
What should be the name of our tour? 

295
00:10:54,407 --> 00:10:57,307
Actually, I have some in my mind. 

296
00:10:57,307 --> 00:10:58,373
What are they? 

297
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:00,573
Mamma Mia. 

298
00:11:00,907 --> 00:11:03,040
- Mamma Mia? / - Mamma Mia means... 

299
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:05,107
Oh, my goodness. 

300
00:11:05,707 --> 00:11:08,473
It means our trip is so great that we will say... 

301
00:11:08,473 --> 00:11:10,573
- I like the idea. / - Mamma Mia. 

302
00:11:10,573 --> 00:11:11,640
Also... 

303
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:14,607
Do you know the saying, "Admire sacrifice?" 

304
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,773
I don't like that saying. 

305
00:11:17,907 --> 00:11:19,340
- So... / - I prefer Mamma Mia. 

306
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:21,707
- Then let's go with Mamma Mia. / - Mamma Mia. 

307
00:11:21,707 --> 00:11:22,973
Let's go with that then. 

308
00:11:24,007 --> 00:11:25,273
I'm well-prepared, right? 

309
00:11:25,273 --> 00:11:27,773
You did a great job. 

310
00:11:27,773 --> 00:11:29,907
I think you two don't really hit it off. 

311
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:32,573
That's not true. 

312
00:11:32,573 --> 00:11:34,173
I don't think she really likes her. 

313
00:11:35,207 --> 00:11:36,107
"You did a great job." 

314
00:11:36,107 --> 00:11:37,873
- That's not how it was. / - Yes, it was. 

315
00:11:38,673 --> 00:11:40,040
Let's make a fun trip 

316
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:44,440
that will make us say Mamma Mia. 

317
00:11:45,873 --> 00:11:48,107
Our trip is already half successful. 

318
00:11:48,107 --> 00:11:49,307
Okay. 

319
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:52,940
(So fashionable no one would believe her age) 

320
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:54,640
What kind of oil is this? 

321
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:55,440
I like it very much. 

322
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,407
I think she's a small size. 

323
00:11:57,407 --> 00:11:59,807
If you spray this, you can be like Natalie Portman. 

324
00:11:59,807 --> 00:12:00,540
I doubt that. 

325
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:02,973
You're feeding me this for breakfast? 

326
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,340
I don't usually give up food, 

327
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:08,407
you're the only one. Eat up. 

328
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:11,940
We'll start at the center of Hong Kong. 

329
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:14,707
Wow. This place is incredible! 

330
00:12:14,707 --> 00:12:17,973
Right? This is the night view of Hong Kong. 

331
00:12:27,307 --> 00:12:32,207
(They make unforgettable memories in Hong Kong) 

332
00:12:32,207 --> 00:12:35,440
It's like a cafe area for youngsters. 

333
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:37,707
It's the best at night... 

334
00:12:37,707 --> 00:12:40,173
- That's the hot pot! / - My gosh! 

335
00:12:40,173 --> 00:12:42,240
- Mamma Mia! / - It's not that spicy. 

336
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,107
I really love mala sauce. 

337
00:12:44,107 --> 00:12:45,773
- The itinerary looks impressive. / - Hot pot. 

338
00:12:46,073 --> 00:12:48,940
I can't believe I'm on a ferry in Hong Kong. 

339
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:50,240
I'm excited. 

340
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:53,907
It doesn't have a scent. 

341
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:56,873
You're much prettier. 

342
00:12:58,007 --> 00:13:02,773
I'll organize everything for the trekking day. 

343
00:13:04,507 --> 00:13:08,007
It's the most famous crab restaurant here. 

344
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:10,273
They have crab here too! 

345
00:13:10,273 --> 00:13:12,107
- What is that? / - This is cheating! 

346
00:13:12,107 --> 00:13:12,807
My goodness. 

347
00:13:12,807 --> 00:13:15,707
- Goodness. / - Fried crabs are too good! 

348
00:13:16,407 --> 00:13:21,773
It's the most famous crab restaurant here. 

349
00:13:21,773 --> 00:13:25,707
(Ina's Day for Hyejin) 

350
00:13:26,007 --> 00:13:32,073
(The trip is full of laughter from a mother and daughter) 

351
00:13:32,073 --> 00:13:33,273
My husband. 

352
00:13:33,273 --> 00:13:34,373
No! 

353
00:13:34,373 --> 00:13:35,973
(The trip is also full of surprises and amazement) 

354
00:13:35,973 --> 00:13:37,973
My goodness. You scared me. 

355
00:13:38,707 --> 00:13:41,473
- The weather was really good. / - Mamma Mia! 

356
00:13:41,473 --> 00:13:42,073
It was the best. 

357
00:13:42,073 --> 00:13:44,373
You can clearly see the difference between 

358
00:13:44,373 --> 00:13:45,773
the guy-guy trip and girl-girl trip. 

359
00:13:45,773 --> 00:13:47,273
The atmosphere looks so different. 

360
00:13:49,807 --> 00:13:51,440
(Hong Kong) 

361
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:54,340
(4-hour flight, 1 hour behind Korea) 

362
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:57,173
(Koreans don't require a visa to stay up to 90 days) 

363
00:13:58,107 --> 00:14:02,840
(Arrival at Hong Kong International Airport at 7 p.m.) 

364
00:14:03,607 --> 00:14:05,807
- We're finally in Hong Kong. / - It's Hong Kong. 

365
00:14:05,807 --> 00:14:08,440
Yes, we arrived. I shouldn't have dressed up. 

366
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:09,440
It's hot. 

367
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,273
- Right? / - I didn't know it'd be this hot. 

368
00:14:11,273 --> 00:14:12,273
Let's get moving first. 

369
00:14:12,273 --> 00:14:15,007
(How to go to the city center from Hong Kong Airport) 

370
00:14:15,007 --> 00:14:18,740
(Bus, train and taxi) 

371
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:22,373
We'll go by taxi today. 

372
00:14:22,373 --> 00:14:23,440
Okay! 

373
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,507
(Feeling excited) 

374
00:14:24,507 --> 00:14:26,073
There are three types of taxis here. 

375
00:14:26,073 --> 00:14:30,373
There are red taxis, green taxis and blue taxis. 

376
00:14:30,373 --> 00:14:34,373
Red taxis can go anywhere in Hong Kong. 

377
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:36,473
- Anywhere? / - Yes, anywhere. 

378
00:14:36,473 --> 00:14:39,307
- Green ones go to New Territories. / - They're different. 

379
00:14:39,307 --> 00:14:40,873
- You should write this down. / - Right. 

380
00:14:40,873 --> 00:14:42,440
(Blue taxis operate only in Lantau Island) 

381
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:43,707
When you get on the taxi, 

382
00:14:43,707 --> 00:14:45,607
you can't just choose any one. 

383
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:47,773
I'm saying that you should find out first. 

384
00:14:47,773 --> 00:14:51,173
If you can, picking up the red taxi... 

385
00:14:51,173 --> 00:14:52,407
- Is probably wise. / - Red taxis. 

386
00:14:52,407 --> 00:14:54,173
- You "pick up" taxis? / - Wait. 

387
00:14:54,173 --> 00:14:56,007
- Picking it up is better? / - "Pick up?" 

388
00:14:56,007 --> 00:14:57,607
Pick up a taxi and get in. 

389
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:59,207
Let's get some rest today 

390
00:14:59,207 --> 00:15:00,740
and start our day early tomorrow. 

391
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:01,707
Okay. 

392
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:03,773
There are a lot of red taxis. 

393
00:15:04,073 --> 00:15:05,407
- There are mostly red taxis. / - Yes. 

394
00:15:05,407 --> 00:15:07,240
- Mostly red taxis. / - He's driving with the trunk open. 

395
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:10,807
(30 minutes to the Central from the airport by taxi) 

396
00:15:10,807 --> 00:15:13,307
Hong Kong Island and Kowloon are separated. 

397
00:15:13,307 --> 00:15:14,307
- Right. / - Yes. 

398
00:15:14,307 --> 00:15:19,340
(The first day of Mamma Mia Tour arrives) 

399
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:23,373
(Hong Kong City Hall, international bank headquarters) 

400
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:31,173
(Big shopping mall, small stores make up the area) 

401
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:38,207
(A lot of tourists visit this area) 

402
00:15:38,207 --> 00:15:39,740
This part of the island is lively. 

403
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:44,140
This is the city. 

404
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:46,773
(Central, the heart of Hong Kong) 

405
00:15:46,773 --> 00:15:49,473
- It's the first day of our trip. / - Yes. 

406
00:15:49,473 --> 00:15:51,940
This is the first day I planned for us. 

407
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:54,240
That's why we're going to 

408
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:57,307
start off our trip in the center of Hong Kong, Central. 

409
00:15:57,307 --> 00:15:59,273
Everything is around here. 

410
00:15:59,273 --> 00:16:01,573
Everything we need to see and food we need to eat. 

411
00:16:01,573 --> 00:16:03,640
Well, everyone has a different opinion 

412
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:05,040
but this is just what I think. 

413
00:16:07,273 --> 00:16:08,673
That's a laugh of an actress. 

414
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:10,240
She laughs at what she says. 

415
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:12,407
She sounded like Franceska from "Hello, Franceska." 

416
00:16:12,407 --> 00:16:14,507
My laugh sounds terrible. 

417
00:16:15,173 --> 00:16:16,307
It sounds refreshing and nice. 

418
00:16:16,307 --> 00:16:18,373
Aren't we in the financial district? 

419
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:20,040
There are things to do here, right? 

420
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:21,207
(Big buildings don't look fun for her) 

421
00:16:21,207 --> 00:16:23,307
- Gosh. / - It looked like a financial district. 

422
00:16:23,307 --> 00:16:25,340
- It looks like Yeouido. / - Yeouido? 

423
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:27,240
- We'll get going now. / - Go, go. 

424
00:16:27,807 --> 00:16:30,073
Where are we going first? Is it a secret? 

425
00:16:30,073 --> 00:16:31,940
I have prepared this for you. 

426
00:16:36,273 --> 00:16:39,540
(24 minutes to Hollywood murals from Ferris wheel) 

427
00:16:40,907 --> 00:16:43,040
(They go into the financial district) 

428
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:46,007
Goodness, it's completely different from Ha Long Bay. 

429
00:16:46,007 --> 00:16:47,873
It's so crowded. How do you walk around there? 

430
00:16:47,873 --> 00:16:49,840
- How do you walk there? / - So many people. 

431
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:52,273
When you go traveling, it's also fun 

432
00:16:52,273 --> 00:16:55,040
to observe people from all over the world. 

433
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,207
That's the best. 

434
00:16:57,373 --> 00:17:01,407
This street is a famous one in Hong Kong. 

435
00:17:01,407 --> 00:17:04,873
This is called the Hollywood Road 

436
00:17:04,873 --> 00:17:07,040
where people take a lot of photos. 

437
00:17:07,573 --> 00:17:08,940
Hollywood Road? 

438
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:11,007
Yes, there's a street called Hollywood Road. 

439
00:17:12,773 --> 00:17:14,307
I'm curious about Hollywood Road. 

440
00:17:15,073 --> 00:17:17,707
There are many places you can take the best photos. 

441
00:17:17,707 --> 00:17:20,273
- What's this? / - There are a lot of cool places. 

442
00:17:24,607 --> 00:17:27,640
- My goodness! / - There are a lot of murals. 

443
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:28,373
Wow, so pretty. 

444
00:17:28,373 --> 00:17:30,940
- That looks so cool. / - Hong Kong changed a lot. 

445
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:32,507
It doesn't seem like Hong Kong. 

446
00:17:32,507 --> 00:17:33,640
They're all mothers and daughters. 

447
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:35,707
I don't see any dads and sons. 

448
00:17:35,707 --> 00:17:37,107
- You're right. / - This is pretty. 

449
00:17:37,107 --> 00:17:38,873
- Every alley looks pretty. / - Right? Isn't it pretty? 

450
00:17:38,873 --> 00:17:41,307
Do you see that one, decorated with the red sign? 

451
00:17:41,707 --> 00:17:42,907
They decorated the place with flowers. 

452
00:17:42,907 --> 00:17:45,373
- That was my favorite. / - I thought we could... 

453
00:17:45,373 --> 00:17:47,307
Go over there and take photos. 

454
00:17:47,307 --> 00:17:48,140
- I love it. / - Shall we cross? 

455
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:50,540
- So pretty. / - People must take many photos there. 

456
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:53,273
This way. Stand here so we can include the sign. 

457
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,840
- Isn't it too far? / - That's it. That's the spot. 

458
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:58,940
Move up a bit. Move forward. Okay. 

459
00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:00,340
(Taking a photo with her isn't easy) 

460
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:01,807
1, 2, 3. 

461
00:18:01,807 --> 00:18:03,073
I bet the photo came out nice. 

462
00:18:03,073 --> 00:18:04,740
(First photo as mom and daughter in Hong Kong) 

463
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:06,073
They look pretty. 

464
00:18:06,073 --> 00:18:07,107
What did we do on our trip? 

465
00:18:07,107 --> 00:18:10,473
- We should've taken photos too. / - Great photo. 

466
00:18:10,473 --> 00:18:12,840
- Exactly. / - You took one at the subway. 

467
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:14,840
- Subway? / - Subway? Wasn't it on the plane? 

468
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:16,240
It wasn't a plane. It was the subway. 

469
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:18,640
It was the subway with the seatbelt. 

470
00:18:19,373 --> 00:18:20,907
It was more like a bus. 

471
00:18:20,907 --> 00:18:23,807
We can go to another one from here. 

472
00:18:23,807 --> 00:18:25,973
When we cross this street, 

473
00:18:25,973 --> 00:18:29,973
we'll see the murals where people take a lot of photos. 

474
00:18:29,973 --> 00:18:32,173
I'm planning to go there. Come follow me. 

475
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:36,240
Let's cross the street. 

476
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,973
(It's the mural of the old town) 

477
00:18:37,973 --> 00:18:39,907
You have to wait in line to take the photos. 

478
00:18:39,907 --> 00:18:41,540
The mural is pretty. 

479
00:18:43,573 --> 00:18:44,707
This is the place. 

480
00:18:45,807 --> 00:18:47,707
- This is it. / - You need some people there. 

481
00:18:47,707 --> 00:18:49,507
- Only then it feels like a trip. / - Right. 

482
00:18:49,507 --> 00:18:51,273
Gosh, it looks really pretty. 

483
00:18:51,273 --> 00:18:55,240
(They take another photo by the wall) 

484
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:56,173
Your hand is shaking. 

485
00:18:56,173 --> 00:18:58,473
- I couldn't tap the button. / - Right? 

486
00:19:00,073 --> 00:19:02,273
(They take another photo by the wall) 

487
00:19:02,773 --> 00:19:04,840
(Starting now, we're the cool kids of Hong Kong) 

488
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:06,407
- How beautiful. / - "Cool kids of Hong Kong." 

489
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:09,007
(They spend some time together as they walk) 

490
00:19:09,007 --> 00:19:10,940
Gosh, women love this kind of walk. 

491
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:13,440
Every store here looks cute. 

492
00:19:13,907 --> 00:19:15,973
Can you take a photo of me here? 

493
00:19:16,607 --> 00:19:19,273
- Do I look okay? / - They're taking photos all day. 

494
00:19:19,273 --> 00:19:21,007
(Acting playful) 

495
00:19:21,007 --> 00:19:23,340
- I took so many photos of her. / - I can see that. 

496
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:24,940
What did you do with those photos? 

497
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:26,673
- I sent them to her. / - Did you save them? 

498
00:19:26,673 --> 00:19:29,273
- I have them. I sent them. / - Was it your first time? 

499
00:19:29,273 --> 00:19:30,507
Yes, it was my first time in Hong Kong. 

500
00:19:30,507 --> 00:19:31,973
- Then this must be fun. / - All done. 

501
00:19:31,973 --> 00:19:34,907
(She never said they were good photos) 

502
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:37,307
(They take a selfie together) 

503
00:19:37,307 --> 00:19:38,807
Why are you doing that with your lips? 

504
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:41,540
She doesn't take ordinary photos often. 

505
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:42,807
I'm sorry to point it out 

506
00:19:42,807 --> 00:19:44,807
but don't try to read women's minds. 

507
00:19:44,807 --> 00:19:47,340
- Just understand them. / - I was merely asking. 

508
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:48,973
She took the photo just like this. 

509
00:19:48,973 --> 00:19:50,607
We just made faces to take our photos. 

510
00:19:51,873 --> 00:19:54,407
(Jungyu has a hard time understanding them) 

511
00:19:55,607 --> 00:19:57,040
We don't look normal in any of these photos. 

512
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:58,640
We're not normal. 

513
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:01,340
(We only keep good photos) 

514
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:03,873
We should get something to eat now. 

515
00:20:03,873 --> 00:20:06,240
- Great, great. I'm full of energy. / - Let's eat. 

516
00:20:06,673 --> 00:20:08,040
(Hyejin's Day for Ina) 

517
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:10,473
- Brunch! / - Wow, that photo's nice too. 

518
00:20:11,073 --> 00:20:12,107
Brunch. 

519
00:20:12,107 --> 00:20:15,173
(9-minute walk to the brunch place from the murals) 

520
00:20:15,173 --> 00:20:16,673
It's quite close. 

521
00:20:16,673 --> 00:20:20,140
So, for Ina today... 

522
00:20:20,873 --> 00:20:25,507
I looked up a nice brunch restaurant. 

523
00:20:25,507 --> 00:20:26,640
You did? 

524
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,073
Ta-da! 

525
00:20:28,073 --> 00:20:30,207
I think I know where it is. Isn't that it? 

526
00:20:30,207 --> 00:20:31,540
- Isn't it pretty? / - When I'm in Hong Kong... 

527
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:33,273
I feel as if I should have brunch. 

528
00:20:33,273 --> 00:20:34,407
- Right? / - Once you get the dish... 

529
00:20:34,407 --> 00:20:36,007
- There's not much to eat. / - No. 

530
00:20:36,007 --> 00:20:38,273
- You enjoy the ambience there. / - It's sweet too. 

531
00:20:38,273 --> 00:20:41,440
Don't you agree? Even when you drink coffee... 

532
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,907
- You want a cute cafe. / - Thanks to Hwangbo... 

533
00:20:43,907 --> 00:20:44,840
I got to visit Hong Kong. 

534
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:46,207
There were many great brunch places. 

535
00:20:46,207 --> 00:20:47,507
- There are a lot. / - That's true. 

536
00:20:48,407 --> 00:20:50,340
She knows more 

537
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:52,773
hip and cute places than I do. 

538
00:20:52,773 --> 00:20:54,207
And she enjoys them more. 

539
00:20:54,207 --> 00:20:55,207
It's so interesting. 

540
00:20:55,207 --> 00:20:59,440
(This cute brunch joint charms the daughter in her 20s) 

541
00:21:01,573 --> 00:21:06,473
(This is the brunch, prepared just for Ina) 

542
00:21:06,973 --> 00:21:08,840
- That's so pretty. / - That has to be tasty. 

543
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:12,873
(Sour cream) 

544
00:21:12,873 --> 00:21:14,940
(Salsa sauce) 

545
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:15,740
(Avocado) 

546
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:17,573
- Avocados! / - Yes, avocados. 

547
00:21:17,573 --> 00:21:20,973
- My wife cooks me that. / - That looks so good. 

548
00:21:21,873 --> 00:21:22,873
This... 

549
00:21:25,573 --> 00:21:28,473
(Avocado toast) 

550
00:21:28,473 --> 00:21:30,707
That's too much for brunch. 

551
00:21:31,407 --> 00:21:32,740
- Right? Isn't the portion big? / - It's so pretty. 

552
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:34,140
It's supposed to be. It's for breakfast and lunch. 

553
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:36,440
It's almost lunch. This is almost our lunch. 

554
00:21:38,707 --> 00:21:39,773
- It looks delicious. / - My gosh. 

555
00:21:39,773 --> 00:21:42,107
- What's that? / - "Pumpkin spinach egg pie." 

556
00:21:42,107 --> 00:21:43,307
- Gosh. / - Goodness, look at that. 

557
00:21:43,873 --> 00:21:45,673
- They named it after everything. / - That looks good. 

558
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:48,040
They included all the ingredients. 

559
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:50,440
Pumpkin spinach egg pie. 

560
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:52,607
Jungyu, that's Sikyung's job. 

561
00:21:52,607 --> 00:21:53,973
Why are you attacking them? 

562
00:21:53,973 --> 00:21:54,973
I'm sorry. 

563
00:21:54,973 --> 00:21:57,507
- I love it. My job became easy. / - It's nice? 

564
00:21:57,507 --> 00:21:59,307
They used all of the ingredients. 

565
00:21:59,807 --> 00:22:02,240
(Mamma Mia Tour picks the table outside) 

566
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,207
Don't brunches taste all the same? 

567
00:22:04,207 --> 00:22:06,773
- You think... / - I think they all taste the same. 

568
00:22:06,773 --> 00:22:09,840
You should get rid of that prejudice. 

569
00:22:10,673 --> 00:22:12,507
(At that time, someone knocks on the window) 

570
00:22:13,073 --> 00:22:15,573
- My gosh, through the window? / - Goodness. 

571
00:22:15,573 --> 00:22:17,007
- My goodness. / - Who is that? 

572
00:22:17,007 --> 00:22:18,673
They serve through the window? 

573
00:22:18,673 --> 00:22:20,073
They serve food that way? 

574
00:22:20,073 --> 00:22:21,240
They served it through the window. 

575
00:22:21,907 --> 00:22:23,673
- Okay. Thank you. / - Goodness. 

576
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:26,073
- Thank you. / - You're welcome. 

577
00:22:26,073 --> 00:22:30,373
(Avocado toast, pumpkin spinach egg pie, $15 each) 

578
00:22:30,373 --> 00:22:32,073
I'll cut it. Try it. 

579
00:22:32,073 --> 00:22:34,240
It doesn't taste good when it's cold. 

580
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,707
Thank you. 

581
00:22:35,707 --> 00:22:37,540
I'm really clumsy. 

582
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:39,240
What if I drop it on you? 

583
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:43,140
(Hyejin cuts it for her) 

584
00:22:44,007 --> 00:22:45,107
(Happy) 

585
00:22:45,107 --> 00:22:46,740
And now, you'll feed me. 

586
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:53,173
How does it taste? 

587
00:22:53,173 --> 00:22:54,307
Isn't it good? 

588
00:22:54,307 --> 00:22:55,507
(She can't speak, so she claps) 

589
00:22:55,507 --> 00:22:57,473
It's a bit salty 

590
00:22:57,473 --> 00:22:58,607
but this is good. 

591
00:22:58,607 --> 00:23:00,907
Food is a bit salty in Hong Kong. 

592
00:23:00,907 --> 00:23:02,873
- You're right. / - "Can't believe I ate something green." 

593
00:23:02,873 --> 00:23:03,907
Because the weather is hot. 

594
00:23:03,907 --> 00:23:05,740
When you order fried rice in Hong Kong, 

595
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:07,807
you have to ask them to make it less salty. 

596
00:23:07,807 --> 00:23:10,407
Even when you ask them to make it less salty... 

597
00:23:10,407 --> 00:23:12,707
- It's still salty for us. / - It is. 

598
00:23:12,707 --> 00:23:13,840
This is good. 

599
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:17,173
I can't believe I ate something green. 

600
00:23:17,173 --> 00:23:19,573
(Hyejin takes a bite too) 

601
00:23:19,573 --> 00:23:20,973
I don't usually eat vegetables. 

602
00:23:20,973 --> 00:23:22,640
What's salty is... 

603
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,373
- The salami. / - Salami makes it salty. 

604
00:23:24,373 --> 00:23:25,973
I think I ate too much salami earlier. 

605
00:23:26,507 --> 00:23:30,040
(If you eat salty salami with avocado) 

606
00:23:31,507 --> 00:23:33,373
Foreigners would love it. 

607
00:23:34,507 --> 00:23:36,940
Avocado is the best. 

608
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:38,473
Avocado is rich. 

609
00:23:39,140 --> 00:23:41,107
The tomato sauce is fresh. 

610
00:23:41,107 --> 00:23:42,740
I think that'll taste good because of avocado. 

611
00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:44,173
Yes, that was good. 

612
00:23:44,173 --> 00:23:46,640
I don't usually eat green vegetables. 

613
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:48,340
- Why not? / - I don't eat avocado. 

614
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:49,407
(I hate vegetables) 

615
00:23:49,407 --> 00:23:50,907
I don't think they're tasty. 

616
00:23:50,907 --> 00:23:52,540
- You have to. You're an adult now. / - It's delicious. 

617
00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:53,907
Thanks to Hyejin... 

618
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:56,340
- Did you eat them all? / - I did. 

619
00:23:56,340 --> 00:24:00,707
Take avocado, egg and ham. 

620
00:24:00,707 --> 00:24:03,073
You have to eat everything together 

621
00:24:03,073 --> 00:24:04,140
for a good balance. 

622
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:06,073
I think I only ate the salty things earlier. 

623
00:24:08,007 --> 00:24:08,873
(She'll try the sweet pumpkin spinach pie) 

624
00:24:08,873 --> 00:24:10,440
It's pretty inside. 

625
00:24:11,007 --> 00:24:12,273
Sweet pumpkin. 

626
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:15,173
Spinach. 

627
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:17,607
I'm curious about this. 

628
00:24:17,607 --> 00:24:19,973
- What is it? / - Sweet pumpkin spinach pie. 

629
00:24:19,973 --> 00:24:21,973
(She reacts as soon as she eats it) 

630
00:24:22,507 --> 00:24:23,707
It's sweet. 

631
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:26,707
- What does it taste like? / - She takes a big bite. 

632
00:24:26,707 --> 00:24:27,807
She does. 

633
00:24:28,473 --> 00:24:30,873
She does that thing with her eyes as well. 

634
00:24:30,873 --> 00:24:32,307
We have the eyes too. 

635
00:24:32,307 --> 00:24:34,940
- That team has Sandeul. / - I guess that's the trend. 

636
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:35,973
- Yes. / - Yes. 

637
00:24:35,973 --> 00:24:38,440
Sandeul's eyes aren't that big though. 

638
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:39,707
I was so surprised. 

639
00:24:41,973 --> 00:24:43,973
When I saw it, 

640
00:24:43,973 --> 00:24:45,873
I thought it wouldn't taste good. 

641
00:24:45,873 --> 00:24:48,273
But this is much more delicious, right? 

642
00:24:49,007 --> 00:24:54,107
(It looks like it's completely wrapped with spinach) 

643
00:24:54,807 --> 00:24:56,040
I can't taste the spinach. 

644
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:57,473
The sweet pumpkin is overpowering. 

645
00:24:57,473 --> 00:25:00,873
- Inside is sweet pumpkin. / - It's like steamed egg. 

646
00:25:00,873 --> 00:25:04,340
It's sweet and the spinach is crunchy. 

647
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:06,140
- Steamed egg? / - Crunchy spinach. 

648
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:08,173
(Sweet pumpkin's sweetness) 

649
00:25:08,173 --> 00:25:10,573
Because of sweet pumpkin, it's not so rich... 

650
00:25:11,073 --> 00:25:12,207
Yet sweet. 

651
00:25:13,207 --> 00:25:15,773
It's because of sweet pumpkin. 

652
00:25:15,773 --> 00:25:17,240
This is kimchi. 

653
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:19,040
- Kimchi? / - This. 

654
00:25:19,507 --> 00:25:21,073
This vegetable. 

655
00:25:21,073 --> 00:25:22,507
When it's too sweet. 

656
00:25:22,507 --> 00:25:24,807
- Sweet and salty. / - There's spinach on the side. 

657
00:25:24,807 --> 00:25:26,807
That's spinach. 

658
00:25:26,807 --> 00:25:29,273
That egg probably isn't steamed egg. 

659
00:25:29,273 --> 00:25:30,873
Is it fried? 

660
00:25:30,873 --> 00:25:34,107
They mixed it with cream. So it's like custard. 

661
00:25:34,107 --> 00:25:36,040
- You're right. / - It's egg based. 

662
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:37,173
It's not steamed egg. 

663
00:25:37,173 --> 00:25:39,040
I hate vegetables. 

664
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:43,007
People who don't like vegetables should 

665
00:25:43,007 --> 00:25:44,540
have the sweet pumpkin spinach pie. 

666
00:25:45,773 --> 00:25:48,140
(Suddenly she's reminded of their first encounter) 

667
00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:49,840
I met you in "Strong Girl Bong-soon." 

668
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:52,207
Do you remember that I was in that drama? 

669
00:25:52,207 --> 00:25:53,607
I never saw you once. 

670
00:25:53,607 --> 00:25:55,007
After that... 

671
00:25:55,007 --> 00:25:58,140
I was a total rookie and I was so nervous then. 

672
00:25:58,140 --> 00:25:59,907
In "Sunny Again Tomorrow..." 

673
00:26:00,407 --> 00:26:03,540
You played my mom. 

674
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:04,840
I was worried 

675
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:07,073
but you thought I was really cute and lovely. 

676
00:26:07,073 --> 00:26:11,007
One time, I was watching you like this from afar, 

677
00:26:11,007 --> 00:26:13,607
you were so pretty. 

678
00:26:13,607 --> 00:26:16,040
- I'm not just saying this. / - I fell in love at first sight. 

679
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:18,407
"Should I take a picture?" I wasn't close to you then. 

680
00:26:18,407 --> 00:26:20,773
So I took a picture of you secretly. 

681
00:26:20,773 --> 00:26:22,040
I shouldn't have. 

682
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:24,007
I was looking at the screen 

683
00:26:24,007 --> 00:26:25,540
and our eyes met. 

684
00:26:25,540 --> 00:26:27,673
On the screen. 

685
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:31,873
So I made a finger heart. 

686
00:26:31,873 --> 00:26:33,240
And you 

687
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:34,807
made a finger heart back. 

688
00:26:35,673 --> 00:26:38,573
So I decided to send you a text message then. 

689
00:26:38,573 --> 00:26:39,840
I think... 

690
00:26:40,507 --> 00:26:42,607
You're so lovely. 

691
00:26:42,607 --> 00:26:44,007
You're really lovely. 

692
00:26:44,507 --> 00:26:47,273
You're very friendly too. 

693
00:26:47,273 --> 00:26:50,607
I thought you were very sociable. 

694
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:54,707
(Shocked) 

695
00:26:54,707 --> 00:26:56,507
- What? / - What is it? 

696
00:26:56,507 --> 00:26:57,940
- Was it a bug? / - An insect. 

697
00:26:58,707 --> 00:27:00,073
You scared me. 

698
00:27:00,073 --> 00:27:01,940
I guess there was something in the food. 

699
00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:03,173
"Something in the food." 

700
00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:05,040
From the food. 

701
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:06,707
A bird came out of the food. 

702
00:27:07,807 --> 00:27:08,907
So cute. 

703
00:27:08,907 --> 00:27:10,640
Goodness. That scared me. 

704
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:15,473
(Cute) 

705
00:27:15,473 --> 00:27:17,740
- That's cute. / - It's so pretty. 

706
00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:19,173
It's cute. Why do you hate it? 

707
00:27:19,173 --> 00:27:20,773
- Why? / - It's cute. 

708
00:27:20,773 --> 00:27:21,940
It's so cute. 

709
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:24,040
(The bird flies away) 

710
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:25,707
Wasn't that so cute? 

711
00:27:25,707 --> 00:27:26,740
(Relieved) 

712
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:29,007
- That was so cute. / - I'm really scared of birds. 

713
00:27:29,007 --> 00:27:31,573
So, we finished breakfast. 

714
00:27:31,573 --> 00:27:34,073
- I think this is enough, right? / - Yes, totally. 

715
00:27:34,073 --> 00:27:35,173
- I'm so full. / - Yes. 

716
00:27:35,173 --> 00:27:36,473
We'll go somewhere else. 

717
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:38,173
Where? 

718
00:27:38,673 --> 00:27:40,540
There was something you wanted to do. 

719
00:27:40,540 --> 00:27:41,940
- Something I wanted to do? / - Yes. 

720
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:44,107
We'll try on qipao. 

721
00:27:44,807 --> 00:27:47,373
- Can we rent qipao? / - She remembered. 

722
00:27:47,373 --> 00:27:49,040
- We can. / - Not buy it? 

723
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:50,340
You can if you want to. 

724
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:52,073
But just rent it. 

725
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:55,107
You aren't going to wear it in Korea anyway. 

726
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:58,007
- For the memory. / - You can try it on... 

727
00:27:58,007 --> 00:27:59,107
And take pictures. 

728
00:27:59,107 --> 00:28:00,307
Just enjoy it. 

729
00:28:00,307 --> 00:28:01,707
I'll take you there. 

730
00:28:01,707 --> 00:28:04,173
- You can rent it. / - Even if you buy qipao... 

731
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:06,140
- You wouldn't wear it. / - Would you wear it? 

732
00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:09,807
- Unless it's Halloween. / - You won't get to wear it. 

733
00:28:09,807 --> 00:28:11,573
- It's really pretty though. / - Right. 

734
00:28:11,573 --> 00:28:12,673
It's so pretty. 

735
00:28:12,673 --> 00:28:15,740
There's something I really want to do. 

736
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:20,273
I want to wear their traditional dress. 

737
00:28:20,273 --> 00:28:22,007
- Traditional Hong Kong dress. / - Qipao. 

738
00:28:22,007 --> 00:28:23,140
This? 

739
00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:25,740
The dress Maggie wore in "In the Mood for Love?" 

740
00:28:26,473 --> 00:28:28,173
- She called her Maggie. / - Maggie. 

741
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:31,973
- Maggie? / - You sound like her friend. 

742
00:28:31,973 --> 00:28:33,973
Doesn't everyone say that? 

743
00:28:33,973 --> 00:28:35,173
People say that. 

744
00:28:35,173 --> 00:28:37,307
I call Chow Yun-fat by his first name too. 

745
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:39,540
- Okay. / - What do you think? 

746
00:28:39,540 --> 00:28:40,940
- It's pretty. / - Don't you think it'll be pretty? 

747
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:42,140
You'll look really pretty. 

748
00:28:42,140 --> 00:28:43,507
- You'll be prettier. / - No. 

749
00:28:43,507 --> 00:28:45,240
I can't wear it because of my fat belly. 

750
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:47,307
(I'm sorry, I can't wear it) 

751
00:28:47,307 --> 00:28:49,473
- You have to wear it too. / - I'm sorry. 

752
00:28:49,473 --> 00:28:52,640
I have to wear a big size then. 

753
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:53,773
It'll be embarrassing. 

754
00:28:54,340 --> 00:28:55,540
(What will the qipao look like?) 

755
00:28:55,540 --> 00:28:57,207
We won't reveal the size. 

756
00:28:57,207 --> 00:28:58,807
Okay. Goodness. 

757
00:29:00,807 --> 00:29:05,273
(9 minutes from the brunch place to qipao) 

758
00:29:05,273 --> 00:29:07,707
I'll let you try qipao on. 

759
00:29:07,707 --> 00:29:09,907
Because you wanted to wear it... 

760
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:14,073
We're here to do that. 

761
00:29:14,073 --> 00:29:15,240
We're almost there. 

762
00:29:15,907 --> 00:29:18,473
(Let's hurry up and go) 

763
00:29:19,373 --> 00:29:20,673
- Hello. / - Hello. 

764
00:29:22,107 --> 00:29:23,907
- Can I come in? / - Yes. 

765
00:29:23,907 --> 00:29:25,907
(Excited) 

766
00:29:27,707 --> 00:29:29,740
- That's pretty. / - So fancy. 

767
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:31,340
- The colors... / - Yes. 

768
00:29:31,340 --> 00:29:33,040
And the patterns are so extravagant. 

769
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:35,907
When you rent qipao, you can borrow... 

770
00:29:35,907 --> 00:29:38,007
- The accessories for free. / - Really? 

771
00:29:38,007 --> 00:29:40,107
- Yes. / - You can borrow them. 

772
00:29:40,107 --> 00:29:42,407
(Qipao can be rented for $98 per day) 

773
00:29:42,907 --> 00:29:45,440
A father and son would never go there. 

774
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:47,540
Father and son wouldn't even look at that place. 

775
00:29:47,540 --> 00:29:49,773
I'd say, "What is that place?" and just walk by. 

776
00:29:49,773 --> 00:29:52,040
They'd be scared to even look. 

777
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:53,140
This is pretty too. 

778
00:29:53,540 --> 00:29:55,707
- Because you have a nice body. / - Me... 

779
00:29:56,507 --> 00:29:58,373
I ate too much at the brunch place though. 

780
00:29:59,007 --> 00:30:00,207
This is pretty too. 

781
00:30:00,673 --> 00:30:02,273
This is pretty too. 

782
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:04,040
I think this will be pretty. 

783
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:05,207
This is really pretty. 

784
00:30:05,207 --> 00:30:07,173
- She keeps recommending things. / - Look at this. 

785
00:30:07,173 --> 00:30:09,907
I want to go to the bathroom first. 

786
00:30:09,907 --> 00:30:10,973
Really? 

787
00:30:12,573 --> 00:30:13,907
I think this is pretty too. 

788
00:30:13,907 --> 00:30:19,840
(Hyejin picks out pretty qipaos for Ina) 

789
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:20,873
How is this? 

790
00:30:20,873 --> 00:30:22,673
- Did you pick these out? / - Yes. 

791
00:30:22,673 --> 00:30:24,107
Hyejin picked them out for me. 

792
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:26,873
I like that one. 

793
00:30:27,407 --> 00:30:29,607
Do you wear small? 

794
00:30:29,607 --> 00:30:31,073
- Maybe medium. / - Medium? 

795
00:30:31,073 --> 00:30:33,140
The retailer said I was a medium. 

796
00:30:33,140 --> 00:30:35,607
It's because I ate too much. I'm sorry. 

797
00:30:36,373 --> 00:30:37,873
- Do I put it on now? / - Yes. 

798
00:30:39,073 --> 00:30:40,407
- How about you? / - Me? 

799
00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:43,507
- You have to wear it too. / - No, thank you. 

800
00:30:44,407 --> 00:30:46,007
I don't want to be compared to you. 

801
00:30:46,707 --> 00:30:48,173
You have a much nicer body. 

802
00:30:48,173 --> 00:30:49,473
Stop talking. 

803
00:30:50,373 --> 00:30:52,540
- I think she'd look pretty in it. / - Yes. 

804
00:30:53,073 --> 00:30:55,340
Just the daughter needs to look pretty. 

805
00:30:56,707 --> 00:31:00,973
(Later) 

806
00:31:00,973 --> 00:31:02,507
Hyejin. 

807
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:04,140
That's pretty. 

808
00:31:04,673 --> 00:31:06,673
- She's pretty. / - It looks good on her. 

809
00:31:06,673 --> 00:31:07,773
Mom. 

810
00:31:08,540 --> 00:31:10,540
(Ina bursts out laughing) 

811
00:31:10,540 --> 00:31:11,507
Goodness. My husband. 

812
00:31:11,507 --> 00:31:13,173
Pretty dress for the pretty person. 

813
00:31:14,773 --> 00:31:17,773
It was a surprise. I didn't know she wore it. 

814
00:31:17,773 --> 00:31:19,407
I wasn't thinking about wearing it. 

815
00:31:19,407 --> 00:31:21,507
But the men's outfit suddenly caught my eyes. 

816
00:31:21,507 --> 00:31:22,973
(Should I try it on?) 

817
00:31:23,673 --> 00:31:28,140
(She keeps adding on more items) 

818
00:31:28,773 --> 00:31:30,540
Men dress like this. 

819
00:31:30,540 --> 00:31:32,340
(Hyejin is ready) 

820
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:33,373
I'm... 

821
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:35,207
I'm all done. 

822
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:37,940
I want to try that on too. 

823
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:39,240
This isn't mother and daughter concept. 

824
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:40,940
It is a mother and daughter concept. 

825
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:43,773
- But I... / - Where did you get it from? 

826
00:31:43,773 --> 00:31:44,640
From here. 

827
00:31:46,540 --> 00:31:49,507
I've never worn anything like this before. 

828
00:31:49,507 --> 00:31:51,807
(Hyejin makes a special memory for Ina) 

829
00:31:52,140 --> 00:31:54,173
You're such an eccentric. 

830
00:31:55,807 --> 00:31:58,640
(They take a picture together) 

831
00:31:58,640 --> 00:31:59,907
My husband. 

832
00:31:59,907 --> 00:32:01,073
No! 

833
00:32:02,873 --> 00:32:04,307
- You look pretty tough. / - Doesn't she look pretty? 

834
00:32:04,307 --> 00:32:05,340
Yes, very pretty. 

835
00:32:06,307 --> 00:32:08,173
(Taking a souvenir photograph) 

836
00:32:08,173 --> 00:32:09,240
Do they take pictures for you? 

837
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:10,807
- Yes. / - They do. 

838
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:12,540
She tells you how to pose. 

839
00:32:12,540 --> 00:32:15,373
You have to pay extra for the photos. 

840
00:32:15,373 --> 00:32:16,540
(They make new memories in Hong Kong) 

841
00:32:16,540 --> 00:32:17,773
Pictures... 

842
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:19,773
They print the photos for you. 

843
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:22,407
(Photoshoot with 10 photos, $81.20) 

844
00:32:22,407 --> 00:32:23,740
$80? 

845
00:32:23,740 --> 00:32:25,340
- It includes 10 pictures. / - I see. 

846
00:32:25,340 --> 00:32:26,740
10 pictures are included. 

847
00:32:27,707 --> 00:32:30,773
(The fee includes 10 printed photos) 

848
00:32:30,773 --> 00:32:34,407
(Photoshoot with 10 photos, $81.20) 

849
00:32:34,407 --> 00:32:36,973
(I met my husband in Hong Kong) 

850
00:32:36,973 --> 00:32:38,307
- That's so nice. / - The photoshoot is worth it. 

851
00:32:38,307 --> 00:32:40,207
- She met her husband in Hong Kong. / - It's like... 

852
00:32:40,207 --> 00:32:42,040
- An old school movie. / - It's just that. 

853
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:43,940
- A movie poster. / - Yes. 

854
00:32:43,940 --> 00:32:45,507
- Very memorable. / - You can make memories... 

855
00:32:45,507 --> 00:32:48,440
- With mom. / - Wearing the qipao was great. 

856
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:51,440
Jungyu would've looked great in the men's qipao. 

857
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:54,173
- Like wearing a gown at home. / - Ina won't like that. 

858
00:32:57,073 --> 00:32:59,773
I should take a lot of photos now. 

859
00:33:00,340 --> 00:33:01,507
(Hyejin's Day for Ina) 

860
00:33:01,507 --> 00:33:04,907
(Special travel gift) 

861
00:33:04,907 --> 00:33:07,840
When you travel, it's nice to have 

862
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:10,607
something memorable or something unforgettable. 

863
00:33:10,607 --> 00:33:12,807
Wouldn't it be nice to have something like that? 

864
00:33:12,807 --> 00:33:14,373
- We can't forget about our trip. / - Right. 

865
00:33:14,373 --> 00:33:16,340
I'm sure everything about the trip is unforgettable. 

866
00:33:16,340 --> 00:33:19,407
Despite that, I want to give you a present that 

867
00:33:19,407 --> 00:33:21,273
you won't particularly forget about. 

868
00:33:21,273 --> 00:33:22,973
- What is it? / - So... 

869
00:33:22,973 --> 00:33:24,607
- Is it something tasty? / - No, no. 

870
00:33:24,607 --> 00:33:26,173
- "Something tasty?" / - So I prepared this. 

871
00:33:26,173 --> 00:33:27,507
This is it. 

872
00:33:27,507 --> 00:33:29,040
- I didn't even think about this. / - What a cute store. 

873
00:33:29,907 --> 00:33:31,540
- Perfume? / - Perfume? 

874
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:33,640
Fathers and sons won't go there. 

875
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:35,040
Since we're women. 

876
00:33:36,207 --> 00:33:37,740
What kind of fragrance do you like? 

877
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:38,807
What do you like? 

878
00:33:38,807 --> 00:33:41,607
- White musk. / - White musk. 

879
00:33:41,607 --> 00:33:43,873
- I like flowery. / - Wait, you can make your own? 

880
00:33:43,873 --> 00:33:45,373
- Yes. / - You can make hand cream? 

881
00:33:45,373 --> 00:33:47,973
You can make it with perfume. 

882
00:33:47,973 --> 00:33:49,440
- Really? / - I like doing that. 

883
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:52,073
We learned how to make that at the shop. 

884
00:33:52,073 --> 00:33:53,707
Women love that. 

885
00:33:54,507 --> 00:33:56,273
I like that. 

886
00:33:56,673 --> 00:33:59,973
Don't they just mix perfume to the hand cream? 

887
00:33:59,973 --> 00:34:01,473
No. 

888
00:34:01,473 --> 00:34:05,007
- The process itself is simple. / - In theory? 

889
00:34:05,007 --> 00:34:06,707
- But... / - Given the season... 

890
00:34:06,707 --> 00:34:09,207
- You really need hand cream now. / - Yes, you do. 

891
00:34:09,940 --> 00:34:11,307
- You try. / - Okay. 

892
00:34:13,540 --> 00:34:15,340
(She likes it) 

893
00:34:15,340 --> 00:34:16,340
Very nice. 

894
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:19,907
(Hyejin and Ina find the fragrance they each like) 

895
00:34:19,907 --> 00:34:21,240
This is good too. 

896
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:22,807
- You like? / - Yes. 

897
00:34:22,807 --> 00:34:24,707
(They will make it for each other) 

898
00:34:24,707 --> 00:34:26,040
(Hyejin's perfume is sweet, fresh and flowery) 

899
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:27,640
(Ina's perfume has a scent of magnolia flowers) 

900
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:29,373
Okay, we'll make the hand cream now. 

901
00:34:29,373 --> 00:34:30,740
- Yes. / - Okay. 

902
00:34:30,740 --> 00:34:33,140
You choose the fragrance and make the cream? 

903
00:34:33,140 --> 00:34:34,640
- Yes, that's how you make it. / - I want to visit there. 

904
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:37,407
(Camellia oil, coagulating agent, water) 

905
00:34:37,407 --> 00:34:39,607
(Perfume, empty container) 

906
00:34:39,607 --> 00:34:41,640
Alcohol pad. You should clean all of this. 

907
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:43,307
- Do you make it yourself? / - They're making it now. 

908
00:34:43,307 --> 00:34:44,140
Yes. 

909
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:47,307
This is nice. 

910
00:34:47,307 --> 00:34:49,773
Next, we'll use the big spoon. 

911
00:34:49,773 --> 00:34:52,140
Put one spoon of water inside. 

912
00:34:52,540 --> 00:34:55,140
Okay. And then use the small spoon... 

913
00:34:56,007 --> 00:34:59,440
To take the oil. Also one spoon. 

914
00:35:00,773 --> 00:35:02,040
I can't wait to see how this will turn out. 

915
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:04,107
And then, this is the coagulating agent. 

916
00:35:04,107 --> 00:35:06,707
Also one spoon. 

917
00:35:06,707 --> 00:35:07,907
Just like this? 

918
00:35:07,907 --> 00:35:09,507
- One spoon. / - One spoon? 

919
00:35:10,740 --> 00:35:11,907
- It's a coagulating agent. / - You can use... 

920
00:35:11,907 --> 00:35:13,040
The chopstick to stir. 

921
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:15,173
- Mix. / - Yes, mix it well. 

922
00:35:15,173 --> 00:35:17,073
- Are you done now? / - It's like making candles. 

923
00:35:17,673 --> 00:35:19,240
- Wow. / - The scent... 

924
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:20,807
What is that? 

925
00:35:21,340 --> 00:35:23,973
- Will it turn into cream? / - It's turning into cream. 

926
00:35:25,407 --> 00:35:27,640
- That's interesting. / - It was really quick. 

927
00:35:28,607 --> 00:35:30,873
It didn't take 5 minutes. 

928
00:35:32,073 --> 00:35:35,307
I guess this solidifies it into cream. 

929
00:35:35,907 --> 00:35:39,207
And then, you can spray the perfume inside. 

930
00:35:39,207 --> 00:35:41,373
Spray it 6 times. 

931
00:35:41,373 --> 00:35:43,007
Then you take the scent you like... 

932
00:35:43,007 --> 00:35:44,473
- And add it? / - You add it in. 

933
00:35:44,473 --> 00:35:47,007
- If you want it strong, spray more. / - That's right. 

934
00:35:47,007 --> 00:35:49,707
You can smell to see if it is okay for you. 

935
00:35:50,207 --> 00:35:52,540
If you want it to be stronger, 

936
00:35:52,540 --> 00:35:54,640
you can add one or two more times. 

937
00:35:57,473 --> 00:35:59,840
- It's weak. / - Right? 

938
00:36:00,473 --> 00:36:01,873
That's okay. 

939
00:36:01,873 --> 00:36:04,840
- I'll spray 4 more times. / - Okay. 

940
00:36:08,473 --> 00:36:10,207
- That's better? / - How is this, mom? 

941
00:36:10,773 --> 00:36:12,107
- Good. / - Okay. 

942
00:36:14,540 --> 00:36:16,407
Can you spray one more time? 

943
00:36:16,407 --> 00:36:17,407
Sure. 

944
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:25,107
(They finish making the hand cream for each other) 

945
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:27,140
When I filmed the drama with you, 

946
00:36:27,140 --> 00:36:29,007
I found out you are sensitive... 

947
00:36:29,007 --> 00:36:30,907
- To smell and you like perfume. / - Right. 

948
00:36:30,907 --> 00:36:33,540
I like perfume as well. 

949
00:36:33,540 --> 00:36:37,040
When I researched, I found this shop. 

950
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:38,807
I thought that it would be nice to come here 

951
00:36:38,807 --> 00:36:40,507
and try this together. 

952
00:36:40,507 --> 00:36:42,207
I'm really grateful for your thought. 

953
00:36:42,207 --> 00:36:44,940
You didn't stop at just realizing that I liked perfume. 

954
00:36:44,940 --> 00:36:47,607
You could have just bought me perfume as a present. 

955
00:36:47,607 --> 00:36:50,707
- Right. / - But I am grateful that I got to... 

956
00:36:50,707 --> 00:36:52,940
Experience this special activity. 

957
00:36:52,940 --> 00:36:56,473
And now, we know how to make hand cream. 

958
00:36:56,473 --> 00:36:59,007
That's right. Who knew it would be this simple? 

959
00:36:59,607 --> 00:37:02,407
It's like killing two birds with one stone. 

960
00:37:02,407 --> 00:37:05,440
(Hyejin's Day is very fruitful) 

961
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:07,373
How will you use that precious thing? 

962
00:37:07,373 --> 00:37:08,840
Exactly. 

963
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:10,740
- You have to use it quickly. / - Since we know... 

964
00:37:10,740 --> 00:37:12,340
We can make it again at home. 

965
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:14,640
Can you make it at home? 

966
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:15,673
If you have the ingredients. 

967
00:37:15,673 --> 00:37:17,073
Anyone can make the hand cream 

968
00:37:17,073 --> 00:37:18,873
with the perfume you like. 

969
00:37:18,873 --> 00:37:20,940
I want to try that. 

970
00:37:21,673 --> 00:37:25,507
I asked my Chinese friend about this restaurant. 

971
00:37:25,507 --> 00:37:27,640
I heard that it is a very famous restaurant. 

972
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:29,540
- It's a "huo guo" place. / - Huo guo? 

973
00:37:29,540 --> 00:37:30,807
I love huo guo. 

974
00:37:31,773 --> 00:37:33,440
This is the place. 

975
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:35,673
- It's called hot pot in English. / - Right. 

976
00:37:36,407 --> 00:37:39,007
- I've been to this place. / - Was the food good? 

977
00:37:39,007 --> 00:37:40,840
It was good. It's really delicious. 

978
00:37:41,507 --> 00:37:43,173
I like it too. I really like hot pot. 

979
00:37:43,173 --> 00:37:45,807
They serve very fresh seafood. 

980
00:37:46,607 --> 00:37:47,607
Meat too. 

981
00:37:47,607 --> 00:37:49,773
- A local recommended this place? / - A local did. 

982
00:37:49,773 --> 00:37:51,673
That's why we have to make a reservation. 

983
00:37:52,140 --> 00:37:53,640
- We have to make a reservation? / - Is this... 

984
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:55,773
- Shim Hyejin's regular place? / - Yes. 

985
00:37:56,807 --> 00:37:58,040
I bet it's delicious. 

986
00:37:58,040 --> 00:37:59,707
Try that restaurant when you're in Hong Kong. 

987
00:37:59,707 --> 00:38:01,873
- It's really good. / - Do you want their business card? 

988
00:38:01,873 --> 00:38:03,040
That's alright. 

989
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:04,640
I'll be able to find it online. 

990
00:38:05,740 --> 00:38:09,373
(This is the dinner Hyejin prepared for Ina) 

991
00:38:13,807 --> 00:38:21,101
(Battle Trip Part 2 will be aired soon) 

992
00:38:21,987 --> 00:38:23,754
It looks so delicious. 

993
00:38:25,254 --> 00:38:27,254
It looks delicious. 

994
00:38:27,254 --> 00:38:28,287
It's seafood. 

995
00:38:28,287 --> 00:38:29,654
- It was really delicious. / - It looks so fresh. 

996
00:38:29,654 --> 00:38:32,654
- It's shrimp ball. / - I've never had seafood in hot pot. 

997
00:38:32,654 --> 00:38:33,654
Isn't that an oyster? 

998
00:38:33,654 --> 00:38:35,220
- They put oysters in it. / - Why is the oyster so big? 

999
00:38:35,220 --> 00:38:36,220
- It looks delicious. / - Hot pot. 

1000
00:38:36,220 --> 00:38:38,720
This is the real health food, isn't it? 

1001
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:41,354
If you haven't tried goat breast, don't say anything. 

1002
00:38:41,354 --> 00:38:44,320
Oyster is a great health food. 

1003
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:46,054
- He's so funny. / - I think it's very unique... 

1004
00:38:46,054 --> 00:38:47,287
- That you add seafood. / - Isn't it beautiful? 

1005
00:38:47,287 --> 00:38:50,187
Hong Kong is famous for good seafood. 

1006
00:38:50,187 --> 00:38:51,120
(Hyejin's Day for Ina) 

1007
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:54,554
(Hot pot) 

1008
00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:11,754
(The night falls on the first day) 

1009
00:39:13,954 --> 00:39:16,354
We're going to a hot pot restaurant. 

1010
00:39:16,354 --> 00:39:18,987
- We've been in the city center... / - Hot pot! 

1011
00:39:18,987 --> 00:39:21,154
The whole day today. 

1012
00:39:21,154 --> 00:39:23,887
There's a bad traffic jam 

1013
00:39:23,887 --> 00:39:26,220
at this time of day. 

1014
00:39:26,220 --> 00:39:26,587
Right. 

1015
00:39:26,587 --> 00:39:29,487
All the people in these buildings have to go home. 

1016
00:39:30,054 --> 00:39:33,254
So we're going to take a ferry. 

1017
00:39:33,254 --> 00:39:35,420
There's a ferry that goes around the city. 

1018
00:39:35,420 --> 00:39:37,920
If we ride the ferry, it takes 10 minutes 

1019
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:39,787
to get to where we want to go. 

1020
00:39:39,787 --> 00:39:42,487
We can save a lot of time. 

1021
00:39:43,087 --> 00:39:44,220
- She's right. / - It's so fast. 

1022
00:39:44,220 --> 00:39:45,320
It's like a water taxi. 

1023
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:47,020
- There are water taxis? / - Yes. 

1024
00:39:47,020 --> 00:39:48,820
If you take a taxi, you have to take a detour. 

1025
00:39:48,820 --> 00:39:51,087
- But the ferry can go straight. / - That's right. 

1026
00:39:51,087 --> 00:39:53,487
(10 minutes from Central to Tsim Sha Tsui, 32 cents) 

1027
00:39:53,487 --> 00:39:54,754
This is interesting. 

1028
00:39:54,754 --> 00:39:56,754
- 30 cents? / - It's so cheap. 

1029
00:39:56,754 --> 00:39:57,854
It's really cheap. 

1030
00:39:57,854 --> 00:39:58,854
Why is it so cheap? 

1031
00:39:58,854 --> 00:40:01,087
You can sit or stand on the ferry. 

1032
00:40:01,087 --> 00:40:04,920
It takes only 10 minutes, so take it easy. 

1033
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:07,320
You can see the night view on the ferry too. How nice. 

1034
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:08,454
It's really nice. 

1035
00:40:08,454 --> 00:40:09,954
(Hyejin likes taking videos with her GoPro) 

1036
00:40:11,254 --> 00:40:12,254
We're here. 

1037
00:40:12,854 --> 00:40:13,887
I'm excited. 

1038
00:40:14,954 --> 00:40:16,287
It's here. 

1039
00:40:16,287 --> 00:40:17,620
It smells like the sea here, doesn't it? 

1040
00:40:17,620 --> 00:40:20,454
(Everything is fascinating and exciting for Ina) 

1041
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:22,854
Here we go. 

1042
00:40:24,654 --> 00:40:27,687
- She's so cute. / - We're taking off. 

1043
00:40:27,687 --> 00:40:29,720
Here we go. 

1044
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:32,820
(Let's go have dinner) 

1045
00:40:32,820 --> 00:40:35,654
I think this is one of the best things in Hong Kong. 

1046
00:40:35,654 --> 00:40:37,654
- The ferry ride at night. / - It looks nice indeed. 

1047
00:40:37,654 --> 00:40:39,854
You don't need a 6-hour cruise. 

1048
00:40:40,420 --> 00:40:41,654
You can feel the refreshing wind. 

1049
00:40:42,187 --> 00:40:43,187
- That's nice. / - Wow. 

1050
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:44,920
I have to show this to the viewers. 

1051
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:50,487
(You can enjoy the night view while being on the move) 

1052
00:40:50,487 --> 00:40:52,320
This is so beautiful. 

1053
00:40:58,754 --> 00:41:01,087
On the ferry, you can see everything. 

1054
00:41:01,087 --> 00:41:02,887
You have a full 360-degree view. 

1055
00:41:02,887 --> 00:41:05,120
- It's nice. / - How do you like it? 

1056
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:07,254
I'm so happy. This is amazing. 

1057
00:41:07,254 --> 00:41:09,554
You look like the lady from the sea. 

1058
00:41:09,554 --> 00:41:10,987
- Like a mermaid. / - The lady from the sea? 

1059
00:41:10,987 --> 00:41:13,254
If you reveal your top half, you'd look like a mermaid. 

1060
00:41:15,654 --> 00:41:16,687
A mermaid princess. 

1061
00:41:16,687 --> 00:41:18,287
That looks cool, Ina. 

1062
00:41:19,054 --> 00:41:20,454
Do I look good with my hair flying in the wind? 

1063
00:41:20,454 --> 00:41:22,254
That must be Ina's first time. 

1064
00:41:22,254 --> 00:41:23,487
- Right. / - She must've been so excited. 

1065
00:41:23,487 --> 00:41:25,020
It feels so good to be on a ferry for the first time. 

1066
00:41:25,020 --> 00:41:26,220
It feels amazing. 

1067
00:41:26,754 --> 00:41:29,487
- It really feels like you're in Hong Kong. / - Right. 

1068
00:41:29,487 --> 00:41:31,454
I've never watched the night view that way. 

1069
00:41:31,454 --> 00:41:33,087
- This is amazing. / - And it costs... 

1070
00:41:33,087 --> 00:41:35,520
It's only 30 cents, so you should ride it. 

1071
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:38,054
It is even more beautiful when you see it on a ferry. 

1072
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:46,787
(After enjoying the night view, the ferry ride is over) 

1073
00:41:46,787 --> 00:41:50,254
We're here. We will get off the ferry 

1074
00:41:50,254 --> 00:41:52,154
and take a taxi. 

1075
00:41:52,154 --> 00:41:53,887
That's too bad. I wish we could get there on a ferry. 

1076
00:41:58,320 --> 00:42:01,687
(16 minutes from Tsim Sha Tsui to the hot pot place) 

1077
00:42:01,687 --> 00:42:03,887
I want to go to that hot pot place again. 

1078
00:42:04,554 --> 00:42:06,454
- I'm so jealous. / - What would it taste like? 

1079
00:42:06,454 --> 00:42:08,454
Now I can see the place. 

1080
00:42:08,454 --> 00:42:10,654
I wanted to feed you something nice... 

1081
00:42:10,654 --> 00:42:12,754
- So I picked this place. / - I'm so touched. 

1082
00:42:12,754 --> 00:42:15,087
You're touched? Enjoy it. 

1083
00:42:15,087 --> 00:42:16,187
Okay. I'll eat a lot. 

1084
00:42:16,187 --> 00:42:18,354
- I'm so hungry now. / - Okay. 

1085
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:20,687
Zhang Ziyi's favorite hot pot place. 

1086
00:42:20,687 --> 00:42:22,854
There are places like that in Hong Kong. 

1087
00:42:22,854 --> 00:42:25,154
A lot of celebrities of Hong Kong visit this place. 

1088
00:42:25,154 --> 00:42:26,320
This place? 

1089
00:42:27,587 --> 00:42:30,187
I tried hot pot for the first time in Guangzhou. 

1090
00:42:30,187 --> 00:42:33,087
So this is my second time. 

1091
00:42:33,087 --> 00:42:34,520
It has two different kinds of broth, 

1092
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:36,320
and one of them is spicy. 

1093
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:38,787
Was that the whole pepper? What is it called? 

1094
00:42:38,787 --> 00:42:40,654
- It's mala. / - Mala? 

1095
00:42:40,654 --> 00:42:41,854
After I had the soup... 

1096
00:42:41,854 --> 00:42:45,554
(As she tasted the soup, her mouth was on fire) 

1097
00:42:45,554 --> 00:42:46,820
It felt like this. 

1098
00:42:46,820 --> 00:42:48,820
- It's strong, right? / - It's very strong. 

1099
00:42:48,820 --> 00:42:50,320
It felt as though my mouth was numbed. 

1100
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:52,287
- Mala is... / - This wouldn't taste like that. 

1101
00:42:52,287 --> 00:42:54,120
- It's not that strong there. / - Why? 

1102
00:42:54,120 --> 00:42:56,354
When I tried it here, 

1103
00:42:56,354 --> 00:42:58,454
it didn't taste like that. 

1104
00:42:58,454 --> 00:42:59,787
It's not so strong there. 

1105
00:42:59,787 --> 00:43:01,854
- We've been to Sichuan before. / - Right. 

1106
00:43:01,854 --> 00:43:04,120
This is different from the hot pot of Sichuan. 

1107
00:43:04,120 --> 00:43:05,820
- This one is a lot milder. / - Peanut sauce. 

1108
00:43:05,820 --> 00:43:09,720
(The scent and spiciness is milder in Hong Kong) 

1109
00:43:11,054 --> 00:43:13,754
Thank you. 

1110
00:43:13,954 --> 00:43:15,554
This is peanut sauce. 

1111
00:43:15,554 --> 00:43:16,754
That's peanut sauce. 

1112
00:43:16,754 --> 00:43:17,987
- I see. / - Wow. 

1113
00:43:17,987 --> 00:43:19,920
- The peanut sauce is not greasy. / - And chili oil. 

1114
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:21,020
It's really good. 

1115
00:43:21,020 --> 00:43:24,687
And add chili oil in soy sauce. 

1116
00:43:25,387 --> 00:43:27,054
- Look at that chili oil. / - Add it all. 

1117
00:43:27,054 --> 00:43:28,520
- And coriander. / - You like coriander now. 

1118
00:43:28,520 --> 00:43:30,287
- Of course. / - Even on pad thai. 

1119
00:43:30,287 --> 00:43:32,287
- I'm not a big fan. / - I didn't add it. 

1120
00:43:33,320 --> 00:43:35,987
Use it as a dip. 

1121
00:43:35,987 --> 00:43:37,120
(The hot pot sauce is ready) 

1122
00:43:37,120 --> 00:43:38,387
I can't wait. 

1123
00:43:38,387 --> 00:43:40,254
(She feels bored waiting for the food) 

1124
00:43:40,587 --> 00:43:42,154
Do you want to watch TV? 

1125
00:43:42,154 --> 00:43:43,587
We have to pay to watch TV. 

1126
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:48,220
(She laughs in amazement) 

1127
00:43:48,220 --> 00:43:49,687
I don't know what it says, 

1128
00:43:49,687 --> 00:43:51,320
but I see dollar signs. 

1129
00:43:51,320 --> 00:43:52,887
(She can't read it but she sounds confident) 

1130
00:43:54,154 --> 00:43:55,120
It's about corkage charge. 

1131
00:43:55,120 --> 00:43:57,054
It was about bringing your own alcohol. 

1132
00:43:57,054 --> 00:43:59,720
Having to pay to watch TV... 

1133
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:02,087
I just believed what she said but... 

1134
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:04,787
I laughed because I couldn't believe it. 

1135
00:44:04,787 --> 00:44:07,187
Gosh, how could you say such a thing? 

1136
00:44:07,187 --> 00:44:08,187
(Cute) 

1137
00:44:08,187 --> 00:44:10,220
It's finally here. 

1138
00:44:10,220 --> 00:44:13,120
(The hot pot is served while they laugh and chat) 

1139
00:44:16,054 --> 00:44:17,254
Why is she surprised? 

1140
00:44:17,254 --> 00:44:19,354
- What? / - It was too big. 

1141
00:44:19,354 --> 00:44:20,620
Is it for two people? 

1142
00:44:20,620 --> 00:44:23,287
We just picked what we wanted to eat on the menu. 

1143
00:44:23,287 --> 00:44:25,787
They thought it'd come out in small servings. 

1144
00:44:26,220 --> 00:44:28,920
I think we ordered too much. 

1145
00:44:29,587 --> 00:44:31,920
(Shocked) 

1146
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:33,720
Thank you. 

1147
00:44:34,020 --> 00:44:36,020
- Oh, my God. / - You can eat it all. 

1148
00:44:36,687 --> 00:44:37,954
Sandeul, you can eat it all by yourself, right? 

1149
00:44:37,954 --> 00:44:40,087
- Look at that. / - I can eat it alone. 

1150
00:44:40,087 --> 00:44:41,654
- Look at the shrimp. It moved. / - It's alive. 

1151
00:44:41,654 --> 00:44:42,954
I can eat it all by myself. 

1152
00:44:42,954 --> 00:44:44,520
It will shrink in the soup. 

1153
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:46,320
It may seem big 

1154
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:48,654
but we have only three oysters. 

1155
00:44:48,654 --> 00:44:51,020
I've never seen such big oysters before. 

1156
00:44:52,187 --> 00:44:54,787
Put the oysters in it when they're fresh. 

1157
00:44:54,787 --> 00:44:55,987
We also have meat. 

1158
00:44:55,987 --> 00:44:57,054
I want meat. 

1159
00:44:57,054 --> 00:44:59,587
(They put in the ingredients they want) 

1160
00:45:00,220 --> 00:45:02,687
We don't do that with fish a lot. 

1161
00:45:02,687 --> 00:45:04,420
- That's right. / - I like that they have it. 

1162
00:45:04,420 --> 00:45:08,287
It tastes so good with fresh fish. 

1163
00:45:08,287 --> 00:45:09,820
Isn't it fishy? 

1164
00:45:09,820 --> 00:45:11,287
- It's very sweet. / - Really? 

1165
00:45:11,287 --> 00:45:13,020
- Because it's fresh. / - It must be really good. 

1166
00:45:13,020 --> 00:45:14,620
- I haven't tried this before. / - You can eat it raw. 

1167
00:45:14,620 --> 00:45:17,187
Let's eat the vegetables first. 

1168
00:45:17,187 --> 00:45:18,754
I'm going to dip it in here. 

1169
00:45:18,754 --> 00:45:20,787
(She eats it with the sauce) 

1170
00:45:21,654 --> 00:45:22,787
Vegetables? 

1171
00:45:23,587 --> 00:45:24,920
- Is it good? / - Yes. 

1172
00:45:26,454 --> 00:45:27,887
(Ina tastes it too) 

1173
00:45:27,887 --> 00:45:29,287
It tastes like... 

1174
00:45:30,887 --> 00:45:32,020
Isn't it great? 

1175
00:45:32,020 --> 00:45:33,554
(Clapping like a seal) 

1176
00:45:33,554 --> 00:45:35,154
It tastes amazing. 

1177
00:45:35,154 --> 00:45:36,387
It's really spicy. 

1178
00:45:37,287 --> 00:45:38,387
Which one? 

1179
00:45:38,387 --> 00:45:39,487
- This one. / - That one? 

1180
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:41,487
It's really spicy. You should be careful. 

1181
00:45:41,487 --> 00:45:42,820
(Extremely spicy) 

1182
00:45:42,820 --> 00:45:45,187
It makes me eat vegetables. 

1183
00:45:45,187 --> 00:45:47,654
- This is really great. / - It's so delicious. 

1184
00:45:47,654 --> 00:45:48,987
Let's try the oysters. 

1185
00:45:51,420 --> 00:45:52,954
It looks great. Is it an oyster? 

1186
00:45:52,954 --> 00:45:54,187
- Is it an oyster? / - I think it is. 

1187
00:45:54,187 --> 00:45:55,687
- It is an oyster. / - My gosh. 

1188
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:57,654
It looks bigger when it's cooked. 

1189
00:45:57,654 --> 00:45:59,220
It doesn't fit in your mouth. 

1190
00:45:59,220 --> 00:46:00,954
You can't eat it in one bite. 

1191
00:46:01,587 --> 00:46:03,454
Oysters are very good for your health. 

1192
00:46:03,454 --> 00:46:05,454
How is it so big? Is it farmed? 

1193
00:46:06,020 --> 00:46:07,354
It's huge. 

1194
00:46:07,354 --> 00:46:08,887
(Ina tastes it heartily) 

1195
00:46:08,887 --> 00:46:11,154
- Eating one will make you full. / - It's hot. 

1196
00:46:13,120 --> 00:46:14,787
It must have a chewy texture. 

1197
00:46:14,787 --> 00:46:16,720
- It must be good. / - It was very chewy. 

1198
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:17,954
Gosh, it looks so good. 

1199
00:46:17,954 --> 00:46:19,454
- It is sweet. / - It's so chewy. 

1200
00:46:19,887 --> 00:46:22,054
- It's tender and... / - Chewy? 

1201
00:46:22,754 --> 00:46:26,287
It tastes like milk. 

1202
00:46:26,287 --> 00:46:27,454
You're right. 

1203
00:46:27,454 --> 00:46:31,020
It's perfect with the sauce. 

1204
00:46:31,854 --> 00:46:32,987
I'm not a fan of oysters... 

1205
00:46:32,987 --> 00:46:34,987
- But this is really good. / - Wow. 

1206
00:46:34,987 --> 00:46:36,054
That's our soy sauce. 

1207
00:46:36,054 --> 00:46:37,387
It's so hard to watch right now. 

1208
00:46:37,387 --> 00:46:41,220
You can put fish balls or dumplings in it. 

1209
00:46:41,220 --> 00:46:43,820
- Really? / - Let's try this. 

1210
00:46:43,820 --> 00:46:46,387
- The shrimp balls. / - It must be good. 

1211
00:46:46,387 --> 00:46:48,054
It tastes so good. 

1212
00:46:48,054 --> 00:46:48,754
You have to eat it. 

1213
00:46:48,754 --> 00:46:51,154
- The shrimp balls. / - It looks amazing. 

1214
00:46:51,154 --> 00:46:52,354
This is so good. 

1215
00:46:52,354 --> 00:46:53,820
- My goodness. / - It's shrimp. 

1216
00:46:53,820 --> 00:46:55,554
It makes me hungry. 

1217
00:46:55,554 --> 00:46:57,454
I'm going to eat meat first. 

1218
00:46:57,454 --> 00:47:00,120
(Hyejin loves the shrimp balls) 

1219
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:03,820
The shrimp is alive. 

1220
00:47:04,754 --> 00:47:07,054
It can't be alive. This is serious. 

1221
00:47:07,054 --> 00:47:09,120
That's not what I mean. 

1222
00:47:09,120 --> 00:47:11,787
(It has the bouncy texture of shrimp) 

1223
00:47:11,787 --> 00:47:13,154
It has a whole shrimp in it. 

1224
00:47:13,154 --> 00:47:15,620
- It has the whole shrimp in it. / - Great texture. 

1225
00:47:15,620 --> 00:47:17,420
- The texture is good. / - It's a dumpling. 

1226
00:47:17,420 --> 00:47:20,387
- Right. It's really good. / - It's so firm. 

1227
00:47:20,387 --> 00:47:21,554
Try this. 

1228
00:47:21,554 --> 00:47:23,054
(She gives the shrimp ball to Ina) 

1229
00:47:23,054 --> 00:47:24,554
It's really good. 

1230
00:47:24,554 --> 00:47:28,520
(What does the shrimp ball taste like?) 

1231
00:47:30,954 --> 00:47:32,120
Mamma Mia. 

1232
00:47:33,454 --> 00:47:34,620
It's alive. 

1233
00:47:34,620 --> 00:47:36,120
I know what you mean now. 

1234
00:47:36,120 --> 00:47:38,087
(Happy) 

1235
00:47:38,087 --> 00:47:39,820
I'll have some meat now. 

1236
00:47:40,520 --> 00:47:42,987
(The meat is covered with the red soup) 

1237
00:47:42,987 --> 00:47:44,187
It looks good. 

1238
00:47:45,587 --> 00:47:47,220
- My gosh. / - It looks delicious. 

1239
00:47:47,620 --> 00:47:49,987
It will taste good with goat meat. 

1240
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:55,287
- You liked the goat breast. / - Goat breast. 

1241
00:47:57,587 --> 00:48:00,354
(She takes a big bite of meat) 

1242
00:48:03,720 --> 00:48:05,054
Meat is the best. 

1243
00:48:06,187 --> 00:48:07,420
It's so savory. 

1244
00:48:07,420 --> 00:48:08,854
- It's good, right? / - Yes. 

1245
00:48:08,854 --> 00:48:11,220
I just can't watch this. 

1246
00:48:11,220 --> 00:48:13,854
I had the meat in the red soup 

1247
00:48:13,854 --> 00:48:15,820
with the peanut sauce. 

1248
00:48:15,820 --> 00:48:17,987
It's savory and not greasy at all. 

1249
00:48:18,454 --> 00:48:20,487
It's not too spicy. 

1250
00:48:20,487 --> 00:48:21,554
The important thing is 

1251
00:48:21,554 --> 00:48:23,620
that the peanut sauce is not sweet. 

1252
00:48:23,620 --> 00:48:25,320
It tastes just like peanuts. 

1253
00:48:25,320 --> 00:48:26,654
So it tastes light. 

1254
00:48:27,754 --> 00:48:29,420
(Ina tastes it after Hyejin) 

1255
00:48:29,420 --> 00:48:30,720
You can try them one by one. 

1256
00:48:32,820 --> 00:48:36,520
(Amazed) 

1257
00:48:39,087 --> 00:48:40,320
- What do I do? / - Why? 

1258
00:48:40,820 --> 00:48:42,920
I should open a franchiser in Korea. 

1259
00:48:43,420 --> 00:48:45,087
- This is so good. / - Sandeul's been won over. 

1260
00:48:45,554 --> 00:48:47,387
They've won him over. Are you okay? 

1261
00:48:47,387 --> 00:48:50,120
No. He's not watching it. He closed his eyes. 

1262
00:48:50,120 --> 00:48:51,854
He's training his mind. 

1263
00:48:51,854 --> 00:48:53,320
You caved in to the meat. 

1264
00:48:54,287 --> 00:48:55,520
She's proud. 

1265
00:48:56,020 --> 00:48:57,054
Hyejin looks proud. 

1266
00:48:57,054 --> 00:48:59,020
- Because she liked the food. / - I understand. 

1267
00:48:59,020 --> 00:48:59,920
We ate almost everything. 

1268
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:01,587
Why are you eating for so long? 

1269
00:49:01,587 --> 00:49:03,787
It looks even better because it's winter. 

1270
00:49:03,787 --> 00:49:05,687
- We ordered too much. / - Right. 

1271
00:49:05,687 --> 00:49:06,820
(Meat cooked in white broth then into the sauce) 

1272
00:49:08,354 --> 00:49:11,187
(Straight to her mouth) 

1273
00:49:14,787 --> 00:49:15,987
Is it good? 

1274
00:49:17,587 --> 00:49:18,754
This is better. 

1275
00:49:18,754 --> 00:49:19,587
(Meat cooked in the white soup is the way to go) 

1276
00:49:20,220 --> 00:49:22,654
(Ina tries it the way Hyejin ate) 

1277
00:49:22,654 --> 00:49:23,887
(She likes the smell) 

1278
00:49:29,020 --> 00:49:30,087
What do you think? 

1279
00:49:30,920 --> 00:49:32,720
I can see why you like this better. 

1280
00:49:33,954 --> 00:49:36,087
This one tastes light. 

1281
00:49:36,087 --> 00:49:39,487
I can appreciate the taste of the ingredients. 

1282
00:49:39,487 --> 00:49:42,020
Each ingredient has its own taste. I like that. 

1283
00:49:42,020 --> 00:49:43,154
I guess we can say this. 

1284
00:49:43,154 --> 00:49:44,920
This one is like spicy beef soup 

1285
00:49:44,920 --> 00:49:46,287
and this one is like ox bone soup. 

1286
00:49:46,287 --> 00:49:49,354
Those who like spicy food will love the red soup. 

1287
00:49:49,354 --> 00:49:50,420
You're right. 

1288
00:49:50,420 --> 00:49:52,020
(If you like spicy food, try the red soup) 

1289
00:49:53,420 --> 00:49:56,054
If you like something light and clean, 

1290
00:49:56,054 --> 00:49:58,220
try the white soup, the vegetable broth. 

1291
00:49:58,220 --> 00:49:59,820
(If you like light and clean taste, try the white soup) 

1292
00:49:59,820 --> 00:50:01,487
I want to eat noodles with it. 

1293
00:50:01,487 --> 00:50:03,687
You should add Chinese style glass noodles. 

1294
00:50:03,687 --> 00:50:04,887
It's really good. 

1295
00:50:04,887 --> 00:50:06,620
This is so... 

1296
00:50:06,620 --> 00:50:08,187
I really like this. 

1297
00:50:08,187 --> 00:50:10,220
I love meat in the soup. 

1298
00:50:11,387 --> 00:50:12,587
So it's all about meat. 

1299
00:50:12,587 --> 00:50:13,587
Meat is the right answer. 

1300
00:50:14,654 --> 00:50:17,654
(Ina's love for meat is unstoppable) 

1301
00:50:17,887 --> 00:50:22,420
(They start to eat up) 

1302
00:50:24,520 --> 00:50:28,720
(They look like loving mother and daughter) 

1303
00:50:32,387 --> 00:50:34,220
(Happy) 

1304
00:50:34,820 --> 00:50:36,487
I want to eat more... 

1305
00:50:37,420 --> 00:50:38,587
But I should stop. 

1306
00:50:38,587 --> 00:50:40,387
Mom, you can't give up. 

1307
00:50:40,387 --> 00:50:41,754
I'm sorry. 

1308
00:50:41,754 --> 00:50:43,354
I'm on a diet actually. 

1309
00:50:43,354 --> 00:50:44,754
I said that after eating so much. 

1310
00:50:44,754 --> 00:50:45,620
Now you say that? 

1311
00:50:45,620 --> 00:50:47,954
- After eating so much? / - I know. 

1312
00:50:47,954 --> 00:50:49,720
It's okay. It's all protein. 

1313
00:50:49,720 --> 00:50:51,720
The hot pot will be sad. 

1314
00:50:51,720 --> 00:50:53,654
I'm sorry about that. 

1315
00:50:53,654 --> 00:50:56,654
So I shouldn't betray it. I'll keep at it. 

1316
00:51:00,554 --> 00:51:02,887
(The dinner that threatens their diet is over) 

1317
00:51:02,887 --> 00:51:04,120
Did you enjoy it? 

1318
00:51:04,120 --> 00:51:05,854
- It was the best. / - Was it? 

1319
00:51:06,887 --> 00:51:09,687
Today is the first day and tomorrow is your day, right? 

1320
00:51:09,687 --> 00:51:11,020
Yes, I'm nervous. 

1321
00:51:11,020 --> 00:51:13,420
You will also prepare everything for me tomorrow. 

1322
00:51:13,420 --> 00:51:15,187
I'll make you feel moved, 

1323
00:51:15,187 --> 00:51:16,387
as much as I was moved today. 

1324
00:51:16,387 --> 00:51:19,520
Think of this as a meal for tomorrow's trekking. 

1325
00:51:19,854 --> 00:51:22,987
Should we end here today? 

1326
00:51:23,620 --> 00:51:25,654
- Thank you, mom. / - I enjoyed the food. 

1327
00:51:25,654 --> 00:51:26,987
Saved as a good restaurant. 

1328
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:31,187
(Mamma Mia Tour's day draws to an end) 

1329
00:51:31,620 --> 00:51:34,854
I heard that there was a trekking course. 

1330
00:51:34,854 --> 00:51:38,120
I thought it'd be a good idea to do it together. 

1331
00:51:38,120 --> 00:51:39,520
Since the weather is nice. 

1332
00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:41,954
- I'd like that. / - They said it's nice these days. 

1333
00:51:42,187 --> 00:51:43,454
For the second day, 

1334
00:51:43,454 --> 00:51:46,887
I'll prepare everything in regards with the trekking. 

1335
00:51:46,887 --> 00:51:48,287
Okay. 

1336
00:51:48,287 --> 00:51:50,054
If you're tired of obvious Hong Kong trips, 

1337
00:51:50,054 --> 00:51:51,787
we recommend trekking. 

1338
00:51:53,654 --> 00:51:56,787
It's called the Dragon's Back. 

1339
00:51:58,120 --> 00:51:59,987
(She searches in detail) 

1340
00:51:59,987 --> 00:52:01,854
- 8.5km? / - 8.5km. 

1341
00:52:01,854 --> 00:52:03,420
It's a piece of cake. 

1342
00:52:04,787 --> 00:52:07,787
(Shopping and night view comes to mind) 

1343
00:52:07,787 --> 00:52:10,587
(When you think of Hong Kong) 

1344
00:52:11,054 --> 00:52:13,320
(No more showy concrete jungles) 

1345
00:52:14,920 --> 00:52:16,854
Was this chosen as the best trekking course in Asia? 

1346
00:52:16,854 --> 00:52:19,187
- Yes. / - CNN chose this place as... 

1347
00:52:19,187 --> 00:52:21,354
- The best trekking course in Asia. / - The best. 

1348
00:52:21,354 --> 00:52:22,354
That's amazing. 

1349
00:52:22,354 --> 00:52:25,387
- The view is amazing. / - In 2004, CNN chose it... 

1350
00:52:25,387 --> 00:52:29,154
As the best trekking course in Asia. 

1351
00:52:29,154 --> 00:52:33,087
- The best trekking course in Asia? / - The best. 

1352
00:52:33,087 --> 00:52:34,820
(The course isn't difficult and the view is magnificent) 

1353
00:52:34,820 --> 00:52:37,754
This course isn't that difficult. 

1354
00:52:37,754 --> 00:52:39,820
- Even beginners can go here. / - Yes. 

1355
00:52:39,820 --> 00:52:40,987
It's easy to hike. 

1356
00:52:40,987 --> 00:52:43,187
It's impossible for Ssangdeulier Tour. 

1357
00:52:43,820 --> 00:52:45,520
- They don't like to be tired. / - That's right. 

1358
00:52:45,520 --> 00:52:46,587
If we hike for 15 minutes, 

1359
00:52:46,587 --> 00:52:48,554
we will have to sleep for a little. 

1360
00:52:49,787 --> 00:52:54,520
(Ina's Day for Hyejin) 

1361
00:52:55,720 --> 00:53:00,354
(The brilliant stars disappeared) 

1362
00:53:01,454 --> 00:53:05,087
(And their Hong Kong trip starts again) 

1363
00:53:06,820 --> 00:53:08,454
They must be doing morning exercises. 

1364
00:53:09,687 --> 00:53:12,620
- They do morning exercises. / - That's right. 

1365
00:53:12,620 --> 00:53:15,387
- The Chinese do that... / - It's so interesting. 

1366
00:53:15,387 --> 00:53:18,220
- In the morning. / - You see this on the news. 

1367
00:53:18,220 --> 00:53:19,854
They're also doing it in Hong Kong. 

1368
00:53:19,854 --> 00:53:21,387
I also need to work out. 

1369
00:53:22,687 --> 00:53:24,020
- Mom. / - Yes? 

1370
00:53:24,020 --> 00:53:26,087
- Are you ready? / - Should we also do that? 

1371
00:53:26,087 --> 00:53:28,087
We have to go trekking, not exercise. 

1372
00:53:28,087 --> 00:53:30,054
We have to go trekking today. 

1373
00:53:30,054 --> 00:53:32,320
Before we go trekking, which you wanted to do, 

1374
00:53:32,320 --> 00:53:33,387
we're going to eat dim sum. 

1375
00:53:33,387 --> 00:53:36,020
It's not ordinary dim sum that everyone eats. 

1376
00:53:36,020 --> 00:53:37,887
I prepared a special dim sum. 

1377
00:53:37,887 --> 00:53:38,787
A special dim sum? 

1378
00:53:38,787 --> 00:53:40,354
We will look forward to what it will be like. 

1379
00:53:40,354 --> 00:53:42,587
They must have made dim sum into shapes, right? 

1380
00:53:43,487 --> 00:53:45,254
You shouldn't get it right so quickly. 

1381
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:48,287
(It's not a difficult guess for the master of traveling) 

1382
00:53:48,287 --> 00:53:49,887
- What is that? / - It's so cute. 

1383
00:53:49,887 --> 00:53:51,954
It's a place where you can take a lot of photos 

1384
00:53:51,954 --> 00:53:53,787
for your social media. 

1385
00:53:54,287 --> 00:53:55,354
Are you going there right now? 

1386
00:53:55,354 --> 00:53:56,120
Yes. 

1387
00:53:56,120 --> 00:53:57,720
You've never seen a dim sum like that, right? 

1388
00:53:57,720 --> 00:53:59,420
I heard that there are more than 

1389
00:53:59,420 --> 00:54:00,887
100 kinds of dim sum in Hong Kong. 

1390
00:54:00,887 --> 00:54:01,754
There are far more than 100 kinds. 

1391
00:54:01,754 --> 00:54:03,420
- Right? / - There are so many. 

1392
00:54:03,420 --> 00:54:04,420
You couldn't count. 

1393
00:54:04,420 --> 00:54:05,987
I guarantee the taste. 

1394
00:54:05,987 --> 00:54:08,454
If you can't guarantee how good it is, 

1395
00:54:08,454 --> 00:54:09,754
I might criticize you. 

1396
00:54:09,754 --> 00:54:11,687
I looked it up online and it looked nice... 

1397
00:54:11,687 --> 00:54:14,854
They say that what looks good tastes good... 

1398
00:54:14,854 --> 00:54:17,620
But I'm not sure about that. 

1399
00:54:18,054 --> 00:54:19,720
(She's completely exhausted) 

1400
00:54:20,454 --> 00:54:21,954
(Around the time Ina was on edge) 

1401
00:54:21,954 --> 00:54:23,220
- Mom! / - Why? 

1402
00:54:23,220 --> 00:54:24,920
Can you see that shining place? 

1403
00:54:24,920 --> 00:54:26,454
- Is it that place? / - Yes. 

1404
00:54:26,454 --> 00:54:28,020
I saw that place from photos. 

1405
00:54:28,854 --> 00:54:30,554
- Here? / - That's right. 

1406
00:54:31,154 --> 00:54:32,554
- Is it right? / - Yes. 

1407
00:54:33,087 --> 00:54:35,120
There are so many pretty buildings 

1408
00:54:35,120 --> 00:54:36,320
hidden among large buildings. 

1409
00:54:36,320 --> 00:54:38,054
It was hard to find. 

1410
00:54:38,054 --> 00:54:41,954
I heard that most Hong Kong people really eat 

1411
00:54:41,954 --> 00:54:44,654
dim sum during lunch as the main dish. 

1412
00:54:45,854 --> 00:54:47,720
You said you were on a diet. 

1413
00:54:49,887 --> 00:54:51,387
- It smells sweet. / - Dim sum is good for diet. 

1414
00:54:51,387 --> 00:54:52,954
It was also my first time eating dim sum. 

1415
00:54:52,954 --> 00:54:54,320
- What? / - Really? 

1416
00:54:54,320 --> 00:54:56,387
- What? / - I also only had it once. 

1417
00:54:56,387 --> 00:54:57,520
It was my first time there. 

1418
00:54:57,520 --> 00:54:58,820
This is a problem. 

1419
00:54:58,820 --> 00:55:00,854
You can't eat dim sum elsewhere now. 

1420
00:55:00,854 --> 00:55:02,354
- You're in trouble. / - Oh, my. 

1421
00:55:02,354 --> 00:55:04,154
- That looks good. / - My blood pressure. 

1422
00:55:06,387 --> 00:55:08,887
(The meatball and the juice taste amazing) 

1423
00:55:08,887 --> 00:55:10,554
Xiaolongbay is the best. 

1424
00:55:10,554 --> 00:55:12,487
- You mean xiaolongbao. / - Xiaolongbao? 

1425
00:55:13,220 --> 00:55:14,620
(Xiaolongbao, $3.36) 

1426
00:55:14,620 --> 00:55:17,887
- Looks good. / - You can't eat dim sum elsewhere now. 

1427
00:55:17,887 --> 00:55:20,154
- But... / - Those are shrimp. 

1428
00:55:20,154 --> 00:55:22,720
- Oh, my. / - You just ordered the basics. 

1429
00:55:22,720 --> 00:55:23,987
These are the basics. 

1430
00:55:23,987 --> 00:55:25,454
- We started with the basics. / - Yes. 

1431
00:55:25,454 --> 00:55:27,387
- Those are shumai. / - Shumai! 

1432
00:55:27,387 --> 00:55:28,520
That's delicious. 

1433
00:55:28,987 --> 00:55:30,320
- That's nice. / - I'll take a photo for you. 

1434
00:55:31,954 --> 00:55:34,620
You took a funny photo, right? 

1435
00:55:35,254 --> 00:55:37,987
(Unlike Ina's worries, she looks pretty in the photo) 

1436
00:55:37,987 --> 00:55:39,120
I'm this kind of woman. 

1437
00:55:39,120 --> 00:55:40,554
She took a really good photo of you. 

1438
00:55:40,554 --> 00:55:42,354
- She's good at taking photos. / - She really is. 

1439
00:55:42,354 --> 00:55:43,654
It really looks like she having her first dim sum there. 

1440
00:55:43,654 --> 00:55:46,254
- We should have also taken photos. / - Yeah. 

1441
00:55:46,254 --> 00:55:47,687
That's a pity. 

1442
00:55:48,887 --> 00:55:52,387
(Hyejin tastes them first) 

1443
00:55:53,854 --> 00:55:55,487
(Ina is nervous for no reason) 

1444
00:55:55,487 --> 00:55:57,054
It has a clean taste. 

1445
00:55:57,054 --> 00:55:59,820
- Everyone will like this. / - That's right. 

1446
00:55:59,820 --> 00:56:01,620
Men and women of all ages will like this. 

1447
00:56:01,620 --> 00:56:04,254
- It tastes clean, right? / - It's really good. 

1448
00:56:05,387 --> 00:56:07,487
They made it with shrimp, mushrooms 

1449
00:56:07,487 --> 00:56:08,620
and shrimp meatballs. 

1450
00:56:08,620 --> 00:56:11,220
A whole shrimp is in here. 

1451
00:56:11,220 --> 00:56:13,487
- The texture is nice. / - A whole shrimp is in here. 

1452
00:56:13,887 --> 00:56:16,387
It feels like just eating the shrimp from shrimp fried rice. 

1453
00:56:16,387 --> 00:56:18,554
It's kind of greasy. 

1454
00:56:19,687 --> 00:56:21,820
(It's time to taste xiaolongbao next) 

1455
00:56:23,487 --> 00:56:25,687
- That was so good. / - Here it is. 

1456
00:56:25,687 --> 00:56:27,054
This... 

1457
00:56:27,054 --> 00:56:29,620
- Are you on our side now? / - What? 

1458
00:56:29,620 --> 00:56:31,454
- Just go over there. / - Will you give me that if I go? 

1459
00:56:31,454 --> 00:56:33,754
You need to tear it on your spoon. 

1460
00:56:33,754 --> 00:56:34,654
- You need to cool them. / - Yes. 

1461
00:56:34,654 --> 00:56:36,487
- It looks so good. / - It's hot because of the juice... 

1462
00:56:36,487 --> 00:56:37,120
So you need to be careful. 

1463
00:56:37,120 --> 00:56:39,987
- It's really good. / - It's really hot. 

1464
00:56:39,987 --> 00:56:41,787
The juice is just popping out. 

1465
00:56:42,520 --> 00:56:46,720
(Tasting the juice first comes when eating xiaolongbao) 

1466
00:56:51,754 --> 00:56:53,720
(Is this right?) 

1467
00:56:54,187 --> 00:56:58,454
(She sees how Hyejin eats and takes a bite right away) 

1468
00:57:01,454 --> 00:57:02,654
It's hot. 

1469
00:57:05,220 --> 00:57:07,387
The one we had before had a good texture 

1470
00:57:07,387 --> 00:57:08,654
because it had seafood. 

1471
00:57:08,654 --> 00:57:10,620
- But the juice is so good for this. / - That is... 

1472
00:57:10,620 --> 00:57:11,987
Xiaolongbao is really... 

1473
00:57:11,987 --> 00:57:13,420
- It's a new world. / - It's a new world. 

1474
00:57:13,420 --> 00:57:16,187
A new world spreads inside your mouth. 

1475
00:57:16,187 --> 00:57:21,054
Those dumplings are like Korean stalked sea squirt. 

1476
00:57:21,054 --> 00:57:22,287
You need to be careful when you eat them. 

1477
00:57:22,287 --> 00:57:24,220
- Sea squirt? / - Because it bursts? 

1478
00:57:24,220 --> 00:57:25,287
You need to be careful when it bursts. 

1479
00:57:25,287 --> 00:57:26,954
Stalked sea squirt? 

1480
00:57:26,954 --> 00:57:28,620
You know what donkotsu ramen is, right? 

1481
00:57:29,554 --> 00:57:31,720
Donkotsu ramen in Japan. 

1482
00:57:31,954 --> 00:57:34,187
This tastes like that soup. It feels like they condensed 

1483
00:57:34,187 --> 00:57:36,920
the soup and put it in the meatballs, right? 

1484
00:57:37,854 --> 00:57:40,220
You have quite a unique palate. 

1485
00:57:41,887 --> 00:57:44,187
- This is really good. / - I had this for the first time. 

1486
00:57:44,187 --> 00:57:45,454
- That's really good. / - Yes. 

1487
00:57:45,454 --> 00:57:47,454
- That looks good. / - It's really good. 

1488
00:57:47,454 --> 00:57:49,420
- This is what I hate the most. / - What is it? 

1489
00:57:49,420 --> 00:57:52,020
Two people usually come to eat in restaurants, right? 

1490
00:57:52,020 --> 00:57:53,787
But what should you do when they give you three? 

1491
00:57:53,787 --> 00:57:56,787
I usually don't give up food but I'll give it up for you. 

1492
00:57:56,787 --> 00:57:59,854
Ina can eat two of those since Hyejin is on a diet. 

1493
00:57:59,854 --> 00:58:02,054
- You should order one more. / - That's right. 

1494
00:58:02,054 --> 00:58:03,287
You can eat three of them each. 

1495
00:58:03,287 --> 00:58:05,954
But we ordered a lot of other things too. 

1496
00:58:05,954 --> 00:58:07,287
- There's more? / - Yes. 

1497
00:58:08,654 --> 00:58:09,687
It's so cute! 

1498
00:58:11,987 --> 00:58:13,420
(Her eyes are fixed) 

1499
00:58:13,420 --> 00:58:14,687
It's so cute! 

1500
00:58:15,154 --> 00:58:17,654
- How are we going to eat these? / - Oh, dear. 

1501
00:58:17,654 --> 00:58:19,220
Is it the duck shaped dim sum from earlier? 

1502
00:58:19,220 --> 00:58:20,554
- What is it? / - It's a torture. 

1503
00:58:20,554 --> 00:58:22,520
- Panda! / - Panda. 

1504
00:58:22,854 --> 00:58:26,454
- It's cute. / - That's the signature dish there. 

1505
00:58:26,454 --> 00:58:28,520
- It's really cute. / - It's really delicious. 

1506
00:58:28,520 --> 00:58:29,787
- Is it delicious? / - It's delicious. 

1507
00:58:29,787 --> 00:58:32,320
I think if you go there with children, 

1508
00:58:32,320 --> 00:58:34,120
they won't whine. 

1509
00:58:34,120 --> 00:58:36,287
- That's scary. They are birds. / - Right? 

1510
00:58:36,287 --> 00:58:37,920
- I'm so scared. / - They are birds. 

1511
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:39,287
- So scary. / - They look the same as that bird. 

1512
00:58:39,287 --> 00:58:40,854
Do you eat it whole? 

1513
00:58:40,854 --> 00:58:42,387
- It's fried, isn't it? / - That's cruel! 

1514
00:58:42,387 --> 00:58:43,920
It's so cute! 

1515
00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:46,154
I don't think I can eat that. 

1516
00:58:46,154 --> 00:58:47,687
- What do we do? / - You must take photos. 

1517
00:58:47,687 --> 00:58:48,720
Right? 

1518
00:58:48,720 --> 00:58:51,687
- She's good at taking photos. / - Let's try them. 

1519
00:58:51,687 --> 00:58:53,087
I feel sorry. 

1520
00:58:54,387 --> 00:58:56,054
There must be cheese inside them. 

1521
00:58:56,054 --> 00:58:58,154
- It smells so good. / - Do they have red beans inside? 

1522
00:58:58,154 --> 00:58:59,154
No? Is it meat? 

1523
00:58:59,154 --> 00:59:00,087
- It's coming out. / - Oh, my! 

1524
00:59:00,087 --> 00:59:01,587
- What is that? / - I'm so surprised. 

1525
00:59:01,587 --> 00:59:02,320
Oh, my God. 

1526
00:59:02,320 --> 00:59:03,620
Cheese? 

1527
00:59:03,620 --> 00:59:05,354
- What is that? / - I'm so surprised. 

1528
00:59:05,354 --> 00:59:07,054
- Oh, my God! / - Cheese? 

1529
00:59:13,020 --> 00:59:14,320
I'm sorry. 

1530
00:59:14,987 --> 00:59:16,454
It's hot, so be careful. 

1531
00:59:16,454 --> 00:59:18,254
(They apologize and take a bite each) 

1532
00:59:19,554 --> 00:59:22,620
- It's flowing. / - It kind of feels like a pumpkin. 

1533
00:59:22,620 --> 00:59:24,187
It also kind of feels like cheese. 

1534
00:59:24,187 --> 00:59:25,620
I thought that it was cheese. 

1535
00:59:25,620 --> 00:59:28,254
It's custard, so it's sweet. 

1536
00:59:28,254 --> 00:59:29,754
But it's not that sweet. 

1537
00:59:29,754 --> 00:59:30,954
It's a little less sweet than custard. 

1538
00:59:30,954 --> 00:59:33,554
- It's custard. / - It's sweet egg custard. 

1539
00:59:33,654 --> 00:59:34,987
That must be good. 

1540
00:59:34,987 --> 00:59:36,687
- It was so good. / - It's sweet custard. 

1541
00:59:37,087 --> 00:59:41,154
I never had this before in other dim sum places. 

1542
00:59:41,154 --> 00:59:42,187
The custard is kind of... 

1543
00:59:42,187 --> 00:59:44,087
- Flowing. / - It's overflowing. 

1544
00:59:44,087 --> 00:59:47,154
- It helps to appreciate the flavor. / - It's charming. 

1545
00:59:47,554 --> 00:59:49,087
This really suits my taste. 

1546
00:59:49,087 --> 00:59:51,354
- It's overflowing. / - Children... 

1547
00:59:51,354 --> 00:59:52,854
Will like to eat these. 

1548
00:59:52,854 --> 00:59:53,987
It's the ultimate move. 

1549
00:59:53,987 --> 00:59:55,887
- It's quite characteristic. / - Yes. 

1550
00:59:55,887 --> 00:59:58,454
I'm sorry but I will also eat you. 

1551
00:59:58,454 --> 01:00:00,854
They must have fried these. Gosh! 

1552
01:00:00,854 --> 01:00:02,720
Did you eat the heads after pulling them off? 

1553
01:00:02,720 --> 01:00:04,987
- We did. / - So cruel. 

1554
01:00:06,620 --> 01:00:08,520
- Are those ducks? / - Yes, they're ducks. 

1555
01:00:10,054 --> 01:00:11,587
(What does the duck dim sum taste like?) 

1556
01:00:11,587 --> 01:00:12,754
The juice is flowing. 

1557
01:00:14,120 --> 01:00:16,687
The juice came out when I took a bite... 

1558
01:00:16,687 --> 01:00:18,420
- So I thought it was curry. / - Oh, my! 

1559
01:00:19,020 --> 01:00:20,854
- I think it was duck meat and pork. / - It must be pork. 

1560
01:00:20,854 --> 01:00:22,854
- That looks delicious. / - It was delicious. 

1561
01:00:22,854 --> 01:00:23,954
- It looks delicious. / - They mixed... 

1562
01:00:23,954 --> 01:00:26,820
- Duck meat and pork. / - That's why it's duck shaped. 

1563
01:00:26,820 --> 01:00:28,487
- It kind of smells like curry. / - Curry. 

1564
01:00:28,487 --> 01:00:30,387
Kids these days will really like this. 

1565
01:00:30,387 --> 01:00:31,420
You get a good variety. 

1566
01:00:31,420 --> 01:00:33,620
Plus, there are things that kids will like. 

1567
01:00:33,620 --> 01:00:36,487
- It's so cute. / - It's not a traditional place. 

1568
01:00:36,487 --> 01:00:39,020
- They make fusion dim sums. / - Fusion. 

1569
01:00:39,020 --> 01:00:40,520
It will be really nice to go with your family. 

1570
01:00:40,520 --> 01:00:41,120
You can order... 

1571
01:00:41,120 --> 01:00:43,220
- That for the kids to see. / - That will be the best. 

1572
01:00:43,220 --> 01:00:44,354
Are you done? 

1573
01:00:44,887 --> 01:00:46,087
Are you full? 

1574
01:00:46,087 --> 01:00:47,287
(They head off to their next itinerary) 

1575
01:00:47,287 --> 01:00:49,087
Go! Thank you for the food. 

1576
01:00:49,520 --> 01:00:50,887
(Ina's Day for Hyejin) 

1577
01:00:50,887 --> 01:00:54,454
(Dragon's Back) 

1578
01:00:55,054 --> 01:00:58,354
They said, "Thank you" in Korean for us. 

1579
01:00:58,354 --> 01:01:00,620
- How will we go there? / - If you didn't rent a car... 

1580
01:01:00,620 --> 01:01:03,254
They say that the fastest way to go to Dragon's Back... 

1581
01:01:03,820 --> 01:01:05,354
Is to take the subway. 

1582
01:01:06,720 --> 01:01:09,787
How to go to Dragon's Back. 

1583
01:01:09,787 --> 01:01:11,820
Take the MTR. 

1584
01:01:11,820 --> 01:01:16,487
Take bus 9 at exit A3. 

1585
01:01:16,487 --> 01:01:18,887
Get off at Cape Collinson station. 

1586
01:01:18,887 --> 01:01:22,654
I can show off to mom now. 

1587
01:01:24,620 --> 01:01:25,654
Where do we have to get off? 

1588
01:01:25,654 --> 01:01:28,554
We have to get off at Shau Kei Wan. 

1589
01:01:29,287 --> 01:01:30,787
And take bus 9. 

1590
01:01:30,787 --> 01:01:32,287
Do we have to take the bus as well? 

1591
01:01:32,287 --> 01:01:34,687
- Yes, but that's the fastest way. / - Really? 

1592
01:01:34,687 --> 01:01:36,487
You have to decrease the costs with this. 

1593
01:01:36,487 --> 01:01:37,754
Ina, you're doing a good job. 

1594
01:01:37,754 --> 01:01:38,987
You must have matched your outfits. 

1595
01:01:38,987 --> 01:01:40,754
- Yes, we matched our outfits. / - Yes. 

1596
01:01:40,754 --> 01:01:42,687
- We also matched our outfits. / - Yes. 

1597
01:01:42,687 --> 01:01:44,887
(They take the Hong Kong MTR Island Line) 

1598
01:01:45,287 --> 01:01:49,887
(30 minutes by bus to the final stop) 

1599
01:01:50,587 --> 01:01:53,654
Dragon's Back starts from here. 

1600
01:01:53,654 --> 01:01:55,887
We got off from the bus station. 

1601
01:01:55,887 --> 01:01:57,154
This is the entrance. 

1602
01:01:57,154 --> 01:01:59,754
It's right here. 

1603
01:01:59,754 --> 01:02:01,387
(The trekking course is located right next to the stop) 

1604
01:02:01,387 --> 01:02:04,087
It starts in front of the bus stop. 

1605
01:02:04,087 --> 01:02:05,554
- That's nice. / - There's a dragon again. 

1606
01:02:05,554 --> 01:02:07,387
- It looks like a dragon's back. / - That place? 

1607
01:02:07,387 --> 01:02:08,654
- Yes. / - That's why it's Dragon's Back. 

1608
01:02:08,654 --> 01:02:10,054
Ina, do you also like to work out usually? 

1609
01:02:10,054 --> 01:02:11,620
Yes, I like to walk. 

1610
01:02:11,620 --> 01:02:13,154
- Tell us the truth. / - I really do. 

1611
01:02:13,154 --> 01:02:15,654
- Gosh. / - I hike once a day... 

1612
01:02:15,654 --> 01:02:16,820
With my dog. 

1613
01:02:16,820 --> 01:02:18,220
I feel bad for your dog. 

1614
01:02:18,220 --> 01:02:19,420
What? 

1615
01:02:20,154 --> 01:02:22,720
I just feel bad for your dog's knees. 

1616
01:02:22,720 --> 01:02:24,554
I think dogs can come here too. 

1617
01:02:24,554 --> 01:02:27,654
It's slightly uphill here. 

1618
01:02:28,820 --> 01:02:30,787
- From the start? / - Yes. 

1619
01:02:31,820 --> 01:02:33,187
Bamboo... 

1620
01:02:33,887 --> 01:02:35,720
- Yes, bamboo. / - There's lots of bamboo. 

1621
01:02:35,720 --> 01:02:37,287
I wish there were pandas too. 

1622
01:02:38,120 --> 01:02:40,287
There aren't any here. 

1623
01:02:41,020 --> 01:02:41,720
It's my little wish. 

1624
01:02:41,720 --> 01:02:44,787
It feels more like China and Hong Kong 

1625
01:02:44,787 --> 01:02:47,454
than Korean mountains because there's bamboo. 

1626
01:02:48,520 --> 01:02:50,620
Does it have to have bamboo to feel like China? 

1627
01:02:50,620 --> 01:02:52,254
Yes, of course. 

1628
01:02:53,020 --> 01:02:54,987
I heard that there aren't a lot of fork roads there. 

1629
01:02:55,454 --> 01:02:56,520
You won't get lost that way. 

1630
01:02:56,520 --> 01:02:58,187
- That's right. / - You just have to go straight. 

1631
01:02:58,187 --> 01:02:59,654
Since it only has one road? 

1632
01:02:59,654 --> 01:03:00,754
Some paths are wide open. 

1633
01:03:00,754 --> 01:03:02,654
Do you go back down the path that you climb up? 

1634
01:03:02,654 --> 01:03:03,920
- Yes. / - Gosh. 

1635
01:03:03,920 --> 01:03:09,354
(They're stepping towards the top of the mountain) 

1636
01:03:09,354 --> 01:03:11,387
Mom, but I'm already tired. 

1637
01:03:11,387 --> 01:03:13,854
You will get used to it once you hike a little bit more. 

1638
01:03:15,420 --> 01:03:18,354
Let's see. 

1639
01:03:18,354 --> 01:03:19,787
(Hyejin wants to rest while watching the view) 

1640
01:03:19,787 --> 01:03:22,087
You should also look at the sky. 

1641
01:03:23,787 --> 01:03:25,420
There is a big boat over there. 

1642
01:03:25,420 --> 01:03:27,154
(Climb a little and you can see a different Hong Kong) 

1643
01:03:27,154 --> 01:03:28,520
It's so amazing. 

1644
01:03:30,120 --> 01:03:31,354
There really is a big boat. 

1645
01:03:31,354 --> 01:03:32,987
- It's way up there, right? / - It's way up there. 

1646
01:03:32,987 --> 01:03:34,254
Isn't it so amazing? 

1647
01:03:34,254 --> 01:03:35,520
According to my search, 

1648
01:03:35,520 --> 01:03:37,654
our destination has a far prettier view. 

1649
01:03:37,654 --> 01:03:38,720
- Really? / - Yes. 

1650
01:03:38,720 --> 01:03:41,620
- Let's go then. / - We only walked for 8 minutes. 

1651
01:03:41,620 --> 01:03:43,687
(They recovered their strength after a short rest) 

1652
01:03:43,687 --> 01:03:45,720
How many hours was that course? 

1653
01:03:45,720 --> 01:03:47,120
It was a 3-hour course. 

1654
01:03:47,120 --> 01:03:49,120
- A 3-hour course? / - It was 8.5km. 

1655
01:03:49,120 --> 01:03:51,154
I'd rather be on a boat for 6 hours 

1656
01:03:51,154 --> 01:03:52,320
than walk for 3 hours. 

1657
01:03:53,554 --> 01:03:55,520
- I did a good job, right? / - Yes. 

1658
01:03:55,520 --> 01:03:57,054
You're the best. 

1659
01:03:57,054 --> 01:03:59,320
If you do this during your trip, 

1660
01:03:59,320 --> 01:04:00,554
it will make your meal taste better. 

1661
01:04:00,554 --> 01:04:02,087
- If you don't do this... / - If you make a round... 

1662
01:04:02,087 --> 01:04:03,954
- Your swelling will subside fast. / - Yes. 

1663
01:04:03,954 --> 01:04:06,387
- Yes. / - The sunlight is also so pretty. 

1664
01:04:06,387 --> 01:04:07,487
(They recharge and head off again) 

1665
01:04:07,487 --> 01:04:09,720
The trekking course is so pretty. 

1666
01:04:09,720 --> 01:04:11,954
(They've traveled a third of the way) 

1667
01:04:11,954 --> 01:04:16,720
(There are magnificent views everywhere) 

1668
01:04:19,387 --> 01:04:21,320
The view is so amazing. 

1669
01:04:21,320 --> 01:04:25,287
(It's not a difficult course due to gentle slopes) 

1670
01:04:25,820 --> 01:04:27,120
The weather is also really nice. 

1671
01:04:27,120 --> 01:04:30,754
If you get into trekking, you'll keep at it. 

1672
01:04:30,754 --> 01:04:31,520
Isn't it so nice? 

1673
01:04:31,520 --> 01:04:34,220
Yes, that's why you search for courses. 

1674
01:04:38,887 --> 01:04:41,120
She works out a lot. 

1675
01:04:41,120 --> 01:04:42,720
Hyejin really works out a lot. 

1676
01:04:44,820 --> 01:04:46,854
People must go all the way up there. 

1677
01:04:46,854 --> 01:04:48,554
Don't you think so? 

1678
01:04:49,520 --> 01:04:51,054
Ina, will it be okay for you? 

1679
01:04:51,054 --> 01:04:53,054
I don't think I'll be okay. 

1680
01:04:53,854 --> 01:04:55,587
I tried walking for a long time 

1681
01:04:55,587 --> 01:04:58,920
but I don't think this is really hard. 

1682
01:04:58,920 --> 01:05:01,020
- 8.5km? / - 8.5km... 

1683
01:05:01,020 --> 01:05:02,354
Is a piece of cake. 

1684
01:05:03,087 --> 01:05:05,287
I didn't walk for a long time, so I'm tired. 

1685
01:05:05,787 --> 01:05:07,720
I think she's kind of having a hard time. 

1686
01:05:09,220 --> 01:05:10,787
It's so hot right now. 

1687
01:05:11,487 --> 01:05:12,620
You shouldn't rest too much 

1688
01:05:12,620 --> 01:05:14,154
when you're tired during trekking. 

1689
01:05:14,154 --> 01:05:16,554
- You shouldn't rest. / - You shouldn't rest. 

1690
01:05:16,554 --> 01:05:17,954
It's the water of life. 

1691
01:05:17,954 --> 01:05:19,854
- We need it. / - We'll be in trouble without it. 

1692
01:05:19,854 --> 01:05:20,687
(She holds it tightly in her hands) 

1693
01:05:20,687 --> 01:05:21,987
How many kilometers did we walk? 

1694
01:05:21,987 --> 01:05:23,920
We've come about a quarter of the way. 

1695
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:25,120
A quarter? 

1696
01:05:25,120 --> 01:05:26,687
I'm sure we walked more. 

1697
01:05:26,687 --> 01:05:28,287
A quarter plus 0.5. 

1698
01:05:29,887 --> 01:05:31,720
(Does she really mean it?) 

1699
01:05:33,087 --> 01:05:35,120
(They were energetic in the beginning) 

1700
01:05:35,120 --> 01:05:38,920
(But their strength is decreasing gradually) 

1701
01:05:41,320 --> 01:05:43,187
It's a piece of cake. 

1702
01:05:44,087 --> 01:05:46,220
It's a piece of cake. 

1703
01:05:46,654 --> 01:05:50,454
(Hyejin climbs up without giving up until the end) 

1704
01:05:52,220 --> 01:05:53,354
(Shocked) 

1705
01:05:53,354 --> 01:05:54,420
Mom. 

1706
01:05:56,387 --> 01:05:57,120
Mom! 

1707
01:05:58,487 --> 01:05:59,687
What can they see? 

1708
01:05:59,687 --> 01:06:01,054
- Wow! / - Can they see the sea? 

1709
01:06:01,054 --> 01:06:02,287
It was so pretty. 

1710
01:06:02,287 --> 01:06:05,287
Everything was spread out and open. 

1711
01:06:05,787 --> 01:06:08,920
(Wow) 

1712
01:06:15,320 --> 01:06:17,654
- The wind feels so nice. / - I really like it. 

1713
01:06:17,654 --> 01:06:20,487
I don't care if the wind makes my hair messy. 

1714
01:06:21,254 --> 01:06:23,420
It doesn't feel like Hong Kong from up there. 

1715
01:06:23,420 --> 01:06:26,387
- It felt like Europe. / - What is this? 

1716
01:06:26,387 --> 01:06:28,854
- Did they have a beach like this? / - Right? 

1717
01:06:34,820 --> 01:06:37,920
(The moment when their long journey bores fruit) 

1718
01:06:37,920 --> 01:06:39,287
It's so pretty. 

1719
01:06:40,720 --> 01:06:45,787
(The view is unbelievable even when they're seeing it) 

1720
01:06:46,920 --> 01:06:49,620
- The feel of the wind. / - Doesn't it feel so good? 

1721
01:06:49,620 --> 01:06:50,354
Pretend to be weak. 

1722
01:06:50,354 --> 01:06:52,787
I'm going to be blown down by the wind. 

1723
01:06:52,787 --> 01:06:54,620
(They must feel energetic to make jokes) 

1724
01:06:54,620 --> 01:06:55,520
I'm going to be blown down by the wind. 

1725
01:06:55,520 --> 01:06:56,554
Isn't it so nice? 

1726
01:06:56,554 --> 01:06:57,987
This is a small but certain happiness. 

1727
01:06:57,987 --> 01:06:59,787
Do you know that? 

1728
01:06:59,787 --> 01:07:01,820
Small but certain happiness. 

1729
01:07:01,820 --> 01:07:03,287
Small but certain happiness. 

1730
01:07:03,287 --> 01:07:04,387
(Okay) 

1731
01:07:04,387 --> 01:07:05,254
It's hard, right? 

1732
01:07:05,254 --> 01:07:08,287
You got used to sweet and salty. 

1733
01:07:08,287 --> 01:07:10,154
(You're giving me a hard time) 

1734
01:07:10,920 --> 01:07:12,820
Can you see where all the people are gathered? 

1735
01:07:12,820 --> 01:07:16,120
I guess people take more pictures over there. 

1736
01:07:16,387 --> 01:07:18,387
It kind of feels like the Grand Canyon. 

1737
01:07:18,387 --> 01:07:19,920
- Have you been there? / - No. 

1738
01:07:19,920 --> 01:07:23,054
Why do you talk like you've been to everywhere? 

1739
01:07:23,054 --> 01:07:25,387
- Let's go over there, show off... / - Okay. 

1740
01:07:25,387 --> 01:07:26,387
And pretend like we've been there before. 

1741
01:07:26,387 --> 01:07:28,220
- Let's go. / - Let's take the best photo. 

1742
01:07:28,220 --> 01:07:30,187
(They move to take the best photos of their lives) 

1743
01:07:31,087 --> 01:07:33,587
- Mom, does this pose look good? / - Yes. 

1744
01:07:33,587 --> 01:07:35,654
(Yay) 

1745
01:07:35,654 --> 01:07:37,187
Mamma Mia! 

1746
01:07:37,187 --> 01:07:38,754
That was awesome. 

1747
01:07:39,187 --> 01:07:41,354
(Shouting on Dragon's Back, Mamma Mia) 

1748
01:07:41,854 --> 01:07:46,787
(Ina takes photos of a running Hyejin this time) 

1749
01:07:49,054 --> 01:07:49,887
(The travel master takes unique photos) 

1750
01:07:49,887 --> 01:07:51,087
- Paparazzi shots. / - What is this? 

1751
01:07:51,087 --> 01:07:53,254
- What is this? / - I took sequential photos. 

1752
01:07:53,254 --> 01:07:54,987
- It looks scary. / - Sequential photos. 

1753
01:07:54,987 --> 01:07:55,654
What is that? 

1754
01:07:55,654 --> 01:07:58,320
It's kind of like the computer graphics of "Ureme." 

1755
01:08:01,120 --> 01:08:03,887
- It's so nice. / - Isn't it so nice? 

1756
01:08:03,887 --> 01:08:05,054
I didn't realize it earlier 

1757
01:08:05,054 --> 01:08:07,587
why CNN chose this but I think I know now. 

1758
01:08:07,587 --> 01:08:09,387
- That must feel good. / - It's so pretty. 

1759
01:08:09,654 --> 01:08:13,220
- The path we took is winding. / - Yes. 

1760
01:08:13,220 --> 01:08:15,220
It really looks like a dragon's back. 

1761
01:08:15,220 --> 01:08:17,654
I guess that's why it's called Dragon's Back. 

1762
01:08:17,654 --> 01:08:20,954
I can see everything from here. 

1763
01:08:22,520 --> 01:08:24,120
It was hot earlier but it's cold now. 

1764
01:08:24,120 --> 01:08:25,654
- Isn't that right? / - Yes. 

1765
01:08:25,654 --> 01:08:27,687
We could fly from here. 

1766
01:08:28,220 --> 01:08:29,387
Let's go! 

1767
01:08:30,220 --> 01:08:31,320
(Their teamwork is perfect) 

1768
01:08:31,320 --> 01:08:32,520
Oh, my. 

1769
01:08:32,854 --> 01:08:35,287
(You can actually enjoy paragliding on Dragon's Back) 

1770
01:08:35,287 --> 01:08:38,054
We indirectly experienced paragliding. 

1771
01:08:38,654 --> 01:08:40,154
- Oh, my. / - Let's go! 

1772
01:08:40,154 --> 01:08:41,787
- The wind was so strong. / - I was so surprised. 

1773
01:08:41,787 --> 01:08:44,320
- Such great CGI. / - To save money on paragliding. 

1774
01:08:44,820 --> 01:08:46,354
It's so nice. 

1775
01:08:46,354 --> 01:08:48,154
I don't know how to explain it. 

1776
01:08:48,154 --> 01:08:51,154
It's the best if you see this for yourself. 

1777
01:08:51,154 --> 01:08:54,454
If you come to Hong Kong, 

1778
01:08:54,454 --> 01:08:57,287
you should make time for half a day or a day. 

1779
01:08:57,287 --> 01:08:59,620
I think it's a good idea to experience this. 

1780
01:08:59,620 --> 01:09:02,087
You meant that it will be nice... 

1781
01:09:02,087 --> 01:09:03,854
- To come to Dragon's Back, right? / - That's right. 

1782
01:09:03,854 --> 01:09:05,654
I didn't even know that there was 

1783
01:09:05,654 --> 01:09:07,887
a trekking course in the city. 

1784
01:09:08,620 --> 01:09:10,587
The more I get to know it, the more I like it. 

1785
01:09:10,587 --> 01:09:12,420
That's the charm, isn't it? 

1786
01:09:12,420 --> 01:09:14,987
This is the last course of Ina's Day. 

1787
01:09:14,987 --> 01:09:16,854
I heard that spicy crabs are famous in Hong Kong. 

1788
01:09:16,854 --> 01:09:20,854
Let's end this hardship by eating spicy food. 

1789
01:09:20,854 --> 01:09:22,587
- Let's go then. / - Let's go, mom. 

1790
01:09:26,387 --> 01:09:28,487
(I liked every single moment we were together) 

1791
01:09:28,487 --> 01:09:30,054
She's really good at taking photos. 

1792
01:09:30,054 --> 01:09:31,187
(Ina's Day for Hyejin) 

1793
01:09:31,187 --> 01:09:32,320
- It's the last supper. / - It's the last supper. 

1794
01:09:32,320 --> 01:09:34,120
- I'm worried about this. / - What did they eat? 

1795
01:09:34,120 --> 01:09:36,720
- What could it be? / - Please stop eating. 

1796
01:09:36,720 --> 01:09:38,754
I really agree with that saying earlier. 

1797
01:09:38,754 --> 01:09:41,220
It's scary because you know the taste. 

1798
01:09:41,220 --> 01:09:43,820
- I'm about to go insane. / - That's the scariest thing. 

1799
01:09:43,820 --> 01:09:46,220
That's right, I know that taste. 

1800
01:09:46,220 --> 01:09:47,854
I'll just take a short break. 

1801
01:09:48,287 --> 01:09:53,120
(From Shau Kei Wan to Causeway Bay) 

1802
01:09:53,520 --> 01:09:56,254
(The last night arrives with the end of the trek) 

1803
01:09:56,887 --> 01:09:59,054
(Where did they go for their last supper?) 

1804
01:09:59,820 --> 01:10:01,454
(Causeway Bay) 

1805
01:10:01,454 --> 01:10:03,787
(Hong Kong's commercial area, popular among youth) 

1806
01:10:04,320 --> 01:10:06,454
There are a lot of things here. 

1807
01:10:06,454 --> 01:10:08,620
- Isn't that right? / - There are a lot of restaurants. 

1808
01:10:08,620 --> 01:10:11,254
- Causeway Bay. / - I'll take you to the... 

1809
01:10:11,487 --> 01:10:14,520
Crab restaurant that is the most famous thing here. 

1810
01:10:14,520 --> 01:10:15,287
Crabs? 

1811
01:10:15,287 --> 01:10:17,020
- I told you earlier. / - It's over now. 

1812
01:10:17,020 --> 01:10:19,787
- We're going to eat spicy crabs. / - I'm worried. 

1813
01:10:19,787 --> 01:10:21,287
Spicy? 

1814
01:10:21,287 --> 01:10:22,454
It's over now. 

1815
01:10:23,287 --> 01:10:25,220
- That's a lot. / - Garlic. 

1816
01:10:25,220 --> 01:10:26,587
You all know this, right? 

1817
01:10:26,587 --> 01:10:29,087
Fried food taste good with any sauce. 

1818
01:10:29,087 --> 01:10:31,420
- Gosh. / - Don't pour that on top. 

1819
01:10:31,954 --> 01:10:33,254
That looks so good. 

1820
01:10:33,254 --> 01:10:34,220
- Oh, my. / - Gosh. 

1821
01:10:35,787 --> 01:10:38,854
Your fingernails will continue to smell if you do that. 

1822
01:10:39,687 --> 01:10:42,254
- Your fingernails will smell. / - Until you shampoo. 

1823
01:10:42,254 --> 01:10:43,254
It won't disappear until you shampoo your hair. 

1824
01:10:43,254 --> 01:10:44,454
You have to wash your hair. 

1825
01:10:48,620 --> 01:10:49,620
- It's here. / - Wow. 

1826
01:10:50,420 --> 01:10:52,254
(An impressive sight) 

1827
01:10:53,454 --> 01:10:56,020
It's the representative dish... 

1828
01:10:56,020 --> 01:10:58,087
- The crab dish. / - Yes. 

1829
01:10:58,087 --> 01:10:59,487
(Spicy crab, $96.30) 

1830
01:10:59,487 --> 01:11:00,687
Let's try it. 

1831
01:11:00,687 --> 01:11:02,820
(What will the spicy crab taste like?) 

1832
01:11:03,554 --> 01:11:04,787
Listen to that sound. 

1833
01:11:04,787 --> 01:11:06,987
(Crispy) 

1834
01:11:07,920 --> 01:11:10,187
- We know that taste. / - It's really good. 

1835
01:11:11,287 --> 01:11:12,654
- Isn't it delicious? / - Yes. 

1836
01:11:12,654 --> 01:11:14,054
(What is Hyejin's evaluation?) 

1837
01:11:14,054 --> 01:11:15,387
It's good. 

1838
01:11:15,820 --> 01:11:17,320
Thank goodness. 

1839
01:11:17,320 --> 01:11:19,987
(Ina also takes a bite) 

1840
01:11:19,987 --> 01:11:22,254
- What will she do now? / - You'll lose a tooth. 

1841
01:11:22,254 --> 01:11:23,720
(Ina is puzzled. Hyejin thinks that Ina is cute) 

1842
01:11:23,720 --> 01:11:25,654
Were you looking at me like that? 

1843
01:11:26,187 --> 01:11:28,187
She tried to crack it with her teeth. 

1844
01:11:28,187 --> 01:11:29,987
She's similar to Sandeul. 

1845
01:11:30,720 --> 01:11:32,087
It was so funny. 

1846
01:11:32,087 --> 01:11:33,687
(Ina is puzzled, Hyejin finds her cute) 

1847
01:11:34,887 --> 01:11:36,220
I should crack it here. 

1848
01:11:36,220 --> 01:11:37,720
(She even uses tools) 

1849
01:11:37,720 --> 01:11:39,320
She doesn't know how to use that. 

1850
01:11:39,320 --> 01:11:40,654
I can't crack it. 

1851
01:11:40,654 --> 01:11:42,420
(Hyejin does it for Ina) 

1852
01:11:42,420 --> 01:11:43,720
It's slippery. 

1853
01:11:45,054 --> 01:11:46,454
(Oh, so cool) 

1854
01:11:46,454 --> 01:11:48,920
- Thank you. / - That's the wisdom of life. 

1855
01:11:48,920 --> 01:11:50,620
- Like this. / - Wisdom? 

1856
01:11:50,620 --> 01:11:51,987
You can do that when you become an adult. 

1857
01:11:51,987 --> 01:11:54,587
(What will the crab taste like?) 

1858
01:11:55,954 --> 01:11:57,520
(It's delicious) 

1859
01:11:57,520 --> 01:11:59,254
How can you explain this taste? 

1860
01:11:59,987 --> 01:12:01,020
It tastes like garlic. 

1861
01:12:03,354 --> 01:12:04,920
It really is. 

1862
01:12:04,920 --> 01:12:08,820
It was fried with garlic, so it has a savory aroma. 

1863
01:12:08,820 --> 01:12:09,754
It also has green onions. 

1864
01:12:09,754 --> 01:12:10,854
When you eat it with the green onions, 

1865
01:12:10,854 --> 01:12:13,954
it tastes salty and spicy. 

1866
01:12:13,954 --> 01:12:18,620
You can chew on the shell if the shell is thin. 

1867
01:12:18,620 --> 01:12:21,687
It's really crispy. The flesh is also tender. 

1868
01:12:22,587 --> 01:12:23,820
It's really good. 

1869
01:12:23,820 --> 01:12:27,820
(It's a perfect combination with the tender crab meat) 

1870
01:12:27,820 --> 01:12:30,987
At a glance, that garlic may seem like salt. 

1871
01:12:30,987 --> 01:12:32,687
Because it's salty. 

1872
01:12:32,687 --> 01:12:35,554
- All of the food is quite salty. / - Yes. 

1873
01:12:35,554 --> 01:12:37,920
It's really delicious if you brush them off. 

1874
01:12:37,920 --> 01:12:40,820
The crab dish is meaningless without the garlic. 

1875
01:12:40,820 --> 01:12:43,387
- That's right. / - When we usually eat crabs... 

1876
01:12:43,387 --> 01:12:45,620
We just steam them, 

1877
01:12:45,620 --> 01:12:47,887
marinate them in soy sauce 

1878
01:12:47,887 --> 01:12:49,420
or marinate them in spicy sauce to eat them. 

1879
01:12:49,420 --> 01:12:54,087
Eating crabs like this isn't common in Korea. 

1880
01:12:54,087 --> 01:12:57,554
- It's really uncommon. / - That's why it's unique. 

1881
01:12:58,720 --> 01:13:01,187
This itself has a strong taste. 

1882
01:13:01,187 --> 01:13:03,387
- The crab is just a helping hand. / - Yes. 

1883
01:13:03,387 --> 01:13:04,520
(Fantastic combination with the light taste of crab) 

1884
01:13:05,320 --> 01:13:06,887
Are most crabs... 

1885
01:13:07,320 --> 01:13:08,887
Usually big like this? 

1886
01:13:09,320 --> 01:13:11,220
This is the delicious part. 

1887
01:13:11,220 --> 01:13:13,387
(The claws are the best part) 

1888
01:13:13,387 --> 01:13:17,787
(Will it taste different from ordinary crab?) 

1889
01:13:18,854 --> 01:13:20,754
I've got you, claw. 

1890
01:13:22,387 --> 01:13:26,320
(She takes a bite right away) 

1891
01:13:26,854 --> 01:13:28,187
It's really fresh. 

1892
01:13:28,620 --> 01:13:29,787
This is really... 

1893
01:13:29,787 --> 01:13:30,987
(Ina also takes a big bite) 

1894
01:13:31,754 --> 01:13:34,554
(Her face reacts first from the impressive taste) 

1895
01:13:36,887 --> 01:13:38,687
- The meat is so delicious. / - Yes. 

1896
01:13:39,820 --> 01:13:41,454
The meat is so delicious. 

1897
01:13:41,720 --> 01:13:44,987
The meat is really bouncy and tender. 

1898
01:13:44,987 --> 01:13:46,120
It's so delicious. 

1899
01:13:49,554 --> 01:13:50,887
This is how you eat crabs. 

1900
01:13:51,487 --> 01:13:53,320
I'll find out what's inside the shell. 

1901
01:13:53,954 --> 01:13:55,687
(Surprised) 

1902
01:13:56,354 --> 01:13:57,954
(Hyejin first gives a piece of crab meat to Ina) 

1903
01:13:57,954 --> 01:13:59,354
- You should eat. / - What is that? 

1904
01:13:59,354 --> 01:14:01,254
- It's the intestines. / - It's the intestines. 

1905
01:14:01,254 --> 01:14:02,454
You have to eat that. 

1906
01:14:02,454 --> 01:14:04,087
- Mom, you should eat. / - Eat. 

1907
01:14:04,487 --> 01:14:06,387
I'm taking the entire shell. 

1908
01:14:06,387 --> 01:14:07,787
(Hyejin eats while holding an entire crab shell) 

1909
01:14:07,787 --> 01:14:09,320
The meat on the shell. 

1910
01:14:10,254 --> 01:14:12,087
That's right. You have to eat it with rice. 

1911
01:14:12,087 --> 01:14:14,287
- Eat some bokchoy. / - It's like fried marinated crab. 

1912
01:14:14,287 --> 01:14:16,320
- That's right. / - Fried marinated crab? 

1913
01:14:17,354 --> 01:14:20,220
- The seasoning is strong, right? / - It has to be good. 

1914
01:14:20,220 --> 01:14:23,687
- Chinese people eat their food salty. / - Yes. 

1915
01:14:23,687 --> 01:14:27,020
- It's perfectly seasoned for them. / - Perfect for them. 

1916
01:14:27,587 --> 01:14:28,754
Why don't we eat some rice? 

1917
01:14:30,254 --> 01:14:34,154
(You can't leave out fried rice while eating spicy crab) 

1918
01:14:34,754 --> 01:14:35,854
I like that rice. 

1919
01:14:35,854 --> 01:14:38,220
- Me too, I really like that rice. / - Me too. 

1920
01:14:38,220 --> 01:14:40,220
People think that it won't make you gain weight 

1921
01:14:40,220 --> 01:14:41,187
but that's wrong. 

1922
01:14:42,287 --> 01:14:43,754
- It makes you gain weight. / - Yeah. 

1923
01:14:44,187 --> 01:14:46,220
- That'd be good mixed. / - You gain less weight. 

1924
01:14:46,220 --> 01:14:47,920
I admit that this looks good. 

1925
01:14:47,920 --> 01:14:49,754
- This was really good. / - I admit that this looks good. 

1926
01:14:51,620 --> 01:14:54,654
(She takes a big bite) 

1927
01:14:55,554 --> 01:14:56,754
(She's satisfied) 

1928
01:14:56,754 --> 01:14:57,887
It's so delicious. 

1929
01:14:59,220 --> 01:15:01,854
(Ina also takes a bite) 

1930
01:15:04,220 --> 01:15:06,654
It kind of tastes like crab meat burgers. 

1931
01:15:07,320 --> 01:15:08,620
It tastes like crab meat burgers? 

1932
01:15:08,620 --> 01:15:10,954
Could you taste crab meat burgers from that? 

1933
01:15:10,954 --> 01:15:13,454
She said that because she thought it was so delicious. 

1934
01:15:13,454 --> 01:15:16,120
- Crab meat burgers? / - Stop nitpicking. 

1935
01:15:16,520 --> 01:15:19,554
We all have different tastes. 

1936
01:15:19,554 --> 01:15:22,820
But it tastes good because of the garlic. 

1937
01:15:23,454 --> 01:15:25,354
It's nice with the rice. 

1938
01:15:25,354 --> 01:15:26,987
(Combination of salty garlic flakes and savory fried rice) 

1939
01:15:28,087 --> 01:15:29,854
You have to eat it with vegetables. 

1940
01:15:29,854 --> 01:15:31,620
- Eat it with vegetables. / - If you go to China... 

1941
01:15:31,620 --> 01:15:33,187
You should always order vegetables on the side. 

1942
01:15:33,187 --> 01:15:34,954
- You have to eat vegetables. / - You have to. 

1943
01:15:34,954 --> 01:15:38,620
- Morning glory. / - They have a wide variety. 

1944
01:15:38,620 --> 01:15:39,787
It doesn't smell. 

1945
01:15:39,787 --> 01:15:42,187
What are you doing when you brought me here? 

1946
01:15:43,120 --> 01:15:47,387
(She tries it to not make Hyejin mad) 

1947
01:15:47,387 --> 01:15:48,954
- She doesn't like it. / - She doesn't like it? 

1948
01:15:48,954 --> 01:15:50,420
She doesn't eat vegetables at all. 

1949
01:15:50,420 --> 01:15:53,554
- I don't eat it at all. / - I eat all of the vegetables. 

1950
01:15:53,554 --> 01:15:54,987
- Of course. / - Really? 

1951
01:15:54,987 --> 01:15:55,787
They're delicious. 

1952
01:15:55,787 --> 01:15:57,420
It just tastes like oil to me. 

1953
01:15:57,420 --> 01:15:59,054
- The oil taste is delicious. / - Yes. 

1954
01:15:59,054 --> 01:16:01,754
- It's really good. / - Isn't it really good? 

1955
01:16:01,754 --> 01:16:02,920
No, it isn't. 

1956
01:16:02,920 --> 01:16:04,154
The seasoning is... 

1957
01:16:04,320 --> 01:16:05,820
- A little strong, right? / - Yes. 

1958
01:16:05,820 --> 01:16:08,687
The vegetables and fried rice 

1959
01:16:08,687 --> 01:16:11,020
dilutes the strong seasoning a little bit. 

1960
01:16:11,020 --> 01:16:12,654
The seasoning is too strong, 

1961
01:16:12,654 --> 01:16:14,054
so you can't help but eat vegetables. 

1962
01:16:14,454 --> 01:16:16,987
I think it's quite successful. 

1963
01:16:16,987 --> 01:16:19,154
We will have to eat until the end to know that. 

1964
01:16:19,154 --> 01:16:20,554
The fried rice looks really good. 

1965
01:16:20,554 --> 01:16:22,654
I sometimes order more morning glory. 

1966
01:16:22,654 --> 01:16:24,587
- There are a lot of vegetables. / - Yes. 

1967
01:16:24,587 --> 01:16:26,454
You need to order stir-fried vegetables no matter what. 

1968
01:16:26,454 --> 01:16:29,287
(Mamma Mia eats all of the food up in no time) 

1969
01:16:29,287 --> 01:16:31,687
- When will Hyejin start her diet? / - Greed. 

1970
01:16:32,320 --> 01:16:33,954
What are we going to do about it? 

1971
01:16:33,954 --> 01:16:35,187
You? 

1972
01:16:36,220 --> 01:16:37,387
(She laughed so much, she started to drool) 

1973
01:16:37,387 --> 01:16:38,654
Can you see this? 

1974
01:16:38,654 --> 01:16:40,220
♪ Can you see this? ♪ 

1975
01:16:40,220 --> 01:16:42,354
(You can see the traces of an intense meal) 

1976
01:16:42,787 --> 01:16:44,754
I had rice grains stuck on my mouth while eating. 

1977
01:16:44,754 --> 01:16:46,754
I probably have a lot stuck on me. 

1978
01:16:48,054 --> 01:16:50,520
- You didn't disappoint me. / - Thank goodness. 

1979
01:16:50,520 --> 01:16:51,887
Thank you for trying. 

1980
01:16:52,720 --> 01:16:55,054
I got to see sides of you that I didn't know about. 

1981
01:16:55,054 --> 01:16:56,487
People who don't get along well 

1982
01:16:56,487 --> 01:16:58,220
can break up during trips. 

1983
01:16:58,220 --> 01:17:00,820
But people in good relationships can grow deeper 

1984
01:17:00,820 --> 01:17:02,687
and continue for a long time. 

1985
01:17:02,687 --> 01:17:05,787
I think we're going to be a good case. 

1986
01:17:05,787 --> 01:17:07,254
I think we have a deep relationship already. 

1987
01:17:07,254 --> 01:17:08,687
I'm going to wait depending on what you do. 

1988
01:17:09,354 --> 01:17:11,554
(Mamma Mia's deepening trip is over now) 

1989
01:17:11,554 --> 01:17:15,720
(Hyejin's Day for Ina) 

1990
01:17:15,720 --> 01:17:17,220
Personally, 

1991
01:17:17,220 --> 01:17:19,520
I really enjoyed the trekking and dim sum. 

1992
01:17:19,520 --> 01:17:20,954
- It's a course that I like. / - Yes. 

1993
01:17:25,854 --> 01:17:29,354
Actually, I like to be active. 

1994
01:17:29,354 --> 01:17:31,220
That's why I work out a lot. 

1995
01:17:31,220 --> 01:17:34,220
But the tip that Hong Kong had 

1996
01:17:34,220 --> 01:17:35,387
such a beautiful trekking course... 

1997
01:17:35,387 --> 01:17:36,887
- Was shocking to me. / - That's right. 

1998
01:17:36,887 --> 01:17:38,554
- It's not far. You could go there. / - It's close. 

1999
01:17:38,554 --> 01:17:42,287
Men who like to work out will run up there. 

2000
01:17:42,287 --> 01:17:45,320
Beginners and men and women of all ages 

2001
01:17:45,320 --> 01:17:46,554
can trek up Dragon's Back. 

2002
01:17:46,554 --> 01:17:48,154
But if you like trekking, 

2003
01:17:48,154 --> 01:17:49,854
there are lots of other courses as well, 

2004
01:17:49,854 --> 01:17:51,087
other than Dragon's Back. 

2005
01:17:51,087 --> 01:17:53,054
- Okay. / - So you should look them up. 

2006
01:17:53,054 --> 01:17:55,320
- Is there an admission fee? / - No. 

2007
01:17:55,320 --> 01:17:56,620
- Can you just go in? / - Yes, you can just go in. 

2008
01:17:56,620 --> 01:17:59,087
- You can just go in. / - Get off of bus 9. 

2009
01:17:59,087 --> 01:18:00,987
This is important. I heard that Ina 

2010
01:18:00,987 --> 01:18:02,620
prepared something like... 

2011
01:18:02,954 --> 01:18:04,454
A gift to celebrate this trip. 

2012
01:18:04,454 --> 01:18:06,254
- What? / - Really? 

2013
01:18:06,254 --> 01:18:07,054
I took a lot of photos 

2014
01:18:07,054 --> 01:18:09,454
but it would be a pity to just have them on my phone. 

2015
01:18:09,454 --> 01:18:11,454
Oh, my God. 

2016
01:18:12,320 --> 01:18:14,454
Women do things like this. 

2017
01:18:14,454 --> 01:18:15,487
She's so considerate. 

2018
01:18:15,487 --> 01:18:17,954
- What is that? / - Look at Jungyu's face. 

2019
01:18:17,954 --> 01:18:19,787
- "What is that?" / - Look at Jungyu's face. 

2020
01:18:19,787 --> 01:18:21,487
- It's pretty. / - Isn't it pretty? 

2021
01:18:21,920 --> 01:18:24,287
- It's a calendar. / - A calendar. 

2022
01:18:26,554 --> 01:18:28,387
With the photos we took... 

2023
01:18:29,020 --> 01:18:31,287
- How did you make that? / - Look carefully. 

2024
01:18:31,287 --> 01:18:32,787
I can't recover my senses. 

2025
01:18:32,787 --> 01:18:35,254
This is October, next year October. 

2026
01:18:35,854 --> 01:18:37,620
- This is for next year. / - This is next September. 

2027
01:18:37,620 --> 01:18:39,587
- This will be so memorable. / - That's right. 

2028
01:18:39,587 --> 01:18:42,654
- It's like a poster. / - You'd remember for a year. 

2029
01:18:43,420 --> 01:18:47,054
Men could never come up with an idea like this. 

2030
01:18:47,054 --> 01:18:49,020
There's a reason why Ina is so loved. 

2031
01:18:49,020 --> 01:18:51,954
You should have at least prepared goat bones. 

2032
01:18:51,954 --> 01:18:53,754
- Should I wear the horns like this? / - Yes, the horns. 

2033
01:18:53,754 --> 01:18:54,987
You received a surprise gift. 

2034
01:18:54,987 --> 01:18:56,220
- How was it? / - I'm so surprised. 

2035
01:18:56,220 --> 01:18:58,187
If I knew about this, I would've prepared something. 

2036
01:18:58,187 --> 01:18:59,754
I didn't prepare anything. 

2037
01:18:59,754 --> 01:19:02,254
I'm so thankful. I was touched for a moment. 

2038
01:19:02,254 --> 01:19:03,687
I feel so proud. Thank you. 

2039
01:19:03,687 --> 01:19:05,020
- Okay. / - Okay. 

2040
01:19:05,587 --> 01:19:07,820
Let's find out the expenses now. 

2041
01:19:07,820 --> 01:19:10,654
Ssangdeulier Tour went on an airplane tour... 

2042
01:19:10,654 --> 01:19:13,620
- So they spent $415. / - Yes. 

2043
01:19:13,620 --> 01:19:16,620
Excluding the airfare, let's find out 

2044
01:19:16,620 --> 01:19:18,787
Mamma Mia Tour's final expense. 

2045
01:19:18,787 --> 01:19:19,887
Hyejin! 

2046
01:19:19,887 --> 01:19:20,954
Per person... 

2047
01:19:22,387 --> 01:19:25,287
(Will it be less than Ha Long Bay's expenses?) 

2048
01:19:25,287 --> 01:19:26,587
- How much is the expense? / - $500... 

2049
01:19:26,587 --> 01:19:27,987
- What? / - $500? 

2050
01:19:27,987 --> 01:19:29,154
$510. 

2051
01:19:29,887 --> 01:19:31,254
- $510? / - That's not a big difference. 

2052
01:19:31,254 --> 01:19:32,620
- That's not a big difference. / - That's right. 

2053
01:19:32,620 --> 01:19:34,054
- It's a $60 difference. / - Actually... 

2054
01:19:34,054 --> 01:19:35,987
Hong Kong is a lot more expensive... 

2055
01:19:35,987 --> 01:19:38,454
- If you think about the cost of living. / - Right. 

2056
01:19:38,454 --> 01:19:39,287
That's why you should go... 

2057
01:19:39,287 --> 01:19:41,620
- With someone who knows a lot. / - That's right. 

2058
01:19:41,620 --> 01:19:43,354
We didn't take taxis... 

2059
01:19:43,354 --> 01:19:45,620
- And went on ferries. / - You walked a little. 

2060
01:19:45,620 --> 01:19:47,887
If you walk a little, it's enough so 

2061
01:19:47,887 --> 01:19:50,187
you won't have to spend a lot of money. 

2062
01:19:50,187 --> 01:19:52,554
That's good. Thank goodness. 

2063
01:19:52,554 --> 01:19:54,020
Just choose. 

2064
01:19:54,020 --> 01:19:56,354
You can go to Vietnam and stay like a king 

2065
01:19:56,354 --> 01:19:59,254
or have a really hard time in Hong Kong. 

2066
01:19:59,254 --> 01:20:00,354
- That's right. / - You will have to walk... 

2067
01:20:00,354 --> 01:20:03,054
- For 8.5km. / - We made a mistake while... 

2068
01:20:03,054 --> 01:20:04,220
Ordering food once. That was quite expensive. 

2069
01:20:04,220 --> 01:20:05,387
- Yes. / - Really? 

2070
01:20:05,387 --> 01:20:07,654
- When you ate hot pot? / - Yes, if you look into it... 

2071
01:20:07,654 --> 01:20:09,254
- When you ate hot pot. / - The prices will be similar. 

2072
01:20:09,254 --> 01:20:11,920
We continued to make mistakes while ordering food. 

2073
01:20:12,454 --> 01:20:15,120
We didn't care about the amount. 

2074
01:20:15,120 --> 01:20:17,354
- That's right. / - We ordered a lot but it's cheap. 

2075
01:20:17,354 --> 01:20:19,420
Why worry about the amount? 

2076
01:20:19,420 --> 01:20:20,487
Whether you want to order freely 

2077
01:20:20,487 --> 01:20:22,087
or stress every time you order food. 

2078
01:20:22,087 --> 01:20:23,087
You can choose between that. 

2079
01:20:23,787 --> 01:20:25,254
That's good. 

2080
01:20:25,254 --> 01:20:27,420
Would you like to go to Hong Kong 

2081
01:20:27,420 --> 01:20:28,320
according to Mamma Mia Tour? 

2082
01:20:28,320 --> 01:20:30,887
- Please vote! / - Please vote! 

2083
01:20:31,920 --> 01:20:35,420
(They designed a family trip with parents) 

2084
01:20:35,420 --> 01:20:38,587
(What will the judges choose?) 

2085
01:20:38,587 --> 01:20:39,920
Will it be Ssangdeulier Tour's 

2086
01:20:39,920 --> 01:20:42,787
trip to Ha Long Bay, Vietnam? 

2087
01:20:42,787 --> 01:20:45,854
Or will it be Mamma Mia Tour's trip to Hong Kong? 

2088
01:20:45,854 --> 01:20:48,620
What will the judges choose? 

2089
01:20:48,787 --> 01:20:51,387
(Hong Kong vs. Ha Long Bay) 

2090
01:20:51,387 --> 01:20:52,987
Will it be Vietnam or Hong Kong? 

2091
01:20:52,987 --> 01:20:55,187
Will it be Ssangdeulier or Mamma Mia? 

2092
01:20:55,187 --> 01:20:56,420
- It's coming out. / - First... 

2093
01:20:56,420 --> 01:20:57,987
- Is this "Immortal Songs?" / - The first digit! 

2094
01:20:58,454 --> 01:21:03,554
- "Immortal Songs" and us. / - The last digit is 8! 

2095
01:21:04,220 --> 01:21:05,654
- What is happening? / - It must be so close. 

2096
01:21:05,654 --> 01:21:08,220
- It's close. / - If it's a 2-vote difference... 

2097
01:21:08,220 --> 01:21:09,787
- No! / - It's 7, 8, 9. 

2098
01:21:09,787 --> 01:21:11,287
- No! / - Is it 98? 

2099
01:21:11,287 --> 01:21:12,820
- Is it 98? / - 2 votes? 

2100
01:21:13,320 --> 01:21:14,620
- No! / - It's 7, 8, 9. 

2101
01:21:14,620 --> 01:21:16,420
- Is it 98? / - 2 votes? 

2102
01:21:16,420 --> 01:21:20,387
(Ha Long Bay wins with 90 votes) 

2103
01:21:22,987 --> 01:21:25,187
- They got 90 votes. / - That shirt is really cute. 

2104
01:21:25,187 --> 01:21:27,020
- It's 90 votes. / - We won. 

2105
01:21:27,487 --> 01:21:29,120
- This is impossible. / - It happened. 

2106
01:21:29,120 --> 01:21:31,554
- It's a 12-vote difference. / - Yes. 

2107
01:21:31,554 --> 01:21:32,920
Hyejin, I know you're sad 

2108
01:21:32,920 --> 01:21:34,120
but could you say something? 

2109
01:21:34,120 --> 01:21:36,654
I think that Ha Long Bay is a really nice trip location. 

2110
01:21:36,654 --> 01:21:38,354
- It was really cost effective. / - Yes. 

2111
01:21:38,354 --> 01:21:40,420
The contents were also meaningful. 

2112
01:21:40,420 --> 01:21:43,554
I also want to go there next time. 

2113
01:21:43,554 --> 01:21:45,454
- Call me. / - Yes. 

2114
01:21:46,120 --> 01:21:47,754
What will you do if she calls you? 

2115
01:21:47,754 --> 01:21:49,454
I'm going to take her there. 

2116
01:21:49,454 --> 01:21:50,987
(They make corny dad jokes until the end) 

2117
01:21:51,220 --> 01:21:54,087
- NC.A was the host for 2 weeks. / - Yes. 

2118
01:21:54,087 --> 01:21:55,820
Between Ha Long Bay and Hong Kong, 

2119
01:21:55,820 --> 01:21:56,654
where would you rather go? 

2120
01:21:56,654 --> 01:21:58,420
- Be honest. / - I want to go to Hong Kong. 

2121
01:21:58,420 --> 01:21:59,887
- With your mom? / - Yes. 

2122
01:21:59,887 --> 01:22:02,520
It's because I really like Chinese food. 

2123
01:22:02,520 --> 01:22:04,854
While watching the Hong Kong episode, 

2124
01:22:04,854 --> 01:22:07,020
I just kept thinking, "I want to go there..." 

2125
01:22:07,020 --> 01:22:09,887
- And "I want to eat that." / - Did you write a lot down? 

2126
01:22:09,887 --> 01:22:10,787
- She wrote a lot. / - I wrote a lot. 

2127
01:22:10,787 --> 01:22:14,687
- She wrote a lot about Hong Kong. / - Like this. 

2128
01:22:14,687 --> 01:22:16,954
She wrote the entire Hong Kong route. 

2129
01:22:16,954 --> 01:22:18,254
I can see that. 

2130
01:22:18,254 --> 01:22:19,720
She must've really disliked Vietnam episode. 

2131
01:22:19,720 --> 01:22:21,520
No, that's not it. 

2132
01:22:21,520 --> 01:22:23,154
- I didn't hate it. / - Women will like Hong Kong. 

2133
01:22:23,154 --> 01:22:23,554
- Yes. / - Yes. 

2134
01:22:23,554 --> 01:22:27,220
We will take a week off due to the awards. 

2135
01:22:27,220 --> 01:22:29,954
The week after, we will come back... 

2136
01:22:29,954 --> 01:22:31,254
With a special that will highlight the end of 2018. 

2137
01:22:31,254 --> 01:22:33,154
- It's already the end. / - Yes. 

2138
01:22:33,154 --> 01:22:35,454
We prepared a lot of unaired footage... 

2139
01:22:35,454 --> 01:22:37,487
- That we couldn't air, right? / - Yes. 

2140
01:22:37,487 --> 01:22:38,787
We will come back 2 weeks later. 

2141
01:22:38,787 --> 01:22:41,354
We will see you next time. 

2142
01:22:41,354 --> 01:22:43,220
The world is your school. Life is a journey. 

2143
01:22:43,220 --> 01:22:46,220
Battle Trip!
