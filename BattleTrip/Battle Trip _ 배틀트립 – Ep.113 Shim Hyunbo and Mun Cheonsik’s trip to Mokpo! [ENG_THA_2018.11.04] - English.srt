(100 judges in the audience) 

27
00:00:58,975 --> 00:01:01,575
Last week, Peak Father and Son Tour 

28

went to Danyang and it was amazing. 

29
00:01:03,275 --> 00:01:03,975
We won, right? 

30
00:01:03,975 --> 00:01:05,441
Choi Taeseong told us a lot of 

31
00:01:05,441 --> 00:01:06,908
fun stories about history. 

32
00:01:07,075 --> 00:01:09,175

33
00:01:09,175 --> 00:01:10,041
I liked spicy mandarin fish stew. 

34
00:01:10,041 --> 00:01:11,041
Spicy mandarin fish stew. 

35
00:01:11,275 --> 00:01:12,275
- I see. / - It's famous. 

36
00:01:12,275 --> 00:01:14,841
Wondering what your hidden card is while watching 

37
00:01:14,841 --> 00:01:16,841
made it more fun and absorbing. 

38
00:01:16,841 --> 00:01:18,708
- Right? / - You should probably start worrying. 

39
00:01:18,708 --> 00:01:20,675
We're fine. We have our hidden card too. 

40
00:01:21,108 --> 00:01:23,241
There are good foods everywhere in Korea. 

41
00:01:23,241 --> 00:01:24,075
- Yes. / - But... 

42
00:01:24,075 --> 00:01:26,041
We'll show you why Jeolla-do is known for good food. 

43
00:01:26,041 --> 00:01:28,875
- Yes. / - And our hidden card is... 

44
00:01:28,875 --> 00:01:30,908
- Very powerful. / - Is it?

47
00:01:35,508 --> 00:01:38,941

49
00:01:39,941 --> 00:01:41,775
Please tell us about this person. 

50
00:01:42,041 --> 00:01:45,675
He's a host of a travel related radio show. 

51
00:01:46,008 --> 00:01:48,275
He even wrote a book about good restaurants. 

52
00:01:48,275 --> 00:01:49,175
He's a good photographer too. 

53
00:01:49,175 --> 00:01:50,508
He takes great pictures too. 

54
00:01:50,508 --> 00:01:51,841
He's a well-rounded man. 

55
00:01:51,841 --> 00:01:55,008
- Really? / - I'm so curious. Let's meet him. 

56

57
00:01:56,941 --> 00:01:58,075
(Who is their hidden card?) 

58
00:02:00,475 --> 00:02:01,608
Hey. 

59
00:02:01,708 --> 00:02:03,308
- Hello. / - He's our hidden card. 

60
00:02:03,308 --> 00:02:04,575
Meet our hidden card. 

61
00:02:04,575 --> 00:02:07,075
All of them have been the guest of my radio show. 

62
00:02:07,075 --> 00:02:08,541
- Yes. / - Each of them. 

63
00:02:08,908 --> 00:02:09,808
- All of us. / - On different days? 

64
00:02:09,808 --> 00:02:11,441
Yes, it's nice to see them here. 

65
00:02:11,441 --> 00:02:14,608
Actually, I'm very thankful to Sikyung. 

66
00:02:14,975 --> 00:02:16,975
- Why? / - He's like a teacher to me. 

67
00:02:17,375 --> 00:02:19,075
He taught me how to attract the radio listeners. 

68
00:02:19,075 --> 00:02:21,375
My radio show totally flipped. 

69
00:02:21,908 --> 00:02:23,441
- It really did. / - "Good night?" 

70
00:02:23,441 --> 00:02:25,341
- I know it did. / - "Good night." 

71
00:02:25,341 --> 00:02:26,508
"Good night" totally flipped. 

72
00:02:26,508 --> 00:02:29,775
Mr. Noh, I heard you have an interesting way 

73
00:02:29,775 --> 00:02:30,975
to find good restaurants. 

74
00:02:31,241 --> 00:02:32,575
I can tell you one thing. 

75
00:02:32,575 --> 00:02:34,508
Find grass-roots restaurants. 

76
00:02:34,508 --> 00:02:36,608
- What does that mean? / - Grass-roots means... 

77
00:02:36,608 --> 00:02:38,675
Restaurants that have been open for a long time. 

78
00:02:38,675 --> 00:02:41,675
Small, shabby and old ones. 

79
00:02:41,675 --> 00:02:43,675
Those restaurants are not famous 

80
00:02:43,675 --> 00:02:45,141
on mass media or SNS. 

81
00:02:45,408 --> 00:02:47,875
If there are a lot of middle-aged 

82
00:02:47,875 --> 00:02:50,008
or old ladies in a restaurant, 

83
00:02:50,008 --> 00:02:50,908
it's definitely a good restaurant. 

84
00:02:51,775 --> 00:02:53,775
Because they usually cook at home, 

85
00:02:53,775 --> 00:02:54,608
they don't eat out often. 

86
00:02:54,608 --> 00:02:56,941
Rather than young people? 

87
00:02:57,375 --> 00:02:59,941
- Exactly. / - These days... 

88
00:02:59,941 --> 00:03:02,341
There are so many recommendations on the internet. 

89
00:03:02,341 --> 00:03:03,708
It's hard to figure out if those are 

90
00:03:03,708 --> 00:03:04,841
actually good restaurants. 

91
00:03:04,841 --> 00:03:06,008
It's hard to find good ones. 

92
00:03:06,008 --> 00:03:08,141
Then Mr. Noh, have you ever failed 

93
00:03:08,141 --> 00:03:08,641
in finding a good restaurant? 

94
00:03:08,641 --> 00:03:10,808
Sikyung and I almost never fail. 

95
00:03:11,141 --> 00:03:12,241
I can give you some tips. 

96
00:03:12,241 --> 00:03:15,108
First, find signs that look old. 

97
00:03:15,108 --> 00:03:17,475
Second, find restaurants that only have one dish. 

98
00:03:17,675 --> 00:03:20,408
- Only one? / - Third, no menu is even better. 

99
00:03:20,408 --> 00:03:21,608
No menu? 

100
00:03:21,608 --> 00:03:22,641
The owner will treat you as he or she pleases. 

101
00:03:22,641 --> 00:03:25,108
- He loves humble places. / - I do. 

102
00:03:25,108 --> 00:03:26,108
We have the same taste. 

103
00:03:26,108 --> 00:03:28,908
We introduced him as our hidden card but actually, 

104
00:03:28,908 --> 00:03:31,408
every single restaurant he picked 

105
00:03:31,408 --> 00:03:33,141
and every single dish he picked are our hidden cards. 

106
00:03:33,141 --> 00:03:35,375
- They're all hidden cards. / - You won't be disappointed. 

107
00:03:35,375 --> 00:03:35,741
Right. 

108
00:03:35,741 --> 00:03:37,941
Were you traveling together for the two entire days? 

109
00:03:37,941 --> 00:03:39,341
- Yes. / - Yes. 

110
00:03:39,341 --> 00:03:40,808
We were traveling together the whole time. 

111
00:03:40,808 --> 00:03:42,741
- Really? / - I planned everything. 

112
00:03:42,741 --> 00:03:44,708
Then Junghun should've been the planner. 

113
00:03:44,708 --> 00:03:46,741
- He's the main planner. / - He's not a hidden card. 

114
00:03:46,741 --> 00:03:48,541
- He's the main. / - The two of you are hidden cards. 

115
00:03:48,541 --> 00:03:49,841
He's not a hidden card. 

116
00:03:49,841 --> 00:03:52,041
- I'd like to ask a question. / - The focus. 

117
00:03:52,041 --> 00:03:54,341
What should we know in advance 

118
00:03:54,341 --> 00:03:55,108
before watching your trip? 

119
00:03:55,108 --> 00:03:58,008
Mokpo is the essence of Jeollanam-do cuisines. 

120
00:03:58,008 --> 00:04:00,941
Mokpo is the best place to travel if you want to learn 

121
00:04:00,941 --> 00:04:03,008
about the modern cultural heritage and history. 

122
00:04:03,008 --> 00:04:04,141
Is that so? 

123
00:04:04,141 --> 00:04:06,375
Have you heard of "dark tourism?" 

124
00:04:06,375 --> 00:04:08,641
- No. / - What is dark tourism? 

125
00:04:08,641 --> 00:04:10,475
It means to travel to the cities or towns where 

126
00:04:10,475 --> 00:04:13,041
there were crises like wars or natural disasters. 

127
00:04:13,041 --> 00:04:15,608
By visiting the places, 

128
00:04:15,608 --> 00:04:16,841
you can learn about the past. 

129
00:04:16,841 --> 00:04:18,908
You can experience the wound in person. 

130
00:04:18,908 --> 00:04:20,408
That's dark tourism. 

131
00:04:20,408 --> 00:04:21,708
During the Japanese colonial era, 

132
00:04:21,708 --> 00:04:23,508
Gunsan and Mokpo are the cities... 

133
00:04:23,508 --> 00:04:25,208
- That were plundered the most. / - Yes. 

134
00:04:25,208 --> 00:04:27,675
There are a lot of buildings built in that era. 

135
00:04:27,675 --> 00:04:29,175
It's the best place to check out 

136
00:04:29,175 --> 00:04:31,175
modern cultural heritage by foot. 

137
00:04:31,175 --> 00:04:32,008
It's Mokpo. 

138
00:04:32,308 --> 00:04:34,908
Mr. Noh, doesn't this side of your face hurt a bit? 

139
00:04:34,908 --> 00:04:37,041
- Why? / - Jinah has been glaring at you. 

140
00:04:37,041 --> 00:04:38,808
- I see. / - He's not glaring. 

141
00:04:38,808 --> 00:04:39,941
He's just fascinated. 

142
00:04:39,941 --> 00:04:42,541
I thought he was pretty old. 

143
00:04:43,608 --> 00:04:44,975
What are you talking about? 

144
00:04:45,641 --> 00:04:46,808
I thought he was older than me. 

145
00:04:46,808 --> 00:04:49,141
- He thought he was older than him. / - Come on. 

146
00:04:49,141 --> 00:04:51,141
- Jinah, he's not married. / - That was a low blow. 

147
00:04:51,141 --> 00:04:52,375
I really thought so. 

148
00:04:53,175 --> 00:04:56,075
Anyway, we'll be looking forward to your contribution.

- Really? / - Was that your song? 

164

Those songs are all composed by him. 

165

Kangnam didn't know it until now. 

171
00:05:46,908 --> 00:05:47,808
He's a rich man. 

172
00:05:47,808 --> 00:05:50,141
- Awesome. / - He's looking at him differently. 

173
00:05:50,141 --> 00:05:52,208
He was condescending to him earlier. 

174

178
00:06:02,975 --> 00:06:04,141
It's the best show in KBS. 

179
00:06:04,141 --> 00:06:05,641
When you feel bored and 

180
00:06:05,641 --> 00:06:07,141
want to escape from the everyday lives, 

181
00:06:07,141 --> 00:06:09,475
watch Battle Trip and it will motivate you to travel. 

182
00:06:10,508 --> 00:06:11,508
It's a great show. 

183
00:06:11,508 --> 00:06:13,141
He's a great seller. 

184
00:06:13,975 --> 00:06:14,975
So, where are we going? 

185
00:06:14,975 --> 00:06:16,841
Can we go somewhere far away? 

186
00:06:17,108 --> 00:06:19,141
This week's theme is a domestic fall trip. 

187
00:06:19,141 --> 00:06:20,908
- Domestic fall trip. / - Domestic fall trip. 

188
00:06:21,108 --> 00:06:23,008
We have a problem here. I've been on this show. 

189
00:06:23,008 --> 00:06:25,241
- You were once on the show. / - I went to Japan... 

190
00:06:25,241 --> 00:06:26,908
With Sikyung. 

191
00:06:26,908 --> 00:06:28,675
If you don't have anything special, 

192
00:06:28,675 --> 00:06:30,808
you will lose the competition. 

193
00:06:30,808 --> 00:06:32,275
So we need a strategy. 

194
00:06:32,275 --> 00:06:32,841
You need a strategy. 

195
00:06:32,841 --> 00:06:35,175
If you don't do anything like Hwijae, 

196
00:06:35,175 --> 00:06:37,075
if you just eat and sightsee... 

197
00:06:37,075 --> 00:06:38,241
If you do it like Hwijae, you'll lose. 

198
00:06:38,241 --> 00:06:39,241
You're right. 

199
00:06:40,808 --> 00:06:42,875
Who are our opponents? 

200
00:06:42,875 --> 00:06:43,975
I heard they had someone else with them. 

201
00:06:43,975 --> 00:06:46,108
Yes, they're with an expert. 

202
00:06:46,941 --> 00:06:49,208
It will be hard with us two alone. 

203
00:06:50,308 --> 00:06:51,308
(Sighing) 

204
00:06:52,075 --> 00:06:53,241
Do you know anyone? 

205
00:06:54,141 --> 00:06:55,708
Let me type, "travel." 

206
00:06:55,908 --> 00:06:58,708
Someone who knows a lot about traveling and food. 

207
00:06:58,708 --> 00:07:01,341
- I have one person in mind. / - You do? 

208
00:07:01,341 --> 00:07:02,975
We meet him from time to time. 

209
00:07:02,975 --> 00:07:04,575
(The two meet him from time to time?) 

210
00:07:05,075 --> 00:07:06,441
- Mr. Noh? / - Yes. 

211
00:07:06,441 --> 00:07:09,641
It's Mr. Noh. 

212
00:07:10,308 --> 00:07:13,508
(They call him right away) 

213
00:07:13,508 --> 00:07:15,941
Hello. Where are you? 

214
00:07:15,941 --> 00:07:17,941
Cheonsik and I are on Battle Trip and 

215
00:07:17,941 --> 00:07:19,541
we need an expert in our team. 

216
00:07:19,775 --> 00:07:22,275
I think it'd be nice if you could come over now 

217
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:23,241
and talk more. 

218
00:07:23,241 --> 00:07:24,675
Okay. We'll be waiting for you. 

219
00:07:25,275 --> 00:07:28,241
He has been to almost every country. 

220
00:07:28,241 --> 00:07:30,241
He's been to many foreign countries too. 

221
00:07:30,241 --> 00:07:31,741
The best thing about him is... 

222
00:07:32,441 --> 00:07:34,975
That he knows a lot of small local restaurants 

223
00:07:34,975 --> 00:07:35,675
he found himself. 

224
00:07:35,675 --> 00:07:38,941
Right, I follow him on SNS as well. 

225
00:07:38,941 --> 00:07:41,408
He goes to all kinds of interesting places. 

226
00:07:43,308 --> 00:07:45,275
- Here he is. / - Come in. 

227
00:07:45,275 --> 00:07:45,908
It didn't take you long. 

228
00:07:46,675 --> 00:07:48,575
It's a little embarrassing to say this myself. 

229
00:07:48,575 --> 00:07:49,608
It's okay. 

230
00:07:49,608 --> 00:07:51,308
You might not know well about me 

231
00:07:51,308 --> 00:07:54,708
but I'm a living legend in the world of travel writers. 

232
00:07:54,708 --> 00:07:55,975
He looks like a comedian. 

233
00:07:55,975 --> 00:07:58,141
This is what annoys me. 

234
00:07:58,908 --> 00:08:01,275
I'm a living legend in the world of travel writers. 

235
00:08:01,808 --> 00:08:03,908
- Right? / - Yes. 

236
00:08:03,908 --> 00:08:05,275
A travel writer with 20 years of experience, 

237
00:08:05,275 --> 00:08:05,908
I'm Noh Junghun. 

238
00:08:06,508 --> 00:08:08,208
Travel writer Noh Junghun. 

239
00:08:08,208 --> 00:08:10,308
We feel very confident with you here. 

240
00:08:10,375 --> 00:08:13,475
(Noh Junghun, professional travel writer) 

241
00:08:13,475 --> 00:08:16,075
Whenever I have a foreign guest, 

242
00:08:16,075 --> 00:08:19,508
I ask him where I can take this guest to. 

243
00:08:19,841 --> 00:08:21,208
Then he sends me a long list of restaurants. 

244
00:08:21,208 --> 00:08:22,108
Goodness. 

245
00:08:22,108 --> 00:08:24,441
He's an important person. 

246
00:08:24,441 --> 00:08:26,241
Many of the restaurants are places I've never been. 

247
00:08:27,308 --> 00:08:29,341
(How did you three first meet?) 

248
00:08:29,341 --> 00:08:32,075
We were all guests of Sikyung's radio show. 

249
00:08:32,075 --> 00:08:32,941
- We were all guests. / - That's right. 

250
00:08:32,941 --> 00:08:34,775
- On different days. / - Tuesday's guest, 

251
00:08:34,775 --> 00:08:36,141
I was Saturday's guest, and he was Sunday's guest. 

252
00:08:36,141 --> 00:08:37,941
But we weren't on the show on the same day. 

253
00:08:37,941 --> 00:08:39,441
Then you can't meet each other. 

254
00:08:39,441 --> 00:08:41,608
We had a gathering together every day. 

255
00:08:41,608 --> 00:08:42,808
(Alcohol brought the four of them together) 

256
00:08:42,808 --> 00:08:44,808
We waited each other until the show finished. 

257
00:08:44,808 --> 00:08:46,041
It was a get-together. 

258
00:08:46,875 --> 00:08:48,508
Cheonsik and I are going on a trip and 

259
00:08:48,508 --> 00:08:50,008
you're our hidden card. 

260
00:08:50,008 --> 00:08:51,308
Who's on your opposing team? 

261
00:08:51,675 --> 00:08:53,275
We don't know. 

262
00:08:53,275 --> 00:08:54,841
Could you at least tell me if they have a travel writer? 

263
00:08:54,841 --> 00:08:56,141
They don't? 

264
00:08:56,141 --> 00:08:57,741
- Good. Because... / - Why do you ask that? 

265
00:08:57,741 --> 00:08:59,741
- I'm a travel writer. / - If they did... 

266
00:08:59,741 --> 00:09:00,308
You feel like we'll lose? 

267
00:09:00,308 --> 00:09:01,775
That's not it. What are you talking about? 

268
00:09:01,775 --> 00:09:03,141
If they did, you feel like we'll lose. 

269
00:09:03,141 --> 00:09:05,708
If I lose the competition with the tour I planned, 

270
00:09:05,708 --> 00:09:07,875
although I don't know who my opponent is... 

271
00:09:08,041 --> 00:09:09,875
I'll give up my post. 

272
00:09:10,675 --> 00:09:12,708
- You'll give up your post? / - It's not a real post but... 

273
00:09:12,708 --> 00:09:14,308
You don't have a post. 

274
00:09:14,541 --> 00:09:16,541
You can't give up your post when you don't have it. 

275
00:09:16,541 --> 00:09:18,375
It's about my pride. 

276
00:09:18,375 --> 00:09:20,775
- I'm a travel writer. / - Why are you getting so upset? 

277
00:09:21,241 --> 00:09:23,441
Many of the viewers don't seem to know me. 

278
00:09:23,608 --> 00:09:24,775
I'm a bit worried. 

279
00:09:26,408 --> 00:09:28,741
I searched fall trip on the internet 

280
00:09:28,741 --> 00:09:30,341
and it shows Fall Trip Week. 

281
00:09:30,341 --> 00:09:32,141
- Yes, there's that. / - Fall Trip Week. 

282
00:09:32,141 --> 00:09:34,208
It shows where you can go 

283
00:09:34,208 --> 00:09:36,775
and what you can do there. 

284
00:09:36,775 --> 00:09:39,341
It shows recommendations for different time periods. 

285
00:09:39,341 --> 00:09:43,175
It's easy to find information on the internet these days. 

286
00:09:43,175 --> 00:09:44,175
It's great. 

287
00:09:44,175 --> 00:09:46,041
It's easier to plan a trip these days. 

288
00:09:47,208 --> 00:09:48,875
By the way... 

289
00:09:48,875 --> 00:09:51,008
Listen. You called me... 

290
00:09:51,008 --> 00:09:52,041
- And it means you want to eat. / - Exactly. 

291
00:09:52,041 --> 00:09:53,541
- Right? / - That's it. 

292
00:09:53,541 --> 00:09:55,841
- Which province has the best food? / - Jeolla-do. 

293
00:09:55,841 --> 00:09:58,408
Right. There are a lot of cities in Jeolla-do. 

294
00:09:58,408 --> 00:10:00,541
There are a few cities I love the most among them. 

295
00:10:00,541 --> 00:10:02,608
- In Jeolla-do? / - The essence of... 

296
00:10:02,608 --> 00:10:05,875
Jeollanam-do is this city. 

297
00:10:06,075 --> 00:10:07,808
Mokpo in Jeollanam-do. 

298
00:10:07,808 --> 00:10:09,375
- Mokpo. / - Mokpo. 

299
00:10:09,941 --> 00:10:11,708
It's hard to get there. 

300
00:10:11,708 --> 00:10:13,375
- It's far away. / - Surprisingly, yes. 

301
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:15,408
There are so many delicious food in Mokpo. 

302
00:10:15,408 --> 00:10:19,275
There's a Buddhist saying, "3 steps and 1 bow." 

303
00:10:19,275 --> 00:10:20,541
It means you take a bow after three steps. 

304
00:10:20,541 --> 00:10:22,975
Here, it's "3 steps and 1 food." 

305
00:10:23,975 --> 00:10:25,508
You can find food every three steps. 

306
00:10:25,508 --> 00:10:29,208
Mokpo is a famous city but it's quite small. 

307
00:10:29,208 --> 00:10:31,708
Right in front of Mokpo Station is the old town. 

308
00:10:31,875 --> 00:10:33,108
That's what I like about Mokpo. 

309
00:10:33,108 --> 00:10:34,875
Everything is near the station. 

310
00:10:34,875 --> 00:10:36,375
The old town is right in front. 

311
00:10:36,375 --> 00:10:38,241
What do the three of us like? 

312
00:10:38,241 --> 00:10:41,908
What brings us and Sikyung together? 

313
00:10:41,908 --> 00:10:43,141
You know what it is. 

314
00:10:43,141 --> 00:10:45,408
After we drink, we don't even need to call a chauffeur. 

315
00:10:45,408 --> 00:10:47,675
- We can just walk to our hotel. / - That sounds great. 

316
00:10:47,675 --> 00:10:49,475
- It's the best. / - Sounds good. 

317
00:10:50,175 --> 00:10:51,275
Every time I watch Battle Trip, 

318
00:10:51,275 --> 00:10:52,708
I realize the team name is important. 

319
00:10:52,708 --> 00:10:53,975
- What about 45? / - 45. 

320
00:10:53,975 --> 00:10:55,708
- 45? / - Our average age is 45. 

321
00:10:57,641 --> 00:10:58,775
What about 136? 

322
00:10:58,775 --> 00:11:00,241
- 136? / - 136 doesn't sound bad either. 

323
00:11:00,408 --> 00:11:01,441
136? 

324
00:11:02,141 --> 00:11:04,908
How about something that is related to walking? 

325
00:11:04,908 --> 00:11:06,175
- Something with walking. / - I have an idea. 

326
00:11:06,175 --> 00:11:08,375
Something related to walking. 

327
00:11:08,375 --> 00:11:09,475
Nilriri Manbo. 

328
00:11:10,541 --> 00:11:12,875
Isn't that nice? Let's walk with our pedometers on. 

329
00:11:12,875 --> 00:11:15,008
Let's walk 10,000 steps in Mokpo. 

330
00:11:15,008 --> 00:11:16,475
- Eat a lot of good food. / - Yes, let's eat a lot of food. 

331
00:11:16,475 --> 00:11:17,175
That's right. 

332
00:11:17,175 --> 00:11:19,808
We won't be following a strict or busy schedule. 

333
00:11:19,808 --> 00:11:21,308
- We can stroll around there. / - Right. 

334
00:11:21,308 --> 00:11:23,708
- We can relax during the trip. / - That's right. I like it. 

335
00:11:23,708 --> 00:11:25,775
- Nilriri Manbo. / - Nilriri Manbo. 

336
00:11:25,775 --> 00:11:28,175
- I like the name. Nilriri Manbo. / - Nilriri Manbo. 

337
00:11:28,175 --> 00:11:29,708
- Okay. Okay. / - I think that's a good name. 

338
00:11:29,708 --> 00:11:31,408
If we lose, what will you do for a living? 

339
00:11:31,408 --> 00:11:33,041
- We won't lose. / - We won't lose. 

340
00:11:33,041 --> 00:11:34,441
- We're going to win. / - He's confident. 

341
00:11:34,441 --> 00:11:35,275
Everyone, please vote carefully. 

342
00:11:35,275 --> 00:11:37,141
A man's life is at stake. 

343
00:11:37,908 --> 00:11:40,241
There isn't much he can do to make a living. 

344
00:11:40,241 --> 00:11:42,041
- He doesn't have a proper post. / - I'm too old. 

345
00:11:42,041 --> 00:11:42,841
He doesn't have any post either. 

346
00:11:42,841 --> 00:11:45,441
When it comes to food in Jeollanam-do... 

347
00:11:45,441 --> 00:11:47,741

- Good restaurants sell that. / - They sell it in bottles. 

488
00:16:46,041 --> 00:16:49,208

510
00:17:29,675 --> 00:17:32,075
- I'm joking. / - Before the World Cup in 2002? 

511

514
00:17:39,741 --> 00:17:40,808
Don't do that. 

515
00:17:40,808 --> 00:17:43,008
I feel really bad because it might be true. 

516
00:17:43,008 --> 00:17:45,675
Anyway, we can only eat this in particular season. 

517
00:17:45,675 --> 00:17:46,675
Usually, during summer. 

518
00:17:46,675 --> 00:17:50,141
But here, you can eat this all the time. 

519
00:17:50,141 --> 00:17:50,975
It's convenient. 

520
00:17:50,975 --> 00:17:51,841
Here's our food. 

521
00:17:51,841 --> 00:17:55,275
(Noodles in soybean soup is served) 

522
00:17:56,341 --> 00:17:58,808
(The flavor of the soybeans will be the deciding factor) 

523
00:17:58,808 --> 00:18:00,508
- They make it from scratch. / - My goodness! 

524
00:18:00,508 --> 00:18:01,275
Can you tell it's good already? 

525
00:18:01,808 --> 00:18:03,808
How could that not be delicious? 

526
00:18:03,808 --> 00:18:05,675
- Right, it looks delicious. / - Look how creamy it is. 

527
00:18:05,675 --> 00:18:06,941
(Black soybean, $10, soybean, $8) 

528
00:18:06,941 --> 00:18:09,575
I don't see any toppings. There are no toppings. 

529
00:18:09,575 --> 00:18:10,041
No toppings. 

530
00:18:10,041 --> 00:18:11,941
It's the purity law for noodles in soybean soup. 

531
00:18:12,875 --> 00:18:14,141
How should we eat this? 

532
00:18:14,141 --> 00:18:16,475
- Here's my recommendation. / - How? 

533
00:18:16,475 --> 00:18:20,241
(How to enjoy noodles in soybean soup) 

534
00:18:20,241 --> 00:18:24,708
Carefully and with your whole heart, 

535
00:18:24,708 --> 00:18:27,041
hold the bowl with your two hands. 

536
00:18:27,041 --> 00:18:31,675
Don't apply too much or too little strength. 

537
00:18:32,108 --> 00:18:33,541
Isn't he too much? 

538
00:18:33,975 --> 00:18:35,941
I get the feeling that you're going too far with this. 

539
00:18:35,941 --> 00:18:38,275
He's a travel writer because it worked out for him. 

540
00:18:38,275 --> 00:18:40,741
- Taste the soup first. / - Okay. The soup? 

541
00:18:40,741 --> 00:18:41,941
(It's time to taste the soup) 

542

(How does noodles in black soybean soup taste?) 

543
00:18:49,441 --> 00:18:50,675
(He's expressing his approval with his eyebrows) 

544
00:18:50,675 --> 00:18:52,608
- What is it? / - Look at his eyebrows. 

545
00:18:52,608 --> 00:18:53,375
It's a genuine reaction. 

546
00:18:53,375 --> 00:18:55,308
He's putting on that scary facial expression. 

547
00:18:55,975 --> 00:18:57,475
(He smiles right away as it's delicious) 

548
00:18:57,475 --> 00:18:59,241
- Isn't this great? / - This is great. 

549
00:19:00,108 --> 00:19:01,275
It must have been rich. Was it rich? 

550
00:19:01,275 --> 00:19:03,141
- Yes, it was. / - It looks so rich. 

551
00:19:03,141 --> 00:19:04,508
I ordered the hot black soybean soup. 

552
00:19:04,508 --> 00:19:06,808
- You ordered the hot one. / - How did that taste? 

553
00:19:07,175 --> 00:19:09,408
It wasn't too heavy at all. It was savory. 

554
00:19:11,041 --> 00:19:12,341
- The thickness... / - Right. 

555
00:19:12,341 --> 00:19:15,475
- It's not watery at all. / - Right. 

556
00:19:15,475 --> 00:19:17,508
- But it's not too thick either. / - I know, right? 

557
00:19:17,508 --> 00:19:20,508
(Savory, rich and thick soybean soup) 

558
00:19:22,041 --> 00:19:24,708
- Can I have a sip of your soup? / - Yes, yes. 

559
00:19:24,708 --> 00:19:26,308
- The soybean soup. / - The soybean soup. 

560
00:19:28,775 --> 00:19:30,108
It's thin. 

561
00:19:30,408 --> 00:19:31,675
It tastes different. 

562
00:19:32,575 --> 00:19:35,241
I can taste the soybeans from the soybean soup. 

563
00:19:35,741 --> 00:19:36,541
I can taste the black soybeans 

564
00:19:36,541 --> 00:19:37,508
from the black soybean soup. 

565
00:19:37,508 --> 00:19:39,275
- This is so interesting. / - Yeah? 

566
00:19:39,841 --> 00:19:42,041
Compared to the black soybean soup... 

567
00:19:42,041 --> 00:19:44,975
- The soybean soup is lighter. / - Yes. 

568
00:19:44,975 --> 00:19:49,041
- It's closer to the one we usually have. / - Right. 

569
00:19:49,041 --> 00:19:51,541
- Exactly. / - The black soybean soup is heavier. 

570
00:19:51,541 --> 00:19:54,708
- I can only see the soup. / - Yeah. 

571
00:19:54,708 --> 00:19:58,175
Right, the soup isn't too light or heavy. 

572
00:19:58,175 --> 00:19:59,641
It has the perfect thickness. 

573
00:19:59,641 --> 00:20:01,375
It falls right in the middle. 

574
00:20:01,375 --> 00:20:03,541
- He's right. / - That's a hard thing to pull off. 

575
00:20:03,541 --> 00:20:05,041
- That's right. / - We have sugar... 

576
00:20:05,275 --> 00:20:06,275
- And salt. / - Right. 

577
00:20:06,275 --> 00:20:09,975
- In Seoul, we add a bit of salt. / - Yes. 

578
00:20:09,975 --> 00:20:11,341
Why is there sugar here? 

579
00:20:11,341 --> 00:20:14,208
A lot of people in Jeolla-do add sugar into this. 

580
00:20:14,208 --> 00:20:15,741
- Really? / - They add sugar more than salt. 

581
00:20:15,741 --> 00:20:17,741
I don't think I need to season it more. 

582
00:20:17,741 --> 00:20:19,608
I think this is already seasoned. 

583
00:20:19,608 --> 00:20:22,908
- It's slightly seasoned with salt. / - Right? 

584
00:20:22,908 --> 00:20:24,508
Depending on your preference... 

585
00:20:24,508 --> 00:20:26,608
- You can add whatever you want. / - Okay. 

586
00:20:26,608 --> 00:20:28,708
But since we're in Mokpo... 

587
00:20:28,708 --> 00:20:32,108
Why don't we try the way locals do here? 

588
00:20:32,108 --> 00:20:32,508
Add sugar? 

589
00:20:32,508 --> 00:20:33,708
Yes, sugar. 

590
00:20:33,708 --> 00:20:35,341
You can add two spoons of sugar. 

591
00:20:35,341 --> 00:20:36,708
- What? / - You can add a lot of sugar. 

592
00:20:36,708 --> 00:20:38,575
- It's better than adding a bit. / - You should add a lot. 

593
00:20:38,575 --> 00:20:40,408
- Let me just add one spoon for now. / - Sure. 

594
00:20:40,808 --> 00:20:44,341
Add the sugar as you taste the change in flavors. 

595
00:20:44,341 --> 00:20:45,875
- Look at him. He's scared. / - Is this too little? 

596
00:20:45,875 --> 00:20:47,308
- You should add more. / - The locals here... 

597
00:20:47,308 --> 00:20:48,441
- Add big spoonfuls. / - Really? 

598
00:20:48,441 --> 00:20:50,208
- Scoop up a lot. / - That's why I added more. 

599
00:20:50,208 --> 00:20:51,908
- It was good. / - Right, that looks good. 

600
00:20:52,775 --> 00:20:54,108
(Sprinkle a bit of sugar on top) 

601
00:20:54,108 --> 00:20:56,375
(Sprinkle a lot of sugar on top) 

602
00:20:57,541 --> 00:20:58,675
(Mix the sugar in) 

603
00:20:58,675 --> 00:21:00,308
- It looks delicious. / - That's really delicious. 

604
00:21:00,308 --> 00:21:01,841
- This clip is like a work of art. / - That's really good. 

605
00:21:01,841 --> 00:21:04,308
- I'm hungry. / - The sweetness wakes you up. 

606
00:21:04,441 --> 00:21:05,775
- My gosh, look at that. / - It was my first time... 

607
00:21:05,775 --> 00:21:07,075
To have noodles in soybean soup for breakfast. 

608
00:21:07,075 --> 00:21:08,975
- Yes. / - But it was good. 

609
00:21:08,975 --> 00:21:10,641
It's really thick. 

610
00:21:12,275 --> 00:21:13,741
- It was good. / - Gosh. 

611
00:21:13,741 --> 00:21:15,275
(Now they try the noodles) 

612
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:18,708
(It tastes so good, they hum) 

613
00:21:18,775 --> 00:21:20,675
It's interesting. It became more delicious. 

614
00:21:20,675 --> 00:21:22,841
It tastes more delicious. It's interesting. 

615
00:21:23,441 --> 00:21:25,275
(Yum) 

616
00:21:25,575 --> 00:21:27,241
(Bursts out laughing) 

617
00:21:27,241 --> 00:21:29,341
- I don't know if I should say this. / - It's delicious. 

618
00:21:29,575 --> 00:21:31,241
Noodles in soybean soup with sugar 

619
00:21:31,241 --> 00:21:33,075
tastes like noodles in red bean soup. 

620
00:21:33,741 --> 00:21:34,541
It does. 

621
00:21:35,475 --> 00:21:35,908
It really does. 

622
00:21:35,908 --> 00:21:37,808
- You're right. / - Because red bean is sweet. 

623
00:21:37,808 --> 00:21:38,808
- That's right. / - Yes. 

624
00:21:38,808 --> 00:21:40,208
It was similar but more savory. 

625
00:21:40,208 --> 00:21:43,241
- That's why people put sugar in it. / - Of course. 

626
00:21:43,241 --> 00:21:45,541
(Noodles in soybean soup is more flavorful with sugar) 

627
00:21:45,841 --> 00:21:47,975
This noodles are really interesting too. 

628
00:21:47,975 --> 00:21:49,441
- Aren't they? / - They are. 

629
00:21:49,441 --> 00:21:51,775
They aren't thin noodles or chewy noodles. 

630
00:21:51,775 --> 00:21:54,008
- They're somewhere between. / - Yeah. 

631
00:21:54,008 --> 00:21:56,541
- It's chewy. / - Exactly. 

632
00:21:56,975 --> 00:22:01,308
They're thin but they don't plop down. 

633
00:22:01,308 --> 00:22:04,708
The noodles are thinner than udon noodles. 

634
00:22:04,708 --> 00:22:06,875
- They're thin but firm. / - They're chewy. 

635
00:22:06,875 --> 00:22:09,041
People will think it's cream pasta. 

636
00:22:09,041 --> 00:22:11,775
- Carbonara. / - You're right. 

637
00:22:12,108 --> 00:22:14,341
Usually they pour soybean soup over the noodles. 

638
00:22:14,341 --> 00:22:16,375
- That's the usual feeling. / - Yes. 

639
00:22:16,375 --> 00:22:16,975
But with this one, 

640
00:22:16,975 --> 00:22:19,008
it's as if noodles were added to the soup. 

641
00:22:20,841 --> 00:22:22,175
More than anything. 

642
00:22:22,908 --> 00:22:25,075
I found out that noodles in soybean soup... 

643
00:22:25,075 --> 00:22:26,975
- Is good for breakfast. / - Yeah. 

644
00:22:26,975 --> 00:22:30,008
I was worried about eating this as breakfast. 

645
00:22:30,441 --> 00:22:31,608
But it's so good. 

646
00:22:33,475 --> 00:22:38,808
(They start the day with hearty breakfast) 

647
00:22:39,275 --> 00:22:42,375
(It looks like they might eat the bowls too) 

648
00:22:42,375 --> 00:22:45,275
- It's good without seasoning it? / - Yes, it is. 

649
00:22:45,275 --> 00:22:47,375
- It's already seasoned slightly. / - I see. 

650
00:22:47,841 --> 00:22:48,975
That looks good. 

651
00:22:48,975 --> 00:22:50,941
Would you order warm noodle soup again? 

652
00:22:50,941 --> 00:22:53,175
- Yes, I would. / - Really? 

653
00:22:53,175 --> 00:22:55,575
- I'm really curious. / - Is it in Seoul? 

654
00:22:55,575 --> 00:22:57,708
- I've never seen it. / - I've never tried it before. 

655
00:22:58,541 --> 00:23:03,675
(Where are they off to next in Mokpo?) 

656
00:23:03,875 --> 00:23:06,775
Now that we had a meal, we'll go for a dessert. 

657
00:23:07,541 --> 00:23:08,741
We'll have rice cake. 

658
00:23:08,741 --> 00:23:09,575
Rice cake? 

659
00:23:10,075 --> 00:23:12,608
- Rice cake for dessert? / - That's wrong. 

660
00:23:12,608 --> 00:23:14,508
It's a snack stand to be exact. 

661
00:23:14,508 --> 00:23:16,108
- A snack stand? / - Yes. 

662
00:23:16,841 --> 00:23:19,208
I think Junghun eats a lot. 

663
00:23:19,208 --> 00:23:20,541
There are a lot of rice cake cafes these days. 

664
00:23:20,541 --> 00:23:22,141
You had just had flour. Now you're having rice cake. 

665
00:23:22,141 --> 00:23:23,941
That place is only 500m away. 

666
00:23:23,941 --> 00:23:26,541
We had a hard time leaving Mokpo Station. 

667
00:23:27,108 --> 00:23:29,941
The second place is only 500m away 

668
00:23:29,941 --> 00:23:31,375
from Mokpo Station. 

669
00:23:31,375 --> 00:23:34,108
- So it's only 200m away from here. / - About 220m. 

670
00:23:34,108 --> 00:23:35,141
From the noodles in soybean soup place. 

671
00:23:35,141 --> 00:23:36,175
(They're only 200m apart) 

672
00:23:40,708 --> 00:23:43,375
We're still near Mokpo Station. 

673
00:23:43,375 --> 00:23:45,241
I can see Mokpo Station. 

674
00:23:45,241 --> 00:23:46,708
Mokpo Station right there. 

675
00:23:46,708 --> 00:23:47,941
(They're circling around Mokpo Station) 

676
00:23:47,941 --> 00:23:49,575
We're within 200m. 

677
00:23:49,575 --> 00:23:50,975
We got  here 2 hours ago but 

678
00:23:50,975 --> 00:23:52,641
we're still near Mokpo Station. 

679
00:23:52,641 --> 00:23:54,075
Our goal today is... 

680
00:23:54,408 --> 00:23:56,875
To get out of Mokpo Station. 

681
00:23:57,741 --> 00:24:00,375
- All three of them love talking. / - Yes. 

682
00:24:00,975 --> 00:24:02,208
That's very close. 

683
00:24:02,208 --> 00:24:03,941
We're here. 

684
00:24:03,941 --> 00:24:05,175
- What? / - We're here. 

685
00:24:05,175 --> 00:24:06,475
- Is this it? / - This is the place. 

686
00:24:06,741 --> 00:24:08,041
- This is it. / - Where? 

687
00:24:08,041 --> 00:24:09,275
- Mugwort rice cake. / - Mugwort rice cake. 

688
00:24:09,275 --> 00:24:12,008
This is what we'll have today. 

689
00:24:12,008 --> 00:24:12,841
Mugwort rice cake. 

690
00:24:13,675 --> 00:24:15,141
- Mugwort rice cake? / - Yes. 

691
00:24:15,141 --> 00:24:16,241
What is mugwort rice cake? 

692
00:24:16,241 --> 00:24:17,441
You'll be surprised. 

693
00:24:17,441 --> 00:24:19,408
- I've never seen such color. / - What's that? 

694
00:24:19,408 --> 00:24:22,341
You put red bean paste on mugwort rice cake. 

695
00:24:22,341 --> 00:24:24,975
- Yes. / - Then you pour rice syrup on top. 

696
00:24:24,975 --> 00:24:26,275
- Pour over it? / - Yes. 

697
00:24:26,275 --> 00:24:28,275
It like what's inside is applied on the outside. 

698
00:24:28,275 --> 00:24:30,908
Exactly. It has a filling and has stuff outside. 

699
00:24:30,908 --> 00:24:33,041
- What is that? / - That was good. 

700
00:24:33,041 --> 00:24:34,108
(Mugwort rice cake, $5) 

701
00:24:35,008 --> 00:24:36,141
Here it is. 

702
00:24:37,041 --> 00:24:38,408
- Hello. / - Hello. 

703
00:24:38,408 --> 00:24:39,575
- Thank you. / - It's pretty. 

704
00:24:39,575 --> 00:24:41,008
(Excited) 

705
00:24:41,008 --> 00:24:42,041
It's pretty. 

706
00:24:42,041 --> 00:24:43,508
So this is mugwort rice cake. 

707
00:24:44,075 --> 00:24:46,508
- Doesn't it look pretty? / - Yes. 

708
00:24:46,508 --> 00:24:49,541
It's unique. I've never seen something like this. 

709
00:24:49,541 --> 00:24:51,141
Those who graduated from Mokpo Girls High School 

710
00:24:51,141 --> 00:24:52,908
still come back for this. 

711
00:24:53,208 --> 00:24:54,741
- Looks delicious. / - Sook, isn't that what you like? 

712
00:24:54,741 --> 00:24:55,908
I love that. 

713
00:24:55,908 --> 00:24:57,975
- I can eat 100 of them. / - But doesn't it... 

714
00:24:57,975 --> 00:25:00,108
- Look like fish cake? / - Fish cake? 

715
00:25:00,108 --> 00:25:02,275
They have regular rice cake too. 

716
00:25:02,275 --> 00:25:04,041
Anyway, Mokpo citizens love this 

717
00:25:04,041 --> 00:25:06,041
and this has been their favorite snack for a long time. 

718
00:25:06,041 --> 00:25:08,308
For example, Tongyeong is famous for honey bread. 

719
00:25:08,308 --> 00:25:10,708
- Mokpo is famous for this. / - Exactly. 

720
00:25:10,708 --> 00:25:12,475
- Let's eat. / - Go ahead. 

721
00:25:13,241 --> 00:25:14,675
This looks... 

722
00:25:14,675 --> 00:25:15,841
(Looks very sweet) 

723
00:25:15,841 --> 00:25:17,875
- Extremely sweet. / - Yes. 

724
00:25:17,875 --> 00:25:19,775
- It does. / - No. 

725
00:25:19,775 --> 00:25:21,441
- It's not that sweet. / - Is this rice syrup? 

726
00:25:21,441 --> 00:25:22,108
Yes, it is. 

727
00:25:22,675 --> 00:25:25,508
(He nervously takes a bite) 

728
00:25:25,508 --> 00:25:26,608
It's rice syrup. 

729
00:25:26,608 --> 00:25:27,675
(Yum) 

730
00:25:28,775 --> 00:25:30,841
(He takes a bite too) 

731
00:25:30,841 --> 00:25:31,875
It looks good. 

732
00:25:31,875 --> 00:25:33,941
(His face tells us that he's satisfied) 

733
00:25:34,208 --> 00:25:35,475
I have a female high schooler's palette. 

734
00:25:36,208 --> 00:25:38,175
- This is so good. / - I knew you'd like it. 

735
00:25:38,175 --> 00:25:39,808
Hyunbo has a female high schooler's taste. 

736
00:25:40,208 --> 00:25:42,208
Every female high school student in Mokpo 

737
00:25:42,208 --> 00:25:43,308
knows this place. 

738
00:25:43,308 --> 00:25:45,041
It's a really old snack stand. 

739
00:25:45,041 --> 00:25:46,808
You have a female high schooler's sensitivity. 

740
00:25:48,075 --> 00:25:49,175
Yes, I have. 

741
00:25:49,175 --> 00:25:50,841
It can't be clearly defined. 

742
00:25:51,108 --> 00:25:55,008
There's no line between mugwort rice cake 

743
00:25:55,008 --> 00:25:56,608
and red bean paste. 

744
00:25:56,608 --> 00:25:59,408
They kind of seem mixed. 

745
00:25:59,408 --> 00:26:01,808
So when you put it in your mouth, 

746
00:26:01,808 --> 00:26:03,341
the ingredients mix. 

747
00:26:03,341 --> 00:26:04,708
It's soft and moist. 

748
00:26:04,941 --> 00:26:07,008
It's perfect for dessert. 

749
00:26:07,008 --> 00:26:08,308
So we ate a lot of it. 

750
00:26:08,308 --> 00:26:09,475
(Simple appearance, amazing taste) 

751
00:26:09,475 --> 00:26:11,808
You can't use your hands. 

752
00:26:11,808 --> 00:26:13,675
You need a spoon because of the syrup. 

753
00:26:13,675 --> 00:26:14,875
- Yes. / - That's right. 

754
00:26:15,308 --> 00:26:17,375
You need to use a spoon because of the syrup, 

755
00:26:17,375 --> 00:26:20,008
so they called it rice cake for noblemen. 

756
00:26:21,108 --> 00:26:22,608
When you said we were going to 

757
00:26:22,608 --> 00:26:24,675
have rice cake for dessert... 

758
00:26:25,008 --> 00:26:26,508
I thought, "But I'm full." 

759
00:26:26,508 --> 00:26:28,108
- But it's satisfying. / - Yes. 

760
00:26:28,108 --> 00:26:28,808
It's good. 

761
00:26:28,808 --> 00:26:32,875
If it was regular rice cake without the syrup, 

762
00:26:32,875 --> 00:26:34,208
it would've been too much. 

763
00:26:34,208 --> 00:26:37,541
Exactly, because it'd stick to your mouth. 

764
00:26:37,541 --> 00:26:38,775
How? 

765
00:26:38,775 --> 00:26:40,608
(Like this) 

766
00:26:40,908 --> 00:26:42,941
- Did you like it? / - How much was it? 

767
00:26:42,941 --> 00:26:45,341
- $5. / - Is that it? 

768
00:26:45,341 --> 00:26:47,575
Sir, please order one more. 

769
00:26:47,575 --> 00:26:48,541
- One more? / - More? 

770
00:26:48,541 --> 00:26:49,941
- What? / - It was so good. 

771
00:26:49,941 --> 00:26:50,808
You have other things to eat though. 

772
00:26:50,808 --> 00:26:53,241
I said, "Who eats rice cake for dessert?" at first. 

773
00:26:53,241 --> 00:26:54,441
But I ordered one more. 

774
00:26:54,441 --> 00:26:55,941
You can eat a lot of it because 

775
00:26:55,941 --> 00:26:58,608
it's not that sweet even with all that syrup. 

776
00:26:58,608 --> 00:26:59,841
- Really? / - It's not that sweet. 

777
00:26:59,841 --> 00:27:01,708
- I actually don't like sweet stuff. / - Right. 

778
00:27:01,708 --> 00:27:02,675
Still it was so good. 

779
00:27:02,675 --> 00:27:05,008
- I couldn't stop eating. / - Their syrup must be good. 

780
00:27:05,008 --> 00:27:06,141
- Yes. / - That's right. 

781
00:27:06,141 --> 00:27:07,508
(Yummy and sweet) 

782
00:27:08,008 --> 00:27:12,008
(Junghun's dessert is a success) 

783
00:27:12,008 --> 00:27:15,775
It's hard to make mugwort rice cake. 

784
00:27:15,775 --> 00:27:18,608
So $5 isn't very expensive. 

785
00:27:18,608 --> 00:27:21,308
You can have rice cake very elegantly. 

786
00:27:21,675 --> 00:27:23,208
What's next? 

787
00:27:23,908 --> 00:27:25,008
It's a hidden point. 

788
00:27:25,408 --> 00:27:26,708
- What? / - A hidden point? 

789
00:27:26,708 --> 00:27:29,041
Third place. A hidden card. 

790
00:27:29,041 --> 00:27:32,041
I'll take you to a cafe 

791
00:27:32,041 --> 00:27:34,808
for a late morning coffee. 

792
00:27:34,808 --> 00:27:37,375
- Are we going to a franchised cafe? / - Gosh. 

793
00:27:37,675 --> 00:27:39,675
Stop that nonsense. 

794
00:27:40,041 --> 00:27:43,241
Alright. I wouldn't take you to a franchise. 

795
00:27:43,241 --> 00:27:44,208
Right. 

796
00:27:44,208 --> 00:27:45,208
Can I look forward to it? 

797
00:27:45,208 --> 00:27:46,408
It's a beautiful place. 

798
00:27:46,408 --> 00:27:47,508
How far? 

799
00:27:47,508 --> 00:27:48,808
About 890m. 

800
00:27:48,808 --> 00:27:50,241
Can we get away from Mokpo Station? 

801
00:27:51,008 --> 00:27:52,908
- Yes, we can get away. / - That's important. 

802
00:27:52,908 --> 00:27:54,608
We can't see Mokpo Station from there. 

803
00:27:54,608 --> 00:27:56,308
- You can't see it. / - Is that right? 

804
00:27:57,908 --> 00:28:00,341
The weather is amazing all of a sudden. 

805
00:28:00,708 --> 00:28:02,008
Look at that. 

806
00:28:02,008 --> 00:28:03,975
- The sky is blue. / - It's nice. 

807
00:28:03,975 --> 00:28:05,075
It got cleared up. 

808
00:28:05,075 --> 00:28:08,575
- We'll start the real Mokpo trip. / - Right. 

809
00:28:08,575 --> 00:28:11,108
(13 minutes from the snack stand to the cafe) 

810
00:28:11,108 --> 00:28:12,675
But this neighborhood... 

811
00:28:12,675 --> 00:28:14,575
- Has a different atmosphere. / - Yes. 

812
00:28:14,575 --> 00:28:18,375
Actually, this place is the main area 

813
00:28:18,375 --> 00:28:20,308
for the old Mokpo walking tour. 

814
00:28:20,308 --> 00:28:22,175
What you see on my right is... 

815
00:28:22,675 --> 00:28:24,841
Mokpo Modern History Museum 2. 

816
00:28:25,108 --> 00:28:26,875
- It's an old building. / - Yes. 

817
00:28:26,875 --> 00:28:29,041
(Mokpo Modern History Museum) 

818
00:28:29,041 --> 00:28:29,941
It was Oriental Development Company. 

819
00:28:30,341 --> 00:28:33,175
There are buildings left from Japanese colonial-era. 

820
00:28:33,175 --> 00:28:35,075
- It's like a film set. / - There are inns too. 

821
00:28:35,075 --> 00:28:37,475
Mokpo has the most Japanese colonial-era buildings. 

822
00:28:38,041 --> 00:28:39,575
They kept the hurtful memory. 

823
00:28:39,575 --> 00:28:41,041
They turned it into Mokpo Modern History Museum. 

824
00:28:41,041 --> 00:28:41,875
That's right. 

825
00:28:41,875 --> 00:28:44,575
I mentioned it earlier. What is this called again? 

826
00:28:44,575 --> 00:28:45,841
- Dark tourism. / - Dark tourism. 

827
00:28:45,841 --> 00:28:48,775
It's also called black tourism or grief tourism. 

828
00:28:48,775 --> 00:28:51,675
To remind us so that we don't repeat the sad history. 

829
00:28:51,675 --> 00:28:54,575
Mokpo needs questions and answers 

830
00:28:54,575 --> 00:28:57,608
that are related to history. 

831
00:28:57,608 --> 00:28:59,408
- It has a historical background. / - It's meaningful. 

832
00:28:59,408 --> 00:29:02,341
- We need to ask questions. / - Yes. 

833
00:29:04,308 --> 00:29:09,175
The cafe we're going to was an old Japanese house 

834
00:29:09,175 --> 00:29:12,708
that was built during the colonial era. 

835
00:29:13,008 --> 00:29:14,841
- Is that where we're going? / - Let's go. 

836
00:29:15,208 --> 00:29:16,675
- Is it here? / - Yes. 

837
00:29:16,675 --> 00:29:17,375
(Nilriri Manbo Tour's hidden card) 

838
00:29:17,375 --> 00:29:19,975
(Jeoksan Gaok cafe) 

839
00:29:19,975 --> 00:29:21,608
- Jeoksan. / - Jeoksan Gaok cafe. 

840
00:29:21,608 --> 00:29:25,908
Houses that were built and resided by Japanese 

841
00:29:25,908 --> 00:29:28,241
during the colonial era are called Jeoksan Gaok. 

842
00:29:28,241 --> 00:29:30,408
Any houses or property is called Jeoksan. 

843
00:29:30,408 --> 00:29:32,275
Which literally means enemy property. 

844
00:29:32,275 --> 00:29:33,641
Enemy property. 

845
00:29:33,641 --> 00:29:36,008
Jeoksan means enemy property. 

846
00:29:36,008 --> 00:29:37,275
(Houses owned by Japanese are called Jeoksan) 

847
00:29:37,275 --> 00:29:38,975
- That must feel weird. / - Yes. 

848
00:29:38,975 --> 00:29:40,075
I felt strange. 

849
00:29:40,075 --> 00:29:43,508
If we didn't know about history, 

850
00:29:43,508 --> 00:29:46,008
we would've just said, "That's pretty. That's different." 

851
00:29:46,008 --> 00:29:47,708
But knowing the history and background... 

852
00:29:47,708 --> 00:29:50,941
- Made me feel sad. / - Right. 

853
00:29:50,941 --> 00:29:52,675
- Because it's a painful history. / - Yes. 

854
00:29:52,675 --> 00:29:54,241
(Jeoksan Gaok cafe) 

855
00:29:54,241 --> 00:29:55,741
(An old Japanese house turned into a cafe) 

856
00:29:55,741 --> 00:29:58,841
They decorated the interior very well. 

857
00:29:58,841 --> 00:29:59,875
(This house belonged to a Japanese merchant) 

858
00:29:59,875 --> 00:30:04,375
They have old furniture and handmade linen items. 

859
00:30:04,375 --> 00:30:06,441
So it gives off foreign atmosphere. 

860
00:30:06,441 --> 00:30:09,375
(Jeoksan Gaok cafe is open from 11 a.m. to 10 p.m.) 

861
00:30:09,375 --> 00:30:12,141
(If you order a drink, you can use the dessert buffet) 

862
00:30:14,508 --> 00:30:15,975
Look at this. They haven't changed anything. 

863
00:30:15,975 --> 00:30:18,441
- Yeah. / - It even creaks. 

864
00:30:18,441 --> 00:30:19,841
That goes upstairs. 

865
00:30:19,841 --> 00:30:24,608
It's a sad history but it's good to remember it. 

866
00:30:24,608 --> 00:30:27,241
- Of course. We need to study it. / - It's good. 

867
00:30:30,841 --> 00:30:32,275
It's a very... 

868
00:30:32,475 --> 00:30:33,675
Different combination. 

869
00:30:33,675 --> 00:30:39,241
Outside is very traditional Japanese style. 

870
00:30:39,241 --> 00:30:42,441
(Unlike the traditional Japanese style exterior) 

871
00:30:42,441 --> 00:30:44,575
It's not just Japanese style. 

872
00:30:44,575 --> 00:30:46,508
Actually, the interior is very Western. 

873
00:30:46,508 --> 00:30:48,608
- It's European. / - Yes, it's a mix. 

874
00:30:49,208 --> 00:30:51,041
It's a mix of Western and Eastern styles. 

875
00:30:52,408 --> 00:30:55,141
It's very nicely decorated. 

876
00:30:55,141 --> 00:30:58,208
- But we can't just say it's pretty. / - Right. 

877
00:30:58,208 --> 00:31:02,108
- It's an odd feeling. / - It is. 

878
00:31:02,441 --> 00:31:04,908
In any case... 

879
00:31:04,908 --> 00:31:07,408
Unfortunately, for most of the cases, 

880
00:31:07,408 --> 00:31:10,108
people were busy trying to demolish... 

881
00:31:10,108 --> 00:31:11,741
- This style of building. / - Yes. 

882
00:31:11,741 --> 00:31:14,541
Well, it's probably because 

883
00:31:14,541 --> 00:31:16,275
the areas didn't get developed. 

884
00:31:16,275 --> 00:31:17,608
Whatever the reason may be... 

885
00:31:18,175 --> 00:31:19,675
These houses in Gunsan and Mokpo 

886
00:31:19,675 --> 00:31:21,008
are well-preserved. 

887
00:31:21,008 --> 00:31:22,341
As I mentioned earlier, 

888
00:31:22,341 --> 00:31:24,441
these cities present such high values 

889
00:31:24,441 --> 00:31:27,041
for modern cultural heritage. 

890
00:31:27,675 --> 00:31:29,775
My explanations are as good as Choi Taeseong. 

891
00:31:30,308 --> 00:31:31,908
- You're complimenting about yourself? / - Yes. 

892
00:31:32,375 --> 00:31:34,841
- Yours wasn't as good. / - Come on. Why don't you... 

893
00:31:34,841 --> 00:31:37,408
- Compliment me on my work? / - Alright. 

894
00:31:38,775 --> 00:31:45,541
(Nilriri Manbo Tour decided to take a short break) 

895
00:31:45,541 --> 00:31:47,141
- Thank you. / - Thank you. 

896
00:31:47,141 --> 00:31:48,641
Thank you. 

897
00:31:48,641 --> 00:31:51,108
- All three of them calmed down. / - Thank you. 

898
00:31:51,108 --> 00:31:52,508
- There's a balcony? / - My gosh. 

899
00:31:53,775 --> 00:31:55,675
- Isn't this a beautiful house? / - It's very beautiful. 

900
00:31:56,141 --> 00:31:58,041
If you want to live here, don't go. Live here. 

901
00:31:58,041 --> 00:31:59,908
(If you think the house is pretty, live here) 

902
00:32:00,708 --> 00:32:02,075
- The cafe was awesome. / - It was great. 

903
00:32:02,075 --> 00:32:04,108
- Drinking coffee outdoors is great. / - So amazing. 

904
00:32:04,108 --> 00:32:06,841
- It's popular among cafe-goers. / - That's true. 

905
00:32:07,441 --> 00:32:09,141
The breeze is so nice. 

906
00:32:09,141 --> 00:32:10,675
- The sunshine is great too. / - Right? 

907
00:32:11,341 --> 00:32:13,041
- All of us got quiet. / - I see. 

908
00:32:13,541 --> 00:32:15,508
- That was my favorite part. / - I agree. 

909
00:32:16,908 --> 00:32:20,275
(What is their next destination?) 

910
00:32:22,041 --> 00:32:24,308
Is our next stop a hidden card or not? 

911
00:32:25,275 --> 00:32:26,575
Our next destination. 

912
00:32:26,575 --> 00:32:27,708
That place... 

913
00:32:29,608 --> 00:32:30,675
Is a hidden card. 

914
00:32:31,441 --> 00:32:33,208
If you keep that up, we can't win this battle. 

915
00:32:35,008 --> 00:32:35,908
You say all of our destinations are hidden cards. 

916
00:32:35,908 --> 00:32:37,075
What is this? 

917
00:32:37,075 --> 00:32:39,675
If you continue this, they won't be our hidden cards. 

918
00:32:39,675 --> 00:32:40,808
Yeah. 

919
00:32:40,808 --> 00:32:41,975
What is this? 

920
00:32:41,975 --> 00:32:43,708
You say every place is a hidden card. 

921
00:32:43,708 --> 00:32:45,841
- If you continue to be like this, I might hide. / - What? 

922
00:32:46,108 --> 00:32:48,041
- I will hide. / - That'd be a real hidden card. 

923
00:32:48,475 --> 00:32:49,441
I can go into hiding, you know. 

924
00:32:49,441 --> 00:32:51,008
That would be our hidden card? 

925
00:32:51,008 --> 00:32:52,875
If you hide, we'll use internet. 

926
00:32:52,875 --> 00:32:54,908
(Where is their next destination?) 

927
00:32:56,141 --> 00:32:59,475
(14 minutes on foot from the cafe to the alley) 

928
00:32:59,475 --> 00:33:01,241
- Are you going to eat more? / - No, no. 

929
00:33:02,075 --> 00:33:03,575
(They set out to feel the ocean with the fall breeze) 

930
00:33:03,575 --> 00:33:04,841
We went for a walk. 

931
00:33:04,841 --> 00:33:05,708
(Before going to the alley) 

932
00:33:05,708 --> 00:33:10,575
Our trip was about walking and eating. 

933
00:33:12,208 --> 00:33:14,708
- Isn't this your first time here? / - Yes. 

934
00:33:14,941 --> 00:33:15,941
Right here. 

935
00:33:15,941 --> 00:33:18,275
- The coastal walk. / - The coastal walk. 

936
00:33:18,275 --> 00:33:20,808
It's my first time seeing the ocean 

937
00:33:20,808 --> 00:33:22,175
after getting off the station. 

938
00:33:22,175 --> 00:33:23,441
How many hours has it been? 

939
00:33:23,808 --> 00:33:26,308
I finally feel like I'm in Mokpo now that I'm here. 

940
00:33:26,308 --> 00:33:28,741
- This is a nice path to walk on. / - Right. 

941
00:33:28,741 --> 00:33:30,641
- That was great. / - Tides must come in all the way. 

942
00:33:30,641 --> 00:33:32,941
They made a nice trail to walk. 

943
00:33:33,408 --> 00:33:35,941
- Can you walk along the coast? / - Yes. 

944
00:33:35,941 --> 00:33:38,975
(This is Nilriri Manbo Tour's destination) 

945
00:33:39,108 --> 00:33:41,475
(Nilriri Manbo Tour's hidden card) 

946
00:33:41,475 --> 00:33:46,375
(The alley) 

947
00:33:46,908 --> 00:33:49,175
(This place got popular due to the movie, "1987") 

948
00:33:49,175 --> 00:33:50,508
- Really? / - I saw that movie. 

949
00:33:50,508 --> 00:33:52,108
- Was that Yoo Haijin's house? / - That's right. 

950
00:33:52,108 --> 00:33:53,708
- That was Kim Taeri's house. / - In the movie. 

951
00:33:55,141 --> 00:33:57,241
- Yes, I saw that. / - That neighborhood is so pretty. 

952
00:33:57,241 --> 00:33:59,341
- The house Gang Dongwon visited. / - Yes! 

953
00:33:59,641 --> 00:34:01,641
This place is near Seosan-dong and Ongeum-dong. 

954
00:34:01,641 --> 00:34:03,541
This neighborhood is so pretty. 

955
00:34:03,541 --> 00:34:08,041
This reminds me Yeonhui-dong. 

956
00:34:08,041 --> 00:34:10,608
- That's right. / - The houses are similar. 

957
00:34:10,608 --> 00:34:12,075
This is the real spot, actually. 

958
00:34:12,508 --> 00:34:15,008
- It's near Yonsei University. / - That's right. 

959
00:34:15,008 --> 00:34:17,508
- The atmosphere is similar. / - Right. 

960
00:34:17,508 --> 00:34:19,975
- I didn't know. / - The moment he saw this area... 

961
00:34:19,975 --> 00:34:22,541
- He said two areas looked similar. / - Yes. 

962
00:34:22,875 --> 00:34:24,608
The scriptwriter for the movie 

963
00:34:24,608 --> 00:34:26,041
stumbled upon this neighborhood. 

964
00:34:26,041 --> 00:34:27,575
That's how this place ended up in the movie. 

965
00:34:27,575 --> 00:34:30,175
- What a beautiful neighborhood. / - Sihwa alley. 

966
00:34:30,175 --> 00:34:32,475
It's named "Sihwa" because it has poems and art. 

967
00:34:32,475 --> 00:34:33,975
Is that so? 

968
00:34:33,975 --> 00:34:37,008
- Can you see the end of the road? / - Yes. 

969
00:34:37,008 --> 00:34:38,841
- Can you see a small store? / - Yes. 

970
00:34:38,841 --> 00:34:40,608
- I see. Yeonhui's Store. / - You can see it, right? 

971
00:34:40,608 --> 00:34:42,175
That was in the movie, "1987." 

972
00:34:42,841 --> 00:34:44,008
That's the place. 

973
00:34:44,008 --> 00:34:45,241
It says so right there. 

974
00:34:45,541 --> 00:34:47,241
- Right on the storefront sign. / - That's right. 

975
00:34:47,241 --> 00:34:49,808
"Cigarettes, popsicles, liquor." 

976
00:34:50,308 --> 00:34:52,108
The very look of it looks so old-fashioned. 

977
00:34:52,541 --> 00:34:53,875
I love those three things. 

978
00:34:54,141 --> 00:34:56,508
(Cigarettes, popsicles, liquor) 

979
00:34:58,008 --> 00:34:59,941
- Do you want to go inside? / - Should we? 

980
00:34:59,941 --> 00:35:01,341
This is really fun. 

981
00:35:03,941 --> 00:35:08,808
(It's a space set up with things from the past) 

982
00:35:08,808 --> 00:35:11,541
- It's set up like the old days. / - My gosh. 

983
00:35:11,541 --> 00:35:13,808
- You're right. / - Juice jars from back in the days. 

984
00:35:13,808 --> 00:35:15,908
- It's hard to find those. / - Isn't this awesome? 

985
00:35:15,908 --> 00:35:18,975
- I can't find those juice jars anymore. / - Yeah. 

986
00:35:18,975 --> 00:35:21,741
- Everyone had one in their fridge. / - In the summer. 

987
00:35:21,741 --> 00:35:23,341
- By the way... / - Stickers from the old days. 

988
00:35:23,741 --> 00:35:25,375
Do you remember this coin bank? 

989
00:35:25,375 --> 00:35:26,941
- I see. / - I used to have one of those. 

990
00:35:27,475 --> 00:35:28,041
The coin bank. 

991
00:35:28,041 --> 00:35:30,308
(A walk down memory lane while looking around) 

992
00:35:33,041 --> 00:35:34,341
When we were young, 

993
00:35:34,341 --> 00:35:36,575
we had this lunchbox with a spoon inside... 

994
00:35:36,575 --> 00:35:39,241
- And put it in our backpacks. / - Right. 

995
00:35:39,241 --> 00:35:40,375
When we ran... 

996
00:35:40,375 --> 00:35:42,375
- It used to make a rattling sound. / - Yeah. 

997
00:35:42,375 --> 00:35:44,641
Usually, moms used to pack... 

998
00:35:44,641 --> 00:35:46,675
- Rice and side dishes in this box. / - Exactly. 

999
00:35:46,675 --> 00:35:48,408
- I had a fried egg on the bottom. / - Right. 

1000
00:35:48,408 --> 00:35:50,775
I put my fried egg on top of rice. I put it on top. 

1001
00:35:51,075 --> 00:35:53,175
- I couldn't do that. / - He's so odd. 

1002
00:35:53,175 --> 00:35:54,475
Gosh, so nostalgic. 

1003
00:35:56,275 --> 00:35:58,208
It's near Seosan-dong and Ongeum-dong. 

1004
00:35:58,208 --> 00:35:59,908
Actually, it's a fishing village. 

1005
00:35:59,908 --> 00:36:01,741
It's a fishing village on the hill. 

1006
00:36:01,741 --> 00:36:02,708
How should I put it? 

1007
00:36:02,708 --> 00:36:06,108
This is the authentic scenery you can see in Mokpo. 

1008
00:36:06,108 --> 00:36:06,941
If you want to see this scenery, 

1009
00:36:06,941 --> 00:36:08,175
you have to come to this old town. 

1010
00:36:08,175 --> 00:36:09,808
But after the movie, "1987," 

1011
00:36:09,808 --> 00:36:12,641
this village started to stand out more. 

1012
00:36:12,641 --> 00:36:13,941
(You can rent old school uniforms and other props) 

1013
00:36:14,341 --> 00:36:16,908
By the way, the uniforms... 

1014
00:36:16,908 --> 00:36:19,041
I just looked at them. 

1015
00:36:19,575 --> 00:36:21,875
- They look really small. / - They are small. 

1016
00:36:21,875 --> 00:36:23,508
They are tiny. Do you have bigger uniforms? 

1017
00:36:23,508 --> 00:36:25,708
- In bigger sizes? / - No uniforms here will fit you. 

1018
00:36:28,475 --> 00:36:31,708
(School uniforms that remind us of "Friend") 

1019
00:36:31,708 --> 00:36:33,408
"Friend." That movie was really fun. 

1020
00:36:33,408 --> 00:36:35,541
("Mokpo Friends") 

1021
00:36:37,241 --> 00:36:38,375
I knew that I was pushing it. 

1022
00:36:38,375 --> 00:36:39,441
I think you went too far. 

1023
00:36:39,441 --> 00:36:41,341
I knew it. The actor is the best at this. 

1024
00:36:41,341 --> 00:36:42,341
He was good. He was the best. 

1025
00:36:42,341 --> 00:36:43,375
Only actors can pull it off. 

1026
00:36:44,308 --> 00:36:46,141
- He looks awkward. / - He looks slightly awkward. 

1027
00:36:46,408 --> 00:36:49,108
(3 friends show up in Mokpo) 

1028
00:36:49,675 --> 00:36:53,575
(The journey is like traveling back in time) 

1029
00:36:53,975 --> 00:36:55,908
(Showing in theaters) 

1030
00:36:55,908 --> 00:36:57,775
(The end) 

1031
00:37:01,641 --> 00:37:03,675
I want to see the three of you on "Gag Concert." 

1032
00:37:03,675 --> 00:37:04,875
(The trio is wanted on "Gag Concert") 

1033
00:37:04,875 --> 00:37:07,141
- They make the perfect team. / - Three Stooges. 

1034
00:37:07,141 --> 00:37:10,541
(Nilriri Manbo Tour climbs up Sihwa alley) 

1035
00:37:10,541 --> 00:37:12,841
Just like the name, there are poems. 

1036
00:37:12,841 --> 00:37:13,675
And drawings. 

1037
00:37:13,908 --> 00:37:15,575
They are all over the alley. 

1038
00:37:15,575 --> 00:37:16,441
That's where the name comes from? 

1039
00:37:16,441 --> 00:37:17,675
Yes, that's why it's named Sihwa alley. 

1040
00:37:17,675 --> 00:37:20,808
(Sihwa alley in Seosan-dong) 

1041
00:37:20,808 --> 00:37:22,808
Some of the residents 

1042
00:37:22,808 --> 00:37:24,575
wrote the poems and drew the paintings. 

1043
00:37:24,575 --> 00:37:27,341
Some of them are written by poets. 

1044
00:37:27,341 --> 00:37:29,108
People actually still live there. 

1045
00:37:29,575 --> 00:37:30,741
The residents drew these. 

1046
00:37:30,741 --> 00:37:32,041
- They did? / - Yes. 

1047
00:37:32,041 --> 00:37:34,275
- It's similar to the one in Busan. / - Stop talking. 

1048
00:37:34,275 --> 00:37:36,608
- Like Gamcheon Culture Village. / - That's it. 

1049
00:37:36,608 --> 00:37:38,408
Although it's smaller than that one 

1050
00:37:38,408 --> 00:37:39,875
but it's cozy and cute. 

1051
00:37:39,875 --> 00:37:42,008
It's a perfect alley to go for a slow stroll. 

1052
00:37:42,341 --> 00:37:43,675
Since people still live there, 

1053
00:37:43,675 --> 00:37:45,941
you should be careful on your walk. 

1054
00:37:45,941 --> 00:37:52,941
(The three of them climb up as they admire the alley) 

1055
00:37:52,941 --> 00:37:54,741
The drawing style is very innocent. 

1056
00:38:00,841 --> 00:38:01,975
(This time, they walk 1.4km) 

1057
00:38:01,975 --> 00:38:04,308
We have to walk for 1.4km. About 1.5km. 

1058
00:38:04,308 --> 00:38:06,075
- We can easily walk there. / - I see. 

1059
00:38:06,375 --> 00:38:10,375
(We'll walk again?) 

1060
00:38:10,541 --> 00:38:12,275
At times like this, what do we need? 

1061
00:38:12,275 --> 00:38:13,108
A fast mode of transportation. 

1062
00:38:13,108 --> 00:38:15,608
- Taxi. / - We'll go by taxi. 

1063
00:38:16,475 --> 00:38:17,841
I'll feed you some delicious food. 

1064
00:38:17,841 --> 00:38:19,808
What could it be? What will we eat? I'm curious. 

1065
00:38:19,808 --> 00:38:21,008
- It will be amazing. / - Right? 

1066
00:38:22,408 --> 00:38:24,908
- Hello. / - Hello. 

1067
00:38:25,741 --> 00:38:27,175
- We can go now. / - Okay. 

1068
00:38:27,175 --> 00:38:28,608
(They set out to their next destination) 

1069
00:38:28,608 --> 00:38:30,241
I'm hungry. I want to eat something delicious. 

1070
00:38:30,841 --> 00:38:33,208
We're heading to Yeonghae-dong 1-ga. 

1071
00:38:33,808 --> 00:38:35,375
Isn't it really close from here, sir? 

1072
00:38:35,375 --> 00:38:36,875
You'll be there in no time. 

1073
00:38:36,875 --> 00:38:39,241
- How come you know everything? / - Yeah. 

1074
00:38:39,241 --> 00:38:41,841
In which area are you not well-informed? Sports? 

1075
00:38:42,041 --> 00:38:43,741
(Something I don't know much about) 

1076
00:38:43,741 --> 00:38:45,808
- What women want. / - I knew it. 

1077
00:38:45,808 --> 00:38:47,808
- That's right. / - He has a point. 

1078
00:38:47,808 --> 00:38:48,341
I knew he'd say that. 

1079
00:38:48,341 --> 00:38:49,941
His last relationship ended in 2000. 

1080
00:38:50,408 --> 00:38:52,775
(It gets quiet in the car) 

1081
00:38:53,275 --> 00:38:55,875
(I couldn't get married) 

1082
00:38:57,208 --> 00:39:02,175
(6 minutes by taxi from the alley to the restaurant) 

1083
00:39:03,041 --> 00:39:07,875
(If I keep going, where will I be?) 

1084
00:39:08,275 --> 00:39:10,208
Alright, we're here. 

1085
00:39:10,208 --> 00:39:11,341
We're here. 

1086
00:39:11,341 --> 00:39:13,675
- We have arrived. / - Please drive safely. 

1087
00:39:13,675 --> 00:39:15,875
- This is it. Yes. / - That restaurant? 

1088
00:39:15,875 --> 00:39:16,908
Remember what I said? 

1089
00:39:16,908 --> 00:39:19,141
- Is that short rib patty? / - Yes, and... 

1090
00:39:19,941 --> 00:39:21,375
- This is the restaurant. / - This is the one. 

1091
00:39:21,375 --> 00:39:22,041
- Here it is. / - This is it. 

1092
00:39:22,041 --> 00:39:23,275
- You ate short rib patties too? / - This is the place. 

1093
00:39:23,275 --> 00:39:26,141
- Will it beat the one from Danyang? / - Seriously. 

1094
00:39:26,141 --> 00:39:28,375
Did Jinah go home? 

1095
00:39:30,708 --> 00:39:32,241
You've gotten awfully quiet. 

1096
00:39:33,608 --> 00:39:34,841
He must be tired. 

1097
00:39:34,841 --> 00:39:36,508
- You're not sleeping, are you? / - He's exhausted. 

1098
00:39:36,508 --> 00:39:38,075
He's been sleeping for 20 minutes. 

1099
00:39:38,075 --> 00:39:39,308
Let's try this. 

1100
00:39:40,075 --> 00:39:41,341
Hello. 

1101
00:39:41,341 --> 00:39:45,275
There is a short rib patty restaurant... 

1102
00:39:45,275 --> 00:39:46,841
- That's been running for 57 years. / - Is that so? 

1103
00:39:46,841 --> 00:39:49,175
Where's the birthplace of short rib patties in Korea? 

1104
00:39:49,775 --> 00:39:53,241
- Short rib patties... / - People name Danyang for it. 

1105
00:39:53,241 --> 00:39:54,808
I think this restaurant's short rib patties 

1106
00:39:54,808 --> 00:39:56,008
are the best in the country. 

1107
00:39:56,008 --> 00:39:58,008
- It's that good? / - Let me explain. 

1108
00:39:58,741 --> 00:40:01,041
Their patties are a bit similar to Sikyung. 

1109
00:40:01,041 --> 00:40:03,075
- Sung Sikyung? / - Pardon? 

1110
00:40:03,075 --> 00:40:05,241
(Sung Sikyung?) 

1111
00:40:05,241 --> 00:40:06,975
I guess it tastes arrogant. 

1112
00:40:07,508 --> 00:40:09,275
- Hey, you. / - "It tastes arrogant?" 

1113
00:40:09,275 --> 00:40:11,175
"It tastes arrogant." 

1114
00:40:12,108 --> 00:40:14,208
(What a neat comparison) 

1115
00:40:14,508 --> 00:40:18,341
- He's very masculine with us. / - That's right. 

1116
00:40:18,341 --> 00:40:19,875
This short rib patty is just like that. 

1117
00:40:19,875 --> 00:40:21,908
- I'm curious. / - Should we take Sikyung there? 

1118
00:40:22,208 --> 00:40:24,208
- Should we ask him to join us? / - He'd go crazy. 

1119

(Nilriri Manbo Tour's hidden card) 

1120
00:40:26,375 --> 00:40:28,375
If he can confidently say that it's the best... 

1121
00:40:28,375 --> 00:40:29,675
- Then it must be. / - It was. 

1122
00:40:29,675 --> 00:40:32,508
- That restaurant is a real gem. / - If he says so. 

1123
00:40:33,175 --> 00:40:34,808
- That place is no joke. / - What is that? 

1124
00:40:34,808 --> 00:40:37,641
- They grill the bone too? / - It's not what we're used to. 

1125
00:40:37,641 --> 00:40:39,075
- The bones... / - On top of briquettes? 

1126
00:40:39,075 --> 00:40:40,608
- They don't grill it too much. / - On briquettes. 

1127
00:40:40,608 --> 00:40:41,675
They grill it just long enough. 

1128
00:40:41,675 --> 00:40:44,608
That's why it's still juicy. 

1129
00:40:44,608 --> 00:40:45,841
Goodness, look at that.

It's great timing though.

After running around in the uniform, 

1142
00:41:20,868 --> 00:41:22,501
I've become hungry.

- Usually, it's shared by two though. / - It's for two. 

1165
00:42:02,268 --> 00:42:04,834
Most customers can't finish it alone. 

1166

- I love it. / - $25 for one person. 

1167

If usual short rib patties are submissive... 

1193
00:43:04,734 --> 00:43:07,468
- That's right. / - This rib patty is... 

1194
00:43:08,568 --> 00:43:11,834
Fighting against me in my mouth. 

1195
00:43:11,834 --> 00:43:12,834
I know. 

1196
00:43:12,834 --> 00:43:14,301
(The short rib patty resists in the mouth) 

1197
00:43:14,301 --> 00:43:18,368
No other short rib patty has such a texture. 

1198
00:43:18,368 --> 00:43:21,034
- It's hard to cook it perfectly. / - Exactly. 

1199
00:43:21,034 --> 00:43:24,001
It has a very rough and unique texture. 

1200
00:43:24,401 --> 00:43:25,434
You look so happy. 

1201
00:43:25,434 --> 00:43:28,034
(The patty is juicy and the sauce is sweet) 

1202
00:43:28,034 --> 00:43:30,768
Look at the chunks of the patty. 

1203
00:43:30,768 --> 00:43:33,034
- I know. / - The patty consists of the chunks. 

1204
00:43:33,034 --> 00:43:35,134
Usually, it's hard to pick up the patty with chopsticks. 

1205
00:43:35,534 --> 00:43:38,501
- This must be chewed thoroughly. / - Exactly. 

1206
00:43:38,534 --> 00:43:39,634
You can't just swallow it. 

1207
00:43:39,634 --> 00:43:41,234
- The moment I'm about to swallow it... / - That's true. 

1208
00:43:41,234 --> 00:43:42,534
The patty talks to me. 

1209
00:43:42,534 --> 00:43:44,501
"You can't swallow me yet." 

1210
00:43:44,634 --> 00:43:47,168
- "You'd better chew me more." / - The patty talks. 

1211
00:43:47,968 --> 00:43:51,401
That short rib patties do not melt in your mouth. 

1212
00:43:51,401 --> 00:43:52,601
It's not like that at all. 

1213
00:43:52,601 --> 00:43:55,568
- So this has a nice firm texture. / - It's really chewy. 

1214
00:43:55,568 --> 00:43:56,501
(Feeling absorbed) 

1215
00:43:57,101 --> 00:43:59,101
Usually, short rib patty is not stuck to the rib. 

1216
00:43:59,101 --> 00:44:00,768
They remove the meat from the bone. 

1217
00:44:00,768 --> 00:44:02,601
Usually, short rib patty doesn't 

1218
00:44:02,601 --> 00:44:03,934
come with the rib stuck to it. 

1219
00:44:05,868 --> 00:44:08,834
The sauce isn't too sweet. 

1220
00:44:08,834 --> 00:44:10,934
- No. / - It could be too sweet sometimes. 

1221
00:44:10,934 --> 00:44:12,968
- I don't like sweet meat. / - I know. 

1222
00:44:13,934 --> 00:44:16,034
It's perfectly seasoned. 

1223
00:44:16,368 --> 00:44:18,901
Junghun, I really love it. 

1224
00:44:19,534 --> 00:44:20,168
This kind of short rib patty 

1225
00:44:20,168 --> 00:44:21,534
doesn't sell on home shopping. 

1226
00:44:22,001 --> 00:44:22,901
(Laughing) 

1227
00:44:22,901 --> 00:44:25,001
- What? / - I think I should... 

1228
00:44:25,001 --> 00:44:27,701
- You're working here. / - Get the owner's number. 

1229
00:44:28,868 --> 00:44:31,168
Cheonsik wants to sell this on home shopping. 

1230
00:44:31,168 --> 00:44:34,901
- Cheonsik is eyeing this item. / - I wanted to launch it. 

1231
00:44:35,268 --> 00:44:37,434
This restaurant is over 50 years old. 

1232
00:44:37,434 --> 00:44:39,401
It's an old restaurant. Over half a century. 

1233
00:44:39,401 --> 00:44:43,134
(Cheonsik's Battle Trip, it's not like the usual rib patties) 

1234
00:44:43,134 --> 00:44:45,534
(Fantastic short rib patty for wild men!) 

1235
00:44:45,534 --> 00:44:48,634
($25 per portion) 

1236
00:44:49,168 --> 00:44:51,001
The real hidden card is coming next. 

1237
00:44:51,268 --> 00:44:53,668
There's one more. 

1238
00:44:53,834 --> 00:44:55,401
(They stayed in this restaurant for a while) 

1239
00:44:55,401 --> 00:44:57,101
Now I'm getting full. 

1240
00:44:57,834 --> 00:45:00,301
We're now traveling the longest distance in this tour. 

1241
00:45:00,301 --> 00:45:01,834
What do we need then? 

1242
00:45:01,834 --> 00:45:03,501
- Taxi. / - We're going there by taxi. 

1243
00:45:04,368 --> 00:45:09,634
(They ride a taxi for about 16 minutes) 

1244
00:45:10,034 --> 00:45:12,368
- Now... / - What now? 

1245
00:45:12,368 --> 00:45:14,534
To wrap up our day in Mokpo beautifully, 

1246
00:45:14,534 --> 00:45:16,868
we're going to drink a little bit of alcohol. 

1247
00:45:16,868 --> 00:45:18,468
- Something light. / - Let's go simple. 

1248
00:45:18,468 --> 00:45:23,934
I don't need to give you any hint about this. 

1249
00:45:23,934 --> 00:45:25,501
You'll know it by its smell. 

1250
00:45:26,268 --> 00:45:27,268
- The smell of the food? / - You'll smell it. 

1251
00:45:27,268 --> 00:45:28,434
- We can smell it? / - Yes. 

1252
00:45:28,868 --> 00:45:31,168
- Don't go to Heuksando. / - Fermented skate? 

1253
00:45:31,568 --> 00:45:32,768
It's a food to eat with alcohol. 

1254
00:45:32,768 --> 00:45:34,268
Fermented skate is delicious. 

1255
00:45:34,268 --> 00:45:36,068
Let's wrap up the day here. 

1256
00:45:36,068 --> 00:45:38,068
It goes amazing with rice wine. 

1257
00:45:38,534 --> 00:45:41,001
(Nilriri Manbo Tour's hidden card) 

1258
00:45:41,001 --> 00:45:44,701
(Fermented skate dish) 

1259
00:45:45,701 --> 00:45:46,768
(Forget all the other fermented skate) 

1260
00:45:46,768 --> 00:45:48,634
- This is a skate's nose. / - What's that? 

1261
00:45:48,634 --> 00:45:50,934
- This was amazing too. / - What's that in the middle? 

1262
00:45:51,034 --> 00:45:52,834
- It's a skate's nose. / - Nose? 

1263
00:45:52,834 --> 00:45:54,101
It's soy sauce marinated crabs. 

1264
00:45:54,534 --> 00:45:56,068
- Marinated crabs. / - It's a set meal. 

1265
00:45:56,068 --> 00:45:56,934
That's on the house. 

1266
00:45:56,934 --> 00:45:58,834
- The king of side dishes. / - It comes with the main. 

1267
00:45:58,834 --> 00:46:00,401
- Marinated crab is served freely. / - Look at that. 

1268
00:46:00,401 --> 00:46:02,101
It comes with the main dish. 

1269
00:46:02,901 --> 00:46:05,234
(Fermented skate set, $85) 

1270
00:46:05,234 --> 00:46:07,068
That's a meal for four. 

1271
00:46:07,068 --> 00:46:08,068
It's very cheap. 

1272
00:46:08,068 --> 00:46:11,034
They serve skate from Korea, it's not expensive. 

1273
00:46:11,034 --> 00:46:12,201
Marinated crabs are included. 

1274
00:46:12,201 --> 00:46:14,801
- $85 for 4. / - It's a good price. 

1275
00:46:14,801 --> 00:46:16,568
In Seoul, skate from Korea would be... 

1276
00:46:16,568 --> 00:46:18,301
- Over $100. / - It's more than $100. 

1277
00:46:18,301 --> 00:46:19,768
Skate isn't cheap. 

1278
00:46:20,001 --> 00:46:23,468
This is fresh skate from Heuksando... 

1279
00:46:23,468 --> 00:46:25,934
- That is barely fermented. / - I see. 

1280
00:46:26,101 --> 00:46:28,468
- Let me make a tower. / - Let's do it. 

1281
00:46:28,768 --> 00:46:30,768
- It's fermented skate combo. / - Jeollanam-do kimchi. 

1282
00:46:30,968 --> 00:46:32,134
The color of the kimchi looks beautiful. 

1283
00:46:32,134 --> 00:46:35,001
That aged kimchi looks really delicious. 

1284
00:46:35,001 --> 00:46:36,834
That's fermented skate. 

1285
00:46:36,834 --> 00:46:38,001
(Aged kimchi,  boiled pork, fermented skate) 

1286
00:46:39,568 --> 00:46:41,168
Let's have a bite and drink. 

1287
00:46:41,168 --> 00:46:43,301
This is my favorite. 

1288
00:46:43,301 --> 00:46:44,568
Clinking the glasses while holding food. 

1289
00:46:45,134 --> 00:46:47,868
Having the food ready. 

1290
00:46:47,868 --> 00:46:49,901
- Say our team name. / - Nilriri Manbo. 

1291
00:46:49,901 --> 00:46:52,134
It's a bit more transparent than 

1292
00:46:52,134 --> 00:46:53,434
the fermented skate I know. 

1293
00:46:53,434 --> 00:46:55,501
Right? This skate is... 

1294
00:46:55,901 --> 00:46:58,168
Not fermented much. 

1295
00:46:58,168 --> 00:47:00,401
It's more like raw fish. 

1296
00:47:00,401 --> 00:47:01,801
This isn't that pungent. 

1297
00:47:01,801 --> 00:47:06,201
- No, it's not. / - This is fresh. 

1298
00:47:06,201 --> 00:47:08,168
Some people might not realize 

1299
00:47:08,168 --> 00:47:09,634
that this is fermented skate. 

1300
00:47:09,634 --> 00:47:10,601
- I can see that. / - For real. 

1301
00:47:10,601 --> 00:47:13,701
- This can be any deboned raw fish. / - That's true. 

1302
00:47:13,701 --> 00:47:15,001
(It's like a regular deboned raw fish) 

1303
00:47:15,001 --> 00:47:17,834
It's very fresh like regular raw fish. 

1304
00:47:17,834 --> 00:47:20,901
It doesn't have a strong smell at all. 

1305
00:47:20,901 --> 00:47:24,001
It doesn't burn your throat or nose. 

1306
00:47:24,001 --> 00:47:25,201
Those who haven't tried fermented skate 

1307
00:47:25,201 --> 00:47:27,101
would like this. 

1308
00:47:27,101 --> 00:47:28,268
You're right. 

1309
00:47:28,534 --> 00:47:30,734
When you eat fermented skate, 

1310
00:47:30,734 --> 00:47:33,101
you usually focus on the smell 

1311
00:47:33,101 --> 00:47:36,368
and don't think much about 

1312
00:47:36,368 --> 00:47:38,368
its texture. 

1313
00:47:38,368 --> 00:47:40,001
- But today, I recognized... / - You're right. 

1314
00:47:40,001 --> 00:47:43,001
It's very chewy and bouncy. 

1315
00:47:43,001 --> 00:47:46,101
My molars bounce it back when I chew it. 

1316
00:47:46,101 --> 00:47:48,668
There are bones but they don't feel like bones. 

1317
00:47:49,068 --> 00:47:52,134
It's like a very hard chewing gum. 

1318
00:47:52,134 --> 00:47:53,334
(That's an amazing way to put it) 

1319
00:47:53,334 --> 00:47:55,001
- You know what I mean. / - Yes. 

1320
00:47:55,001 --> 00:47:59,134
(Fermented skate is like a chewing gum) 

1321
00:48:00,134 --> 00:48:02,101
It goes well with sesame oil as well. 

1322
00:48:02,301 --> 00:48:03,601
- I love sesame oil. / - It's served as well. 

1323
00:48:03,601 --> 00:48:05,334
- It's good with just salt too. / - Like croaker. 

1324
00:48:05,334 --> 00:48:07,034
- It's delicious that way too. / - That's how experts eat. 

1325
00:48:07,301 --> 00:48:08,634
I usually don't eat fermented skate 

1326
00:48:08,634 --> 00:48:10,401
but I'd like to try this one. 

1327
00:48:11,134 --> 00:48:12,468
Enjoy. 

1328
00:48:12,468 --> 00:48:14,701
(After eating fermented skate, they drink rice wine) 

1329
00:48:15,201 --> 00:48:17,101
(It smells nice) 

1330
00:48:17,668 --> 00:48:20,568
It goes down very nicely, doesn't it? 

1331
00:48:20,568 --> 00:48:23,568
(This is amazing) 

1332
00:48:23,568 --> 00:48:24,701
This is so good. 

1333
00:48:25,668 --> 00:48:28,001
When I saw its color, I thought it'd be like... 

1334
00:48:28,001 --> 00:48:30,568
- Pumpkin rice wine. / - Look at that. 

1335
00:48:30,568 --> 00:48:31,934
It's not pumpkin rice wine? 

1336
00:48:31,934 --> 00:48:34,001
- It's made of honeysuckle. / - Honeysuckle. 

1337
00:48:34,001 --> 00:48:35,834
- It's a little bitter. / - I see. 

1338
00:48:35,834 --> 00:48:37,001
(Bitter honeysuckle rice wine) 

1339
00:48:37,001 --> 00:48:38,634
- Right. / - I like that it's not so sweet. 

1340
00:48:38,634 --> 00:48:40,434
Yet it has a rich flavor. 

1341
00:48:41,668 --> 00:48:43,168
This restaurant has great soy sauce marinated crabs. 

1342
00:48:43,168 --> 00:48:44,468
Does that come with fermented skate? 

1343
00:48:44,468 --> 00:48:46,568
Yes, it's in the set. 

1344
00:48:46,568 --> 00:48:48,268
It looks delicious. 

1345
00:48:49,568 --> 00:48:54,801
(He takes a big bite) 

1346
00:48:56,468 --> 00:49:00,601
(It's delicious) 

1347
00:49:01,501 --> 00:49:03,334
Personally, 

1348
00:49:03,334 --> 00:49:04,634
I don't like the saltiness of marinated crabs. 

1349
00:49:05,501 --> 00:49:08,468
It's marinated with soy sauce. If it's salty... 

1350
00:49:08,468 --> 00:49:09,768
- I see what you mean. / - I don't like it too salty. 

1351
00:49:10,301 --> 00:49:12,101
- This one is flavorful. / - It is. 

1352
00:49:12,101 --> 00:49:13,534
- It's pretty good. / - You're right. It's flavorful. 

1353
00:49:13,534 --> 00:49:17,334
We're here for fermented skate 

1354
00:49:17,334 --> 00:49:20,501
but you can eat soy sauce marinated crabs too. 

1355
00:49:20,501 --> 00:49:24,801
Seriously, it's too good for it to be just a side dish. 

1356
00:49:28,301 --> 00:49:30,334
I thought I was full but I can eat more. 

1357
00:49:30,334 --> 00:49:31,734
(They cleanse their palate with rice wine) 

1358
00:49:31,734 --> 00:49:34,001
- It must be delicious. / - It was really delicious. 

1359
00:49:34,001 --> 00:49:37,368
It must be very hard to resist the food. 

1360
00:49:37,368 --> 00:49:39,201
It's not like you'll be on a diet when you travel. 

1361
00:49:39,201 --> 00:49:40,634
- That's the sesame oil. / - Here's the sesame oil. 

1362
00:49:40,634 --> 00:49:42,201
- Have you tried it? / - Of course. 

1363
00:49:47,668 --> 00:49:49,534
I think the owner prepared 

1364
00:49:49,534 --> 00:49:52,001
something stronger for us. 

1365
00:49:52,001 --> 00:49:54,434
Later, could you please bring us the strong one? 

1366
00:49:54,434 --> 00:49:56,534
Something that'd make us cry. 

1367
00:49:57,401 --> 00:49:58,234
(You should taste the real fermented skate here) 

1368
00:49:58,234 --> 00:49:59,801
- It's a strong one. / - It's like cheese. 

1369
00:50:00,468 --> 00:50:01,501
The color is different. 

1370
00:50:01,501 --> 00:50:02,801
You can smell it already when she brings it in. 

1371
00:50:02,801 --> 00:50:03,868
Of course it's different. 

1372
00:50:03,868 --> 00:50:05,801
It's fermented for a month. 

1373
00:50:05,801 --> 00:50:08,201
It tastes good when it's fermented. 

1374
00:50:08,201 --> 00:50:09,268
You're right. 

1375
00:50:09,368 --> 00:50:11,701
Only masters can enjoy it. I can't even eat it. 

1376
00:50:12,468 --> 00:50:14,501
This is the scent I've wanted. 

1377
00:50:14,734 --> 00:50:15,834
This is the smell. 

1378
00:50:17,668 --> 00:50:18,801
This is it. 

1379
00:50:20,901 --> 00:50:22,901
(Nervous) 

1380
00:50:22,901 --> 00:50:24,801
- Is this the smell you've wanted? / - Yes. 

1381
00:50:24,801 --> 00:50:25,901
I like the smell. 

1382
00:50:26,134 --> 00:50:29,734
(He can feel the pungent smell of fermented skate) 

1383
00:50:29,734 --> 00:50:32,101
- That's the smell. / - It smells like the bathroom. 

1384
00:50:32,101 --> 00:50:34,134
It will cure a sinus cold. 

1385
00:50:34,134 --> 00:50:36,534
(Blissful?) 

1386
00:50:36,534 --> 00:50:38,401
The color looks totally different. 

1387
00:50:38,401 --> 00:50:39,834
This is transparent, and this is not. 

1388
00:50:39,834 --> 00:50:41,334
- It's totally different. / - The color is different. 

1389
00:50:41,334 --> 00:50:42,701
- Look at the color. / - Why is it so different? 

1390
00:50:42,701 --> 00:50:44,734
(The difference is clearly visible to the naked eye) 

1391
00:50:45,534 --> 00:50:48,368
(What does the skate fermented for 30 days taste like?) 

1392
00:50:48,368 --> 00:50:49,334
Seriously... 

1393
00:50:49,734 --> 00:50:52,934
This is the most exciting moment... 

1394
00:50:52,934 --> 00:50:54,868
- Of the day. / - Really? 

1395
00:50:55,401 --> 00:50:56,968
Without the sauce. 

1396
00:50:56,968 --> 00:50:58,968
Mr. Noh seems to love that. 

1397
00:50:58,968 --> 00:51:00,034
He just eats it? 

1398
00:51:00,034 --> 00:51:01,668
- Without sauce? / - I don't need the sauce. 

1399
00:51:02,101 --> 00:51:03,701
He really loves fermented skate. 

1400
00:51:03,701 --> 00:51:06,534
(Calm and peaceful) 

1401
00:51:06,801 --> 00:51:08,701
He doesn't budge an inch. 

1402
00:51:09,168 --> 00:51:11,134
It's peaceful like a nap on Sunday. 

1403
00:51:11,134 --> 00:51:12,901
It's so peaceful. 

1404
00:51:13,168 --> 00:51:15,601
(They are curious about the taste of fermented skate) 

1405
00:51:15,601 --> 00:51:16,968
It's skate fermented for 30 days. 

1406
00:51:17,168 --> 00:51:18,268
I'll try. 

1407
00:51:18,268 --> 00:51:19,368
Try it. 

1408
00:51:19,368 --> 00:51:21,001
(He just dips it in salt to appreciate the taste of skate) 

1409
00:51:21,001 --> 00:51:22,234
He's a novice. 

1410
00:51:22,234 --> 00:51:23,568
Junghun eats it so well. 

1411
00:51:23,801 --> 00:51:24,868
He can't eat it. 

1412
00:51:24,868 --> 00:51:26,234
(They understand how he feels) 

1413
00:51:26,234 --> 00:51:27,834
- It was so strong. / - I know how he feels. 

1414
00:51:27,834 --> 00:51:29,334
- It was so strong. / - He breathed in. 

1415
00:51:29,334 --> 00:51:31,834
You can feel it as you breathe in. 

1416
00:51:32,401 --> 00:51:33,634
He's a novice. 

1417
00:51:33,634 --> 00:51:35,001
Junghun eats it so well. 

1418
00:51:35,368 --> 00:51:37,301
Why did you spit it back out? 

1419
00:51:37,301 --> 00:51:39,934
It touched my uvula. 

1420
00:51:40,934 --> 00:51:43,601
It's still a bit pink in the middle. 

1421
00:51:43,601 --> 00:51:44,534
(He tries it for real) 

1422
00:51:44,768 --> 00:51:49,201
(Hyunbo is doing better than expected) 

1423
00:51:49,201 --> 00:51:51,201
- I thought... / - He could eat 10 pieces. 

1424
00:51:51,534 --> 00:51:53,134
(There it is) 

1425
00:51:53,134 --> 00:51:55,001
You can feel it a bit later. 

1426
00:51:55,534 --> 00:51:57,001
That's when you should drink rice wine. 

1427
00:51:57,101 --> 00:51:58,301
Do you like it? 

1428
00:51:59,468 --> 00:52:01,201
This feels different from a cough. 

1429
00:52:01,701 --> 00:52:03,234
It's not like a cough. 

1430
00:52:03,601 --> 00:52:05,401
It comes from the diaphragm. 

1431
00:52:06,468 --> 00:52:07,568
Like this. 

1432
00:52:07,568 --> 00:52:08,734
(Is it that bad?) 

1433
00:52:10,068 --> 00:52:11,168
I'm excited. 

1434
00:52:11,401 --> 00:52:13,468
Cheonsik, you've tried fermented skate before, right? 

1435
00:52:13,468 --> 00:52:14,801
I like fermented skate but... 

1436
00:52:15,168 --> 00:52:17,268
The smell has great implications. 

1437
00:52:17,968 --> 00:52:20,934
(Cheonsik tastes it with just a bit of salt as well) 

1438
00:52:21,801 --> 00:52:23,034
I want to blow the smell off. 

1439
00:52:23,234 --> 00:52:24,668
- Not because it's hot. / - Wait. 

1440
00:52:24,801 --> 00:52:25,968
It's against the rule. 

1441
00:52:25,968 --> 00:52:27,168
(A foul) 

1442
00:52:27,634 --> 00:52:29,068
(He finally takes a bite) 

1443
00:52:29,068 --> 00:52:29,901
I'm actually... 

1444
00:52:29,901 --> 00:52:31,434
You have to chew it before you swallow it. 

1445
00:52:31,434 --> 00:52:32,668
- I really like fermented skate. / - You should... 

1446
00:52:32,668 --> 00:52:34,468
Chew it at least 20 times. 

1447
00:52:34,934 --> 00:52:36,768
You have to wait a while. 

1448
00:52:36,768 --> 00:52:37,901
(Peaceful) 

1449
00:52:37,901 --> 00:52:39,068
For about 40 seconds. 

1450
00:52:39,468 --> 00:52:40,734
(Breathing hard) 

1451
00:52:40,734 --> 00:52:43,434
He's breathing harder. 

1452
00:52:43,901 --> 00:52:45,334
(They burst into laughter) 

1453
00:52:45,334 --> 00:52:47,068
His nose seems to have changed. 

1454
00:52:49,534 --> 00:52:56,134
(The day passes as they fight with fermented skate) 

1455
00:52:56,868 --> 00:53:00,901
You should eat fermented skate with some kimchi... 

1456
00:53:01,234 --> 00:53:03,301
- Instead of sesame oil and salt. / - That's right. 

1457
00:53:03,301 --> 00:53:05,401
And with some boiled pork. 

1458
00:53:05,401 --> 00:53:07,901
- Boiled pork. / - You should eat it with them. 

1459
00:53:07,901 --> 00:53:10,768
Then kimchi neutralizes the smell. 

1460
00:53:10,768 --> 00:53:12,801
- That's right. / - It tastes better that way. 

1461
00:53:14,734 --> 00:53:16,601
(It's not over yet) 

1462
00:53:16,601 --> 00:53:17,968
It's not over yet. 

1463
00:53:17,968 --> 00:53:19,434
Only a day has passed. 

1464
00:53:19,434 --> 00:53:21,134
We only watched them eat. 

1465
00:53:21,134 --> 00:53:22,968
- They went there to eat. / - We went there to eat. 

1466
00:53:23,234 --> 00:53:24,934
- We prepared a lot, right? / - You did. 

1467
00:53:24,934 --> 00:53:26,468
We prepared a lot. 

1468
00:53:26,468 --> 00:53:27,601
This feels great. 

1469
00:53:27,601 --> 00:53:29,768
(They don't stop laughing on the second day) 

1470
00:53:29,768 --> 00:53:31,201
What is going on? 

1471
00:53:31,201 --> 00:53:32,501
Gosh, what is that? 

1472
00:53:32,501 --> 00:53:33,734
I love that place. 

1473
00:53:33,734 --> 00:53:35,001
It looks amazing. 

1474
00:53:35,001 --> 00:53:36,168
I like things like this. 

1475
00:53:36,168 --> 00:53:37,801
I love the colors. 

1476
00:53:39,068 --> 00:53:40,968
Mokpo is the best. 

1477
00:53:40,968 --> 00:53:42,501
(The night view is a lot flashier than the day) 

1478
00:53:43,401 --> 00:53:45,668
(Alcohol can't be missed) 

1479
00:53:46,701 --> 00:53:50,801
(And) 

1480
00:53:50,801 --> 00:53:52,001
I love it. 

1481
00:53:53,168 --> 00:53:55,401
- This is unbelievable. / - It's great, isn't it? 

1482
00:53:55,401 --> 00:53:56,668
It's great? 

1483
00:53:56,668 --> 00:53:58,468
- Where are they? / - You could come here... 

1484
00:53:58,468 --> 00:54:00,534
On the train just to eat this. 

1485
00:54:00,534 --> 00:54:01,901
- You could. / - Yeah. 

1486
00:54:02,434 --> 00:54:05,201
This is just perfect. 

1487
00:54:06,801 --> 00:54:09,601
(Nilriri Manbo Tour, Day 2) 

1488
00:54:09,601 --> 00:54:12,401
(Breakfast, ride along the coast, night of Mokpo) 

1489
00:54:15,368 --> 00:54:20,701
(The clear sky welcomes them on the 2nd day) 

1490
00:54:21,734 --> 00:54:25,934
(They greet the morning sun of Mokpo) 

1491
00:54:26,234 --> 00:54:29,934
The sun is up and high. You got up so late. 

1492
00:54:29,934 --> 00:54:32,201
That's because we let loose and had a drink last night. 

1493
00:54:32,201 --> 00:54:34,068
You drank with us. 

1494
00:54:34,068 --> 00:54:35,768
- He drank more than us. / - He pretends he didn't. 

1495
00:54:35,768 --> 00:54:36,801
He drank a lot. 

1496
00:54:36,801 --> 00:54:38,234
They are all swollen. 

1497
00:54:38,234 --> 00:54:39,568
- They are. / - We were swollen a lot. 

1498
00:54:39,568 --> 00:54:40,634
We ate a lot. 

1499
00:54:40,634 --> 00:54:43,268
I got up after a sound sleep. 

1500
00:54:43,268 --> 00:54:45,568
- And I saw it all cleared up. / - I know. 

1501
00:54:45,568 --> 00:54:47,868
- It's amazing. / - Look at the sky. 

1502
00:54:48,101 --> 00:54:48,834
It's beautiful. 

1503
00:54:48,834 --> 00:54:50,934
Mokpo is a small city, so we didn't need to hurry 

1504
00:54:50,934 --> 00:54:52,101
and we slept enough. 

1505
00:54:52,501 --> 00:54:54,701
And we got up late. 

1506
00:54:54,701 --> 00:54:56,634
When would I sleep in like that? 

1507
00:54:56,968 --> 00:55:00,301
Because of the baby, you can't sleep in. 

1508
00:55:00,301 --> 00:55:02,168
A father of two children can't sleep in, right? 

1509
00:55:02,501 --> 00:55:03,768
I have to get up at least by 8 a.m. 

1510
00:55:03,768 --> 00:55:05,601
We can have an intensive trip here. 

1511
00:55:05,601 --> 00:55:06,934
Even if we get up late, 

1512
00:55:06,934 --> 00:55:09,568
we don't need to hurry. 

1513
00:55:09,568 --> 00:55:11,368
We talked about this before the trip. 

1514
00:55:11,368 --> 00:55:12,901
- I want to walk slowly. / - That's right. 

1515
00:55:12,901 --> 00:55:14,434
Anyway, since we got up late, 

1516
00:55:14,434 --> 00:55:16,068
we should have breakfast before lunchtime. 

1517
00:55:16,434 --> 00:55:17,601
Are you sure you can handle it? 

1518
00:55:17,901 --> 00:55:19,068
What is it? 

1519
00:55:19,068 --> 00:55:20,201
- What is it? / - Can you handle it? 

1520
00:55:20,201 --> 00:55:22,168
Is this your hidden card? 

1521
00:55:22,168 --> 00:55:24,434
That's right. It's unknown to the public. 

1522
00:55:24,434 --> 00:55:25,568
It's been hidden. 

1523
00:55:27,734 --> 00:55:29,268
They look slimmer here before the trip. 

1524
00:55:30,368 --> 00:55:32,401
He's not swollen at all before the trip. 

1525
00:55:32,401 --> 00:55:33,701
I got puffy in a day. 

1526
00:55:34,434 --> 00:55:35,701
I actually... 

1527
00:55:36,001 --> 00:55:38,801
Went to Mokpo again a few days ago 

1528
00:55:38,801 --> 00:55:39,934
because it was so great. 

1529
00:55:39,934 --> 00:55:43,401
I will show you some pictures of the food I had there. 

1530
00:55:43,901 --> 00:55:45,534
- Here. / - I'm excited. 

1531
00:55:45,534 --> 00:55:47,068
This is... 

1532
00:55:47,234 --> 00:55:48,968
- What I had on the last day. / - It looks delicious. 

1533
00:55:48,968 --> 00:55:51,034
- I went there a while ago. / - What is that? 

1534
00:55:51,034 --> 00:55:53,468
I think the highlight of the food of Jeollanam-do 

1535
00:55:53,468 --> 00:55:54,534
is a meal set. 

1536
00:55:54,534 --> 00:55:57,001
- You're right. / - It's amazing. 

1537
00:55:57,001 --> 00:55:59,134
- I love it. / - Me too. 

1538
00:55:59,134 --> 00:56:01,368
- I think it's about $12. / - Right. 

1539
00:56:01,368 --> 00:56:02,268
About $12 to $15. 

1540
00:56:02,268 --> 00:56:04,534
- It was only $8. / - $8? 

1541
00:56:04,534 --> 00:56:06,968
- What? / - Can you believe it? It's only $8. 

1542
00:56:06,968 --> 00:56:08,768
- How many side dishes? / - 18 side dishes. 

1543
00:56:08,768 --> 00:56:10,601
- Did you say 18? / - Total. 

1544
00:56:10,601 --> 00:56:11,768
- For breakfast? / - Yes. 

1545
00:56:11,768 --> 00:56:13,834
You still get 16 side dishes for $8 even if you go alone. 

1546
00:56:13,834 --> 00:56:15,334
It has to be at least $10? 

1547
00:56:15,334 --> 00:56:16,534
Why is it only $8? 

1548
00:56:17,334 --> 00:56:19,334
(Nilriri Manbo Tour's hidden card) 

1549
00:56:19,334 --> 00:56:22,668
(A meal set) 

1550
00:56:23,601 --> 00:56:27,234
(Around 20 side dishes) 

1551
00:56:27,668 --> 00:56:32,201
(The greatest happiness you can get for $8) 

1552
00:56:32,601 --> 00:56:34,834
There's no single dish you wouldn't like. 

1553
00:56:34,834 --> 00:56:36,634
There are restaurants who serve many dishes... 

1554
00:56:36,634 --> 00:56:37,834
- That aren't so good. / - Yeah. 

1555
00:56:37,834 --> 00:56:38,901
Egg roll. 

1556
00:56:38,901 --> 00:56:40,401
They make the egg roll to order. 

1557
00:56:40,401 --> 00:56:41,434
That's a lot. 

1558
00:56:41,434 --> 00:56:44,068
Don't egg rolls cost over $8 in tent bars in Seoul? 

1559
00:56:44,068 --> 00:56:45,034
- Exactly. / - It's about $10. 

1560
00:56:45,034 --> 00:56:46,601
It even costs $12 to $15 at some restaurants. 

1561
00:56:46,601 --> 00:56:47,468
That's right. 

1562
00:56:47,468 --> 00:56:48,501
(The hidden card of hidden cards) 

1563
00:56:49,034 --> 00:56:52,201
I go to a Korean restaurant to have a meal set 

1564
00:56:52,201 --> 00:56:53,334
at least once. 

1565
00:56:53,334 --> 00:56:54,834
A meal set is great. 

1566
00:56:54,834 --> 00:56:56,701
- It is. / - It's great. 

1567
00:56:56,701 --> 00:56:58,168
A Korean table d'hote is expensive 

1568
00:56:58,168 --> 00:56:59,668
but a meal set is cheap. 

1569
00:56:59,668 --> 00:57:01,601
I can't order a Korean table d'hote alone. 

1570
00:57:01,601 --> 00:57:03,768
While a Korean table d'hote is like a feast table... 

1571
00:57:03,768 --> 00:57:06,101
- A meal set is like mom's cooking. / - Right. 

1572
00:57:06,101 --> 00:57:07,668
I should go there before this episode airs. 

1573
00:57:07,668 --> 00:57:09,601
Sook just said she should go there before 

1574
00:57:09,601 --> 00:57:10,668
this episode airs. 

1575
00:57:11,001 --> 00:57:12,168
Before this is aired. 

1576
00:57:12,168 --> 00:57:15,001
Once this is aired, people would line up there. 

1577
00:57:15,234 --> 00:57:17,068
Mokpo is a 4-hour drive. 

1578
00:57:17,068 --> 00:57:18,101
It looks amazing. 

1579
00:57:18,101 --> 00:57:19,868
(The side dishes keep coming) 

1580
00:57:19,868 --> 00:57:21,334
This deserves to be the hidden card. 

1581
00:57:21,901 --> 00:57:23,501
This is another level. 

1582
00:57:23,501 --> 00:57:26,434
I wonder how they even profit. 

1583
00:57:26,434 --> 00:57:27,868
There won't be much profit. 

1584
00:57:27,868 --> 00:57:29,634
- It's her heart. / - She's just generous. 

1585
00:57:29,634 --> 00:57:31,301
She's generous. 

1586
00:57:31,301 --> 00:57:35,301
I will show you how they served us the rice. 

1587
00:57:35,301 --> 00:57:37,101
- It's so full. / - Right. 

1588
00:57:37,268 --> 00:57:38,534
It looks like the rising sun. 

1589
00:57:38,534 --> 00:57:39,601
And we had more rice. 

1590
00:57:39,601 --> 00:57:42,101
When I was a kid, I drew a bowl of rice just like that. 

1591
00:57:42,101 --> 00:57:44,534
People used to give rice like that in the past. 

1592
00:57:44,534 --> 00:57:45,634
Braised cutlassfish as a side dish? 

1593
00:57:45,634 --> 00:57:46,634
Usually, this is served as a main dish. 

1594
00:57:48,201 --> 00:57:50,268
(Braised cutlassfish) 

1595
00:57:50,268 --> 00:57:51,634
It's braised cutlassfish. 

1596
00:57:52,434 --> 00:57:55,468
- They serve braised cutlassfish? / - It's in season. 

1597
00:57:56,268 --> 00:57:58,001
It has the taste of mom's cooking. 

1598
00:57:58,001 --> 00:58:01,668
I like braised cutlassfish served in a restaurant 

1599
00:58:01,668 --> 00:58:02,868
but this doesn't taste like that. 

1600
00:58:02,868 --> 00:58:04,834
It's more like mom's cooking. 

1601
00:58:05,368 --> 00:58:06,834
It's really good. 

1602
00:58:06,834 --> 00:58:11,368
(Braised cutlassfish is rarely served in a meal set) 

1603
00:58:12,368 --> 00:58:17,301
(They cook it off hand with fresh ingredients) 

1604
00:58:17,301 --> 00:58:19,434
Cutlassfish from Jeju-do is better than 

1605
00:58:19,434 --> 00:58:20,934
one from Mokpo. 

1606
00:58:20,934 --> 00:58:24,501
Jeju-do's cutlassfish is different to Mokpo's. 

1607
00:58:24,501 --> 00:58:26,901
- It's huge and delicious. / - Jeju-do is best. 

1608
00:58:27,301 --> 00:58:28,401
It's huge and delicious. 

1609
00:58:28,568 --> 00:58:31,401
We haven't even touched these side dishes yet. 

1610
00:58:31,401 --> 00:58:33,801
They serve about 20 side dishes. 

1611
00:58:33,801 --> 00:58:35,301
(They don't even know what to eat first) 

1612
00:58:35,301 --> 00:58:38,001
A good thing about a meal set is 

1613
00:58:38,001 --> 00:58:39,968
that they serve different dishes every day. 

1614
00:58:39,968 --> 00:58:41,768
(They serve different dishes each season) 

1615
00:58:41,768 --> 00:58:43,668
I think this is the best thing 

1616
00:58:43,668 --> 00:58:45,701
I can get with $8. 

1617
00:58:46,668 --> 00:58:47,601
It has all kinds of dishes. 

1618
00:58:47,601 --> 00:58:48,834
They also serve grilled yellow corvina. 

1619
00:58:48,834 --> 00:58:50,101
Even yellow corvina? 

1620
00:58:50,101 --> 00:58:52,168
(Grilled yellow corvina) 

1621
00:58:52,168 --> 00:58:53,834
It's amazing. What's that? Is it seasoned skate? 

1622
00:58:53,834 --> 00:58:56,134
- Seasoned young skate. / - Seasoned young skate? 

1623
00:58:56,134 --> 00:58:57,534
- This is seasoned eggplant. / - Seasoned eggplant. 

1624
00:58:57,534 --> 00:58:58,868
It's so delicious. 

1625
00:58:58,868 --> 00:59:00,334
Every dish looks so good. 

1626
00:59:00,334 --> 00:59:01,501
It's spicy marinated crab. 

1627
00:59:01,501 --> 00:59:03,301
(There's nothing lacking) 

1628
00:59:03,301 --> 00:59:05,434
And there was something with clams. 

1629
00:59:05,434 --> 00:59:07,534
- Right. / - Where is it? 

1630
00:59:07,534 --> 00:59:08,801
- What's the finishing stroke? / - This is the best. 

1631
00:59:08,801 --> 00:59:10,868
- That's Manila clams, right? / - Oh, this. Yes. 

1632
00:59:11,268 --> 00:59:12,434
Did you order this separately? 

1633
00:59:12,434 --> 00:59:14,334
- No, it's included in the set. / - Isn't that $20? 

1634
00:59:14,334 --> 00:59:15,268
It's included in the meal set. 

1635
00:59:16,201 --> 00:59:18,434
- It's $8 per person. / - Manila clams are expensive. 

1636
00:59:18,434 --> 00:59:20,868
(It's the hidden menu with a clean taste) 

1637
00:59:24,501 --> 00:59:25,501
It's so cheap. 

1638
00:59:25,501 --> 00:59:26,234
Because you guys drank the day before, 

1639
00:59:26,234 --> 00:59:27,268
it must've been so good. 

1640
00:59:27,268 --> 00:59:29,568
- We drank for that. / - We don't like to drink normally. 

1641
00:59:29,568 --> 00:59:30,934
(They drank against their will to have that) 

1642
00:59:31,468 --> 00:59:34,834
The Manila clams look big. 

1643
00:59:34,834 --> 00:59:36,168
- They are chewy. / - They're big. 

1644
00:59:36,168 --> 00:59:37,668
- You're right. / - They are big. 

1645
00:59:37,668 --> 00:59:38,834
The soup must be so good. 

1646
00:59:43,401 --> 00:59:46,768
(They each have a taste) 

1647
00:59:47,734 --> 00:59:49,134
This is amazing. 

1648
00:59:49,134 --> 00:59:49,934
Isn't it good? 

1649
00:59:51,534 --> 00:59:52,868
- This is perfect after drinking. / - I know... 

1650
00:59:52,868 --> 00:59:55,634
Cheonsik very well. He's not faking. 

1651
00:59:55,634 --> 00:59:57,868
- Like a baby. / - After having a sip... 

1652
00:59:57,868 --> 01:00:00,668
- He seems like he wants to drink more. / - Exactly. 

1653
01:00:00,668 --> 01:00:02,601
(He takes another sip because he was so surprised) 

1654
01:00:04,834 --> 01:00:06,568
It's refreshing, right? 

1655
01:00:06,834 --> 01:00:09,701
(It's blissful) 

1656
01:00:10,434 --> 01:00:12,301
- It's pure. / - It's pure? 

1657
01:00:12,301 --> 01:00:15,601
It tastes like water and Manila clams. 

1658
01:00:15,601 --> 01:00:18,068
But how can it taste so smooth? 

1659
01:00:18,068 --> 01:00:19,134
(First time eating such a pure tasting clam soup) 

1660
01:00:19,134 --> 01:00:21,068
This is a meal on its own. 

1661
01:00:21,501 --> 01:00:24,068
- It's a meal. / - As you eat the side dishes... 

1662
01:00:24,068 --> 01:00:26,601
And then take a sip of the Manila clam soup... 

1663
01:00:26,601 --> 01:00:28,701
- It clears up everything. / - Yes, it clears it up. 

1664
01:00:28,701 --> 01:00:29,401
The surprising thing is that, 

1665
01:00:29,401 --> 01:00:30,968
you can choose the Manila clam soup, kimchi stew, 

1666
01:00:30,968 --> 01:00:33,234
bean paste stew or cutlassfish soup for the main dish. 

1667
01:00:33,234 --> 01:00:34,834
- I want to have everything. / - That's right. 

1668
01:00:34,834 --> 01:00:36,168
Kimchi stew will be good with that too. 

1669
01:00:36,801 --> 01:00:39,901
You can tell by the kimchi that it will be good. 

1670
01:00:39,901 --> 01:00:42,968
Actually, even a simple soup 

1671
01:00:42,968 --> 01:00:44,334
tastes different. 

1672
01:00:44,334 --> 01:00:46,568
It just tastes simple, honest, unsophisticated 

1673
01:00:46,568 --> 01:00:47,301
and original. 

1674
01:00:47,668 --> 01:00:50,568
If I could, I would take this out on the go. 

1675
01:00:50,568 --> 01:00:52,334
- The soup is so amazing. / - Really? 

1676
01:00:52,334 --> 01:00:54,768
(They want it by their side when they're hung-over) 

1677
01:00:54,768 --> 01:00:58,368
If you eat that when you're about to catch a cold, 

1678
01:00:58,368 --> 01:00:59,168
it will go away. 

1679
01:00:59,168 --> 01:01:01,068
- That's right. / - It's 100%. 

1680
01:01:01,068 --> 01:01:03,934
- Clam soup. / - $8 including the Manila clam soup? 

1681
01:01:03,934 --> 01:01:04,934
- That's right. / - $8 per person. 

1682
01:01:04,934 --> 01:01:06,134
It's unbelievably cheap. 

1683
01:01:06,134 --> 01:01:08,434
There's a reason why this is the main highlight. 

1684
01:01:08,434 --> 01:01:09,901
- Right? / - I agree. 

1685
01:01:09,901 --> 01:01:11,468
- It's completely right. / - It's completely right. 

1686
01:01:11,468 --> 01:01:12,901
- It feels so good. / - Yes. 

1687
01:01:12,901 --> 01:01:13,934
It really is. 

1688
01:01:14,568 --> 01:01:15,934
That place is amazing. 

1689
01:01:15,934 --> 01:01:17,434
They even gave me Manila clam soup 

1690
01:01:17,434 --> 01:01:18,834
when I went there by myself. 

1691
01:01:18,834 --> 01:01:20,401
Look at how much clams they give you! 

1692
01:01:20,401 --> 01:01:21,468
Even for a table for one. 

1693
01:01:21,768 --> 01:01:24,668
It's worth taking a train to here just to eat this. 

1694
01:01:24,668 --> 01:01:28,101
It couldn't get better than this for breakfast. 

1695
01:01:28,101 --> 01:01:30,401
- Is it that good? / - Is it that good? 

1696
01:01:30,401 --> 01:01:31,901
- Yes, I could go there. / - Is it that good? 

1697
01:01:31,901 --> 01:01:32,368
It's possible. 

1698
01:01:33,001 --> 01:01:34,734
I haven't cleared a bowl of rice like this before. 

1699
01:01:34,734 --> 01:01:37,334
I think it's the most I've ever had for breakfast. 

1700
01:01:37,334 --> 01:01:38,668
It was the biggest portion of rice that 

1701
01:01:38,668 --> 01:01:39,934
I've ever had for breakfast as an adult. 

1702
01:01:40,434 --> 01:01:41,601
I'm serious. 

1703
01:01:41,601 --> 01:01:43,534
Who eats breakfast with rice piled this high? 

1704
01:01:43,534 --> 01:01:44,268
They don't. 

1705
01:01:44,268 --> 01:01:45,834
It should be hard to eat a lot after 

1706
01:01:45,834 --> 01:01:47,301
you ate so much last night. 

1707
01:01:47,301 --> 01:01:48,968
I'll have to go there tomorrow. 

1708
01:01:48,968 --> 01:01:51,434
It's my first time seeing Hyunbo sweat while eating. 

1709
01:01:51,434 --> 01:01:54,334
There are so many dishes. 

1710
01:01:55,368 --> 01:01:57,201
Look at those Manila clams. 

1711
01:01:57,201 --> 01:01:58,801
- That really looks good. / - It must be good. 

1712
01:01:58,801 --> 01:02:01,168
- I want to go again. / - It's $8. 

1713
01:02:01,168 --> 01:02:02,534
It's amazing for $8. 

1714
01:02:02,834 --> 01:02:04,834
- It's $24 for 3 people. / - That's right. 

1715
01:02:04,834 --> 01:02:06,101
- I already set things up. / - Really? 

1716
01:02:06,101 --> 01:02:07,868
- Do we move? / - Should we go? 

1717
01:02:07,868 --> 01:02:10,034
- Thank you for the food. / - Thank you for the food. 

1718
01:02:10,034 --> 01:02:11,434
This was amazing. 

1719
01:02:11,834 --> 01:02:13,234
This is the first time that they're using their bodies. 

1720
01:02:14,301 --> 01:02:15,301
Come here. 

1721
01:02:15,301 --> 01:02:16,668
Look at how skinny he is before he left. 

1722
01:02:16,668 --> 01:02:18,201
Before he was on this trip. 

1723
01:02:18,201 --> 01:02:20,801
- She's so cute. / - Oh, my. 

1724
01:02:20,801 --> 01:02:23,568
- She's so big now. / - She's so pretty. 

1725
01:02:23,568 --> 01:02:25,234
Say, "Please show a lot of love for Battle Trip." 

1726
01:02:25,234 --> 01:02:27,801
- She's so pretty. / - She must look after her mom. 

1727
01:02:27,801 --> 01:02:29,768
Please show a lot of love for Battle Trip. 

1728
01:02:29,768 --> 01:02:31,368
- Smile. / - She's so cute. 

1729
01:02:32,268 --> 01:02:33,401
She's so cute. 

1730
01:02:34,134 --> 01:02:35,534
Zoom this in. 

1731
01:02:36,634 --> 01:02:39,968
- What is that? / - I had to look for some activities. 

1732
01:02:41,368 --> 01:02:42,601
A nightclub? 

1733
01:02:42,734 --> 01:02:46,201
- A nightclub? / - He's wary of his wife. 

1734
01:02:46,834 --> 01:02:48,334
Do they really have things like this? 

1735
01:02:48,334 --> 01:02:50,368
Both of them will like this. 

1736
01:02:50,701 --> 01:02:52,734
They don't like to move. 

1737
01:02:52,734 --> 01:02:54,834
We should drive around the sea in a convertible. 

1738
01:02:54,834 --> 01:02:56,168
- They will like it. / - A convertible. 

1739
01:02:56,168 --> 01:02:57,701
- Let's do this. / - In Mokpo? 

1740
01:02:58,534 --> 01:03:00,101
Cheonsik, you like cars, right? 

1741
01:03:00,101 --> 01:03:01,901
- I will really do. / - It's perfect for a coastal road. 

1742
01:03:01,901 --> 01:03:03,401
Junghun hates to move. 

1743
01:03:03,401 --> 01:03:04,668
(Driving a convertible on a coastal road) 

1744
01:03:04,668 --> 01:03:06,068
A convertible on a coastal road. 

1745
01:03:06,068 --> 01:03:07,201
That will be like art. 

1746
01:03:07,201 --> 01:03:09,301
- I just want the clam soup. / - Me too. 

1747
01:03:09,301 --> 01:03:11,568
- I feel like it. / - Where can you get it in Seoul? 

1748
01:03:11,568 --> 01:03:13,701
I suddenly became so hungry. 

1749
01:03:13,768 --> 01:03:15,768
- The reason I brought you here... / - Yes? 

1750
01:03:15,768 --> 01:03:17,068
ls because of the hidden card for activity. 

1751
01:03:19,234 --> 01:03:20,734
Are we finally doing something? 

1752
01:03:20,734 --> 01:03:22,034
I'm imitating you. 

1753
01:03:22,034 --> 01:03:24,634
At this sea that is spread in front of our eyes... 

1754
01:03:25,234 --> 01:03:28,401
We will drive around openly. 

1755
01:03:28,401 --> 01:03:29,934
- With what? / - A convertible? 

1756
01:03:29,934 --> 01:03:32,001
(Driving a convertible on a coastal road) 

1757
01:03:32,668 --> 01:03:35,034
- Yes. / - I have a bad feeling. 

1758
01:03:35,034 --> 01:03:37,034
- That can't be it. / - He won't make fun of us like this. 

1759
01:03:37,034 --> 01:03:38,434
That can't be it. 

1760
01:03:38,434 --> 01:03:40,134
Hyunbo, you should get in this. 

1761
01:03:40,701 --> 01:03:42,734
Junghun, get in the red one. 

1762
01:03:43,968 --> 01:03:45,668
What is this? 

1763
01:03:45,668 --> 01:03:47,734
How romantic is this? 

1764
01:03:48,934 --> 01:03:49,968
Is it really that? 

1765
01:03:49,968 --> 01:03:51,801
It was really that. 

1766
01:03:51,801 --> 01:03:54,034
(You can comfortably enjoy the coastal road) 

1767
01:03:54,034 --> 01:03:56,201
It's perfect for a date course. 

1768
01:03:57,201 --> 01:03:59,734
Those toy convertibles are for babies. 

1769
01:04:00,368 --> 01:04:03,568
- This is your activity? / - It was a really timid activity. 

1770
01:04:05,034 --> 01:04:06,568
I was joking earlier. 

1771
01:04:06,568 --> 01:04:08,768
The activities are this way. 

1772
01:04:08,768 --> 01:04:11,201
As you can see, there are bicycles and everything. 

1773
01:04:11,201 --> 01:04:13,001
Both of you should ride a tandem bicycle 

1774
01:04:13,001 --> 01:04:15,101
because Junghun only rides planes around the world. 

1775
01:04:15,101 --> 01:04:16,568
He's not that good at driving. 

1776
01:04:16,568 --> 01:04:18,234
- I can't drive. / - No, you can't. 

1777
01:04:18,768 --> 01:04:19,868
You need a driver's license for this. 

1778
01:04:19,868 --> 01:04:21,568
Do you need a driver's license? 

1779
01:04:22,134 --> 01:04:24,701
- Safety is important. / - Of course. 

1780
01:04:24,701 --> 01:04:26,168
You should always wear safety helmets. 

1781
01:04:26,168 --> 01:04:30,034
- Grab it like this. Be careful. / - Yes. 

1782
01:04:30,034 --> 01:04:31,401
(Electric bicycle, $15 for 30 minutes) 

1783
01:04:31,401 --> 01:04:33,001
- I prepared a lot, right? / - You prepared properly. 

1784
01:04:33,001 --> 01:04:34,734
I told you I prepared a lot. 

1785
01:04:36,134 --> 01:04:37,434
It feels good. 

1786
01:04:37,434 --> 01:04:38,668
(Let's go) 

1787
01:04:41,068 --> 01:04:45,368
(They finally show off their coolness) 

1788
01:04:45,368 --> 01:04:46,468
- What is that? / - What is that? 

1789
01:04:46,801 --> 01:04:47,868
(The studio is filled with laughter) 

1790
01:04:47,868 --> 01:04:49,768
I didn't feel good while I was riding that. 

1791
01:04:49,768 --> 01:04:51,901
It's not that nice. What is that? 

1792
01:04:51,901 --> 01:04:53,901
(What are they laughing at?) 

1793
01:04:58,434 --> 01:05:00,968
Only Cheonsik got to ride a cool bicycle. 

1794
01:05:01,968 --> 01:05:03,634
That's an electric bicycle too? 

1795
01:05:03,634 --> 01:05:05,734
Their back and belly are stuck together. 

1796
01:05:06,368 --> 01:05:07,534
They were. 

1797
01:05:07,934 --> 01:05:10,401
(Hahaha) 

1798
01:05:10,401 --> 01:05:12,001
What will you do with your hands? 

1799
01:05:12,001 --> 01:05:14,601
(Even they think that they look funny) 

1800
01:05:15,168 --> 01:05:17,034
How could you do this to me? 

1801
01:05:17,934 --> 01:05:18,768
They're cute. 

1802
01:05:18,768 --> 01:05:19,634
How is that cute? 

1803
01:05:19,634 --> 01:05:20,834
It looks like a tricycle. 

1804
01:05:20,834 --> 01:05:22,268
It looks really dirty. 

1805
01:05:22,801 --> 01:05:25,401
Are both of your hands really around his waist? 

1806
01:05:25,401 --> 01:05:28,568
I really didn't feel good at that moment. 

1807
01:05:28,568 --> 01:05:30,501
Did you bring me here to do this? 

1808
01:05:30,501 --> 01:05:31,768
I can't believe this. 

1809
01:05:32,568 --> 01:05:34,568
He's evil. 

1810
01:05:37,968 --> 01:05:42,468
(The cute tandem bicycle moves slowly) 

1811
01:05:45,168 --> 01:05:47,101
Mokpo is the best. 

1812
01:05:48,134 --> 01:05:50,201
Where would you drive along the coastal road like this? 

1813
01:05:50,201 --> 01:05:51,734
Only he rode the cool bicycle. 

1814
01:05:51,734 --> 01:05:54,101
Cheonsik, this is the maximum speed. 

1815
01:05:54,101 --> 01:05:55,301
(Hahaha) 

1816
01:05:55,301 --> 01:05:56,368
Is this the maximum speed? 

1817
01:05:56,368 --> 01:05:58,801
It feels like Junghun is pulling me from behind. 

1818
01:06:00,001 --> 01:06:01,301
Are you guys together? 

1819
01:06:02,001 --> 01:06:03,034
Are you guys together? 

1820
01:06:03,634 --> 01:06:06,768
(It's so funny that he can't speak) 

1821
01:06:06,768 --> 01:06:08,701
I'm scared. 

1822
01:06:10,268 --> 01:06:12,601
- That is the worst. / - What is he doing? 

1823
01:06:12,634 --> 01:06:14,634
- Gosh. / - It's so tragic. 

1824
01:06:14,634 --> 01:06:16,334
The person behind is bigger. 

1825
01:06:17,334 --> 01:06:19,768
I think I saw this in a cartoon. 

1826
01:06:20,301 --> 01:06:22,001
I'm scared. 

1827
01:06:22,001 --> 01:06:24,334
- I'm scared. / - Is this what you wanted? 

1828
01:06:24,334 --> 01:06:25,468
I'm scared. 

1829
01:06:25,468 --> 01:06:28,134
We came all the way to Mokpo to do this? 

1830
01:06:28,134 --> 01:06:31,768
- You can't sing ballads anymore. / - What is this? 

1831
01:06:31,768 --> 01:06:33,001
You think we're funny, right? 

1832
01:06:35,268 --> 01:06:37,168
Look at him running away because he's embarrassed. 

1833
01:06:37,168 --> 01:06:40,401
- I should get a girlfriend soon. / - They're too close. 

1834
01:06:40,401 --> 01:06:41,968
It's surprising that both of them could even fit. 

1835
01:06:41,968 --> 01:06:44,568
They didn't fit. They were crammed in there. 

1836
01:06:45,201 --> 01:06:46,501
It's quite fast. 

1837
01:06:46,501 --> 01:06:48,434
(They're still positive) 

1838
01:06:48,434 --> 01:06:50,834
- It feels cool. / - It feels cool. 

1839
01:06:51,434 --> 01:06:52,401
It feels cool. 

1840
01:06:52,401 --> 01:06:54,768
(The three of them are enjoying fall properly) 

1841
01:06:54,768 --> 01:06:56,001
It feels nice. 

1842
01:06:58,134 --> 01:06:59,368
It feels cool. 

1843
01:06:59,368 --> 01:07:00,501
(It feels cool) 

1844
01:07:00,501 --> 01:07:01,934
What is this? 

1845
01:07:04,368 --> 01:07:06,101
It's so funny. 

1846
01:07:06,101 --> 01:07:07,534
There's a really nice place here as well. 

1847
01:07:07,534 --> 01:07:09,701
- Are we going to walk? / - It's called Gatbawi. 

1848
01:07:10,301 --> 01:07:12,101
Can we air this? 

1849
01:07:12,101 --> 01:07:14,268
They enjoyed everything. 

1850
01:07:14,268 --> 01:07:15,834
It was so nice. I really liked it. 

1851
01:07:15,834 --> 01:07:17,068
- Here? / - It's here. 

1852
01:07:17,068 --> 01:07:20,201
- Gatbawi? / - Yes, it's Gatbawi. 

1853
01:07:21,168 --> 01:07:23,401
The rock looks like Buddhist monks wearing a gat. 

1854
01:07:23,401 --> 01:07:26,034
It's one of Mokpo's representative scenic spots. 

1855
01:07:26,034 --> 01:07:28,334
There's a footpath. 

1856
01:07:28,334 --> 01:07:30,368
If you go around it, you can see Gatbawi. 

1857
01:07:30,368 --> 01:07:32,168
If it rains a lot, the path gets submerged under water. 

1858
01:07:32,168 --> 01:07:33,701
It got cracked because of the sea water. 

1859
01:07:33,701 --> 01:07:34,801
(Mokpo's natural sculptures) 

1860
01:07:34,801 --> 01:07:36,734
- It's interesting. / - How is that possible? 

1861
01:07:36,734 --> 01:07:38,368
The waves come this way. 

1862
01:07:38,368 --> 01:07:40,101
Maybe that's how it was made. 

1863
01:07:40,401 --> 01:07:42,934
This is a natural masterpiece... 

1864
01:07:42,934 --> 01:07:45,034
- That represents Mokpo. / - A natural sculpture. 

1865
01:07:45,034 --> 01:07:46,568
You have to see this before you go. 

1866
01:07:46,568 --> 01:07:47,901
It looks like someone 

1867
01:07:47,901 --> 01:07:49,334
put a gat on the rocks on purpose. 

1868
01:07:49,334 --> 01:07:50,634
- But nature made this. / - That's right. 

1869
01:07:50,634 --> 01:07:52,601
- It's so interesting. / - Isn't it so interesting? 

1870
01:07:52,601 --> 01:07:56,968
- It was made from sea water and wind. / - Wind. 

1871
01:07:56,968 --> 01:07:58,801
And a long, long time. 

1872
01:07:58,801 --> 01:08:01,468
- It's a sculpture made by nature. / - That's right. 

1873
01:08:01,468 --> 01:08:02,668
Since we're here... 

1874
01:08:02,668 --> 01:08:04,734
Let's take a photo as this represents Mokpo. 

1875
01:08:05,234 --> 01:08:06,534
Let's go. 

1876
01:08:06,534 --> 01:08:08,434
1, 2, 3. 

1877
01:08:08,868 --> 01:08:12,968
(Let our friendship continue for a long time) 

1878
01:08:15,068 --> 01:08:21,401
(The sun sets as their Mokpo trip ends) 

1879
01:08:22,601 --> 01:08:25,234
(Rain is starting to fall gently) 

1880
01:08:25,234 --> 01:08:26,734
It's the last itinerary already. 

1881
01:08:26,734 --> 01:08:28,634
- It rained. / - It rained for us to drink. 

1882
01:08:28,634 --> 01:08:30,234
- The atmosphere is so amazing. / - That timing. 

1883
01:08:30,234 --> 01:08:31,734
- That's right. / - They want you to drink alcohol. 

1884
01:08:32,568 --> 01:08:34,601
I like parasols that are that color. 

1885
01:08:34,601 --> 01:08:36,001
The one with red, blue and yellow. 

1886
01:08:37,268 --> 01:08:40,468
It's already the last itinerary of our trip. 

1887
01:08:40,468 --> 01:08:42,868
- The weather can't make up its mind. / - Yeah. 

1888
01:08:42,868 --> 01:08:44,901
This trip was full of variety. 

1889
01:08:45,168 --> 01:08:46,634
It was rainy and sunny. 

1890
01:08:46,634 --> 01:08:50,134
I feel a little tired but we should keep this feeling... 

1891
01:08:50,134 --> 01:08:52,734
- To finish this trip beautifully... / - That's right. 

1892
01:08:52,734 --> 01:08:54,534
- With the last hidden card. / - Hidden view. 

1893
01:08:54,534 --> 01:08:55,868
- The weather is helping them. / - Yeah. 

1894
01:08:55,868 --> 01:08:57,901
They're not going to anywhere random. 

1895
01:08:58,834 --> 01:09:01,468
It was good for 3 men. How good will it be for lovers? 

1896
01:09:01,901 --> 01:09:03,401
This is so pretty. 

1897
01:09:03,401 --> 01:09:06,501
It's a cart bar where you can see... 

1898
01:09:06,501 --> 01:09:09,534
- Mokpo Bridge. / - Cart bars. 

1899
01:09:10,534 --> 01:09:13,568
- You don't have to go to Fukuoka. / - That's right. 

1900
01:09:13,568 --> 01:09:17,334
- The atmosphere is amazing. / - It's dreamy. 

1901
01:09:17,334 --> 01:09:19,401
It's a pity that three men are here together. 

1902
01:09:20,101 --> 01:09:21,368
It's so pretty. 

1903
01:09:21,368 --> 01:09:22,534
Rain was gently falling, 

1904
01:09:22,534 --> 01:09:24,368
so a dreamy atmosphere was created. 

1905
01:09:24,368 --> 01:09:25,368
It made it even prettier. 

1906
01:09:25,368 --> 01:09:27,334
Let's have a last drink while watching... 

1907
01:09:27,334 --> 01:09:30,634
- The pretty panorama. / - Let's do that. 

1908
01:09:30,634 --> 01:09:32,201
Let's end our trip. 

1909
01:09:32,668 --> 01:09:34,901
I'm 100% confident that if we make Kangnam choose 

1910
01:09:34,901 --> 01:09:37,834
between Danyang and Mokpo, he will choose Mokpo. 

1911
01:09:38,301 --> 01:09:39,968
Kangnam, just come this way. 

1912
01:09:39,968 --> 01:09:41,634
- Is he betraying his father? / - Yes. 

1913
01:09:41,634 --> 01:09:43,768
Danyang is the place that made you gain weight. 

1914
01:09:43,768 --> 01:09:45,001
That's right. 

1915
01:09:45,601 --> 01:09:47,668
(It's popular during chilly fall) 

1916
01:09:47,668 --> 01:09:49,768
(Spicy fish roe soup, $22) 

1917
01:09:51,134 --> 01:09:52,768
- It's small octopus. / - Raw octopus. 

1918
01:09:53,268 --> 01:09:54,668
Small octopus is good during fall. 

1919
01:09:54,668 --> 01:09:57,301
- Fall small octopus is good. / - They sell that there? 

1920
01:09:57,301 --> 01:09:59,934
Small octopus is a health food. 

1921
01:09:59,934 --> 01:10:01,334
(Food that go well with cart bar) 

1922
01:10:02,601 --> 01:10:05,734
Mokpo small octopus tastes amazing. 

1923
01:10:05,734 --> 01:10:07,534
How could you eat so much? 

1924
01:10:07,534 --> 01:10:09,034
- You should eat bit by bit. / - It was stuck together. 

1925
01:10:09,034 --> 01:10:11,034
- It was so strong. / - I want to drink alcohol. 

1926
01:10:11,034 --> 01:10:12,768
There's a reason why he doesn't have a girlfriend. 

1927
01:10:14,168 --> 01:10:15,534
- Nilriri Manbo. / - Nilriri Manbo. 

1928
01:10:15,534 --> 01:10:17,634
(You can't leave alcohol out from an occasion like this) 

1929
01:10:17,634 --> 01:10:19,834
(They empty it right away) 

1930
01:10:19,834 --> 01:10:21,301
Old men always drink bottoms up. 

1931
01:10:21,301 --> 01:10:23,301
It's like soda. 

1932
01:10:24,934 --> 01:10:27,168
Before the trip, we promised each other 

1933
01:10:27,168 --> 01:10:30,201
that we would eat 1 meal every 3 steps. 

1934
01:10:30,201 --> 01:10:32,101
We promised 10,000 steps. 

1935
01:10:32,101 --> 01:10:34,468
- Let's see how many steps we took. / - Finally. 

1936
01:10:35,101 --> 01:10:37,168
3, 2, 0. 

1937
01:10:37,168 --> 01:10:38,001
(How many steps did they make?) 

1938
01:10:38,001 --> 01:10:41,068
10,649 steps. 

1939
01:10:41,068 --> 01:10:42,134
(They successfully walked more than 10,000 steps) 

1940
01:10:42,134 --> 01:10:45,001
- We did it. / - We made 10,648 steps. 

1941
01:10:45,801 --> 01:10:48,201
Even if we ate that much... 

1942
01:10:48,201 --> 01:10:50,968
We barely made it. 

1943
01:10:50,968 --> 01:10:53,101
We are just punks, right? 

1944
01:10:53,301 --> 01:10:54,801
We exceeded that number 

1945
01:10:54,801 --> 01:10:55,701
even though we ate so much. 

1946
01:10:55,701 --> 01:10:58,068
You could drink alcohol endlessly there. 

1947
01:10:58,068 --> 01:11:00,134
- It's so pretty. / - The air is clean. 

1948
01:11:01,201 --> 01:11:02,201
The view is nice... 

1949
01:11:02,201 --> 01:11:04,201
- And it's raining. / - Perfect for the finale. 

1950
01:11:04,201 --> 01:11:05,734
- It's like a movie. / - This is so nice. 

1951
01:11:05,734 --> 01:11:07,568
I think to go to a cart bar for the last is nice. 

1952
01:11:07,568 --> 01:11:09,134
- I think it's nice. / - Yes. 

1953
01:11:09,134 --> 01:11:11,901
The mix of the sea and the lighting from the bridge. 

1954
01:11:12,234 --> 01:11:14,368
You won't get drunk if you drink by the sea. 

1955
01:11:14,368 --> 01:11:16,301
If Sikyung was there with them... 

1956
01:11:16,301 --> 01:11:17,834
- It would've been perfect. / - It would've. 

1957
01:11:18,034 --> 01:11:20,434
- It appeals to your senses. / - That's right. 

1958
01:11:20,434 --> 01:11:23,268
It's tasteful and it feels so nice since it's raining. 

1959
01:11:23,268 --> 01:11:26,934
Look. Night, rain, bridge, alcohol. 

1960
01:11:26,934 --> 01:11:28,334
What more do we need? 

1961
01:11:29,568 --> 01:11:32,368
(Impressed) 

1962
01:11:32,368 --> 01:11:33,834
He looks so cool. 

1963
01:11:34,634 --> 01:11:36,101
Your face looks so small. 

1964
01:11:36,468 --> 01:11:40,834
- That's so cool. / - That's a photo of a lifetime. 

1965
01:11:42,201 --> 01:11:43,734
My background is the sea. 

1966
01:11:43,734 --> 01:11:46,801
My background is the night view of Mokpo. 

1967
01:11:46,801 --> 01:11:51,134
(They become very sensitive) 

1968
01:11:52,134 --> 01:11:53,268
(They are completely immersed in the amazing view) 

1969
01:11:53,268 --> 01:11:54,768
Didn't they shoot Junghun? 

1970
01:11:55,201 --> 01:11:57,801
I took them there but how could they not shoot me? 

1971
01:11:58,034 --> 01:11:59,334
How could they do that? 

1972
01:11:59,334 --> 01:12:01,368
He was even waiting for it. 

1973
01:12:01,368 --> 01:12:02,668
- What happened? / - He really waited for it. 

1974
01:12:02,668 --> 01:12:04,401
- They shot it... / - Yes. 

1975
01:12:04,401 --> 01:12:08,434
But the producer said, "Let's edit it out." 

1976
01:12:08,768 --> 01:12:10,601
He was looking forward to the end so much. 

1977
01:12:10,601 --> 01:12:12,468
(They are completely immersed in the amazing view) 

1978
01:12:12,468 --> 01:12:13,601
1 night and 2 days can be 

1979
01:12:13,601 --> 01:12:15,468
very short depending on the way you look at it. 

1980
01:12:15,468 --> 01:12:17,334
- We didn't drive. / - That's right. 

1981
01:12:17,334 --> 01:12:18,501
We moved by train 

1982
01:12:18,501 --> 01:12:20,068
and we could take our time looking around. 

1983
01:12:20,068 --> 01:12:22,834
We had a beer during lunch yesterday too. It was nice. 

1984
01:12:24,734 --> 01:12:28,834
We had Junghun as a hidden card. 

1985
01:12:28,834 --> 01:12:30,568
- That's right. / - He researched for everything. 

1986
01:12:30,568 --> 01:12:33,034
A trip for three men is really cool. 

1987
01:12:33,034 --> 01:12:36,268
Junghun's been to 70 countries around the world. 

1988
01:12:36,268 --> 01:12:39,434
So I thought he wouldn't know much about Korea. 

1989
01:12:39,434 --> 01:12:41,201
- I was mistaken. / - This was not good. 

1990
01:12:41,201 --> 01:12:42,434
This was a mistake. 

1991
01:12:42,434 --> 01:12:44,834
I can hear the votes dropping. 

1992
01:12:44,834 --> 01:12:46,901
- He did a really good job... / - That's right. 

1993
01:12:46,901 --> 01:12:48,001
As a hidden card. 

1994
01:12:50,568 --> 01:12:53,001
- Let's chant for the last time. / - Okay. 

1995
01:12:53,001 --> 01:12:54,768
- Say cheers... / - Okay. 

1996
01:12:54,768 --> 01:12:56,701
- And go back to Seoul. / - Alright. 

1997
01:12:56,701 --> 01:12:59,968
Our trip reintroduced Mokpo for Battle Trip. 

1998
01:12:59,968 --> 01:13:01,834
Nilriri Manbo! 

1999
01:13:03,568 --> 01:13:05,201
- Cheers. / - Good job. 

2000
01:13:05,201 --> 01:13:06,268
It was really enjoyable. 

2001
01:13:07,301 --> 01:13:08,234
(Nilriri Manbo, the end of their Mokpo trip) 

2002
01:13:08,234 --> 01:13:11,534
- The end was amazing. / - Thank you. 

2003
01:13:15,701 --> 01:13:17,534
- Okay. / - Oh, my. 

2004
01:13:18,234 --> 01:13:19,668
- It was nice. / - Yes. 

2005
01:13:19,668 --> 01:13:21,168
We ate a lot. 

2006
01:13:21,168 --> 01:13:22,568
- That's right. / - If you had to choose one. 

2007
01:13:22,568 --> 01:13:24,568
What would you eat? 

2008
01:13:24,568 --> 01:13:25,668
- The meal? / - I want the short rib patty. 

2009
01:13:25,668 --> 01:13:27,568
- The short rib patty? / - The short rib patty? 

2010
01:13:28,001 --> 01:13:30,634
It was the first time I ever had a texture like that. 

2011
01:13:30,634 --> 01:13:32,134
- The short rib patty. / - Yes, the short rib patty. 

2012
01:13:32,134 --> 01:13:34,034
It was a real hidden card. 

2013
01:13:34,034 --> 01:13:35,734
- The meal. / - The $8 meal? 

2014
01:13:35,734 --> 01:13:37,434
- Yes, the $8 meal. / - That was the best. 

2015
01:13:37,434 --> 01:13:39,068
- It was the best. / - It had the clam soup. 

2016
01:13:39,068 --> 01:13:41,568
I want to eat noodles in soybean soup so much. 

2017
01:13:41,568 --> 01:13:43,301
I want to eat the rice cake dessert. 

2018
01:13:43,301 --> 01:13:44,834
- That was good. / - The mugwort rice cake. 

2019
01:13:44,834 --> 01:13:46,468
I want noodles in soybean soup. 

2020
01:13:46,468 --> 01:13:48,268
- Every single meal was good. / - What would you do? 

2021
01:13:48,268 --> 01:13:49,434
Noodles in soybean soup delivered all over the country. 

2022
01:13:49,434 --> 01:13:51,134
I really want to tell you this. 

2023
01:13:51,301 --> 01:13:52,701
This isn't the end. 

2024
01:13:52,701 --> 01:13:54,401
If you go to Mokpo, 

2025
01:13:54,401 --> 01:13:56,001
there's a place that does good beef bone soup. 

2026
01:13:56,001 --> 01:13:58,168
- Beef bone soup? / - There's a place that's sold... 

2027
01:13:58,168 --> 01:14:00,901
Only dumplings and instant noodles for 20 years. 

2028
01:14:01,301 --> 01:14:03,801
The most famous croaker restaurant in Korea 

2029
01:14:03,801 --> 01:14:04,601
is in Mokpo. 

2030
01:14:04,601 --> 01:14:06,568
I usually don't say this 

2031
01:14:06,568 --> 01:14:10,168
but I think you should empty your mind today. 

2032
01:14:11,101 --> 01:14:13,168
So, how much did they spend? 

2033
01:14:13,168 --> 01:14:15,001
- They must've spent heaps. / - Too much. 

2034
01:14:15,168 --> 01:14:18,134
For the 2 days and 1 night in Mokpo... 

2035
01:14:18,134 --> 01:14:19,768
- The Nilriri Manbo Tour spent... / - The total. 

2036
01:14:19,768 --> 01:14:21,268
- Per person. / - Per person! 

2037
01:14:21,268 --> 01:14:22,601
- A total of... / - Total. 

2038
01:14:23,368 --> 01:14:27,434
$179.20. 

2039
01:14:27,934 --> 01:14:29,834
- They were three though. / - After all that eating? 

2040
01:14:29,834 --> 01:14:30,968
That's right. 

2041
01:14:30,968 --> 01:14:32,001
We accept that. 

2042
01:14:32,001 --> 01:14:33,568
Okay, any last words? 

2043
01:14:33,568 --> 01:14:34,934
Mothers, you were all busy, right? 

2044
01:14:34,934 --> 01:14:37,334
What is he doing? 

2045
01:14:37,334 --> 01:14:39,368
You must have been busy. 

2046
01:14:39,368 --> 01:14:40,901
Escape your busy daily lives. 

2047
01:14:40,901 --> 01:14:42,534
Put your steering wheels down... 

2048
01:14:42,534 --> 01:14:43,934
And you should also get a drink during the day. 

2049
01:14:43,934 --> 01:14:46,634
You can walk slowly to the place your feet leads you. 

2050
01:14:46,634 --> 01:14:48,834
- Enjoy the beauty of nature. / - Oh, he's good. 

2051
01:14:48,834 --> 01:14:50,368
I think it will be nice. Order automatically. 

2052
01:14:50,368 --> 01:14:52,634
(Order automatically) 

2053
01:14:52,634 --> 01:14:53,901
- Automatic order. / - Automatic order. 

2054
01:14:54,334 --> 01:14:55,501
You're ready to vote, right? 

2055
01:14:55,501 --> 01:14:57,901
Would you like to go on a trip 

2056
01:14:57,901 --> 01:15:00,501
according to Nilriri Manbo Tour's plan to Mokpo? 

2057
01:15:00,501 --> 01:15:01,501
(Would you go to Mokpo according to their plan?) 

2058
01:15:02,634 --> 01:15:05,968
(They designed a domestic fall trip to Mokpo) 

2059
01:15:05,968 --> 01:15:08,668
(What will the judges choose?) 

2060
01:15:09,768 --> 01:15:13,201
Will it be Peak Father and Son Tour to Danyang? 

2061
01:15:13,201 --> 01:15:15,601
Or Nilriri Manbo Tour to Mokpo? 

2062
01:15:15,601 --> 01:15:18,301
What will the judges choose? 

2063
01:15:21,768 --> 01:15:24,734
- Mr. Noh. / - This is nerve wrecking. 

2064
01:15:24,734 --> 01:15:27,201
- He was too strong. / - I hate you, Mr. Noh. 

2065
01:15:27,201 --> 01:15:28,368
Mr. Noh was too good. 

2066
01:15:28,368 --> 01:15:29,568
We had spicy mandarin fish stew. 

2067
01:15:29,568 --> 01:15:30,868
Our trip was also nice. 

2068
01:15:30,868 --> 01:15:34,201
- What is it? The last digit's a zero. / - Please... 

2069
01:15:34,201 --> 01:15:34,868
(The last digit is revealed first) 

2070
01:15:34,868 --> 01:15:35,334
Three. 

2071
01:15:35,934 --> 01:15:37,401
We won the last digit. 

2072
01:15:37,401 --> 01:15:38,401
(Which team will win?) 

2073
01:15:38,401 --> 01:15:42,068
Did we win or lose? 

2074
01:15:47,534 --> 01:15:49,701
(Mokpo won) 

2075
01:15:49,701 --> 01:15:51,834
- Congratulations. / - That was amazing. 

2076
01:15:52,101 --> 01:15:53,801
- That was amazing. / - Thank you. 

2077
01:15:53,801 --> 01:15:56,101
- Did we win? / - They won. 

2078
01:15:56,834 --> 01:15:58,801
- That's a lot of votes. / - They tied in 11th place. 

2079
01:15:58,801 --> 01:16:00,701
(Mokpo tied in 11th place for the most votes ever) 

2080
01:16:00,701 --> 01:16:03,734
First, in 6 months, to be in 90s range. 

2081
01:16:03,734 --> 01:16:06,434
- It's a really rare thing. / - Yes. 

2082
01:16:06,434 --> 01:16:07,601
- Wow. / - That's so fortunate. 

2083
01:16:07,601 --> 01:16:08,868
Please tell us your thoughts. 

2084
01:16:08,868 --> 01:16:11,701
I think it will be nice 

2085
01:16:11,701 --> 01:16:13,601
if you go on a trip to Mokpo. 

2086
01:16:13,601 --> 01:16:17,101
A lot of people have only heard about Mokpo. 

2087
01:16:17,101 --> 01:16:18,801
- They think it's further than it is. / - That's right. 

2088
01:16:18,801 --> 01:16:20,301
It's closer than we think 

2089
01:16:20,301 --> 01:16:21,868
and there's a lot more good food than you think. 

2090
01:16:21,868 --> 01:16:23,334
It's really perfect for fall. 

2091
01:16:23,334 --> 01:16:25,368
I hope many of you go to Mokpo. 

2092
01:16:25,368 --> 01:16:27,068
- Okay. / - I see. 

2093
01:16:27,068 --> 01:16:28,401
Kim Hwan, you were with us for 2 weeks. 

2094
01:16:28,401 --> 01:16:29,168
How was it? 

2095
01:16:29,168 --> 01:16:32,601
- My daughter is only 7 months old. / - That's right. 

2096
01:16:32,601 --> 01:16:33,801
I want to take her out but 

2097
01:16:33,801 --> 01:16:36,101
I didn't know where to take her. 

2098
01:16:36,101 --> 01:16:37,668
- We saw two trips in Korea. / - That's right. 

2099
01:16:37,668 --> 01:16:40,368
Danyang and Mokpo are on my list now. 

2100
01:16:40,368 --> 01:16:42,968
- I really want to go there. / - You should really go. 

2101
01:16:42,968 --> 01:16:44,668
I also want to go to Mokpo. 

2102
01:16:44,668 --> 01:16:46,134
Stop it now. 

2103
01:16:46,134 --> 01:16:48,201
Right? 

2104
01:16:48,201 --> 01:16:49,634
- It's 91 votes now. / - That's right. 

2105
01:16:49,634 --> 01:16:51,934
Is next week also a special? 

2106
01:16:51,934 --> 01:16:53,368
Of course, it's a special. 

2107
01:16:53,368 --> 01:16:56,434
Next week. "You're really going there?" 

2108
01:16:56,434 --> 01:16:57,668
"Where is that place?" 

2109
01:16:57,668 --> 01:17:00,368
It's a surprising location that will make you say that. 

2110
01:17:00,368 --> 01:17:02,801
- "There? Really?" / - Is it a new location? 

2111
01:17:02,801 --> 01:17:05,234
We will come back next week. 

2112
01:17:05,234 --> 01:17:07,001
The world is your school. Life is a journey. 

2113
01:17:07,001 --> 01:17:09,534
Battle Trip! 

2114
01:17:13,101 --> 01:17:14,501
(Next episode) 

2115
01:17:14,768 --> 01:17:18,201
I've chosen all the must-visit landmarks 

2116
01:17:18,201 --> 01:17:21,168
of Bandung. 

2117
01:17:21,168 --> 01:17:25,168
Men and women of all ages will enjoy this place. 

2118
01:17:25,168 --> 01:17:28,068
Have a Bandung day! 

2119
01:17:28,068 --> 01:17:30,301
Bye. 

2120
01:17:30,301 --> 01:17:34,334
Sakhalin! Yeonwoo, this is Sakhalin. 

2121
01:17:35,101 --> 01:17:37,868
I'm overwhelmed by the beauty of this place. 

2122
01:17:37,868 --> 01:17:38,601
Yeah. 

2123
01:17:38,601 --> 01:17:42,534
- I'm scared. / - No, no! 

2124
01:17:42,534 --> 01:17:45,534
Screaming together and not caring about anyone else. 

2125
01:17:45,534 --> 01:17:46,668
I think that was so nice. 

2126
01:17:46,668 --> 01:17:50,201
(Battle Trip)
