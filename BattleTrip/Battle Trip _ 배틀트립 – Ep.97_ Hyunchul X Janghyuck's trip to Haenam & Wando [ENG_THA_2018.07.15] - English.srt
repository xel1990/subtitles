00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:02,540
(Naples of the East, Tongyeong and Yokjido)

2
00:00:02,540 --> 00:00:03,640
Let's go!

3
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:07,274
One Day Three Meals Tour!

4
00:00:07,274 --> 00:00:08,507
Let's ride!

5
00:00:10,674 --> 00:00:12,007
This is cool.

6
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:17,007
- This is fun. / - Rock, paper, scissors.

7
00:00:17,007 --> 00:00:18,907
(The trip for middle-aged men)

8
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:21,540
There's so much to eat. It's lined up.

9
00:00:23,407 --> 00:00:24,574
It's delicious.

10
00:00:26,207 --> 00:00:27,374
It feels good, right?

11
00:00:28,707 --> 00:00:29,840
(Who will be the winning team?)

12
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:34,540
(Numerous great tips on trips)

13
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:37,974
(Park Jeongcheol, Kim Seungsoo)

14
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:40,274
(Kim Hyunchul, Cho Janghyuck)

15
00:00:41,074 --> 00:00:42,707
(Lee Hwijae, special host, Kim Saerom)

16
00:00:43,107 --> 00:00:44,274
Travel is war.

17
00:00:44,274 --> 00:00:46,507
Battle Trip!

18
00:00:47,974 --> 00:00:49,640
We had a break last week.

19
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:51,307
We're back with the planners

20
00:00:51,307 --> 00:00:53,540
for the domestic island trips.

21
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:55,540
That's right. They're here.

22
00:00:55,540 --> 00:00:58,174
We have our 100 impartial judges

23
00:00:58,174 --> 00:01:00,540
who will vote on today's trips.

24
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:01,607
Welcome.

25
00:01:02,207 --> 00:01:04,174
(The team with the most votes wins)

26
00:01:04,174 --> 00:01:06,540
We've prepared a lot for this week.

27
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:08,307
- Right. / - The seniors are finally going on a trip?

28
00:01:08,307 --> 00:01:08,707
- Yes. / - Right.

29
00:01:08,707 --> 00:01:11,740
They've waited for 3 weeks.

30
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:14,974
They are going to Haenam and Wando.

31
00:01:14,974 --> 00:01:17,607
You'll see what it's like.

32
00:01:17,607 --> 00:01:21,440
The thing is we're the analog generation.

33
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:24,207
We started traveling when there was

34
00:01:24,207 --> 00:01:26,807
no internet or smart phones, not even beepers.

35
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:28,807
You used to carry maps, right?

36
00:01:28,807 --> 00:01:30,407
Maybe that's why I'm good with maps.

37
00:01:30,407 --> 00:01:32,240
- That's right. We used actual maps back then. / - Map?

38
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:34,440
You don't know it. Every car used to have a directory.

39
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:35,140
Me too.

40
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:36,774
- Directory of the entire country. / - There was no GPS.

41
00:01:36,774 --> 00:01:39,940
- An actual map? / - You had to carry a map.

42
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:41,407
The route numbers.

43
00:01:41,407 --> 00:01:42,740
We'd write down numbers.

44
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:45,107
And you'd always get the directions wrong.

45
00:01:45,107 --> 00:01:47,374
The country was developing rapidly back then.

46
00:01:47,374 --> 00:01:49,340
The roads were always under construction or blocked.

47
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:51,807
So you'd drive along and be like, "Where's the road?"

48
00:01:51,807 --> 00:01:54,040
- We didn't have cell phones either. / - But these days...

49
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:57,040
It's so easy to go on a trip.

50
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:01,040
We have the KTX and we have GPS.

51
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,540
You just have to get yourself there.

52
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:04,407
We can go on a trip whenever we want these days.

53
00:02:04,407 --> 00:02:07,407
I doubt your trip was that much analog, right?

54
00:02:07,407 --> 00:02:08,574
- Not that much. / - We captured that feeling.

55
00:02:08,574 --> 00:02:10,374
We traveled with that analog feeling.

56
00:02:10,374 --> 00:02:12,507
As we grow older,

57
00:02:12,507 --> 00:02:14,307
we become more sedentary.

58
00:02:14,307 --> 00:02:16,707
When we were young, we were very active.

59
00:02:16,707 --> 00:02:19,107
We wanted to visit as many places as possible.

60
00:02:19,107 --> 00:02:21,274
But now, we just like to visit some place

61
00:02:21,274 --> 00:02:24,340
and sit there and enjoy the scenery.

62
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:26,607
- We get energy from it. / - That's nice...

63
00:02:26,607 --> 00:02:28,040
But you can't do that on our show.

64
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:30,974
But there's a lot going on in the stillness.

65
00:02:31,707 --> 00:02:33,740
I'm sure your organs were moving.

66
00:02:34,174 --> 00:02:36,040
It's like internal movement.

67
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:39,174
If your trip is too sedentary,

68
00:02:39,174 --> 00:02:40,574
we might get bored.

69
00:02:40,574 --> 00:02:43,040
In fact, Wando is a slow city.

70
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,507
- A slow city? / - Yes.

71
00:02:44,507 --> 00:02:48,907
There are specific criteria for slow cities.

72
00:02:48,907 --> 00:02:53,007
They should produce and consume organic foods.

73
00:02:53,007 --> 00:02:55,907
The population has to be less than 50,000.

74
00:02:55,907 --> 00:02:57,040
- Really? / - There are certain conditions.

75
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,907
- And the environment. / - It should develop slowly.

76
00:02:58,907 --> 00:03:01,407
They have certain criteria

77
00:03:01,407 --> 00:03:03,540
about the environment, culture and arts.

78
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:05,640
It has to meet the criteria...

79
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:07,774
- To be selected as a slow city. / - That's right.

80
00:03:07,774 --> 00:03:08,874
And Wando is a slow city.

81
00:03:08,874 --> 00:03:10,607
Albert taught me that once.

82
00:03:10,607 --> 00:03:11,607
- Right. / - Really?

83
00:03:11,607 --> 00:03:14,740
So Haenam and Wando are internationally recognized

84
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:16,940
as slow cities for relaxing.

85
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:19,407
Let's go on a trip to those cities now.

86
00:03:19,407 --> 00:03:20,740
Please take a look at the map.

87
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:22,074
Let's check the map.

88
00:03:22,074 --> 00:03:23,840
Haenam and Wando are...

89
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,540
- It's on the left. / - In Korea... That's right.

90
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:27,707
They are located on the southern tip of the peninsula.

91
00:03:27,707 --> 00:03:30,174
There are a lot of islands around the cities.

92
00:03:30,174 --> 00:03:33,740
People say it's the end of the country.

93
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:36,274
But we realized something when we went there.

94
00:03:36,274 --> 00:03:37,940
It's actually the beginning of the peninsula.

95
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:39,274
That sounds about right.

96
00:03:39,274 --> 00:03:40,674
That's the beginning.

97
00:03:40,674 --> 00:03:44,007
And the country stretches out to the north.

98
00:03:44,774 --> 00:03:47,574
That's the difference we found.

99
00:03:47,574 --> 00:03:50,140
Since they are slow cities,

100
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:52,340
you can think about many things there.

101
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:54,140
- That's right. / - You get that vibe.

102
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:56,307
So it's Haenam and Wando.

103
00:03:56,307 --> 00:03:57,440
I expect they discovered a lot about the places

104
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:59,307
since they enjoy food.

105
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:01,807
Actually, I love delicious foods.

106
00:04:01,807 --> 00:04:03,907
- He's an epicure. / - Right.

107
00:04:03,907 --> 00:04:07,440
So we enjoyed a lot of the traditional food of Jeolla-do,

108
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:09,374
and we had health food on the second day.

109
00:04:09,374 --> 00:04:10,740
It's perfect for our age group.

110
00:04:11,574 --> 00:04:13,774
Wando is famous for abalone.

111
00:04:13,774 --> 00:04:14,940
- Abalone? / - Of course.

112
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:18,240
We ate abalone until we almost burst.

113
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:19,774
They worry because the price of abalone

114
00:04:19,774 --> 00:04:21,340
is declining these days.

115
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:23,674
- So we should eat a lot of it. / - That's right.

116
00:04:23,674 --> 00:04:26,107
I'm sure our team will win

117
00:04:26,107 --> 00:04:27,607
because we have our ace in the hole.

118
00:04:29,007 --> 00:04:31,007
- We got some tips. / - Isn't it against the rule?

119
00:04:31,007 --> 00:04:33,340
We met Lee Useok, a travel journalist.

120
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:38,374
He knows all the good restaurants around Korea.

121
00:04:38,374 --> 00:04:39,607
He knows good restaurants.

122
00:04:39,607 --> 00:04:41,407
He even knows the address of these places.

123
00:04:41,407 --> 00:04:42,707
He's on "Wednesday Food Talk."

124
00:04:42,707 --> 00:04:44,940
- We got tips from him. / - We got good tips.

125
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:49,107
But it's unfair that you got help from a specialist.

126
00:04:49,107 --> 00:04:50,507
It's not against the law though.

127
00:04:50,507 --> 00:04:51,974
Battle Trip is open to things like this.

128
00:04:51,974 --> 00:04:53,974
- Now we talk about the law? / - Just relax.

129
00:04:53,974 --> 00:04:55,340
Don't worry about it.

130
00:04:55,407 --> 00:04:56,974
Alright then.

131
00:04:56,974 --> 00:04:58,940
When it comes to Jeollanam-do,

132
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:01,074
you can't really go against it with food.

133
00:05:01,074 --> 00:05:02,374
That's right. It's so good.

134
00:05:02,374 --> 00:05:03,540
I'm very confident.

135
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:07,140
We can't lose to mackerel and sweet potato.

136
00:05:08,907 --> 00:05:09,974
Alright.

137
00:05:09,974 --> 00:05:11,840
Please tell us your tour name.

138
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:14,740
Our tour name? He came up with it.

139
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:15,974
Why Travel Together Tour.

140
00:05:15,974 --> 00:05:17,340
- What? / - Why Travel Together Tour.

141
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:19,674
Why are we traveling together?

142
00:05:20,907 --> 00:05:22,607
Why on earth are we traveling together?

143
00:05:22,607 --> 00:05:24,574
- Goodness... / - This could be a problem.

144
00:05:24,574 --> 00:05:26,507
- That's a terrible name. / - We've won.

145
00:05:26,507 --> 00:05:29,140
- They didn't want to go together. / - Our trip...

146
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:31,474
Is about figuring that question out.

147
00:05:31,474 --> 00:05:32,574
You'll see what I mean.

148
00:05:32,574 --> 00:05:33,407
A trip to Haenam and Wando.

149
00:05:33,407 --> 00:05:34,874
Why Are We Traveling Together Tour.

150
00:05:34,874 --> 00:05:36,974
- Why Travel... / - Why Travel Together Tour.

151
00:05:36,974 --> 00:05:37,974
Why Travel Together Tour.

152
00:05:37,974 --> 00:05:39,307
I'm concerned about this.

153
00:05:39,307 --> 00:05:40,907
Let's watch the Why Travel Together Tour.

154
00:05:40,907 --> 00:05:43,174
(Their trip to Haenam and Wando begins)

155
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:46,940
(The blue ocean and hundreds of islands)

156
00:05:48,874 --> 00:05:50,840
Goodness.

157
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:52,574
(Wando, a smiling island)

158
00:05:53,274 --> 00:05:54,807
(Why are we traveling together?)

159
00:05:55,774 --> 00:05:57,107
(The experts invigorate themselves)

160
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:01,707
What's this? What led to that scene?

161
00:06:01,707 --> 00:06:03,540
You'll see soon enough.

162
00:06:03,874 --> 00:06:05,074
(An authentic Jeolla-do meal)

163
00:06:05,074 --> 00:06:06,474
It already looks delicious.

164
00:06:06,474 --> 00:06:08,974
(Abalone that you can only taste in Wando)

165
00:06:09,874 --> 00:06:11,207
Wow!

166
00:06:11,474 --> 00:06:13,240
That was the ultimate health food.

167
00:06:15,374 --> 00:06:18,774
(Gourmet tour of domestic islands)

168
00:06:18,774 --> 00:06:20,507
- You had marinated crab? / - You bet.

169
00:06:20,507 --> 00:06:21,540
My gosh.

170
00:06:22,407 --> 00:06:24,140
(11:30 a.m., a cafe in Sangam)

171
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:28,407
(The trip designer is enjoying a warm cup of tea)

172
00:06:29,374 --> 00:06:32,307
(The composer and singer of "Addicted Love")

173
00:06:32,307 --> 00:06:34,040
Why are they playing that all of a sudden?

174
00:06:35,807 --> 00:06:36,940
He looks younger now.

175
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:38,574
That's the analog generation.

176
00:06:38,774 --> 00:06:40,507
(He knows all about fishing)

177
00:06:40,507 --> 00:06:42,840
This is aspartame.

178
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:44,140
That's a mugwort tree.

179
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:45,674
Hey, that's not it!

180
00:06:45,674 --> 00:06:47,007
Hey, hey, hey.

181
00:06:47,007 --> 00:06:49,174
You're like a carnivore, you fool.

182
00:06:49,174 --> 00:06:51,574
You make me nag like a mom.

183
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,374
He was so young.

184
00:06:53,707 --> 00:06:55,007
How long ago was that?

185
00:06:55,307 --> 00:06:57,340
It must be at least 20 years ago.

186
00:06:57,340 --> 00:06:59,974
(Cho Janghyuck, a walking, nagging encyclopedia)

187
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:04,240
Geez.

188
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:06,940
(His travel companion hasn't arrived yet)

189
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:09,107
I told him so many times not to act entitled.

190
00:07:11,674 --> 00:07:13,007
I was born in early 1973.

191
00:07:14,074 --> 00:07:16,974
- So he's younger than I am. / - My goodness.

192
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:19,374
I was born in February, and he was born in May.

193
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:22,174
- He can only brag about his age. / - 3 months.

194
00:07:22,174 --> 00:07:24,340
He says he was born in early 1973.

195
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:26,774
I entered college in 1987, he did in 1988.

196
00:07:26,774 --> 00:07:30,240
If we had met at school, I'd be his senior.

197
00:07:31,107 --> 00:07:33,874
But if you become friends, it messes up your circles.

198
00:07:33,874 --> 00:07:35,874
- It's already messed up. / - We don't care these days.

199
00:07:35,874 --> 00:07:37,207
We just decided to be friends.

200
00:07:38,374 --> 00:07:41,174
- Come in quickly. / - The traffic jam was terrible.

201
00:07:41,907 --> 00:07:44,274
I had to cross the border from another city.

202
00:07:44,674 --> 00:07:46,240
- The border from another city? / - My gosh.

203
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,274
You live in Bundang. Don't exaggerate.

204
00:07:48,274 --> 00:07:51,240
- I told you to be punctual. / - Okay, I got it.

207
00:08:00,507 --> 00:08:02,607
What on earth is that?

208
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:07,107
Alcohol? Alcohol?

209
00:08:07,874 --> 00:08:10,074
- He seems genuinely happy. / - He's cute.

210
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:16,040
He looks so different now.

211
00:08:16,407 --> 00:08:18,407

I can't believe I'm traveling with you.

00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:23,907
Same here.

215
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:30,307
But the thing is that Battle Trip initially invited me.

216
00:08:30,607 --> 00:08:32,207
I was meant to go abroad but couldn't schedule it...

217
00:08:32,207 --> 00:08:33,907
You should've gone abroad.

218
00:08:33,907 --> 00:08:35,607
Since I host a radio show,

219
00:08:35,607 --> 00:08:37,474
I couldn't work out a schedule.

220
00:08:37,474 --> 00:08:40,974
But this time, I made the time because

221
00:08:40,974 --> 00:08:42,207
it's a domestic island special.

222
00:08:43,907 --> 00:08:45,807
Will we fish in that island?

223
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:48,974
- No, it's not about fishing. / - He loves to fish, right?

224
00:08:48,974 --> 00:08:51,974
There's a new road for bicycles.

225
00:08:51,974 --> 00:08:53,740
- He likes biking. / - It's been newly built.

226
00:08:54,974 --> 00:08:56,040
- So... / - You want to go biking?

227
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:58,940
Biking could be a good idea.

228
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:01,074
- They don't seem compatible. / - No, they don't.

229
00:09:01,074 --> 00:09:03,440
I like biking, and you like fishing.

230
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,474
We can't do either one?

231
00:09:04,474 --> 00:09:05,907
We must eat.

232
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:10,207
- You're an epicure. / - I'm the expert. Epicure?

233
00:09:10,207 --> 00:09:12,074
I'm a glutton first.

234
00:09:12,907 --> 00:09:16,940
I like to eat seafood and meat.

235
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:18,640
You do like seafood.

236
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:21,240
I'd jump to my feet if I can eat seafood.

237
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:24,607
On the south coast. And the Jeollanam-do region...

238
00:09:24,607 --> 00:09:26,574
I love seafood too.

239
00:09:26,574 --> 00:09:28,207
On top of that,

240
00:09:28,207 --> 00:09:31,174
that's the area with the most clustered islands.

241
00:09:31,174 --> 00:09:32,840
Which island do you want to visit?

242
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:34,107
I don't care.

243
00:09:34,107 --> 00:09:36,207
I just want to go somewhere with a lot of good food.

244
00:09:36,207 --> 00:09:41,674
Alright. I know this journalist.

245
00:09:41,674 --> 00:09:43,207
- Who is it? / - He's a friend.

246
00:09:43,207 --> 00:09:46,707
He's a regular guest on my radio show.

247
00:09:46,707 --> 00:09:48,540
- His name is Lee Useok. / - Oh, him?

248
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:50,774
- Right, right. / - Useok?

249
00:09:50,774 --> 00:09:54,074
- Welcome, welcome. / - Hello.

250
00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:58,140
- That's him! / - Lee Useok.

251
00:09:58,140 --> 00:09:59,174
Right.

252
00:09:59,607 --> 00:10:04,907
We'll go to islands in Jeollanam-do.

253
00:10:04,907 --> 00:10:06,707
- That's all we decided so far. / - An island.

254
00:10:06,707 --> 00:10:09,040
We haven't chosen which island.

255
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:10,574
We don't know much about islands.

256
00:10:10,574 --> 00:10:13,740
- But we want to eat seafood. / - Okay.

257
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:15,140
Both of us love seafood.

258
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:17,907
Yeosu has about 400 islands.

259
00:10:17,907 --> 00:10:20,740
And you know the regions that are just islands?

260
00:10:21,374 --> 00:10:24,007
- Wando. Jindo. / - Wando?

261
00:10:24,007 --> 00:10:26,174
Nowadays, there are connecting bridges.

262
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:28,407
How about going to Wando to eat abalone?

263
00:10:28,407 --> 00:10:30,574
Wando is known for great abalone.

264
00:10:32,707 --> 00:10:34,740
It produces 80% of abalone in Korea?

265
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:36,940
The color of the ocean is great.

266
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:38,074
That's amazing.

267
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:42,407
- I'd love abalone in Wando. / - They're huge.

268
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:44,207
- That's the place of origin. / - You're right.

269
00:10:44,207 --> 00:10:47,807
It doesn't compare to the fresh abalone in Seoul.

270
00:10:47,807 --> 00:10:50,540
This is the place of origin that provides an experience.

271
00:10:51,207 --> 00:10:54,307
What do you experience? Harvesting them?

272
00:10:54,307 --> 00:10:56,174
That's right. You pick them yourself and eat them.

273
00:10:57,374 --> 00:10:59,940
There's an island called Nohwado in Wando.

274
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:03,207
You can pick the abalone and eat them.

275
00:11:03,207 --> 00:11:06,707
It's slightly cheaper too, and you can trust its origin.

276
00:11:06,707 --> 00:11:08,207
And it's fresh too.

277
00:11:09,674 --> 00:11:12,374
- Let's go to Wando. / - That's what we decided.

278
00:11:12,374 --> 00:11:13,507
We decided on Wando, right?

279
00:11:13,507 --> 00:11:15,140
You must visit Wando.

280
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:17,907
What else does Wando have besides abalone?

281
00:11:17,907 --> 00:11:20,674
Wando is most famous for abalone.

282
00:11:20,674 --> 00:11:22,107
If you've gone all the way there...

283
00:11:22,107 --> 00:11:25,574
It'll be summer soon. You need to eat health food.

284
00:11:25,574 --> 00:11:26,974
Health food!

285
00:11:26,974 --> 00:11:29,940
Do you know what pike eels are?

286
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:31,407
- Eels from the sea. / - Of course, I know.

287
00:11:31,407 --> 00:11:33,740
- Pike eels. / - I love pike eels.

288
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:36,007
- Pike eels. / - There's a pike eel stew.

289
00:11:36,007 --> 00:11:37,307
Look at that.

290
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:40,107
And there are scorpion fish too.

291
00:11:40,107 --> 00:11:42,440
- Scorpion fish? / - I know what it is.

292
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:44,107
It's incredibly delicious.

293
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:46,574
And you cannot miss this out.

294
00:11:46,574 --> 00:11:49,007
- Cuttlefish, best type of squid. / - The cuttlefish.

295
00:11:49,007 --> 00:11:50,074
Cuttlefish.

296
00:11:50,074 --> 00:11:54,807
- That's delicious. / - They'll be out of season soon.

297
00:11:54,807 --> 00:11:56,974
Cuttlefish is really delicious.

298
00:11:56,974 --> 00:11:59,574
So abalone, scorpion fish.

299
00:11:59,574 --> 00:12:02,074
- And... / - Pike eel.

300
00:12:02,074 --> 00:12:03,440
- That's fresh. / - And cuttlefish.

301
00:12:03,707 --> 00:12:06,174
If we can just eat all that...

302
00:12:06,174 --> 00:12:06,940
We're going there to eat.

303
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:09,407
- This is such a great lineup. / - Of course.

304
00:12:09,807 --> 00:12:11,940
- It's the Avengers. / - Yes, it is.

305
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:15,007
- Avengers. Iron Man. / - What a great lineup.

306
00:12:16,174 --> 00:12:17,907
Wherever I travel to, food is the most important part.

307
00:12:17,907 --> 00:12:20,240
If we're going to eat all this food...

308
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,740
I don't know what our opposing team will eat.

309
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:25,440
- They'll be so jealous. / - I doubt they can compete.

310
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:27,007
Thank you for your help.

311
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:28,640
- Thank you for your advice. / - Eat a lot.

312
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:30,074
- We will. / - We will eat a lot.

313
00:12:30,074 --> 00:12:31,240
- I'll leave now. / - Bye.

314
00:12:32,574 --> 00:12:35,307
If they study like that first, they'll have to win.

315
00:12:35,307 --> 00:12:39,140
When people go to Wando for abalone,

316
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:40,074
they'll get their money's worth.

317
00:12:40,074 --> 00:12:44,174
We'll be eating abalone from the place of origin.

318
00:12:44,174 --> 00:12:47,640
That's right. It sounds like a food paradise.

319
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:49,107
I feel like I'll gain weight.

320
00:12:49,107 --> 00:12:52,640
- You must wear loose pants there. / - Exactly.

321
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:54,840
- So the pants can stretch. / - So they can stretch.

322
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,774
He always unbuttons his pants.

323
00:12:57,507 --> 00:13:00,340
To go to Wando,

324
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:02,407
we have to pass Haenam, Ttangkkeut.

325
00:13:02,407 --> 00:13:05,340
- It's on our way to Wando. / - Right.

326
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:10,407
First off, it takes around 4 to 6 hours.

327
00:13:10,407 --> 00:13:11,440
It takes a long time.

328
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,774
Let's head out at dawn. We'll leave at dawn.

329
00:13:13,774 --> 00:13:18,640
We have to come up with our tour name.

330
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:23,007
We must come up with one.

331
00:13:24,807 --> 00:13:26,274
Why are we traveling together?

332
00:13:27,407 --> 00:13:28,440
What?

333
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,574
- Why are we traveling together? / - For food.

334
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:35,540
If we actually find an answer to that question...

335
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:37,740
- That'd be... / - We're going for the answer.

336
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:39,274
So why did we travel together on this trip?

337
00:13:39,274 --> 00:13:40,474
It's a question mark for now.

338
00:13:40,474 --> 00:13:43,107
But later on, it will become an exclamation mark.

339
00:13:43,107 --> 00:13:45,774
- The question mark will straighten out. / - Curious.

340
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:47,807
Why are we traveling together?

341
00:13:50,307 --> 00:13:52,240
Why are we traveling together?

342
00:13:55,907 --> 00:13:57,407
Why are we traveling together?

At 4 a.m.

350
00:14:09,774 --> 00:14:11,374
- Hey. / - Hey. Come here.

351
00:14:11,974 --> 00:14:14,207
- Hey. / - Good work getting here.

352
00:14:14,207 --> 00:14:17,074
- Sorry, I'm late. / - I'll load this...

353
00:14:17,074 --> 00:14:19,040
(The "younger" Hyunchul does all the hard work)

354
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:21,907
Will we have fun on our trip?

355
00:14:21,907 --> 00:14:24,307
We must find out why we're traveling together.

356
00:14:24,307 --> 00:14:25,474
Yeah.

357
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:27,774
Okay...

358
00:14:28,474 --> 00:14:29,974
Let's go.

359
00:14:29,974 --> 00:14:31,674
- Let's head out. / - Okay.

360
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:36,874
Let's get going.

361
00:14:38,474 --> 00:14:40,007
Let's go.

362
00:14:40,607 --> 00:14:44,340
We're actually doing this.

363
00:14:44,707 --> 00:14:47,040
- It took a long time. / - Wow.

364
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:48,274
5 hours.

365
00:14:48,274 --> 00:14:50,674
So you arrived around the morning.

366
00:14:50,674 --> 00:14:51,640
(Ttangkkeut, the edge)

367
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:56,274
(The start of the end of Korea, Haenam)

368
00:14:59,074 --> 00:15:01,107
I can see the ocean.

369
00:15:01,107 --> 00:15:03,140
It's green on this side.

370
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:05,540
And it's the ocean on this side.

371
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:07,840
- It feels refreshing. / - How beautiful.

372
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:10,407
Jeolla-do and Gyeongsang-do are different.

373
00:15:10,807 --> 00:15:14,907
We set out at dawn. We must at least see the end.

374
00:15:14,907 --> 00:15:17,174
Let's drive to the end.

375
00:15:17,174 --> 00:15:19,407
Look at him. The elders always have their hand

376
00:15:19,407 --> 00:15:22,107
on the stick even when they drive an automatic.

377
00:15:22,107 --> 00:15:24,574
- I didn't know. / - Even with automatic transmission.

378
00:15:24,574 --> 00:15:26,274
He's from the manual transmission era.

379
00:15:26,274 --> 00:15:28,140
- Since he learned to drive with a stick. / - Right.

380
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:30,207
Back then, they only had manual transmission.

381
00:15:30,207 --> 00:15:32,940
- He leaves his hand there. / - When I drive...

382
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:33,740
(Janghyuck will buy breakfast)

383
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:36,407
There's a traditional Korean restaurant here.

384
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:39,907
I think they have a breakfast menu.

385
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:41,740
There's a separate menu for breakfast.

386
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:43,940
I think it costs about $10.

387
00:15:44,207 --> 00:15:45,540
Jeolla-do Korean meal.

388
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:48,407
- Is this it? / - Yeah, this is it.

389
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:51,474
They have a breakfast meal.

390
00:15:51,474 --> 00:15:53,040
It's written there.

391
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:53,907
I love restaurants that serve breakfast.

392
00:15:53,907 --> 00:15:56,207
That's a heavy meal for breakfast.

393
00:15:56,207 --> 00:15:57,840
That's the standard spread.

394
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:00,074
- The breakfast was great. / - Indeed, it is.

395
00:16:00,074 --> 00:16:01,474
It's nice and neat.

396
00:16:01,474 --> 00:16:03,140
With Jeolla-do spreads, there are

397
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:05,374
the mustard leaf kimchi and the seasoned vegetables.

398
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:09,307
Every dish was delicious. Everything there was good.

399
00:16:10,407 --> 00:16:17,340
(The unique taste of Jeolla-do home cooking)

400
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:19,740
- Salted fish. / - Is that soy sauce marinated crab?

401
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:21,507
Soy sauce marinated crabs.

402
00:16:21,507 --> 00:16:24,040
It's a side dish for breakfast?

403
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:25,674
- That's right. / - That's right.

404
00:16:27,407 --> 00:16:28,807
- Look at that. / - Stone pot rice.

405
00:16:28,807 --> 00:16:31,174
- There's hijikia in the rice. / - That's really delicious.

406
00:16:31,807 --> 00:16:34,207
- Marinated crabs. / - What a breakfast.

407
00:16:34,207 --> 00:16:35,840
Marinated crabs for breakfast?

408
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:40,740
(A meal with 13 side dishes at a reasonable price)

409
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:42,374
I think Jeolla-do food is just like that.

410
00:16:42,374 --> 00:16:43,907
That looks good.

411
00:16:43,907 --> 00:16:46,940
They serve breakfast from 8 to 11 a.m.

412
00:16:47,307 --> 00:16:50,174
We're going to have the stone pot meal.

413
00:16:50,374 --> 00:16:52,074
That's the breakfast.

414
00:16:52,174 --> 00:16:54,074
- That's only $10? / - Only $10?

415
00:16:54,074 --> 00:16:55,207
- That's cheap. / - That's amazing.

416
00:16:55,207 --> 00:16:57,040
I see the crocks in the back there.

417
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:58,274
I can tell this place is good now.

418
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:00,440
It means that they make their own paste.

419
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:01,707
Yes, they probably do.

420
00:17:02,174 --> 00:17:04,474
I'm looking forward to it. I'm hungry too.

421
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:06,974
(It should be served right about now)

422
00:17:06,974 --> 00:17:09,440
Right here. Thank you.

423
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:12,607
We were hungry.

424
00:17:13,707 --> 00:17:16,040
- Seasoned vegetables. / - Look at that.

425
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:19,407
You're sitting like a mermaid.

426
00:17:19,607 --> 00:17:21,774
You know people that can't sit cross-legged.

427
00:17:22,374 --> 00:17:23,774
He has a bad back.

428
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:28,174
My gosh, you're giving us a lot.

429
00:17:29,607 --> 00:17:31,407
Are you speaking in Jeolla-do dialect?

430
00:17:34,274 --> 00:17:35,640
Thank you.

431
00:17:36,274 --> 00:17:38,174
- The crabs. / - The crabs look delicious.

432
00:17:38,174 --> 00:17:40,507
- That's rock crab. / - Marinated crab is delicious.

433
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:43,640
With Jeollanam-do food, it's all about the side dishes.

434
00:17:44,007 --> 00:17:45,274
Even the anchovies are fresh.

435
00:17:45,274 --> 00:17:46,474
Even anchovies taste good there.

436
00:17:46,474 --> 00:17:48,374
The anchovy is alive when it's been fried.

437
00:17:48,374 --> 00:17:51,307
It's like they fried it live. Even though it's dried.

438
00:17:51,707 --> 00:17:54,274
- And I love how cheap it is. / - The dried laver.

439
00:17:54,274 --> 00:17:55,707
- That's Wando laver? / - That's pickled dried laver.

440
00:17:55,707 --> 00:17:57,407
- Pickled in soy sauce. / - That's pickled dried laver.

441
00:17:57,407 --> 00:17:59,540
They pickled dried lavers?

442
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:01,440
It's so good. Really good.

443
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,140
This is probably the pickled dried laver.

444
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:07,374
(The main dish is served next)

445
00:18:07,874 --> 00:18:11,140
- I'm hungry. / - Rice in a hot pot is the best.

446
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:13,640
- What's that? / - Braised mackerel with aged kimchi.

447
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:15,207
- Aged kimchi? / - What's this?

448
00:18:15,207 --> 00:18:16,640
This is bean paste soup.

449
00:18:16,907 --> 00:18:19,574
- All this costs $10? / - That's so cheap.

450
00:18:19,574 --> 00:18:21,007
All of this.

451
00:18:21,007 --> 00:18:23,274
- So this meal for two costs $20? / - Yes.

452
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:26,674
That's like a full dinner.

453
00:18:26,674 --> 00:18:28,274
I'll have a taste.

454
00:18:28,274 --> 00:18:30,740
- But that's only $10. / - $10 per person.

455
00:18:32,374 --> 00:18:34,840
All that on a meal for $10...

456
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:36,407
They even have hijikia.

457
00:18:36,407 --> 00:18:37,574
They even have jujubes and pumpkin.

458
00:18:37,574 --> 00:18:39,474
The rice by itself would be good.

459
00:18:39,474 --> 00:18:41,340
That was amazing.

460
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:44,307
The Jeolla-do stone pot rice is amazing.

461
00:18:45,074 --> 00:18:46,674
I'm about to cry.

462
00:18:46,874 --> 00:18:50,240
- It's like there's oil on it. / - You're right.

463
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:52,307
I do this...

464
00:18:52,307 --> 00:18:53,007
You have to pour the water.

465
00:18:53,007 --> 00:18:54,574
I pour some water in it, right?

466
00:18:56,874 --> 00:18:58,807
(What?)

467
00:18:59,074 --> 00:19:01,040
You're supposed to pour the hot water!

468
00:19:01,674 --> 00:19:02,540
That's cold water?

469
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:04,940
Hey, it's not that water!

470
00:19:05,374 --> 00:19:07,374
- What's this? / - Hey.

471
00:19:07,907 --> 00:19:09,174
Is this your first time having stone pot rice?

472
00:19:09,174 --> 00:19:10,940
No. Oh, it's here.

473
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:13,940
We have hot water. Why use the cold water?

474
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:17,507
- Goodness. Unbelievable. / - Let me pour it for you.

475
00:19:18,574 --> 00:19:21,040
- Let me pour it for you. / - It's still good like that.

476
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:23,007
- It's not bad. / - Because the stone is hot.

477
00:19:23,007 --> 00:19:25,974
For breakfast, pour cold water.

478
00:19:27,107 --> 00:19:29,074
That matches the time.

479
00:19:29,374 --> 00:19:30,774
Let's eat.

480
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:35,174
- Try the rice. / - The rice itself must be good.

481
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:37,040
After traveling for 6 hours...

482
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:39,874
- Did he just have 3 spoonfuls? / - He's only eating rice.

483
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:42,140
Did you just have 3 spoonfuls?

484
00:19:42,507 --> 00:19:44,340
I had 2 bowls of rice.

485
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:46,540
(Driving must've been tough for Hyunchul)

486
00:19:47,907 --> 00:19:49,040
Try this.

487
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:51,140
(Eat up, friend)

488
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:52,440
Have this.

489
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:54,607
It's delicious in a different way...

490
00:19:54,607 --> 00:19:57,140
When you eat from the place of origin.

491
00:19:57,574 --> 00:19:58,974
That's the difference.

492
00:20:01,674 --> 00:20:04,307
(It's delicious when you mix rice with the crab)

493
00:20:04,307 --> 00:20:06,440
- My gosh. / - Goodness.

494
00:20:07,407 --> 00:20:09,274
- Eat up. / - Nice and neat.

495
00:20:09,874 --> 00:20:15,274
(Just eating rice again)

496
00:20:15,274 --> 00:20:18,874
That rice tastes good just with the soy sauce.

497
00:20:19,507 --> 00:20:20,540
There you go!

498
00:20:22,807 --> 00:20:24,940
We shouldn't throw out this soy sauce.

499
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:29,374
I'll mix rice with it.

500
00:20:29,374 --> 00:20:33,874
(Mix the sauce and the innards with the rice well)

501
00:20:33,874 --> 00:20:40,607
(A spoonful of the rice makes him happy)

502
00:20:40,607 --> 00:20:43,140
- It gets rid of all your fatigue. / - It's so good.

503
00:20:44,174 --> 00:20:46,940
Huh? Oh?

504
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:49,540
It's so good, I don't have time to say it's good.

505
00:20:50,707 --> 00:20:53,840
(Saying how delicious it is would be a waste of time)

506
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:55,940
- This tastes really good. / - Mix it.

507
00:20:56,107 --> 00:20:58,307
I didn't see his wriggling toes.

508
00:20:58,407 --> 00:21:00,607
(He had no idea about this while traveling)

509
00:21:01,674 --> 00:21:03,574
This is 100% about the taste of kimchi.

510
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:05,874
Jeollanam-do is famous for its kimchi.

511
00:21:07,007 --> 00:21:09,074
- Gosh, the kimchi. / - Look at the color.

512
00:21:09,074 --> 00:21:09,874
Jeolla-do kimchi!

513
00:21:09,874 --> 00:21:10,707
- Jeolla-do kimchi... / - It's the best.

514
00:21:10,707 --> 00:21:12,507
The color looks appetizing.

515
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:15,307
I must choose a long strip.

516
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:17,940
Get a spoonful of the rice.

517
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:19,074
Scoop up some rice.

518
00:21:20,174 --> 00:21:22,340
- It can't be bad with that color. / - That's how you eat.

519
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:25,207
- Put the kimchi on top of rice. / - Right, right.

520
00:21:25,207 --> 00:21:27,674
To Koreans, rice is medicine.

521
00:21:29,407 --> 00:21:33,940
(Time to feast)

522
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:38,774
It's so good.

523
00:21:39,174 --> 00:21:41,674
If it's that delicious, you can't speak.

524
00:21:41,674 --> 00:21:43,140
- You can't talk if it's good. / - Right.

525
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:45,574
I really eat as if the food is good.

526
00:21:45,574 --> 00:21:46,940
(Slurp)

527
00:21:48,507 --> 00:21:49,707
This is the best.

528
00:21:50,207 --> 00:21:52,240
This is 100% the flavor of the kimchi.

529
00:21:52,474 --> 00:21:54,707
Since we had it, we know how it tastes.

530
00:21:54,707 --> 00:21:56,074
I'm really getting hungry.

531
00:21:56,074 --> 00:21:57,274
I'm getting hungry.

532
00:21:57,340 --> 00:22:00,307
(The result of eating with relish)

533

534
00:22:01,607 --> 00:22:03,007
- You must've been hungry. / - Yes.

535
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:04,474
(Cleared)

536
00:22:04,474 --> 00:22:08,374
I have to figure out why we're traveling together.

537
00:22:08,374 --> 00:22:10,540
It's the Why Are We Traveling Together Tour.

538
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:14,840
Now that I've had this breakfast,

539
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:16,474
I'm glad I came with you.

540
00:22:16,474 --> 00:22:18,274
And I'm glad I came with you.

541
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:22,574
I think I've found a small reason to travel together.

542
00:22:22,574 --> 00:22:24,807
But this isn't everything.

543
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:30,940
This place is full of food. There's so much food here.

544
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:34,940
The first meal was awesome.

545
00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:37,407
The scorched rice water.

546
00:22:37,407 --> 00:22:39,840
- That was awesome. / - You must finish with that.

547
00:22:40,307 --> 00:22:42,240
When you drink something warm at the end,

548
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:43,740
it warms up your insides.

549
00:22:44,974 --> 00:22:46,907
(They set to the dock to head to Nohwado)

550
00:22:46,907 --> 00:22:48,840
- We'll take the ferry there. / - Yes, right.

551
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:50,307
(End of the Peninsula to Bogildo)

552
00:22:50,307 --> 00:22:52,274
By the way, it's quite windy.

553
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:55,807
- The flag is fluttering hard. / - It's so windy.

554
00:22:55,974 --> 00:22:57,474
It's no joke.

555
00:22:58,874 --> 00:23:00,807
The ferry... It was really windy that day.

556
00:23:00,807 --> 00:23:02,074
Goodness.

557
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:08,074
My goodness.

558
00:23:08,074 --> 00:23:10,807
(They arrive at the dock)

559
00:23:10,807 --> 00:23:12,207
That's the ferry.

560
00:23:16,307 --> 00:23:24,674
(As they arrive at the ocean, the wind gets stronger)

561
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:28,107
This ferry goes to Bogildo and Nohwado.

562
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:30,640
That's how it is but...

563
00:23:34,107 --> 00:23:35,574
There's so much wind today.

564
00:23:39,307 --> 00:23:43,440
(Will they be able to take the ferry?)

565
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:45,574
This is where they sell the tickets.

566
00:23:46,274 --> 00:23:48,074
- It's closed. / - It's closed.

567
00:23:48,207 --> 00:23:49,474
- It's closed. / - Hey, come here.

568
00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:52,840
"All ferries are suspended due to bad weather."

569
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:54,374
- All ferries? / - My gosh.

570
00:23:54,674 --> 00:23:57,707
- What a shame. / - East, south and Jeju-do...

571
00:23:57,707 --> 00:23:59,807
Is on a high seas warning.

572
00:23:59,807 --> 00:24:04,274
The waves are 4m to 6m high.

573
00:24:04,274 --> 00:24:06,007
That was such a shame.

574
00:24:06,007 --> 00:24:07,440
We just needed to take a ferry.

575
00:24:08,907 --> 00:24:10,507
(All ships must stop and evacuate)

576
00:24:10,507 --> 00:24:11,740
It says you have to evacuate.

577
00:24:13,774 --> 00:24:15,340
I guess they won't be sailing all day.

578
00:24:16,507 --> 00:24:18,107
- Why does it have to be today? / - Then...

579
00:24:18,107 --> 00:24:19,507
That was such a shame.

580
00:24:19,507 --> 00:24:21,340
I don't think they're sailing.

581
00:24:22,974 --> 00:24:25,240
The wind stopped the ferries.

582
00:24:27,174 --> 00:24:32,440
Sing us a song to express this disappointment.

583
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:35,240
(He wants Janghyuck to sing a song now?)

584
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:37,607
(He complies with the request)

585
00:24:37,607 --> 00:24:38,640
Right?

586
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,740

588
00:24:45,374 --> 00:24:46,174
You're coughing.

(These middle-aged men don't lose their cool)

590
00:24:49,274 --> 00:24:51,574
- The color of the sky is pretty. / - Right.

00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:54,740
- You almost fell, right? / - Yes.

592
00:24:55,074 --> 00:24:56,674
- He staggered a little. / - It could've been really bad.

593
00:24:56,674 --> 00:24:59,107
- He didn't see the step. / - My gosh.

594
00:24:59,107 --> 00:25:01,707
I was going to listen to the sad boat horn and go.

595

It's cold.

598
00:25:09,707 --> 00:25:11,707
- Let's take a photo at least. / - What a shame.

599
00:25:12,140 --> 00:25:13,374
- Hyunchul. / - Yes?

600
00:25:13,374 --> 00:25:15,340
Since we're here, shouldn't we take a photo?

601
00:25:15,340 --> 00:25:17,840
- With what? With this? / - Or with this?

602
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:21,707

- It was. / - Such a shame.

609
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:36,874
- Let's... / - Let's ask the local experts.

610
00:25:36,874 --> 00:25:39,574
- Let's ask. / - Since they're locals.

611
00:25:39,574 --> 00:25:42,440
They'll tell us the answers.

612
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:43,540
Okay.

613
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:46,074
What a shame.

614
00:25:46,807 --> 00:25:47,974
- Let's go. / - Let's get going.

615
00:25:49,774 --> 00:25:51,207
Geez.

616
00:25:52,307 --> 00:25:54,140
Why is it so windy?

617
00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:55,874
So you gave up on picking abalone?

618
00:25:55,974 --> 00:25:57,040
Yes, we did.

619

- You gave up? / - No harvesting.

620
00:25:58,207 --> 00:26:00,107
We just ate what was harvested by others.

621
00:26:00,107 --> 00:26:01,840
We just focused on eating.

622
00:26:04,807 --> 00:26:06,874
Is it because we're near the ocean?

623
00:26:06,874 --> 00:26:09,440
- The weather is so unpredictable. / - It is.

We should talk to them over there.

That's the staff entrance.

00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:39,207

- Hello. / - Look at him act like nothing happened.

638
00:26:43,340 --> 00:26:46,040
- He makes me worried. / - He's such an old person.

639
00:26:46,774 --> 00:26:49,307
This is our first time traveling in Wando.

640
00:26:49,307 --> 00:26:50,407
We're now in Haenam, not Wando.

641
00:26:50,407 --> 00:26:51,840
- Right, Haenam. / - We're in Haenam.

642
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:55,207
We wanted to go to Nohwado.

643
00:26:55,207 --> 00:26:56,474
But the ferries aren't sailing today.

644
00:26:56,474 --> 00:26:58,074
We got some recommendations from the locals.

645
00:26:58,074 --> 00:27:00,107
Do you have any places you can recommend for us?

646
00:27:00,507 --> 00:27:02,940

Drinking?

650
00:27:08,107 --> 00:27:10,140
- "Drinking?" / - How many types did he just say that?

651
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:11,274
Drinking?

652
00:27:11,274 --> 00:27:16,174
(50, the perfect age to appreciate alcohol)

653
00:27:16,507 --> 00:27:18,774
- A distillery? / - Or you can go here.

00:27:18,974 --> 00:27:21,440
- Go here? / - The Duryunsan tourist site...

655
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:23,840
Is a nice place.

656
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:26,040
- It's cold, so... / - I'd love to visit the distillery.

657
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:30,974
So this is the famous alcohol in Haenam, right?

658
00:27:30,974 --> 00:27:33,007
The place has a great view as well.

659
00:27:33,007 --> 00:27:36,607
The alcohol is made with glutinous rice.

660
00:27:37,207 --> 00:27:38,874
You shouldn't miss a place like that.

661
00:27:38,874 --> 00:27:41,307
- That looks delicious. / - It looks so thick.

662
00:27:41,307 --> 00:27:41,640
Looks nice, right?

- Yes, please. / - Yes. Thank you.

667

What a nice view.

672
00:28:03,374 --> 00:28:05,974
I wonder what the traditional alcohol tastes like.

673

I'm really looking forward to it.

674
00:28:09,140 --> 00:28:11,907
- I think it'll taste unique. / - It'll be unique.

675
00:28:12,340 --> 00:28:15,707
I'll look up traditional Haenam liquor.

Of course. I'm a search expert.

678
00:28:21,107 --> 00:28:23,174
It's mainly made with glutinous rice.

679
00:28:23,174 --> 00:28:24,940
- Glutinous rice. / - And...

680
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:27,240
- It must be thick then. / - Exactly.

681
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:31,340

Yes, yes.

00:29:23,674 --> 00:29:25,740
It's been 92 years.

705
00:29:26,074 --> 00:29:28,907
- 92 years? / - 92 years.

706
00:29:28,907 --> 00:29:31,440
We brew the alcohol

707
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:33,540
with organic glutinous rice from the local farms.

708
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:35,674
It has unique taste from the glutinous rice.

709
00:29:35,674 --> 00:29:37,240
It's not just rice. It's glutinous rice.

710
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:38,540
Organic glutinous rice.

711
00:29:38,540 --> 00:29:41,540
You play songs on tape here?

712
00:29:42,474 --> 00:29:44,874
Isn't that really old?

713
00:29:44,874 --> 00:29:46,807
That's because...

714
00:29:46,807 --> 00:29:48,540
When we make alcohol,

715
00:29:48,540 --> 00:29:52,640
we want to keep the microbes happy

716
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:54,140
to produce great tasting alcohol.

717
00:29:54,140 --> 00:29:55,807
That's why we play music here.

718
00:29:55,807 --> 00:29:58,140
They play music to help microbes grow well.

719
00:29:58,140 --> 00:30:00,240
They even care about the microbes' feelings.

720
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:02,274
- Exactly. / - This looks amazing.

721
00:30:02,574 --> 00:30:06,374
Rice wine should be made in an analog way.

722
00:30:06,374 --> 00:30:07,540
- I see. / - You're right.

723
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:09,107
The visitors like that.

724
00:30:10,074 --> 00:30:13,240
(A beautiful garden with an analog vibe)

725
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:15,540
- There's a garden there. / - It's beautiful.

726
00:30:15,874 --> 00:30:17,474
- It is beautiful. / - It looks nice on screen...

727
00:30:17,474 --> 00:30:18,907
But if you go there in person...

728
00:30:18,907 --> 00:30:21,740
The trees there are 70 to 80 years old.

729
00:30:21,740 --> 00:30:23,807
- The trees there are very old. / - How adorable.

730
00:30:23,807 --> 00:30:25,374
What is that? They're so cute.

731
00:30:25,374 --> 00:30:26,540
(We're not alcoholics)

732
00:30:27,574 --> 00:30:30,140
Look at this tree here.

733
00:30:30,607 --> 00:30:35,040
"Grandson of Genghis Khan from the Yuan Dynasty..."

734
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:36,307
Really?

735
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:39,007
Whose grandson?

736
00:30:39,007 --> 00:30:41,607
- He's so weird. / - Genghis Khan's grandson is a tree?

737
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:46,940
"Grandson of Genghis Khan..."

738
00:30:46,940 --> 00:30:49,574
It says this is Genghis Khan's grandson.

739
00:30:49,574 --> 00:30:50,840
His grandson is a tree?

740
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:52,807
(He has never heard of it)

741
00:30:52,807 --> 00:30:55,174
No, you have to read it to the end.

742
00:30:55,174 --> 00:30:57,007
- It's Kublai Khan. / - Kublai Khan is his grandson.

743
00:30:57,007 --> 00:30:58,274
(It's still confusing)

744
00:30:58,274 --> 00:31:00,407
- Kublai Khan is his grandson. / - That's it.

745
00:31:00,407 --> 00:31:01,274
He planted the tree there.

746
00:31:01,274 --> 00:31:05,074
He planted this tree here.

747
00:31:05,074 --> 00:31:08,940
It's fascinating that a 700-year-old tree is still alive.

748
00:31:09,274 --> 00:31:11,507
- You have many flaws, Hyunchul. / - Yes.

749
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:13,907
I just learned that now too.

750
00:31:15,307 --> 00:31:18,007
(What would it taste like?)

751
00:31:18,307 --> 00:31:19,574
You have to smell it first.

752
00:31:19,574 --> 00:31:22,140
- I wish you good health. / - Thank you.

753
00:31:22,774 --> 00:31:24,940
You shouldn't give me too much.

754
00:31:24,940 --> 00:31:26,307
How good would that be?

755
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:28,907
- It was incredible. / - It looks so good.

756
00:31:29,874 --> 00:31:31,407
(They smell it first)

757
00:31:31,407 --> 00:31:32,707
There you go.

758
00:31:33,474 --> 00:31:34,974
This is proper rice wine.

759
00:31:36,774 --> 00:31:37,840
Yes.

760
00:31:39,507 --> 00:31:41,207
How is it? I'm so curious.

761
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:42,640
(Cho Janghyuck's Trivial Encyclopedia)

762
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:45,307
(Traditional Alcohol)

763
00:31:45,307 --> 00:31:48,340
The most commonly used sweetener is aspartame.

764
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:49,640
This doesn't have that.

765
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:53,107
Rice wine used to contain 6% alcohol content.

766
00:31:53,107 --> 00:31:54,974
So you had to add water to it.

767
00:31:54,974 --> 00:31:57,474
But then it becomes bland, so they added aspartame.

768
00:31:57,474 --> 00:31:59,274
But this one is not mixed with water.

769
00:31:59,274 --> 00:32:00,240
It's thick.

770
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:03,107
It tastes like 12% original rice wine.

771
00:32:03,907 --> 00:32:08,307
That rice wine doesn't expire too quick,

772
00:32:08,307 --> 00:32:09,807
even without aspartame.

773
00:32:09,807 --> 00:32:11,907
- How long does it last? / - It lasts about 20 days.

774
00:32:11,907 --> 00:32:12,974
- But... / - 20 days?

775
00:32:12,974 --> 00:32:14,307
That's only if you store it in a proper way.

776
00:32:14,307 --> 00:32:17,074
It doesn't mean anything though.

777
00:32:17,074 --> 00:32:18,274
If you just leave rice wine for a long time,

778
00:32:18,274 --> 00:32:19,507
it becomes vinegar.

779
00:32:20,174 --> 00:32:21,774
- I see. / - It ages more.

780
00:32:21,774 --> 00:32:23,240
- Like wine. / - Just like wine vinegar.

781
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:24,407
Let me have another glass.

782
00:32:24,774 --> 00:32:26,507
- You want to have it too, right? / - I do.

783
00:32:26,507 --> 00:32:28,407
It's very thick.

784
00:32:29,007 --> 00:32:30,007
(He must be dying to try it)

785
00:32:30,007 --> 00:32:33,340
- Hey. / - Just smell it.

786
00:32:33,340 --> 00:32:34,540
I'm not saying you should drink it.

787
00:32:34,540 --> 00:32:35,840
Here you are.

788
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:38,940
(They spontaneously came here, but seem to love it)

789
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:40,874
- Look at me. / - Why?

790
00:32:40,874 --> 00:32:42,607
Why can't you look at me? You want to drink?

791
00:32:44,107 --> 00:32:46,007
You can drink it soon.

792
00:32:46,007 --> 00:32:47,474
- Wait there. / - We'll drink it...

793
00:32:47,474 --> 00:32:48,874
You should wait there.

794
00:32:49,474 --> 00:32:50,640
Wait there.

795
00:32:50,740 --> 00:32:52,207
Don't waste it. Let me drink it.

796
00:32:53,340 --> 00:32:54,540
Don't drink too much.

797
00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:56,140
This is amazing.

798
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:59,807
(He's relieved that they couldn't sail today)

799
00:32:59,807 --> 00:33:02,207
Like this. See? See?

800
00:33:02,207 --> 00:33:03,640
Don't drink any more.

801
00:33:03,740 --> 00:33:05,674
We should go have breakfast.

802
00:33:05,674 --> 00:33:07,207
My hand just moved without thinking.

803
00:33:07,974 --> 00:33:09,140
It poured without me thinking.

804
00:33:09,607 --> 00:33:11,640
(This is delicious)

805
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:13,540
When I drink, I drink properly.

806
00:33:13,540 --> 00:33:15,574
- I also... / - Here you are.

807
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:17,074
- Here's your rice wine. / - Thank you!

808
00:33:17,074 --> 00:33:18,574
We bought a box of it.

809
00:33:18,574 --> 00:33:20,074
I didn't drink anything, and I'm carrying this.

810
00:33:20,074 --> 00:33:21,340
They drank 6 bottles that night.

811
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:23,707
Imagine how good it was.

812
00:33:23,707 --> 00:33:26,040
Let's not go to a restaurant for abalone.

813
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:28,107
Let's go to a fish market nearby.

814
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:30,740
Let's buy fish there and eat at our place.

815
00:33:33,407 --> 00:33:35,940
Our opponents are Seungsoo and Jeongcheol, right?

816
00:33:36,474 --> 00:33:37,640
What is famous in Tongyeong?

817
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:38,840
I know it's famous for fishing spots.

818
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:40,940
- Oysters. / - I see. It's famous for oysters.

819
00:33:40,940 --> 00:33:43,107
You can't compare oyster with abalone.

820
00:33:43,274 --> 00:33:46,674
Oysters in Tongyeong are delicious.

821
00:33:46,674 --> 00:33:50,740
In Tongyeong, there's this famous restaurant

822
00:33:50,740 --> 00:33:52,140
that has a Japanese name.

823
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:53,940
- Dachi. / - Dachi.

824
00:33:54,340 --> 00:33:56,540
- You're right. / - You can't compare.

825
00:33:56,540 --> 00:33:58,774
- You can't forget that place. / - Lots of good places.

00:34:12,774 --> 00:34:14,574
- That's Jang Bogo. / - Jang Bogo.

830

00:34:32,474 --> 00:34:35,240
There's a seafood center.

836
00:34:36,907 --> 00:34:41,040
(30 minutes from distillery to Wando abalone street)

837
00:34:41,540 --> 00:34:42,707
It's cold.

838
00:34:43,374 --> 00:34:44,807
It's cold. I see abalone.

839
00:34:45,874 --> 00:34:47,474

That's what you eat in Jeju-do.

00:35:38,207 --> 00:35:41,074
Wow, this wind...

865
00:35:41,574 --> 00:35:44,074
This doesn't feel like the wind of May.

866

We couldn't take the boat,

867
00:35:47,107 --> 00:35:48,307
so we came up with that plan on the fly.

868

- That's basically a seafood market. / - Right.

871

That's the cheapest way.

872
00:35:57,574 --> 00:36:02,207
- Does this mean 6 of them are 1kg? / - Yes.

873
00:36:02,207 --> 00:36:03,440
The abalone is so big.

874
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:06,007
Exactly. The bigger it is, the more expensive.

875
00:36:06,007 --> 00:36:07,540
The big ones taste different to the smaller ones.

876

00:36:16,474 --> 00:36:18,374
I'm usually good at haggling.

881
00:36:18,374 --> 00:36:23,007
If they sell 4 or 5 abalones at $30,

882
00:36:23,007 --> 00:36:24,274
it's considered to be expensive.

883
00:36:24,274 --> 00:36:25,640
- The abalones are very big. / - They're big.

884
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:26,974
The bigger ones are more expensive.

885
00:36:26,974 --> 00:36:28,074
8 abalones is a little under 1kg.

886
00:36:28,074 --> 00:36:29,607
9 makes it a little over 1kg.

887
00:36:29,607 --> 00:36:31,807
- I see. / - We'll take 9 then.

888
00:36:31,807 --> 00:36:32,907
- 9 for 1kg. / - We'll take 9.

889
00:36:32,907 --> 00:36:34,774
- Do you want me to slice them? / - No, no.

890
00:36:34,774 --> 00:36:36,407
- You're taking them home? / - We'll take them.

891
00:36:36,407 --> 00:36:38,874
We'll take them and...

892
00:36:38,874 --> 00:36:39,874
Okay.

893
00:36:39,874 --> 00:36:41,174
3, 4, 5, 6...

894
00:36:41,174 --> 00:36:43,274
- Do we need fish? / - We don't.

895
00:36:43,274 --> 00:36:45,640
In Wando, you should eat abalone.

896
00:36:45,974 --> 00:36:50,774
(I can't wait to try them)

897
00:36:51,207 --> 00:36:53,907
Can you cut up half of them. Just half.

898
00:36:54,674 --> 00:36:57,340
Where can we eat here? Can we eat in there?

899
00:36:57,340 --> 00:36:59,240
There are seats over there.

900
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:02,007
Hey, they sell cuttlefish here.

901
00:37:02,007 --> 00:37:04,874
- Cuttlefish. / - They sell cuttlefish.

902
00:37:04,874 --> 00:37:07,374
This is cuttlefish. It's the best.

903
00:37:07,374 --> 00:37:09,040
- It's $20 each. / - It's cuttlefish.

904
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:10,607
- Each? / - It's expensive.

905
00:37:10,607 --> 00:37:12,374
- It's luxurious seafood. / - Should we buy two?

906
00:37:12,374 --> 00:37:13,774
Let's take this home.

907
00:37:13,774 --> 00:37:15,674
- Could you cut it for us? / - Please cut it for us.

908
00:37:16,307 --> 00:37:18,840
- How much is a murex? / - It's $15.

909
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:20,474
- Each? / - No, per kilogram.

910
00:37:20,474 --> 00:37:21,807
Per kilo...

911
00:37:21,807 --> 00:37:22,640
We'll take it.

912
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:24,374
The murex is awesome.

913
00:37:24,374 --> 00:37:27,574
It's normally for 4 but I'll throw in one extra.

914
00:37:28,074 --> 00:37:29,574
They had murex there.

915
00:37:29,574 --> 00:37:31,274
Murex tastes really good!

916
00:37:31,274 --> 00:37:33,474
It's really good. I thought it was only in Jeju-do.

917
00:37:33,474 --> 00:37:35,507
- They sell it in Wando too. / - It's very crunchy.

918
00:37:36,707 --> 00:37:38,374
- Abalone. / - That's the stuff.

919
00:37:38,807 --> 00:37:41,174
- That's a cuttlefish. / - This is incomparable.

920
00:37:42,307 --> 00:37:44,040
Wow, cuttlefish...

921
00:37:45,807 --> 00:37:47,974
Sesame oil and seeds...

922
00:37:49,074 --> 00:37:50,207
- It actually looks pretty. / - With the innards.

923
00:37:50,207 --> 00:37:51,574
- With the innards. / - That's the murex.

924
00:37:51,574 --> 00:37:54,007
The color looks pretty.

925
00:37:54,007 --> 00:37:55,940
You get the abalone and the innards.

926
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:57,674
You can't have that without soju, right?

927
00:37:57,674 --> 00:38:00,074
- Right. / - Not that.

928
00:38:00,074 --> 00:38:03,107
- Abalone and murex. / - Murex.

929
00:38:03,107 --> 00:38:04,707
Hey, hey, hey.

930
00:38:05,107 --> 00:38:08,540
The innards here and those look different, don't they?

931
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:10,807
This is beige, and this is green.

932
00:38:10,807 --> 00:38:11,874
Why do you think that is?

933
00:38:13,474 --> 00:38:14,974
They're both abalone innards.

934
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:17,474
- Female and male? / - Male and female.

935
00:38:18,740 --> 00:38:20,640
- I got it right. / - You did.

936
00:38:20,774 --> 00:38:22,540
- I want this one. / - Let's taste it first.

937
00:38:22,540 --> 00:38:24,140
Start with the innards?

938
00:38:24,140 --> 00:38:26,540
How did you know you're supposed to eat that first?

939
00:38:29,807 --> 00:38:31,674
(Abalone innards are more nutritious than the flesh)

940
00:38:31,674 --> 00:38:33,974
You can eat it just like that because it's fresh.

941
00:38:33,974 --> 00:38:35,207
Not everyone can eat that.

942
00:38:35,207 --> 00:38:36,640
It's savory.

943
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:38,374
When you eat abalone, you must eat the innards.

944
00:38:38,374 --> 00:38:41,174
Abalone from Wando eat fresh seaweed.

945
00:38:41,174 --> 00:38:43,707
- It looks so fresh. / - It looks delicious.

946
00:38:43,707 --> 00:38:45,840
Some people are crazy about it.

947
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:47,474
Abalone innards are really delicious.

948
00:38:48,674 --> 00:38:49,774
It's really delicious.

949
00:38:49,774 --> 00:38:51,140
It has an amazing texture.

950
00:38:51,140 --> 00:38:52,407
You must eat it where it's produced.

951
00:38:52,407 --> 00:38:55,607
How is it different from the ones in Seoul?

952
00:38:55,607 --> 00:38:57,207
The texture is different.

953
00:38:57,207 --> 00:38:58,574
- The texture is different? / - Yes.

954
00:38:58,574 --> 00:39:02,607
While being transported, they get tired.

955
00:39:02,607 --> 00:39:05,107
- They have feelings too. / - You have to consider that.

956
00:39:05,107 --> 00:39:06,240
Coming all the way to Seoul.

957
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:09,874
You can't get these for this price at restaurants.

958
00:39:10,207 --> 00:39:12,840
She did nothing but cut the abalones.

959
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:15,307
You can eat a lot of them if you eat here.

960
00:39:15,507 --> 00:39:16,840
We only ate half of the abalones we bought.

961
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:18,540
You said you'd cut the rest of the abalones.

962
00:39:18,540 --> 00:39:19,807
We still have half left.

963
00:39:20,574 --> 00:39:23,740
(The rest of them will soon show up with butter)

964
00:39:23,740 --> 00:39:26,774
We will grill them with butter later at our accommodation.

965
00:39:26,774 --> 00:39:29,640
Janghyuck will grill them.

966
00:39:30,374 --> 00:39:31,974
Try the murex.

967
00:39:31,974 --> 00:39:33,307
- This is... / - Here you are.

968
00:39:33,307 --> 00:39:36,174
- That's very crunchy. / - It's delicious.

969
00:39:36,174 --> 00:39:37,607
It's fun to chew.

970
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:42,574
With this...

971
00:39:43,074 --> 00:39:48,007
I think 80% of seafood is about the texture.

972
00:39:48,007 --> 00:39:51,440
- That crunchiness. / - The texture is amazing.

973
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:54,140
It's so delicious. After eating the abalone,

974
00:39:54,140 --> 00:39:57,540
my mind is blown away.

975
00:39:57,540 --> 00:39:59,907
(His dad jokes are the hindrance to their victory)

976
00:39:59,907 --> 00:40:02,040
This is why my team is in trouble.

977
00:40:02,207 --> 00:40:03,374
Thank you.

978
00:40:04,174 --> 00:40:07,140
I've been hoping you wouldn't tell those jokes.

979
00:40:07,140 --> 00:40:09,140
This might sound childish now

980
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:11,174
but you'll remember it and laugh before you sleep.

981
00:40:12,407 --> 00:40:14,040
I will never laugh.

982
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:18,040
Let's hurry and take these back to our accommodation.

983
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:21,240
We should eat them properly

984
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:24,374
with the traditional alcohol we got earlier.

985
00:40:24,374 --> 00:40:27,474
- Alright. / - Let me take one last piece.

986
00:40:29,807 --> 00:40:30,874
Let's go.

987
00:40:31,774 --> 00:40:33,574
It's like watching our dads.

988
00:40:34,340 --> 00:40:37,540
It was a torture to eat it without alcohol.

989
00:40:37,540 --> 00:40:39,307
You guys have a lot of stamina.

990
00:40:39,307 --> 00:40:41,274
- We do. / - We had to travel a lot.

991
00:40:41,274 --> 00:40:43,207
You should be exhausted by now.

992
00:40:43,207 --> 00:40:44,540
He even drove the car himself.

993
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:49,007
- We're not old men. / - That's our accommodation.

994
00:40:49,007 --> 00:40:50,640
It's a hanok-style place.

995
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:52,574
- It looks beautiful. / - This is nice.

996
00:40:52,574 --> 00:40:54,540
- It's hanok. / - Hanok.

997
00:40:54,540 --> 00:40:57,707
Look over there. Look at the sunset.

998
00:40:57,707 --> 00:40:59,807
(Hyunchul booked a hanok pension)

999
00:40:59,807 --> 00:41:01,740
I have never reserved such a place.

1000
00:41:01,740 --> 00:41:02,807
- It looks amazing. / - Beautiful.

1001
00:41:02,807 --> 00:41:04,140
It's the original hanok.

1002
00:41:04,140 --> 00:41:05,574
(It's time to finish their traditional dish tour)

1003
00:41:05,574 --> 00:41:08,574
- I can't wait. / - It's not just hanok-themed.

1004
00:41:08,574 --> 00:41:09,840
Hang on a second.

1005
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:11,540
I've never slept in a hanok house before.

1006
00:41:13,807 --> 00:41:14,840
This is a real hanok house.

1007
00:41:15,340 --> 00:41:16,940
- It was great inside. / - Look.

1008
00:41:16,940 --> 00:41:18,107
It's cheap also.

1009
00:41:18,107 --> 00:41:20,240
- It's really cheap. / - It's about $50 per night.

1010
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:22,974
It was a special offer.

1011
00:41:22,974 --> 00:41:24,740
I found a special offer.

1012
00:41:24,740 --> 00:41:26,240
(Inside the house is just like a traditional hanok too)

1013
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:30,574
There is a bathroom inside.

1014
00:41:30,574 --> 00:41:31,940
It's really nice there.

1015
00:41:31,940 --> 00:41:33,640
It's become cold.

1016
00:41:33,974 --> 00:41:37,540
- Gosh, it's cold. / - It felt like -5℃ that day.

1017
00:41:37,540 --> 00:41:39,040
- It was very cold. / - It was really cold.

1018
00:41:39,940 --> 00:41:43,107
- Let's get changed. / - Put on long pants.

1019
00:41:43,574 --> 00:41:46,540
(Middle-aged men afraid of the cold)

1020
00:41:46,540 --> 00:41:48,140
You should wear another layer.

1021
00:41:49,307 --> 00:41:50,507
This should be enough.

1022
00:41:52,074 --> 00:41:54,740
Should this be enough?

1023
00:41:54,874 --> 00:41:56,140
How many layers are you putting on?

1024
00:41:57,207 --> 00:41:58,907
- Here you go. / - Thank you.

1025
00:42:00,207 --> 00:42:03,307
Hey, this will be aired in June.

1026
00:42:03,507 --> 00:42:05,874
But I'm cold.

1027
00:42:06,274 --> 00:42:10,774
(You haven't seen all of the abalone yet)

1028
00:42:11,574 --> 00:42:13,974
(Abalone grilled with butter on charcoal)

1029
00:42:13,974 --> 00:42:15,707
- You grilled that yourself? / - This was amazing.

1030
00:42:15,707 --> 00:42:18,340
My wish is to eat as much abalone grilled with butter

1031
00:42:18,340 --> 00:42:19,840
as I can.

1032
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:21,040
It looks really delicious.

1033
00:42:22,574 --> 00:42:24,174
That looks fun.

1034
00:42:24,740 --> 00:42:26,340
(Shall we begin?)

1035
00:42:26,340 --> 00:42:27,740
Let's check out...

1036
00:42:27,740 --> 00:42:30,474
- Janghyuck's grilled abalone. / - Grilled abalone.

1037
00:42:31,740 --> 00:42:33,474
We need to rinse them at least once.

1038
00:42:34,274 --> 00:42:37,174
I just wash them roughly like this.

1039
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:39,507
Once they're grilled, they'll be clean.

1040
00:42:39,507 --> 00:42:41,674
You're right. The bacteria will all die from the heat.

1041
00:42:41,674 --> 00:42:44,440
- I love eating outdoors like that. / - Let's grill them.

1042
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:46,507
People who go fishing are good at this.

1043
00:42:46,507 --> 00:42:49,074
Let me slice the butter...

1044
00:42:49,974 --> 00:42:52,440
And put on top of the abalone like this.

1045
00:42:53,174 --> 00:42:56,207
Now this is grilled abalones with butter.

1046
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:57,440
They're moving.

1047
00:42:57,440 --> 00:42:58,807
You wouldn't be able to imagine

1048
00:42:58,807 --> 00:43:00,674
how incredibly delicious they were.

1049
00:43:01,174 --> 00:43:03,440
That's "bbada" not "butter."

1050
00:43:03,607 --> 00:43:05,740
What on earth?

1051
00:43:05,740 --> 00:43:07,974
- We used to call it "bbada." / - My goodness.

1052
00:43:07,974 --> 00:43:09,874
- That's right. / - So true.

1053
00:43:10,074 --> 00:43:12,307
- It's "bbada," right? / - Yes, "bbada" bibimbap.

1054
00:43:12,307 --> 00:43:13,640
That's right, "bbada" bibimbap.

1055
00:43:15,007 --> 00:43:17,340
This is hot. Do you see it?

1056
00:43:17,774 --> 00:43:20,107
It's trying to spit out the butter.

1057
00:43:20,374 --> 00:43:22,640
- Here we go. / - Pour the rice wine.

1058
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:24,074
He waited a long time.

1059
00:43:24,274 --> 00:43:26,774
- Have some. / - He can properly enjoy it.

1060
00:43:27,540 --> 00:43:30,840
This is the traditional alcohol from Haenam.

1061
00:43:31,240 --> 00:43:33,007
- We came all the way to Wando. / - All the way here.

1062
00:43:33,007 --> 00:43:34,040
Good job.

1063
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:40,007
(They gulp down the alcohol)

1064
00:43:43,140 --> 00:43:45,240
(Now he can quench his thirst)

1065
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:47,674
- Just drink up. / - Two bowls in a row.

1066
00:43:47,674 --> 00:43:49,840
(One is not enough)

1067
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:52,607
(Shaking)

1068
00:43:53,407 --> 00:43:54,207
He just cleared a bottle.

1069
00:43:54,207 --> 00:43:55,407
He does everything in three's.

1070
00:43:55,407 --> 00:43:59,074
- 3 spoons of rice. / - 3 bowls of rice wine.

1071
00:44:00,174 --> 00:44:02,474
(Now this is satisfying)

1072
00:44:03,074 --> 00:44:04,640
Let me try the cuttlefish.

1073
00:44:09,007 --> 00:44:10,140
This is amazing.

1074
00:44:11,207 --> 00:44:12,207
Amazing.

1075
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:14,740
(Let me take a piece too)

1076
00:44:15,507 --> 00:44:16,607
It's really delicious.

1077
00:44:16,607 --> 00:44:18,407
This is different from what I had in Seoul.

1078
00:44:19,607 --> 00:44:21,374
(Crunchy)

1079
00:44:21,374 --> 00:44:23,907
I don't know if you can hear this but the texture.

1080
00:44:24,540 --> 00:44:26,874
It's just awesome.

1081
00:44:28,507 --> 00:44:29,507
And...

1082
00:44:30,674 --> 00:44:33,207
The texture of the bone of the cuttlefish...

1083
00:44:34,674 --> 00:44:37,707
It's like eating cartilage.

1084
00:44:37,707 --> 00:44:39,340
No, the cuttlebone is removed.

1085
00:44:39,340 --> 00:44:41,140
I mean the rest of it.

1086
00:44:41,140 --> 00:44:43,207
- There's nothing left. / - Really?

1087
00:44:43,207 --> 00:44:44,507
They don't match.

1088
00:44:44,507 --> 00:44:46,840
- He says it's not there. / - It shouldn't be there.

1089
00:44:47,407 --> 00:44:51,340
Do you know the triangular part of the cuttlefish?

1090
00:44:51,340 --> 00:44:54,807
- That's this crunchy part. / - Really? I see.

1091
00:44:55,740 --> 00:45:00,707
(It doesn't matter which part as long as it's delicious)

1092
00:45:01,374 --> 00:45:03,740
Come here. Take a piece each.

1093
00:45:03,740 --> 00:45:04,574
Try a piece.

1094
00:45:04,574 --> 00:45:06,374
- He's so nice. / - He is.

1095
00:45:06,374 --> 00:45:09,307
Old people care a lot about the staff.

1096
00:45:09,307 --> 00:45:11,340
(Janghyuck takes care of the hungry staff)

1097
00:45:11,340 --> 00:45:12,540
You have the sauce on your mouth.

1098
00:45:13,307 --> 00:45:14,440
Open your mouth wide.

1099
00:45:16,940 --> 00:45:18,774
Over there.

1100
00:45:18,774 --> 00:45:20,407
I should cover the abalones.

1101
00:45:20,407 --> 00:45:21,407
That way, it'll cook faster.

1102
00:45:21,407 --> 00:45:24,974
We're eating the seafood that has been consumed

1103
00:45:24,974 --> 00:45:26,707
since long time ago.

1104
00:45:27,007 --> 00:45:28,807
- So... / - Wait a minute.

1105
00:45:28,807 --> 00:45:30,074
Hold on. I'm sorry.

1106
00:45:30,574 --> 00:45:32,007
That's more important to me.

1107
00:45:32,007 --> 00:45:33,874
It's doesn't feel like we're drinking.

1108
00:45:33,874 --> 00:45:36,007
We need to get an insert shot.

1109
00:45:37,740 --> 00:45:40,707
It looks like you're interrupting on purpose.

1110
00:45:41,707 --> 00:45:45,474
It's abalone with butter.

1111
00:45:46,040 --> 00:45:47,274
- Goodness. / - That looks delicious.

1112
00:45:47,274 --> 00:45:50,140
- Is it available in Seoul? / - That's amazing.

1113
00:45:50,140 --> 00:45:51,774
Because the abalone is fresh,

1114
00:45:51,774 --> 00:45:54,207
it absorbs butter really well.

1115
00:45:55,374 --> 00:45:56,807
Smell it.

1116
00:45:59,340 --> 00:46:02,174
- Don't cut it too small. / - I'll cut it this big.

1117
00:46:02,174 --> 00:46:03,474
That's good.

1118
00:46:04,040 --> 00:46:05,707
It's amazing.

1119
00:46:05,707 --> 00:46:08,740
With this, we'll eat the innards later.

1120
00:46:10,007 --> 00:46:11,240
Okay.

1121
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:13,207
Since you've been through a lot today.

1122
00:46:13,207 --> 00:46:15,174
- I'll try it. / - Here you go.

1123
00:46:15,174 --> 00:46:18,407
You can have it. But we need salt, so I'll open this.

1124
00:46:18,407 --> 00:46:25,340
(After having a sip, he takes a piece of abalone)

1125
00:46:26,274 --> 00:46:27,607
- We don't need salt. / - We don't?

1126
00:46:27,607 --> 00:46:29,440
- No? Is it seasoned naturally? / - Yes.

1127
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:31,140
- Okay. / - Was it really good?

1128
00:46:31,140 --> 00:46:33,807
- You don't need to dip it in salt. / - It's good.

1129
00:46:34,507 --> 00:46:37,140
You grilled it in butter. There's no need for salt.

1130
00:46:37,274 --> 00:46:39,174
It doesn't need seasoning.

1131
00:46:39,174 --> 00:46:40,840
Can you taste the butter?

1132
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:42,707
- Yes, totally. / - Right?

1133
00:46:48,007 --> 00:46:50,207
Oyster can't beat that.

1134
00:46:50,207 --> 00:46:51,974
(He's confident about the abalone)

1135
00:46:51,974 --> 00:46:53,840
When you normally go to a pension,

1136
00:46:53,840 --> 00:46:55,840
you grill meat.

1137
00:46:55,840 --> 00:46:57,940
But it's quite refreshing to see seafood.

1138
00:46:57,940 --> 00:46:59,907
That pension wasn't that expensive.

1139
00:46:59,907 --> 00:47:02,840
(It's not a fancy meal, but it's very delicious)

1140
00:47:03,107 --> 00:47:06,840
We came here wondering why we came together.

1141
00:47:06,840 --> 00:47:09,840
I think I've got about 50% of the answer.

1142
00:47:09,840 --> 00:47:10,874
I agree.

1143
00:47:10,874 --> 00:47:13,440
Anyway, for tomorrow,

1144
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:17,074
we'll do a tour geared toward having health food.

1145
00:47:17,074 --> 00:47:19,307
- We'll have to start early. / - It'll be fun.

1146
00:47:19,307 --> 00:47:20,607
- Yes. / - Cheers.

1147
00:47:20,607 --> 00:47:21,874
- Cheers. / - For our trip.

1148
00:47:21,874 --> 00:47:23,174
Let's have a good trip.

1149
00:47:31,707 --> 00:47:33,374
People will think we're heavy drinkers.

1150
00:47:33,840 --> 00:47:35,174
We practically are.

1151
00:47:35,174 --> 00:47:36,707
The atmosphere is nice.

1152
00:47:36,707 --> 00:47:38,640
- Isn't it? / - It's perfect for rice wine.

1153
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:42,107
(The darkness fades, and the sun starts to shine)

1154
00:47:42,107 --> 00:47:46,074
(The trees shine brightly in the morning sun)

1155
00:47:46,074 --> 00:47:50,507
(It has such a beautiful, quaint atmosphere)

1156
00:47:51,574 --> 00:47:53,707
- That hanok pension is great. / - Isn't it so pretty?

1157
00:47:53,707 --> 00:47:54,540
Yes.

1158
00:47:56,940 --> 00:47:59,474
- Let's go. / - Let's go.

1159
00:47:59,474 --> 00:48:00,674
Let's get going.

1160
00:48:01,007 --> 00:48:02,940
Hanok is really nice.

1161
00:48:02,940 --> 00:48:05,540
- This was my first time. / - This was your first time?

1162
00:48:05,540 --> 00:48:08,240
Yes, it feels nice. I feel really refreshed.

1163
00:48:08,840 --> 00:48:11,007
- Let's get in and go. / - Alright.

1164
00:48:11,540 --> 00:48:13,074
Here we go.

1165
00:48:14,440 --> 00:48:16,440
The weather was fantastic.

1166
00:48:17,307 --> 00:48:20,507
It's really nice to take your kids to a hanok pension

1167
00:48:20,507 --> 00:48:21,107
with grass yard.

1168
00:48:21,107 --> 00:48:22,040
Of course.

1169
00:48:22,707 --> 00:48:24,174
Today, we're having a health food tour.

1170
00:48:24,174 --> 00:48:26,307
Lee Useok's recommendations.

1171
00:48:26,307 --> 00:48:30,274
Grilled fish, abalone bread, pike eel stew.

1172
00:48:30,274 --> 00:48:33,507
Ripped and cut. The ripped and cut tour.

1173
00:48:33,507 --> 00:48:36,274
What do you think? Look at this muscle.

1174
00:48:36,274 --> 00:48:38,540
It'll get bigger after I eat health food.

1175
00:48:38,540 --> 00:48:40,440
What muscle? You don't have any.

1176
00:48:41,640 --> 00:48:43,074
Please add some with CG.

1177
00:48:43,507 --> 00:48:45,674
There's scorpion fish.

1178
00:48:45,674 --> 00:48:48,274
- Scorpion fish? / - I know.

1179
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:50,707
First of all, it tastes amazing.

1180
00:48:50,874 --> 00:48:52,274
Spicy fish soup is good

1181
00:48:52,274 --> 00:48:53,574
but there's a grilled fish restaurant.

1182
00:48:53,774 --> 00:48:56,174
- You eat it grilled? / - Yes.

1183
00:48:56,174 --> 00:48:57,707
They even debone it for you.

1184
00:48:58,807 --> 00:49:02,940
(You can enjoy delicious fresh fish)

1185
00:49:04,307 --> 00:49:07,340
(With their hands)

1186
00:49:07,340 --> 00:49:11,540
(They debone it for you)

1187
00:49:12,407 --> 00:49:13,807
(They arrive at the fish restaurant)

1188
00:49:13,807 --> 00:49:19,540
This restaurant reminds me of a beer bar or a cafe...

1189
00:49:19,540 --> 00:49:21,907
- In the 1970s. / - It does look like a cafe.

1190
00:49:21,907 --> 00:49:23,074
- Doesn't it? / - Yes.

1191
00:49:23,074 --> 00:49:25,407
It looks like an old Western restaurant.

1192
00:49:25,407 --> 00:49:27,107
- I think it used to be. / - Yes.

1193
00:49:27,507 --> 00:49:31,374
- We'll have the grilled fish. / - Grilled fish meal.

1194
00:49:31,374 --> 00:49:32,774
It's $15.

1195
00:49:32,774 --> 00:49:34,374
I guess it's a proper meal.

1196
00:49:35,407 --> 00:49:37,540
Pour me a drink.

1197
00:49:37,774 --> 00:49:40,240
(Here, take some fresh water)

1198
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:41,907
Tap for you.

1199
00:49:41,907 --> 00:49:44,774
It's water. We don't drink every day.

1200
00:49:44,774 --> 00:49:46,940
I know it's water, but let's have a toast.

1201
00:49:46,940 --> 00:49:48,607
We don't need to toast.

1202
00:49:48,607 --> 00:49:50,607
We drank all night last night.

1203
00:49:50,607 --> 00:49:52,607
What do you mean all night? We drank briefly.

1204
00:49:53,507 --> 00:49:55,974
(They drink water instead of alcohol in the morning)

1205
00:49:56,107 --> 00:49:58,140
(Finally, the meal arrives)

1206
00:49:58,140 --> 00:49:59,240
Thank you.

1207
00:50:00,674 --> 00:50:02,940
- Here they are, the side dishes. / - Nice.

1208
00:50:02,940 --> 00:50:04,974
- There are so many. / - I love that about Jeolla-do.

1209
00:50:04,974 --> 00:50:06,807
That's great. They bring out so much.

1210
00:50:06,807 --> 00:50:08,840
And they're all delicious.

1211
00:50:08,840 --> 00:50:10,807
- What is that? / - What's that?

1212
00:50:11,074 --> 00:50:12,840
Usually, they give spinach bean paste stew

1213
00:50:12,840 --> 00:50:15,440
or curled mallow bean paste stew.

1214
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:17,507
- You can smell the ocean. / - You definitely can.

1215
00:50:17,974 --> 00:50:20,007
- It's unusual. / - I've never had that bean paste stew.

1216
00:50:21,074 --> 00:50:23,140
(The flavor suits the middle-aged men)

1217
00:50:23,140 --> 00:50:24,340
This is fantastic.

1218
00:50:25,840 --> 00:50:27,707
- They're curing their hangovers. / - They are.

1219
00:50:27,707 --> 00:50:29,307
(It looks like they're eating to cure their hangover)

1220
00:50:29,874 --> 00:50:31,974
(Here comes the real taste of the sea)

1221
00:50:31,974 --> 00:50:33,674
Can we eat all this?

1222
00:50:33,707 --> 00:50:35,774
(The grilled fish from the South Sea)

1223
00:50:35,774 --> 00:50:37,140
- Red sea bream. / - Spanish mackerel.

There is a fruit that only grows in the southern area.

1395
00:57:33,474 --> 00:57:34,907
- Fruit? / - Yes.

1396
00:57:34,907 --> 00:57:36,807
- Let's try this. / - You drink from that side.

1397
00:57:39,107 --> 00:57:42,007
It grows in Wando because it's warm.

1398
00:57:42,007 --> 00:57:43,274
(What does the loquat lemon tea taste like?)

1399
00:57:44,807 --> 00:57:45,974
- Is it good? / - Try it.

1400
00:57:46,140 --> 00:57:47,340
I've never tasted something like this before.

1401
00:57:47,574 --> 00:57:51,874
(Hyunchul also takes a sip of loquat lemon tea)

1402
00:57:53,807 --> 00:57:56,940
I've never experienced this fragrance before.

1403
00:57:56,940 --> 00:57:58,340
- It's good. / - It's unique.

1404
00:57:58,340 --> 00:58:02,207
The leaves of loquats really look like the instrument.

1405
00:58:02,207 --> 00:58:04,940
- Really? / - That's how it got its name.

1406
00:58:04,940 --> 00:58:08,740
These days, people not only eat health food

1407
00:58:08,740 --> 00:58:10,607
to be invigorated but they also take in fresh air.

1408
00:58:10,640 --> 00:58:12,340
When you go to arboretums,

1409
00:58:12,340 --> 00:58:14,974
it's full of phytoncide.

1410
00:58:15,207 --> 00:58:18,674
People say that phytoncide cures cancer.

1411
00:58:18,674 --> 00:58:19,840
Do you like to walk?

1412
00:58:19,840 --> 00:58:21,207
Of course.

1413
00:58:21,207 --> 00:58:23,040
I'm full. Let's walk.

1414
00:58:23,040 --> 00:58:25,474
I heard that there was an arboretum near here.

1415
00:58:25,474 --> 00:58:26,740
Okay, let's go.

1416
00:58:26,740 --> 00:58:27,807
An arboretum?

1417
00:58:27,807 --> 00:58:30,874
They have an amazing a broadleaf forest there.

1418
00:58:30,874 --> 00:58:32,007
It's really amazing.

1419
00:58:32,007 --> 00:58:33,474
I heard that there was an arboretum near here.

1420
00:58:33,474 --> 00:58:35,274
- Wow. / - Just like that.

1421
00:58:35,274 --> 00:58:36,574
It's really amazing.

1422
00:58:36,574 --> 00:58:38,840
(Fresh water and fresh air)

1423
00:58:38,840 --> 00:58:42,474
(The largest temperate forest habitat in the world)

1424
00:58:42,940 --> 00:58:44,374
(Wando Arboretum)

1425
00:58:44,374 --> 00:58:45,974
(Built in 1991, the size of 2,800 soccer stadiums)

1426
00:58:45,974 --> 00:58:48,340
(The largest temperate forest habitat in the world)

1427
00:58:48,707 --> 00:58:49,907
(25 minutes to the arboretum)

1428
00:58:49,907 --> 00:58:52,074
The arboretum must be deep in the mountains.

1429
00:58:52,074 --> 00:58:53,107
Wow.

1430
00:58:54,340 --> 00:58:56,507
(They arrive at the arboretum)

1431
00:58:56,607 --> 00:58:59,174
The weather is amazing today.

1432
00:59:00,440 --> 00:59:02,474
We had a lot of fine dust...

1433
00:59:02,474 --> 00:59:04,307
- Let's take in some phytoncide. / - Yes, yes.

1434
00:59:04,607 --> 00:59:06,540
Where are we headed to?

1435
00:59:06,540 --> 00:59:09,240
- We're here right now. / - Yes.

1436
00:59:09,240 --> 00:59:13,007
We have to go up to the forest museum.

1437
00:59:13,007 --> 00:59:14,874
I think there's a waterside deck

1438
00:59:14,874 --> 00:59:16,640
that's decorated beautifully.

1439
00:59:16,640 --> 00:59:19,107
- Let's take a walk around here. / - Let's go.

1440
00:59:19,107 --> 00:59:21,140
- Let's just take a light walk. / - Okay.

1441
00:59:22,840 --> 00:59:26,074
I found out that this place exists in Wando today.

1442
00:59:26,074 --> 00:59:29,840
Same here. Who would have thought the largest

1443
00:59:29,840 --> 00:59:31,774
broadleaf tree arboretum would be in Wando?

1444
00:59:31,774 --> 00:59:34,240
Right? We only knew because we came.

1445
00:59:34,674 --> 00:59:36,974
You know a little about trees, don't you?

1446
00:59:36,974 --> 00:59:39,040
I don't know a lot, but I have a lot of interest.

1447
00:59:39,140 --> 00:59:40,140
(Cho Janghyuck's Trivial Encyclopedia)

1448
00:59:40,140 --> 00:59:41,274
Do you also know about trees?

1449
00:59:41,274 --> 00:59:42,707
There's also a tree edition.

1450
00:59:42,707 --> 00:59:43,740
It's just trivial knowledge.

1451
00:59:43,740 --> 00:59:45,007
I saw that there was

1452
00:59:45,007 --> 00:59:48,140
a red-wood evergreen oak that I've never heard of.

1453
00:59:48,140 --> 00:59:50,674
It's called red-wood because it's red.

1454
00:59:50,674 --> 00:59:51,974
This is the red-wood evergreen oak.

1455
00:59:52,807 --> 00:59:57,674
It emits a lot more phytoncide than normal trees.

1456
00:59:58,474 --> 00:59:59,807
It emits a lot more.

1457
00:59:59,940 --> 01:00:01,474
The air is really clean there.

1458
01:00:01,474 --> 01:00:02,940
Doesn't it feel so refreshing?

1459
01:00:04,240 --> 01:00:06,307
- I think the air smells sweet. / - You're right.

1460
01:00:07,674 --> 01:00:09,840
Let's go down here.

1461
01:00:10,240 --> 01:00:11,940
Look here.

1462
01:00:12,174 --> 01:00:13,674
Look at the water.

1463
01:00:14,774 --> 01:00:18,540
(A cool stream of water is flowing)

1464
01:00:18,540 --> 01:00:20,274
(And a waterfall in the middle of the arboretum)

1465
01:00:20,274 --> 01:00:22,240
This is so nice. Lots to see.

1466
01:00:22,240 --> 01:00:23,974
- It was really nice. / - Yes.

1467
01:00:24,640 --> 01:00:27,174
- Places like this are amazing. / - This place is so nice.

1468
01:00:27,174 --> 01:00:29,674
- You should jump in. / - Can you swim there?

1469
01:00:29,674 --> 01:00:32,974
- No. / - Did you know Wando had that?

1470
01:00:32,974 --> 01:00:34,874
It's really pretty.

1471
01:00:35,940 --> 01:00:40,107
It's the largest broadleaf forest in the world.

1472
01:00:40,107 --> 01:00:41,307
I want to go in there.

1473
01:00:41,307 --> 01:00:43,240
(It looks refreshing)

1474
01:00:43,240 --> 01:00:45,674
You can put your cameras in the water.

1475
01:00:45,674 --> 01:00:46,840
Can I put it in?

1476
01:00:47,640 --> 01:00:49,007
They said that we can put our cameras in the water.

1477
01:00:49,007 --> 01:00:50,074
Really?

1478
01:00:50,374 --> 01:00:53,074
(If you say so)

1479
01:00:53,074 --> 01:00:55,107
Hey, come here.

1480
01:00:55,707 --> 01:00:56,907
Can you see this?

1481
01:00:56,940 --> 01:00:58,174
They're marsh snails.

1482
01:01:01,040 --> 01:01:02,807
Those are marsh snails.

1483
01:01:02,940 --> 01:01:04,007
If you go to Chungcheong-do...

1484
01:01:04,007 --> 01:01:05,240
You need clean water.

1485
01:01:05,240 --> 01:01:07,574
- You have marsh snail soup. / - They live in clean water.

1486
01:01:07,840 --> 01:01:11,174
They have tables and benches all around.

1487
01:01:11,174 --> 01:01:13,574
(Where will they go next after seeing the waterfall?)

1488
01:01:14,174 --> 01:01:16,307
Wow. What is this?

1489
01:01:19,307 --> 01:01:23,007
(They go to the waterside deck)

1490
01:01:23,774 --> 01:01:25,107
That looks like a palace.

1491
01:01:25,107 --> 01:01:27,374
(They're captivated by the charm of the arboretum)

1492
01:01:27,774 --> 01:01:30,240
Look at this place.

1493
01:01:30,240 --> 01:01:32,107
Look at the walls all lined up here.

1494
01:01:32,107 --> 01:01:33,607
What song comes to mind here?

1495
01:01:33,607 --> 01:01:34,840
"What a Wonderful World."

1496
01:01:35,207 --> 01:01:38,707
- ♪ I see trees of green ♪ / - Not that.

1497
01:01:38,707 --> 01:01:39,874
A Korean song.

1498
01:01:40,407 --> 01:01:42,940
How about... ♪ In the afternoon sun ♪

1499
01:01:44,674 --> 01:01:46,374
It's a sad song though.

1500
01:01:46,374 --> 01:01:47,974
I forgot that they were singers.

1501
01:01:47,974 --> 01:01:49,074
That's right.

1502
01:01:49,074 --> 01:01:51,074
- Doesn't seem like it, huh? / - They're not food fighters.

1503
01:01:51,740 --> 01:01:53,107
- I love it here. / - Yes.

1504
01:01:54,740 --> 01:01:59,674
(An afternoon with the sun shining warmly)

1505
01:01:59,674 --> 01:02:03,140
(Waterside deck)

1506
01:02:04,140 --> 01:02:06,240
This is inner healing.

1507
01:02:06,240 --> 01:02:08,774
I don't need anything else. This is inner healing.

1508
01:02:08,974 --> 01:02:11,907
So this is what it means to walk a forest path.

1509
01:02:12,240 --> 01:02:13,940
I love it so much.

1510
01:02:14,440 --> 01:02:16,040
I really like water.

1511
01:02:18,040 --> 01:02:19,174
The air is so nice.

1512
01:02:19,707 --> 01:02:22,140
The water is so clear. Look at this.

1513
01:02:22,207 --> 01:02:23,574
- It's water from the stream. / - Yes.

1514
01:02:23,574 --> 01:02:28,907
(A forest path full of phytoncide)

1515
01:02:28,907 --> 01:02:32,940
(Provides inner healing for all)

1516
01:02:32,940 --> 01:02:35,607
Look over there. It's amazing.

1517
01:02:44,974 --> 01:02:47,407
It's pretty everywhere.

1518
01:02:47,807 --> 01:02:49,507
It's so nice here.

1519
01:02:49,507 --> 01:02:51,474
The waterside was so beautiful.

1520
01:02:53,074 --> 01:02:54,674
They made it perfect for walks.

1521
01:02:54,674 --> 01:02:56,574
- Yes. / - Around the lake.

1522
01:02:57,140 --> 01:02:58,774
After you stuff yourself,

1523
01:02:58,774 --> 01:03:01,174
you have to walk there.

1524
01:03:01,174 --> 01:03:02,674
When you walk such a beautiful path,

1525
01:03:02,674 --> 01:03:04,174
don't you say all sorts of things unintentionally?

1526
01:03:04,174 --> 01:03:05,840
That's right. We talked a lot.

1527
01:03:06,007 --> 01:03:08,540
We can end up having meaningful talks.

1528
01:03:08,540 --> 01:03:10,007
It looks really peaceful.

1529
01:03:11,540 --> 01:03:12,974
It's a pity that we can't fish.

1530
01:03:12,974 --> 01:03:14,040
There's always next time.

1531
01:03:14,040 --> 01:03:15,340
It's a pity that we can't ride bicycles.

1532
01:03:15,340 --> 01:03:16,540
Gosh.

1533
01:03:16,540 --> 01:03:22,340
(Enjoying the fresh air at Wando Arboretum)

1534
01:03:26,574 --> 01:03:28,874
(Health food tour)

1535
01:03:28,874 --> 01:03:30,607
(Pike eel stew)

1536
01:03:30,607 --> 01:03:32,474
If you've gone there,

1537
01:03:32,474 --> 01:03:34,507
you need to eat health food.

1538
01:03:34,507 --> 01:03:35,974
Do you know pike eels?

1539
01:03:35,974 --> 01:03:37,740
- I know pike eels. / - Of course.

1540
01:03:37,740 --> 01:03:39,474
I really love pike eels.

1541
01:03:39,474 --> 01:03:41,507
- Pike eels. / - There's a pike eel stew.

1542
01:03:44,140 --> 01:03:47,274
(Forget about the eels you know!)

1543
01:03:51,440 --> 01:03:52,807
It looks so nice.

1544
01:03:53,074 --> 01:03:55,274
That was amazing.

1545
01:03:55,374 --> 01:03:56,574
That's true health food.

1546
01:03:58,074 --> 01:04:00,507
It's pike eel stew.

1547
01:04:02,374 --> 01:04:03,674
Oh, my.

1548
01:04:04,440 --> 01:04:05,674
It's pike eel stew.

1549
01:04:06,174 --> 01:04:07,574
I've had that.

1550
01:04:07,640 --> 01:04:08,740
Where did you have it?

1551
01:04:08,740 --> 01:04:10,040
In Haenam.

1552
01:04:13,074 --> 01:04:18,907
(15 minutes from the arboretum to pike eel restaurant)

1553
01:04:20,007 --> 01:04:22,740
(They arrive at the pike eel restaurant)

1554
01:04:22,740 --> 01:04:24,274
It suddenly smells like the sea.

1555
01:04:24,274 --> 01:04:27,007
- Does it? / - That's why this restaurant...

1556
01:04:27,007 --> 01:04:31,940
Catches eels here and cooks it right away.

1557
01:04:31,940 --> 01:04:34,140
The eels live nearby.

1558
01:04:34,140 --> 01:04:35,774
They live in the mudflats.

1559
01:04:35,774 --> 01:04:37,474
You know eel tastes better from the mudflats, right?

1560
01:04:37,474 --> 01:04:39,374
The owner opens the restaurant

1561
01:04:39,374 --> 01:04:42,274
if they catch eels that day.

1562
01:04:42,274 --> 01:04:44,740
- If they don't, they close. / - They don't?

1563
01:04:44,740 --> 01:04:47,840
When they catch fish, they cook that and sell it.

1564
01:04:47,840 --> 01:04:53,707
So places like that can't be found on the internet.

1565
01:04:53,707 --> 01:04:55,507
You have to be lucky.

1566
01:04:55,507 --> 01:04:57,540
- Of course. / - It's a cat.

1567
01:05:00,640 --> 01:05:03,274
(Looking around)

1568
01:05:03,274 --> 01:05:05,007
So here it's...

1569
01:05:05,007 --> 01:05:06,307
The highlight.

1570
01:05:06,307 --> 01:05:08,440
It's the highlight of the health food tour.

1571
01:05:08,440 --> 01:05:10,874
Drink by yourself.

1572
01:05:10,874 --> 01:05:13,607
I drove so...

1573
01:05:14,574 --> 01:05:16,574
(Heh)

1574
01:05:16,574 --> 01:05:18,607
This is important.

1575
01:05:19,707 --> 01:05:20,740
(Gulping)

1576
01:05:20,740 --> 01:05:22,607
- It doesn't seem like a restaurant. / - Right.

1577
01:05:22,607 --> 01:05:25,240
- Why are you whispering? / - In case they hear.

1578
01:05:25,240 --> 01:05:30,074
But the best restaurants look shabby like this.

1579
01:05:30,074 --> 01:05:31,540
This is the true eatery.

1580
01:05:33,174 --> 01:05:36,940
Other places work on the design and interior.

1581
01:05:36,940 --> 01:05:38,174
But this place doesn't need any of that.

1582
01:05:38,174 --> 01:05:39,974
They know their food tastes good enough.

1583
01:05:39,974 --> 01:05:41,274
(We're confident in our food)

1584
01:05:41,440 --> 01:05:44,007
It's similar to me. I don't need good looks.

1585
01:05:44,007 --> 01:05:45,640
- I rely only on my singing. / - You're handsome.

1586
01:05:45,640 --> 01:05:47,174
- Stop that. / - You're handsome.

1587
01:05:47,174 --> 01:05:48,807
- What's wrong with you? / - You're handsome.

1588
01:05:49,540 --> 01:05:51,540
That's how you respond.

1589
01:05:51,540 --> 01:05:52,607
You're handsome.

1590
01:05:52,840 --> 01:05:56,040
What's the most popular dish here?

1591
01:05:56,040 --> 01:05:59,474
The pike eel stew.

1592
01:06:03,207 --> 01:06:04,140
Thank you.

1593
01:06:04,574 --> 01:06:06,574
- Yes. / - Gosh.

1594
01:06:06,607 --> 01:06:08,507
(This is what health food looks like)

1595
01:06:08,507 --> 01:06:10,540
They cooked the whole eel.

1596
01:06:10,540 --> 01:06:13,607
That's cold bean soup. That tastes good too.

1597
01:06:13,607 --> 01:06:16,807
They serve the pike peel like that as well.

1598
01:06:16,807 --> 01:06:17,974
That's the eel stew.

1599
01:06:18,807 --> 01:06:19,707
(They try the grilled pike eel first)

1600
01:06:19,707 --> 01:06:21,774
- Let's try this. / - This one...

1601
01:06:21,774 --> 01:06:23,440
Are you eating fried eel?

1602
01:06:23,440 --> 01:06:25,107
- No. / - It is grilled eel.

1603
01:06:25,107 --> 01:06:27,374
- It's dried and grilled. / - So that's dried.

1604
01:06:27,374 --> 01:06:29,240
They grill dried eel.

1605
01:06:29,540 --> 01:06:34,074
They catch pike eel without a hook.

1606
01:06:34,074 --> 01:06:37,540
You just need the bait and when you throw it in...

1607
01:06:37,540 --> 01:06:40,240
Eels are predators so they swallow it whole.

1608
01:06:40,240 --> 01:06:43,007
That's when you pull it up. That's the skill you need.

1609
01:06:43,007 --> 01:06:44,240
That's why they're called that.

1610
01:06:44,774 --> 01:06:47,207
- That looks so good. / - It's amazing.

1611
01:06:48,174 --> 01:06:52,607
(How does it taste?)

1612
01:06:52,807 --> 01:06:54,074
I'll take the tail.

1613
01:07:04,307 --> 01:07:07,274
It's good. How did they make this?

1614
01:07:07,707 --> 01:07:09,640
Did they dry it and fry it?

1615
01:07:09,640 --> 01:07:11,407
I think it's dried then fried.

1616
01:07:11,407 --> 01:07:13,007
Don't they seem grilled?

1617
01:07:13,007 --> 01:07:14,407
Ah, the texture...

1618
01:07:14,974 --> 01:07:16,540
(Janghyuck tries it again)

1619
01:07:16,540 --> 01:07:18,140
- They fried it. / - Did they fry it?

1620
01:07:18,140 --> 01:07:19,374
I know when I taste it.

1621
01:07:21,474 --> 01:07:25,874
(They cooked the dried eel in the oven)

1622
01:07:26,207 --> 01:07:29,574
- I'd love to have this with beer. / - With beer...

1623
01:07:31,474 --> 01:07:33,274
I'll have to cut the small octopus.

1624
01:07:33,340 --> 01:07:34,874
- Cut it up. / - Cut it up.

1625
01:07:36,474 --> 01:07:38,340
The stew looks so good.

1626
01:07:38,340 --> 01:07:40,174
Let's cut the head off first.

1627
01:07:41,040 --> 01:07:42,707
- Cut it up. / - Cut it up.

1628
01:07:42,707 --> 01:07:44,440
(They cut up the small octopus)

1629
01:07:44,507 --> 01:07:46,907
(When on earth can I eat?)

1630
01:07:47,907 --> 01:07:49,574
- Can't we eat the small octopus? / - You can eat it.

1631
01:07:49,574 --> 01:07:51,540
Small octopus gets tough if you cook it for too long.

1632
01:07:51,840 --> 01:07:53,240
It's really big.

1633
01:07:54,240 --> 01:07:56,040
They caught that right in front.

1634
01:07:56,074 --> 01:07:57,507
It's as big as an octopus.

1635
01:07:57,507 --> 01:07:59,074
It's really big.

1636
01:08:02,107 --> 01:08:03,607
They eat so well.

1637
01:08:04,240 --> 01:08:05,674
- Try it. / - Okay.

1638
01:08:05,674 --> 01:08:08,040
(One bite for me)

1639
01:08:08,607 --> 01:08:09,840
(Of course, the small octopus is delicious)

1640
01:08:09,840 --> 01:08:12,207
Our team doesn't speak when they eat.

1641
01:08:12,207 --> 01:08:14,074
They only enjoy it themselves.

1642
01:08:14,074 --> 01:08:16,174
They have to describe the taste.

1643
01:08:17,340 --> 01:08:18,907
I'm going to try the eel.

1644
01:08:18,907 --> 01:08:19,940
(It's time to eat the eel)

1645
01:08:20,974 --> 01:08:23,807
(Pike eel is one of the best health foods, high in protein)

1646
01:08:24,007 --> 01:08:25,007
Look at this.

1647
01:08:25,374 --> 01:08:28,974
Take this and roll it with your tongue.

1648
01:08:28,974 --> 01:08:29,474
If you do that...

1649
01:08:29,474 --> 01:08:32,574
(Slurping)

1650
01:08:34,040 --> 01:08:35,074
The bone comes out.

1651
01:08:35,907 --> 01:08:36,907
That's a new technique.

1652
01:08:36,907 --> 01:08:38,874
After Moon Seyoon...

1653
01:08:38,874 --> 01:08:40,674
(It still tastes good if you eat it normally)

1654
01:08:40,674 --> 01:08:43,574
These pike eels are also precious in Wando.

1655
01:08:43,574 --> 01:08:45,974
- The stew? / - It's not common.

1656
01:08:45,974 --> 01:08:48,174
The meat is really tender.

1657
01:08:48,174 --> 01:08:51,774
It feels like 100% cotton.

1658
01:08:51,774 --> 01:08:53,674
You must have this in fish stew.

1659
01:08:54,574 --> 01:08:56,507
The fragrance of the water parsley...

1660
01:08:57,874 --> 01:08:58,940
This is amazing.

1661
01:09:01,840 --> 01:09:03,407
(Ah)

1662
01:09:04,540 --> 01:09:05,740
Are you relieving your hangover?

1663
01:09:06,707 --> 01:09:08,840
You sound like you're relieving your hangover.

1664
01:09:11,174 --> 01:09:13,540
(It seems that he's really relieving his hangover)

1665
01:09:13,540 --> 01:09:18,007
You can tell that this is too much for two people.

1666
01:09:18,007 --> 01:09:20,207
We ordered so much to have a taste.

1667
01:09:21,340 --> 01:09:25,407
Enjoying this much eel for $50.

1668
01:09:25,407 --> 01:09:27,607
You can only do this in the place of origin.

1669
01:09:27,607 --> 01:09:28,907
It's really cost-effective.

1670
01:09:28,907 --> 01:09:29,974
Are you only going to eat this?

1671
01:09:31,174 --> 01:09:33,574
I'm thinking about it.

1672
01:09:33,574 --> 01:09:35,874
I feel like I have to drive until the end...

1673
01:09:35,874 --> 01:09:36,874
So...

1674
01:09:36,907 --> 01:09:38,807
(I got you)

1675
01:09:39,140 --> 01:09:40,774
Our managers can drive for us.

1676
01:09:40,774 --> 01:09:41,240
Let's have one last one.

1677
01:09:41,240 --> 01:09:43,574
My manager came down on the second day.

1678
01:09:43,574 --> 01:09:45,407
Let's just order one bottle.

1679
01:09:45,407 --> 01:09:50,074
(What these men need is soju)

1680
01:09:50,774 --> 01:09:51,540
(Ta-da)

1681
01:09:51,540 --> 01:09:54,374
I'm giving in on the last day.

1682
01:09:54,374 --> 01:09:56,740
What are you on about?

1683
01:09:57,374 --> 01:09:58,607
He looks happy.

1684
01:09:58,607 --> 01:10:01,174
- He's happy to see the green. / - You're right.

1685
01:10:01,774 --> 01:10:05,074
For 2 days... Good work.

1686
01:10:05,074 --> 01:10:07,074
That's kind of like a tail.

1687
01:10:07,340 --> 01:10:09,540
He wags his foot when he's happy.

1688
01:10:11,040 --> 01:10:12,940
(This is so good)

1689
01:10:12,940 --> 01:10:15,740
The food really made me want to drink.

1690
01:10:15,840 --> 01:10:19,640
(They're in a trance)

1691
01:10:19,640 --> 01:10:20,674
It tastes better, doesn't it?

1692
01:10:22,040 --> 01:10:24,707
What time does this place close?

1693
01:10:25,074 --> 01:10:26,874
What time are you planning to stay till?

1694
01:10:26,874 --> 01:10:28,640
- There he goes again. / - How many bottles do you want?

1695
01:10:28,640 --> 01:10:30,140
What time does this place close?

1696
01:10:30,140 --> 01:10:31,574
- We're open until 9 p.m. / - Okay, okay.

1697
01:10:31,574 --> 01:10:34,074
We'll just stay till 10 p.m.

1698
01:10:36,040 --> 01:10:37,840
He wants to stay there till 10.

1699
01:10:40,207 --> 01:10:42,174
- It looks really good. / - It's good.

1700
01:10:42,607 --> 01:10:45,340
They don't need words to describe that taste.

1701
01:10:45,340 --> 01:10:47,940
- I'm salivating. / - He opens his mouth really big.

1702
01:10:48,840 --> 01:10:51,374
- You can't eat this every day. / - That's right.

1703
01:10:52,240 --> 01:10:53,974
You don't get drunk if you eat like that.

1704
01:10:53,974 --> 01:10:55,507
You don't get drunk.

1705
01:10:57,107 --> 01:10:59,540
I'm not sure.

1706
01:10:59,540 --> 01:11:01,474
I think they captivated the middle-aged men only.

1707
01:11:01,474 --> 01:11:02,740
Totally.

1708
01:11:02,740 --> 01:11:04,274
I've been completely captivated,

1709
01:11:04,274 --> 01:11:05,774
since I'm a middle-aged man.

1710
01:11:05,774 --> 01:11:07,540
Me too. I want to go there.

1711
01:11:07,540 --> 01:11:10,074
The rice wine was the most memorable for me.

1712
01:11:10,074 --> 01:11:13,307
I'm surprised that it's 12%.

1713
01:11:14,440 --> 01:11:16,474
It's 12% but it doesn't taste like 12%.

1714
01:11:16,474 --> 01:11:17,074
It's not.

1715
01:11:18,040 --> 01:11:21,507
- It tastes nutty. / - Does it have a clean taste?

1716
01:11:21,507 --> 01:11:23,974
12% is still pretty sweet.

1717
01:11:23,974 --> 01:11:25,240
- It's quite sweet. / - Really?

1718
01:11:25,240 --> 01:11:27,274
Yes, it has to be sweet.

1719
01:11:27,274 --> 01:11:29,840
- But they didn't add sugar or anything. / - It's natural.

1720
01:11:29,840 --> 01:11:32,740
They just mixed yeast and used glutinous rice.

1721
01:11:32,740 --> 01:11:34,840
That's why it's sweeter.

1722
01:11:34,840 --> 01:11:36,774
We've been at this for two weeks.

1723
01:11:36,774 --> 01:11:38,474
It's mackerel vs. eel.

1724
01:11:38,474 --> 01:11:39,374
That's right.

1725
01:11:39,374 --> 01:11:41,440
And oyster vs. abalone.

1726
01:11:41,440 --> 01:11:43,240
- It feels like that. / - You're right.

1727
01:11:43,240 --> 01:11:46,140
The expenses are important now.

1728
01:11:46,140 --> 01:11:49,540
We spent $190.70 last week.

1729
01:11:49,540 --> 01:11:51,440
This week...

1730
01:11:51,440 --> 01:11:52,774
The Why Travel Together Tour.

1731
01:11:52,774 --> 01:11:54,674
How much did they spend over the 2 days?

1732
01:11:54,674 --> 01:11:59,540
The total expense of traveling Haenam and Wando is...

1733
01:11:59,540 --> 01:12:00,974
- The total is... / - Per person.

1734
01:12:00,974 --> 01:12:01,874
Per person!

1735
01:12:01,874 --> 01:12:03,774
- Excluding travel expenses. / - Excluding.

1736
01:12:03,774 --> 01:12:07,274
The total is $189.

1737
01:12:07,274 --> 01:12:09,174
I see.

1738
01:12:09,174 --> 01:12:12,007
Please say your last words.

1739
01:12:12,007 --> 01:12:17,140
Because it's located at the end of Korea,

1740
01:12:17,140 --> 01:12:20,240
we think that Haenam and Wando are very far.

1741
01:12:20,240 --> 01:12:21,607
We think it's too troublesome to go.

1742
