1
00:00:00,208 --> 00:00:04,175
I've chosen all the must-visit landmarks 

2
00:00:04,175 --> 00:00:06,575
of Bandung. 

3
00:00:06,575 --> 00:00:10,575
Men and women of all ages will enjoy this place. 

4
00:00:10,575 --> 00:00:13,508
Have a Bandung day! 

5
00:00:13,508 --> 00:00:15,108
Bye. 

6
00:00:15,775 --> 00:00:16,708
Sakhalin! 

7
00:00:16,708 --> 00:00:20,608
- We're in Sakhalin. / - Yeonwoo, this is Sakhalin. 

8
00:00:20,608 --> 00:00:23,308
I've been overwhelmed by the beauty of this place. 

9
00:00:23,308 --> 00:00:23,708
Yeah. 

10
00:00:23,708 --> 00:00:27,775
- I'm scared. / - No, no! 

11
00:00:27,775 --> 00:00:29,508
Screaming together 

12
00:00:29,508 --> 00:00:30,941
and not caring about anyone else. 

13
00:00:30,941 --> 00:00:32,775
I think that was so nice. 

14
00:00:32,775 --> 00:00:34,241
(Which team will win?) 

15
00:00:36,808 --> 00:00:39,175
(Numerous great tips on trips) 

16
00:00:41,941 --> 00:00:43,141
(Kim Sook, Sung Sikyung) 

17
00:00:44,208 --> 00:00:45,241
Travel is war. 

18
00:00:45,241 --> 00:00:48,041
Battle Trip! 

19
00:00:49,541 --> 00:00:52,841
Just like last week, our special host this week 

20
00:00:52,841 --> 00:00:54,408
is Kim Hwan. Welcome. 

21
00:00:54,408 --> 00:00:56,141
- Welcome back. / - Hello, I'm Kim Hwan. 

22
00:00:56,141 --> 00:00:57,241
So are you the regular host now? 

23
00:00:57,241 --> 00:00:59,675
- No, our team lost last week. / - Yes. 

24
00:00:59,675 --> 00:01:01,008
I was so upset about it, 

25
00:01:01,008 --> 00:01:04,041
so I came again to win the battle this week. 

26
00:01:04,041 --> 00:01:05,475
If you keep losing, 

27
00:01:05,475 --> 00:01:06,341
you might be here as a permanent. 

28
00:01:06,341 --> 00:01:08,275
- I think that's better. / - Is it? 

29
00:01:09,408 --> 00:01:11,841
- That's the plan? / - He will lose again though. 

30
00:01:11,841 --> 00:01:13,775
I know. Our trip is so good this week. 

31
00:01:13,775 --> 00:01:15,175
Today, 

32
00:01:15,175 --> 00:01:17,341
we have very special trip planners. 

33
00:01:17,341 --> 00:01:19,708
So we will introduce the trip planners first. 

34
00:01:19,708 --> 00:01:23,308
They are special because they were our special hosts. 

35
00:01:23,308 --> 00:01:24,875
- That's right. / - Just like you, Hwan. 

36
00:01:24,875 --> 00:01:25,941
- They were right here? / - Yes. 

37
00:01:25,941 --> 00:01:27,608
Then this is a big match. 

38
00:01:27,608 --> 00:01:28,808
- A big match. / - Because... 

39
00:01:28,808 --> 00:01:30,708
- They know what to do to win. / - That's right. 

40
00:01:30,708 --> 00:01:32,708
They saw everything as they hosted the show. 

41
00:01:32,708 --> 00:01:35,641
They know what to do to get more votes. 

42
00:01:35,641 --> 00:01:37,575
So this will be a big match. 

43
00:01:37,575 --> 00:01:40,008
Let's meet today's trip planners then. 

44
00:01:40,008 --> 00:01:41,941
Please come on out. 

45
00:01:42,475 --> 00:01:44,041
(Who are today's trip planners?) 

46
00:01:44,041 --> 00:01:45,608
MOMOLAND! 

47
00:01:45,608 --> 00:01:47,008
(Lee Suji, Song Daeun) 

48
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:49,741
(Jooe and Yeonwoo of MOMOLAND) 

49
00:01:50,675 --> 00:01:51,775
- We're going to win. / - We'll win. 

50
00:01:51,775 --> 00:01:52,608
- What makes you think so? / - Why? 

51
00:01:52,608 --> 00:01:54,208
Idols can't eat a lot. 

52
00:01:54,775 --> 00:01:56,508
Right, since they have to diet. 

53
00:01:56,508 --> 00:01:58,708
I heard Suji is on a diet as well. 

54
00:01:58,708 --> 00:02:00,808
- I'm not on a diet. / - Did you eat a lot? 

55
00:02:00,808 --> 00:02:03,475
I just eat three meals a day just like other people do. 

56
00:02:03,475 --> 00:02:04,708
That is also a type of diet. 

57
00:02:04,708 --> 00:02:07,475
Anyway, Suji was our special host... 

58
00:02:07,475 --> 00:02:08,741
- Back in May. / - That's right. 

59
00:02:08,741 --> 00:02:11,041
Right, it was the water festival special. 

60
00:02:11,208 --> 00:02:13,008
When were you our special host, Jooe? 

61
00:02:13,008 --> 00:02:13,975
A trip for 20-year-olds. 

62
00:02:13,975 --> 00:02:15,575
- That's right. / - A flower trip for 20-year-olds. 

63
00:02:15,575 --> 00:02:17,475
When your hair was yellow. 

64
00:02:17,475 --> 00:02:18,875
Yes, it was. 

65
00:02:18,875 --> 00:02:20,275
That's right. 

66
00:02:20,275 --> 00:02:22,241
Some of our special hosts 

67
00:02:22,241 --> 00:02:25,108
have come back as trip planners before. 

68
00:02:25,108 --> 00:02:27,741
But we've never had a battle between them like this. 

69
00:02:27,741 --> 00:02:28,275
It's the first time. 

70
00:02:28,275 --> 00:02:30,575
A big match is expected today. 

71
00:02:30,575 --> 00:02:31,875
- Suji. / - Yes? 

72
00:02:32,241 --> 00:02:33,275
Are you getting married soon? 

73
00:02:33,508 --> 00:02:35,675
- Right. / - Yes. 

74
00:02:35,675 --> 00:02:38,108
You're in trouble. 

75
00:02:38,108 --> 00:02:38,941
Why? 

76
00:02:38,941 --> 00:02:42,275
Please vote for her to congratulate her. 

77
00:02:42,441 --> 00:02:44,608
Don't say that. 

78
00:02:44,608 --> 00:02:46,675
We should bless her marriage. 

79
00:02:46,675 --> 00:02:47,941
- That's right. / - That's not the point. 

80
00:02:47,941 --> 00:02:49,708
By the way, it would've been good for Suji. 

81
00:02:49,708 --> 00:02:51,041
It might be your last trip 

82
00:02:51,041 --> 00:02:53,641
with your friend before your marriage. 

83
00:02:53,641 --> 00:02:54,908
It kind of was. 

84
00:02:54,908 --> 00:02:56,408
We had a lot of fun. 

85
00:02:56,408 --> 00:02:59,508
A trip with a friend is different from one with a lover. 

86
00:02:59,508 --> 00:03:03,075
But during the trip, I missed my boyfriend so much. 

87
00:03:03,075 --> 00:03:05,275
Then every time you had spare time, 

88
00:03:05,275 --> 00:03:06,975
you must've called your boyfriend like this. 

89
00:03:06,975 --> 00:03:08,941
Actually, my boyfriend is 3 years younger than me. 

90
00:03:08,941 --> 00:03:10,475
(Her boyfriend is younger than her?) 

91
00:03:11,041 --> 00:03:13,441
- Age doesn't matter. / - Right. 

92
00:03:13,441 --> 00:03:15,741
- Congratulations, Suji. / - Thank you. 

93
00:03:15,741 --> 00:03:17,508
Let's start the trips then. 

94
00:03:17,508 --> 00:03:20,808
I heard they went to special places for their trips. 

95
00:03:20,808 --> 00:03:22,608
Today's theme of Battle Trip is... 

96
00:03:22,908 --> 00:03:24,841
Hidden destinations 

97
00:03:24,841 --> 00:03:26,808
you must visit before everyone finds out about them. 

98
00:03:27,741 --> 00:03:30,841
It'll no longer be a hidden destination after this. 

99
00:03:30,841 --> 00:03:33,641
- Right. / - Let's find out where they went. 

100
00:03:33,641 --> 00:03:35,575
Let's check out where they went. 

101
00:03:35,575 --> 00:03:37,341
What? Sakhalin? 

102
00:03:37,341 --> 00:03:39,075
Sakhalin and Bandung? 

103
00:03:39,075 --> 00:03:41,008
- Sakhalin is very famous. / - Bandung in Indonesia? 

104
00:03:41,008 --> 00:03:42,141
- Sakhalin. / - Bandung. 

105
00:03:42,141 --> 00:03:43,208
I've never heard of Bandung before. 

106
00:03:43,208 --> 00:03:44,508
Have you heard of it? 

107
00:03:44,908 --> 00:03:45,841
Have you heard of Bandung? 

108
00:03:45,841 --> 00:03:46,941
What about Sakhalin? 

109
00:03:46,941 --> 00:03:48,241
- I've heard of Sakhalin. / - See? 

110
00:03:48,241 --> 00:03:49,308
They've heard of Sakhalin. 

111
00:03:49,308 --> 00:03:50,641
I saw it in a history book. 

112
00:03:50,641 --> 00:03:52,841
Please tell us about Bandung. It's very new to us. 

113
00:03:52,841 --> 00:03:56,441
I think there are two important things about traveling. 

114
00:03:56,708 --> 00:03:58,475
- The first one is photos. / - Yes. 

115
00:03:58,475 --> 00:04:00,475
- And the second one is food. / - I see. 

116
00:04:00,475 --> 00:04:02,975
- Food is the most important. / - Food is crucial. 

117
00:04:02,975 --> 00:04:04,475
You're right. It has to suit your tastes. 

118
00:04:04,475 --> 00:04:06,308
If it doesn't, it will ruin the whole trip. 

119
00:04:06,608 --> 00:04:08,308
And we got them both. 

120
00:04:08,308 --> 00:04:10,775
- In Bandung? / - I'm very confident about it. 

121
00:04:11,675 --> 00:04:13,608
- Let's take a look at the map. / - Where is Bandung? 

122
00:04:13,608 --> 00:04:15,341
- It's over there. / - It's near Jakarta. 

123
00:04:15,341 --> 00:04:17,608
- Jakarta? / - It's over there. 

124
00:04:18,141 --> 00:04:19,675
It's between Jakarta and Bali. 

125
00:04:19,675 --> 00:04:21,008
It's not near the coast though. 

126
00:04:21,008 --> 00:04:22,875
- Right, it's a city. / - It's an inland area. 

127
00:04:22,875 --> 00:04:26,975
Bandung is the most popular vacation place... 

128
00:04:26,975 --> 00:04:29,108
- For weekend trips for Indonesians. / - Really? 

129
00:04:29,108 --> 00:04:31,141
It's like Gapyeong in Korea. 

130
00:04:31,141 --> 00:04:32,475
- Exactly. / - Why? 

131
00:04:32,475 --> 00:04:35,175
The interesting thing is that the area is highlands. 

132
00:04:35,175 --> 00:04:37,608
So despite it being a hot country, 

133
00:04:37,608 --> 00:04:39,741
the weather is cool in Bandung. 

134
00:04:39,741 --> 00:04:41,441
I sweat a lot 

135
00:04:41,441 --> 00:04:43,841
but I didn't get hot when I was walking around. 

136
00:04:43,841 --> 00:04:45,675
Okay. What about Sakhalin? 

137
00:04:45,675 --> 00:04:47,775
We've heard of Sakhalin before. 

138
00:04:47,775 --> 00:04:50,175
That's right. We went to Sakhalin. 

139
00:04:50,175 --> 00:04:52,308
- Right. / - Wow. 

140
00:04:52,308 --> 00:04:54,408
- I just applauded with her. / - I admit... 

141
00:04:54,808 --> 00:04:56,741
Sakhalin is not new to us. 

142
00:04:56,741 --> 00:04:58,575
- Let's see where it is. / - Let's take a look at the map. 

143
00:04:59,041 --> 00:05:00,275
It's close to Korea. 

144
00:05:00,275 --> 00:05:01,841
- It's close. / - It's above Vladivostok. 

145
00:05:01,841 --> 00:05:03,541
We've been to Vladivostok. 

146
00:05:03,541 --> 00:05:06,308
It's the biggest island in Russia. 

147
00:05:06,308 --> 00:05:09,241
Around 12% of the island's population is... 

148
00:05:09,241 --> 00:05:11,275
- Korean. / - What? 

149
00:05:11,275 --> 00:05:13,541
- Is Sakhalin an island? / - Yes. 

150
00:05:13,541 --> 00:05:14,708
You didn't even know that, right? 

151
00:05:14,708 --> 00:05:16,308
- I didn't. / - See? 

152
00:05:16,308 --> 00:05:17,708
But I've heard of Sakhalin. 

153
00:05:17,708 --> 00:05:19,341
But we didn't know it was an island. 

154
00:05:19,341 --> 00:05:21,108
We have a painful history about the island. 

155
00:05:21,108 --> 00:05:22,575
- That's right. / - That's right. 

156
00:05:22,575 --> 00:05:24,808
- How was the trip, Jooe? / - Well... 

157
00:05:24,808 --> 00:05:27,175
- I've been to Vladivostok before. / - Really? 

158
00:05:27,175 --> 00:05:28,608
When I went there, 

159
00:05:28,608 --> 00:05:31,908
I didn't know what there was to see. 

160
00:05:32,141 --> 00:05:33,541
But you know what? 

161
00:05:33,975 --> 00:05:35,775
I didn't know there was Europe so close by. 

162
00:05:36,708 --> 00:05:38,808
- That's what I thought. / - European-style buildings. 

163
00:05:38,808 --> 00:05:40,375
- In Sakhalin? / - That's right. 

164
00:05:40,375 --> 00:05:41,241
To be honest... 

165
00:05:41,241 --> 00:05:43,008
- Did you like it or not? / - I loved it. 

166
00:05:43,008 --> 00:05:44,975
- Why? / - First of all... 

167
00:05:44,975 --> 00:05:46,808
When I travel abroad, 

168
00:05:46,808 --> 00:05:50,708
I'm worried about the language problem. 

169
00:05:50,708 --> 00:05:52,875
But there are a lot of people who speak Korean. 

170
00:05:52,875 --> 00:05:55,441
- There are many Koreans. / - Since 12% are Korean. 

171
00:05:56,108 --> 00:05:57,775
And there were many biracial people. 

172
00:05:57,775 --> 00:05:59,108
They even said... 

173
00:05:59,108 --> 00:06:00,841
- Hello to us in Korean. / - Really? 

174
00:06:00,841 --> 00:06:03,175
- Russian people did. / - It must've been intriguing. 

175
00:06:03,175 --> 00:06:04,308
Alright then. 

176
00:06:04,308 --> 00:06:06,575
Please enjoy the trips and cast your vote. 

177
00:06:06,575 --> 00:06:08,508
We have our 100 judges here. Nice to meet you. 

178
00:06:08,508 --> 00:06:10,075
- Welcome. / - Good to see you. 

179
00:06:10,075 --> 00:06:11,908
Hello. 

180
00:06:11,908 --> 00:06:13,741
You can vote for both trips, 

181
00:06:13,741 --> 00:06:15,508
it's not just one or the other. 

182
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:17,708
But you might as well 

183
00:06:17,708 --> 00:06:19,341
wish the future bride well. 

184
00:06:19,675 --> 00:06:21,575
Let's congratulate her. 

185
00:06:21,575 --> 00:06:23,741
- Bandung. / - Let's go to Bandung first. 

186
00:06:23,741 --> 00:06:25,275
- Can we go first? / - Sure. 

187
00:06:25,275 --> 00:06:27,041
Let's find out how to get to Bandung. 

188
00:06:27,041 --> 00:06:30,541
- From Incheon airport. / - You fly to Jakarta first. 

189
00:06:30,541 --> 00:06:33,108
- There's no direct flight. / - Go to Jakarta... 

190
00:06:33,108 --> 00:06:34,808
Once you get to Jakarta, 

191
00:06:34,808 --> 00:06:36,541
you have three options. 

192
00:06:36,541 --> 00:06:37,941
You can take another flight. 

193
00:06:37,941 --> 00:06:39,108
- You can take the train. / - It's very far. 

194
00:06:39,108 --> 00:06:42,108
- Or a bus available till late at night. / - A bus. 

195
00:06:42,108 --> 00:06:46,475
I heard you can take the best photos of your life there. 

196
00:06:46,475 --> 00:06:47,408
Why is that? 

197
00:06:47,408 --> 00:06:49,741
The entire city of Bandung is 

198
00:06:49,741 --> 00:06:52,041
like a theme park. 

199
00:06:52,041 --> 00:06:54,341
- The whole city? / - Yes. 

200
00:06:54,341 --> 00:06:56,241
When you're on a trip, 

201
00:06:56,241 --> 00:06:59,375
you can feel wary of others as you take pictures. 

202
00:06:59,775 --> 00:07:01,908
But you don't have to do that. 

203
00:07:01,908 --> 00:07:03,075
People just go there... 

204
00:07:03,075 --> 00:07:04,608
- To take good pictures. / - For the photos. 

205
00:07:04,608 --> 00:07:06,608
So did you get some awesome photos? 

206
00:07:06,941 --> 00:07:08,108
- We got plenty. / - You did? 

207
00:07:08,108 --> 00:07:09,541
I really got a lot. 

208
00:07:09,541 --> 00:07:11,575
Sook loves to take photos. 

209
00:07:11,575 --> 00:07:12,775
I do. 

210
00:07:13,008 --> 00:07:15,275
I just like shots. 

211
00:07:15,475 --> 00:07:16,708
You mean drinking shots? 

212
00:07:16,708 --> 00:07:18,575
What currency do they use in Indonesia? 

213
00:07:18,575 --> 00:07:20,975
- It's rupiah. / - Rupiah. 

214
00:07:20,975 --> 00:07:23,641
Remove two zeros from the 10,000 won. 

215
00:07:23,641 --> 00:07:24,608
Then you get 100 won. 

216
00:07:24,608 --> 00:07:26,508
Then you multiply that by 8. 

217
00:07:26,675 --> 00:07:28,575
- 800 won? / - Yes. So it's 80 cents. 

218
00:07:28,741 --> 00:07:31,408
So 10,000 rupiah is about 800 won or 80 cents. 

219
00:07:31,408 --> 00:07:33,075
It will be so fun to spend money. 

220
00:07:33,075 --> 00:07:35,341
It was. Prices are so low too. 

221
00:07:35,341 --> 00:07:36,875
- It would feel great. / - Yes. 

222
00:07:36,875 --> 00:07:38,841
How did you like the trip, Daeun? 

223
00:07:38,841 --> 00:07:41,341
These days, it's a bit worrying 

224
00:07:41,341 --> 00:07:44,741
to travel around Indonesia. 

225
00:07:44,741 --> 00:07:49,775
But Bandung is quite far from the disaster. 

226
00:07:50,475 --> 00:07:54,708
So we didn't have to be concerned about safety. 

227
00:07:54,708 --> 00:07:56,841
It's not a region where earthquakes happen often. 

228
00:07:56,841 --> 00:07:58,808
- Right. / - In terms of the geography. 

229
00:07:59,108 --> 00:08:01,075
- Then, shall we go first? / - Yes. 

230
00:08:01,075 --> 00:08:02,175
What's your team name? 

231
00:08:02,175 --> 00:08:05,375
We are SuDa Signal! 

232

00:08:32,775 --> 00:08:35,208
(Daeun became famous through a reality dating show) 

244

She's the guest host on Friday. 

246
00:08:41,308 --> 00:08:44,775
(Suji and Daeun became close meeting every week) 

247
00:08:45,475 --> 00:08:48,275
So we're becoming travel mates. 

248
00:08:48,275 --> 00:08:49,208
That's right. 

249
00:08:49,208 --> 00:08:52,775
- Gosh, I'm honored. / - I'm pleased to be with you. 

250

What is the place you wanted to go to the most? 

251
00:08:55,308 --> 00:08:58,075
I really wanted to go to Bali, 

252
00:08:58,075 --> 00:09:00,341
so I even bought the ticket about 3 times. 

253
00:09:00,341 --> 00:09:03,675
Really? I also wanted to go to Bali. 

254
00:09:03,675 --> 00:09:05,141
It's a famous vacation spot. 

255
00:09:05,141 --> 00:09:07,241
And Battle Trip went to Bali before. 

256
00:09:07,241 --> 00:09:09,141
- That's right. / - The married couple special. 

257
00:09:09,141 --> 00:09:11,075
I wanted to try the swing. 

258
00:09:11,075 --> 00:09:12,908
That's where you can take the best shots. 

259
00:09:12,908 --> 00:09:14,841
It was with Park Jiyoon. 

260
00:09:14,841 --> 00:09:16,141
That looks so cool. 

261
00:09:16,141 --> 00:09:18,408
I want to take the best shot of my life there. 

262
00:09:18,408 --> 00:09:19,741
Like that? 

263
00:09:19,741 --> 00:09:22,341

- Taking good photos is important. / - You're right. 

265
00:09:23,908 --> 00:09:25,441

a beautiful place when I'm pretty... 

267
00:09:27,008 --> 00:09:29,608
- And leave a lot of good photos. / - Exactly. 

268
00:09:29,608 --> 00:09:31,008
- It's important. / - It's important. 

269
00:09:31,008 --> 00:09:32,008

- We connected. / - It is very important. 

271
00:09:32,975 --> 00:09:33,608

I feel a bit of pressure. 

273
00:09:36,408 --> 00:09:39,008
- I was a special host of the show. / - You were. 

274
00:09:39,008 --> 00:09:41,408
I'm sure I have some tips. 

275
00:09:41,408 --> 00:09:45,208
In my opinion, we should focus on something new. 

276
00:09:45,208 --> 00:09:46,108
Something new? 

277
00:09:46,108 --> 00:09:47,541
That's right. 

278
00:09:48,608 --> 00:09:49,841
When we think of Indonesia... 

279
00:09:49,841 --> 00:09:50,941
- We think of Bali. / - Right. 

280
00:09:50,941 --> 00:09:54,008
- It's a very typical place to go. / - It's true. 

281
00:09:54,308 --> 00:09:56,408
We should show them something new. 

282
00:09:56,408 --> 00:09:57,875
We should make people think, 

283
00:09:57,875 --> 00:09:59,208
"They went there? 

284
00:09:59,208 --> 00:10:00,141
There's such a place in Indonesia?" 

285
00:10:00,141 --> 00:10:01,975
We should find a place that makes people say that. 

286
00:10:02,975 --> 00:10:05,075
The Asian Games were recently held in Indonesia. 

287
00:10:05,275 --> 00:10:07,408
- They were held in Jakarta. / - Right. 

288
00:10:07,408 --> 00:10:09,608
No one has gone to Jakarta, right? 

289
00:10:09,608 --> 00:10:12,108
No one has. Let's check out the cities of Indonesia. 

290
00:10:12,108 --> 00:10:14,975
Major cities in Indonesia are Jakarta. 

291

- Yes. / - Right? 

298
00:10:29,575 --> 00:10:31,741

- How about Tegal? / - Cirebon, Bandung... 

300

The Bandung match. 

303
00:10:41,241 --> 00:10:44,241
Indonesia... Suji, I'll search 

304
00:10:44,241 --> 00:10:46,275
hashtags on social media. 

305
00:10:46,275 --> 00:10:47,808
- Okay. / - It's a country of islands. 

306
00:10:47,975 --> 00:10:49,008
(Searching the posts with the related hashtags) 

307
00:10:49,308 --> 00:10:51,375
People search with hashtags these days. 

308
00:10:51,375 --> 00:10:52,608
Then you spend an hour looking at 

309
00:10:52,608 --> 00:10:53,608
other people's best photos. 

310
00:10:53,608 --> 00:10:55,875

Look at this. 

328

What is that? 

329
00:11:28,875 --> 00:11:30,441
There's a mountain in the background. 

330
00:11:30,575 --> 00:11:31,608
Try to look beautiful. 

331
00:11:33,441 --> 00:11:36,175

(Will she get to take an awesome picture?) 

335
00:11:41,541 --> 00:11:42,808
She looks terrified. 

336
00:11:43,641 --> 00:11:45,441
That looks like a penalty. 

337
00:11:46,041 --> 00:11:48,175
- Look at her. / - This is a penalty. 

338
00:11:48,841 --> 00:11:50,041
This is unbelievable. 

339
00:11:50,041 --> 00:11:52,408
(Will they manage to take great pictures?) 

340
00:11:52,908 --> 00:11:54,641
- It looks amazing. / - Suji, let's go here. 

341
00:11:55,075 --> 00:11:57,075

(They sing together) 

343
00:12:00,575 --> 00:12:02,541
- We should do this. / - You be Princess Jasmine. 

344

- Okay. / - I'll be Aladdin. 

345

- So this is in Bandung? / - Yes, it's in Bandung.

Let's do this. Let's search Bandung. 

348
00:12:11,375 --> 00:12:14,108
Welcome to the fantastic city, Bandung. 

349
00:12:14,108 --> 00:12:16,041
- Is that grass? / - Yes. 

350
00:12:16,041 --> 00:12:18,241
- Real grass? / - Doesn't it look like a theme park? 

351
00:12:18,241 --> 00:12:20,241
Is that real grass? 

352
00:12:20,908 --> 00:12:24,875
(Indonesia is on the equator and it's usually very hot) 

353
00:12:24,875 --> 00:12:28,675
(But Bandung is in the upper regions) 

354
00:12:28,675 --> 00:12:30,908
The average yearly temperature is 22.3℃. 

355
00:12:30,908 --> 00:12:32,575
It should be just like here now. 

356
00:12:32,575 --> 00:12:34,708
That sounds great. I can't stand hot weather. 

357
00:12:35,041 --> 00:12:38,441
Check this out. It almost looks European. 

358
00:12:38,441 --> 00:12:39,775
Look at the flowers. 

359
00:12:39,775 --> 00:12:40,941
(An exotic city with European style buildings) 

360
00:12:40,941 --> 00:12:42,475
- They have European buildings. / - It's like Europe. 

361
00:12:42,775 --> 00:12:44,841
- It's so pretty. / - It's pretty, isn't it? 

362
00:12:44,841 --> 00:12:47,241
- It really is. / - It's really nice to take pictures. 

363
00:12:50,975 --> 00:12:54,741
It developed into a tourist city by the Dutch. 

364
00:12:54,741 --> 00:12:56,741
That's why. 

365
00:12:57,375 --> 00:12:59,375
- It was colonized by the Netherlands. / - The history... 

366
00:12:59,375 --> 00:13:02,141
Helps us understand a lot of things. 

367
00:13:02,141 --> 00:13:04,141
Daeun, do you have any suggestions? 

368
00:13:04,141 --> 00:13:06,575
Suji, Daeun. 

369
00:13:06,975 --> 00:13:08,241
- SuDa? / - SuDa? 

370
00:13:08,241 --> 00:13:10,208
How about SuDa Signal? 

371
00:13:11,008 --> 00:13:13,008
SuDa Signal? That doesn't sound bad. 

372
00:13:13,008 --> 00:13:14,741
SuDa Signal. 

373
00:13:14,741 --> 00:13:15,941
- Do you like it? / - Should we go with that? 

374
00:13:15,941 --> 00:13:17,008
How do you send a signal? 

375
00:13:17,008 --> 00:13:18,275
Was it like this? 

376
00:13:18,441 --> 00:13:19,808
(They decided on SuDa Signal for their team name) 

377
00:13:19,808 --> 00:13:21,875
I like it. Then how about... 

378
00:13:21,875 --> 00:13:25,408
We rate each other's tour at the end of the day... 

379
00:13:25,408 --> 00:13:26,875
- By sending a signal? / - Aren't we being too strict... 

380
00:13:26,875 --> 00:13:28,375
- On each other? / - No, no. 

381
00:13:28,375 --> 00:13:30,008
We're a team. We shouldn't be strict on each other. 

382
00:13:30,008 --> 00:13:32,808
Yet, we should stay objective. 

383
00:13:33,675 --> 00:13:35,475
What is this? 

384
00:13:35,475 --> 00:13:36,308
Goodness. 

385
00:13:36,308 --> 00:13:37,641
It was so delicious. 

386
00:13:37,641 --> 00:13:39,741
I'm not kidding, it's so good. 

387
00:13:39,741 --> 00:13:41,475
(Daeun loves food more than Suji does) 

388
00:13:42,875 --> 00:13:46,775
(Daeun will be in charge of eating show) 

389
00:13:46,775 --> 00:13:48,808
- She can eat a lot. / - She's really something. 

390
00:13:48,808 --> 00:13:51,441
- We won. / - She eats a lot. 

391
00:13:51,441 --> 00:13:53,775
- The quiet eater type. / - She's basically inhaling. 

392
00:13:54,741 --> 00:13:57,241
(She's cute and sexy at the same time) 

393
00:13:58,541 --> 00:14:02,275
(Princess Suji will be in charge of loveliness) 

394
00:14:03,075 --> 00:14:06,275
(A trip with Suji and Daeun) 

395
00:14:07,741 --> 00:14:11,008
(Let's discover Bandung with SuDa Signal Tour) 

396
00:14:12,741 --> 00:14:14,308
(Incheon International Airport) 

397
00:14:15,375 --> 00:14:16,641
Off we go. 

398
00:14:16,941 --> 00:14:18,675
(It's time to check in) 

399
00:14:18,675 --> 00:14:20,775
I love this place. 

400
00:14:20,775 --> 00:14:22,475
- It makes you excited. / - It does. 

401
00:14:22,475 --> 00:14:23,741
It's the most exciting moment. 

402
00:14:23,741 --> 00:14:24,775
Checking in your luggage. 

403
00:14:25,641 --> 00:14:28,808
(Heading off to board the 5:15 p.m. plane) 

404
00:14:29,341 --> 00:14:34,375
(After a 7-hour flight, they arrive in Jakarta) 

405
00:14:42,808 --> 00:14:46,041
- It isn't over. / - It isn't. 

406
00:14:46,041 --> 00:14:47,675
The air is hot. 

407
00:14:48,341 --> 00:14:51,341
In the plane, the pilot made an announcement. 

408
00:14:51,341 --> 00:14:55,275
"The current temperature in Jakarta is 29℃." 

409
00:14:55,275 --> 00:14:58,441
"I wish you a nice trip." This is what he said. 

410
00:14:58,508 --> 00:15:00,641
You said it takes 35 minutes by airplane... 

411
00:15:00,641 --> 00:15:04,641
- And 3 hours by bus or train. / - That's right. 

412
00:15:04,641 --> 00:15:07,341
Since we don't have much time, let's keep going. 

413
00:15:07,341 --> 00:15:08,541
We'll take a night bus. 

414
00:15:08,541 --> 00:15:10,275
- It'll take from 3 hours... / - We arrived late. 

415
00:15:10,275 --> 00:15:12,275
- To 3.5 hours. / - So we're taking a bus. 

416
00:15:12,275 --> 00:15:13,575
We need to travel further. 

417
00:15:13,575 --> 00:15:16,708
This is the way to the bus stop. 

418
00:15:17,808 --> 00:15:19,241
Ticket, Bandung? 

419
00:15:19,241 --> 00:15:21,175
Yeah, Bandung. Two people. 

420
00:15:21,741 --> 00:15:22,575
(From 7:30 a.m. to 12 a.m.) 

421
00:15:22,575 --> 00:15:23,575
(Bus comes every 30 minutes) 

422
00:15:23,575 --> 00:15:25,541
11:59 p.m.? 

423
00:15:26,541 --> 00:15:28,875
115 rupiah. 

424
00:15:28,875 --> 00:15:31,375
I was shocked because I thought it was $115, 

425
00:15:31,375 --> 00:15:33,375
but it's just $8.50. 

426
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:34,741
$8.50. 

427
00:15:35,575 --> 00:15:37,608
(They finally get on the bus to Bandung) 

428
00:15:37,608 --> 00:15:39,575
The seats are very comfortable. 

429
00:15:40,441 --> 00:15:42,241
It was a very comfortable bus. 

430
00:15:42,741 --> 00:15:44,175
The seats were very comfortable.

(They leave Soekarno-Hatta International Airport) 

432
00:15:47,708 --> 00:15:48,875
You should've slept on the bus. 

433
00:15:48,875 --> 00:15:51,108
- We slept a bit. / - We slept sound. 

434
00:15:51,108 --> 00:15:52,375
(3.5 hours to Bandung Bus Terminal) 

435
00:15:53,641 --> 00:15:56,975
It's embarrassing to be holding a camera now. 

436
00:15:56,975 --> 00:15:58,608
We finally arrived in... 

437
00:15:58,608 --> 00:16:00,541
- Bandung. / - Bandung. 

438
00:16:01,108 --> 00:16:03,808

00:16:12,208 --> 00:16:14,341
- And cool. / - Let's make ourselves look pretty. 

444
00:16:14,341 --> 00:16:16,041
As you know, tomorrow is Suji's Day. 

445
00:16:16,041 --> 00:16:17,175

So pretty! 

452
00:16:31,575 --> 00:16:33,308
So elegant.

This tastes so good. 

456
00:16:43,341 --> 00:16:44,775
Hot place.

459
00:16:49,808 --> 00:16:52,075

464
00:17:12,408 --> 00:17:15,108
(Bandung's morning is busy) 

465
00:17:21,008 --> 00:17:23,908
(Due to the high altitude, the city is full of green) 

466
00:17:23,908 --> 00:17:25,708
It's unique. It's like a city... 

467
00:17:25,708 --> 00:17:27,175
- But there are also mountains. / - That's right. 

468

I had no idea Bandung had such nice weather. 

477

Since Bandung is in a high altitude region... 

478
00:17:48,708 --> 00:17:50,775
- It's not so hot. / - I was wearing long sleeves...

This is the best Southeast Asian city I've been to.

It's the best. It's so dry. I must record this. 

483
00:18:01,375 --> 00:18:04,008
Look at how dry it is. Bandung is a blessed city. 

484
00:18:04,008 --> 00:18:06,841
Suji, by the way, why are we here 

485
00:18:06,841 --> 00:18:08,275
early in the morning?

- The door is wide open. / - So pretty. 

502
00:18:43,141 --> 00:18:45,975

- 80 cents? / - Yes, 80 cents. 

504
00:18:48,141 --> 00:18:50,141
We're going to take the yellow bus. 

505
00:18:50,141 --> 00:18:52,408

509
00:18:59,341 --> 00:19:00,908
- Okay. / - This is how you get on it. 

510
00:19:02,408 --> 00:19:04,875
(With Daeun's escort, Princess Suji gets on the bus) 

511
00:19:08,341 --> 00:19:09,975
- It's open here as well. / - What is that? 

512
00:19:09,975 --> 00:19:11,341
It's pretty.

It's very pretty. 

514
00:19:12,475 --> 00:19:14,408
How are you? 

515
00:19:14,408 --> 00:19:16,375
That's an Indonesian greeting. 

516
00:19:16,375 --> 00:19:18,041

(Many European-style buildings were built by the Dutch) 

550
00:20:39,941 --> 00:20:41,608
(Who have begun to plan the development of Bandung) 

551
00:20:41,608 --> 00:20:44,708

They made sure even a crosswalk was artistic. 

556
00:20:58,208 --> 00:20:59,841

Doesn't it look like a clock tower? 

568
00:21:37,775 --> 00:21:40,041
- It's the Eiffel Tower. / - Daeun. 

569
00:21:40,041 --> 00:21:41,408
I said I wanted to go to Bandung. 

570
00:21:41,408 --> 00:21:43,441
Why did you bring me to Paris? 

571
00:21:43,441 --> 00:21:45,541
Bandung has a nickname. 

572
00:21:45,541 --> 00:21:47,708

00:21:53,675 --> 00:21:56,308
In Korea, we have the Miss Korea beauty pageant. 

577
00:21:56,308 --> 00:21:59,141
There also is a beauty pageant in Indonesia. 

578
00:21:59,141 --> 00:22:00,875
A lot of winners are from Bandung. 

579
00:22:00,875 --> 00:22:02,041

00:22:21,375 --> 00:22:24,708
(It's a cafe and a restaurant for their first meal) 

591
00:22:24,941 --> 00:22:26,341
Let's go into this Art Cafe. 

592
00:22:26,341 --> 00:22:27,741
I can't wait. 

593
00:22:27,741 --> 00:22:30,075
This part has the bar. 

594
00:22:30,308 --> 00:22:32,075
At night, you can have drinks here. 

595
00:22:32,075 --> 00:22:34,008

596
00:22:34,008 --> 00:22:35,208

00:22:38,008 --> 00:22:40,008
- They would look vintage. / - It's so pretty. 

599
00:22:40,008 --> 00:22:40,908

600
00:22:40,908 --> 00:22:43,341
- Daeun, there's a 2nd floor too. / - Such a pretty cafe. 

601
00:22:43,341 --> 00:22:44,675
It was so pretty. 

602
00:22:44,675 --> 00:22:45,708
My goodness. 

603
00:22:46,408 --> 00:22:48,775
Welcome. This is the garden. 

604
00:22:48,775 --> 00:22:50,541
- It's nature itself. / - Exactly. 

605
00:22:50,541 --> 00:22:53,408
This is the most suitable cafe to relax on this trip. 

606
00:22:53,408 --> 00:22:54,408
True nature. 

607
00:22:55,408 --> 00:22:57,375
How did you find this cafe? 

608
00:22:58,208 --> 00:23:01,441
(They will enjoy an Indonesian lunch here) 

609
00:23:01,441 --> 00:23:03,375
Southeast Asian cuisine... Wow. 

610
00:23:05,241 --> 00:23:07,208
- We should sit here. / - Should we? 

611
00:23:07,208 --> 00:23:09,108
It's sunny on this side. 

612
00:23:09,708 --> 00:23:11,908
Here's my princess. 

613
00:23:12,641 --> 00:23:14,075
Here we go. 

614
00:23:15,941 --> 00:23:17,541
(Photos in the garden of a city center) 

615
00:23:17,541 --> 00:23:19,508
The photos turn out great here. 

616
00:23:20,241 --> 00:23:21,841
Isn't it so pretty? 

617
00:23:21,841 --> 00:23:23,008
It's so pretty. 

618
00:23:23,441 --> 00:23:26,208
- You look great. / - Each photo is a work of art. 

619
00:23:26,641 --> 00:23:30,208
You look so pretty. You're beautiful. 

620
00:23:30,741 --> 00:23:34,475
Every photo here looks like an art. 

621
00:23:34,941 --> 00:23:37,275
- What do you think? / - I'm very satisfied. 

622
00:23:37,275 --> 00:23:38,441
- You're very satisfied? / - Yes. 

623
00:23:38,441 --> 00:23:41,408
First off, we need to have our meal at a nice place. 

624
00:23:41,408 --> 00:23:43,608
That's how we'll get to enjoy it. 

625
00:23:43,608 --> 00:23:46,408
Let's get some food since we're hungry. 

626
00:23:46,408 --> 00:23:47,775
I'm so hungry. 

627
00:23:47,775 --> 00:23:50,375
- Hello. / - Hello. 

628
00:23:50,608 --> 00:23:51,941
- Recommend? / - Okay. 

629
00:23:52,408 --> 00:23:56,141
Fried rice... And mie goreng. 

630
00:23:56,141 --> 00:23:57,241
"Nasi" means rice. 

631
00:23:57,241 --> 00:23:59,741
"Mie" means noodles. "Goreng" means stir-fry. 

632
00:24:00,108 --> 00:24:01,441
It's stir-fried rice and noodles. 

633
00:24:02,408 --> 00:24:05,608
- You have to eat nasi goreng. / - You must. 

634
00:24:05,608 --> 00:24:07,241
Three. Okay. 

635
00:24:07,241 --> 00:24:10,075
- It's just the two of us but we eat like three. / - Okay. 

636
00:24:10,075 --> 00:24:11,341
Do you like spicy? 

637
00:24:11,775 --> 00:24:13,475
- I like it. / - No, no. 

638
00:24:13,475 --> 00:24:14,975
- A little bit? / - No, no. 

639
00:24:14,975 --> 00:24:16,575
- Normal, normal. / - Okay. 

640
00:24:16,575 --> 00:24:18,475
- It already sounds delicious. / - When you're abroad... 

641
00:24:18,708 --> 00:24:22,241
Very spicy isn't that spicy for Koreans. 

642
00:24:22,241 --> 00:24:26,541
That restaurant was famous for spicy food. 

643
00:24:26,541 --> 00:24:31,008
That's why we asked for a normal level of spiciness. 

644
00:24:31,008 --> 00:24:32,141
If you order everything with just that. 

645
00:24:32,141 --> 00:24:33,308
This place has to taste good for Koreans. 

646
00:24:33,308 --> 00:24:34,808
It'll be good no matter what. 

647
00:24:35,341 --> 00:24:37,041
(Nasi goreng, $2, braised short ribs, $4.20) 

648
00:24:37,041 --> 00:24:38,741
(Mie goreng, $2.20, 2 cups of mango juice, $3.20) 

649
00:24:40,108 --> 00:24:41,741

650
00:24:41,741 --> 00:24:43,808
- That looks so good. / - It's mie goreng. 

651
00:24:43,808 --> 00:24:45,441
(And there's mie goreng too) 

652
00:24:46,708 --> 00:24:48,141
Goodness, that looks really good. 

653
00:24:48,308 --> 00:24:52,575
This is very spicy. Extra spicy. This is a little spicy. 

654
00:24:53,008 --> 00:24:54,441
- Very spicy? / - Yes. 

655
00:24:54,441 --> 00:24:56,808
- Okay. Thank you. / - Thank you. 

656
00:24:57,341 --> 00:24:58,675
Which one should we try first? 

657
00:24:59,508 --> 00:25:01,508
- You didn't order that much. / - Let's eat. 

658
00:25:01,508 --> 00:25:03,475
- It's nasi goreng. / - That's right. 

659
00:25:03,475 --> 00:25:05,675
- It's a representative dish. / - Exactly. 

660
00:25:05,675 --> 00:25:07,775
- Let's try nasi goreng first. / - Nasi goreng? 

661
00:25:07,775 --> 00:25:10,141
- $2.20. / - It was only $2.20. 

662
00:25:10,841 --> 00:25:12,575
I can smell the spiciness. 

663
00:25:12,575 --> 00:25:14,741
Yes, I can feel it right away. 

664
00:25:14,741 --> 00:25:15,775
Let me try it. 

665
00:25:15,775 --> 00:25:19,575
(How does it taste?) 

666
00:25:22,608 --> 00:25:24,375
- This is spicy. / - It's that spicy? 

667
00:25:24,375 --> 00:25:25,441
- Is it really spicy? / - Seriously? 

668
00:25:25,441 --> 00:25:27,608
What was the level of spiciness we chose? 

669
00:25:28,208 --> 00:25:29,441
I thought it was normal. 

670
00:25:29,441 --> 00:25:31,541
- We asked for normal. / - Wasn't it normal? 

671
00:25:31,541 --> 00:25:33,575
But they gave us very spicy. 

672
00:25:33,575 --> 00:25:36,441
You can choose the level of spiciness. 

673
00:25:36,441 --> 00:25:38,441
If you can't handle spicy food... 

674
00:25:38,708 --> 00:25:40,308
Just pick the least spicy one. 

675
00:25:40,308 --> 00:25:42,241
- Even Koreans have to... / - Really? 

676
00:25:42,241 --> 00:25:43,775
- Choose the least spicy level? / - Yes. 

677
00:25:43,775 --> 00:25:45,275
I guess it's really spicy. 

678
00:25:46,841 --> 00:25:49,141
From the second spoonful, 

679
00:25:49,141 --> 00:25:50,008
I can taste its authentic flavors 

680
00:25:50,008 --> 00:25:51,341
instead of just spiciness. 

681
00:25:51,341 --> 00:25:55,308
I like this dish because it doesn't have a lot of spices. 

682
00:25:55,308 --> 00:25:56,808
It's not overwhelming. 

683
00:25:56,808 --> 00:25:58,008
Of course, it'd be delicious. 

684
00:25:58,008 --> 00:26:00,475
- Try it with the rice. / - I'll just drink water. 

685
00:26:00,475 --> 00:26:02,541
(They try it with the Indonesian chip this time) 

686
00:26:03,075 --> 00:26:04,241
- Is it good? / - Seriously. 

687
00:26:04,408 --> 00:26:06,341
- You know shrimp snacks in Korea? / - Yes. 

688
00:26:06,341 --> 00:26:07,508
- It tastes like that. / - It's delicious. 

689
00:26:07,508 --> 00:26:09,041
- We don't need spoons. / - That's delicious. 

690
00:26:09,341 --> 00:26:10,675
You don't need spoons. 

691
00:26:10,675 --> 00:26:12,841
(You can use the crispy snack as your spoon) 

692
00:26:12,841 --> 00:26:14,341
- You can eat that spoon. / - She's like a local. 

693
00:26:14,341 --> 00:26:15,741
The chip is really good. 

694
00:26:16,241 --> 00:26:18,941
The salty shrimp chip and spicy rice go well together. 

695
00:26:20,508 --> 00:26:23,175
- We'll try the mie goreng. / - Mie goreng. 

696
00:26:23,475 --> 00:26:25,675
- I was curious about this dish. / - Stir-fried noodles. 

697
00:26:25,675 --> 00:26:26,975
It's like instant noodles. 

698
00:26:26,975 --> 00:26:29,175
- Stir-fried noodles. / - It only costs $2.20. 

699
00:26:29,641 --> 00:26:31,875
- Mie goreng. / - Goodness, it's so cheap. 

700
00:26:31,875 --> 00:26:34,375
(They twirl the noodles and eat in one bite) 

701
00:26:34,375 --> 00:26:36,308
The noodles were really chewy. 

702
00:26:36,841 --> 00:26:38,541
You know the seasoning in instant noodle snack? 

703
00:26:38,541 --> 00:26:39,941
It tastes just like that. 

704
00:26:39,941 --> 00:26:40,941
You're right. 

705
00:26:41,741 --> 00:26:43,641
- I really like this dish. / - Same here. 

706
00:26:44,841 --> 00:26:46,475
I'll try it with the egg. 

707
00:26:46,475 --> 00:26:47,841
It'll go so well together. 

708
00:26:47,841 --> 00:26:50,475
- Eat with the egg. / - That looks great. 

709
00:26:51,208 --> 00:26:52,275
How is it? 

710
00:26:54,541 --> 00:26:56,341
- Take that out now. Hurry. / - Why? 

711
00:26:56,841 --> 00:26:58,575
- It's not good? / - The noodles alone taste better. 

712
00:26:58,575 --> 00:27:00,775
Just enjoy the taste of the noodles alone? 

713
00:27:00,775 --> 00:27:02,575
Aren't you stopping me so you can eat it alone? 

714
00:27:03,008 --> 00:27:05,341
I knew it, you brat. 

715
00:27:07,575 --> 00:27:08,941
Let me try it. 

716
00:27:08,941 --> 00:27:09,941
I didn't want her to eat it. 

717
00:27:09,941 --> 00:27:11,708
You wanted to keep all the good food to yourself? 

718
00:27:12,475 --> 00:27:14,375
You thought Suji wouldn't eat it? 

719
00:27:14,675 --> 00:27:16,741
(This is so delicious!) 

720
00:27:16,741 --> 00:27:19,275
Why did you try to stop me? 

721
00:27:19,975 --> 00:27:21,508
It's really delicious. 

722
00:27:21,508 --> 00:27:23,141
- Everything was tasty. / - I thought so too. 

723
00:27:23,141 --> 00:27:25,041
- Really? / - It's to die for. 

724
00:27:25,041 --> 00:27:26,441
Let's try the braised short ribs. 

725
00:27:26,975 --> 00:27:30,141
(Indonesian-style braised short ribs, $4.20) 

726
00:27:31,075 --> 00:27:33,475
- That dish, my goodness. / - That was so good. 

727
00:27:33,475 --> 00:27:35,341
- Really? / - That one was a bit expensive. 

728
00:27:35,341 --> 00:27:36,441
- It was 50,000 something. / - Braised short ribs? 

729
00:27:36,441 --> 00:27:37,908
- Braised short ribs? / - It's $4.20. 

730
00:27:37,908 --> 00:27:40,275
- What? $4.20? / - Those are oxtails. 

731
00:27:40,341 --> 00:27:42,475
- $4.20 for short ribs. / - Yes. 

732
00:27:42,475 --> 00:27:43,475
That looks good. 

733
00:27:43,475 --> 00:27:46,241
- Let me eat from the bone. / - Okay. 

734
00:27:47,441 --> 00:27:50,075
(The meat falls off the bone) 

735
00:27:52,708 --> 00:27:55,108
It's chewy. What is this? How could it be so chewy? 

736
00:27:55,108 --> 00:27:57,741
- It's oxtail. / - That has to be delicious. 

737
00:27:57,741 --> 00:27:59,275
It was so tender. 

738
00:27:59,308 --> 00:28:00,908
- But it's $4.20. / - Yes. 

739
00:28:00,908 --> 00:28:02,841
Let's try this with rice. 

740
00:28:02,841 --> 00:28:05,008
This is braised with the sauce nicely. 

741
00:28:05,008 --> 00:28:08,208
- And it's very tender. / - It's tender. It looks so good. 

742
00:28:09,041 --> 00:28:10,975
Let me try it like this. 

743
00:28:10,975 --> 00:28:12,608
(Daeun will try the chip, rice and meat together) 

744
00:28:12,608 --> 00:28:14,675
- Let me have a bite of this. / - Okay. 

745
00:28:16,475 --> 00:28:17,608
(Crunch) 

746
00:28:22,841 --> 00:28:25,841
The chip we had earlier and this one taste different. 

747
00:28:25,841 --> 00:28:28,741
- This tastes like a corn chip. / - Really? 

748
00:28:28,741 --> 00:28:31,241
- Even the colors seem different. / - Yeah. 

749
00:28:31,975 --> 00:28:33,408
- Corn chip? / - Yes. 

750
00:28:33,408 --> 00:28:35,741
You can really smell it. 

751
00:28:36,575 --> 00:28:39,041
- It neutralizes the spices. / - It neutralizes the aroma. 

752
00:28:39,041 --> 00:28:40,341
Okay. Then I'll try it with this. 

753
00:28:42,308 --> 00:28:43,575
Listen to that. 

754
00:28:43,575 --> 00:28:45,341
Exactly. It's a corn chip too. 

755
00:28:46,041 --> 00:28:47,841
Right? It neutralizes the smell. 

756
00:28:47,841 --> 00:28:49,041
- It's savory. / - Yes. 

757
00:28:49,041 --> 00:28:50,675
They also give you soup with that. 

758
00:28:51,541 --> 00:28:54,575
- It's kind of like short rib soup. / - I see. 

759
00:28:55,341 --> 00:28:58,408
Let me try the meat with the soup together. 

760
00:28:58,408 --> 00:28:59,641
That sounds good. 

761
00:28:59,641 --> 00:29:01,875
- That looks good. / - You have to dunk it in the soup. 

762
00:29:04,375 --> 00:29:05,408
To make it moist. 

763
00:29:06,675 --> 00:29:07,708
Is it perfect? 

764
00:29:07,708 --> 00:29:10,475
It's perfect. This tastes all different 

765
00:29:10,475 --> 00:29:13,141
when you eat just the meat, with the chip 

766
00:29:13,141 --> 00:29:14,141
and with the soup. 

767
00:29:14,141 --> 00:29:16,275
- It depends on how you eat it. / - It tastes different. 

768
00:29:16,375 --> 00:29:17,475
With the soup. 

769
00:29:17,475 --> 00:29:19,275
(The meat is dunked into the broth) 

770
00:29:19,275 --> 00:29:21,675
(It makes the meat even more tender) 

771
00:29:21,675 --> 00:29:22,941
It tastes different, right? 

772
00:29:23,241 --> 00:29:25,175
- Suji is doing well. / - If she's frowning like that... 

773
00:29:25,175 --> 00:29:26,575
It means it's really good. 

774
00:29:26,575 --> 00:29:29,041
I can just swallow the meat as is. 

775
00:29:29,041 --> 00:29:30,408
No need to chew. 

776
00:29:30,608 --> 00:29:31,675
It's so delicious. 

777
00:29:32,408 --> 00:29:35,008
(That was a good meal, I'm full) 

778
00:29:36,008 --> 00:29:38,675
We're not done yet. 

779
00:29:38,975 --> 00:29:41,208
Dip it in the egg yolk. 

780
00:29:42,475 --> 00:29:44,108
She's just getting started. 

781
00:29:44,108 --> 00:29:45,608
Seriously. 

782
00:29:46,875 --> 00:29:48,075
(Shaking her head) 

783
00:29:48,441 --> 00:29:51,441
Could you please fast forward the video? 

784
00:29:51,441 --> 00:29:52,775
The part when she's eating. 

785
00:29:52,775 --> 00:29:53,508
(She gracefully moves her fork and spoon) 

786
00:29:57,041 --> 00:29:59,508
- And the soup... / - You eat so well. 

787
00:29:59,508 --> 00:30:01,708
I felt bad, so I stopped eating. 

788
00:30:01,708 --> 00:30:04,208
Suji, I expected you to eat more. 

789
00:30:04,208 --> 00:30:06,841
I'm a sprinter and she's a marathoner. 

790
00:30:09,975 --> 00:30:12,075
- We're satisfied with our meal. / - Yes. 

791
00:30:12,308 --> 00:30:14,708
We're full, so what should we do? 

792
00:30:14,708 --> 00:30:16,341
We need to digest. 

793
00:30:16,341 --> 00:30:18,041
What should we do to digest? 

794
00:30:18,041 --> 00:30:18,941
(Sending her a signal) 

795
00:30:20,108 --> 00:30:21,108
Cafe? 

796
00:30:21,741 --> 00:30:22,941
- Shopping? / - You got it. 

797
00:30:23,841 --> 00:30:24,941
Shopping? 

798
00:30:26,341 --> 00:30:28,008
We'll shop Bandung style. 

799
00:30:28,008 --> 00:30:29,941
- Bandung style? / - I'm curious. 

800
00:30:29,941 --> 00:30:31,808
(Bandung Tour, Suji's Day) 

801
00:30:31,808 --> 00:30:39,775
(Floating market) 

802
00:30:40,141 --> 00:30:45,741
(The market is 45 minutes away by car) 

803
00:30:45,741 --> 00:30:47,875
- Now that we're full... / - Yes. 

804
00:30:47,875 --> 00:30:50,541
We need to walk a little bit. 

805
00:30:50,541 --> 00:30:52,475
- Shopping. / - Shopping. 

806
00:30:52,475 --> 00:30:54,241
We need to shop. 

807
00:30:54,241 --> 00:30:56,008
We'll buy stuff 

808
00:30:56,008 --> 00:30:58,575
and eat some street food too. 

809
00:30:58,575 --> 00:31:00,741
We'll have some dessert there. 

810
00:31:00,741 --> 00:31:02,208
I'm curious about the floating market. 

811
00:31:02,208 --> 00:31:05,275
It's not your typical floating market. 

812
00:31:05,275 --> 00:31:06,575
The space is huge. 

813
00:31:06,575 --> 00:31:09,008
- It's so nice. / - It is. 

814
00:31:09,008 --> 00:31:10,308

816
00:31:13,641 --> 00:31:15,508
Wow, that looks good. 

817
00:31:15,508 --> 00:31:16,775
That was good. 

818
00:31:18,841 --> 00:31:20,341
- Look at that. / - What's that? 

819
00:31:20,341 --> 00:31:21,775
- It's a steamed bun. / - Take a look. 

820
00:31:21,775 --> 00:31:23,441
Look how popular that place is. 

821
00:31:23,441 --> 00:31:25,175
It's a floating market, 

822
00:31:25,175 --> 00:31:28,275
but it's a tourist area with a lot to see. 

823
00:31:28,275 --> 00:31:30,008
- That's hanbok. / - It's great for dates. 

824
00:31:30,008 --> 00:31:31,208
It's like an amusement park. 

825
00:31:31,208 --> 00:31:32,375
- Wasn't that hanbok? / - It's like an amusement park. 

826
00:31:32,375 --> 00:31:35,175
They wear hanbok and BTS songs are played there. 

827
00:31:35,175 --> 00:31:37,908
Lots of BIGBANG and BTS songs. 

828
00:31:37,908 --> 00:31:39,608
They had a lot of interest in Korea. 

829
00:31:39,608 --> 00:31:40,741
That's interesting. 

830
00:31:41,108 --> 00:31:43,041
- Daeun, look at that. / - Yes. 

831
00:31:43,275 --> 00:31:44,341
What are those? 

832
00:31:44,341 --> 00:31:46,741
- It says floating market, right? / - Yes. 

833
00:31:47,108 --> 00:31:48,341
I'll tell you what it is. 

834
00:31:48,341 --> 00:31:50,508
In this market, 

835
00:31:50,508 --> 00:31:52,641
you have to use those tokens. 

836
00:31:52,641 --> 00:31:54,475
They have coins that are only used there. 

837
00:31:54,475 --> 00:31:55,941
Yes, like tokens. 

838
00:31:55,941 --> 00:31:58,675
The whole market is like a theme park. 

839
00:31:58,675 --> 00:32:00,708
We'll get some tokens 

840
00:32:00,708 --> 00:32:02,675
and buy some stuff. 

841
00:32:02,675 --> 00:32:05,775
On our right are souvenirs. 

842
00:32:06,408 --> 00:32:08,741
(Bandung specialty tea leaves) 

843
00:32:08,741 --> 00:32:10,641
Shall we do some shopping? 

844
00:32:10,641 --> 00:32:12,141

00:32:23,675 --> 00:32:25,775
- We should look at this shop. / - Shall we? 

851
00:32:26,875 --> 00:32:28,275
- I think this is pretty. / - That's pretty. 

852
00:32:30,441 --> 00:32:31,275
(She shops for her partner, Suji) 

853
00:32:31,275 --> 00:32:32,508
This skirt is nice too. 

854
00:32:34,208 --> 00:32:36,808
(She picks out a matching top for the skirt) 

855
00:32:38,541 --> 00:32:39,708
I found it. 

856
00:32:40,141 --> 00:32:41,475
It's really nice. 

857
00:32:42,141 --> 00:32:44,608
- I found a good one. / - That's really nice. 

858
00:32:45,275 --> 00:32:46,708
Isn't it really pretty? 

859
00:32:46,708 --> 00:32:48,841
Isn't it pretty? Come this way. 

860
00:32:49,608 --> 00:32:50,841
They're like mother and daughter. 

861
00:32:56,675 --> 00:32:59,608
(They're wearing fabulous Indonesian fashion) 

862
00:33:01,341 --> 00:33:03,075
- It's pretty. / - The fabric was really nice too. 

863
00:33:03,075 --> 00:33:06,308
(From head to toe, they're wearing a similar look) 

864
00:33:08,441 --> 00:33:11,875
Look! This is the floating market! 

865
00:33:12,341 --> 00:33:15,141
They're really floating on the water. 

866
00:33:15,541 --> 00:33:17,208
- Skewers. / - Skewers. 

867
00:33:18,041 --> 00:33:20,941
At first, when I heard it was a floating market.... 

868
00:33:20,941 --> 00:33:23,141
I thought we were going to ride a boat and shop. 

869
00:33:23,141 --> 00:33:24,608
The boats are just docked there. 

870
00:33:24,608 --> 00:33:27,508
- But it's the vendors. / - Their boats are docked. 

871
00:33:27,508 --> 00:33:28,608
Yeah. 

872
00:33:28,608 --> 00:33:30,908
- If we're going to buy food... / - Yes. 

873
00:33:30,908 --> 00:33:32,675
Do you see that? There's a money exchange. 

874
00:33:32,675 --> 00:33:36,108
Here, we'll exchange money, then we'll buy food. 

875
00:33:36,108 --> 00:33:37,675
- Let's exchange a lot. / - Okay. 

876
00:33:38,141 --> 00:33:39,608
Please exchange that. 

877
00:33:39,608 --> 00:33:42,441
(This much?) 

878
00:33:42,441 --> 00:33:43,641
She's surprised. 

879
00:33:43,641 --> 00:33:45,108
- "Will you eat that much?" / - That much? 

880
00:33:46,275 --> 00:33:47,808
That's a lot. 

881
00:33:47,808 --> 00:33:50,208
- The tokens can't be refunded. / - Right. 

882
00:33:50,208 --> 00:33:52,441
- Exchange only necessary amount. / - That's a shame. 

883
00:33:52,708 --> 00:33:54,941
So we just took the leftover tokens as souvenirs. 

884
00:33:56,441 --> 00:34:00,275
- That's the braised short ribs we had. / - We had it. 

885
00:34:00,275 --> 00:34:01,775
They have noodles too. 

886
00:34:01,775 --> 00:34:03,275
- That's nasi goreng. / - Goreng. 

887
00:34:03,975 --> 00:34:05,041
Durian! 

888
00:34:05,275 --> 00:34:06,375
- Durian. / - Durian. 

889
00:34:06,375 --> 00:34:08,808
I've had it once before. It was delicious. 

890
00:34:08,808 --> 00:34:11,575
- Durian is dangerous. / - Shall we try it as a dessert? 

891
00:34:11,575 --> 00:34:13,575
I've never had it before. 

892
00:34:13,575 --> 00:34:15,241
- Try it. / - I'll try it. 

893
00:34:15,241 --> 00:34:17,241
Oh, banana! 

894
00:34:17,241 --> 00:34:18,475
Fried banana. 

895
00:34:18,908 --> 00:34:21,408
It smells so sweet. 

896
00:34:21,608 --> 00:34:24,275
Good spots have people lined up, as expected. 

897
00:34:24,275 --> 00:34:25,808
- Let's line up. / - We'll wait. 

898
00:34:26,375 --> 00:34:28,308
(Fried banana looks good) 

899
00:34:29,075 --> 00:34:30,841
- I'm curious. / - It looks really good. 

900
00:34:31,441 --> 00:34:33,775
She keeps cutting the banana over there. 

901
00:34:34,075 --> 00:34:35,475
Ripe banana is so good. 

902
00:34:35,475 --> 00:34:37,641
- It's fried banana. / - That's 20,000 rupiah. 

903
00:34:38,408 --> 00:34:40,308
With cheese? 

904
00:34:40,308 --> 00:34:41,641
- I think it's cheese. / - Cheese? 

905
00:34:41,641 --> 00:34:43,975
- There's sauce too. / - Kaya sauce? 

906
00:34:43,975 --> 00:34:45,008
That should be delicious. 

907
00:34:45,008 --> 00:34:46,708
- It's kaya sauce. / - Kaya sauce. 

908
00:34:47,541 --> 00:34:49,308
- Okay. / - That looks amazing. 

909
00:34:49,308 --> 00:34:51,541
That's 20,000 rupiah, so it's $1.50. 

910
00:34:51,541 --> 00:34:54,108
- Yes, $1.50. / - Seriously. 

911
00:34:57,408 --> 00:34:59,108
- Isn't it really hot? / - Yes. 

912
00:34:59,575 --> 00:35:01,108
(Yummy) 

913
00:35:05,408 --> 00:35:09,075
It tastes like sweet potato with banana flavor. 

914
00:35:09,608 --> 00:35:12,575
Does it taste like sugar glazed sweet potato wedges? 

915
00:35:12,575 --> 00:35:14,241
It's kind of like sweet potato fries. 

916
00:35:15,475 --> 00:35:16,841
When they battered it... 

917
00:35:17,441 --> 00:35:19,341
The bananas looked white. 

918
00:35:19,475 --> 00:35:21,808
- It's yellow now, right? / - It's yellow inside. 

919
00:35:23,041 --> 00:35:24,341
This yellow sauce. 

920
00:35:24,941 --> 00:35:26,741
Doesn't it taste like mango? 

921
00:35:26,741 --> 00:35:28,675
This white stuff on top is... 

922
00:35:29,041 --> 00:35:30,441
Grated cheese. 

923
00:35:30,575 --> 00:35:32,841
This mango sauce tastes fresh. 

924
00:35:32,841 --> 00:35:33,941
Kaya sauce. 

925
00:35:35,541 --> 00:35:36,608
(She's into fried banana) 

926
00:35:36,608 --> 00:35:38,941
- I want a bite. / - It's fun to eat at a market. 

927
00:35:38,941 --> 00:35:43,208
- The sauce is so sweet. / - It's really good. 

928
00:35:46,908 --> 00:35:48,775
Let's pick some food. 

929
00:35:48,775 --> 00:35:51,441
- And sit down to eat. / - Sounds good. 

930
00:35:51,441 --> 00:35:52,641
Goodness. 

931
00:35:52,808 --> 00:35:54,241
Doraemon. 

932
00:35:54,241 --> 00:35:56,041
- Yes. / - So cute. 

933
00:35:56,041 --> 00:35:57,441
- It's so pretty. / - They're mini buns! 

934
00:35:57,441 --> 00:35:58,841
How can you eat that? 

935
00:35:59,941 --> 00:36:02,008
That's so cruel. How could you eat that? 

936
00:36:03,441 --> 00:36:05,275
(Character buns, $1.50 each) 

937
00:36:05,275 --> 00:36:07,741
Thank you. 

938
00:36:08,408 --> 00:36:10,541
- Skewers. / - Skewers. 

939
00:36:10,541 --> 00:36:12,275
Suji, skewers! 

940
00:36:12,441 --> 00:36:14,641
Gosh. It smells so good. 

941
00:36:14,708 --> 00:36:16,541
What's the best? What's popular? 

942
00:36:17,575 --> 00:36:19,208
- Skewers. / - That looks really good. 

943
00:36:19,208 --> 00:36:19,975
- That looks awesome. / - You can't walk past that. 

944
00:36:19,975 --> 00:36:21,975
They always smell so good. 

945
00:36:21,975 --> 00:36:23,675
This looks like chicken. 

946
00:36:24,508 --> 00:36:25,175
Chicken? 

947
00:36:26,441 --> 00:36:27,875
- Best menu. / - Chicken, rabbit. 

948
00:36:27,875 --> 00:36:29,641

950
00:36:32,041 --> 00:36:33,575
Rabbit? 

951
00:36:33,575 --> 00:36:35,341
I thought I heard it wrong. 

952
00:36:35,341 --> 00:36:36,408
Rabbit good? 

953
00:36:36,408 --> 00:36:37,475
(Shocked) 

954
00:36:40,175 --> 00:36:41,575
How do you do that with your brows? 

955
00:36:42,241 --> 00:36:43,475
- That's so funny. / - How do you do that? 

956
00:36:43,475 --> 00:36:45,041
Korean? Japanese? 

957
00:36:45,041 --> 00:36:47,208
- Korean? / - Korean. Yes. 

958
00:36:47,508 --> 00:36:49,041
You order rabbit? 

959
00:36:49,041 --> 00:36:50,641
- Rabbit? Yeah. / - Rabbit, good? 

960
00:36:50,641 --> 00:36:51,775
Rabbit's good. 

961
00:36:51,775 --> 00:36:52,941
- He recommended it. / - A lot of people eat rabbit... 

962
00:36:52,941 --> 00:36:54,475
- In Europe. / - Rabbit? 

963
00:36:55,108 --> 00:36:56,975
(He laughs at her facial expressions) 

964
00:36:57,775 --> 00:37:00,575
- Chicken? / - Yes, chicken. 

965
00:37:00,575 --> 00:37:01,808
Excuse me. 

966
00:37:01,808 --> 00:37:03,375
One rabbit. 

967
00:37:03,375 --> 00:37:04,508
One chicken. 

968
00:37:06,141 --> 00:37:07,608
Rabbit? 

969
00:37:07,608 --> 00:37:08,808
Do you want a piece? 

970
00:37:08,808 --> 00:37:10,508
- Really? Okay. / - Yes. 

971
00:37:10,508 --> 00:37:12,275
We'll share one skewer. 

972
00:37:13,641 --> 00:37:15,341
- It's rabbit. / - I'm curious. 

973
00:37:17,475 --> 00:37:19,075
- Thank you. / - Thank you. 

974
00:37:19,508 --> 00:37:21,208
(She slowly tastes it) 

975
00:37:21,208 --> 00:37:22,841
I think it'll taste like chicken. 

976
00:37:22,841 --> 00:37:24,841
I wouldn't think it was rabbit. 

977
00:37:24,841 --> 00:37:25,675
(Did you really eat it?) 

978
00:37:26,375 --> 00:37:29,041
(I really can't eat it) 

979
00:37:29,508 --> 00:37:31,041
- Is it tender? / - Very tender. 

980
00:37:31,041 --> 00:37:32,675
It smelled good. 

981
00:37:32,941 --> 00:37:35,775
You can't tell that it's rabbit. 

982
00:37:35,775 --> 00:37:37,008
Tasty? 

983
00:37:37,508 --> 00:37:39,741
- It's tasty. / - No rabbit. 

984
00:37:40,041 --> 00:37:41,175
Chicken. 

985
00:37:42,741 --> 00:37:43,575
(Chicken skewer, $2.20) 

986
00:37:43,575 --> 00:37:45,341
- Didn't you eat rabbit? / - Only Daeun had it. 

987
00:37:45,341 --> 00:37:46,375
Only I had it. 

988
00:37:46,375 --> 00:37:48,141
- Durian. / - How was it? 

989
00:37:48,141 --> 00:37:49,308
She said it was really delicious. 

990
00:37:49,308 --> 00:37:50,441
(They buy durian for dessert) 

991
00:37:51,175 --> 00:37:52,875
(How do they taste?) 

992
00:37:52,875 --> 00:37:54,608
(Battle Trip Part 2 will be aired soon) 

993
00:37:54,628 --> 00:37:55,728
Look at this. 

994
00:37:55,728 --> 00:37:57,394
This is all a floating market. 

995
00:38:01,594 --> 00:38:04,794
(Fried banana, $1.50) 

996
00:38:06,328 --> 00:38:08,261
I'm scared of rabbit. Chicken, please. 

997
00:38:08,261 --> 00:38:09,261
(Chicken skewer, $2.20) 

998
00:38:09,628 --> 00:38:11,161
Let me try durian. 

999
00:38:11,161 --> 00:38:13,328
(Lastly, they buy durian as their dessert) 

1000
00:38:14,161 --> 00:38:16,794
(They picked 4 types of simple snacks) 

1001
00:38:17,161 --> 00:38:19,594
- Let's sit and eat. / - I love eating at places like that. 

1002
00:38:20,028 --> 00:38:22,094
(They try the chicken skewer first) 

1003
00:38:22,494 --> 00:38:23,794
- Isn't it good? / - Yes. 

1004
00:38:23,794 --> 00:38:25,394
- It's the peanut sauce. / - The peanut sauce. 

1005
00:38:25,994 --> 00:38:27,828
Let's try the steamed buns too. 

1006
00:38:28,061 --> 00:38:30,928
Mine has milk filling inside. 

1007
00:38:31,761 --> 00:38:33,594
- You're so cruel! / - So cruel! 

1008
00:38:33,594 --> 00:38:34,928
Mine has strawberry filling inside. 

1009
00:38:35,094 --> 00:38:36,228
Strawberry. 

1010
00:38:36,228 --> 00:38:38,061
There are milk and strawberry flavors. 

1011
00:38:38,061 --> 00:38:40,528
- The colors are pretty inside. / - There's a variety. 

1012
00:38:42,661 --> 00:38:44,394
- The milk bun is... / - That looks good. 

1013
00:38:44,394 --> 00:38:46,094
- Did she say milk tea bun? / - That looks delicious. 

1014
00:38:46,094 --> 00:38:47,961
- I bet it's delicious. / - It's sweet and sour. 

1015
00:38:48,428 --> 00:38:51,061
People should buy what kids want too. 

1016
00:38:51,061 --> 00:38:53,294
- It's fun to eat cute buns. / - That's right. 

1017
00:38:53,994 --> 00:38:55,261
(Lastly, it's time to try the durian) 

1018
00:38:55,261 --> 00:38:56,394
- Durian! / - Grilled durian. 

1019
00:38:56,961 --> 00:38:58,361
And this is fresh durian. 

1020
00:38:59,094 --> 00:39:00,494
Fresh durian? 

1021
00:39:00,494 --> 00:39:01,828
That's a bit risky. 

1022
00:39:01,828 --> 00:39:03,928
They must brace themselves before eating. 

1023
00:39:03,928 --> 00:39:05,461
You've had this before. 

1024
00:39:05,461 --> 00:39:07,994
How was it when you tried durian for the first time? 

1025
00:39:08,561 --> 00:39:11,228
I liked it because it was sweeter than it smelled. 

1026
00:39:11,528 --> 00:39:13,228
Isn't it because of the sauce? 

1027
00:39:14,028 --> 00:39:15,228
Without the sauce. 

1028
00:39:16,594 --> 00:39:18,394
(She tries the grilled durian first without the sauce) 

1029
00:39:18,394 --> 00:39:19,561
That was my first time. 

1030
00:39:20,028 --> 00:39:22,761
People who love durian only eat that. 

1031
00:39:22,761 --> 00:39:24,761
(Ew) 

1032
00:39:24,961 --> 00:39:26,561
- At first... / - That was for real. 

1033
00:39:26,561 --> 00:39:28,628
- A real reaction. / - Can't handle it? 

1034
00:39:28,628 --> 00:39:31,294
No, it's better than I thought. 

1035
00:39:31,461 --> 00:39:33,328
Stop lying. 

1036
00:39:34,394 --> 00:39:35,561
(However, she can't keep a straight face) 

1037
00:39:35,561 --> 00:39:38,061
- Did you smell it? / - It smelled like fart just now. 

1038
00:39:38,061 --> 00:39:39,828
That's the smell of durian. 

1039
00:39:39,828 --> 00:39:42,261
- Jooe, have you had durian before? / - No. 

1040
00:39:42,261 --> 00:39:44,428
- I want to try that. / - My mouth smells like farts. 

1041
00:39:46,094 --> 00:39:47,928
- She's enjoying that. / - I want Yeonwoo to try it. 

1042
00:39:48,494 --> 00:39:49,994
- You said it smells like your feet. / - Yeonwoo... 

1043
00:39:52,328 --> 00:39:54,061
- Daeun. / - No. 

1044
00:39:56,061 --> 00:39:57,461
Daeun. 

1045
00:39:59,694 --> 00:40:01,328
Let me try the fresh durian. 

1046
00:40:02,094 --> 00:40:04,994
She put the ice on the bottom like it's shaved ice. 

1047
00:40:07,761 --> 00:40:09,928
(Suji enjoys it as expected) 

1048
00:40:10,261 --> 00:40:12,461
(That's delicious?) 

1049
00:40:12,994 --> 00:40:13,994
It's good. 

1050
00:40:13,994 --> 00:40:15,394
(They have two opposite feelings) 

1051
00:40:15,394 --> 00:40:17,294
I guess people eat this like shaved ice. 

1052
00:40:19,461 --> 00:40:21,061
If it's hard, don't eat it. 

1053
00:40:22,494 --> 00:40:24,128
But I'm curious about that. 

1054
00:40:24,328 --> 00:40:25,494
- It's good. / - Fresh durian. 

1055
00:40:25,794 --> 00:40:27,628
There's not much flesh left. 

1056
00:40:27,628 --> 00:40:29,061
Was the fresh durian okay? 

1057
00:40:29,928 --> 00:40:30,861
It's like mustard, right? 

1058
00:40:31,494 --> 00:40:34,194
- Did you like it? / - Look at her. She's so fun. 

1059
00:40:37,194 --> 00:40:39,061
Suji, this one is tastier. 

1060
00:40:39,061 --> 00:40:41,694
- This is better? / - The fresh durian was tastier. 

1061
00:40:41,694 --> 00:40:42,794
Grilled ones have a stronger smell. 

1062
00:40:42,794 --> 00:40:45,728
It smells bad at first but I can taste the sweetness. 

1063
00:40:45,861 --> 00:40:47,361
I felt it right away. 

1064
00:40:47,361 --> 00:40:48,694
- Right? / - I want to try it. 

1065
00:40:48,694 --> 00:40:49,828
I'll stop eating now. 

1066
00:40:50,428 --> 00:40:51,561
(You can have it all) 

1067
00:40:51,561 --> 00:40:52,894
You're not stopping because you don't like it, right? 

1068
00:40:52,894 --> 00:40:55,494
Remember when I said I've tried durian before. 

1069
00:40:55,494 --> 00:40:57,094
I said it was sweet and tasty. 

1070
00:40:57,094 --> 00:40:59,394
Turns out, that wasn't durian. 

1071
00:41:02,594 --> 00:41:06,828
(It was Suji's big picture of making her eat the durian) 

1072
00:41:08,028 --> 00:41:09,961
(She fooled me!) 

1073
00:41:10,528 --> 00:41:14,228
Viewers, brace yourself before eating durian. 

1074
00:41:17,561 --> 00:41:20,228
We still have the highlight of today's tour. 

1075
00:41:20,228 --> 00:41:22,661
I'll take you to the most popular spot. 

1076
00:41:22,961 --> 00:41:24,894
We're confident about this place. 

1077
00:41:24,894 --> 00:41:26,728
You must go here. 

1078
00:41:26,728 --> 00:41:28,194
- Is it a rooftop bar? / - Yes. 

1079
00:41:28,194 --> 00:41:29,328
- Rooftop? / - Seriously. 

1080
00:41:29,328 --> 00:41:31,661
- Look at that. / - What's happening? 

1081
00:41:32,361 --> 00:41:34,361
(It's a popular place on social media) 

1082
00:41:34,361 --> 00:41:35,494
In Indonesia... 

1083
00:41:35,494 --> 00:41:38,094
- A lot of people use social media. / - I see. 

1084
00:41:38,094 --> 00:41:40,161
That place was really popular. 

1085
00:41:41,694 --> 00:41:44,561
Daeun, don't let this surprise you. 

1086
00:41:45,061 --> 00:41:47,394
- Hello. / - This is very nice. 

1087
00:41:47,394 --> 00:41:49,194
What is this place? 

1088
00:41:49,194 --> 00:41:50,961
Look at this. Someone put a bus here. 

1089
00:41:50,961 --> 00:41:53,661
- There was a real bus at the bar. / - That's pretty. 

1090
00:41:53,661 --> 00:41:56,894
- It's mostly visited by young people. / - So nice. 

1091
00:41:56,894 --> 00:41:59,761
- Daeun, should we sit here? / - Take a seat. 

1092
00:42:00,194 --> 00:42:02,428
(Dancing) 

1093
00:42:05,961 --> 00:42:08,828
- We ought to look chic when we sit. / - Just like this? 

1094
00:42:08,828 --> 00:42:11,461
I thought that this would be the place you like. 

1095
00:42:11,461 --> 00:42:13,261
I have to visit popular places. 

1096
00:42:13,261 --> 00:42:14,794
I researched a lot online. 

1097
00:42:14,794 --> 00:42:15,994
(You're the best) 

1098
00:42:17,728 --> 00:42:19,628
This isn't a popular place in Korea. 

1099
00:42:19,628 --> 00:42:20,894
It's a popular place in Bandung. 

1100
00:42:21,628 --> 00:42:24,428
And they sell simple drinks here. 

1101
00:42:24,428 --> 00:42:25,894
- Are you hungry? / - Yes. 

1102
00:42:26,094 --> 00:42:27,328
- Are you hungry? / - Yes. 

1103
00:42:28,228 --> 00:42:30,628
You have my respect. Seriously, I respect you. 

1104
00:42:31,494 --> 00:42:33,694
- I shouldn't eat a lot at night. / - Right. 

1105
00:42:33,928 --> 00:42:36,494
- Let's get pizza. It's simple. / - Pizza? 

1106
00:42:36,494 --> 00:42:37,628
Excuse me. 

1107
00:42:38,428 --> 00:42:40,694
- One pizza costs... / - Cocktails. 

1108
00:42:40,694 --> 00:42:42,094
- $4.80. / - How much is it? 

1109
00:42:42,094 --> 00:42:44,061
- $4.80. / - So cheap? 

1110
00:42:44,061 --> 00:42:45,361
Here's what you must do here. 

1111
00:42:45,361 --> 00:42:47,094
Before they serve us our pizza, 

1112
00:42:47,094 --> 00:42:50,461
that bus is the symbol of this place. 

1113
00:42:50,461 --> 00:42:51,694
We must take photos there. 

1114
00:42:51,694 --> 00:42:53,894
- Others come here to take photos too. / - Yes. 

1115
00:42:53,894 --> 00:42:56,928
Suji, I prepared this for today. 

1116
00:42:56,928 --> 00:43:00,594
- Earlier, we made this. / - What's that? 

1117
00:43:02,828 --> 00:43:05,394
(After lunch, they made the toppers together) 

1118
00:43:06,928 --> 00:43:10,528
(Self-made toppers with paint markers and OHP films) 

1119
00:43:11,994 --> 00:43:14,528
(They can take photos just like this) 

1120
00:43:14,528 --> 00:43:15,694
I'm going to take it like this. 

1121
00:43:17,661 --> 00:43:21,194
(They take the best photos with handmade toppers) 

1122
00:43:23,294 --> 00:43:25,161
You look cute, Suji. 

1123
00:43:25,961 --> 00:43:27,561
That looks so cute. 

1124
00:43:28,628 --> 00:43:31,128
(SuDa Signal Tour in Bandung) 

1125
00:43:34,894 --> 00:43:36,128
Try to look cool. 

1126
00:43:36,994 --> 00:43:38,961
A popular place in Bandung. 

1127
00:43:38,961 --> 00:43:42,194
(Sexy at times, lovely at other times) 

1128
00:43:42,728 --> 00:43:45,394
(Photos for social media, lovely Daeun) 

1129
00:43:45,394 --> 00:43:47,594
- I'll hold this part of the bus. / - Okay. 

1130
00:43:47,594 --> 00:43:49,494
(Here's the real strong woman!) 

1131
00:43:50,728 --> 00:43:51,994
- She looks cute. / - Look at her! 

1132
00:43:51,994 --> 00:43:52,928
(Exerting superhuman power) 

1133
00:43:53,728 --> 00:43:54,528
It looks so real. 

1134
00:43:55,428 --> 00:43:56,794
(Taking photos while catching everyone's attention) 

1135
00:43:56,794 --> 00:43:58,728
The people in the back are taking photos of you. 

1136
00:43:59,528 --> 00:44:00,561
Okay. 

1137
00:44:01,428 --> 00:44:02,561
(A simple meal, pizza, is served) 

1138
00:44:02,561 --> 00:44:04,528
- The pizza was really good. / - So funny. 

1139
00:44:04,528 --> 00:44:05,594
- $4.80. / - It looks so good. 

1140
00:44:05,594 --> 00:44:07,328
That pizza is big too. 

1141
00:44:07,328 --> 00:44:10,128
- It was so good. / - So big for $4.80. 

1142
00:44:10,128 --> 00:44:11,461
- We ought to... / - Take this. 

1143
00:44:11,461 --> 00:44:12,928
That's right. We ought to eat pizza with our hands. 

1144
00:44:12,928 --> 00:44:14,261
We have to roll it too. 

1145
00:44:16,694 --> 00:44:18,294
Is that chicken? 

1146
00:44:18,294 --> 00:44:20,661
Daeun, are you really always hungry? 

1147
00:44:21,361 --> 00:44:22,594
When I see food... 

1148
00:44:22,594 --> 00:44:23,828
- I can't stop eating it. / - I see. 

1149
00:44:27,328 --> 00:44:29,594
- I love eating with my hands. / - Right. 

1150
00:44:29,594 --> 00:44:30,728
(She rolls it with one hand) 

1151
00:44:31,294 --> 00:44:33,128
(She takes a big bite) 

1152
00:44:33,128 --> 00:44:34,761
My gosh, she eats so well. 

1153
00:44:35,728 --> 00:44:36,928
It was to die for. 

1154
00:44:36,928 --> 00:44:38,694
You look like you're eating buckwheat crepe. 

1155
00:44:38,694 --> 00:44:40,894
It felt like I was too. 

1156
00:44:41,828 --> 00:44:42,828
Isn't it really good? 

1157
00:44:43,594 --> 00:44:46,194
I only taste the cheese, the dough... 

1158
00:44:46,194 --> 00:44:47,561
- And meat. / - I can only taste the meat. 

1159
00:44:47,561 --> 00:44:49,294
Do you like thick dough or thin dough? 

1160
00:44:49,294 --> 00:44:51,428
- I like thin dough. / - Me too. I like crunchy dough. 

1161
00:44:51,428 --> 00:44:52,994
I like it when it's like chips. 

1162
00:44:53,561 --> 00:44:55,228
If that's how you're going to eat, 

1163
00:44:55,228 --> 00:44:56,494
can I roll up this entire thing? 

1164
00:44:56,494 --> 00:44:58,661
(Roll up the entire thing?) 

1165
00:44:59,028 --> 00:45:00,061
Go ahead. 

1166
00:45:01,094 --> 00:45:02,194
She has my respect. 

1167

(Rolling two slices into one) 

1168
00:45:03,361 --> 00:45:06,594
She was rolling the slices like they were rice rolls. 

1169
00:45:08,228 --> 00:45:09,394
(I have to record this) 

1170
00:45:09,394 --> 00:45:10,561
This is how it looks. 

1171
00:45:10,828 --> 00:45:12,394
(Looking thick) 

1172
00:45:12,394 --> 00:45:14,028
- I like Daeun. / - It's as big as her face. 

1173
00:45:14,028 --> 00:45:15,094
She'll eat that? 

1174
00:45:15,561 --> 00:45:17,128
(This is thick enough for her to chew on) 

1175
00:45:17,128 --> 00:45:18,961
- She eats a lot. / - How is she so thin? 

1176
00:45:19,528 --> 00:45:20,661
Do you work out to eat? 

1177
00:45:20,661 --> 00:45:23,028
- Yes, I love eating. / - I can see. 

1178
00:45:23,528 --> 00:45:25,628
(Today's queen of eating show, Song Daeun) 

1179
00:45:25,628 --> 00:45:26,694
How was it, Daeun? 

1180
00:45:27,361 --> 00:45:30,694
We finished the first day of our trip. 

1181
00:45:30,694 --> 00:45:33,994
Give me a signal to tell me how good or bad it was. 

1182
00:45:34,494 --> 00:45:37,161
Everywhere we went was pretty. 

1183
00:45:37,161 --> 00:45:39,461
It was prettier because we were part of it. 

1184
00:45:39,961 --> 00:45:43,494
- Bandung has beautiful colors. / - It does. 

1185
00:45:43,494 --> 00:45:45,294
Actually, I love the weather. 

1186
00:45:46,728 --> 00:45:47,761
(She sends her evaluation in a text) 

1187
00:45:47,761 --> 00:45:49,894
Let me read this for you. 

1188

"Thank you for a day full of joy and excitement. 

1189
00:45:54,261 --> 00:45:57,728
Please look forward to tomorrow. Good night." 

1190
00:45:58,461 --> 00:46:00,428
I'm so grateful of your comment. 

1191
00:46:00,828 --> 00:46:02,928
You texted her when she was right in front of you? 

1192
00:46:02,928 --> 00:46:08,161
We parodied "Heart Signal," sending the text at night. 

1193
00:46:08,161 --> 00:46:10,761
I haven't exchanged texts in a while. 

1194
00:46:10,761 --> 00:46:12,928
- Do you like it? / - Yes, it brings back memories. 

1195
00:46:14,594 --> 00:46:15,661
In that show, 

1196
00:46:15,661 --> 00:46:17,661
we sent text messages to each other at night. 

1197
00:46:17,661 --> 00:46:21,561
Waiting for that message felt longer than a day. 

1198
00:46:21,561 --> 00:46:23,994
- Until the message arrives. / - I bet. 

1199
00:46:23,994 --> 00:46:26,894
On the show, I had to pretend that I got messages 

1200
00:46:26,894 --> 00:46:27,894
for the days I didn't get any. 

1201
00:46:27,894 --> 00:46:29,594
How did you pretend that? 

1202
00:46:29,594 --> 00:46:30,361
How did I pretend? 

1203
00:46:30,361 --> 00:46:34,328
I did my best to pretend but on TV, you could tell. 

1204
00:46:35,161 --> 00:46:37,194
- You pretended to get messages. / - Yes, I did. 

1205
00:46:37,994 --> 00:46:39,861
The caption said that they felt bad for me. 

1206
00:46:42,461 --> 00:46:45,394
Everyone, have fun in Bandung! 

1207
00:46:45,394 --> 00:46:47,794
- What a beautiful place. / - It was so pretty. 

1208
00:46:49,528 --> 00:46:51,228
The next day is Daeun's Day. 

1209
00:46:51,228 --> 00:46:52,594
- Daeun's Day. / - Daeun's Day. 

1210
00:46:52,594 --> 00:46:53,461
(If you like taking selfies, pay attention!) 

1211
00:46:54,528 --> 00:46:56,628
- Seriously. / - What are those houses? 

1212
00:46:59,028 --> 00:47:02,494
(Princess Daeun and Princess Suji will set out to find) 

1213
00:47:02,494 --> 00:47:05,894
(The best photo of their lives) 

1214
00:47:05,894 --> 00:47:08,428
We prepared the costumes. 

1215
00:47:09,161 --> 00:47:11,128
- I can't wait. / - What is that? 

1216
00:47:11,128 --> 00:47:12,361
Did they lend those costumes to you? 

1217
00:47:12,361 --> 00:47:13,128
Look at the monitor. 

1218
00:47:13,128 --> 00:47:15,328
Why are you turning away, Hwijae? 

1219
00:47:15,328 --> 00:47:17,928
No, I didn't turn away. I was glancing at it. 

1220
00:47:17,928 --> 00:47:22,328
The paradise for photos will be revealed. 

1221
00:47:22,328 --> 00:47:23,428
Everyone, remember this. 

1222
00:47:23,428 --> 00:47:25,094
- Look at the look on Suji's face. / - My gosh. 

1223
00:47:28,094 --> 00:47:29,294
(Screaming) 

1224
00:47:30,628 --> 00:47:32,928
Please don't do this! 

1225
00:47:34,261 --> 00:47:35,428
(Dizzying) 

1226
00:47:36,094 --> 00:47:37,328
Hold on. My goodness. 

1227
00:47:41,028 --> 00:47:42,694
This is just too scary. 

1228
00:47:42,694 --> 00:47:43,961
What is this? 

1229
00:47:43,961 --> 00:47:45,361
This is too scary. 

1230
00:47:45,361 --> 00:47:46,794
(What on earth happened to them?) 

1231
00:47:52,861 --> 00:47:55,394
(At least for today, they will be in the limelight) 

1232
00:47:56,228 --> 00:47:59,994
(It's the Mecca for selfies) 

1233
00:48:02,761 --> 00:48:07,628
(Day 2 of SuDa Signal Tour begins now) 

1234
00:48:11,328 --> 00:48:12,494
Where is this? hotel? 

1235
00:48:12,494 --> 00:48:13,961
Our second day has begun. 

1236
00:48:13,961 --> 00:48:16,261
- Yes, it's our hotel. / - Today is Daeun's Day. 

1237
00:48:16,261 --> 00:48:18,094
Yesterday, I had such a great time. 

1238
00:48:18,094 --> 00:48:19,994
I'm very looking forward to today as well. 

1239
00:48:19,994 --> 00:48:20,728
You won't be disappointed. 

1240
00:48:20,728 --> 00:48:23,961
As I told you in the beginning, 

1241
00:48:23,961 --> 00:48:27,328
this tour will start and end with awesome photos. 

1242
00:48:27,328 --> 00:48:29,894
- I said I'd plan a tour like that. / - Right. 

1243
00:48:29,894 --> 00:48:32,428
- There's one more thing I prepared. / - What is it? 

1244
00:48:33,094 --> 00:48:36,528
Surprise! I prepared a rental car. 

1245
00:48:36,528 --> 00:48:39,161
(1 day rent including the driver, $56.50) 

1246
00:48:40,828 --> 00:48:42,261
- Is the driver's seat on the right? / - Isn't it expensive? 

1247
00:48:42,261 --> 00:48:44,361
Yes, the driver's seat is on the opposite side. 

1248
00:48:44,361 --> 00:48:47,428
They don't have international licenses here. 

1249
00:48:47,428 --> 00:48:50,094
Since we can't drive here, 

1250
00:48:50,094 --> 00:48:53,194
I rented a car and a driver as well. 

1251
00:48:53,594 --> 00:48:55,061
You must have spent quite some money. 

1252
00:48:55,061 --> 00:48:56,694
That car looks expensive. 

1253
00:48:56,694 --> 00:49:00,728
It's cheaper to rent a car than to ride around in a taxi. 

1254
00:49:00,728 --> 00:49:02,961
- Driver included. / - It's included and still cheaper? 

1255
00:49:02,961 --> 00:49:05,228
- Yes, it's cheaper than a taxi. / - All day? 

1256
00:49:05,228 --> 00:49:07,028
And if you get stuck in traffic, 

1257
00:49:07,028 --> 00:49:09,294
the meter continues to go up. 

1258
00:49:09,294 --> 00:49:11,628
But if you use a rental car, that's no concern. 

1259
00:49:11,628 --> 00:49:14,228
- Would you ride the car with me? / - I will. Good job. 

1260
00:49:14,228 --> 00:49:16,828
- Okay. / - Let's go take pictures. 

1261
00:49:17,528 --> 00:49:19,428
- Hello. / - Hi. 

1262
00:49:19,428 --> 00:49:21,394
- How are you? / - Hi. 

1263
00:49:21,394 --> 00:49:24,128
He'll be driving for us the whole day. 

1264
00:49:24,128 --> 00:49:26,461
- He'll drive us around. / - Thank you very much. 

1265
00:49:31,228 --> 00:49:32,428
(Bandung Tour, Daeun's Day) 

1266
00:49:32,428 --> 00:49:35,728
(The sacred place of selfies, selfie park) 

1267
00:49:37,328 --> 00:49:39,794
(The selfie tour starts!) 

1268
00:49:40,228 --> 00:49:42,728
- I'm getting used to this. / - What a relief. 

1269
00:49:42,728 --> 00:49:45,928
(Hotel to the park takes about 35 minutes by car) 

1270
00:49:45,928 --> 00:49:47,194
- Daeun. / - Yes? 

1271
00:49:47,194 --> 00:49:48,828
Since you've been talking so much 

1272
00:49:48,828 --> 00:49:50,494
about taking pictures, 

1273
00:49:50,494 --> 00:49:53,261
I prepared something today. 

1274
00:49:53,728 --> 00:49:55,994
When we take pictures, 

1275
00:49:55,994 --> 00:49:58,328
it's important to have pretty faces. 

1276
00:49:59,194 --> 00:50:00,394
But also... 

1277
00:50:00,894 --> 00:50:02,928
- Our outfits are important too. The concept. / - True. 

1278
00:50:02,928 --> 00:50:04,894
I think the concept is the most important thing. 

1279
00:50:04,894 --> 00:50:08,161
- So I borrowed some costumes... / - Yes. 

1280
00:50:08,161 --> 00:50:11,428
From the "Gag Concert" waiting room. 

1281
00:50:11,428 --> 00:50:13,228
The "Gag Concert" waiting room? 

1282
00:50:13,228 --> 00:50:15,261
You went into the wardrobe and brought them? 

1283
00:50:15,261 --> 00:50:17,894
Yes, I carefully picked them. 

1284
00:50:18,861 --> 00:50:21,861
Are there normal costumes in that wardrobe? 

1285
00:50:21,861 --> 00:50:25,394
There are many pretty costumes. Goodness. 

1286
00:50:25,694 --> 00:50:28,428
This is what I was talking about. 

1287
00:50:28,428 --> 00:50:31,394
- They're not that pretty, are they? / - She looks cute. 

1288
00:50:31,394 --> 00:50:33,261
- I got nervous. / - But that wardrobe... 

1289
00:50:33,261 --> 00:50:35,828
- Has all kinds of costumes. / - I couldn't hide it. 

1290
00:50:35,828 --> 00:50:36,761
- Let's put on the costumes. / - Yes. 

1291
00:50:36,761 --> 00:50:40,461
I can't tell you what costumes they are yet. 

1292
00:50:40,461 --> 00:50:41,661
I'm sure you'll be satisfied. 

1293
00:50:41,661 --> 00:50:43,628
- Alright. / - You'll be satisfied. 

1294
00:50:43,928 --> 00:50:45,294
- I'll be looking forward to it. / - Okay. 

1295
00:50:45,628 --> 00:50:49,028
Let's take great pictures in the costumes. 

1296
00:50:49,328 --> 00:50:50,694
I wanted to make the best out of it. 

1297
00:50:50,694 --> 00:50:52,394
I brought costumes for the photos. 

1298
00:50:52,394 --> 00:50:55,394
You should have taken the wigs too. 

1299
00:50:55,394 --> 00:50:56,294
If you go to Disneyland, 

1300
00:50:56,294 --> 00:50:58,161
you'll find people in costumes everywhere. 

1301
00:50:58,161 --> 00:50:58,494
That's true. 

1302
00:50:58,494 --> 00:51:00,894
- I mean it. All Elsa. / - They'd be a thousand Elsas. 

1303
00:51:00,894 --> 00:51:03,128
- Elsa from "Frozen." / - There are 10,000 Elsas. 

1304
00:51:04,528 --> 00:51:08,594
(Selfie park is popular among the youth) 

1305
00:51:10,094 --> 00:51:12,328
People call this place as selfie park. 

1306
00:51:12,328 --> 00:51:14,428
It's a great place to take awesome selfies. 

1307
00:51:14,428 --> 00:51:15,994
It looks safe. 

1308
00:51:15,994 --> 00:51:17,261
(It's a paradise for selfie lovers) 

1309
00:51:18,294 --> 00:51:19,394
How cute. 

1310
00:51:19,861 --> 00:51:21,261
It looks fun. 

1311
00:51:21,261 --> 00:51:24,061
(Open from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m., tickets cost $1.50) 

1312
00:51:24,061 --> 00:51:25,594
Even children do it. 

1313
00:51:25,594 --> 00:51:26,794
- Yeah. / - It's safe. 

1314
00:51:27,594 --> 00:51:29,494
The entrance fee is very cheap as well. 

1315
00:51:29,494 --> 00:51:31,261
- $1.50. / - It's only $1.50. 

1316
00:51:31,261 --> 00:51:32,694
The entrance fee is $1.50? 

1317

(Under the sunshine, princesses walk in) 

1318
00:51:35,361 --> 00:51:36,961
Do you like it? 

1319
00:51:36,961 --> 00:51:38,861
I'm very pleased.

He looks so surprised. 

1323

They're shocked. 

1324
00:51:47,194 --> 00:51:48,261
You look great in it. 

1325
00:51:49,694 --> 00:51:51,028
You can't wear such costumes... 

1326
00:51:51,028 --> 00:51:52,761
- When it's too hot. / - You're right.

1329
00:52:02,361 --> 00:52:03,861
It's so fresh. 

1330
00:52:04,294 --> 00:52:07,628
- Even the weather is... / - It's blissful. 

1331
00:52:07,794 --> 00:52:09,728
I feel like at the end of this road, 

1332
00:52:09,728 --> 00:52:11,694
there will be seven dwarves. 

1333
00:52:11,694 --> 00:52:13,294
And you'll meet the Beast. 

1334
00:52:16,628 --> 00:52:17,694
The air is so fresh here as well. 

1335
00:52:18,161 --> 00:52:23,061
I feel like I'm in a theme park in Korea. 

1336
00:52:23,061 --> 00:52:25,594
The wind is so refreshing. 

1337
00:52:25,594 --> 00:52:29,861
There are a lot of places where we can take pictures. 

1338
00:52:29,861 --> 00:52:31,194
Is the dress made of velvet? 

1339
00:52:31,194 --> 00:52:32,761
- Yes. / - It must have been so hot. 

1340
00:52:32,761 --> 00:52:34,394
- Weren't you hot? / - It wasn't hot that day. 

1341
00:52:34,394 --> 00:52:36,061
- Weren't you hot? / - I was really okay. 

1342
00:52:36,061 --> 00:52:37,494
- It looks hot. / - The weather was... 

1343
00:52:37,494 --> 00:52:39,861
- Worth it if you get a good shot. / - There is a reason... 

1344
00:52:39,861 --> 00:52:42,061
Why this is called a selfie park. 

1345
00:52:42,061 --> 00:52:43,228
I can see why. 

1346
00:52:43,228 --> 00:52:45,161
Isn't this place pretty? 

1347
00:52:45,161 --> 00:52:47,228
I know. 

1348

(Giggling) 

1351
00:52:55,561 --> 00:52:58,461
That yellow looks like it's dyed with gardenia seeds. 

1352
00:52:58,461 --> 00:52:59,361
I see what you mean. 

1353
00:52:59,361 --> 00:53:01,628
- It's a very bright yellow. / - Exactly. 

1354
00:53:01,628 --> 00:53:03,961
Clothes in bright colors make 

1355
00:53:03,961 --> 00:53:05,094
better and prettier photos. 

1356
00:53:05,094 --> 00:53:06,994
You even considered that. 

1357

There are so many places we can go. 

1358
00:53:09,028 --> 00:53:10,661
- I know. / - I'm not sure where to start. 

1359
00:53:10,661 --> 00:53:13,094
Princess Daeun, could you sit over here? 

1360
00:53:13,528 --> 00:53:14,961
- Here? / - Yes.

(Let me take a nice picture of you) 

1362
00:53:19,528 --> 00:53:22,528
Our Belle is so pretty. 

1363

(Is this a fairytale? She's so pretty) 

1364
00:53:24,694 --> 00:53:26,728
You look so pretty. 

1365
00:53:26,728 --> 00:53:29,228

- We made something like that. / - We did. 

1381
00:54:19,628 --> 00:54:22,328
It seems like many Indonesians use social media. 

1382
00:54:22,328 --> 00:54:24,161
Because of the big population, 

1383
00:54:24,161 --> 00:54:26,861
I heard many Indonesians use social media.

Hold on a second. Flying in the sky? 

1395
00:55:00,061 --> 00:55:01,394
I hate climbing up somewhere high 

1396

How is that possible? 

1401

How does that work? 

1402
00:55:14,561 --> 00:55:16,728

I can't ride this. This will make me feel bad.

01:00:43,694 --> 01:00:46,061
There are separate bungalows. 

1538
01:00:46,561 --> 01:00:47,461
I can hear the valley. 

1539
01:00:47,461 --> 01:00:49,061
I can hear the sound of running water. 

1540
01:00:49,061 --> 01:00:50,494
My goodness. 

1541
01:00:50,494 --> 01:00:53,294
The stream is flowing down the rocks. 

1542
01:00:53,294 --> 01:00:54,361
(A small stream is flowing in Kampung Daun) 

1543
01:00:54,361 --> 01:00:57,361
Look at the stream over there. 

1544
01:00:57,361 --> 01:00:59,661
We should practice singing here. 

1545
01:00:59,961 --> 01:01:02,294
Our seats are over there. 

1546
01:01:02,928 --> 01:01:04,961
- Over there? / - Where we can see the stream. 

1547
01:01:04,961 --> 01:01:08,361
- It looks like a resort, but it's a restaurant? / - Yes. 

1548
01:01:08,361 --> 01:01:11,161
You can borrow the whole bungalow 

1549
01:01:11,161 --> 01:01:12,861
and have a private meal in there. 

1550
01:01:12,861 --> 01:01:14,294
- That sounds nice. / - It is cool. 

1551
01:01:14,294 --> 01:01:15,394
It is amazing. 

1552
01:01:15,861 --> 01:01:17,861
It'll be good if you go there with your parents. 

1553
01:01:17,861 --> 01:01:19,728
(The place is crowded with tourists on weekends) 

1554
01:01:19,728 --> 01:01:22,161
(You can choose the room through a reservation) 

1555
01:01:22,861 --> 01:01:24,994
This is so cool. 

1556
01:01:25,694 --> 01:01:27,994
I was so hungry. 

1557
01:01:28,461 --> 01:01:30,461
They have a lot of dishes on the menu. 

1558
01:01:30,461 --> 01:01:31,761
Where's the bell? 

1559
01:01:31,761 --> 01:01:34,994
They have their own special way to take an order. 

1560
01:01:34,994 --> 01:01:36,461
It's right there. 

1561
01:01:36,461 --> 01:01:38,394
- It's the tube. / - You blow in it? 

1562
01:01:39,361 --> 01:01:41,461
- What is it? / - It's a wood tube. 

1563
01:01:41,461 --> 01:01:42,661
When you place an order... 

1564
01:01:43,128 --> 01:01:45,261
(You bang the wooden tube to call the waiter) 

1565
01:01:45,261 --> 01:01:46,561
That's new. 

1566
01:01:46,561 --> 01:01:48,628
- Instead of ringing a bell? / - Right. 

1567
01:01:49,694 --> 01:01:51,128
I should hit it four times. 

1568
01:01:51,194 --> 01:01:53,128
"I'm hungry." Like this. 

1569
01:01:53,128 --> 01:01:55,761
(Princess Suji is calling us, let's hurry) 

1570
01:01:57,394 --> 01:02:00,761
(The food is being served) 

1571
01:02:00,761 --> 01:02:02,728
I think it's nasi goreng. 

1572
01:02:02,794 --> 01:02:06,228
(The best dish, nasi goreng, looks and tastes good) 

1573
01:02:07,328 --> 01:02:09,661
(Nasi goreng set, $4.10) 

1574
01:02:09,661 --> 01:02:10,728
It looks delicious. 

1575
01:02:10,728 --> 01:02:11,861
- It must be good. / - It was so good. 

1576
01:02:11,861 --> 01:02:13,028
- I told you. / - Was it good? 

1577
01:02:13,028 --> 01:02:14,361
The food must be good there. 

1578
01:02:14,361 --> 01:02:15,861
It looks so cute. 

1579
01:02:15,861 --> 01:02:19,761
This is exactly what I saw on the internet. 

1580
01:02:19,761 --> 01:02:23,061
Let's taste nasi goreng first then. 

1581
01:02:23,061 --> 01:02:24,228
I hope it's not spicy. 

1582
01:02:24,228 --> 01:02:26,828
What would nasi goreng of Kampung Daun taste like? 

1583
01:02:26,828 --> 01:02:30,328
(How does nasi goreng taste in Kampung Daun?) 

1584
01:02:38,761 --> 01:02:40,961
It feels like eating rice with sea. 

1585
01:02:41,294 --> 01:02:42,694
It tastes like the sea. 

1586
01:02:42,961 --> 01:02:44,528
It tastes different from what we had yesterday. 

1587
01:02:44,528 --> 01:02:46,428
- It must be good. / - It was great. 

1588
01:02:46,428 --> 01:02:49,661
- I love it. / - It tastes like seafood fried rice. 

1589
01:02:49,661 --> 01:02:50,761
You can really taste the shrimp. 

1590
01:02:50,761 --> 01:02:53,228
- It's very rich. / - Yeah. 

1591
01:02:55,528 --> 01:02:57,928
I think this place can be... 

1592
01:02:58,794 --> 01:03:01,361
Enjoyed by people of all ages. 

1593
01:03:01,361 --> 01:03:03,961
Anyone can enjoy the food with no problem. 

1594
01:03:03,961 --> 01:03:04,594
Exactly. 

1595
01:03:05,261 --> 01:03:06,261
It's here. 

1596
01:03:06,261 --> 01:03:08,461
(What's the second menu?) 

1597
01:03:08,461 --> 01:03:09,628
(Rib soup, $7.30) 

1598
01:03:09,628 --> 01:03:10,828
It's rib soup. 

1599
01:03:13,094 --> 01:03:15,761
Let's taste the soup first. 

1600
01:03:15,761 --> 01:03:16,861
Okay. 

1601
01:03:17,261 --> 01:03:18,461
It must be delicious. 

1602
01:03:18,461 --> 01:03:20,628
- It looks just like rib soup. / - Yeah. 

1603
01:03:28,028 --> 01:03:29,161
Isn't it Korean food? 

1604
01:03:29,161 --> 01:03:31,528
- It feels like we're in Korea. / - Are we in Korea? 

1605
01:03:31,528 --> 01:03:34,394
It tastes like Korean rib soup with a little fat. 

1606
01:03:34,394 --> 01:03:36,828
It is a little greasy, and it has some spices in it. 

1607
01:03:36,828 --> 01:03:38,594
Just a little. 

1608
01:03:38,961 --> 01:03:41,494
But it is not too strong. 

1609
01:03:41,494 --> 01:03:44,761
It doesn't ruin the taste of the soup. 

1610
01:03:44,761 --> 01:03:46,828
- Exactly. / - It works well. 

1611
01:03:47,028 --> 01:03:48,594
It tastes like Korean food. 

1612
01:03:48,594 --> 01:03:49,728
It's so good. What should I do? 

1613
01:03:49,728 --> 01:03:52,194
Beef is expensive in Korea. 

1614
01:03:52,194 --> 01:03:54,228
You should eat a lot of beef when you go there. 

1615
01:03:54,228 --> 01:03:55,394
- It's cheap. / - Right. 

1616
01:03:55,894 --> 01:03:57,594
- And it tastes good. / - Exactly. 

1617
01:03:57,594 --> 01:03:58,828
That's a good idea. 

1618
01:03:58,828 --> 01:04:00,228
Do you want to put rice in it? 

1619
01:04:00,228 --> 01:04:01,494
Get it, get it. 

1620
01:04:01,494 --> 01:04:03,061
- I'll put all of it in. / - Let's put it in. 

1621
01:04:03,061 --> 01:04:06,861
It's a magic act where rice disappears. 

1622
01:04:11,394 --> 01:04:13,828
(It's the perfect combination) 

1623
01:04:13,828 --> 01:04:14,961
This is it. 

1624
01:04:16,261 --> 01:04:16,861
This is it. 

1625
01:04:17,528 --> 01:04:20,161
It tastes like short rib soup 

1626
01:04:20,161 --> 01:04:21,561
you eat after a long day of work. 

1627
01:04:21,561 --> 01:04:23,761
(It relieves the fatigue from the day's work) 

1628
01:04:25,294 --> 01:04:27,994
- It tastes better with rice. / - Gosh. 

1629
01:04:27,994 --> 01:04:29,928
- It looks amazing. / - The rib soup. 

1630
01:04:31,228 --> 01:04:33,161
And I want to try the shrimp. 

1631
01:04:33,161 --> 01:04:35,094
(What's the last menu?) 

1632
01:04:35,094 --> 01:04:36,928
That tastes like kimchi. 

1633
01:04:37,528 --> 01:04:39,461
- Shrimps. / - It's barbecued. 

1634
01:04:39,928 --> 01:04:41,628
- Shrimps. / - It looks well-grilled. 

1635
01:04:41,628 --> 01:04:43,228
It's only $6.50. 

1636
01:04:43,228 --> 01:04:45,161
- My goodness. / - It's so cheap. 

1637
01:04:45,161 --> 01:04:47,061
(Daeun is removing skewers to eat the shrimp) 

1638
01:04:47,061 --> 01:04:49,394
Daeun, can I have it on the skewer? 

1639
01:04:50,061 --> 01:04:52,428
(I should eat the whole shrimp) 

1640
01:04:52,428 --> 01:04:53,461
This is it. 

1641
01:04:53,461 --> 01:04:55,728
- It looks so good. / - I guess they grilled the shrimp. 

1642
01:04:55,728 --> 01:04:57,661
(What does the grilled shrimp taste like?) 

1643
01:05:00,761 --> 01:05:01,894
How is it? 

1644
01:05:01,894 --> 01:05:03,494
(How is it?) 

1645
01:05:03,494 --> 01:05:04,728
Is it good? 

1646
01:05:05,828 --> 01:05:06,961
Is it delicious? 

1647
01:05:06,961 --> 01:05:09,228
(It's the best) 

1648
01:05:09,828 --> 01:05:12,128
(I can't wait any longer, I have to eat it) 

1649
01:05:12,128 --> 01:05:13,428
It's well-grilled. 

1650
01:05:13,861 --> 01:05:15,061
It was really good. 

1651
01:05:15,061 --> 01:05:16,894
We ate the whole shrimp without peeling it. 

1652
01:05:17,361 --> 01:05:18,661
It tastes like Korean food, right? 

1653
01:05:18,661 --> 01:05:20,928
They grilled the shrimp without peeling it. 

1654
01:05:21,661 --> 01:05:23,894
But it's very tender. 

1655
01:05:23,894 --> 01:05:24,861
I love it. 

1656
01:05:24,861 --> 01:05:28,028
And the sauce is sweet and salty. It's so good. 

1657
01:05:28,028 --> 01:05:29,394
It's sweet and salty. 

1658
01:05:29,394 --> 01:05:31,794
I don't like to eat the shrimp shell. 

1659
01:05:31,794 --> 01:05:33,061
But after grilling it like this... 

1660
01:05:33,728 --> 01:05:35,861
It's tender and crispy. Here we go. 

1661
01:05:37,261 --> 01:05:38,394
(Taking a big bite) 

1662
01:05:38,394 --> 01:05:40,028
She's eating two at once. 

1663
01:05:40,028 --> 01:05:41,394
It was so good. 

1664
01:05:41,394 --> 01:05:43,528
- The shell was soft as well. / - It's so good. 

1665
01:05:43,528 --> 01:05:44,494
It was so good. 

1666
01:05:44,494 --> 01:05:47,128
It's not tough at all. It's thin and crispy. 

1667
01:05:47,128 --> 01:05:49,028
It has a nice, crunchy texture. 

1668
01:05:49,028 --> 01:05:51,194
- It was the best dish. / - Right. 

1669
01:05:51,194 --> 01:05:52,494
It was the best of the best. 

1670
01:05:53,028 --> 01:05:54,394
This is the best, right? 

1671
01:05:55,128 --> 01:05:57,328
There's seasoned vegetable. 

1672
01:05:57,328 --> 01:05:58,794
- It looks like kimchi. / - Right. 

1673
01:05:58,794 --> 01:06:01,494
It looks like mustard leaf kimchi. 

1674
01:06:04,728 --> 01:06:05,794
(This is just like kimchi) 

1675
01:06:05,794 --> 01:06:07,061
It tastes like kimchi. 

1676
01:06:07,061 --> 01:06:08,894
- Is it kimchi? / - Is it refreshing? 

1677
01:06:08,894 --> 01:06:11,294
- That's interesting. / - Yes, it tastes like kimchi. 

1678
01:06:11,694 --> 01:06:14,128
Place a kimchi leaf on my spoon of rib soup. 

1679
01:06:14,128 --> 01:06:17,161
Am I in Indonesia or Korea? 

1680
01:06:18,528 --> 01:06:22,661
(The perfect combination that can't fail) 

1681
01:06:24,294 --> 01:06:24,928
It's delicious? 

1682
01:06:25,828 --> 01:06:27,528
This is excellent. 

1683
01:06:27,961 --> 01:06:28,828
It works well. 

1684
01:06:28,828 --> 01:06:30,394
When I had this rib soup, 

1685
01:06:30,394 --> 01:06:31,394
I wanted to eat some kimchi. 

1686
01:06:31,394 --> 01:06:33,261
It tastes so good with rib soup. 

1687
01:06:33,261 --> 01:06:35,628
It was the perfect harmony. 

1688
01:06:35,628 --> 01:06:38,794
I was worried about the food of Southeast Asia. 

1689
01:06:38,794 --> 01:06:42,861
Even people like me can enjoy these dishes. 

1690
01:06:42,861 --> 01:06:44,528
- Right. / - They all are good. 

1691
01:06:44,528 --> 01:06:46,094
It is well seasoned. 

1692
01:06:46,094 --> 01:06:48,828
It's not too salty either. 

1693
01:06:48,828 --> 01:06:50,794
I think it's suits the Korean palate well. 

1694
01:06:50,794 --> 01:06:52,794
It's so cost effective. 

1695
01:06:53,028 --> 01:06:56,628
Whatever you order, the price is very cheap. 

1696
01:06:56,628 --> 01:06:57,994
You can enjoy the trip without worrying about money. 

1697
01:06:57,994 --> 01:06:59,394
There aren't many dishes that cost more than $10. 

1698
01:06:59,394 --> 01:07:00,761
- That's right. / - Okay. 

1699
01:07:01,161 --> 01:07:02,961
What do you think? Did you enjoy the food? 

1700
01:07:02,961 --> 01:07:05,294
Now that we had a meal... 

1701
01:07:05,594 --> 01:07:07,328
And enjoyed the beautiful view. 

1702
01:07:07,328 --> 01:07:09,461
- Tell me what we haven't tried. / - Coffee. 

1703
01:07:09,461 --> 01:07:11,694
We haven't had coffee yet today. 

1704
01:07:11,694 --> 01:07:12,594
(Time for coffee?) 

1705
01:07:12,594 --> 01:07:13,861
Is it time for dessert? 

1706
01:07:13,861 --> 01:07:14,828
(Bingo) 

1707
01:07:14,828 --> 01:07:15,761
I love you. 

1708
01:07:15,761 --> 01:07:18,728
- We haven't had bread since arriving here. / - Yeah. 

1709
01:07:18,728 --> 01:07:20,628
It will complete our trip. 

1710
01:07:20,628 --> 01:07:21,694
(Let's go to complete our trip) 

1711
01:07:21,694 --> 01:07:22,961
Let's go, go. 

1712
01:07:26,961 --> 01:07:28,028
(Bandung Tour, Daeun's Day) 

1713
01:07:28,028 --> 01:07:31,094
(Bakery cafe for the best photos) 

1714
01:07:31,094 --> 01:07:35,294
(Kampung Daun to bakery cafe, 40 minutes by car) 

1715
01:07:45,261 --> 01:07:46,794
Ta-da! 

1716
01:07:46,794 --> 01:07:48,561
Are they having a festival or what? 

1717
01:07:48,561 --> 01:07:49,794
It's beautiful, isn't it? 

1718
01:07:49,794 --> 01:07:51,761
- It's beautiful. / - It's chilly at night. 

1719
01:07:51,761 --> 01:07:52,561
(Look at the beautiful lights) 

1720
01:07:52,994 --> 01:07:56,461
If you wear a jacket, it's a bit cool at night. 

1721
01:07:56,461 --> 01:07:57,461
(This is the hottest place in Bandung) 

1722
01:07:57,694 --> 01:07:58,694
- So many people. / - It's pretty. 

1723
01:07:58,694 --> 01:08:00,294
There were a lot of people. 

1724
01:08:00,294 --> 01:08:02,294
It's a good place for a date. 

1725
01:08:02,294 --> 01:08:04,894
- There were a lot of lovers. / - There were. 

1726
01:08:05,828 --> 01:08:07,694
It's so affordable that it's worth going there. 

1727
01:08:07,694 --> 01:08:09,728
Where does the cafe start and where does it end? 

1728
01:08:09,728 --> 01:08:10,728
- All of that is the cafe. / - All of it. 

1729
01:08:10,728 --> 01:08:12,861
- All of it? / - Yes, that entire area. 

1730
01:08:12,861 --> 01:08:13,761
(Open 9 a.m. to 9 p.m., admission fee, 70 cents) 

1731
01:08:13,761 --> 01:08:15,128
- It's a cafe street. / - It's really big. 

1732
01:08:15,128 --> 01:08:17,794
- Is there an admission fee? / - It's really expensive. 

1733
01:08:17,794 --> 01:08:19,261
- It's 70 cents. / - Yes. 

1734
01:08:19,261 --> 01:08:21,228
- It's 70 cents. / - 70 cents. 

1735
01:08:26,261 --> 01:08:28,628
Every spot was a great photo spot. 

1736
01:08:29,128 --> 01:08:30,528
So pretty. 

1737
01:08:30,528 --> 01:08:33,061
2, 3. 2, 3. 

1738
01:08:33,061 --> 01:08:34,128
(You can't leave us out when it comes to photos) 

1739
01:08:34,128 --> 01:08:35,661
It's so cute. 

1740
01:08:36,394 --> 01:08:38,761
All they did was take photos. 

1741
01:08:38,761 --> 01:08:39,494
(Can you guess which is the flower?) 

1742
01:08:39,494 --> 01:08:41,994
- They say only photos will remain. / - That's right. 

1743
01:08:41,994 --> 01:08:44,361
- That castle is also in the cafe. / - That's also in the cafe? 

1744
01:08:44,361 --> 01:08:45,428
- Yes. / - Wow. 

1745
01:08:45,428 --> 01:08:49,361
(Daeun's Day ends at a beautiful castle) 

1746
01:08:49,361 --> 01:08:52,694
This atmosphere feels like a movie. 

1747
01:08:52,694 --> 01:08:55,361
- It's really like "Harry Potter." / - It really is. 

1748
01:08:55,361 --> 01:08:58,228
- Men really like that movie. / - That's right. 

1749
01:08:58,228 --> 01:09:01,128
I think that men and women of all ages 

1750
01:09:01,128 --> 01:09:02,994
would enjoy this place. 

1751
01:09:02,994 --> 01:09:04,661
Right. I say this with utmost confidence 

1752
01:09:04,661 --> 01:09:06,861
that this place is worth recommending to everyone 

1753
01:09:06,861 --> 01:09:08,194
including family, lovers and friends. 

1754
01:09:08,194 --> 01:09:09,228
I'm serious. 

1755
01:09:09,228 --> 01:09:11,894
I think it was such a perfect day. 

1756
01:09:11,894 --> 01:09:14,661
Really? Are you satisfied? 

1757
01:09:14,728 --> 01:09:17,594
I'm satisfied but the bread isn't here yet. 

1758
01:09:17,594 --> 01:09:19,194
Making me disappointed. 

1759
01:09:20,694 --> 01:09:24,394
Wait a minute, Princess Daeun. 

1760
01:09:24,394 --> 01:09:25,461
- Banana split. / - What is this? 

1761
01:09:25,461 --> 01:09:27,794
- Banana split? / - Banana split. 

1762
01:09:27,794 --> 01:09:28,861
Brownie with ice cream. 

1763
01:09:28,861 --> 01:09:31,594
It's a brownie. 

1764
01:09:32,094 --> 01:09:38,128
(Two desserts to capture the hearts of women) 

1765
01:09:39,028 --> 01:09:43,261
(They are pretty desserts that are perfect for photos) 

1766
01:09:43,261 --> 01:09:46,294
- This banana ice cream was good. / - What is this? 

1767
01:09:46,294 --> 01:09:48,528
- Brownies and banana split. / - Banana split. 

1768
01:09:48,528 --> 01:09:49,928
- Banana split? / - That looks a little expensive. 

1769
01:09:49,928 --> 01:09:51,861
- It's only $2.40. / - What? 

1770
01:09:51,861 --> 01:09:53,428
- Isn't it really cheap? / - That's impossible. 

1771
01:09:53,428 --> 01:09:55,161
- All of that? / - I want to live in Indonesia. 

1772
01:09:55,161 --> 01:09:56,461
I also want to immigrate. 

1773
01:09:56,461 --> 01:09:58,294
Men and women are different. 

1774
01:09:58,294 --> 01:10:01,261
Honestly, there aren't a lot of situations 

1775
01:10:01,261 --> 01:10:03,761
where men get excited about desserts. 

1776
01:10:03,761 --> 01:10:05,528
To be exact, 

1777
01:10:05,528 --> 01:10:07,994
it's hard to understand why they're drinking coffee 

1778
01:10:07,994 --> 01:10:09,094
when the sun is already set. 

1779
01:10:09,094 --> 01:10:10,994
I can't believe this! 

1780
01:10:11,828 --> 01:10:13,694
- It looks really good. / - It looks good. 

1781
01:10:14,794 --> 01:10:16,528
- Should we try them? / - Should we? 

1782
01:10:22,128 --> 01:10:22,694
Cheers. 

1783
01:10:22,694 --> 01:10:25,594
(How does the brownie and ice cream combo taste?) 

1784
01:10:27,228 --> 01:10:30,361
(She is lost for words) 

1785
01:10:34,228 --> 01:10:36,528
(Bliss) 

1786
01:10:36,528 --> 01:10:38,828
- It's like a commercial. / - Was it good? 

1787
01:10:38,828 --> 01:10:40,528
Yeonwoo has been won over. 

1788
01:10:40,528 --> 01:10:42,828
- We've got you. / - It went so well with coffee. 

1789
01:10:43,428 --> 01:10:45,361
Let's be honest. MOMOLAND likes this, right? 

1790
01:10:45,894 --> 01:10:46,694
Right? 

1791
01:10:48,194 --> 01:10:50,161
The brownie is so moist 

1792
01:10:50,161 --> 01:10:51,261
inside the mouth. 

1793
01:10:52,561 --> 01:10:55,861
You could say that we drank coffee to eat desserts. 

1794
01:10:55,861 --> 01:10:59,994
There's thick chocolate inside the brownie. 

1795
01:11:02,194 --> 01:11:05,028
(Another bite) 

1796
01:11:07,028 --> 01:11:10,094
(The next dessert they will taste is the banana split) 

1797
01:11:11,594 --> 01:11:14,761
(They are tasting it) 

1798
01:11:15,594 --> 01:11:17,694
- It's good. / - It's really good. 

1799
01:11:18,961 --> 01:11:21,961
(Perfect combination of chocolate ice cream and fruit) 

1800
01:11:21,961 --> 01:11:23,728
You have to eat fruit when you're there. 

1801
01:11:24,294 --> 01:11:25,628
The sweetness is different. 

1802
01:11:25,628 --> 01:11:26,728
(They ended the day happily with sweet desserts) 

1803
01:11:28,761 --> 01:11:31,894
(It's time to send a signal) 

1804
01:11:32,728 --> 01:11:37,528
(Daeun nervously planned the second day) 

1805
01:11:38,761 --> 01:11:40,528
(She nervously waits for a text) 

1806
01:11:40,528 --> 01:11:42,128
(She wonders if Suji enjoyed it or not?) 

1807
01:11:47,894 --> 01:11:51,794
(Was Suji satisfied with Daeun's Day?) 

1808
01:11:58,261 --> 01:11:59,661
(From Suji) 

1809
01:11:59,661 --> 01:12:02,961
(Thank you for the photos and memories) 

1810
01:12:02,961 --> 01:12:04,328
(That'll last forever) 

1811
01:12:04,328 --> 01:12:07,494
(I'm so happy to have a friend like you) 

1812
01:12:07,494 --> 01:12:09,561
(I felt rich here in Bandung) 

1813
01:12:09,561 --> 01:12:13,028
(Let's be friends forever) 

1814
01:12:15,694 --> 01:12:19,894
(She is full of cute charm) 

1815
01:12:23,428 --> 01:12:24,928
It feels like we succeeded in becoming a couple. 

1816
01:12:24,928 --> 01:12:27,694
I'm not that happy but it's good anyway. 

1817
01:12:27,694 --> 01:12:30,461
- I'm happy. / - I'm also happy. 

1818
01:12:30,461 --> 01:12:32,494
(We guess it's all good if they're all happy) 

1819
01:12:33,628 --> 01:12:36,161
I have never been to the U.S. or Europe. 

1820
01:12:36,161 --> 01:12:39,861
So I really wanted to go there and it was my dream. 

1821
01:12:39,861 --> 01:12:41,494
But it feels like my dreams came true. 

1822
01:12:41,494 --> 01:12:44,028
- That's right. / - After I came to Bandung... 

1823
01:12:44,028 --> 01:12:46,794
It really felt like I came to Europe. 

1824
01:12:46,794 --> 01:12:49,028
I felt it wherever we went. 

1825
01:12:49,028 --> 01:12:50,461
It feels like I came to Europe. 

1826
01:12:50,461 --> 01:12:53,594
- I wish a lot of people knew it. / - Yeah. 

1827
01:12:53,594 --> 01:12:55,394
- I'm serious. / - Yes, I'm really serious. 

1828
01:12:55,394 --> 01:12:56,561
(We hope people will feel the charm of Bandung) 

1829
01:12:57,194 --> 01:12:58,861
What do you think about when you think of Indonesia? 

1830
01:12:59,228 --> 01:13:00,694
Bandung. 

1831
01:13:00,694 --> 01:13:01,961
Let's send a signal to the viewers 

1832
01:13:01,961 --> 01:13:03,961
to come to Bandung. 

1833
01:13:03,961 --> 01:13:05,094
Bandung... 

1834
01:13:05,661 --> 01:13:08,094
♪ I send you a signal, send you a signal ♪ 

1835
01:13:08,094 --> 01:13:10,828
♪ Tingling, tingling, tingling, tingling ♪ 

1836
01:13:13,628 --> 01:13:18,761
(SuDa Signal's Bandung trip, the end) 

1837
01:13:21,028 --> 01:13:22,061
From what I see... 

1838
01:13:22,061 --> 01:13:24,661
Promoting Indonesia as a cool nation was interesting. 

1839
01:13:24,661 --> 01:13:26,561
The prices are cheap too. 

1840
01:13:26,561 --> 01:13:28,461
So it will be fun to spend money. 

1841
01:13:28,461 --> 01:13:30,461
Just don't go to Bali. 

1842
01:13:30,461 --> 01:13:31,994
If you're going to Indonesia, 

1843
01:13:31,994 --> 01:13:33,061
you should visit the beach... 

1844
01:13:33,061 --> 01:13:34,994
- And then go to Bandung. / - That sounds nice. 

1845
01:13:34,994 --> 01:13:37,494
- The weather will be cool. / - It's nice to take photos. 

1846
01:13:37,494 --> 01:13:39,561
- Was it the selfie park? / - Yes. 

1847
01:13:39,561 --> 01:13:41,694
I think there are a lot of places to take photos there. 

1848
01:13:41,694 --> 01:13:43,128
- That's right. / - It really is. 

1849
01:13:43,128 --> 01:13:44,961
It's Europe on this side, 

1850
01:13:44,961 --> 01:13:46,994
then over here, it's Southeast Asia. 

1851
01:13:46,994 --> 01:13:49,161
It feels really different. It felt like a movie. 

1852
01:13:49,161 --> 01:13:50,228
The admission fee was really cheap, right? 

1853
01:13:50,228 --> 01:13:52,661
- It was $1.50. / - Yes, it was $1.50. 

1854
01:13:52,661 --> 01:13:54,894
Do you have to pay more for the carpet ride? 

1855
01:13:54,894 --> 01:13:58,094
Each theme has its own charge. 

1856
01:13:58,094 --> 01:14:01,161
So you only pay for what you want. 

1857
01:14:01,161 --> 01:14:03,494
Is the photographer included... 

1858
01:14:03,494 --> 01:14:05,794
- In that fee? / - Yes. 

1859
01:14:05,794 --> 01:14:07,094
The photographer is included in the fee. 

1860
01:14:07,094 --> 01:14:10,028
It's not $2.20 for each photo. 

1861
01:14:10,461 --> 01:14:13,061
You can receive every file for that price. 

1862
01:14:13,061 --> 01:14:14,328
When you say every file... 

1863
01:14:14,328 --> 01:14:16,428
- Do they take lots of photos? / - They keep taking them. 

1864
01:14:17,228 --> 01:14:18,628
It's so cost-effective. 

1865
01:14:18,628 --> 01:14:20,728
- Yes. / - The most important thing is... 

1866
01:14:20,728 --> 01:14:23,994
That Yeonwoo and Jooe have been totally won over. 

1867
01:14:23,994 --> 01:14:25,394
- Because of the food. / - Yes. 

1868
01:14:25,394 --> 01:14:26,561
- And the photos. / - And the desserts. 

1869
01:14:26,561 --> 01:14:27,928
They were won over by the dessert. 

1870
01:14:27,928 --> 01:14:30,094
- They enjoyed it so much. / - They like sweets. 

1871
01:14:30,461 --> 01:14:32,894
- It's really good. / - They took more than 1,000 photos. 

1872
01:14:33,861 --> 01:14:34,961
That's right. 

1873
01:14:35,328 --> 01:14:37,828
We had to delete some because the storage was full. 

1874
01:14:37,828 --> 01:14:41,794
