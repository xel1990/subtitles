(Numerous great tips on trips)

00:00:05,110 --> 00:00:06,276
(Kim Sook, Sung Sikyung)

3
00:00:07,743 --> 00:00:08,776
(Lee Hwijae, Special host, Jung Sia)

4
00:00:09,043 --> 00:00:10,276
Travel is war!

5
00:00:10,276 --> 00:00:12,843
Battle Trip!

6
00:00:14,410 --> 00:00:17,076
Our special host for this week is...

7
00:00:17,076 --> 00:00:17,876
Goodness.

8
00:00:17,876 --> 00:00:18,676
It's Jung Sia! Hello.

9
00:00:18,676 --> 00:00:20,843
- Welcome. / - Hello, I'm Jung Sia.

10
00:00:20,843 --> 00:00:23,376
Thank you for having me as a special host.

11
00:00:23,376 --> 00:00:25,043
I'm so happy to be here again.

12
00:00:25,043 --> 00:00:26,810
There's a reason we have Sia

13
00:00:26,810 --> 00:00:28,843
as the host here today.

14
00:00:28,843 --> 00:00:30,310
The real deal is here.

15
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:33,576
Today is about good tourist destinations for couples.

16
00:00:33,943 --> 00:00:36,010
That's why I'm here.

17
00:00:36,010 --> 00:00:39,010
You know my husband and I are famous lovebirds.

18
00:00:39,010 --> 00:00:41,310
- You call yourself that? / - How embarrassing.

19
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:42,343
Acknowledged.

20
00:00:42,343 --> 00:00:43,943
- It's a bit embarrassing. / - Acknowledged.

21
00:00:43,943 --> 00:00:47,076
The concept for today...

22
00:00:47,076 --> 00:00:48,643
I'm not sure.

23
00:00:48,643 --> 00:00:51,410
- Would it be relatable? / - That's true.

24
00:00:51,410 --> 00:00:53,276
- I worry about that. / - It's a relief because...

25
00:00:53,276 --> 00:00:56,110
The production staff who are single said

26
00:00:56,110 --> 00:00:58,210
they wanted to get married after watching

27
00:00:58,210 --> 00:00:59,376
today's trip designers.

28
00:00:59,376 --> 00:01:00,676
They say they really felt that.

29
00:01:00,676 --> 00:01:01,576
- Really? / - Yes.

30
00:01:01,576 --> 00:01:03,710
They're married

31
00:01:03,710 --> 00:01:05,976
but think of these trips as good for dating couples.

32
00:01:05,976 --> 00:01:08,243
That's the kind of course that they designed.

33
00:01:08,243 --> 00:01:11,010
We have amazing guests for today's episode.

34
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:12,910
Since it's a trip for couples,

35
00:01:12,910 --> 00:01:14,976
we have actual married couples

36
00:01:14,976 --> 00:01:15,776
that designed today's trips.

37
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:17,276
Here are the four trip designers for today.

38
00:01:17,276 --> 00:01:18,910
- Please come on out. / - Come on!

39
00:01:21,576 --> 00:01:22,376
Welcome.

40
00:01:22,376 --> 00:01:23,376
They're really married.

41
00:01:24,010 --> 00:01:25,043
Hello.

42
00:01:25,043 --> 00:01:26,276
They're real married couples.

43
00:01:27,543 --> 00:01:30,243
I love going on family trips.

44
00:01:30,243 --> 00:01:33,543
But Park Jiyoon's family go on trips really often.

45
00:01:33,543 --> 00:01:34,710
I guess we'll be able

46
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:37,343
to see her know-how with this trip.

47
00:01:37,343 --> 00:01:39,110
Going on trips just the two of you...

48
00:01:39,110 --> 00:01:41,010
- The opportunity to do that... / - It's not easy.

49
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:41,710
- We don't get many. / - Right?

50
00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:43,910
Since there's no one to mind the kids.

51
00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:45,410
I heard this was a meaningful trip

52
00:01:45,410 --> 00:01:46,710
for you though.

53
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:49,210
Actually, I was on paternity leave.

54
00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:50,810
I've been taking care

55
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:52,943
of our children for a while.

56
00:01:52,943 --> 00:01:54,410
It was great to go on a trip alone

57
00:01:54,410 --> 00:01:56,310
with Jiyoon after a long time.

58
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:58,243
This is his first TV appearance

59
00:01:58,243 --> 00:01:59,210
after the paternity leave.

60
00:01:59,210 --> 00:02:00,576
First after the leave.

61
00:02:00,576 --> 00:02:01,943
- Congratulations. / - Congratulations.

62
00:02:02,776 --> 00:02:04,443
How long have you been on paternity leave?

63
00:02:04,443 --> 00:02:06,210
It's been a year.

64
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:07,843
So you lived only as a father...

65
00:02:07,843 --> 00:02:08,943
- Just child care? / - For the whole year?

66
00:02:08,943 --> 00:02:10,276
- Yes. / - You took care of the house?

67
00:02:10,276 --> 00:02:10,843
For real.

68
00:02:10,843 --> 00:02:11,643
This is something...

69
00:02:11,643 --> 00:02:13,543
- You can't begin to imagine. / - That's right.

70
00:02:13,543 --> 00:02:14,643
Not everyone can do this.

71
00:02:14,643 --> 00:02:16,110
He deserves an award.

72
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:18,010
- It's been a year... / - I didn't push him into it.

73
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:20,010
Since I've met this many people.

74
00:02:20,676 --> 00:02:22,910
- That breaks my heart. / - I feel like crying.

75
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:24,876
- I'm going to cry. / - That makes me look so bad.

76
00:02:24,876 --> 00:02:26,543
He said he wanted a break.

77
00:02:26,543 --> 00:02:28,043
So I told him to take responsibility.

78
00:02:28,043 --> 00:02:29,276
But that's not taking a break.

79
00:02:29,276 --> 00:02:32,710
- It's a lot harder. / - They have two children.

80
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:36,076
Doing the housework, taking the kids to school...

81
00:02:36,076 --> 00:02:37,410
- And support your wife. / - I bet...

82
00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:39,110
You became closer to your kids.

83
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:41,176
We were very close already

84
00:02:41,176 --> 00:02:43,343
but we've become even closer.

85
00:02:43,343 --> 00:02:46,076
Even when I'm out for work like this,

86
00:02:46,076 --> 00:02:47,376
I miss my children.

87
00:02:47,376 --> 00:02:49,643
The children look for their dad every morning.

88
00:02:49,643 --> 00:02:50,410
It must upset you a little?

89
00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:52,210
Yes. They keep asking for their dad.

90
00:02:53,376 --> 00:02:56,043
- With their mom right there. / - I tell them I'm their mom.

91
00:02:56,043 --> 00:02:58,110
- I gave birth to you. / - Mom.

92
00:02:58,110 --> 00:03:00,676
And we have Zin Taehyun and Park Sieun here.

93
00:03:01,376 --> 00:03:02,643
I heard this was

94
00:03:02,643 --> 00:03:04,443
their first trip as a couple.

95
00:03:04,443 --> 00:03:06,210
- Really? / - I thought you'd travel a lot.

96
00:03:06,210 --> 00:03:07,310
- We... / - How did that happen?

97
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:08,910
Just the two of us...

98
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:10,943
We didn't even go on a honeymoon.

99
00:03:10,943 --> 00:03:13,010
So we really wanted to

100
00:03:13,010 --> 00:03:14,910
have the best time, just the two of us.

101
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:16,510
Must've been great.

102
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:18,210
Well...

103
00:03:18,210 --> 00:03:21,043
- It could be great. / - Since they don't have kids.

104
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:23,710
- That's right. / - It must've felt like dating.

105
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:26,243
It could feel like when you're dating

106
00:03:26,243 --> 00:03:28,176
but if you have different likes,

107
00:03:28,176 --> 00:03:31,376
you could have a real big fight.

108
00:03:31,376 --> 00:03:32,510
You're so pessimistic.

109
00:03:33,243 --> 00:03:33,710
It's because...

110
00:03:33,710 --> 00:03:35,043
You must've fought a lot.

111
00:03:35,043 --> 00:03:36,576
- Not a lot. / - He's so pessimistic.

112
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:38,210
When was the last time you had a fight, Hwijae?

113
00:03:38,876 --> 00:03:39,910
Yesterday?

114
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:40,743
It wasn't yesterday.

115
00:03:40,743 --> 00:03:42,076
- This morning? / - No, no.

116
00:03:42,076 --> 00:03:43,010
Don't be like that.

117
00:03:43,010 --> 00:03:44,443
Did you guys ever fight and not talk to each other?

118
00:03:44,443 --> 00:03:46,476
We don't fight.

119
00:03:46,476 --> 00:03:47,743
You've never fought for the past 3 years?

120
00:03:47,743 --> 00:03:49,410
Sometimes, we get upset

121
00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:51,610
and so on...

122
00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:53,443
- But fighting... / - He admits his wrong real fast.

123
00:03:53,443 --> 00:03:55,110
He admits his mistakes right away?

124
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:56,043
- Yes. / - That's right.

125
00:03:56,043 --> 00:03:58,176
I'm curious about where they went.

126
00:03:58,176 --> 00:03:59,676
Sia, where do you want to go?

127
00:03:59,676 --> 00:04:01,710
I've never been on a trip alone

128
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:02,976
with my husband since the honeymoon.

129
00:04:02,976 --> 00:04:03,710
Goodness.

130
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:05,076
I've never been.

131
00:04:05,076 --> 00:04:07,576
Going on a trip without the kids?

132
00:04:07,576 --> 00:04:09,043
I've never even thought about it.

133
00:04:09,043 --> 00:04:10,943
Hwijae, where would you go?

134
00:04:10,943 --> 00:04:12,143
Where would you go if you can go alone?

135
00:04:12,143 --> 00:04:12,976
- Alone? / - Yes.

136
00:04:12,976 --> 00:04:13,743
- If you go alone. / -  So many places.

137
00:04:13,743 --> 00:04:15,876
I can go anywhere if it's alone.

138
00:04:15,876 --> 00:04:17,010
- I'd be so... / -  Okay then.

139
00:04:17,010 --> 00:04:18,743
About with your wife?

140
00:04:18,743 --> 00:04:19,943
Where would I go?

141
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:23,076
Alright then.

142
00:04:23,076 --> 00:04:24,076
Therefore,

143
00:04:24,076 --> 00:04:25,643
experts in traveling,

144
00:04:25,643 --> 00:04:28,043
Park Jiyoon and Choi Dongseok

145
00:04:28,043 --> 00:04:30,676
chose which location for their trip? I'm curious.

146
00:04:30,676 --> 00:04:31,643
I'm so curious.

147
00:04:31,643 --> 00:04:34,210
It's important for us to have fun

148
00:04:34,210 --> 00:04:37,043
but we have our duty as trip designers.

149
00:04:37,043 --> 00:04:40,610
So I wanted to go to a place I've been before.

150
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:41,876
Luckily, there was a place

151
00:04:41,876 --> 00:04:44,276
where both of us went to twice.

152
00:04:44,976 --> 00:04:46,076
When we had our first

153
00:04:46,076 --> 00:04:48,976
and were exhausted with child care.

154
00:04:48,976 --> 00:04:51,843
So our parents begged us to go on a trip.

155
00:04:51,843 --> 00:04:53,576
- Really? / - We didn't plan anything and...

156
00:04:53,576 --> 00:04:54,510
- Just you two? / - Just left for Bali.

157
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:56,876
Yes. It was so great.

158
00:04:56,876 --> 00:04:59,610
We have a very good memory of the place.

159
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:01,443
- So it's your third time? / - Yes.

160
00:05:01,443 --> 00:05:02,510
Bali.

161
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:05,576
Bali is very famous for honeymoons.

162
00:05:05,576 --> 00:05:06,810
That's nice.

163
00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:09,476
Since it's a famous tourist attraction,

164
00:05:09,476 --> 00:05:10,743
I was worried their trip would be predictable.

165
00:05:10,743 --> 00:05:12,176
But if they're this attached to it...

166
00:05:12,176 --> 00:05:13,343
- Since they've been a few times... / - Right.

167
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:15,976
They could've found someplace new there.

168
00:05:15,976 --> 00:05:17,810
I guarantee, when you see this,

169
00:05:17,810 --> 00:05:19,976
you'll be surprised that such places exist in Bali.

170
00:05:19,976 --> 00:05:21,610
- We love things like that. / - You'll be shocked.

171
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:24,010
There are a lot of things

172
00:05:24,010 --> 00:05:25,110
that women would love.

173
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:26,610
What about you two?

174
00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:29,576
- You've never taken a trip together. / - Yeah.

175
00:05:29,576 --> 00:05:31,143
I wonder where you chose to go.

176
00:05:31,143 --> 00:05:33,076
We went to a less known place

177
00:05:33,076 --> 00:05:36,310
because we wanted to introduce it to you.

178
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:38,443
- It's Penang in Malaysia. / - Penang.

179
00:05:38,443 --> 00:05:39,743
- Penang? / - Penang.

180
00:05:39,743 --> 00:05:40,743
- I've never heard of that place. / - Penang.

181
00:05:40,743 --> 00:05:42,243
Why did you choose Penang?

182
00:05:42,243 --> 00:05:45,076
In fact, we like to walk a lot.

183
00:05:45,076 --> 00:05:46,043
So...

184
00:05:46,043 --> 00:05:48,843
- I thought it'd be too boring to just rest. / - Right.

185
00:05:48,843 --> 00:05:50,910
So I wanted to go some place where

186
00:05:50,910 --> 00:05:52,676
we can do sightseeing and move around.

187
00:05:52,676 --> 00:05:54,843
I wanted a place that has a lot to see and enjoy.

188
00:05:54,843 --> 00:05:56,443
Penang was perfect for that.

189
00:05:56,443 --> 00:05:59,476
And Sieun's sister recommended it.

190
00:05:59,476 --> 00:06:01,176
She lived in Malaysia for a long time.

191
00:06:01,176 --> 00:06:02,176
So you got a recommendation.

192
00:06:02,176 --> 00:06:04,276
It's very unique.

193
00:06:04,276 --> 00:06:06,243
They have various cultures.

194
00:06:06,243 --> 00:06:09,010
They have the culture of England, India, China

195
00:06:09,010 --> 00:06:11,176
and Malaysia mixed in that small island.

196
00:06:11,176 --> 00:06:12,843
The food must be good.

197
00:06:12,843 --> 00:06:14,676
- The food was really good. / - The food...

198
00:06:14,676 --> 00:06:15,610
That means...

199
00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:17,643
We could be hearing about a Penang baby.

200
00:06:18,976 --> 00:06:20,343
Well...

201
00:06:20,343 --> 00:06:21,643
The birth name could be Penang.

202
00:06:21,643 --> 00:06:22,543
- Penang. / - That's cute.

203
00:06:22,543 --> 00:06:24,443
Why are your eyes so wide, Taehyun?

204
00:06:24,443 --> 00:06:25,376
They're not.

205
00:06:26,376 --> 00:06:28,443
It's time to watch their trips.

206
00:06:28,443 --> 00:06:30,376
Even though they went on a trip together,

207
00:06:30,376 --> 00:06:31,843
their memories may differ.

208
00:06:31,843 --> 00:06:34,043
- Right. / - Even with the same experiences.

209
00:06:34,043 --> 00:06:37,043
So we divided the men and women in separate rooms.

210
00:06:37,943 --> 00:06:39,976
To ruin their relationships

211
00:06:39,976 --> 00:06:41,376
as much as possible.

212
00:06:43,076 --> 00:06:44,043
They had different ideas.

213
00:06:44,043 --> 00:06:46,843
So we get upset after watching the footage?

214
00:06:46,843 --> 00:06:48,343
When I'm with

215
00:06:48,343 --> 00:06:50,643
Sikyung and Hwijae...

216
00:06:50,643 --> 00:06:52,443
There were times when I couldn't get through to them.

217
00:06:52,443 --> 00:06:54,076
- What? / - It's such a great thing.

218
00:06:54,076 --> 00:06:55,443
I feel like it's so great but they...

219
00:06:55,443 --> 00:06:56,610
That wedding shoot by yourself?

220
00:06:56,610 --> 00:06:57,776
- Huh? / - The wedding photos.

221
00:06:57,776 --> 00:06:58,510
When I did the self-wedding.

222
00:06:58,510 --> 00:07:00,443
- I was really moved by that. / - That was great.

223
00:07:00,443 --> 00:07:01,876
It was so good.

224
00:07:01,876 --> 00:07:03,576
- It was really good, wasn't it? / - Yes, totally.

225
00:07:03,576 --> 00:07:04,276
I saw it.

226
00:07:04,276 --> 00:07:05,476
It was so good.

227
00:07:05,476 --> 00:07:06,543
They just don't understand.

228
00:07:06,543 --> 00:07:08,710
What's good about a self-wedding?

229
00:07:08,710 --> 00:07:09,576
It was great.

230
00:07:09,576 --> 00:07:11,110
What's good about it?

231
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:13,310
Go and watch the Manchester derby.

232
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:14,776
When you're the prettiest...

233
00:07:14,776 --> 00:07:16,643
- When you're younger... / - People take them.

234
00:07:16,643 --> 00:07:17,476
This is perfect.

235
00:07:17,476 --> 00:07:18,410
- It's nice. / - Hurry up.

236
00:07:18,410 --> 00:07:19,843
Let's divide the teams.

237
00:07:19,843 --> 00:07:21,643
Alright then.

238
00:07:21,643 --> 00:07:24,043
I hope many people would

239
00:07:24,043 --> 00:07:26,843
want to get married after watching

240
00:07:26,843 --> 00:07:28,443
these couple's trips.

241
00:07:28,443 --> 00:07:29,376
Shall we?

242
00:07:29,376 --> 00:07:31,710
- Move to our rooms? / - Divide up.

243
00:07:31,710 --> 00:07:32,210
- Let's go. / - Then first...

244
00:07:32,210 --> 00:07:33,576
- The men first. / - Choi Dongseok...

245
00:07:33,576 --> 00:07:35,576
And Park Jiyoon's Bali trip.

246
00:07:35,576 --> 00:07:36,843
Let's watch that first.

247
00:07:36,843 --> 00:07:37,676
Men, this way.

248
00:07:37,676 --> 00:07:39,743
Ladies, enjoy the footage.

249
00:07:43,643 --> 00:07:45,143
- Hello. / - Hello.

250
00:07:45,143 --> 00:07:46,343
Hello.

251
00:07:46,343 --> 00:07:47,776
Hello.

252
00:07:47,776 --> 00:07:48,943
I want to get a photo of a lifetime.

253
00:07:49,976 --> 00:07:51,643
- I'll have to take it. / - That's right.

254
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:54,910
You're the first couple to go on a trip in Battle Trip.

255
00:07:54,910 --> 00:07:57,376
- Are we the first couple? / - Yes.

256
00:07:58,876 --> 00:08:00,543
- This is so exciting. / - They'd feel shy.

257
00:08:00,543 --> 00:08:01,543
She's good.

258
00:08:02,376 --> 00:08:04,976
We met during the test for anchors.

259
00:08:04,976 --> 00:08:06,510
We joined the company at the same time.

260
00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:07,643
I met her during the third interview.

261
00:08:07,643 --> 00:08:09,476
You two joined the company in the same year?

262
00:08:09,476 --> 00:08:10,376
Yes.

263
00:08:10,376 --> 00:08:13,276
We met at the training institute. We became attached.

264
00:08:13,276 --> 00:08:14,943
She says I used to be annoying.

265
00:08:16,210 --> 00:08:18,243
He was reading his scrapbook alone there.

266
00:08:18,243 --> 00:08:20,976
So I didn't want him to pass the test.

267
00:08:23,310 --> 00:08:24,443
He wasn't my type.

268
00:08:24,443 --> 00:08:26,276
My husband wasn't my type either.

269
00:08:26,276 --> 00:08:28,143
- But I ended up with him. / - I know.

270
00:08:30,376 --> 00:08:31,276
They've grown a lot.

271
00:08:32,043 --> 00:08:34,076
We've experienced that a lot.

272
00:08:34,076 --> 00:08:35,543
But going on a trip just

273
00:08:35,543 --> 00:08:37,010
the two of us...

274
00:08:37,010 --> 00:08:38,076
- Maybe once or twice? / - Less than five times.

275
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:41,043
We went to Bali just the two of us.

276
00:08:41,043 --> 00:08:42,643
It was like a honeymoon.

277
00:08:42,643 --> 00:08:44,143
It was really...

278
00:08:44,143 --> 00:08:44,976
I have great memories from that trip.

279
00:08:44,976 --> 00:08:45,976
Bali for us...

280
00:08:45,976 --> 00:08:47,010
- Is very special. / - Let's go there.

281
00:08:47,010 --> 00:08:48,576
- Decided on Bali. / - Nice.

282
00:08:48,576 --> 00:08:50,476
There's the Seminyak main road

283
00:08:50,476 --> 00:08:51,776
where there's a lot of restaurants.

284
00:08:51,776 --> 00:08:53,710
The place we went to cost about $100.

285
00:08:53,710 --> 00:08:56,876
I did some research last night.

286
00:08:56,876 --> 00:08:58,343
There's a good hotel in Ubud.

287
00:08:58,343 --> 00:09:00,110
- For two nights... / - It feels like...

288
00:09:00,110 --> 00:09:02,476
They're here at our travel agency.

289
00:09:02,476 --> 00:09:04,043
Jiyoon was like a tour guide.

290
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:05,376
Did you do the research yourself?

291
00:09:05,376 --> 00:09:07,976
I always do it myself.

292
00:09:07,976 --> 00:09:10,843
- I plan out the perfect itinerary. / - That's amazing.

293
00:09:16,176 --> 00:09:18,576
Trees are so beautiful in Bali.

294
00:09:18,576 --> 00:09:20,610
The wood products are pretty too.

295
00:09:22,243 --> 00:09:23,576
Rattan bags.

296
00:09:23,576 --> 00:09:24,543
Trays.

297
00:09:24,543 --> 00:09:27,210
- Chopsticks. Spoons. / - We'll buy as little as possible.

298
00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:28,976
What's a rattan bag?

299
00:09:28,976 --> 00:09:30,276
Something big and expensive.

300
00:09:30,276 --> 00:09:31,776
- Shopping. / - Must buy them.

301
00:09:31,776 --> 00:09:32,510
Rattan bags?

302
00:09:32,510 --> 00:09:34,476
I bought 100 cat dolls in Bali.

303
00:09:35,610 --> 00:09:37,510
- Cats dolls? / - Wooden cat dolls.

304
00:09:40,743 --> 00:09:42,043
Maybe it's because she's been on lots of food shows.

305
00:09:42,043 --> 00:09:43,576
She's a food expert.

306
00:09:43,876 --> 00:09:44,943
It's so delicious.

307
00:09:47,043 --> 00:09:47,976
(The dish is empty)

308
00:09:50,710 --> 00:09:52,410
220.

309
00:09:53,410 --> 00:09:54,610
220. 220.

310
00:09:54,610 --> 00:09:56,510
- Did you go to Ubud? / - Ubud.

311
00:09:56,510 --> 00:09:58,010
The traditional market, yes.

312
00:09:58,010 --> 00:09:58,810
Photo spot.

313
00:09:59,443 --> 00:10:00,343
Photo spot.

314
00:10:00,343 --> 00:10:02,776
- She looks so pretty. / - Picture of a lifetime!

315
00:10:02,776 --> 00:10:04,576
(Jiyoon is the queen of social media)

316
00:10:04,843 --> 00:10:06,910
Dongseok, you like taking pictures, don't you?

317
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:09,543
Actually, I prefer taking videos to pictures these days.

318
00:10:09,543 --> 00:10:11,243
Once we're there,

319
00:10:11,243 --> 00:10:13,510
you might think we have two directors.

320
00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:15,076
Goodness!

321
00:10:15,876 --> 00:10:17,776
Isn't that a professional camera?

322
00:10:17,776 --> 00:10:18,876
Whose camera is that?

323
00:10:18,876 --> 00:10:20,543
- It's his. / - On all the trips I've been on...

324
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:22,110
I've never

325
00:10:22,110 --> 00:10:25,176
been able to do as I wish.

326
00:10:25,176 --> 00:10:27,076
Because

327
00:10:27,076 --> 00:10:28,976
I have to do as I'm told.

328
00:10:28,976 --> 00:10:31,110
He doesn't have his own will.

329
00:10:31,110 --> 00:10:32,176
Even if I do something on my own,

330
00:10:32,176 --> 00:10:33,210
it doesn't work out.

331
00:10:34,076 --> 00:10:35,810
When I tell him to load the luggage, he does.

332
00:10:35,810 --> 00:10:36,943
When I tell him to stand up, he does.

333
00:10:37,776 --> 00:10:39,776
Wait for me.

334
00:10:40,176 --> 00:10:42,176
You were really pretty.

335
00:10:43,043 --> 00:10:44,443
Because you're pretty.

336
00:10:44,443 --> 00:10:46,510
It's like an artwork.

337
00:10:47,243 --> 00:10:49,276
A guy...

338
00:10:49,276 --> 00:10:50,776
Should walk next to the road.

339
00:10:50,776 --> 00:10:52,910
(The hidden romanticist, Choi Dongseok)

340
00:10:53,410 --> 00:10:55,710
- Are our opponents a married couple? / - Are they?

341
00:10:55,710 --> 00:10:57,376
It's Zin Taehyun and Park Sieun.

342
00:10:58,543 --> 00:11:00,710
They're not a real married couple yet.

343
00:11:00,710 --> 00:11:02,510
I bet they always feel like they're in paradise.

344
00:11:02,510 --> 00:11:04,443
We did a high-five in hell

345
00:11:04,443 --> 00:11:05,743
then back up to paradise...

346
00:11:06,410 --> 00:11:08,143
Do you want to have a fight on the trip?

347
00:11:09,143 --> 00:11:10,376
You're not fighting, right?

348
00:11:10,376 --> 00:11:11,710
We always have a tour name.

349
00:11:11,710 --> 00:11:12,910
Since I'm back to work...

350
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:13,843
Then?

351
00:11:14,810 --> 00:11:17,010
- Reset Tour? / - Reset Tour?

352
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:18,243
Reset Tour sounds good.

353
00:11:18,243 --> 00:11:19,310
It means this tour...

354
00:11:19,310 --> 00:11:20,876
- Will reset love and stress... / - Same with work.

355
00:11:20,876 --> 00:11:21,743
It'll be a restart.

356
00:11:21,743 --> 00:11:23,076
- Reset Tour. / - Great name.

357
00:11:23,076 --> 00:11:25,010
Let's start with "turn things back."

358
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:27,610
??Turn things back ??

359
00:11:27,610 --> 00:11:29,243
??To before I met you ??

360
00:11:29,243 --> 00:11:31,410
??To the way I used to be before I met you ??

361
00:11:31,943 --> 00:11:33,776
Let's go back to when we first met each other.

362
00:11:33,776 --> 00:11:35,643
Let's reset our love.

363
00:11:35,643 --> 00:11:37,776
??Turn things back ??

364
00:11:37,776 --> 00:11:39,510
What was that?

365
00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:42,176
- Was that slapstick? / - He did slapstick.

366
00:11:42,176 --> 00:11:44,010
My goal is to

367
00:11:44,010 --> 00:11:46,343
introduce photo spots that can get 10,000 likes.

368
00:11:46,343 --> 00:11:48,243
Concentration, purity, 100%.

369
00:11:48,243 --> 00:11:50,176
- So thick. / - It's pretty even now.

370
00:11:52,476 --> 00:11:54,110
My goodness.

371
00:11:54,110 --> 00:11:56,310
I'm a little scared of heights.

372
00:11:58,310 --> 00:11:59,343
Why is it so high?

373
00:12:00,276 --> 00:12:01,276
(We must go there)

374
00:12:01,276 --> 00:12:02,710
- What is that? / - There was such a place?

375
00:12:02,710 --> 00:12:04,243
- It's like their honeymoon. / - Your first time, right?

376
00:12:04,876 --> 00:12:07,010
It's so nice. That's an amazing picture.

377
00:12:07,010 --> 00:12:09,110
- It's really like their honeymoon. / - I want to go.

378
00:12:09,110 --> 00:12:10,776
It's a romantic couple trip.

379
00:12:10,776 --> 00:12:12,643
We were holding our hands.

380
00:12:12,643 --> 00:12:14,910
It has been my dream to go on a trip like this.

381
00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:16,843
A romantic love will well up here.

382
00:12:20,076 --> 00:12:20,876
Oh, this...

383
00:12:22,776 --> 00:12:24,876
I want to delete this one.

384
00:12:24,876 --> 00:12:25,943
Oh, this!

385
00:12:25,943 --> 00:12:27,276
You look so hot.

386
00:12:27,276 --> 00:12:28,643
- You look really hot. / - Reset Tour.

387
00:12:28,643 --> 00:12:30,343
??Turn things back! ??

388
00:12:32,043 --> 00:12:33,743
I don't think you need to reset anything.

389
00:12:33,743 --> 00:12:35,276
- You two look so happy. / - I know.

390
00:12:35,276 --> 00:12:36,643
This is just a preview.

391
00:12:39,710 --> 00:12:40,643
What did you pack?

392
00:12:41,476 --> 00:12:43,543
Why do you look so down from the beginning?

393
00:12:43,543 --> 00:12:44,510
Because he has to carry all the luggage.

394
00:12:44,510 --> 00:12:47,276
I packed a few bricks for you.

395
00:12:47,276 --> 00:12:48,443
He looks like her manager.

396
00:12:49,410 --> 00:12:49,943
He's her manager.

397
00:12:49,943 --> 00:12:51,343
- She walks ahead. / - Wait...

398
00:12:51,343 --> 00:12:52,710
Sikyung, that's what happens.

399
00:12:52,710 --> 00:12:54,143
You become a manager when you get married.

400
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:57,143
Except for the plans, your husband does everything.

401
00:12:57,143 --> 00:13:00,276
There has to be someone who makes the plans work.

402
00:13:00,276 --> 00:13:01,510
And carry the luggage.

403
00:13:01,510 --> 00:13:02,843
How many times have you been to Bali?

404
00:13:02,843 --> 00:13:03,910
Bali?

405
00:13:04,743 --> 00:13:05,810
You've been there more than I have.

406
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:08,910
I haven't traveled to Bali without you.

407
00:13:09,243 --> 00:13:11,576
There are people who always ask that.

408
00:13:12,110 --> 00:13:12,976
Really?

409
00:13:15,743 --> 00:13:16,810
Who did you go to Bali with?

410
00:13:18,010 --> 00:13:19,610
Who did you go with without me?

411
00:13:19,610 --> 00:13:21,143
What are you saying from the beginning?

412
00:13:21,976 --> 00:13:24,343
Have you been anywhere without me?

413
00:13:24,343 --> 00:13:25,776
I'm taken aback right now.

414
00:13:26,643 --> 00:13:28,143
Does something come to mind?

415
00:13:29,176 --> 00:13:31,476
This is just like the last time.

416
00:13:31,476 --> 00:13:33,143
That restaurant in front of Kyunghee University.

417
00:13:33,143 --> 00:13:35,143
I've never been there but you have.

418
00:13:36,176 --> 00:13:37,810
It's still a mystery to me.

419
00:13:37,810 --> 00:13:39,710
I have never been there.

420
00:13:39,710 --> 00:13:40,976
- Who did you go there with? / - This is why...

421
00:13:40,976 --> 00:13:42,943
You always have to say you haven't been there.

422
00:13:42,943 --> 00:13:44,343
You always have to say you don't know anything.

423
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:47,743
I think this is the best part of traveling.

424
00:13:47,743 --> 00:13:50,143
This might be the last moment we're feeling good.

425
00:13:50,143 --> 00:13:51,010
Let's hurry.

426
00:13:53,043 --> 00:13:54,443
Jiyoon, come down now.

427
00:13:55,910 --> 00:13:56,876
This is so nice.

428
00:13:56,876 --> 00:13:58,543
I love the start of the trip.

429
00:13:58,543 --> 00:14:00,276
- Wow. / - He's carrying her now.

430
00:14:00,276 --> 00:14:02,410
How romantic!

431
00:14:02,410 --> 00:14:05,010
I've never done that before. I should try that too.

432
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:06,810
- The kids always do it so... / - You'll bust a wheel!

433
00:14:06,810 --> 00:14:08,343
- Only children can do it. / - I was jealous.

434
00:14:08,343 --> 00:14:10,410
I thought we left the kids but I found a new one.

435
00:14:11,676 --> 00:14:13,310
Is that it?

436
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:14,310
Please load the luggage.

437
00:14:15,776 --> 00:14:17,176
(Ubud)

438
00:14:17,176 --> 00:14:17,976
(Seminyak)

439
00:14:17,976 --> 00:14:19,210
(Nusa Dua)

440
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:22,043
(Nusa Dua)

441
00:14:22,043 --> 00:14:23,210
It's so big.

442
00:14:26,676 --> 00:14:28,876
(Hahaha)

443
00:14:30,043 --> 00:14:32,510
The resort staff thought it's our honeymoon...

444
00:14:32,510 --> 00:14:34,543
- And they prepared all these. / - It's so nice.

445
00:14:34,543 --> 00:14:37,076
I've never seen that before.

446
00:14:38,876 --> 00:14:40,010
Gosh, look at that.

447
00:14:41,476 --> 00:14:43,210
Goodness. It's too much.

448
00:14:43,210 --> 00:14:45,010
- In the bath? / - The bath.

449
00:14:45,010 --> 00:14:46,043
Who's going to clean all this?

450
00:14:46,043 --> 00:14:47,343
Isn't that too much?

451
00:14:47,343 --> 00:14:49,776
It'd be a shame if you just clean it and sleep there.

452
00:14:49,776 --> 00:14:51,810
I cleaned the bathtub.

453
00:14:52,910 --> 00:14:54,843
I ended up with a full basket of petals.

454
00:14:54,843 --> 00:14:56,443
Can't you just use the bathtub like that?

455
00:14:56,443 --> 00:14:57,410
Must take photos of this.

456
00:14:57,410 --> 00:14:59,276
This is really well made.

457
00:14:59,276 --> 00:15:01,010
Since you always make the reservations...

458
00:15:02,543 --> 00:15:05,810
- Mr. Park Jiyoon. / - They call me Mr. Park.

459
00:15:08,776 --> 00:15:10,310
- It's a pool right in a front. / - A swimming pool.

460
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:12,810
I've never been to a room

461
00:15:12,810 --> 00:15:14,243
that is right next to a pool.

462
00:15:14,243 --> 00:15:15,776
We have no time to chill, do we?

463
00:15:15,776 --> 00:15:18,843
Let's meet up in the lobby tomorrow at 7:30 a.m.

464
00:15:19,943 --> 00:15:24,110
(First day of Park Jiyoon's trip plan)

465
00:15:25,376 --> 00:15:29,210
(Everyone dreams of a vacation in a warm country)

466
00:15:31,443 --> 00:15:33,043
So nice.

467
00:15:33,710 --> 00:15:35,110
Where are we going?

468
00:15:35,110 --> 00:15:37,110
We're going somewhere far away.

469
00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:38,910
A taxi...

470
00:15:38,910 --> 00:15:40,476
No need.

471
00:15:40,476 --> 00:15:41,276
I prepared something.

472
00:15:41,276 --> 00:15:41,910
Are we walking there?

473
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:44,243
I rented a car.

474
00:15:45,176 --> 00:15:46,643
Do I have to drive?

475
00:15:47,710 --> 00:15:48,843
If you rent a car in Bali,

476
00:15:48,843 --> 00:15:50,243
a driver comes with it.

477
00:15:50,243 --> 00:15:53,010
- We're traveling with a driver? / - Yes.

478
00:15:53,010 --> 00:15:54,776
For 12 hours.

479
00:15:54,776 --> 00:15:56,643
I can't believe it's only $40.

480
00:15:56,643 --> 00:15:57,476
So cozy.

481
00:15:57,476 --> 00:15:59,376
Bali is quite big.

482
00:15:59,376 --> 00:16:02,143
So, many people either give up going to different

483
00:16:02,143 --> 00:16:03,876
places or move to different hotel.

484
00:16:03,876 --> 00:16:05,576
- You're right. / - I have never done this before...

485
00:16:05,576 --> 00:16:06,776
But it was so good.

486
00:16:06,776 --> 00:16:09,043
We came all the way to Bali to refresh ourselves

487
00:16:09,043 --> 00:16:10,443
from the routine of daily life.

488
00:16:10,443 --> 00:16:11,543
Let me show you what's amazing.

489
00:16:11,543 --> 00:16:14,110
We need to overcome our trauma.

490
00:16:14,110 --> 00:16:16,276
I don't want to do anything scary. Let's not do it.

491
00:16:16,276 --> 00:16:17,476
He must be faint-hearted.

492
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:18,843
This can leave us

493
00:16:18,843 --> 00:16:20,576
with a photo of a lifetime.

494
00:16:20,576 --> 00:16:23,143
- This equals 10,000 likes. / - For a photo?

495
00:16:25,276 --> 00:16:26,776
How would you ride that?

496
00:16:26,776 --> 00:16:28,010
It was so scary.

497
00:16:28,010 --> 00:16:29,143
This is scary?

498
00:16:29,143 --> 00:16:30,076
It's very scary.

499
00:16:30,910 --> 00:16:32,276
I don't think that's a good idea.

500
00:16:35,210 --> 00:16:36,243
Everything looks like a photoshoot.

501
00:16:36,243 --> 00:16:38,143
They're all doing photoshoots.

502
00:16:38,143 --> 00:16:39,076
So pretty.

503
00:16:40,876 --> 00:16:42,610
(They're scared now that it's right in front of them)

504
00:16:44,476 --> 00:16:45,610
Mommy!

505
00:16:46,176 --> 00:16:48,043
Why is this place still unknown?

506
00:16:48,043 --> 00:16:49,910
Many Koreans don't know about this place.

507
00:16:49,910 --> 00:16:52,043
Shouldn't they do magazine shoots there?

508
00:16:52,043 --> 00:16:53,210
If it's this pretty?

509
00:16:56,110 --> 00:16:57,576
It's a bit...

510
00:16:57,576 --> 00:16:59,976
It seems like we have to sign an agreement.

511
00:16:59,976 --> 00:17:00,843
A stamp.

512
00:17:00,843 --> 00:17:02,543
It's a little over $35.

513
00:17:02,543 --> 00:17:04,210
What do you get for that price?

514
00:17:04,210 --> 00:17:06,276
- All-you-can-eat food and drinks. / - You get food?

515
00:17:06,276 --> 00:17:07,410
You can also ride the swing as much as you want.

516
00:17:08,010 --> 00:17:09,443
So food is included.

517
00:17:09,443 --> 00:17:11,010
I thought it cost $30 to just ride a swing.

518
00:17:11,010 --> 00:17:12,910
It'd be too expensive for just that.

519
00:17:17,076 --> 00:17:18,810
This one is 5m.

520
00:17:18,810 --> 00:17:19,576
Yes, 5m.

521
00:17:19,576 --> 00:17:21,010
10m, 15m.

522
00:17:25,776 --> 00:17:28,610
I'll take the 10m one, good for sharing on SNS.

523
00:17:34,110 --> 00:17:37,443
That one's actually less scary.

524
00:17:37,443 --> 00:17:38,643
This one's the scariest.

525
00:17:38,643 --> 00:17:40,143
Is this the scary one?

526
00:17:40,143 --> 00:17:40,943
I'm more nervous.

527
00:17:44,976 --> 00:17:46,443
I don't think I can do this.

528
00:17:49,643 --> 00:17:52,776
My outfit stood out the least there.

529
00:17:52,776 --> 00:17:53,743
They all wore dresses.

530
00:17:53,743 --> 00:17:54,443
Bravo.

531
00:17:54,443 --> 00:17:57,010
- Why? / - You need to wear a dress.

532
00:17:57,010 --> 00:17:58,143
- It needs to flutter. / - You must.

533
00:17:58,143 --> 00:17:59,776
- That's right. / - You need to flutter.

534
00:17:59,776 --> 00:18:01,210
All for a photo?

535
00:18:01,210 --> 00:18:02,976
That place is so popular these days.

536
00:18:02,976 --> 00:18:05,476
People wear dresses to take photos.

537
00:18:06,976 --> 00:18:09,410
To let their dresses flutter as they take photos.

538
00:18:17,643 --> 00:18:20,643
I'm sure he didn't expect us to go to Bali Swing.

539
00:18:20,643 --> 00:18:21,810
Because I'm

540
00:18:21,810 --> 00:18:23,810
a little scared of heights.

541
00:18:23,810 --> 00:18:25,776
I can't even go on rollercoaster rides.

542
00:18:25,776 --> 00:18:28,443
But this was the thing I wanted to

543
00:18:28,443 --> 00:18:29,776
do the most in Bali.

544
00:18:29,776 --> 00:18:32,976
- It's that good? / - If I don't try it now...

545
00:18:32,976 --> 00:18:36,043
I thought I'd never be able to.

546
00:18:36,043 --> 00:18:37,476
- Hello. / - You can do this.

547
00:18:40,376 --> 00:18:41,776
The staff are very professional.

548
00:18:41,776 --> 00:18:43,310
- They adjust your dress for you. / - They adjust it.

549
00:18:43,310 --> 00:18:45,010
- So it flutters well. / - Yes.

550
00:18:49,243 --> 00:18:51,343
- Ready? / - Yes, I'm ready.

551
00:18:51,343 --> 00:18:54,476
Bali Swing!

552
00:18:54,476 --> 00:18:55,443
Ah!

553
00:18:55,443 --> 00:18:56,976
Mommy!

554
00:18:58,776 --> 00:18:59,343
Mommy!

555
00:18:59,343 --> 00:19:00,343
Good thing you wore the dress.

556
00:19:00,343 --> 00:19:01,476
You look pretty.

557
00:19:01,476 --> 00:19:03,343
- Bali Swing. / - She really looks pretty.

558
00:19:06,276 --> 00:19:07,743
Bali Swing!

559
00:19:09,043 --> 00:19:10,676
They tell you to look left.

560
00:19:10,676 --> 00:19:12,276
You have to look when they tell you to.

561
00:19:12,276 --> 00:19:13,743
That's how you get a good photo.

562
00:19:13,743 --> 00:19:14,976
They know all about it.

563
00:19:15,676 --> 00:19:16,543
Left.

564
00:19:16,543 --> 00:19:17,876
- It's like a commercial. / - Left.

565
00:19:18,810 --> 00:19:21,310
(She manages to take the perfect photo in Bali)

566
00:19:22,510 --> 00:19:23,276
So beautiful.

567
00:19:23,276 --> 00:19:24,476
All for that one photo.

568
00:19:24,476 --> 00:19:25,910
You have to frame that one.

569
00:19:26,976 --> 00:19:28,676
I did think the photo looked pretty great

570
00:19:28,676 --> 00:19:29,610
after I had taken it.

571
00:19:29,610 --> 00:19:30,810
The photo came out very nicely.

572
00:19:34,276 --> 00:19:35,343
(Laughing)

573
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:39,110
Stop.

574
00:19:39,976 --> 00:19:41,576
Never stop. Never stop.

575
00:19:41,576 --> 00:19:42,676
Stop it.

576
00:19:44,476 --> 00:19:46,043
(The swing soars up to the sky)

577
00:19:47,476 --> 00:19:50,410
If you open a dress shop there, you'd rake it in.

578
00:19:50,410 --> 00:19:51,643
It's so popular here.

579
00:19:51,643 --> 00:19:52,676
We need to take photos when no one is around.

580
00:19:52,676 --> 00:19:53,576
Let's take one over there.

581
00:19:54,443 --> 00:19:55,610
Let's go into the nest.

582
00:19:57,210 --> 00:19:58,543
(Dongseok enters manager mode)

583
00:20:00,410 --> 00:20:01,976
(He takes her shoes without being asked to do so)

584
00:20:02,776 --> 00:20:04,743
Move back a bit more. Move back more.

585
00:20:05,976 --> 00:20:07,243
You have to look at the side.

586
00:20:11,476 --> 00:20:12,976
- I want to go to Bali. / - He's a great photographer.

587
00:20:12,976 --> 00:20:14,076
He's good.

588
00:20:14,076 --> 00:20:14,976
It's so pretty.

589
00:20:18,143 --> 00:20:18,943
How about this?

590
00:20:21,043 --> 00:20:22,543
That's perfect for Jiyoon.

591
00:20:23,676 --> 00:20:26,076
It was really impressive to see him

592
00:20:26,076 --> 00:20:29,110
take the photos and be as excited as her.

593
00:20:33,510 --> 00:20:34,610
Stay still.

594
00:20:36,910 --> 00:20:38,710
Look at me like you're in love with me.

595
00:20:43,543 --> 00:20:44,610
I can't trust you.

596
00:20:51,176 --> 00:20:52,610
That's so pretty.

597
00:20:52,610 --> 00:20:54,476
They really look like newlyweds.

598
00:20:54,476 --> 00:20:55,510
Let's eat.

599
00:20:55,510 --> 00:20:57,343
I have to visit this place.

600
00:20:57,343 --> 00:20:58,776
With Ubud...

601
00:20:58,776 --> 00:21:01,243
I did some research last night.

602
00:21:01,243 --> 00:21:03,510
There's a famous roasted duck restaurant there.

603
00:21:03,510 --> 00:21:05,743
- Is it grilled mineral-fed duck? / - No, it's not.

604
00:21:05,743 --> 00:21:08,043
Is Bali famous for roasted duck?

605
00:21:08,043 --> 00:21:10,476
China pops in my head when I think about duck.

606
00:21:10,476 --> 00:21:13,576
This roasted duck is different from the one in China.

607
00:21:14,476 --> 00:21:16,510
You know the famous tourist spots in Ubud.

608
00:21:16,510 --> 00:21:18,876
The temple and the palace.

609
00:21:18,876 --> 00:21:20,143
Monkey Forest.

610
00:21:20,143 --> 00:21:22,043
You can walk there.

611
00:21:23,343 --> 00:21:25,976
(Park Jiyoon's 10,000 Likes Photo Spots)

612
00:21:25,976 --> 00:21:27,010
Roasted ducks sound delicious.

613
00:21:32,943 --> 00:21:34,143
Is this the restaurant?

614
00:21:34,143 --> 00:21:36,376
- Yeah, it's here. / - He even gets the door for her.

615
00:21:36,376 --> 00:21:38,143
- I know. / - Such a gentleman.

616
00:21:38,710 --> 00:21:42,043
We're only talking about how good the husband is.

617
00:21:42,043 --> 00:21:43,110
- Really? / - He's so good.

618
00:21:43,110 --> 00:21:44,443
- That's what we've been saying. / - He's a one-of-a-kind.

619
00:21:44,443 --> 00:21:46,143
- Anything good about me? / - So good.

620
00:21:46,143 --> 00:21:47,143
- Excuse me? / - Anything good about me?

621
00:21:47,143 --> 00:21:47,976
You're the worst.

622
00:21:48,743 --> 00:21:49,643
Why?

623
00:21:52,243 --> 00:21:55,143
I think we can feel everything in Bali here.

624
00:21:56,076 --> 00:21:58,243
We can see the lotus flowers and the trees.

625
00:21:58,243 --> 00:21:59,610
This has a very traditional vibe.

626
00:22:00,343 --> 00:22:01,143
Hi.

627
00:22:01,976 --> 00:22:03,776
Our first.

628
00:22:03,776 --> 00:22:05,576
So I don't know what to order.

629
00:22:05,576 --> 00:22:07,176
Oh, I know.

630
00:22:07,176 --> 00:22:10,343
I research what the restaurant's signature dishes are.

631
00:22:10,343 --> 00:22:12,076
What that restaurant is known for.

632
00:22:12,076 --> 00:22:13,876
When I pick a restaurant,

633
00:22:13,876 --> 00:22:16,343
I research their popular dishes

634
00:22:16,343 --> 00:22:17,543
through SNS and blogs.

635
00:22:17,543 --> 00:22:18,976
I look at reviews.

636
00:22:18,976 --> 00:22:20,843
- That's really good. / - I order the best dish.

637
00:22:20,843 --> 00:22:21,876
Makes it very easy.

638
00:22:21,876 --> 00:22:23,576
- She has the perfect menu. / - When we eat...

639
00:22:23,576 --> 00:22:25,576
I let my wife select the dishes.

640
00:22:25,576 --> 00:22:26,676
They are perfect for each other.

641
00:22:26,676 --> 00:22:28,110
Her orders always taste better than mine.

642
00:22:28,110 --> 00:22:29,543
Crispy duck?

643
00:22:29,543 --> 00:22:30,810
Have you been here before?

644
00:22:30,810 --> 00:22:33,010
And rice.

645
00:22:33,010 --> 00:22:33,776
And?

646
00:22:33,776 --> 00:22:36,143
And one draft beer.

647
00:22:36,143 --> 00:22:37,943
- She knows how to eat. / - When you order food...

648
00:22:37,943 --> 00:22:39,810
I'm the happiest.

649
00:22:39,810 --> 00:22:41,610
- Didn't I look happy? / - You do look happy.

650
00:22:42,476 --> 00:22:45,010
(Video-calling their kids while waiting for food)

651
00:22:47,610 --> 00:22:48,776
Mom.

652
00:22:48,776 --> 00:22:49,410
Ian.

653
00:22:49,410 --> 00:22:50,476
Oh, right. They have kids.

654
00:22:50,476 --> 00:22:52,110
I forgot about the kids.

655
00:22:52,110 --> 00:22:54,543
- We forgot too. / - I forgot that you had kids.

656
00:22:54,543 --> 00:22:56,543
We are in Yangpyeong.

657
00:22:56,543 --> 00:22:58,243
Are you listening to your grandma?

658
00:22:59,176 --> 00:23:02,643
Yes, but Dain isn't listening to grandma.

659
00:23:02,643 --> 00:23:05,210
- She's not? / - She's not listening to grandma?

660
00:23:05,210 --> 00:23:06,776
I should scold Dain.

661
00:23:07,443 --> 00:23:09,543
(Dain expresses that that's false accusation)

662
00:23:12,010 --> 00:23:14,410
Mom, if you miss me, come here.

663
00:23:14,410 --> 00:23:17,010
Yes, I want to go. I'll be there.

664
00:23:19,176 --> 00:23:21,576
- That must've broken your heart. / - They fought.

665
00:23:21,576 --> 00:23:23,976
- They're fine, right? / - He cried and tattled.

666
00:23:23,976 --> 00:23:25,976
I completely lost my appetite.

667
00:23:27,243 --> 00:23:29,276
Let me eat my meal after I wipe my tears away.

668
00:23:31,376 --> 00:23:32,076
This is the crispy duck.

669
00:23:34,110 --> 00:23:35,510
Good thing we ordered rice.

670
00:23:37,143 --> 00:23:38,576
- Let's take a photo of the food. / - We should.

671
00:23:40,143 --> 00:23:42,410
- Shots from above are the best. / - Here we go.

672
00:23:42,843 --> 00:23:43,776
Drone shot.

673
00:23:43,776 --> 00:23:44,543
Drone shot.

674
00:23:45,110 --> 00:23:46,976
(He films the food and his wife)

675
00:23:46,976 --> 00:23:49,310
Jiyoon is taking photos.

676
00:23:49,310 --> 00:23:50,143
My husband is taking a video.

677
00:23:50,143 --> 00:23:51,776
Welcome to Reset Tour.

678
00:23:51,776 --> 00:23:53,376
- Welcome to Bali. / - You need a proof shot.

679
00:23:57,376 --> 00:23:58,543
(Sweet)

680
00:23:59,210 --> 00:24:00,076
Don't talk to me now.

681
00:24:03,210 --> 00:24:04,576
Let's try it without the sauce.

682
00:24:05,576 --> 00:24:06,843
Just the clean flavor of duck.

683
00:24:06,843 --> 00:24:07,643
That looks good.

684
00:24:07,643 --> 00:24:08,376
That's...

685
00:24:08,376 --> 00:24:10,176
Does she offer you the good parts first?

686
00:24:10,910 --> 00:24:12,343
My wife eats all the good parts.

687
00:24:13,276 --> 00:24:14,310
That's a bit...

688
00:24:14,310 --> 00:24:15,543
You're the worst.

689
00:24:16,810 --> 00:24:18,610
- What? / - What is this? The Joseon Dynasty?

690
00:24:18,610 --> 00:24:19,976
Just eat first.

691
00:24:20,610 --> 00:24:22,110
I made sure it wasn't poisoned.

692
00:24:22,110 --> 00:24:24,310
I ate it first to make sure it wasn't poisoned.

693
00:24:24,310 --> 00:24:25,710
I shouldn't say this

694
00:24:25,710 --> 00:24:27,476
but my wife separates the bones for me.

695
00:24:28,943 --> 00:24:30,076
That's too mean.

696
00:24:33,510 --> 00:24:34,843
(I like you, duck)

697
00:24:36,110 --> 00:24:38,810
Sambal sauce is famous here.

698
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:39,910
It's the spicy sauce with

699
00:24:39,910 --> 00:24:41,176
chili peppers.

700
00:24:41,176 --> 00:24:42,743
- And the onion sauce. / - Onions.

701
00:24:42,743 --> 00:24:43,843
This one looks sweet.

702
00:24:44,776 --> 00:24:46,543
It looks like bean paste.

703
00:24:52,210 --> 00:24:53,143
This is so good.

704
00:24:53,143 --> 00:24:54,510
It's better with the sauce.

705
00:24:54,510 --> 00:24:57,643
I'll eat it with the chili pepper sauce and the rice.

706
00:25:03,643 --> 00:25:04,576
It's good.

707
00:25:06,410 --> 00:25:07,743
The third one is the onion sauce.

708
00:25:08,676 --> 00:25:09,843
Onion sauce.

709
00:25:10,810 --> 00:25:12,343
My gosh, you do love to eat.

710
00:25:14,276 --> 00:25:16,110
- You're the best. / - It looks so good.

711
00:25:19,310 --> 00:25:20,776
Try it with the rice.

712
00:25:26,043 --> 00:25:27,376
When it's really good,

713
00:25:27,376 --> 00:25:28,843
she has this unique expression

714
00:25:28,843 --> 00:25:30,210
while chewing.

715
00:25:30,210 --> 00:25:32,843
I personally call that expression, Spinning Windmill.

716
00:25:34,243 --> 00:25:36,376
She chews like a spinning windmill.

717
00:25:36,376 --> 00:25:37,210
Like this.

718
00:25:37,210 --> 00:25:38,976
She eats so well.

719
00:25:38,976 --> 00:25:40,576
I love it when people enjoy food.

720
00:25:40,576 --> 00:25:41,543
So do I.

721
00:25:41,543 --> 00:25:43,143
- You should eat well. / - On a certain show...

722
00:25:43,143 --> 00:25:44,410
- Hwang Gyoik... / - You should chomp it down.

723
00:25:44,410 --> 00:25:46,476
- Right. / - Does this when something tastes good.

724
00:25:47,043 --> 00:25:48,710
My wife does the same thing.

725
00:25:48,710 --> 00:25:49,943
That means it's really good.

726
00:25:51,443 --> 00:25:53,610
When she does those things, it means it's good.

727
00:25:54,510 --> 00:25:55,710
They are a married couple of 9 years indeed.

728
00:25:55,710 --> 00:25:56,843
You're the best eater.

729
00:25:56,843 --> 00:25:58,976
You're only eating the skin.

730
00:25:58,976 --> 00:26:00,776
- Isn't that the best part? / - It is good, yes.

731
00:26:02,410 --> 00:26:03,876
Should we check out the dish you ordered?

732
00:26:06,410 --> 00:26:08,343
Everything I do is a fail.

733
00:26:08,343 --> 00:26:09,643
It's better to follow her lead.

734
00:26:09,643 --> 00:26:11,643
Whenever he wants to try something,

735
00:26:11,643 --> 00:26:12,743
it never tastes good.

736
00:26:12,743 --> 00:26:13,943
I fail 100%.

737
00:26:14,443 --> 00:26:15,243
Those are ribs, right?

738
00:26:16,243 --> 00:26:17,910
(They are ordinary barbecue ribs)

739
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:20,010
My gosh, Dongseok...

740
00:26:20,010 --> 00:26:22,143
- He went with a safe choice. / - Right.

741
00:26:22,143 --> 00:26:23,210
You ought to eat it with your hands.

742
00:26:23,210 --> 00:26:24,243
The interesting thing

743
00:26:24,243 --> 00:26:25,810
is that only Jiyoon eats with her hands.

744
00:26:25,810 --> 00:26:27,210
Dongseok uses his fork.

745
00:26:27,210 --> 00:26:28,443
Fork and spoon.

746
00:26:28,443 --> 00:26:29,176
He's very refined.

747
00:26:29,176 --> 00:26:30,476
- He eats so quietly. / - It's good as soon as I tasted it.

748
00:26:31,376 --> 00:26:32,776
She really loves food.

749
00:26:34,610 --> 00:26:36,510
Muslims

750
00:26:36,510 --> 00:26:38,110
don't eat pork, right?

751
00:26:38,110 --> 00:26:40,343
But people in Bali believe in Hinduism.

752
00:26:41,376 --> 00:26:42,410
Seriously...

753
00:26:42,410 --> 00:26:44,210
We don't feed each other food or anything like that.

754
00:26:44,210 --> 00:26:46,510
Couples who've been married for 3 months do that.

755
00:26:49,776 --> 00:26:51,876
I think newlyweds who don't eat much

756
00:26:51,876 --> 00:26:53,576
can order two dishes.

757
00:26:54,143 --> 00:26:56,076
She can't eat much because she's gotten old.

758
00:26:56,076 --> 00:26:56,910
- She's eating less? / - Yes.

759
00:26:57,810 --> 00:26:58,943
- It was incredible. / - During her peak?

760
00:26:58,943 --> 00:27:00,143
Of course.

761
00:27:00,143 --> 00:27:01,743
Before our first child was born,

762
00:27:01,743 --> 00:27:02,910
we went to a barbecue.

763
00:27:02,910 --> 00:27:04,710
The owner looked at the bill and said...

764
00:27:05,443 --> 00:27:07,110
"Something is wrong here."

765
00:27:07,843 --> 00:27:08,576
Where?

766
00:27:08,576 --> 00:27:09,843
He thought there was a mistake.

767
00:27:09,843 --> 00:27:11,510
We ate about 7 or 8 servings.

768
00:27:12,310 --> 00:27:14,076
- He couldn't believe that we did. / - Excuse me.

769
00:27:14,076 --> 00:27:15,510
You're not badmouthing her, right?

770
00:27:15,510 --> 00:27:17,010
She said her ears are burning.

771
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:18,076
Were you badmouthing her?

772
00:27:20,643 --> 00:27:22,076
Not bad.

773
00:27:22,076 --> 00:27:23,910
- It's 1:30 p.m. / - 1:30 pm.

774
00:27:23,910 --> 00:27:25,576
Since Bali is an island of deities,

775
00:27:25,576 --> 00:27:27,243
there are a lot of temples.

776
00:27:27,243 --> 00:27:28,943
I heard there's this beautiful temple.

777
00:27:28,943 --> 00:27:30,076
We can visit the temple.

778
00:27:31,176 --> 00:27:33,010
We ought to shop

779
00:27:33,010 --> 00:27:34,076
at the traditional market.

780
00:27:34,076 --> 00:27:35,076
We can buy a bag for Dain

781
00:27:35,076 --> 00:27:36,410
and traditional clothes for Ian.

782
00:27:36,876 --> 00:27:37,610
Look at his face.

783
00:27:37,610 --> 00:27:39,310
And mine.

784
00:27:39,310 --> 00:27:40,410
Just a little.

785
00:27:40,410 --> 00:27:43,276
Ubud is cheaper than other cities in the South.

786
00:27:43,276 --> 00:27:46,043
That's why we should do most of our shopping here.

787
00:27:46,043 --> 00:27:48,043
I will try hard to stop you from buying.

788
00:27:48,043 --> 00:27:49,210
Try it if you can.

789
00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:50,876
I can get 10,000 likes

790
00:27:50,876 --> 00:27:53,110
with just a photo

791
00:27:53,110 --> 00:27:54,076
in this spot.

792
00:27:58,043 --> 00:28:00,910
We were near the center of Ubud.

793
00:28:00,910 --> 00:28:03,010
From that restaurant, you can walk...

794
00:28:03,010 --> 00:28:05,743
To the famous temple and market.

795
00:28:05,743 --> 00:28:06,510
Unexpected, right?

796
00:28:06,510 --> 00:28:08,710
They're good at highlighting

797
00:28:08,710 --> 00:28:09,976
the uniqueness of Bali.

798
00:28:09,976 --> 00:28:12,543
- That's so intriguing. / - The Starbucks was famous.

799
00:28:12,543 --> 00:28:14,110
The Starbucks here

800
00:28:14,110 --> 00:28:17,310
is one of the 10 most unique Starbucks in the world.

801
00:28:17,310 --> 00:28:19,276
- The tradition... / - It feels like Bali.

802
00:28:19,276 --> 00:28:21,176
And modernity comes together.

803
00:28:22,610 --> 00:28:24,110
- They're lotus flowers. / - They're so pretty.

804
00:28:24,110 --> 00:28:25,976
We went there when the lotus flowers were blooming.

805
00:28:28,343 --> 00:28:29,876
It's the perfect time right now.

806
00:28:29,876 --> 00:28:31,576
Lotus flowers bloom in February.

807
00:28:31,576 --> 00:28:33,110
We came at the perfect time.

808
00:28:33,110 --> 00:28:34,076
They're so pretty.

809
00:28:34,076 --> 00:28:35,710
And this bridge is

810
00:28:35,710 --> 00:28:37,376
the highlight here.

811
00:28:37,376 --> 00:28:39,343
- Seriously. / - So pretty.

812
00:28:39,343 --> 00:28:40,210
Photo spot.

813
00:28:40,210 --> 00:28:42,210
- A good spot for photos. / - Photo spot.

814
00:28:42,210 --> 00:28:44,243
You only went to beautiful places.

815
00:28:44,943 --> 00:28:47,243
(They are taking photos again)

816
00:28:47,243 --> 00:28:48,376
When we stand over there,

817
00:28:48,376 --> 00:28:50,276
we can have the temple as the backdrop.

818
00:28:50,276 --> 00:28:52,243
Make sure you get the bridge...

819
00:28:52,243 --> 00:28:53,743
- And the lotus flowers. / - Hand me the camera.

820
00:28:54,510 --> 00:28:55,843
The photo looks great here.

821
00:28:55,843 --> 00:28:57,110
Does it?

822
00:28:57,110 --> 00:28:58,710
I'll do four poses.

823
00:29:05,210 --> 00:29:06,510
Are we done? How do I look?

824
00:29:06,510 --> 00:29:07,743
You're a professional.

825
00:29:07,743 --> 00:29:09,776
You could take pretty outfits because

826
00:29:09,776 --> 00:29:10,643
it was just the two of you.

827
00:29:10,643 --> 00:29:12,743
- You'd need pants with your kids. / - With kids...

828
00:29:12,743 --> 00:29:15,476
- That's right. / - Since you need to sit down.

829
00:29:15,476 --> 00:29:16,676
- That's great. / - It's beautiful.

830
00:29:16,676 --> 00:29:18,010
Please keep your feet together.

831
00:29:19,110 --> 00:29:20,610
Are you doing ballet?

832
00:29:20,610 --> 00:29:22,476
Make your feet straight.

833
00:29:23,810 --> 00:29:25,510
You look like you're 185cm tall.

834
00:29:26,276 --> 00:29:27,710
My height is 184cm.

835
00:29:31,010 --> 00:29:31,776
Right here.

836
00:29:31,776 --> 00:29:33,310
This is the second photo spot.

837
00:29:34,110 --> 00:29:35,676
Make me look like a lotus girl.

838
00:29:35,676 --> 00:29:37,110
I will cup my face.

839
00:29:37,676 --> 00:29:40,010
There are specific things that ladies

840
00:29:40,010 --> 00:29:42,210
want in their photos.

841
00:29:42,210 --> 00:29:45,943
- Background, body proportion... / - Great photographer.

842
00:29:45,943 --> 00:29:47,843
- They like the balance. / - He's really good.

843
00:29:47,843 --> 00:29:49,010
Have your husband meet with mine, so he can...

844
00:29:49,010 --> 00:29:51,176
- Teach my husband. / - He'll tutor him.

845
00:29:51,176 --> 00:29:52,176
- Right. / - Seriously.

846
00:29:52,176 --> 00:29:54,843
The moment I saw the photo, I could feel it was Bali.

847
00:29:54,843 --> 00:29:58,110
It was like the meaning of our trip was

848
00:29:58,110 --> 00:30:00,143
signified in the photo.

849
00:30:00,143 --> 00:30:02,410
I just took the photos the way she wanted.

850
00:30:02,410 --> 00:30:04,310
The photos I want to take...

851
00:30:05,476 --> 00:30:07,976
And the photos she wants are definitely different.

852
00:30:08,543 --> 00:30:12,810
(Despite their differences, they look affectionate)

853
00:30:12,810 --> 00:30:14,910
We get to take selfies because the kids aren't with us.

854
00:30:14,910 --> 00:30:17,210
Seriously, we don't have many photos of just us.

855
00:30:17,210 --> 00:30:19,076
- The kids. / - They look so affectionate.

856
00:30:20,476 --> 00:30:22,376
When I go on trips, I always take photos first.

857
00:30:22,376 --> 00:30:25,010
- The scenery there is so pretty. / - Pretty, right?

858
00:30:25,010 --> 00:30:25,876
It's amazing.

859
00:30:25,876 --> 00:30:27,376
The view itself relaxes me.

860
00:30:27,376 --> 00:30:29,810
You can relax there for a bit.

861
00:30:29,810 --> 00:30:31,110
I really should visit Bali.

862
00:30:31,110 --> 00:30:34,343
- If we continue on this road... / - So much to buy here.

863
00:30:34,343 --> 00:30:36,810
There's so much to buy.

864
00:30:36,810 --> 00:30:39,410
It's the Mangnidan-gil

865
00:30:39,410 --> 00:30:40,376
or Hongdae of Ubud.

866
00:30:40,376 --> 00:30:43,143
- It's just getting popular. / - It's rising in popularity.

867
00:30:44,376 --> 00:30:46,610
You can find everything here. Everything.

868
00:30:47,010 --> 00:30:49,110
It's like a country market...

869
00:30:49,110 --> 00:30:51,276
Women love it because it's cost-effective.

870
00:30:51,276 --> 00:30:52,643
That bag looks so pretty.

871
00:30:52,643 --> 00:30:53,676
I hate it. I hate it the most.

872
00:30:54,976 --> 00:30:56,610
She has the exact same one at home.

873
00:30:57,743 --> 00:30:59,310
That's so cute.

874
00:30:59,310 --> 00:31:00,276
Hello.

875
00:31:01,210 --> 00:31:03,910
Don't you think Dain will like this one in pink?

876
00:31:03,910 --> 00:31:06,410
Excuse me. How much is this?

877
00:31:06,410 --> 00:31:08,710
- You need to shop here. / - 300?

878
00:31:08,710 --> 00:31:10,110
Discount.

879
00:31:10,110 --> 00:31:11,210
100?

880
00:31:11,210 --> 00:31:11,910
250.

881
00:31:13,043 --> 00:31:14,810
- Oh, no, no, no. / - 200.

882
00:31:15,576 --> 00:31:16,176
How much is that?

883
00:31:16,176 --> 00:31:16,910
3? What?

884
00:31:16,910 --> 00:31:19,010
- How much is that? / - The zeros at the back...

885
00:31:19,010 --> 00:31:20,376
Just remove them.

886
00:31:20,376 --> 00:31:21,943
So the 200,000...

887
00:31:21,943 --> 00:31:22,710
20... No.

888
00:31:22,710 --> 00:31:24,376
It's 20,000.

889
00:31:24,376 --> 00:31:25,076
20,000?

890
00:31:25,076 --> 00:31:26,543
Something like this.

891
00:31:27,210 --> 00:31:30,343
(Jiyoon likes the plates made of pineapple trees)

892
00:31:30,476 --> 00:31:31,643
This is beautiful.

893
00:31:32,810 --> 00:31:33,843
How much is this?

894
00:31:34,276 --> 00:31:35,443
120.

895
00:31:35,576 --> 00:31:37,810
120?

896
00:31:38,043 --> 00:31:39,643
They do look pretty.

897
00:31:39,643 --> 00:31:40,776
How many are you going to buy?

898
00:31:42,676 --> 00:31:44,176
(She enters the store)

899
00:31:45,810 --> 00:31:46,843
It has started.

900
00:31:49,243 --> 00:31:51,943
(The wooden tray costs 250,000 rupiah)

901
00:31:52,743 --> 00:31:54,210
The soundtrack for Jason Bourne is playing.

902
00:31:56,643 --> 00:31:59,143
But you need to bargain a lot here.

903
00:31:59,743 --> 00:32:02,143
- You have to offer half the price. / - That's right.

904
00:32:02,143 --> 00:32:03,876
It's okay to go as low as 30%.

905
00:32:05,610 --> 00:32:06,476
430. 430.

906
00:32:07,043 --> 00:32:07,943
430.

907
00:32:08,643 --> 00:32:09,243
Okay, 430.

908
00:32:09,243 --> 00:32:11,843
- Do you want something else? / - No, no. 430.

909
00:32:11,843 --> 00:32:13,243
After so much bargaining,

910
00:32:13,243 --> 00:32:15,976
I forgot how much discount I got.

911
00:32:15,976 --> 00:32:16,710
Right?

912
00:32:16,710 --> 00:32:17,910
You could've given more.

913
00:32:17,910 --> 00:32:19,343
Thank you. Have a good day.

914
00:32:21,043 --> 00:32:23,376
Going from 560 to 430. Isn't it pretty good?

915
00:32:24,776 --> 00:32:25,876
When the episode airs...

916
00:32:25,876 --> 00:32:27,110
Please write on the forum.

917
00:32:27,110 --> 00:32:29,443
- The right price. / - We could be called stupid.

918
00:32:30,843 --> 00:32:33,210
Shopping here is thrilling.

919
00:32:33,210 --> 00:32:35,410
Let's not buy more plates now.

920
00:32:35,410 --> 00:32:36,243
- Plates? / - Yes.

921
00:32:36,243 --> 00:32:38,943
I'm a married woman. What could I buy if not plates?

922
00:32:38,943 --> 00:32:39,776
Huh?

923
00:32:39,776 --> 00:32:41,276
These look pretty.

924
00:32:41,276 --> 00:32:42,076
You must buy it.

925
00:32:42,076 --> 00:32:43,110
I bought it too.

926
00:32:43,110 --> 00:32:44,243
I bought that.

927
00:32:44,243 --> 00:32:46,210
Ian, Dain, you and me. It's the four of us.

928
00:32:46,210 --> 00:32:48,543
We need a set of four, what else?

929
00:32:48,543 --> 00:32:50,543
The cupboard is full of plates. Why buy that?

930
00:32:50,543 --> 00:32:51,810
I know.

931
00:32:51,810 --> 00:32:52,776
How much is this?

932
00:32:52,776 --> 00:32:54,510
350.

933
00:32:55,376 --> 00:32:57,043
200.

934
00:32:57,710 --> 00:32:59,910
- 250. / - 220.

935
00:33:01,743 --> 00:33:03,276
- 220. / - 250.

936
00:33:03,276 --> 00:33:04,410
220.

937
00:33:04,410 --> 00:33:05,243
You can buy it.

938
00:33:05,243 --> 00:33:06,676
So you just need to haggle.

939
00:33:07,210 --> 00:33:07,976
220.

940
00:33:07,976 --> 00:33:09,243
So you bought it for $16.

941
00:33:09,243 --> 00:33:11,276
- It was around that much. / - Bought for $16.

942
00:33:11,276 --> 00:33:12,510
Good price.

943
00:33:12,510 --> 00:33:13,543
Thank you very much.

944
00:33:13,543 --> 00:33:15,276
Thank you. Have a good day.

945
00:33:16,210 --> 00:33:18,710
- You haggled. / - I got around half off.

946
00:33:18,710 --> 00:33:20,210
You did but...

947
00:33:20,210 --> 00:33:22,843
But she smiled so brightly as she sold it.

948
00:33:23,943 --> 00:33:26,310
But they need to make a living too.

949
00:33:27,710 --> 00:33:29,976
Let's buy Dain and Ian's presents.

950
00:33:29,976 --> 00:33:30,910
We only bought mine.

951
00:33:31,676 --> 00:33:33,043
This one is made of wood.

952
00:33:33,043 --> 00:33:34,110
This is beautiful.

953
00:33:34,976 --> 00:33:35,976
I'm not sure.

954
00:33:36,743 --> 00:33:37,543
How does it smell?

955
00:33:38,443 --> 00:33:39,310
I don't smell anything.

956
00:33:40,043 --> 00:33:41,876
That market looks really interesting.

957
00:33:41,876 --> 00:33:43,476
- I should really visit Bali. / - I want to go there.

958
00:33:43,476 --> 00:33:45,776
- They sell handicrafts there. / - Handicrafts.

959
00:33:45,776 --> 00:33:46,910
They are really cheap.

960
00:33:46,910 --> 00:33:48,310
I want to visit Bali to shop.

961
00:33:48,310 --> 00:33:49,110
Everything there is beautiful.

962
00:33:50,876 --> 00:33:52,276
What about that one? The Avengers?

963
00:33:52,276 --> 00:33:53,476
It's cute but...

964
00:33:53,476 --> 00:33:54,143
The guitar?

965
00:33:54,143 --> 00:33:55,243
I don't think they'll like it.

966
00:33:56,176 --> 00:33:57,210
I can't understand

967
00:33:57,210 --> 00:33:58,543
their psychology.

968
00:33:59,576 --> 00:34:02,543
I understand they like those cute things...

969
00:34:03,143 --> 00:34:05,010
But will they ever use them?

970
00:34:05,010 --> 00:34:05,943
We do.

971
00:34:05,943 --> 00:34:07,510
- Of course we do. / - We use them.

972
00:34:07,510 --> 00:34:09,810
- I'm putting it to good use. / - The pineapple plate.

973
00:34:09,810 --> 00:34:11,510
What do we need to buy next?

974
00:34:11,510 --> 00:34:12,543
Next?

975
00:34:12,543 --> 00:34:15,043
No one shops according to a plan.

976
00:34:15,443 --> 00:34:16,743
(Excited, sick of it)

977
00:34:16,743 --> 00:34:17,610
(Scanning with her sharp eyes)

978
00:34:19,010 --> 00:34:20,876
It's like Bali work pants.

979
00:34:20,876 --> 00:34:23,143
Mark my words. You won't wear them in Seoul.

980
00:34:23,143 --> 00:34:24,843
This is what I think. When you travel...

981
00:34:25,710 --> 00:34:26,843
They don't cost much.

982
00:34:26,843 --> 00:34:27,843
Cheaper than Korea.

983
00:34:28,743 --> 00:34:30,876
I've never regretted it after buying.

984
00:34:30,876 --> 00:34:32,810
Why buy them?

985
00:34:32,810 --> 00:34:34,376
I won't wear them.

986
00:34:34,376 --> 00:34:36,476
I tried them on but they were for women.

987
00:34:36,476 --> 00:34:37,643
They don't even fit.

988
00:34:37,643 --> 00:34:38,810
Why did she buy them?

989
00:34:40,210 --> 00:34:42,643
She should've checked the size for me to wear them.

990
00:34:42,643 --> 00:34:44,110
I could've worn them at home, at least.

991
00:34:44,110 --> 00:34:45,410
That was stupid.

992
00:34:45,410 --> 00:34:46,776
I think we bought enough.

993
00:34:46,776 --> 00:34:48,176
There it is.

994
00:34:48,176 --> 00:34:48,943
My hands...

995
00:34:48,943 --> 00:34:50,943
My hands are already in pain.

996
00:34:53,410 --> 00:34:54,610
The blood isn't circulating.

997
00:34:55,010 --> 00:34:56,410
(Thank you for your help)

998
00:34:56,410 --> 00:34:58,243
We'll wrap up here for shopping.

999
00:34:58,943 --> 00:34:59,676
Let's end it here.

1000
00:35:00,676 --> 00:35:03,610
(Calculating the total amount)

1001
00:35:03,610 --> 00:35:05,743
(Total, $97 approximately)

1002
00:35:05,743 --> 00:35:07,576
I got so excited when I visited that market.

1003
00:35:07,576 --> 00:35:09,943
I kept buying so much...

1004
00:35:10,843 --> 00:35:12,643
And they...

1005
00:35:12,643 --> 00:35:13,710
Bows.

1006
00:35:13,710 --> 00:35:15,243
They sold bows there.

1007
00:35:15,243 --> 00:35:16,210
- Bows? / - Bows.

1008
00:35:17,010 --> 00:35:17,810
- The bows. / - Bows?

1009
00:35:17,810 --> 00:35:20,076
They were so pretty so I got a discount.

1010
00:35:20,076 --> 00:35:21,743
I bought a bow and

1011
00:35:21,743 --> 00:35:23,143
around 8 arrows.

1012
00:35:23,143 --> 00:35:24,643
- It cost around $12. / - That's cheap.

1013
00:35:24,643 --> 00:35:26,676
- That's so cheap. / - It got confiscated at the airport.

1014
00:35:26,676 --> 00:35:29,010
- Why? / - Guns, canons and bows aren't allowed.

1015
00:35:30,543 --> 00:35:31,710
Since it was a weapon.

1016
00:35:31,710 --> 00:35:34,510
In Bali, you have to visit a restaurant

1017
00:35:34,510 --> 00:35:38,043
where you can enjoy the view of the rice paddies.

1018
00:35:38,043 --> 00:35:39,510
At first, I didn't understand that.

1019
00:35:39,510 --> 00:35:40,810
He thought it meant there wouldn't be any view.

1020
00:35:40,810 --> 00:35:42,076
- Rice paddies? / - Bali is a granary.

1021
00:35:42,076 --> 00:35:43,276
- There are many rice paddies. / - Oh, right.

1022
00:35:43,276 --> 00:35:44,643
Like an ocean view...

1023
00:35:44,643 --> 00:35:46,843
- You need to see it. / - It's a rice field.

1024
00:35:46,843 --> 00:35:48,343
- That's interesting. / - We should take a photo...

1025
00:35:48,343 --> 00:35:49,876
With that as the backdrop.

1026
00:35:51,910 --> 00:35:54,043
If that's what you want, shouldn't we just go to Yeoju?

1027
00:35:56,010 --> 00:35:58,110
- That's right. / - For some reason, it's peaceful.

1028
00:35:58,110 --> 00:35:59,810
The palm trees suit the fields.

1029
00:36:02,543 --> 00:36:04,176
That was with Tim.

1030
00:36:07,743 --> 00:36:11,376
(You have to see from above to see the rice paddies)

1031
00:36:11,510 --> 00:36:12,476
That's so pretty.

1032
00:36:14,010 --> 00:36:15,476
- This is the one we went to. / - Since...

1033
00:36:15,476 --> 00:36:18,576
Wow, that's nice.

1034
00:36:18,576 --> 00:36:20,276
It seems more dramatic.

1035
00:36:20,743 --> 00:36:22,376
It's a good spot to just zone out.

1036
00:36:24,010 --> 00:36:26,210
(A place for the photo of a life time)

1037
00:36:26,210 --> 00:36:27,676
That's a popular shot.

1038
00:36:28,776 --> 00:36:31,143
You finally took that photo.

1039
00:36:31,143 --> 00:36:32,043
We're here...

1040
00:36:33,676 --> 00:36:35,243
- But it's raining. / - It's raining.

1041
00:36:37,010 --> 00:36:38,276
But it's pretty here.

1042
00:36:38,976 --> 00:36:40,510
It has a classical grace.

1043
00:36:41,176 --> 00:36:42,210
It's pretty.

1044
00:36:43,076 --> 00:36:45,010
It's my first time seeing a paddy like this in Bali.

1045
00:36:45,010 --> 00:36:45,976
Same for me.

1046
00:36:45,976 --> 00:36:49,010
- I've seen plain rice field. / - Before...

1047
00:36:49,010 --> 00:36:50,143
It looked like Gimpo.

1048
00:36:51,343 --> 00:36:53,076
Say that again. Does this look anything like Gimpo?

1049
00:36:53,076 --> 00:36:54,810
No, this is different.

1050
00:36:54,810 --> 00:36:55,843
It's worth the visit, right?

1051
00:36:57,943 --> 00:37:00,476
I'd like to go down there if it didn't rain.

1052
00:37:01,343 --> 00:37:04,043
There are a lot of cafes that overview the rice terrace.

1053
00:37:04,043 --> 00:37:05,576
- We took a break there. / - Hold on.

1054
00:37:06,676 --> 00:37:07,776
What's happening?

1055
00:37:07,776 --> 00:37:09,243
- She needs to take a photo. / - Of course.

1056
00:37:09,710 --> 00:37:10,843
That'd be hard for me.

1057
00:37:12,976 --> 00:37:14,143
The rain will get in our drinks.

1058
00:37:15,343 --> 00:37:17,710
Hashtag Ubud, view of the rice terrace.

1059
00:37:17,710 --> 00:37:18,776
You took a great photo.

1060
00:37:18,776 --> 00:37:19,576
- I did, didn't I? / - Yes.

1061
00:37:19,576 --> 00:37:21,210
The red watermelon looks so appetizing.

1062
00:37:21,210 --> 00:37:22,376
You need that kind of composition.

1063
00:37:23,310 --> 00:37:25,143
Isn't the best part about traveling

1064
00:37:25,143 --> 00:37:27,376
the unpredictability?

1065
00:37:27,376 --> 00:37:29,110
The rain wasn't part of our itinerary today.

1066
00:37:29,110 --> 00:37:30,810
Trips never go according to plan.

1067
00:37:30,810 --> 00:37:32,676
Just seeing this view makes me happy.

1068
00:37:34,076 --> 00:37:36,410
Should we watch the sunset here?

1069
00:37:36,410 --> 00:37:38,876
It's raining. How can we see the sunset?

1070
00:37:38,876 --> 00:37:40,276
- After it rains... / - In the sky...

1071
00:37:40,276 --> 00:37:41,843
I see dark clouds.

1072
00:37:41,843 --> 00:37:44,510
Clouds over there are starting to clear away.

1073
00:37:44,510 --> 00:37:46,376
Why are you so pessimistic?

1074
00:37:47,310 --> 00:37:49,043
The sun will set soon.

1075
00:37:50,143 --> 00:37:51,610
I want to go down there.

1076
00:37:53,443 --> 00:37:54,610
Would it be too muddy?

1077
00:37:55,976 --> 00:37:57,310
Your feet will get stuck.

1078
00:37:58,443 --> 00:38:03,310
(Dongseok feels lazy but his feeling is disregarded)

1079
00:38:03,443 --> 00:38:04,876
The sun is out.

1080
00:38:04,876 --> 00:38:06,743
I was right. The sun came out.

1081
00:38:07,743 --> 00:38:09,176
Excuse me. Wait for me.

1082
00:38:09,843 --> 00:38:10,676
Madam.

1083
00:38:11,743 --> 00:38:12,910
Wait for me.

1084
00:38:12,910 --> 00:38:13,810
Follow me.

1085
00:38:14,576 --> 00:38:16,210
Can't you walk in front of her for once?

1086
00:38:17,243 --> 00:38:18,110
Please.

1087
00:38:19,076 --> 00:38:20,610
I'm sort of like...

1088
00:38:20,610 --> 00:38:22,510
- A guy in the 70s. / - I should go tell this to her.

1089
00:38:24,110 --> 00:38:25,110
I'm sorry to interrupt,

1090
00:38:25,110 --> 00:38:26,943
but can your husband walk in front just once?

1091
00:38:28,876 --> 00:38:29,543
No, no.

1092
00:38:29,543 --> 00:38:32,676
My back looks pretty so he must be behind me.

1093
00:38:34,310 --> 00:38:35,343
Can you see anything down there?

1094
00:38:39,576 --> 00:38:41,743
Did we come all the way to the bottom?

1095
00:38:41,743 --> 00:38:43,376
I want this kind of photo.

1096
00:38:44,076 --> 00:38:45,476
I will stand on the edge.

1097
00:38:45,476 --> 00:38:47,476
Make sure you include the steps and me.

1098
00:38:55,943 --> 00:38:56,943
(Wobbling)

1099
00:38:58,476 --> 00:38:59,876
Oh, no.

1100
00:38:59,876 --> 00:39:01,343
(He leans back for the perfect composition)

1101
00:39:06,576 --> 00:39:07,543
I got it.

1102
00:39:08,143 --> 00:39:09,243
That looks cool.

1103
00:39:09,710 --> 00:39:12,543
You're really experienced with photos.

1104
00:39:12,543 --> 00:39:14,176
I'm like a machine.

1105
00:39:14,710 --> 00:39:16,610
- These look great. / - We're done. Let's go.

1106
00:39:18,110 --> 00:39:20,143
- Why are you so rushed? / - Let's go.

1107
00:39:21,210 --> 00:39:23,576
We can't take a prettier photo than this.

1108
00:39:23,710 --> 00:39:27,243
We went there because she wanted to.

1109
00:39:27,243 --> 00:39:29,576
But I don't think it was worth going down there.

1110
00:39:29,576 --> 00:39:31,510
After going down there...

1111
00:39:32,010 --> 00:39:34,143
I realized that it was better seeing it from the top.

1112
00:39:34,143 --> 00:39:35,310
That's a great tip.

1113
00:39:35,310 --> 00:39:38,243
It looked like Yangpyeong down there.

1114
00:39:38,243 --> 00:39:39,443
How is it...

1115
00:39:39,443 --> 00:39:40,910
- Why? / - It's different.

1116
00:39:40,910 --> 00:39:42,643
- Why take photos there? / - Isn't it so pretty?

1117
00:39:42,643 --> 00:39:43,943
We took the time to go down there.

1118
00:39:43,943 --> 00:39:46,676
But I suggest you stay up the top.

1119
00:39:46,676 --> 00:39:48,810
- I recommend you go down. / - Right?

1120
00:39:48,810 --> 00:39:50,676
- You need to go down there. / - You do.

1121
00:39:50,676 --> 00:39:52,376
You must go down.

1122
00:39:52,376 --> 00:39:54,976
I think I'm seeing your face too much today.

1123
00:39:55,776 --> 00:39:57,810
- Now... / - I'm getting tired of it now.

1124
00:39:57,810 --> 00:39:59,776
- I need a break. / - Let's take a rest.

1125
00:39:59,776 --> 00:40:02,410
Mothers would love this.

1126
00:40:02,410 --> 00:40:05,010
Saying how good a husband he is.

1127
00:40:06,976 --> 00:40:09,943
(The 2nd morning of the trip)

1128
00:40:11,076 --> 00:40:12,143
What's that?

1129
00:40:13,843 --> 00:40:15,476
(He's doing a morning foot massage for her)

1130
00:40:17,610 --> 00:40:19,810
I can't believe this. I'm so jealous.

1131
00:40:19,810 --> 00:40:20,810
What are you doing?

1132
00:40:21,376 --> 00:40:23,610
- This isn't right. / - That's so not right.

1133
00:40:25,176 --> 00:40:27,976
He's great with foot massages.

1134
00:40:27,976 --> 00:40:30,510
I find it difficult to get up in the morning.

1135
00:40:31,176 --> 00:40:33,676
- He's so awesome. / - That's so great.

1136
00:40:34,210 --> 00:40:36,943
(Foot massage full of love)

1137
00:40:37,343 --> 00:40:39,343
(Wary)

1138
00:40:39,343 --> 00:40:41,076
We have a lot to do today.

1139
00:40:41,076 --> 00:40:44,776
- But today... / - I made the plans for today.

1140
00:40:44,776 --> 00:40:45,976
I'm so anxious.

1141
00:40:45,976 --> 00:40:48,043
You've never planned anything before.

1142
00:40:48,943 --> 00:40:50,176
Have you ever?

1143
00:40:50,176 --> 00:40:52,010
My husband planned for this day.

1144
00:40:52,010 --> 00:40:53,743
I was really worried.

1145
00:40:54,276 --> 00:40:56,843
My wife usually takes care of all the planning.

1146
00:40:56,843 --> 00:41:00,543
So I have no clue what's going to happen on the trip.

1147
00:41:00,543 --> 00:41:02,510
I enjoy traveling with the family

1148
00:41:02,510 --> 00:41:03,943
but I'm anxious.

1149
00:41:03,943 --> 00:41:05,943
I don't know what's going to happen.

1150
00:41:05,943 --> 00:41:07,210
I was a little dissatisfied about that.

1151
00:41:07,210 --> 00:41:09,943
He doesn't realize how much responsibility it is.

1152
00:41:09,943 --> 00:41:12,243
I want to tell him to enjoy the present.

1153
00:41:12,243 --> 00:41:14,676
- Isn't that the charm of traveling? / - That's the charm.

1154
00:41:14,676 --> 00:41:16,743
I wish someone would plan it all for me.

1155
00:41:17,576 --> 00:41:18,176
So pretty.

1156
00:41:18,176 --> 00:41:19,776
My husband, Choi Dongseok.

1157
00:41:19,776 --> 00:41:22,043
Think of him as having no sense of identity.

1158
00:41:22,043 --> 00:41:23,876
He loads the luggage when I tell him to.

1159
00:41:23,876 --> 00:41:26,276
He's my husband and my porter.

1160
00:41:26,276 --> 00:41:27,443
Airports are always nice.

1161
00:41:27,443 --> 00:41:29,776
- Jiyoon married well. / - Gets up when I tell him.

1162
00:41:29,776 --> 00:41:31,510
Whatever I try, it fails.

1163
00:41:31,510 --> 00:41:34,410
Wait for me.

1164
00:41:34,410 --> 00:41:36,410
I'm going to try and plan the day.

1165
00:41:36,410 --> 00:41:38,043
I hope he did well.

1166
00:41:38,043 --> 00:41:39,276
A romantic couple's trip.

1167
00:41:39,276 --> 00:41:41,743
A memorable romantic couple's trip.

1168
00:41:41,743 --> 00:41:44,643
- It's hot. / - That's so hot.

1169
00:41:44,643 --> 00:41:47,310
I planned an amazing course for today.

1170
00:41:47,310 --> 00:41:49,110
(He will do anything for her)

1171
00:41:49,110 --> 00:41:50,110
(Annoyed)

1172
00:41:50,110 --> 00:41:51,476
(Annoyed)

1173
00:41:51,476 --> 00:41:52,676
I'm going insane.

1174
00:41:52,676 --> 00:41:54,510
I should've planned it!

1175
00:41:54,510 --> 00:41:56,976
My trust for you has never been so low.

1176
00:41:57,576 --> 00:41:59,476
I'm going to murder you.

1177
00:42:01,976 --> 00:42:04,210
The day begins with photos.

1178
00:42:04,210 --> 00:42:06,010
An ordinary morning in Bali.

1179
00:42:06,010 --> 00:42:08,276
You're not shooting your husband, right?

1180
00:42:08,276 --> 00:42:10,176
- You're shooting the food, right? / - Yes, the food.

1181
00:42:10,610 --> 00:42:12,076
We tell our husbands to get out of the shot.

1182
00:42:12,076 --> 00:42:13,510
To move their hands.

1183
00:42:13,510 --> 00:42:14,610
Nice picture.

1184
00:42:14,610 --> 00:42:16,010
(I need to do it right now)

1185
00:42:16,376 --> 00:42:18,643
Since we're in Bali,

1186
00:42:18,643 --> 00:42:20,743
we're going to take wedding photos.

1187
00:42:22,410 --> 00:42:24,210
- Who will? / - In Bali style.

1188
00:42:24,643 --> 00:42:25,576
(What?)

1189
00:42:25,576 --> 00:42:26,376
We are.

1190
00:42:27,043 --> 00:42:28,610
(Worried, what if she doesn't like it?)

1191
00:42:28,610 --> 00:42:30,876
He even drinks with two hands. That's so pitiful.

1192
00:42:32,243 --> 00:42:34,476
We ate nasi goreng when we first dated.

1193
00:42:36,743 --> 00:42:37,876
Our first date?

1194
00:42:38,443 --> 00:42:39,543
At Apgujeong.

1195
00:42:40,843 --> 00:42:42,343
I don't think so.

1196
00:42:42,343 --> 00:42:44,643
I remember it being Pyeongchang-dong.

1197
00:42:44,643 --> 00:42:46,410
- What's going on? / - Their memories are different.

1198
00:42:46,410 --> 00:42:48,676
What's with Apgujeong?

1199
00:42:49,543 --> 00:42:52,243
We ate paella in Pyeongchang-dong.

1200
00:42:52,243 --> 00:42:54,943
Forget your remind wedding!

1201
00:42:57,643 --> 00:42:58,676
Everyone,

1202
00:42:58,676 --> 00:43:01,643
I got scolded plenty behind the camera.

1203
00:43:03,176 --> 00:43:05,443
- I got scolded plenty. / - I feel so sorry for him.

1204
00:43:05,443 --> 00:43:07,710
That's terrible editing.

1205
00:43:07,710 --> 00:43:10,643
They're here already.

1206
00:43:10,643 --> 00:43:12,676
You keep eating. I'll go and meet them.

1207
00:43:12,676 --> 00:43:14,510
- I'm worried. / - Don't worry.

1208
00:43:14,510 --> 00:43:16,176
- I'm worried. / - A wedding company came?

1209
00:43:16,176 --> 00:43:18,576
My husband planned a remind wedding.

1210
00:43:18,576 --> 00:43:20,176
It was a Bali style wedding.

1211
00:43:23,976 --> 00:43:26,143
There are a lot of shiny things.

1212
00:43:28,010 --> 00:43:30,476
- Forget your remind wedding! / - Bali style...

1213
00:43:31,410 --> 00:43:33,243
He even chose the outfits.

1214
00:43:33,243 --> 00:43:34,210
I had no idea.

1215
00:43:34,210 --> 00:43:35,410
Outfits are important to women.

1216
00:43:35,410 --> 00:43:38,576
I wanted to plan a romantic trip

1217
00:43:38,576 --> 00:43:43,543
that could capture a woman's heart.

1218
00:43:43,543 --> 00:43:45,376
I planned it

1219
00:43:45,376 --> 00:43:47,610
but I was so anxious on the day.

1220
00:43:48,710 --> 00:43:50,176
I was worried that she might get mad.

1221
00:43:50,876 --> 00:43:53,376
And she might not like it.

1222
00:43:54,043 --> 00:43:56,676
(The first thing he prepared is remind wedding photos)

1223
00:43:56,676 --> 00:43:58,510
It will become good memories later.

1224
00:43:58,510 --> 00:44:01,176
It'll be great for when you're feeling down.

1225
00:44:01,176 --> 00:44:03,376
- Being reminded of that time. / - It so doesn't suit you.

1226
00:44:03,376 --> 00:44:04,743
It's really funny.

1227
00:44:07,110 --> 00:44:08,143
He even got makeup done.

1228
00:44:09,910 --> 00:44:11,976
Is that an actual Bali traditional outfit?

1229
00:44:13,243 --> 00:44:15,710
(Dongseok can't take his eyes off Jiyoon)

1230
00:44:15,710 --> 00:44:16,943
(You look so pretty to me)

1231
00:44:16,943 --> 00:44:18,810
It really suits you.

1232
00:44:18,810 --> 00:44:20,610
He must have fallen in love with you again.

1233
00:44:20,610 --> 00:44:23,576
No, he kept saying that in case I didn't like it.

1234
00:44:23,576 --> 00:44:26,010
- He's being wary. / - What?

1235
00:44:26,010 --> 00:44:27,510
He's being wary.

1236
00:44:27,943 --> 00:44:30,176
(Jiyoon is in pain because the staff is nervous)

1237
00:44:30,176 --> 00:44:31,643
- You okay? / - Okay.

1238
00:44:32,443 --> 00:44:35,743
They put thousands of pins in my hair.

1239
00:44:35,743 --> 00:44:38,976
I think it was also their first time doing this.

1240
00:44:40,243 --> 00:44:42,476
I don't know why I'm so restless.

1241
00:44:42,476 --> 00:44:45,476
Did you prepare this because you want to fight me?

1242
00:44:46,276 --> 00:44:48,910
(So wary)

1243
00:44:49,410 --> 00:44:53,743
You're so pretty no matter what you wear.

1244
00:44:53,743 --> 00:44:54,876
I love those compliments.

1245
00:44:54,876 --> 00:44:56,376
You think that will forgive you?

1246
00:44:57,243 --> 00:44:59,243
I'm worried this is getting out of hand.

1247
00:45:00,010 --> 00:45:01,343
I apologize.

1248
00:45:02,110 --> 00:45:05,976
(Jiyoon is almost done)

1249
00:45:05,976 --> 00:45:08,176
Your hair must have been really heavy.

1250
00:45:08,176 --> 00:45:10,210
They put on a really big wig.

1251
00:45:10,210 --> 00:45:11,610
Doesn't this look good on me?

1252
00:45:11,610 --> 00:45:13,810
It really does look good on her.

1253
00:45:13,810 --> 00:45:16,310
She didn't like it at first.

1254
00:45:16,310 --> 00:45:18,143
But she started to like it

1255
00:45:18,143 --> 00:45:19,843
while she was being dressed up.

1256
00:45:19,843 --> 00:45:23,376
After I was dressed up, I looked like a native.

1257
00:45:23,376 --> 00:45:25,743
- A native? / - It really suited me.

1258
00:45:25,743 --> 00:45:27,643
You're like a Bali princess.

1259
00:45:27,643 --> 00:45:30,710
The people at the resort are staring at me.

1260
00:45:31,710 --> 00:45:34,643
Everyone at the resort...

1261
00:45:34,643 --> 00:45:35,743
Taking photos.

1262
00:45:35,743 --> 00:45:37,410
They thought I was putting on a show.

1263
00:45:37,410 --> 00:45:39,276
- You know the people you take photos with? / - Yes.

1264
00:45:39,276 --> 00:45:40,876
With traditional outfits.

1265
00:45:43,443 --> 00:45:44,776
I'm embarrassed.

1266
00:45:45,943 --> 00:45:47,543
It's a temple here.

1267
00:45:48,410 --> 00:45:50,943
They even provide a photographer.

1268
00:45:50,943 --> 00:45:53,776
- It's a photographer. / - He's a real pro.

1269
00:45:54,110 --> 00:45:56,710
I've never been so popular.

1270
00:45:56,710 --> 00:45:59,143
Even a Hollywood star wouldn't be so popular.

1271
00:45:59,143 --> 00:46:00,876
People are taking a lot of photos.

1272
00:46:00,876 --> 00:46:02,476
Everyone at the resort waited

1273
00:46:02,476 --> 00:46:05,610
in a line to take photos with me.

1274
00:46:08,943 --> 00:46:10,410
You're sweating, aren't you?

1275
00:46:10,410 --> 00:46:12,543
- It must be so hot. / - She's wiping his sweat away.

1276
00:46:12,543 --> 00:46:13,376
You'd sweat.

1277
00:46:14,310 --> 00:46:17,243
(Newlyweds of 9 years)

1278
00:46:18,443 --> 00:46:22,743
(They even try a Bali wedding pose)

1279
00:46:25,710 --> 00:46:29,243
Isn't this pose like an old textbook pose?

1280
00:46:29,243 --> 00:46:31,576
You're so old school.

1281
00:46:31,576 --> 00:46:33,343
(His wife is only 1 year younger than him)

1282
00:46:34,743 --> 00:46:38,010
- He even told us how to pose. / - Bali style.

1283
00:46:38,010 --> 00:46:41,010
Since we don't know what Bali weddings are like.

1284
00:46:41,010 --> 00:46:42,943
- It was different to our poses. / - Right.

1285
00:46:44,743 --> 00:46:45,876
(Thinking hard)

1286
00:46:47,343 --> 00:46:48,743
(Wary)

1287
00:46:49,876 --> 00:46:52,110
(They know each other to the core)

1288
00:46:52,110 --> 00:46:55,010
(This is what a seasoned married couple is like)

1289
00:46:56,343 --> 00:46:58,043
I feel like a techno female warrior.

1290
00:46:59,776 --> 00:47:01,076
He wants us to hold hands.

1291
00:47:01,076 --> 00:47:02,076
It really suits you.

1292
00:47:04,110 --> 00:47:06,010
Since the outfits are fancy.

1293
00:47:06,010 --> 00:47:08,310
You want photos like that.

1294
00:47:08,310 --> 00:47:09,910
Check out the water.

1295
00:47:10,910 --> 00:47:13,776
(I'll never let go of this hand)

1296
00:47:13,776 --> 00:47:15,876
(Just trust me and follow me)

1297
00:47:15,876 --> 00:47:18,110
Did you really want to do it or

1298
00:47:18,110 --> 00:47:19,576
did you want to do it for her?

1299
00:47:19,576 --> 00:47:21,076
- I wanted to do it for her. / - Right?

1300
00:47:21,076 --> 00:47:23,776
- No guy wants to take those photos. / - Of course.

1301
00:47:24,310 --> 00:47:28,176
(Dongseok wants a different photo)

1302
00:47:28,176 --> 00:47:28,876
(Recreating their wedding photo)

1303
00:47:28,876 --> 00:47:31,276
That's our wedding photo.

1304
00:47:31,910 --> 00:47:33,243
Doing the same pose.

1305
00:47:33,243 --> 00:47:38,543
(They both changed a lot as time passed)

1306
00:47:38,543 --> 00:47:40,776
(But please love each other like you always have)

1307
00:47:40,776 --> 00:47:43,310
- They were so young. / - I'm a little sad.

1308
00:47:43,310 --> 00:47:46,210
My husband hates traditional clothes the most.

1309
00:47:46,210 --> 00:47:49,243
And he hates dressing warmly

1310
00:47:49,243 --> 00:47:50,276
and sweating.

1311
00:47:50,276 --> 00:47:52,576
He even hates wearing hats.

1312
00:47:52,576 --> 00:47:55,076
But he did everything for me.

1313
00:47:55,076 --> 00:47:57,510
- He did it for his wife. / - Husbands are props.

1314
00:47:57,510 --> 00:48:00,276
It's not a wedding photo if it's focused on the guy.

1315
00:48:00,276 --> 00:48:03,510
That's only for Jung Woosung.

1316
00:48:03,510 --> 00:48:05,010
You're right about that.

1317
00:48:05,010 --> 00:48:07,843
Weddings and wedding photos are for brides.

1318
00:48:07,843 --> 00:48:11,543
- I keep falling for Dongseok. / - Me too.

1319
00:48:11,543 --> 00:48:13,976
- Right? / - I also became Dongseok's fan.

1320
00:48:13,976 --> 00:48:16,443
Should we create a fan club?

1321
00:48:16,443 --> 00:48:18,543
(Dongseok's Romantic Couple Trip)

1322
00:48:18,543 --> 00:48:20,943
(Traditional Bali cuisine)

1323
00:48:20,943 --> 00:48:24,010
You were really pretty.

1324
00:48:25,010 --> 00:48:29,510
I think Bali suits me well.

1325
00:48:30,076 --> 00:48:33,043
I thought it would be comfortable and relaxing...

1326
00:48:33,043 --> 00:48:35,076
- Since the kids aren't here. / - Yes, I thought so too.

1327
00:48:35,076 --> 00:48:37,476
I wanted to go to the spa.

1328
00:48:37,476 --> 00:48:38,876
But it's like we're in boot camp.

1329
00:48:38,876 --> 00:48:40,443
It's better with the kids.

1330
00:48:40,443 --> 00:48:42,910
I think it's better with the kids.

1331
00:48:42,910 --> 00:48:44,976
You have to take breaks if you're with kids.

1332
00:48:44,976 --> 00:48:47,743
But it was actually hard traveling like this.

1333
00:48:47,743 --> 00:48:48,476
Really?

1334
00:48:50,643 --> 00:48:52,576
(They're here to fill their stomachs after the shoot)

1335
00:48:52,576 --> 00:48:55,443
- The restaurant is really big. / - It's big.

1336
00:48:58,410 --> 00:49:00,543
Bali's babi guling.

1337
00:49:00,543 --> 00:49:02,176
- The crispy skin and moist meat? / - Yes.

1338
00:49:04,443 --> 00:49:06,076
We'll have babi guling and

1339
00:49:06,076 --> 00:49:07,543
one other dish of your choice.

1340
00:49:07,543 --> 00:49:09,776
One? Can't I order two?

1341
00:49:10,310 --> 00:49:12,976
(Back to being Jiyoon's photographer)

1342
00:49:12,976 --> 00:49:16,743
(Scanning the menus with hawk eyes)

1343
00:49:17,276 --> 00:49:19,376
(Placing a big order)

1344
00:49:19,843 --> 00:49:22,610
(After ordering the food, they start chatting)

1345
00:49:23,143 --> 00:49:25,043
Is that a new necklace?

1346
00:49:26,276 --> 00:49:29,776
Yesterday, after we had coconut ice cream...

1347
00:49:29,776 --> 00:49:33,410
- The store in front. / - That's why you took so long.

1348
00:49:34,443 --> 00:49:36,176
She must've thought he wouldn't notice.

1349
00:49:36,176 --> 00:49:37,443
I should've just said it was from home.

1350
00:49:37,443 --> 00:49:40,443
Women think men don't notice things.

1351
00:49:40,443 --> 00:49:41,776
But we do notice.

1352
00:49:41,776 --> 00:49:44,610
We know when you cut your bangs.

1353
00:49:45,276 --> 00:49:46,710
(The drinks arrive just on time)

1354
00:49:46,710 --> 00:49:48,076
The lid opens.

1355
00:49:52,476 --> 00:49:54,843
The coconut ice cream we had was really good.

1356
00:49:54,843 --> 00:49:55,910
Let's go again.

1357
00:49:56,943 --> 00:49:58,143
(They had ice cream after shopping yesterday)

1358
00:49:58,143 --> 00:49:59,510
This is so good.

1359
00:49:59,510 --> 00:50:01,110
In Ubud, there's this really good

1360
00:50:01,110 --> 00:50:03,843
coconut ice cream shop.

1361
00:50:03,843 --> 00:50:05,443
Wait a minute.

1362
00:50:06,110 --> 00:50:07,910
Give me just one sip.

1363
00:50:09,476 --> 00:50:10,676
He's so pitiful.

1364
00:50:11,976 --> 00:50:14,410
- They should just buy two. / - Seriously!

1365
00:50:14,876 --> 00:50:17,210
Want to take separate flights on the way home?

1366
00:50:17,210 --> 00:50:21,043
- Do you like coconuts? / - I love coconuts.

1367
00:50:21,043 --> 00:50:22,910
- Did you not know? / - I had no idea.

1368
00:50:22,910 --> 00:50:24,976
I've loved it my whole life.

1369
00:50:24,976 --> 00:50:26,410
What do you know about me?

1370
00:50:26,410 --> 00:50:28,543
What's my favorite ice cream?

1371
00:50:28,543 --> 00:50:28,976
Coconut ice cream.

1372
00:50:28,976 --> 00:50:31,276
I think the coconut ice cream we had was real good.

1373
00:50:31,276 --> 00:50:32,243
Let's buy one.

1374
00:50:32,243 --> 00:50:33,976
- Coconut ice cream. / - No.

1375
00:50:33,976 --> 00:50:35,843
I like vanilla ice cream.

1376
00:50:37,076 --> 00:50:38,243
You and I don't get along.

1377
00:50:38,243 --> 00:50:40,743
- You're being untrue to yourself. / - I am not.

1378
00:50:41,310 --> 00:50:42,776
(My lips are so dry)

1379
00:50:43,676 --> 00:50:46,376
I know your favorite food.

1380
00:50:46,376 --> 00:50:47,943
- What is it? / - You like sushi the best.

1381
00:50:48,310 --> 00:50:49,610
(He feels upset for some reason)

1382
00:50:49,610 --> 00:50:51,310
- I got it, didn't I? / - Yes, you did.

1383
00:50:52,343 --> 00:50:53,976
(The staff give Dongseok a chance to recover)

1384
00:50:53,976 --> 00:50:56,610
Her favorite song?

1385
00:50:57,810 --> 00:50:58,810
Song?

1386
00:50:59,910 --> 00:51:01,676
What about her favorite movie?

1387
00:51:02,310 --> 00:51:03,610
- Movie. / - Movie?

1388
00:51:03,610 --> 00:51:04,843
I don't know either.

1389
00:51:06,243 --> 00:51:08,410
This will turn into a huge fight.

1390
00:51:09,243 --> 00:51:10,410
- He has no interest in her. / - Favorite movie...

1391
00:51:10,410 --> 00:51:14,210
Oh. It's a romantic comedy.

1392
00:51:14,210 --> 00:51:16,210
She likes "Sex and the City."

1393
00:51:16,676 --> 00:51:18,210
And "Bridget Jones's Diary."

1394
00:51:19,510 --> 00:51:21,643
- I survived. / - Is he right?

1395
00:51:22,443 --> 00:51:23,776
"Notting Hill?"

1396
00:51:24,443 --> 00:51:25,776
Did he get it right?

1397
00:51:26,210 --> 00:51:27,443
It's the same writer.

1398
00:51:27,443 --> 00:51:29,810
- Goodness. / - She's being untrue to herself.

1399
00:51:29,810 --> 00:51:30,910
Did he get it?

1400
00:51:32,276 --> 00:51:34,210
(You can find out when the show airs)

1401
00:51:34,210 --> 00:51:35,743
I'm so curious.

1402
00:51:35,743 --> 00:51:38,110
It's not like he said "Mad Max."

1403
00:51:40,010 --> 00:51:41,410
(Surprised)

1404
00:51:41,410 --> 00:51:42,710
That's not ours, right?

1405
00:51:42,710 --> 00:51:44,543
- It's a whole pig. / - That's it.

1406
00:51:45,143 --> 00:51:46,376
That's how it's served?

1407
00:51:46,376 --> 00:51:47,410
That's not ours, right?

1408
00:51:47,943 --> 00:51:50,476
(They show it first, then cook it)

1409
00:51:50,476 --> 00:51:52,310
(First time having babi guling?)

1410
00:51:52,310 --> 00:51:55,443
They'll cut it in front of you, then serve it.

1411
00:51:55,443 --> 00:51:58,443
- Wow. / - They show it to you if you're curious to see.

1412
00:51:58,443 --> 00:52:01,076
- That looks so good. / - How many servings is that?

1413
00:52:01,076 --> 00:52:03,443
- It can serve 10 people. / - 10 people?

1414
00:52:03,443 --> 00:52:06,976
In Bali, they traditionally eat the whole roasted pig.

1415
00:52:06,976 --> 00:52:09,043
The skin is crispy.

1416
00:52:09,043 --> 00:52:11,743
It's crispy like chips.

1417
00:52:11,743 --> 00:52:13,110
That looks delicious.

1418
00:52:13,110 --> 00:52:14,043
There are two of them.

1419
00:52:14,876 --> 00:52:16,543
It's like chips.

1420
00:52:17,210 --> 00:52:19,576
(Crunch)

1421
00:52:19,576 --> 00:52:21,510
(Crunch)

1422
00:52:25,076 --> 00:52:26,676
It's so crispy.

1423
00:52:27,110 --> 00:52:28,876
It's kind of like pork hocks.

1424
00:52:29,676 --> 00:52:31,443
It's not gamey at all.

1425
00:52:31,443 --> 00:52:33,976
All the fat's gone too.

1426
00:52:35,743 --> 00:52:37,710
There's tender meat.

1427
00:52:37,843 --> 00:52:39,843
The meat is like boiled meat.

1428
00:52:39,843 --> 00:52:41,776
You eat so well.

1429
00:52:43,743 --> 00:52:45,843
- It's like a curry sauce. / - Isn't it good?

1430
00:52:46,343 --> 00:52:47,476
It's good.

1431
00:52:48,276 --> 00:52:51,176
It reminds me of the windmill.

1432
00:52:51,176 --> 00:52:52,710
The meat is so tender.

1433
00:52:52,710 --> 00:52:55,210
The skin is so crispy like chips.

1434
00:52:55,643 --> 00:52:57,043
Kids will love it too.

1435
00:52:57,810 --> 00:53:01,043
I'm so happy because I get to do things

1436
00:53:01,043 --> 00:53:02,843
that I couldn't do because of the kids.

1437
00:53:02,843 --> 00:53:04,476
(I agree)

1438
00:53:04,476 --> 00:53:07,210
We always cater to the kids. We go to a zoo.

1439
00:53:07,210 --> 00:53:08,076
We eat something that's not spicy.

1440
00:53:08,076 --> 00:53:09,676
Food without chili powder.

1441
00:53:09,676 --> 00:53:11,876
We can't go to a restaurant that serves spicy dishes.

1442
00:53:12,410 --> 00:53:15,610
You can't eat hot soup often.

1443
00:53:15,610 --> 00:53:19,176
Try this. This salad with hot pepper.

1444
00:53:20,543 --> 00:53:22,410
I think...

1445
00:53:22,410 --> 00:53:25,910
I'll put tender babi guling on rice...

1446
00:53:26,510 --> 00:53:30,443
And add chili sauce.

1447
00:53:34,110 --> 00:53:35,443
Maybe it's because you went on many food shows

1448
00:53:35,443 --> 00:53:36,843
but you're an expert.

1449
00:53:40,643 --> 00:53:42,810
Actually, my wife and I have different tastes.

1450
00:53:42,810 --> 00:53:44,343
When I eat...

1451
00:53:44,343 --> 00:53:47,576
I don't like adding sauce to my food.

1452
00:53:47,576 --> 00:53:49,110
I like the natural flavor of food.

1453
00:53:49,110 --> 00:53:51,843
But my wife loves adding a lot of sauce.

1454
00:53:51,843 --> 00:53:53,743
She loves marinated ribs.

1455
00:53:53,743 --> 00:53:57,076
She tells me to add sauce to everything.

1456
00:53:57,076 --> 00:53:58,776
But I don't like that.

1457
00:53:58,776 --> 00:54:00,943
Whether he likes it or not,

1458
00:54:00,943 --> 00:54:03,176
I want to let him know.

1459
00:54:03,176 --> 00:54:05,143
It's his choice.

1460
00:54:05,143 --> 00:54:07,043
But I never force him

1461
00:54:07,043 --> 00:54:08,410
to eat it my way.

1462
00:54:08,410 --> 00:54:10,843
If Dongseok went there alone, he wouldn't know.

1463
00:54:10,843 --> 00:54:12,243
- Right. / - He'd just eat it how it is.

1464
00:54:12,243 --> 00:54:14,243
- But you tell him everything. / - My husband...

1465
00:54:14,243 --> 00:54:15,910
Is the type to

1466
00:54:15,910 --> 00:54:17,376
eat cup noodles in the hotel if he travels alone.

1467
00:54:17,376 --> 00:54:19,510
And never come out.

1468
00:54:19,510 --> 00:54:22,476
Try the shrimp I chose.

1469
00:54:24,276 --> 00:54:26,710
You have to eat seafood in Bali.

1470
00:54:26,710 --> 00:54:29,310
Bali is famous for seafood so I ordered some.

1471
00:54:29,310 --> 00:54:30,376
- So meaty. / - Looks so delicious.

1472
00:54:32,710 --> 00:54:34,043
That looks delicious.

1473
00:54:34,543 --> 00:54:36,343
(They eat diligently for their next schedule)

1474
00:54:36,943 --> 00:54:37,943
I'm hungry.

1475
00:54:37,943 --> 00:54:38,976
- Right? / - Yes.

1476
00:54:39,743 --> 00:54:42,543
What's the best thing you had so far?

1477
00:54:42,543 --> 00:54:45,643
Everything's so good.

1478
00:54:45,943 --> 00:54:47,476
The sambal sauce.

1479
00:54:47,476 --> 00:54:50,343
Can't you just say it was the one I chose?

1480
00:54:50,343 --> 00:54:51,910
- The babi guling. / - Yes.

1481
00:54:52,376 --> 00:54:54,143
- The babi guling. / - Yes.

1482
00:54:55,343 --> 00:54:58,010
I'll have babi guling again next time.

1483
00:54:58,476 --> 00:55:00,810
Two plates of babi guling.

1484
00:55:00,810 --> 00:55:03,610
This isn't something that should be shared.

1485
00:55:03,610 --> 00:55:05,110
I'm full.

1486
00:55:05,110 --> 00:55:06,243
You're full?

1487
00:55:07,510 --> 00:55:10,343
What did you eat before you met me?

1488
00:55:10,343 --> 00:55:11,676
Did you eat at all?

1489
00:55:12,510 --> 00:55:15,010
Your waist was 27 inches when we first met.

1490
00:55:15,010 --> 00:55:16,410
You were so skinny.

1491
00:55:16,410 --> 00:55:17,810
You were too skinny.

1492
00:55:19,110 --> 00:55:22,743
After I met you, in 6 months...

1493
00:55:22,743 --> 00:55:24,643
You gained 7kg.

1494
00:55:24,643 --> 00:55:26,710
My waist became over 30 inches.

1495
00:55:27,143 --> 00:55:29,776
That's why your mom approved of me

1496
00:55:29,776 --> 00:55:31,510
without asking any questions.

1497
00:55:31,510 --> 00:55:34,910
My mom always wanted to make me gain weight.

1498
00:55:35,543 --> 00:55:39,010
You were the first woman who made it possible.

1499
00:55:39,010 --> 00:55:40,676
You need to lose weight now.

1500
00:55:41,910 --> 00:55:43,910
- When you were dating? / - Yes.

1501
00:55:43,910 --> 00:55:45,743
- Because you had to eat with her. / - Amazing.

1502
00:55:45,743 --> 00:55:47,576
My mother loved that.

1503
00:55:47,576 --> 00:55:48,710
- Because she ate well? / - Yes.

1504
00:55:48,710 --> 00:55:49,810
When couples go on a trip,

1505
00:55:49,810 --> 00:55:52,876
they usually feed each other at least once.

1506
00:55:52,876 --> 00:55:55,143
But you guys never do that. I love that.

1507
00:55:57,410 --> 00:55:59,143
- Alright. Let's go. / - Let's go.

1508
00:56:00,710 --> 00:56:02,710
Should we take a photo?

1509
00:56:09,843 --> 00:56:11,043
We finished everything.

1510
00:56:13,876 --> 00:56:15,576
We ate our fill so

1511
00:56:15,576 --> 00:56:17,043
now we'll head to the beach for yoga.

1512
00:56:17,043 --> 00:56:18,276
Where does he upload all that?

1513
00:56:18,276 --> 00:56:21,043
- Social media? / - He saves it for himself.

1514
00:56:21,043 --> 00:56:22,476
For his personal collection?

1515
00:56:22,476 --> 00:56:24,843
He loves watching it alone.

1516
00:56:24,843 --> 00:56:26,876
(They're planning their trip)

1517
00:56:26,876 --> 00:56:29,243
I want to try yoga.

1518
00:56:29,243 --> 00:56:30,343
(Right?)

1519
00:56:30,343 --> 00:56:32,710
There's a famous yoga center in Bali.

1520
00:56:33,810 --> 00:56:37,543
(It's a place where you can relax)

1521
00:56:37,543 --> 00:56:39,710
I think this is really nice.

1522
00:56:39,710 --> 00:56:41,910
I wanted to enjoy the relaxation

1523
00:56:41,910 --> 00:56:44,710
and yoga in Bali.

1524
00:56:44,710 --> 00:56:46,843
I couldn't try it before because of the kids.

1525
00:56:46,843 --> 00:56:48,876
- Didn't it get famous because of the movie? / - Right.

1526
00:56:48,876 --> 00:56:51,743
- "Eat Pray Love." / - And yoga.

1527
00:56:51,743 --> 00:56:54,776
- For Jiyoon, it's eat, eat... / - And eat some more.

1528
00:56:56,010 --> 00:56:58,443
My wife loves yoga.

1529
00:56:58,443 --> 00:57:01,443
On a nice beach,

1530
00:57:01,443 --> 00:57:04,676
under the hot sun, with the ocean as the backdrop...

1531
00:57:04,676 --> 00:57:06,776
That's what I imagined.

1532
00:57:06,776 --> 00:57:13,043
(Was beach yoga successful?)

1533
00:57:13,043 --> 00:57:14,610
Why did I sign up for this?

1534
00:57:14,610 --> 00:57:15,910
Is it just for the two of you?

1535
00:57:16,610 --> 00:57:19,576
I thought it'd be peaceful yoga.

1536
00:57:19,576 --> 00:57:21,143
That's what I pictured

1537
00:57:21,143 --> 00:57:24,010
but what we did was quite advanced.

1538
00:57:24,976 --> 00:57:29,843
(12-minute drive from restaurant to beach)

1539
00:57:30,776 --> 00:57:33,676
(A picturesque ocean unfolds)

1540
00:57:34,443 --> 00:57:38,210
(You can do yoga while enjoying nature)

1541
00:57:39,643 --> 00:57:42,043
(Seminyak Beach)

1542
00:57:42,376 --> 00:57:44,943
- I feel like I can do yoga well here. / - I think so too.

1543
00:57:46,176 --> 00:57:48,110
Hello.

1544
00:57:48,110 --> 00:57:49,743
It's $31 for two people.

1545
00:57:49,743 --> 00:57:51,743
Did you two prepare that?

1546
00:57:51,743 --> 00:57:53,176
Or is there a program?

1547
00:57:53,176 --> 00:57:55,976
Each hotel has a yoga program.

1548
00:57:55,976 --> 00:57:58,643
And this is a famous place.

1549
00:57:59,076 --> 00:58:01,476
(They stretch before they start)

1550
00:58:01,476 --> 00:58:04,176
Aren't seated yoga poses easy?

1551
00:58:04,176 --> 00:58:06,476
That's what you think.

1552
00:58:06,943 --> 00:58:08,343
(That looks easy)

1553
00:58:09,976 --> 00:58:14,810
(Put your hands together and raise above your head)

1554
00:58:15,743 --> 00:58:17,676
(This is easy)

1555
00:58:19,243 --> 00:58:21,376
(However)

1556
00:58:21,376 --> 00:58:24,176
(Starting to grunt)

1557
00:58:25,210 --> 00:58:28,410
Can you feel the burn?

1558
00:58:28,410 --> 00:58:29,310
I'm basically a log.

1559
00:58:29,310 --> 00:58:31,310
I'm totally stiff.

1560
00:58:33,776 --> 00:58:39,210
(This is meant to be romantic yoga)

1561
00:58:40,243 --> 00:58:41,810
(Fascinated)

1562
00:58:41,810 --> 00:58:43,643
We must've looked interesting.

1563
00:58:43,643 --> 00:58:44,643
Tourists took our picture.

1564
00:58:44,643 --> 00:58:46,610
You get your photos taken everywhere.

1565
00:58:48,276 --> 00:58:50,043
(Just then)

1566
00:58:50,043 --> 00:58:52,610
- It's raining. / - It's suddenly raining.

1567
00:58:55,310 --> 00:58:56,743
What should we do?

1568
00:58:57,610 --> 00:58:59,810
Everything I do is a fail.

1569
00:59:00,810 --> 00:59:02,443
- It's raining a lot. / - It rained a lot.

1570
00:59:02,443 --> 00:59:05,343
I thought it was fail.

1571
00:59:05,343 --> 00:59:07,476
If it rains and time gets delayed...

1572
00:59:07,476 --> 00:59:09,010
What's the most important schedule?

1573
00:59:09,010 --> 00:59:10,743
It's watching the sunset.

1574
00:59:10,743 --> 00:59:15,510
If we miss that, the trip doesn't end on a good note.

1575
00:59:15,876 --> 00:59:18,010
So I was really anxious.

1576
00:59:18,676 --> 00:59:21,443
(The rain stopped as if it understood Dongseok)

1577
00:59:22,143 --> 00:59:26,776
I was so hot so I made it rain.

1578
00:59:27,310 --> 00:59:28,476
Amazingly, the rain stopped.

1579
00:59:28,476 --> 00:59:30,876
Even my dad born in 1937 doesn't make those jokes.

1580
00:59:31,943 --> 00:59:33,376
- He's a great guy but tells lame jokes. / - Amazingly...

1581
00:59:33,376 --> 00:59:35,410
The rain stopped when you said it would.

1582
00:59:35,410 --> 00:59:37,010
I told you it'd stop at 4 p.m.

1583
00:59:37,010 --> 00:59:39,610
Are you a weather fairy or weather monster?

1584
00:59:40,710 --> 00:59:43,643
- It's nice because it's cool now. / - It is.

1585
00:59:44,010 --> 00:59:45,476
The waves are amazing.

1586
00:59:45,610 --> 00:59:47,910
(The sky is clear too)

1587
00:59:49,543 --> 00:59:50,876
I'll go below.

1588
00:59:51,310 --> 00:59:53,410
- I'm nervous. / - That's really painful.

1589
00:59:55,110 --> 00:59:56,810
(The instructors raise both feet)

1590
00:59:57,210 --> 00:59:58,776
(Argh)

1591
00:59:59,243 --> 01:00:00,410
(Smile)

1592
01:00:01,810 --> 01:00:04,510
(Smile)

1593
01:00:04,510 --> 01:00:05,676
Smile.

1594
01:00:08,043 --> 01:00:10,743
Jiyoon's skilled at yoga.

1595
01:00:10,743 --> 01:00:13,310
- She's really flexible. / - She really is.

1596
01:00:14,743 --> 01:00:17,576
Isn't it great to do that together?

1597
01:00:17,576 --> 01:00:18,943
Not the moves you practice

1598
01:00:18,943 --> 01:00:21,176
but the ones you do together are fun.

1599
01:00:22,443 --> 01:00:24,710
I don't think I've ever touched soles with my husband.

1600
01:00:24,710 --> 01:00:26,443
Was it awkward when you kissed

1601
01:00:26,443 --> 01:00:28,010
or when you touched soles?

1602
01:00:28,010 --> 01:00:31,076
I felt nervous when our soles touched.

1603
01:00:36,043 --> 01:00:38,776
He's so cool the way he makes an effort for his wife.

1604
01:00:39,510 --> 01:00:41,176
Come down.

1605
01:00:41,176 --> 01:00:43,843
- He's so stiff. / - Come down.

1606
01:00:45,343 --> 01:00:47,143
Goodness.

1607
01:00:47,743 --> 01:00:49,376
Why did I sign up for this?

1608
01:00:51,410 --> 01:00:53,410
You must not work out much.

1609
01:00:53,410 --> 01:00:55,543
I'm no good at stretching.

1610
01:00:56,643 --> 01:00:59,843
(They need to be stuck to one another for this pose)

1611
01:01:01,476 --> 01:01:03,810
That pose feels really good.

1612
01:01:05,710 --> 01:01:07,676
This is a great program.

1613
01:01:09,143 --> 01:01:10,310
Look at their faces.

1614
01:01:12,043 --> 01:01:15,410
(Their love grows as the yoga session continues)

1615
01:01:15,710 --> 01:01:17,176
Look at your partner.

1616
01:01:17,176 --> 01:01:18,776
You must do that pose.

1617
01:01:18,776 --> 01:01:20,943
(Jiyoon and Dongseok gaze at each other)

1618
01:01:20,943 --> 01:01:22,476
Excuse me, please look at me.

1619
01:01:23,910 --> 01:01:26,043
You're supposed to look at me.

1620
01:01:26,643 --> 01:01:29,510
- If I do, I will lose my balance. / - The instructor said to.

1621
01:01:30,310 --> 01:01:32,343
(They try again)

1622
01:01:32,343 --> 01:01:34,310
Look. Look at me.

1623
01:01:35,143 --> 01:01:37,176
Looking at you is the hardest.

1624
01:01:37,743 --> 01:01:39,610
Looking at you is the hardest.

1625
01:01:43,210 --> 01:01:45,843
Do you want another partner?

1626
01:01:46,576 --> 01:01:47,876
- No... / - You keep glaring at me.

1627
01:01:47,876 --> 01:01:49,043
No.

1628
01:01:49,043 --> 01:01:50,776
I'll fall if I turn my head.

1629
01:01:50,776 --> 01:01:52,610
I lose my balance because it's too funny.

1630
01:01:52,610 --> 01:01:54,376
It was so funny when we met eyes

1631
01:01:54,376 --> 01:01:56,376
so I couldn't keep my balance.

1632
01:01:56,376 --> 01:01:57,743
Such a pretty picture.

1633
01:01:58,176 --> 01:01:59,776
I love this yoga program.

1634
01:01:59,776 --> 01:02:00,543
Thank you.

1635
01:02:00,543 --> 01:02:02,543
Thank you.

1636
01:02:02,910 --> 01:02:05,676
You know that I'm not flexible at all.

1637
01:02:05,676 --> 01:02:07,610
I'm always stressed out

1638
01:02:07,610 --> 01:02:08,910
but this relaxes my muscles.

1639
01:02:09,410 --> 01:02:11,043
How did I look with the pose? Did I look good?

1640
01:02:11,643 --> 01:02:14,276
You were better than the instructor.

1641
01:02:16,443 --> 01:02:18,310
Please don't.

1642
01:02:19,543 --> 01:02:21,776
I will make a nice video of this.

1643
01:02:21,776 --> 01:02:22,310
What's wrong?

1644
01:02:22,310 --> 01:02:25,376
He's always complimenting her.

1645
01:02:26,343 --> 01:02:28,110
So great to see.

1646
01:02:31,876 --> 01:02:34,210
(I keep looking at you, you're so pretty)

1647
01:02:34,210 --> 01:02:36,510
This is the end.

1648
01:02:36,510 --> 01:02:37,643
Was it too short?

1649
01:02:38,376 --> 01:02:40,310
This is a work of art.

1650
01:02:40,810 --> 01:02:44,076
- You look great. / - I can tell he loves Jiyoon.

1651
01:02:44,076 --> 01:02:45,843
- Right? / - Yes.

1652
01:02:45,843 --> 01:02:47,876
- He could complain and whine by then. / - Yeah.

1653
01:02:47,876 --> 01:02:49,476
- And say to stop. / - Right.

1654
01:02:49,476 --> 01:02:51,776
- But he does what she wants to the end. / - So nice.

1655
01:02:51,776 --> 01:02:54,910
Let's take a couple photo to commemorate.

1656
01:02:54,910 --> 01:02:57,976
- W? / - W.

1657
01:02:58,576 --> 01:03:00,010
One side first.

1658
01:03:00,010 --> 01:03:01,443
We'll do the left side first.

1659
01:03:02,443 --> 01:03:04,043
My goodness.

1660
01:03:06,243 --> 01:03:08,043
- Don't let go of my hand. / - He's Choi-sama.

1661
01:03:08,043 --> 01:03:09,776
He does kind of look like Yon-sama.

1662
01:03:09,776 --> 01:03:11,576
They must like that.

1663
01:03:11,576 --> 01:03:13,743
- If you look at it like that... / - Smile.

1664
01:03:13,743 --> 01:03:15,310
Look at the camera and smile.

1665
01:03:17,410 --> 01:03:18,476
Smile.

1666
01:03:19,276 --> 01:03:20,910
I really want to try that.

1667
01:03:21,710 --> 01:03:23,243
- They look so good together. / - Yes.

1668
01:03:24,443 --> 01:03:25,876
Let's just break up.

1669
01:03:27,210 --> 01:03:29,176
We've come too far to break up.

1670
01:03:29,176 --> 01:03:33,010
The last thing to do is watch the sunset.

1671
01:03:33,010 --> 01:03:34,543
The sun is over there.

1672
01:03:34,543 --> 01:03:36,676
- It's really cloudy right now. / - Within an hour...

1673
01:03:36,676 --> 01:03:38,710
Or an hour and a half, the sun will go down.

1674
01:03:39,676 --> 01:03:41,843
We're going to face there when we watch the sunset.

1675
01:03:41,843 --> 01:03:42,710
That side?

1676
01:03:42,710 --> 01:03:45,043
- It's cloudy over there. / - It's clear over there.

1677
01:03:46,176 --> 01:03:47,943
- Do you not trust me? / - No.

1678
01:03:47,943 --> 01:03:50,576
Let's go over there and watch the sunset.

1679
01:03:50,576 --> 01:03:54,043
We should enjoy our last night over there.

1680
01:03:54,043 --> 01:03:56,776
I've never distrusted you this much until now.

1681
01:03:56,776 --> 01:03:59,210
They bicker but it's so nice to see.

1682
01:03:59,210 --> 01:04:02,110
- You're right. / - Let's do this as our final pose.

1683
01:04:04,410 --> 01:04:06,610
Whoever can't get up pays for dinner.

1684
01:04:06,610 --> 01:04:07,576
Reset Tour.

1685
01:04:07,576 --> 01:04:08,743
- To watch the sunset. / - Reset Tour.

1686
01:04:08,743 --> 01:04:10,743
- They seem like friends. / - Let's go!

1687
01:04:13,110 --> 01:04:15,176
Geez, Dongseok.

1688
01:04:15,176 --> 01:04:17,810
My wife's going to nag me if she sees this.

1689
01:04:17,810 --> 01:04:18,843
I'm in big trouble.

1690
01:04:18,843 --> 01:04:20,676
The husbands are in danger.

1691
01:04:21,310 --> 01:04:23,743
(Dongseok's Romantic Couple Trip)

1692
01:04:23,743 --> 01:04:24,876
(A bar with a beautiful sunset)

1693
01:04:24,876 --> 01:04:27,376
I'm a bit worried. What if you can't see the sunset?

1694
01:04:27,376 --> 01:04:29,210
It rained while we were doing yoga

1695
01:04:29,210 --> 01:04:31,276
so we were behind our schedule.

1696
01:04:31,276 --> 01:04:33,643
The sun was about to set.

1697
01:04:33,643 --> 01:04:35,576
- What is this? / - Will it be okay?

1698
01:04:35,576 --> 01:04:36,376
Look at the color of the water.

1699
01:04:36,376 --> 01:04:39,610
It's a very famous restaurant

1700
01:04:39,610 --> 01:04:41,010
where you can watch the sunset in Bali.

1701
01:04:41,010 --> 01:04:42,510
I never saw anything like this.

1702
01:04:44,676 --> 01:04:46,910
I'm sorry. This is what I'm like.

1703
01:04:46,910 --> 01:04:49,610
Why did we have to do the yoga session?

1704
01:04:49,610 --> 01:04:51,676
We didn't get to see the sunset

1705
01:04:51,676 --> 01:04:53,243
but we are healthy now.

1706
01:04:53,243 --> 01:04:56,176
I think my health is deteriorating. I don't feel good.

1707
01:04:56,176 --> 01:04:58,476
I really don't know what to say.

1708
01:05:01,043 --> 01:05:03,543
This must be it.

1709
01:05:03,543 --> 01:05:04,110
What?

1710
01:05:05,343 --> 01:05:06,543
This place is so nice.

1711
01:05:06,543 --> 01:05:08,676
It's a must-visit place for newlyweds.

1712
01:05:08,676 --> 01:05:09,943
Sunset dinner.

1713
01:05:09,943 --> 01:05:11,610
You take a gondola?

1714
01:05:11,610 --> 01:05:14,076
They built it on a cliff.

1715
01:05:14,076 --> 01:05:16,643
So you can't reach it unless you take a gondola.

1716
01:05:17,343 --> 01:05:19,043
I didn't know such a place existed in Bali.

1717
01:05:19,043 --> 01:05:20,776
I knew.

1718
01:05:21,410 --> 01:05:24,343
I read a lot about this online. I really wanted to visit.

1719
01:05:24,343 --> 01:05:26,776
- We can't come here with kids though. / - Exactly.

1720
01:05:26,776 --> 01:05:28,143
That's why I gave up on this.

1721
01:05:28,910 --> 01:05:31,176
You picked a great place.

1722
01:05:31,976 --> 01:05:34,110
(What a relief)

1723
01:05:34,110 --> 01:05:36,643
If we saw that perfect sunset...

1724
01:05:36,643 --> 01:05:40,610
- I would've been 10 out of 10. / - 10 out of 10.

1725
01:05:40,610 --> 01:05:42,410
It's not bad though, right?

1726
01:05:42,410 --> 01:05:45,210
Why do you keep asking me that?

1727
01:05:45,210 --> 01:05:47,310
- I'm nervous. / - He's like a kid.

1728
01:05:48,276 --> 01:05:49,776
The way she's grabbing his shoulder...

1729
01:05:49,776 --> 01:05:51,710
I'm expecting him to take out money and give it to her.

1730
01:05:53,776 --> 01:05:55,976
(The gondola car arrives)

1731
01:05:56,343 --> 01:05:57,943
I'm scared.

1732
01:06:00,043 --> 01:06:01,876
(Squeeze)

1733
01:06:04,576 --> 01:06:06,576
- Hey, I'm scared too. / - That looks fun.

1734
01:06:08,810 --> 01:06:10,610
We can look out.

1735
01:06:11,476 --> 01:06:14,176
- The view at night... / - It's nice.

1736
01:06:14,176 --> 01:06:15,976
The atmosphere was excellent.

1737
01:06:15,976 --> 01:06:17,410
Should we sit here?

1738
01:06:17,410 --> 01:06:21,310
(Their day is coming to an end)

1739
01:06:22,510 --> 01:06:24,476
- Was that your last night? / - Yes.

1740
01:06:24,476 --> 01:06:27,543
- How sad. / - We were sad at that moment.

1741
01:06:28,043 --> 01:06:29,676
(They don't have much time left)

1742
01:06:29,676 --> 01:06:32,676
I thought we wouldn't be able to see the ocean

1743
01:06:32,676 --> 01:06:34,176
but I can see the waves lapping.

1744
01:06:34,176 --> 01:06:36,643
Bali has its own unique charm wherever you go.

1745
01:06:36,643 --> 01:06:37,876
That's why people love going to Bali.

1746
01:06:37,876 --> 01:06:40,243
It would have been better had we gotten here earlier.

1747
01:06:40,243 --> 01:06:43,843
I'm sad that it's ending but it was a great trip.

1748
01:06:43,843 --> 01:06:45,676
If you guys arrived there earlier...

1749
01:06:45,676 --> 01:06:47,576
- You could've seen the sunset. / - Yes.

1750
01:06:47,576 --> 01:06:49,676
Take lots of photos.

1751
01:06:49,676 --> 01:06:53,543
I missed out on around 100 photos.

1752
01:06:53,543 --> 01:06:55,976
- What is that? / - What's that?

1753
01:06:56,643 --> 01:06:57,810
It's smoking.

1754
01:06:58,443 --> 01:07:00,710
They recommended this.

1755
01:07:01,443 --> 01:07:03,010
It was a fun trip.

1756
01:07:05,576 --> 01:07:09,910
Traveling with family is meaningful in its own way

1757
01:07:09,910 --> 01:07:12,443
but I think it's nice to travel just us two sometimes.

1758
01:07:12,443 --> 01:07:14,310
When we are with our kids,

1759
01:07:14,310 --> 01:07:16,476
our talks are purely functional.

1760
01:07:16,476 --> 01:07:19,243
- It's about our everyday life. / - Day-to-day life.

1761
01:07:19,243 --> 01:07:22,410
We don't have the time to think about

1762
01:07:22,410 --> 01:07:23,576
each other's feelings.

1763
01:07:23,576 --> 01:07:25,476
Spending time together like this,

1764
01:07:25,476 --> 01:07:27,976
you can read things like my facial expressions.

1765
01:07:27,976 --> 01:07:30,676
And we can check how we're doing.

1766
01:07:30,676 --> 01:07:32,510
There's no reason to fight.

1767
01:07:32,510 --> 01:07:34,910
Let's share our happiness and sadness.

1768
01:07:35,943 --> 01:07:37,376
I want to come back

1769
01:07:37,376 --> 01:07:38,376
with Ian and Dain.

1770
01:07:38,376 --> 01:07:40,710
- We probably can't come here. / - Not here.

1771
01:07:40,710 --> 01:07:43,343
- Up there somewhere. / - This could be my last.

1772
01:07:43,343 --> 01:07:45,643
- You can't go there with kids. / - Right.

1773
01:07:45,643 --> 01:07:47,476
- We'll be able to come back. / - So nice here.

1774
01:07:47,476 --> 01:07:48,743
I really want to visit there.

1775
01:07:49,810 --> 01:07:51,943
- I want to go. / - So long as the audience is surprised.

1776
01:07:52,843 --> 01:07:55,176
- What's that? / - What is that?

1777
01:07:55,576 --> 01:07:56,976
(Why is he smiling suspiciously?)

1778
01:07:58,643 --> 01:08:00,010
(We received a text after the preliminary meeting)

1779
01:08:01,543 --> 01:08:02,810
"I have a favor to ask.

1780
01:08:02,810 --> 01:08:04,610
Is there a space where we can watch a video

1781
01:08:04,610 --> 01:08:05,176
on our second night?"

1782
01:08:05,176 --> 01:08:07,010
I never got to propose to her.

1783
01:08:07,010 --> 01:08:10,476
I asked her for a final date before we got married.

1784
01:08:10,476 --> 01:08:12,876
I was going to reserve a restaurant

1785
01:08:12,876 --> 01:08:14,610
but Jiyoon got the wind of it.

1786
01:08:14,610 --> 01:08:17,576
She said that she didn't want to have dinner.

1787
01:08:17,576 --> 01:08:19,643
She said that she didn't want to go to the restaurant.

1788
01:08:19,643 --> 01:08:22,610
I had already planned everything

1789
01:08:22,610 --> 01:08:25,176
but she said she wouldn't go.

1790
01:08:25,176 --> 01:08:27,476
To comfort her,

1791
01:08:27,476 --> 01:08:28,943
I went to her house.

1792
01:08:28,943 --> 01:08:31,176
I was struggling to get the ring out.

1793
01:08:31,176 --> 01:08:34,676
I was trying to get it out

1794
01:08:34,676 --> 01:08:37,776
and my wife...

1795
01:08:37,776 --> 01:08:38,743
"Just put it on."

1796
01:08:39,376 --> 01:08:40,176
My goodness.

1797
01:08:40,843 --> 01:08:42,843
You were too mean.

1798
01:08:42,843 --> 01:08:45,543
He must've made it too obvious.

1799
01:08:46,943 --> 01:08:49,543
I'm going to make a nice video

1800
01:08:49,543 --> 01:08:50,843
to show her when I propose to her.

1801
01:08:50,843 --> 01:08:53,676
- It'll be a gift for her. / - So cool.

1802
01:08:53,676 --> 01:08:54,910
Please cheer me on.

1803
01:08:55,376 --> 01:08:57,710
That's why he wanted the video.

1804
01:08:58,176 --> 01:08:59,643
He's adorable.

1805
01:08:59,643 --> 01:09:01,643
Did you not know about the surprise?

1806
01:09:01,643 --> 01:09:04,676
That's the first time in my life I didn't catch it.

1807
01:09:04,676 --> 01:09:07,410
I was on cloud nine because of the trip.

1808
01:09:07,410 --> 01:09:08,310
I had no idea.

1809
01:09:08,310 --> 01:09:11,176
It says, "Will you marry me again?"

1810
01:09:12,076 --> 01:09:13,610
That's so romantic.

1811
01:09:13,610 --> 01:09:16,376
Why is Sia being moved by this?

1812
01:09:16,376 --> 01:09:17,710
That's so romantic.

1813
01:09:17,710 --> 01:09:19,143
There's a great seasoned thistle with rice place

1814
01:09:19,143 --> 01:09:20,543
in Pyeongchang.

1815
01:09:21,176 --> 01:09:22,776
- What's going on? / - What's this?

1816
01:09:24,043 --> 01:09:25,743
Look at him acting like he doesn't know.

1817
01:09:26,243 --> 01:09:28,310
- He's not acting. / - That's a blooper.

1818
01:09:30,010 --> 01:09:30,943
What is this?

1819
01:09:32,610 --> 01:09:34,143
- It's not like you prepared this. / - What's that?

1820
01:09:43,343 --> 01:09:44,376
That's me.

1821
01:09:45,710 --> 01:09:47,843
- She really had no idea. / - I really didn't know.

1822
01:09:47,843 --> 01:09:49,143
It was a little awkward.

1823
01:09:49,143 --> 01:09:50,376
She knows now.

1824
01:09:50,376 --> 01:09:52,410
My goodness.

1825
01:09:52,843 --> 01:09:55,576
That's why he's always shooting videos.

1826
01:09:57,610 --> 01:09:59,610
(A lot of time has passed)

1827
01:10:03,210 --> 01:10:04,943
He's really awesome.

1828
01:10:04,943 --> 01:10:06,676
I only take photos of my kids.

1829
01:10:06,676 --> 01:10:09,576
- Goodness. He added all the captions too? / - Yes.

1830
01:10:17,843 --> 01:10:20,310
(Hands are trembling)

1831
01:10:20,310 --> 01:10:21,710
Look at his hands trembling.

1832
01:10:22,943 --> 01:10:25,776
He was about to cry.

1833
01:10:29,710 --> 01:10:36,243
(He's so thankful to her for working hard for their family)

1834
01:10:44,643 --> 01:10:46,610
Did you edit this yourself?

1835
01:10:46,610 --> 01:10:48,010
It's like he's proposing for the first time.

1836
01:10:48,010 --> 01:10:50,343
You're moved by your own work.

1837
01:10:51,310 --> 01:10:53,310
That's so touching.

1838
01:10:53,310 --> 01:10:55,543
"Even in the next life..."

1839
01:10:58,543 --> 01:11:02,143
- Geez. / - "Will you marry me again?"

1840
01:11:02,543 --> 01:11:03,643
I'm going to tell my husband to do this too.

1841
01:11:03,643 --> 01:11:06,310
Will you marry me again?

1842
01:11:08,943 --> 01:11:10,143
Oh, dear.

1843
01:11:10,743 --> 01:11:11,743
Oh, dear.

1844
01:11:12,376 --> 01:11:13,876
What's going on?

1845
01:11:14,576 --> 01:11:15,510
He's so amazing.

1846
01:11:16,176 --> 01:11:18,110
Hwijae.

1847
01:11:18,110 --> 01:11:19,310
What's going on?

1848
01:11:19,310 --> 01:11:20,576
Why are you ruining the mood here?

1849
01:11:21,876 --> 01:11:23,276
What's wrong?

1850
01:11:24,476 --> 01:11:26,010
You married a great guy.

1851
01:11:28,343 --> 01:11:29,210
He's so cool.

1852
01:11:31,743 --> 01:11:34,010
- It doesn't fit. / - It's embarrassing to watch this.

1853
01:11:34,576 --> 01:11:36,243
Do you remember this?

1854
01:11:37,376 --> 01:11:39,010
This is our wedding ring.

1855
01:11:39,010 --> 01:11:40,010
Where did you find this?

1856
01:11:40,010 --> 01:11:42,476
I hid this carefully.

1857
01:11:42,476 --> 01:11:43,476
Hug me.

1858
01:11:44,310 --> 01:11:45,643
I love you.

1859
01:11:45,643 --> 01:11:46,876
- He wanted a hug. / - Who?

1860
01:11:48,710 --> 01:11:51,510
I think the marriage rate will increase

1861
01:11:51,510 --> 01:11:52,810
after people see this.

1862
01:11:52,810 --> 01:11:56,976
I'm sure that husbands like this aren't common.

1863
01:11:56,976 --> 01:11:59,210
That's so lovely.

1864
01:11:59,210 --> 01:12:02,276
I'm always thankful that

1865
01:12:02,276 --> 01:12:05,343
you're quietly being

1866
01:12:05,343 --> 01:12:07,876
a shade for me, like a tree.

1867
01:12:07,876 --> 01:12:09,843
I'm not good at expressing it.

1868
01:12:09,843 --> 01:12:12,910
But I'll do my best to

1869
01:12:12,910 --> 01:12:15,876
express it from now on.

1870
01:12:15,876 --> 01:12:17,376
Even if that doesn't work...

1871
01:12:18,110 --> 01:12:20,476
You know me better than anyone.

1872
01:12:20,476 --> 01:12:23,976
I'm sure that you will know how much I feel for you.

1873
01:12:23,976 --> 01:12:25,510
- I love you. / - They're a good couple.

1874
01:12:25,510 --> 01:12:27,076
People have their own match.

1875
01:12:27,076 --> 01:12:28,810
I'll thank you silently.

1876
01:12:30,376 --> 01:12:31,843
Why would you do it silently?

1877
01:12:31,843 --> 01:12:33,310
Why are you crying?

1878
01:12:33,943 --> 01:12:35,776
- He prepared it and he cries from it. / - No...

1879
01:12:35,776 --> 01:12:37,443
And he asks her to hug him.

1880
01:12:39,343 --> 01:12:41,210
He would disappear...

1881
01:12:41,210 --> 01:12:42,976
- In the middle of the night. / - He's crying right now.

1882
01:12:44,143 --> 01:12:44,976
- Really? / - Again?

1883
01:12:44,976 --> 01:12:47,510
- He must've felt something. / - Is he really crying?

1884
01:12:47,510 --> 01:12:49,110
Is he really crying?

1885
01:12:49,110 --> 01:12:50,010
Excuse me.

1886
01:12:50,010 --> 01:12:52,243
- What does this make of me? / - Please hug him.

1887
01:12:52,243 --> 01:12:53,210
Quick, hug him.

1888
01:12:53,210 --> 01:12:55,476
- I'm so embarrassed. / - Hurry.

1889
01:12:55,476 --> 01:12:58,010
- Hug him. / - He cried so much.

1890
01:12:58,543 --> 01:13:00,676
- Goodness. / - He cried so much.

1891
01:13:00,676 --> 01:13:02,510
- What's wrong with you? / - Goodness.

1892
01:13:03,010 --> 01:13:05,310
I'm sorry but let's not air this.

1893
01:13:06,176 --> 01:13:08,610
Let's just forget about this. This shouldn't be aired.

1894
01:13:08,610 --> 01:13:10,610
- No, this should be aired. / - A lot of men will suffer.

1895
01:13:10,610 --> 01:13:13,010
No, he's as good as Choi Sujong.

1896
01:13:13,010 --> 01:13:15,076
- Yes, he really is. / - I'm not as good as him.

1897
01:13:15,076 --> 01:13:16,410
Did you edit this?

1898
01:13:17,410 --> 01:13:18,976
You must have done it all night.

1899
01:13:18,976 --> 01:13:22,010
I had to do it when you couldn't see.

1900
01:13:22,010 --> 01:13:24,443
- Once the kids were asleep. / - I don't sleep much.

1901
01:13:24,443 --> 01:13:26,376
I was always awake.

1902
01:13:26,376 --> 01:13:29,543
I woke up at 3 or 4 a.m. to edit this.

1903
01:13:29,543 --> 01:13:32,010
I woke up and you weren't there.

1904
01:13:33,210 --> 01:13:34,810
I have a lot to do.

1905
01:13:34,810 --> 01:13:36,276
What do you do?

1906
01:13:36,276 --> 01:13:38,810
I had a lot to do before this trip.

1907
01:13:40,410 --> 01:13:42,843
(Moved)

1908
01:13:43,310 --> 01:13:44,710
I was always so sorry because

1909
01:13:44,710 --> 01:13:46,943
I didn't propose to you properly.

1910
01:13:46,943 --> 01:13:49,076
I really didn't expect it this time.

1911
01:13:49,076 --> 01:13:50,210
It was completely unexpected.

1912
01:13:50,210 --> 01:13:51,576
- Was it okay? / - Yes.

1913
01:13:53,310 --> 01:13:56,243
You succeeded today.

1914
01:13:56,243 --> 01:13:57,910
Congratulations.

1915
01:13:58,743 --> 01:14:01,576
I feel like I completed an assignment of my life.

1916
01:14:02,076 --> 01:14:04,376
I thought we didn't have

1917
01:14:04,376 --> 01:14:08,676
a true honeymoon location.

1918
01:14:08,676 --> 01:14:10,243
When people ask, "Where was your honeymoon?"

1919
01:14:10,243 --> 01:14:12,276
"What was memorable?"

1920
01:14:12,276 --> 01:14:14,043
I couldn't say anything.

1921
01:14:14,043 --> 01:14:16,510
- Now it's Bali? / - Now I can say it's Bali.

1922
01:14:18,210 --> 01:14:20,710
- Let's live happily. / - Thank you. I love you.

1923
01:14:20,710 --> 01:14:21,643
I love you.

1924
01:14:24,276 --> 01:14:32,710
(Jiyoon and Dongseok's tour was full of love)

1925
01:14:32,710 --> 01:14:34,476
That was great.

1926
01:14:36,343 --> 01:14:38,543
- Seeing Choi Dongseok cry... / - No...

1927
01:14:38,543 --> 01:14:40,643
All I did was watch our trip

1928
01:14:40,643 --> 01:14:42,143
but why do I feel like a sinner?

1929
01:14:42,143 --> 01:14:43,543
- No, no. / - No.

1930
01:14:43,543 --> 01:14:45,476
Have your tears dried up now?

1931
01:14:45,476 --> 01:14:48,843
I met Sikyung for the first time today and he goes,

1932
01:14:48,843 --> 01:14:50,110
"Why are you crying?"

1933
01:14:52,010 --> 01:14:53,243
He's way older than me.

1934
01:14:53,910 --> 01:14:57,043
As a man, I wanted to know.

1935
01:14:57,043 --> 01:14:59,476
- Why he's crying? / - The reason for his tears.

1936
01:15:00,176 --> 01:15:02,176
One thing I was a little upset about.

1937
01:15:02,176 --> 01:15:04,310
Why wouldn't she express her gratitude a little more?

1938
01:15:04,310 --> 01:15:08,276
"Honey, thank you. I loved it. I love you."

1939
01:15:08,276 --> 01:15:09,443
Can't you say that to him here?

1940
01:15:09,443 --> 01:15:10,376
I think that'd be great.

1941
01:15:10,376 --> 01:15:11,776
I was really sad when he said, "Hug me."

1942
01:15:11,776 --> 01:15:13,310
I might cry again.

1943
01:15:14,643 --> 01:15:16,610
- Do it for him. / - The "hug me..."

1944
01:15:17,410 --> 01:15:18,910
- Look into his eyes. / - Say it to him.

1945
01:15:18,910 --> 01:15:19,610
Don't look at the camera.

1946
01:15:19,610 --> 01:15:22,210
I couldn't feel it then.

1947
01:15:22,210 --> 01:15:24,210
But I reflected a lot after watching the video.

1948
01:15:24,210 --> 01:15:26,810
I complained a lot more than I thought.

1949
01:15:26,810 --> 01:15:28,943
It must've been tough for you.

1950
01:15:28,943 --> 01:15:31,043
I'm sorry that I don't

1951
01:15:31,043 --> 01:15:32,210
express myself very much.

1952
01:15:32,210 --> 01:15:34,976
You know I'm always grateful, right?

1953
01:15:34,976 --> 01:15:38,676
And I love you.

1954
01:15:38,676 --> 01:15:40,076
She said it in a whisper.

1955
01:15:42,243 --> 01:15:45,110
The viewers will know better.

1956

They're such a perfect match.

1957
01:15:47,843 --> 01:15:49,410
Those tears were beautiful.

1958
01:15:49,410 --> 01:15:50,943
We need to see the expenses.

01:15:50,943 --> 01:15:53,010
- They really did a lot. / - I'm a little worried.

1960

Excluding airfares, how much did you spend over

1962
01:15:56,743 --> 01:15:57,743

We spent around $490 then.

1968
01:16:10,743 --> 01:16:13,910
We felt that compared to the last time we went,

1969
01:16:13,910 --> 01:16:17,443
the price for food and such had risen.

1970
01:16:17,443 --> 01:16:18,910

and he wanted to do a traditional remind wedding...

1975
01:16:31,943 --> 01:16:34,076
How would you two respond?

1976
01:16:34,076 --> 01:16:35,143
Sia would do it.

1977
01:16:35,143 --> 01:16:39,076
I don't want to wear that outfit.

1978
01:16:39,710 --> 01:16:41,210
Something else.

1979
01:16:41,210 --> 01:16:43,343
I guarantee this.

1980
01:16:43,343 --> 01:16:46,376
Your husband would look great in it.

"Must he do that?"

1986
01:16:56,043 --> 01:16:57,076
"Come on."

1987
01:16:57,076 --> 01:16:59,010
- There was some tension. / - Really?

1988
01:16:59,010 --> 01:17:00,476
He will show something real.

1989
01:17:00,476 --> 01:17:01,876
I can't say anything.

1990
01:17:02,576 --> 01:17:04,076
Did you do something?

1991
01:17:04,076 --> 01:17:05,843
I think there might be something.

1992

(Next episode)

1999
01:17:18,382 --> 01:17:20,515
There's a place called Penang in Malaysia.

2000
01:17:20,949 --> 01:17:22,382
This is great.

2001
01:17:22,382 --> 01:17:24,415

It's perfect for the Korean palate.

2008
01:17:37,749 --> 01:17:39,549
I could eat these two every day.

2009
01:17:39,549 --> 01:17:40,649
It's so good.

2010
01:17:40,649 --> 01:17:42,715
It's okay because I'm with you.
