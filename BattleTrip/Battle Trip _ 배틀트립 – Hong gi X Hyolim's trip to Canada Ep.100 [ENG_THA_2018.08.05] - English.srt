00:00:01,574 --> 00:00:04,507
(Numerous great tips on trips)

2
00:00:08,641 --> 00:00:10,241
(Lee Hwijae, special guest, Lee Teuk)

3
00:00:10,707 --> 00:00:11,974
(Kim Sook, Sung Sikyung)

4
00:00:11,974 --> 00:00:13,041
Travel is war.

5
00:00:13,041 --> 00:00:15,541
Battle Trip!

6
00:00:17,274 --> 00:00:18,774
Look who's here.

7
00:00:18,774 --> 00:00:21,341
Today, we have a special host,

8
00:00:21,341 --> 00:00:22,907
Lee Teuk of Super Junior.

9
00:00:22,907 --> 00:00:24,507
Hello, I'm Lee Teuk.

10
00:00:25,107 --> 00:00:26,741
We've been waiting for you.

11
00:00:26,741 --> 00:00:29,341
I'm so excited to see you guys again.

12
00:00:29,341 --> 00:00:31,641
I was in the first episode of Battle Trip.

13
00:00:31,641 --> 00:00:33,307
- You appeared on our first episode. / - Yes.

14
00:00:33,307 --> 00:00:35,541
- The first episode was disastrous. / - It was.

15
00:00:35,541 --> 00:00:38,341
- I went on a one-day trip... / - It was a long time ago.

16
00:00:38,341 --> 00:00:40,307
With Henry.

17
00:00:40,307 --> 00:00:42,474
- And it was literally disastrous. / - It really was.

18
00:00:42,474 --> 00:00:46,274
They restored the drama set.

19
00:00:46,274 --> 00:00:48,607
There was nothing when I went there

20
00:00:48,607 --> 00:00:50,807
but it is a famous tourist attraction now.

21
00:00:50,807 --> 00:00:54,307
- You should go to Taebaek again. / - With Kyuhyun.

22
00:00:54,307 --> 00:00:56,341
I've been to Taebaek, so I'll go somewhere else.

23
00:00:56,407 --> 00:00:57,974
(Please send me somewhere else)

24
00:00:57,974 --> 00:01:00,841
- Alright then. / - And I'm glad to be here...

25
00:01:00,841 --> 00:01:03,274
- Again on the 100th episode. / - That's right.

26
00:01:03,274 --> 00:01:05,441
So this is our 100th episode.

27
00:01:05,441 --> 00:01:07,241
This is the 100th episode special.

28
00:01:07,241 --> 00:01:08,341
(Battle Trip's 100th episode)

29
00:01:08,341 --> 00:01:10,541
Thank you.

30
00:01:10,541 --> 00:01:13,107
- We should thank our viewers. / - We're very grateful.

31
00:01:13,107 --> 00:01:14,541
Thank you so much.

32
00:01:14,541 --> 00:01:16,207
So, we have the theme

33
00:01:16,207 --> 00:01:18,441
for the 100th episode of Battle Trip.

34
00:01:18,441 --> 00:01:21,307
I think people say this a lot when they're on a trip.

35
00:01:21,307 --> 00:01:22,874
- What is it? / - We mostly go on short trips.

36
00:01:22,874 --> 00:01:24,107
- Yes. It's short. / - That's right.

37
00:01:24,107 --> 00:01:26,574
We usually feel that we want to live there for a bit.

38
00:01:27,841 --> 00:01:29,374
You must've thought that at least once.

39
00:01:29,374 --> 00:01:30,474
So here's today's theme.

40
00:01:30,741 --> 00:01:32,774
It's the countries we'd want to live in.

41
00:01:33,841 --> 00:01:35,574
That sounds great.

42
00:01:35,807 --> 00:01:38,841
This is the new travel trend.

43
00:01:38,941 --> 00:01:40,807
People go on a trip to a country they'd want to live in.

44
00:01:40,874 --> 00:01:43,974
Many European tourists go to Southeast Asia

45
00:01:43,974 --> 00:01:45,774
to live there for a couple of months.

46
00:01:45,774 --> 00:01:47,274
Yeah, they do that.

47
00:01:47,274 --> 00:01:49,641
- 6 to 7 weeks. / - I was surprised to hear that.

48
00:01:49,641 --> 00:01:52,607
I couldn't believe they could take 2 months off.

49
00:01:52,607 --> 00:01:54,874
But now, it is something we can do.

50
00:01:54,874 --> 00:01:56,307
Living overseas for a month.

51
00:01:56,307 --> 00:01:58,374
- That's the trend these days. / - That sounds great.

52
00:01:59,274 --> 00:02:01,607
I'm so envious. I wonder who went on this trip?

53
00:02:01,607 --> 00:02:03,241
We should be going to these sort of trips.

54
00:02:03,241 --> 00:02:04,441
I know.

55
00:02:04,441 --> 00:02:06,341
So, today's trip designers

56
00:02:06,341 --> 00:02:07,807
went there for months?

57
00:02:07,807 --> 00:02:09,207
They just had the experience.

58
00:02:09,207 --> 00:02:10,741
- Right. / - They just experienced it.

59
00:02:10,741 --> 00:02:12,541
So, today's theme is the countries we'd want to live in.

60
00:02:12,541 --> 00:02:14,007
I wonder which countries we're going to today.

61
00:02:14,007 --> 00:02:16,107
Here come the four trip designers for today.

62
00:02:16,107 --> 00:02:19,074
(Who are the trip designers?)

63
00:02:21,441 --> 00:02:22,974
(Seulgi and Wendy of Red Velvet)

64
00:02:23,907 --> 00:02:25,607
(Seo Hyorim, Lee Honggi of FTISLAND)

65
00:02:25,607 --> 00:02:26,641
Hello.

66
00:02:26,641 --> 00:02:28,241
I know Wendy and Seulgi are good

67
00:02:28,241 --> 00:02:30,341
but Hyorim is the best.

68
00:02:30,341 --> 00:02:33,274
- She loves traveling. / - She's an expert.

69
00:02:33,274 --> 00:02:34,941
She's a travel expert.

70
00:02:34,941 --> 00:02:36,074
And she eats a lot.

71
00:02:36,074 --> 00:02:37,774
She does eat a lot.

72
00:02:37,774 --> 00:02:39,741
- I'm actually... / - Really?

73
00:02:39,741 --> 00:02:43,574
Thinking about becoming a real trip designer

74
00:02:43,574 --> 00:02:44,941
for a living.

75
00:02:44,941 --> 00:02:46,874
- What's wrong, Honggi? / - He doesn't agree.

76
00:02:46,874 --> 00:02:48,374
- I think... / - I'm just thinking.

77
00:02:48,374 --> 00:02:51,507
Some people might have the same taste as her,

78
00:02:51,507 --> 00:02:53,241
and some people don't.

79
00:02:53,241 --> 00:02:56,274
You can't do this from the beginning.

80
00:02:56,274 --> 00:02:59,107
So, what's your team name?

81
00:02:59,107 --> 00:03:00,741
It's the Realistic Sibling Tour.

82
00:03:00,741 --> 00:03:02,674
- Realistic Sibling Tour? / - Real siblings?

83
00:03:02,674 --> 00:03:04,507
- It means they fight a lot. / - Right.

84
00:03:04,507 --> 00:03:05,574
I put up with her so much.

85
00:03:05,574 --> 00:03:06,874
You did?

86
00:03:06,941 --> 00:03:08,541
I did the same thing.

87
00:03:09,174 --> 00:03:10,041
Alright then.

88
00:03:10,041 --> 00:03:12,207
Meanwhile, Seulgi and Wendy are of the same age.

89
00:03:12,207 --> 00:03:13,607
They were both born in 1994.

90
00:03:13,607 --> 00:03:14,774
- Right. / - 1994.

91
00:03:14,774 --> 00:03:16,207
We were born in 1994.

92
00:03:16,207 --> 00:03:17,941
We traveled

93
00:03:17,941 --> 00:03:20,507
with our members a few times before.

94
00:03:20,507 --> 00:03:23,307
We've always wanted to travel just us.

95
00:03:23,307 --> 00:03:25,341
But it was our first time.

96
00:03:25,341 --> 00:03:26,841
It was very fun.

97
00:03:26,841 --> 00:03:28,007
- Did you like it? / - Yes.

98
00:03:28,007 --> 00:03:28,974
Do you think you'll win?

99
00:03:29,507 --> 00:03:30,641
- We're very confident. / - I'm sure we will win.

100
00:03:30,641 --> 00:03:32,074
Besides winning or losing,

101
00:03:32,074 --> 00:03:33,441
our trip will be very fun.

102
00:03:34,007 --> 00:03:35,641
- That's it. / - That's what we need, Honggi.

103
00:03:35,641 --> 00:03:36,941
It has to be fun.

104
00:03:36,941 --> 00:03:38,207
- That's all we need. / - You'll see...

105
00:03:38,207 --> 00:03:39,607
What happens

106
00:03:39,607 --> 00:03:42,007
when a sibling goes on a trip together.

107
00:03:42,007 --> 00:03:43,474
- That's right. / - It's a real trip.

108
00:03:44,007 --> 00:03:46,274
We hit the ceiling there.

109
00:03:46,441 --> 00:03:48,841
Red Velvet is good at everything for sure,

110
00:03:48,841 --> 00:03:50,541
except for this.

111
00:03:50,541 --> 00:03:51,607
They aren't funny.

112
00:03:51,674 --> 00:03:53,341
- Oh, no. / - But...

113
00:03:53,341 --> 00:03:54,941
- That's a dangerous comment. / - That's not true.

114
00:03:54,941 --> 00:03:56,207
We had a lot of fun

115
00:03:56,207 --> 00:03:57,907
when we went on the trip.

116
00:03:58,041 --> 00:03:59,607
Since we had fun,

117
00:03:59,607 --> 00:04:00,907
the viewers will have fun watching it.

118
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:04,007
- That's right. / - How could he say that to them?

119
00:04:05,207 --> 00:04:07,207
We're going to watch these clips soon.

120
00:04:07,207 --> 00:04:09,607
I wonder which country they'd want to live in.

121
00:04:09,607 --> 00:04:11,207
- I'm curious. / - Which country did you travel to?

122
00:04:11,207 --> 00:04:13,374
It's the country I'd want to live in as

123
00:04:13,374 --> 00:04:16,841
I breathe in clean air in Mother Nature's bosom.

124
00:04:16,841 --> 00:04:18,274
Canada!

125
00:04:20,174 --> 00:04:23,074
- I hear it's a good country. / - Good choice.

126
00:04:23,074 --> 00:04:24,841
It's the country of Mother Nature

127
00:04:24,841 --> 00:04:26,107
with the Rocky Mountains.

128
00:04:26,107 --> 00:04:28,474
A country that doesn't have to worry about fine dust.

129
00:04:28,474 --> 00:04:29,807
- It's free of fine dust. / - That's true.

130
00:04:29,807 --> 00:04:31,807
Can you give us more hints?

131
00:04:31,807 --> 00:04:34,474
- Canada reminds us of maples. / - Two things.

132
00:04:34,474 --> 00:04:36,441
- Maples. / - And Niagara Falls.

133
00:04:36,441 --> 00:04:37,407
- Niagara Falls. / - Yes.

134
00:04:37,407 --> 00:04:39,007
- Over there... / - You just spoiled the entire trip.

135
00:04:39,007 --> 00:04:40,007
Really?

136
00:04:40,007 --> 00:04:41,641
- Is that it? / - Niagara Falls is great.

137
00:04:41,641 --> 00:04:43,674
- No, and the Maple Road. / - Maple...

138
00:04:43,674 --> 00:04:46,207
- Maple Road. Right. / - Maple syrup.

139
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:48,241
Canada is a great country

140
00:04:48,241 --> 00:04:49,607
but it's already been on Battle Trip.

141
00:04:49,607 --> 00:04:51,874
- But this place is a first. / - Right.

142
00:04:51,874 --> 00:04:53,741
Personally,

143
00:04:53,741 --> 00:04:55,941
I heard from people that this country is a paradise.

144
00:04:55,941 --> 00:04:57,174
I heard that too.

145
00:04:57,174 --> 00:04:59,341
- Is it Jeju-do? / - Let's find out where they went.

146
00:04:59,341 --> 00:05:01,174
- It's Ulleungdo. / - We went to the country...

147
00:05:01,174 --> 00:05:04,507
With world-class music, art, and movies.

148
00:05:04,507 --> 00:05:06,541
It's the center of culture

149
00:05:06,541 --> 00:05:08,441
and the center of Europe as well.

150
00:05:08,874 --> 00:05:10,674
We visited Austria.

151
00:05:11,341 --> 00:05:13,274
Austria! I love it.

152
00:05:13,274 --> 00:05:14,907
- I've been to Austria. / - Where?

153
00:05:14,907 --> 00:05:17,141
- How was it? / - Did you go to Hallstatt?

154
00:05:17,374 --> 00:05:19,774
- Hallstatt is wonderful. / - Hallstatt is great.

155
00:05:19,774 --> 00:05:21,507
- Have you been there? / - Of course, I have.

156
00:05:21,507 --> 00:05:23,241
To fully enjoy Vienna,

157
00:05:23,241 --> 00:05:24,474
you have to reach a certain age.

158
00:05:24,474 --> 00:05:25,874
- Good job. She's good. / - Only then, you can...

159
00:05:25,874 --> 00:05:28,741
- Understand Egon Schiele's work. / - That's right.

160
00:05:28,741 --> 00:05:31,341
- She's right. / - She knows a lot.

161
00:05:31,341 --> 00:05:32,474
She said too much.

162
00:05:32,474 --> 00:05:34,841
- It must have been really good. / - But we...

163
00:05:34,841 --> 00:05:37,174
- That's why she remembers all that. / - Right.

164
00:05:37,174 --> 00:05:39,241
- Yes, it was nice. It was indeed. / - Wendy...

165
00:05:39,241 --> 00:05:41,341
- She studied in Canada. / - Where?

166
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:43,974
- Were you born there? / - I studied in Toronto.

167
00:05:43,974 --> 00:05:46,374
- My parents live in Toronto. / - Toronto.

168
00:05:46,374 --> 00:05:47,874
Is Toronto good or bad?

169
00:05:48,807 --> 00:05:49,774
- Well... / - That's it.

170
00:05:49,774 --> 00:05:51,441
- Your question is so scary. / - It's hard.

171
00:05:51,441 --> 00:05:53,874
- She can't say it's bad. / - Toronto...

172
00:05:53,874 --> 00:05:55,674
Or Austria? Where would you want live?

173
00:05:55,674 --> 00:05:58,174
Do you know the movie, "Before Sunrise?"

174
00:05:58,174 --> 00:05:59,807
- Yes. / - I love that film.

175
00:05:59,807 --> 00:06:03,074
Austria was the setting of the movie.

176
00:06:03,074 --> 00:06:05,307
- The one with the train? / - They travel by train.

177
00:06:05,307 --> 00:06:07,341
- They spend a night. / - That made people go there.

178
00:06:07,341 --> 00:06:09,941
Thinking that they'd meet a girl like Julie Delpy.

179
00:06:09,941 --> 00:06:11,107
People get on the train expecting it

180
00:06:11,107 --> 00:06:11,907
to be like the movie.

181
00:06:11,907 --> 00:06:14,307
But the KTX is better.

182
00:06:17,174 --> 00:06:18,741
- That's not right. / - Come on.

183
00:06:18,741 --> 00:06:21,041
- People must know the truth. / - I agree.

184
00:06:21,041 --> 00:06:23,974
Did you go to Vienna just like the couple in the movie?

185
00:06:23,974 --> 00:06:27,374
Yes, and also where "The Sound of Music" was shot.

186
00:06:27,374 --> 00:06:29,374
- That's the paradise. / - Salzburg.

187
00:06:29,374 --> 00:06:31,141
- Yes, that's right. / - The mountain there is amazing.

188
00:06:31,141 --> 00:06:32,741
- It was so beautiful. / - Right.

189
00:06:32,741 --> 00:06:33,607
Since it's our 100th episode,

190
00:06:33,607 --> 00:06:34,874
they're getting very competitive.

191
00:06:34,874 --> 00:06:38,807
- They are. / - Tell us one main activity.

192
00:06:38,807 --> 00:06:42,741
As we admired Niagara Falls...

193
00:06:42,741 --> 00:06:44,541
- We rode the zip-line. / - Zip-line.

194
00:06:44,541 --> 00:06:47,841
- You ride down... / - Are the Falls under you?

195
00:06:47,841 --> 00:06:49,107
It's right next to you.

196
00:06:49,107 --> 00:06:50,941
You enjoy the view as you're on the zip-line.

197
00:06:50,941 --> 00:06:53,074
- That sounds so fun. / - Since you're so close...

198
00:06:53,074 --> 00:06:54,607
- You get splashed. / - Didn't you all get wet?

199
00:06:54,607 --> 00:06:57,241
- No, it was like a face mist. / - Natural mist.

200
00:06:57,241 --> 00:07:00,174
- To keep you moisturized. / - It's organic mist.

201
00:07:00,174 --> 00:07:02,374
Tell us an activity that will beat that from Austria.

202
00:07:02,374 --> 00:07:04,941
We got to admire the view of Salzburg

203
00:07:04,941 --> 00:07:09,074
and feel the Alps as we went paragliding.

204
00:07:09,874 --> 00:07:13,207
- We won! / - We won. What? Paragliding?

205
00:07:13,274 --> 00:07:15,941
- We did it. We won. / - We won.

206
00:07:15,941 --> 00:07:17,574
- We won this battle. / - They went paragliding?

207
00:07:17,574 --> 00:07:19,907
The battle will be cutthroat.

208
00:07:19,907 --> 00:07:21,341
No matter how much we fight over it,

209
00:07:21,341 --> 00:07:22,574
they will be the judge of it.

210
00:07:22,574 --> 00:07:23,907
We have our 100 impartial judges.

211
00:07:23,907 --> 00:07:26,507
- Nice to meet you. / - Hello.

212
00:07:26,507 --> 00:07:28,141
- We hope you like our trip. / - We hope you like it.

213
00:07:28,141 --> 00:07:31,841
- Please vote for us. / - Forget about Niagara Falls.

214
00:07:31,841 --> 00:07:34,574
- Showing one city would be boring. / - Right.

215
00:07:34,574 --> 00:07:37,841
They combined the trips for a metropolis

216
00:07:37,841 --> 00:07:39,307
and a small city.

217
00:07:39,307 --> 00:07:40,307
It won't be a single round.

218
00:07:40,307 --> 00:07:41,741
It will be a two-round battle.

219
00:07:41,741 --> 00:07:45,341
- Right. / - The team with higher total vote wins.

220
00:07:45,341 --> 00:07:46,874
- Which team should go first? / - I think...

221
00:07:46,874 --> 00:07:48,474
- Our team should go first. / - No.

222
00:07:48,474 --> 00:07:49,841
- No? / - No.

223
00:07:49,841 --> 00:07:52,607
- We should go first. / - According to my observation...

224
00:07:52,607 --> 00:07:55,674
- Teams that go first usually... / - Right.

225
00:07:55,674 --> 00:07:58,307

226
00:07:58,307 --> 00:08:00,607
- We'll let you go first. / - It's an advantage.

227
00:08:00,607 --> 00:08:02,507
- We're confident about our trip. / - Go ahead.

228
00:08:02,507 --> 00:08:05,874
She's an expert on traveling. He's her best friend.

229
00:08:05,874 --> 00:08:08,141
Let's see how realistic their trip was.

230
00:08:08,141 --> 00:08:09,841
Let's set out to Canada.

231
00:08:16,041 --> 00:08:18,874
(One of the top three waterfalls in the world)

232
00:08:20,741 --> 00:08:22,941
(Blown away by Mother Nature in Canada)

233
00:08:22,941 --> 00:08:24,574
It's like I'm being sucked in.

234
00:08:25,241 --> 00:08:26,874
It's Niagara Falls.

235
00:08:29,241 --> 00:08:31,307
I'm going to save all of this in my eyes.

236
00:08:32,241 --> 00:08:34,574
It's so great that there's no fine dust.

237
00:08:34,574 --> 00:08:36,641
- The air is so fresh here. / - Isn't it really fresh?

238
00:08:38,307 --> 00:08:39,241
It's so beautiful.

239
00:08:39,241 --> 00:08:40,974
It's so cute.

240
00:08:40,974 --> 00:08:42,274
It's like we're in Europe.

241
00:08:42,274 --> 00:08:43,674
- What's that? / - It's so pretty.

242
00:08:43,674 --> 00:08:44,674
- It was really beautiful. / - What is that?

243
00:08:44,674 --> 00:08:48,074
They're called the Thousand Islands.

244
00:08:48,107 --> 00:08:50,241
It's really beautiful.

245
00:08:50,374 --> 00:08:52,574
I might end up moving to Canada.

246

(Realistic Sibling Tour in Canada)

247
00:08:54,874 --> 00:08:55,907
What are you up to?

248
00:08:55,907 --> 00:08:57,341
- Just something... / - You're playing games again!

249
00:08:57,341 --> 00:08:59,574
Let's go! Come on.

250
00:08:59,574 --> 00:09:01,207
Let's go.

251
00:09:01,907 --> 00:09:07,374
(One afternoon before the trip)

252
00:09:07,374 --> 00:09:10,074
Hello. I'm Seo Hyorim.

253
00:09:10,074 --> 00:09:13,007
I'm happy to be on Battle Trip again.

254
00:09:13,007 --> 00:09:15,441
- She's an expert. / - It's so nice to see you again.

255
00:09:15,974 --> 00:09:19,474
I was given a chance to go on my second trip.

256
00:09:19,474 --> 00:09:22,041
I believe I'll get to enjoy this trip more

257
00:09:22,041 --> 00:09:24,574
than my first time.

258
00:09:24,574 --> 00:09:25,541
She's an expert indeed.

259
00:09:25,541 --> 00:09:26,541
She's not an easy match.

260
00:09:26,541 --> 00:09:28,441
You had so much fun in Dubai.

261
00:09:28,441 --> 00:09:29,607
Right.

262
00:09:29,607 --> 00:09:32,274
(Dubai and Italy trip on episodes 27 and 30)

263
00:09:33,507 --> 00:09:35,341
(She made an overwhelming stopover in Dubai)

264
00:09:35,341 --> 00:09:37,674
I feel like my heart will explode.

265
00:09:37,674 --> 00:09:40,374

266
00:09:40,374 --> 00:09:44,207

(She planned a stopover trip for Dubai and Italy)

268
00:09:47,707 --> 00:09:49,541
- She always drank in one go. / - Her eyes widen.

269
00:09:50,307 --> 00:09:51,574
She seems to really enjoy it.

270
00:09:52,541 --> 00:09:54,074
It's so delicious.

271
00:09:55,707 --> 00:09:59,007
Last time, I went to Positano in the Amalfi Coast.

272
00:09:59,007 --> 00:10:01,241
I really liked the region.

273
00:10:01,241 --> 00:10:04,474
A while ago, I stayed there for two weeks in March.

274
00:10:04,474 --> 00:10:06,207
- She went there again. / - It's great there.

275
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:07,907
Even though it was my second time there,

276
00:10:07,907 --> 00:10:09,274
I still had a great time.

277
00:10:09,274 --> 00:10:13,107
After that, I visited Germany too.

278
00:10:13,107 --> 00:10:15,741
I went to Paris, Japan

279
00:10:15,741 --> 00:10:17,741
and Hong Kong.

280
00:10:18,641 --> 00:10:21,307
- I kept going on trips. / - She's an expert indeed.

281
00:10:21,307 --> 00:10:22,741
It's hard to see her in Korea.

282
00:10:23,774 --> 00:10:25,507
Are you going on a trip with Lee Chunga again?

283
00:10:26,307 --> 00:10:30,274
No, this time, I can't go with her which is a shame.

284
00:10:30,274 --> 00:10:34,407
Oh, right. Chunga was really scared of going on trips

285
00:10:34,407 --> 00:10:37,407
but now, she got hooked on traveling.

286
00:10:37,407 --> 00:10:39,707
It's hard to see her in Korea now.

287
00:10:39,907 --> 00:10:41,074
So this time...

288
00:10:41,874 --> 00:10:44,674
I'll go with this friend who likes traveling

289
00:10:44,674 --> 00:10:48,541
but can't go on trips because of his busy schedule.

290
00:10:48,541 --> 00:10:49,874
My travel companion should be

291
00:10:49,874 --> 00:10:51,507
someone I'm comfortable with.

292
00:10:51,507 --> 00:10:53,241
- That's right. / - It's better that way.

293
00:10:53,241 --> 00:10:55,541
When I asked my friend to join me,

294
00:10:55,541 --> 00:10:59,741
he said yes right away, so we'll be going together.

295
00:10:59,741 --> 00:11:03,941
I'm looking forward to it but I'm extremely worried.

296
00:11:03,941 --> 00:11:05,174
I mean it.

297
00:11:05,707 --> 00:11:07,241
- Hello. / - Hello.

298
00:11:07,274 --> 00:11:10,041
- It's Honggi. / - Gosh, he's putting on an act.

299
00:11:10,074 --> 00:11:11,674
I wasn't. It wasn't part of my act.

300
00:11:11,674 --> 00:11:14,974
Let me introduce my friend. It's Lee Honggi.

301

In 2009, I was pretty young too.

307
00:11:28,141 --> 00:11:30,441
That's when I filmed the music video for their song,

308
00:11:30,441 --> 00:11:31,441
"Bad Woman."

(It's Hyorim's clip from 9 years ago)

311
00:11:37,141 --> 00:11:39,007
- You were the bad woman. / - Yes.

312
00:11:39,307 --> 00:11:39,907
Back then,

313
00:11:39,907 --> 00:11:42,307
your song was ranked 1st place for a long time.

314
00:11:42,307 --> 00:11:43,207
After the music video,

315
00:11:43,207 --> 00:11:45,241
we always sang that at karaoke.

316
00:11:45,241 --> 00:11:48,007
- We did. / - We sang a lot.

317
00:11:48,007 --> 00:11:50,007
- Right. / - So, where are we going this time?

318
00:11:50,007 --> 00:11:52,674
This time, it's about a country we'd want to live in.

319

- It's Hawaii. / - Hawaii?

- Right. Hawaii is great too. / - Exactly.

322

places that are good to live in are Austria...

324
00:12:08,907 --> 00:12:10,374
But I've been to Austria.

- Top 3 waterfall in the world. / - We read a lot about it.

350
00:13:15,274 --> 00:13:16,541
I've never seen it in person.

351
00:13:16,541 --> 00:13:19,274
- The photos look grand like this. / - But my friends...

352
00:13:19,274 --> 00:13:22,307
Told me that Niagara Falls is much prettier

353
00:13:22,307 --> 00:13:23,974
from Canada than the U.S.

354
00:13:25,207 --> 00:13:26,841
- People do say that. / - Right, I heard that too.

355
00:13:26,841 --> 00:13:28,107
- Yes, it's true. / - Seriously.

356
00:13:28,107 --> 00:13:29,541
I heard it looks different depending on your location.

357
00:13:29,541 --> 00:13:32,074
Then, we won't get to do any extreme activities?

358
00:13:33,941 --> 00:13:34,774
We will.

359
00:13:34,774 --> 00:13:38,641
- We will? Really? / - Of course. It's you and I.

360
00:13:39,074 --> 00:13:40,441
(Impressed)

361
00:13:40,874 --> 00:13:42,907
This is cheating.

362
00:13:43,907 --> 00:13:47,307
(The ultimate package of activities at Niagara Falls)

363
00:13:48,174 --> 00:13:51,274
It feels like I'm getting sucked in.

364
00:13:51,274 --> 00:13:52,441
Unbelievable.

365
00:13:52,441 --> 00:13:54,807
Oh, my God. Do you see this, everyone?

366
00:13:54,807 --> 00:13:58,974
(Niagara trip planned more special than ever)

367
00:13:58,974 --> 00:14:00,541
- You mentioned Niagara Falls. / - Right.

368
00:14:00,541 --> 00:14:02,207
- We have to go there. / - We must. We ought to.

369
00:14:02,207 --> 00:14:04,041
- We must. / - We can do many activities there.

370
00:14:04,041 --> 00:14:07,007
There are nice villages around Niagara Falls.

371
00:14:07,007 --> 00:14:09,841
- Maple Road is famous too. / - Isn't that the road?

372
00:14:09,841 --> 00:14:11,774
- What? / - Maple Road.

373
00:14:11,774 --> 00:14:13,307
I don't know much about it.

374
00:14:13,307 --> 00:14:15,674
- Sault Ste. Marie? / - Yes. That's right.

375
00:14:15,674 --> 00:14:18,441
Yes. How did you know?

376
00:14:18,441 --> 00:14:20,807
- Maple leaves. / - Yes, yes.

377
00:14:20,807 --> 00:14:22,307
It's so picturesque.

378
00:14:22,307 --> 00:14:23,307
It's like a photo from a calendar.

379
00:14:23,641 --> 00:14:25,174
- Did I get it right? / - Amazing.

380
00:14:25,174 --> 00:14:27,407
(Maple Road, Canada's famous tourist attraction)

381
00:14:28,041 --> 00:14:29,341
Gosh, look at that.

382
00:14:29,741 --> 00:14:31,941
- Stress be gone. / - Isn't this "Before Sunrise?"

383
00:14:32,174 --> 00:14:34,641
- It's a bit similar. / - You saw this in person?

384
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:36,774
- Yes. / - This is so beautiful.

385
00:14:37,274 --> 00:14:38,607
I want to leave now.

386
00:14:38,741 --> 00:14:42,341
Personally, I've been traveling a lot.

387
00:14:42,341 --> 00:14:44,841
Now, I'm really interested in visiting small cities.

388
00:14:44,841 --> 00:14:46,274
- You travel a lot. / - Right.

389
00:14:46,274 --> 00:14:48,741
Think about it. When you go on trips,

390
00:14:48,741 --> 00:14:50,641
you usually visit major cities.

391
00:14:50,641 --> 00:14:52,907
- Right. / - That's why...

392
00:14:52,907 --> 00:14:58,007
We should visit small cities on this trip.

393
00:14:58,007 --> 00:14:58,874
Places people don't usually visit.

394
00:14:58,874 --> 00:15:00,341
- Uncommon places? / - That's right.

395
00:15:00,341 --> 00:15:02,441
Kingston. We can go to Kingston.

396
00:15:02,441 --> 00:15:04,307
It's called Niagara-on-the-Lake.

397
00:15:04,307 --> 00:15:06,874
It's close to the Falls. It's 30 minutes away.

398
00:15:06,874 --> 00:15:09,674
It's beautiful. Small cities have their own charm.

399
00:15:09,674 --> 00:15:10,874
- I agree. / - Right.

400
00:15:10,874 --> 00:15:13,474
Then I'll just follow your lead.

401
00:15:13,474 --> 00:15:14,507
I don't know much about it.

402
00:15:14,507 --> 00:15:17,141
- Just follow me. / - Niagara Falls and Maple Road.

403
00:15:17,141 --> 00:15:19,074
We need a name for our tour.

404
00:15:19,074 --> 00:15:21,174
A name for our tour. For my first tour,

405
00:15:21,174 --> 00:15:24,741
it was Dubai and Italy, so I named it Dubaitaly.

406
00:15:27,341 --> 00:15:28,674
Are you laughing at me?

407
00:15:29,507 --> 00:15:31,974
(I'll think of a better name)

408
00:15:32,707 --> 00:15:33,774
It's completely up to us.

409
00:15:33,774 --> 00:15:35,507
Can we use Realistic Sibling Tour?

410
00:15:35,974 --> 00:15:37,774
- Realistic Sibling Tour? / - Yes.

411
00:15:37,774 --> 00:15:40,207
If real siblings go on a trip, it'll be us.

412
00:15:40,841 --> 00:15:42,507
I think I'm closer to you

413
00:15:42,507 --> 00:15:43,841
than your younger sister is to you.

414
00:15:43,841 --> 00:15:45,574
- I know about you more than her. / - That's true.

415
00:15:45,574 --> 00:15:47,174
- I know more than Jayeong, right? / - Right, right.

416
00:15:47,174 --> 00:15:48,741
- She knows her name. / - Yes.

417
00:15:49,574 --> 00:15:51,241
- Let's have fun on our trip. / - Yes.

418
00:15:51,341 --> 00:15:53,841
- Realistic Sibling. / - Tour!

419
00:15:54,674 --> 00:15:57,507
Even the locals don't know about this place.

420
00:15:57,507 --> 00:15:58,741
(Travel expert Hyorim and free spirited Honggi)

421
00:15:58,741 --> 00:16:00,107
Hurry up.

422
00:16:00,107 --> 00:16:01,941
You're so embarrassing.

423
00:16:01,941 --> 00:16:03,674
Geez.

424
00:16:03,674 --> 00:16:05,541
- Realistic Sibling. / - Tour.

425
00:16:06,841 --> 00:16:08,841
They look like a real brother and sister.

426
00:16:09,174 --> 00:16:10,941
Seagulls, attack her!

427
00:16:10,941 --> 00:16:12,374
You're crazy.

428
00:16:12,374 --> 00:16:13,407
That was the can.

429
00:16:13,407 --> 00:16:16,107
I'm experiencing all sorts of things traveling with you.

430
00:16:16,107 --> 00:16:18,007
Aren't you going to listen to me?

431
00:16:18,007 --> 00:16:20,341
You'd be so dead, if you were my real sister.

432
00:16:20,341 --> 00:16:21,007
Why you!

433
00:16:24,774 --> 00:16:26,041
That's so pretty.

434
00:16:26,041 --> 00:16:27,907
This is it.

435
00:16:27,907 --> 00:16:30,174
Let's go, let's go.

436
00:16:30,174 --> 00:16:31,474
Let's go.

437
00:16:31,474 --> 00:16:32,507
It looks like a commercial.

438
00:16:32,507 --> 00:16:36,074
(Finally, the day of their departure for Canada)

439
00:16:36,074 --> 00:16:38,507
Travelers get excited when they arrive at the airport.

440
00:16:38,507 --> 00:16:39,607
- It's when you're the most excited. / - Hello.

441
00:16:39,607 --> 00:16:40,741
You can't sleep the night before.

442
00:16:41,307 --> 00:16:42,974
We have arrived.

443
00:16:46,307 --> 00:16:49,107
Did Honggi arrive already?

444
00:16:49,707 --> 00:16:51,174
I think he did.

445
00:16:52,041 --> 00:16:55,307
(Bingo)

446
00:16:56,141 --> 00:16:58,674
Tell her to hurry. What's taking her so long?

447
00:16:59,607 --> 00:17:00,607
Hyorim!

448
00:17:01,807 --> 00:17:03,107
How many years are you apart?

449
00:17:03,274 --> 00:17:04,441
We have a big age gap.

450
00:17:04,441 --> 00:17:05,807
Okay. I see.

451
00:17:05,807 --> 00:17:07,641
- You didn't have to say that. / - Too much detail.

452
00:17:07,641 --> 00:17:09,141
- I won't go into details. / - Hey.

453
00:17:09,674 --> 00:17:11,607
Where is Honggi? Since we're going to...

454
00:17:12,541 --> 00:17:13,974
Canada

455
00:17:15,074 --> 00:17:16,474
I should give him a call.

456
00:17:17,574 --> 00:17:19,407
(A smart way to look for one's brother)

457
00:17:19,407 --> 00:17:21,307
(Looking around)

458
00:17:21,774 --> 00:17:23,274
I'm right here. Right here.

459
00:17:24,207 --> 00:17:25,107
Hey, there you are.

460
00:17:25,107 --> 00:17:26,574
- I was surprised at that time. / - Hurry up, will you?

461
00:17:27,007 --> 00:17:29,341
- Look at us. / - Hurry up. What?

462
00:17:29,907 --> 00:17:30,974
(They're wearing matching robes?)

463
00:17:30,974 --> 00:17:32,441
- We didn't plan it. / - We really didn't.

464
00:17:32,441 --> 00:17:34,341
- You both wore robes. / - I was so surprised.

465
00:17:34,341 --> 00:17:37,407
- Come on. You copied me. / - You copied me.

466
00:17:38,307 --> 00:17:40,874
- Stress. / - People might think we're a couple.

467
00:17:42,707 --> 00:17:44,007
(Honggi and Hyorim wear similar outfits)

468
00:17:44,007 --> 00:17:46,674
(No one got the wrong idea)

469
00:17:47,174 --> 00:17:48,641
- Why were you late? / - Hey.

470
00:17:48,907 --> 00:17:51,107
I was trying to get here quickly...

471
00:17:51,107 --> 00:17:52,574
- But I got hungry. / - Because of makeup?

472
00:17:52,574 --> 00:17:55,307
- No. / - Gosh, you think you're an actress.

473
00:17:55,307 --> 00:17:56,741
You think you're an actress.

474
00:17:56,741 --> 00:17:59,007
- She is an actress though. / - That was harsh.

475
00:17:59,007 --> 00:18:01,441
But he's dressed up just as much.

476
00:18:02,074 --> 00:18:04,274
Honggi, you look more like the actress.

477
00:18:05,374 --> 00:18:07,207
You're acting like an idol singer.

478
00:18:07,207 --> 00:18:09,007
You think I'm an idol singer?

479
00:18:09,107 --> 00:18:10,507
Yes, you're an idol singer.

480
00:18:10,574 --> 00:18:11,874
They can only say that to each other...

481
00:18:11,874 --> 00:18:13,574
- Because they're close. / - Right.

482
00:18:14,207 --> 00:18:15,674
- Are you going to Canada? / - Yes.

483
00:18:15,674 --> 00:18:17,341
- May I see your passports? / - Passport?

484
00:18:17,341 --> 00:18:18,641
(Their trip begins now)

485
00:18:18,674 --> 00:18:19,707
1, 2, 3.

486
00:18:19,707 --> 00:18:21,374
(Their preparation to set out is about done)

487
00:18:21,374 --> 00:18:22,707
This is light.

488
00:18:22,941 --> 00:18:24,374
Gosh, you're a man.

489
00:18:24,407 --> 00:18:25,674
- Exactly. / - Right.

490
00:18:25,907 --> 00:18:28,007
I feel like we're really going on a trip now.

491
00:18:28,241 --> 00:18:29,874
Gosh, for me...

492
00:18:29,874 --> 00:18:31,907
- I wish I was there already. / - Right?

493
00:18:32,007 --> 00:18:34,207
No lighters, portable chargers or...

494
00:18:34,207 --> 00:18:36,207
- Electronic cigarettes in the luggage, right? / - No.

495
00:18:36,874 --> 00:18:38,974
What if she's prone to explosion?

496
00:18:41,441 --> 00:18:43,707
Your boarding gate is 23.

497
00:18:43,707 --> 00:18:46,541
Please be at the gate by 5:15.

498
00:18:46,541 --> 00:18:49,941
You have to claim your luggage in Toronto.

499
00:18:49,941 --> 00:18:51,241
There's a direct flight to Toronto?

500
00:18:51,241 --> 00:18:53,474
- Yes, there's a direct flight to Toronto. / - 13 hours.

501
00:18:53,474 --> 00:18:55,007
But to see the Maple Road,

502
00:18:55,007 --> 00:18:57,574
you have to make a domestic transfer.

503
00:18:57,574 --> 00:19:00,574
You just have to pay extra $20 for the domestic flight.

504
00:19:00,574 --> 00:19:02,507
- $20? / - Yes, $20.

505
00:19:02,507 --> 00:19:04,774
You can get on another flight with just $20.

506
00:19:04,774 --> 00:19:06,941
You'll land in Sault Ste. Marie.

507
00:19:06,941 --> 00:19:08,541
Oh, that's French.

508
00:19:08,541 --> 00:19:15,307
(It takes 13 hours to Toronto International Airport)

509
00:19:15,307 --> 00:19:17,941
We'll head over to Sault Ste. Marie now.

510
00:19:18,574 --> 00:19:21,541
Bye. See you soon.

511
00:19:21,607 --> 00:19:24,407
If you go to Sault Ste. Marie by bus,

512
00:19:24,407 --> 00:19:25,774
it takes about 10 hours.

513
00:19:25,774 --> 00:19:28,241
The return ticket costs $150, but we only spent $20.

514
00:19:28,241 --> 00:19:31,607
- $20. / - We have arrived now.

515
00:19:31,607 --> 00:19:34,141
We're in Sault Ste. Marie.

516
00:19:34,141 --> 00:19:36,107
- Sault Ste. Marie. / - We took...

517
00:19:36,107 --> 00:19:39,474
An hour and 20 minute domestic flight here.

518
00:19:39,474 --> 00:19:41,474
- Right here... / - Wait, we just made an extra day.

519
00:19:41,474 --> 00:19:42,141
That's right.

520
00:19:42,407 --> 00:19:44,741
- We departed at... / - It was 6 p.m.

521
00:19:44,741 --> 00:19:46,974
We left at 6 p.m., so only 6 hours have passed.

522
00:19:46,974 --> 00:19:48,507
Exactly. We got an extra day.

523
00:19:48,507 --> 00:19:51,674
Right. It only took us 6 hours to arrive in Toronto

524
00:19:51,674 --> 00:19:54,507
and get on another flight to Sault Ste. Marie.

525
00:19:54,507 --> 00:19:58,241
- We're 13 hours behind. / - Right.

526
00:19:58,241 --> 00:20:01,307
- That's right. / - For me, this is...

527
00:20:01,307 --> 00:20:03,041
The best time zone because...

528
00:20:03,041 --> 00:20:04,874
- I sleep around this time. / - We could...

529
00:20:04,874 --> 00:20:07,407
- It worked out perfectly. / - It's time for you to sleep.

530
00:20:07,741 --> 00:20:10,274
Oh, right. I heard that

531
00:20:10,274 --> 00:20:12,441
there are not that many taxis in this city.

532
00:20:12,441 --> 00:20:14,007
I contacted the hotel

533
00:20:14,007 --> 00:20:15,507
and requested the pick-up service.

534
00:20:15,874 --> 00:20:17,407
- Hyorim is really thorough. / - We're going.

535
00:20:17,407 --> 00:20:19,007
- Bye. / - She makes it so convenient.

536
00:20:19,007 --> 00:20:20,007
She does.

537
00:20:20,207 --> 00:20:21,541
Let's go.

538
00:20:21,541 --> 00:20:25,874
(They will start their trip in Canada tomorrow)

539
00:20:30,707 --> 00:20:32,941
- At last. / - It's their first day of the trip.

540
00:20:32,941 --> 00:20:34,707
- Yes. / - The sky is so pretty.

541
00:20:35,107 --> 00:20:37,041
- We were right across it. / - We were facing the U.S.

542
00:20:37,041 --> 00:20:38,474
If you cross over, it's the U.S.

543
00:20:38,841 --> 00:20:40,207
If you live in a country with clean air,

544
00:20:40,207 --> 00:20:41,674
you can get up right away in the mornings.

545
00:20:41,674 --> 00:20:42,174
Of course.

546
00:20:42,174 --> 00:20:43,741
- Yeah. / - It's refreshing.

547
00:20:44,274 --> 00:20:46,507
- Good morning. / - Good morning.

548
00:20:46,674 --> 00:20:49,274
It's our first morning in Canada.

549
00:20:49,807 --> 00:20:52,007
- We must get coffee in the morning. / - Right.

550
00:20:52,641 --> 00:20:53,774
Did you sleep well?

551
00:20:53,941 --> 00:20:55,141
I didn't get a wink of sleep.

552
00:20:55,141 --> 00:20:57,341
Really? You sounded like you wouldn't be jet-lagged.

553
00:20:57,341 --> 00:21:00,807
No, it's not that. Something was off with my system.

554
00:21:00,807 --> 00:21:03,107
- Was there an error? / - My body system.

555
00:21:03,641 --> 00:21:04,941
It gets worse.

556
00:21:06,441 --> 00:21:08,141
When I was young, I didn't feel jet-lagged either.

557
00:21:08,441 --> 00:21:10,407
I feel jet-lagged in Korea.

558
00:21:11,441 --> 00:21:13,574
- It's a short walk. We can walk. / - But...

559
00:21:13,574 --> 00:21:15,107
Where are we going?

560
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:17,974
We're going to the train station for the Maple Road.

561
00:21:17,974 --> 00:21:19,441
Right. We ought to see that.

562
00:21:19,441 --> 00:21:21,241
It's summer in Canada.

563
00:21:21,241 --> 00:21:24,174
I heard the green Maple Road is just as beautiful.

564
00:21:31,241 --> 00:21:34,774
(Special ways to enjoy the Maple Road)

565
00:21:34,774 --> 00:21:36,907
Those were views I'd only seen on postcards.

566
00:21:36,907 --> 00:21:39,141
Maple Road. Even the name is pretty.

567
00:21:40,207 --> 00:21:45,041
(Fresh, green Maple Road)

568
00:21:45,341 --> 00:21:48,041
The very sight looks like the air would be clean.

569
00:21:48,641 --> 00:21:50,174
I really want to visit there.

570
00:21:50,174 --> 00:21:51,241
(Healing Day in Mother Nature of Canada)

571
00:21:51,241 --> 00:21:55,841
(Maple Train)

572
00:21:57,474 --> 00:21:58,274
Is this it?

573
00:21:58,274 --> 00:22:00,107
You should book the train ticket beforehand.

574
00:22:00,107 --> 00:22:02,674
- I booked them online. / - Book in advance.

575
00:22:02,807 --> 00:22:04,574
- Cart 3? / - Cart 3. It's right behind us.

576
00:22:04,574 --> 00:22:06,174
- There are no seat numbers? / - No.

577
00:22:06,174 --> 00:22:07,741
You just have to go in early and get your seat.

578
00:22:07,741 --> 00:22:09,074
(You can choose your seat within the assigned cart)

579
00:22:09,141 --> 00:22:11,041
- Bye. / - Bye.

580
00:22:11,041 --> 00:22:12,474
(Agawa Canyon Tour Train, $84 per person)

581
00:22:15,441 --> 00:22:17,974
- My gosh. It's coming. Let's go. / - Here it comes.

582
00:22:18,307 --> 00:22:21,474
We see these trains in the movies.

583
00:22:21,974 --> 00:22:23,674
- It's amazing. / - No way.

584
00:22:23,674 --> 00:22:26,807
(Agawa Canyon Tour Train runs 360km for 8 hours)

585
00:22:26,807 --> 00:22:28,907
- Look at the train. / - Hurry. Take some photos.

586
00:22:29,674 --> 00:22:32,774
- The train. / - Photos. Photos.

587
00:22:32,841 --> 00:22:34,774
Camera. Gosh, there's so much I have to do.

588
00:22:34,774 --> 00:22:36,374
Selfie. Let's take a selfie now.

589
00:22:36,641 --> 00:22:39,374
(They take a selfie with the incoming train)

590
00:22:39,374 --> 00:22:40,974
Here comes the train.

591
00:22:42,507 --> 00:22:44,507
It's not a train station we're familiar with.

592
00:22:44,507 --> 00:22:45,341
- Right? / - Yes, indeed.

593
00:22:45,341 --> 00:22:46,907
It's an open space.

594
00:22:46,907 --> 00:22:49,574
- Let's go. / - Agawa Canyon.

595
00:22:49,574 --> 00:22:50,774
Let's go.

596
00:22:50,774 --> 00:22:55,074
(They set out to Agawa Canyon by train)

597
00:22:55,074 --> 00:22:56,774
Here we go.

598
00:22:59,241 --> 00:23:01,907
(It's always exciting to set out to a new place)

599
00:23:01,907 --> 00:23:03,807
Trains ought to chug.

600
00:23:03,807 --> 00:23:05,807
(Chugging)

601
00:23:09,574 --> 00:23:11,774
- I feel like I'm going backwards. / - Yes.

602
00:23:11,974 --> 00:23:13,107
Oh, my God.

603
00:23:13,107 --> 00:23:15,641
Is that why there's a plastic bag?

604
00:23:15,641 --> 00:23:16,907
(That's for rubbish)

605
00:23:17,874 --> 00:23:19,174
(It's a travel brochure given to every passenger)

606
00:23:19,174 --> 00:23:20,307
What's this?

607
00:23:20,574 --> 00:23:22,074
It must be a guide book.

608
00:23:24,074 --> 00:23:25,374
Is there one in Korean?

609
00:23:25,474 --> 00:23:27,174
Sault Ste. Marie.

610
00:23:27,341 --> 00:23:29,541
- Oh, my God. / - We'll see that.

611
00:23:29,574 --> 00:23:30,874
We'll see that.

612
00:23:30,974 --> 00:23:32,974
Right. Exactly. That's it.

613
00:23:32,974 --> 00:23:34,974
We're starting from here.

614
00:23:35,641 --> 00:23:37,407
- We were in Sault Ste. Marie. / - Yes.

615
00:23:37,607 --> 00:23:39,441
We'll pass through here.

616
00:23:39,441 --> 00:23:41,874
Agawa Canyon is our destination.

617
00:23:42,941 --> 00:23:46,341
I see. We're passing by Agawa River.

618
00:23:47,141 --> 00:23:48,874
Doesn't it mean we should've come here with a baby?

619
00:23:48,874 --> 00:23:51,074
Exactly. That's why you're here.

620
00:23:54,141 --> 00:23:56,774
I bet it'd look fantastic during the fall here.

621
00:23:57,707 --> 00:24:01,507
The sky is really blue like it's been painted.

622
00:24:02,141 --> 00:24:03,207
The weather is great.

623
00:24:03,207 --> 00:24:05,241
- The weather is amazing. / - Yes.

624
00:24:05,241 --> 00:24:06,407
(Just looking at the scenery makes you feel good)

625
00:24:10,741 --> 00:24:11,641
(You're allowed to bring your food)

626
00:24:11,641 --> 00:24:14,374
It'd be nice to go with anyone.

627
00:24:14,641 --> 00:24:18,574
I think everything tastes good when you're on a train.

628
00:24:18,574 --> 00:24:20,341
- That's so true. / - Don't you agree?

629
00:24:20,341 --> 00:24:21,774
It depends on who you eat with.

630
00:24:21,774 --> 00:24:23,341
Why you little...

631
00:24:23,341 --> 00:24:25,807
- Yes, that's right. / - I see.

632
00:24:26,874 --> 00:24:28,041
What?

633
00:24:28,041 --> 00:24:31,274
I was going to say it's nice to eat with you.

634
00:24:31,274 --> 00:24:32,641
You should listen until the end.

635
00:24:32,641 --> 00:24:35,107
You're happy that you came with me, right?

636
00:24:35,641 --> 00:24:37,174
You two look really close.

637
00:24:39,274 --> 00:24:41,674
They're all maple trees on the side.

638
00:24:41,674 --> 00:24:42,907
- Yes. / - Amazing.

639
00:24:42,907 --> 00:24:44,674
- It must be very pretty in October. / - Yes.

640
00:24:44,674 --> 00:24:45,874
It must be really pretty.

641
00:24:46,074 --> 00:24:47,607
Look at the lake.

642
00:24:48,307 --> 00:24:50,574
- This is really pretty. / - What?

643
00:24:50,574 --> 00:24:52,841
This really looks like a foreign country.

644
00:24:52,841 --> 00:24:54,241
This really looks like Canada.

645
00:24:55,607 --> 00:24:57,274
This is Canada.

646
00:24:57,274 --> 00:24:59,507
He looks like an immature younger brother.

647
00:24:59,507 --> 00:25:01,007
(Honggi is like an immature brother)

648
00:25:01,907 --> 00:25:03,341
This really looks like Canada.

649
00:25:04,707 --> 00:25:06,374
This is Canada.

650
00:25:07,707 --> 00:25:08,674
(The lake reflects light brilliantly)

651
00:25:08,674 --> 00:25:11,107
- This is what I saw in textbooks. / - Yes.

652
00:25:12,807 --> 00:25:13,974
Look at the color.

653
00:25:15,074 --> 00:25:17,341
- It looks like computer graphics. / - It's so pretty.

654
00:25:18,041 --> 00:25:20,074
How can it be that color?

655
00:25:20,074 --> 00:25:22,107
(Montreal River Bridge is at 144km point)

656
00:25:22,107 --> 00:25:24,907
- It's really clear. / - It doesn't look stressful at all.

657
00:25:24,907 --> 00:25:26,107
That's amazing.

658
00:25:30,007 --> 00:25:33,507
(Gosh, it's so pretty)

659
00:25:33,507 --> 00:25:35,341
It's so pretty.

660
00:25:35,674 --> 00:25:37,607
The moment you get on the train,

661
00:25:37,607 --> 00:25:39,574
there is no signal.

662
00:25:39,574 --> 00:25:40,974
(You can completely relax in nature)

663
00:25:40,974 --> 00:25:43,574
- That's great. / - So you can...

664
00:25:43,574 --> 00:25:45,307
- Turn your phone off. / - Yes.

665
00:25:46,074 --> 00:25:47,607
(It's currently 11 p.m. in Korea)

666
00:25:47,607 --> 00:25:49,974
- He's jet lagged. / - He slept so well.

667
00:25:50,574 --> 00:25:51,941
So I couldn't see much.

668
00:25:52,974 --> 00:25:54,874
Since there was a forest,

669
00:25:54,874 --> 00:25:57,374
I kept looking for bears or deer. Then I fell asleep.

670
00:25:58,041 --> 00:26:00,741
But sleeping like that makes you feel at ease.

671
00:26:00,741 --> 00:26:03,174
(They arrive at primitive nature)

672
00:26:03,174 --> 00:26:04,374
That's pretty.

673
00:26:04,374 --> 00:26:06,407
(That was formed 2.5 billion years ago)

674
00:26:08,574 --> 00:26:10,141
(The final destination, Agawa Canyon)

675
00:26:10,141 --> 00:26:11,107
Agawa Canyon.

676
00:26:11,107 --> 00:26:13,441
Yes, it's Agawa Canyon Tour Train.

677
00:26:15,674 --> 00:26:16,807
That's so pretty.

678
00:26:18,141 --> 00:26:19,374
We're here.

679
00:26:19,374 --> 00:26:20,707
The weather is wonderful.

680
00:26:22,807 --> 00:26:24,607
Do you get off here and look around?

681
00:26:24,607 --> 00:26:26,807
- Yes, you get 1.5 to 2 hours. / - There is...

682
00:26:26,807 --> 00:26:29,207
An observatory where you can see everything.

683
00:26:31,441 --> 00:26:33,074
You were sleeping

684
00:26:33,074 --> 00:26:35,307
so you missed a huge lake.

685
00:26:36,474 --> 00:26:38,307
(Honggi is still jet lagged)

686
00:26:38,307 --> 00:26:41,774
They are going that way to see the waterfall.

687
00:26:41,774 --> 00:26:44,307
This way is to the observatory.

688
00:26:44,307 --> 00:26:47,374
Tomorrow, we'll see a bigger waterfall anyway.

689
00:26:47,507 --> 00:26:51,207
So we'll see the observatory first.

690
00:26:51,207 --> 00:26:53,207
It looks like you'll abandon Honggi.

691
00:26:53,774 --> 00:26:55,474
You slept too much.

692
00:26:55,974 --> 00:26:57,841
Gosh, the grassy smell.

693
00:26:59,074 --> 00:27:00,607
Grassy smell, my foot.

694
00:27:00,607 --> 00:27:02,274
You're just saying that.

695
00:27:02,274 --> 00:27:04,974
What? I can smell grass a lot.

696
00:27:06,774 --> 00:27:08,374
It's super blue.

697
00:27:08,941 --> 00:27:10,407
It's all blue, isn't it?

698
00:27:10,407 --> 00:27:12,341
I was so bored for four hours on the train.

699
00:27:12,341 --> 00:27:14,641
- It's sparkling. / - Because he was sleeping.

700
00:27:14,641 --> 00:27:17,507
(Canada's nature is unreal)

701
00:27:17,607 --> 00:27:19,907
- It's so pretty. / - It's beautiful.

702
00:27:21,674 --> 00:27:23,841
Oh, my God. I want to take a picture here.

703
00:27:24,574 --> 00:27:27,307
I want to go back!

704
00:27:27,307 --> 00:27:28,241
You have to do those things.

705
00:27:28,241 --> 00:27:30,641
I want to go back!

706
00:27:30,641 --> 00:27:31,674
(Something you want to shout on a train track)

707
00:27:32,141 --> 00:27:33,441
- Why did I do that? / - Isn't this it?

708
00:27:33,641 --> 00:27:34,974
Because you just woke up.

709
00:27:36,174 --> 00:27:37,441
(Hyorim takes pictures for Honggi)

710
00:27:37,441 --> 00:27:40,674
I want to go back!

711
00:27:41,441 --> 00:27:43,274
(Same train tracks, different feel)

712
00:27:43,274 --> 00:27:45,074
Honggi gets peevish after sleep.

713
00:27:46,441 --> 00:27:48,341
- You want this way? / - I want this way.

714
00:27:48,341 --> 00:27:49,507
(Hyorim wants the train in the background)

715
00:27:49,507 --> 00:27:51,407
I'm going to jump. Take a picture for me.

716
00:27:51,907 --> 00:27:53,641
- This way. / - A jump shot is the best.

717
00:27:53,641 --> 00:27:55,607
You should jump on the spot.

718
00:27:55,607 --> 00:27:57,374
1, 2, 3.

719
00:27:58,374 --> 00:28:01,574
(Honggi doesn't take it)

720
00:28:01,574 --> 00:28:04,241
One more time, 1, 2, 3.

721
00:28:04,841 --> 00:28:06,507
- Good. / - Did you get it?

722
00:28:07,174 --> 00:28:09,841
I think you made me jump more on purpose.

723
00:28:10,574 --> 00:28:12,307
It's upsetting if they take bad pictures

724
00:28:12,307 --> 00:28:13,941
when you jump so hard.

725
00:28:13,941 --> 00:28:14,774
I want to see the pictures.

726
00:28:14,774 --> 00:28:16,074
- That's good. / - You took it well.

727
00:28:16,074 --> 00:28:18,241
- I'm a good photographer. / - He's good.

728
00:28:18,241 --> 00:28:19,774
I'm bad at taking selfies

729
00:28:19,774 --> 00:28:21,141
but I take good pictures of the others.

730
00:28:21,474 --> 00:28:24,474
You shouldn't just take one picture

731
00:28:24,474 --> 00:28:25,874
but take bursts of pictures.

732
00:28:25,941 --> 00:28:28,441
You can delete the bad ones later.

733
00:28:28,474 --> 00:28:29,441
(They head to the observatory)

734
00:28:29,441 --> 00:28:31,774
At least you're wearing long pants.

735
00:28:33,407 --> 00:28:34,574
Gosh, this is...

736
00:28:34,574 --> 00:28:37,741
(The trees are densely packed)

737
00:28:38,707 --> 00:28:41,274
I really hate bugs.

738
00:28:41,274 --> 00:28:42,674
Do you hate bugs?

739
00:28:43,374 --> 00:28:45,607
Seriously. What's this?

740
00:28:45,607 --> 00:28:48,441
- No. / - It's just a twig!

741
00:28:48,441 --> 00:28:50,741
(Honggi is scared of a twig)

742
00:28:50,741 --> 00:28:53,241
- Goodness. / - Poor Honggi.

743
00:28:54,274 --> 00:28:55,274
It's a twig!

744
00:28:55,274 --> 00:28:58,107
I really hate bugs.

745
00:28:59,341 --> 00:29:01,507
(Come on, Honggi)

746
00:29:01,507 --> 00:29:03,274
I don't think this is good.

747
00:29:04,174 --> 00:29:06,007
I feel you, Honggi.

748
00:29:07,641 --> 00:29:09,707
- You know what, Hyorim? / - What?

749
00:29:10,541 --> 00:29:12,707
I hurt my leg.

750
00:29:12,774 --> 00:29:14,641
- Really? / - Suddenly?

751
00:29:14,641 --> 00:29:18,174
- Oh, no. Did you hurt your leg? / - Yes.

752
00:29:18,174 --> 00:29:19,807
Goodness. I'll give you a piggyback ride.

753
00:29:19,807 --> 00:29:21,007
(I'll give you a piggyback ride)

754
00:29:22,141 --> 00:29:23,507
- Come on. / - No.

755
00:29:23,507 --> 00:29:24,941
- Come here. / - You go.

756
00:29:24,941 --> 00:29:27,841
- I'll go back down. / - You hurt your leg?

757
00:29:27,841 --> 00:29:29,107
Be careful.

758
00:29:29,107 --> 00:29:31,174
I'll help you.

759
00:29:31,174 --> 00:29:32,074
What's this?

760
00:29:32,074 --> 00:29:34,807
- You look like his mom. / - She's like his mom.

761
00:29:34,807 --> 00:29:36,174
(Hyorim is climbing the canyon with a baby)

762
00:29:36,174 --> 00:29:37,941
- Is that a cub? / - A cub?

763
00:29:37,941 --> 00:29:40,741
Yes, that. No, it's a squirrel. There it is.

764
00:29:40,741 --> 00:29:42,307
- A squirrel. / - It's that one.

765
00:29:42,307 --> 00:29:44,007
- Yes. / - It's cute.

766
00:29:44,007 --> 00:29:46,541
Gosh, I hate bugs.

767
00:29:46,541 --> 00:29:47,674
I really hate bugs.

768
00:29:49,174 --> 00:29:50,841
You're not my type.

769
00:29:50,907 --> 00:29:52,574
Because the nature is so nice...

770
00:29:52,574 --> 00:29:54,907
- There are so many bugs. / - You're not my type.

771
00:29:55,374 --> 00:29:56,374
I see.

772
00:29:56,374 --> 00:29:57,507
We're almost there.

773
00:29:58,141 --> 00:29:59,874
(You just need to climb about 300 stairs)

774
00:30:01,274 --> 00:30:04,074
Aren't there like 1,040 stairs?

775
00:30:08,074 --> 00:30:09,707
I'll remember this, Honggi.

776
00:30:09,707 --> 00:30:10,807
(She clenches her teeth)

777
00:30:11,741 --> 00:30:13,607
(I'm watching you)

778
00:30:13,607 --> 00:30:14,941
Hurry up, will you?

779
00:30:15,841 --> 00:30:18,207
You said we'd go to somewhere fun and cool.

780
00:30:18,207 --> 00:30:19,941
We'll go there tomorrow.

781
00:30:21,741 --> 00:30:23,007
We're half way there.

782
00:30:25,941 --> 00:30:28,474
This is so nice. You get a leg workout.

783
00:30:28,541 --> 00:30:30,307
- It's nice. You can exercise. / - Right.

784
00:30:30,307 --> 00:30:32,107
- 200. / - The air is fresh too.

785
00:30:32,441 --> 00:30:34,141
We just climbed 200 stairs.

786
00:30:36,874 --> 00:30:39,907
(They talk less and less)

787
00:30:39,907 --> 00:30:41,007
Seriously.

788
00:30:42,407 --> 00:30:43,507
I'm tired.

789
00:30:44,907 --> 00:30:46,174
We're here.

790
00:30:46,307 --> 00:30:48,707
- She's like a mom. / - She really is.

791
00:30:49,874 --> 00:30:52,541
- It looks different from above. / - It was magnificent.

792
00:30:52,874 --> 00:30:55,541
- I think it'll look fantastic. / - It'll look great in fall.

793
00:30:58,107 --> 00:31:00,074
Honggi, it's amazing.

794
00:31:01,641 --> 00:31:04,141
- It looks picturesque. / - Goodness.

795
00:31:04,141 --> 00:31:06,141
- It's like a scene from a movie. / - Yes.

796
00:31:06,141 --> 00:31:14,441
(You can see everything up on the observatory)

797
00:31:14,441 --> 00:31:16,841
It looks fabulous when the leaves turn colors.

798
00:31:24,541 --> 00:31:27,041
(I have to take pictures)

799
00:31:28,841 --> 00:31:31,907
(Honggi finally gets to the top safely)

800
00:31:33,407 --> 00:31:34,541
(It looks different from here)

801
00:31:34,541 --> 00:31:35,641
Isn't it amazing?

802
00:31:36,507 --> 00:31:38,974
It's wonderful when the leaves change colors.

803
00:31:39,807 --> 00:31:41,041
The water is red.

804
00:31:41,707 --> 00:31:43,007
It does look red.

805
00:31:43,007 --> 00:31:44,174
- Yes. / - It does.

806
00:31:44,341 --> 00:31:45,674
It looks kind of like coffee.

807
00:31:46,141 --> 00:31:49,041
It's because the dirt has

808
00:31:49,041 --> 00:31:50,141
a lot of iron.

809
00:31:50,241 --> 00:31:52,174
- It's not limewater. / - It's so unique.

810
00:31:52,807 --> 00:31:54,274
Did you see "The Lord of the Rings?"

811
00:31:54,274 --> 00:31:55,641
I saw all of them.

812
00:31:56,141 --> 00:31:58,541
It looks like a fantasy movie.

813
00:31:58,807 --> 00:32:00,541
It reminds me of...

814
00:32:00,541 --> 00:32:03,207
- Old war films. / - Yes.

815
00:32:03,207 --> 00:32:04,207
Way before that.

816
00:32:04,207 --> 00:32:06,207
They must film a lot of movies here.

817
00:32:06,207 --> 00:32:08,141
- They do in Canada. / - Right?

818
00:32:08,141 --> 00:32:09,341
(Nature from 2.5 billion years ago)

819
00:32:11,374 --> 00:32:12,541
It looks pretty.

820
00:32:12,541 --> 00:32:14,841
- This has to be in the picture. / - Okay.

821
00:32:14,974 --> 00:32:16,841
He complains but he does everything.

822
00:32:16,841 --> 00:32:17,607
He does.

823
00:32:17,607 --> 00:32:19,407
Pictures are what you have left in the end.

824
00:32:19,407 --> 00:32:20,741
- That's right. / - Yes.

825
00:32:21,807 --> 00:32:23,141
(Like a character from a movie)

826
00:32:23,141 --> 00:32:24,641
That looks wonderful.

827
00:32:24,641 --> 00:32:26,641
(Looking for a friend who'll find the ring with me)

828
00:32:26,641 --> 00:32:28,641
Honggi complained but he took the most pictures.

829
00:32:28,641 --> 00:32:29,574
Yeah.

830
00:32:29,574 --> 00:32:33,841
(Let's go find the ring!)

831
00:32:33,841 --> 00:32:35,474
- Let's go back. / - We'll go back.

832
00:32:35,474 --> 00:32:38,274
- I'm so hungry. / - We'll get back on the train.

833
00:32:38,274 --> 00:32:40,274
We should have Canadian food since we're in Canada.

834
00:32:40,274 --> 00:32:41,974
- Canada... Steak? / - Yes.

835
00:32:41,974 --> 00:32:44,307
- Will we have steak? / - Yes, we will.

836
00:32:44,641 --> 00:32:46,507
Let's go.

837
00:32:46,507 --> 00:32:48,841
(It's time to go back to Sault Ste. Marie)

838
00:32:49,407 --> 00:32:52,807
(After a 2-hour stop, train returns to Sault Ste. Marie)

839
00:32:53,374 --> 00:32:54,707
You go back...

840
00:32:55,541 --> 00:32:56,607
Heading to Sault Ste. Marie, right?

841
00:32:56,607 --> 00:32:58,741
- Yes. / - Where we got on the train.

842
00:32:58,741 --> 00:33:00,241
(Traditional Canadian food)

843
00:33:00,241 --> 00:33:01,741
What is their traditional food?

844
00:33:03,841 --> 00:33:07,207
(After a long train tour, they have dinner)

845
00:33:07,207 --> 00:33:10,307
Sault Ste. Marie is a small town,

846
00:33:10,307 --> 00:33:12,441
so you can walk everywhere.

847
00:33:12,441 --> 00:33:15,407
Look at the time.

848
00:33:15,407 --> 00:33:17,274
- It's 6:45 p.m. / - Yes.

849
00:33:17,274 --> 00:33:19,741
- But the sun hasn't set. / - The sun is still out.

850
00:33:19,741 --> 00:33:21,074
Was it 9 p.m.?

851
00:33:21,074 --> 00:33:22,774
The sun was still out at 9 p.m.

852
00:33:23,441 --> 00:33:26,207
Because it's summer, the day is really long.

853
00:33:26,207 --> 00:33:27,941
So are we going to eat meat or not?

854
00:33:27,941 --> 00:33:30,374
We'll have steak like I said before.

855
00:33:30,374 --> 00:33:32,241
- You like steaks. / - Yes.

856
00:33:32,241 --> 00:33:34,174
Canadian steaks.

857
00:33:34,174 --> 00:33:36,307
We picked poutine as the main menu.

858
00:33:36,307 --> 00:33:39,274
Then we picked a menu that would go well with it.

859
00:33:39,274 --> 00:33:40,607
So we'll have poutine and steaks.

860
00:33:42,007 --> 00:33:49,241
(An old factory turned into a classy restaurant)

861
00:33:51,841 --> 00:33:53,441
This place must be famous.

862
00:33:53,441 --> 00:33:54,541
There are so many people.

863
00:33:54,774 --> 00:33:56,941
I can't believe I'm here with you.

864
00:33:58,774 --> 00:34:00,941
What about it? Are you sad that you're here with me?

865
00:34:01,174 --> 00:34:03,641
Steak and...

866
00:34:03,641 --> 00:34:05,607
They're realistic siblings.

867
00:34:06,207 --> 00:34:07,741
The younger brother that never listens.

868
00:34:07,841 --> 00:34:11,241
- The annoying type. / - And she's a nagging sister.

869
00:34:11,241 --> 00:34:12,141
When I think of Canada,

870
00:34:12,141 --> 00:34:14,707
poutine is the first thing that comes to mind.

871
00:34:14,707 --> 00:34:16,007
You know what poutine is, don't you?

872
00:34:16,074 --> 00:34:17,107
The president of Russia?

873
00:34:18,207 --> 00:34:20,641
- The president? / - Oh, my.

874
00:34:21,241 --> 00:34:22,607
What is poutine?

875
00:34:22,607 --> 00:34:26,207
Poutine is French fries with

876
00:34:26,207 --> 00:34:30,107
cheese and different ingredients.

877
00:34:30,107 --> 00:34:32,274
It's a typical Canadian dish.

878
00:34:32,274 --> 00:34:33,674
Gravy sauce is the most

879
00:34:33,674 --> 00:34:35,774
delicious and the fattiest sauce in the world.

880
00:34:35,774 --> 00:34:36,874
- Really? / - Yes.

881
00:34:36,874 --> 00:34:38,007
It's really delicious.

882
00:34:38,007 --> 00:34:39,807
- I want to try it. / - It's very delicious.

883
00:34:40,207 --> 00:34:44,007
Baby back ribs and rib eye steak.

884
00:34:44,007 --> 00:34:45,007
If we order them in big portions,

885
00:34:45,007 --> 00:34:46,674
it should be enough for us.

886
00:34:50,507 --> 00:34:52,174
The ribs were really good.

887
00:34:52,174 --> 00:34:54,207
And it's cheaper than in Korea.

888
00:34:54,207 --> 00:34:55,207
It comes in huge portion too.

889
00:34:55,207 --> 00:34:56,707
It was so big.

890
00:34:56,707 --> 00:35:00,341
(They start with a glass of cold beer)

891
00:35:00,341 --> 00:35:01,407
Oh, my God.

892
00:35:02,041 --> 00:35:03,941
- Thank you. / - I'm going to get the water for you.

893
00:35:03,941 --> 00:35:05,941
Canadian beer.

894
00:35:05,941 --> 00:35:08,941
This is Canadian beer.

895
00:35:09,341 --> 00:35:11,374
Different color.

896
00:35:12,507 --> 00:35:13,641
No head.

897
00:35:13,807 --> 00:35:15,974
- No head. / - He's good at English.

898
00:35:15,974 --> 00:35:18,941
- Cheers. Thank you. / - Happy New Year.

899
00:35:18,941 --> 00:35:20,707
- Out of the blue. / - So random.

900
00:35:20,941 --> 00:35:22,774
(This is cranberry juice)

901
00:35:22,941 --> 00:35:25,341
- It's so refreshing. / - Is it?

902
00:35:25,774 --> 00:35:27,274
(It looks delicious)

903
00:35:27,274 --> 00:35:29,907
- Mine is pretty sour. / - It's quite strong.

904
00:35:30,274 --> 00:35:32,807
- Strong? Really? / - It's a bit strong.

905
00:35:33,107 --> 00:35:34,541
It's like...

906
00:35:34,541 --> 00:35:37,574
Just one sip of beer makes my face red.

907
00:35:37,574 --> 00:35:40,241
- So I wasn't going to drink it. / - With a straw?

908
00:35:40,807 --> 00:35:43,274
- Once you start drinking... / - She'll drink it all.

909
00:35:43,941 --> 00:35:45,307
I don't know how to put it.

910
00:35:45,607 --> 00:35:46,707
It's a bit strong.

911
00:35:47,007 --> 00:35:48,707
It's like German beer.

912
00:35:49,641 --> 00:35:51,007
(My goodness)

913
00:35:51,007 --> 00:35:53,907
She eats aggressively with the cute face.

914
00:35:54,074 --> 00:35:56,974
It's like German beer. With high alcohol content.

915
00:35:56,974 --> 00:35:58,674
It's going down.

916
00:35:58,674 --> 00:35:59,974
It's not easy to drink it with a straw.

917
00:35:59,974 --> 00:36:01,007
It's like that beer.

918
00:36:02,541 --> 00:36:03,874
Because I'm drinking all his beer.

919
00:36:03,874 --> 00:36:04,941
What are you doing?

920
00:36:06,807 --> 00:36:08,241
What do you think you're doing?

921
00:36:08,641 --> 00:36:09,974
- What do you think you're doing? / - He's ruthless.

922
00:36:10,641 --> 00:36:13,207
How could you hit me in the forehead?

923
00:36:13,207 --> 00:36:14,807
- You're ugly. / - My goodness.

924
00:36:14,807 --> 00:36:16,341
What did you just say?

925
00:36:16,941 --> 00:36:18,041
Is that so?

926
00:36:18,507 --> 00:36:19,941
(I'll make you pay for this)

927
00:36:19,941 --> 00:36:23,607
How can I put it? It's strong but...

928
00:36:23,607 --> 00:36:26,441
- It was very delicious. / - It must have been soft.

929
00:36:26,441 --> 00:36:27,641
It feels like flat beer.

930
00:36:28,341 --> 00:36:30,441
It's not that carbonated.

931
00:36:30,741 --> 00:36:33,641
I'm so angry right now.

932
00:36:33,641 --> 00:36:35,674
- I'm so mad. / - Could you film us separately?

933
00:36:35,674 --> 00:36:37,641
A camera for her and one for me.

934
00:36:38,041 --> 00:36:39,307
We...

935
00:36:39,307 --> 00:36:41,041
How dare you hit me, you little twerp?

936
00:36:41,041 --> 00:36:43,107
Please film us separately.

937
00:36:43,107 --> 00:36:45,474
- You come here. / - What is this? Whiskey?

938
00:36:45,607 --> 00:36:46,707
Yes.

939
00:36:47,107 --> 00:36:48,441
- You can drink it in a gulp. / - Canadian whiskey?

940
00:36:48,441 --> 00:36:50,074
Yes, it's Canadian whiskey.

941
00:36:51,107 --> 00:36:52,874
He was convinced that it was whiskey.

942
00:36:53,141 --> 00:36:54,241
Is it maple syrup?

943
00:36:54,307 --> 00:36:56,241
- This is Hyorim's counterattack. / - Try a sip.

944
00:36:56,241 --> 00:36:58,307
I was saving it so I can eat it with meat later.

945
00:37:00,207 --> 00:37:02,307
- It smells different. / - It smells like sugar.

946
00:37:03,174 --> 00:37:05,274
- Try it. / - Is whiskey supposed to be this thick?

947
00:37:06,307 --> 00:37:07,741
He's quick.

948
00:37:08,307 --> 00:37:11,207
(He finally drinks it)

949
00:37:11,207 --> 00:37:13,241
(What does Canadian whiskey taste like?)

950
00:37:15,407 --> 00:37:16,074
(It tastes like sweet syrup)

951
00:37:16,074 --> 00:37:17,807
He fell for it.

952
00:37:17,807 --> 00:37:20,574
- Honggi doesn't like sweet things. / - Really?

953
00:37:20,574 --> 00:37:21,774
Really?

954
00:37:22,507 --> 00:37:23,274
Gosh, it's so sweet.

955
00:37:23,274 --> 00:37:25,441
(Honggi drank syrup)

956
00:37:25,441 --> 00:37:28,507
This is what you drizzle on pancakes.

957
00:37:28,507 --> 00:37:30,074
That's right. It's maple syrup.

958
00:37:30,074 --> 00:37:31,074
(It's a specialty of Canada, maple syrup)

959
00:37:32,141 --> 00:37:32,974
(Finally, Hyorim got revenge)

960
00:37:32,974 --> 00:37:34,141
The score is now 1 to 1.

961
00:37:34,574 --> 00:37:37,574
- It's delicious. / - We were on Maple Road today.

962
00:37:37,574 --> 00:37:39,174
- He's drinking more. / - Don't drink it out of the bottle.

963
00:37:39,174 --> 00:37:41,241
My mouth already became sweet.

964
00:37:41,774 --> 00:37:43,274
This is really good.

965
00:37:46,007 --> 00:37:49,607
It's sweet, but it's sweet.

966
00:37:50,807 --> 00:37:52,441
(What does that even mean?)

967
00:37:52,907 --> 00:37:54,974
(Drinking)

968
00:37:55,241 --> 00:37:57,607
Some might think I'm drinking whiskey.

969
00:37:57,874 --> 00:37:59,007
Hey.

970
00:37:59,007 --> 00:38:01,941
(I'm the unruly youngest of this area)

971
00:38:04,274 --> 00:38:05,541
What was wrong with me?

972
00:38:06,341 --> 00:38:07,607
You're always like that.

973
00:38:08,907 --> 00:38:11,841
- Oh, my God. / - It's poutine.

974
00:38:11,841 --> 00:38:14,107
- So, this is poutine? / - Yes, this is poutine.

975
00:38:14,641 --> 00:38:17,674
This is one of the typical dishes of Canada.

976
00:38:19,407 --> 00:38:22,641
It has cheese and potato in it.

977
00:38:22,641 --> 00:38:25,241
- Exactly. And the sauce. / - It looks so delicious.

978
00:38:27,507 --> 00:38:28,507
This is really delicious.

979
00:38:29,707 --> 00:38:31,674
It's very greasy and salty.

980
00:38:31,974 --> 00:38:34,674
- I love the sauce. / - The sauce is a little sweet.

981
00:38:35,141 --> 00:38:37,574
The potatoes are salty and the sauce is sweet.

982
00:38:37,574 --> 00:38:39,807
- The potatoes are salty. / - The cheese is sweet.

983
00:38:40,341 --> 00:38:41,774
It's sweet and savory.

984
00:38:41,874 --> 00:38:44,207
Its taste makes you feel guilty.

985
00:38:44,207 --> 00:38:46,174
- It's so delicious. / - It was really good.

986
00:38:46,174 --> 00:38:48,007
- It's a high-calorie dish. / - It's sweet and savory.

987
00:38:48,007 --> 00:38:49,107
Wendy, you must know how it tastes.

988
00:38:49,107 --> 00:38:50,841
Hang on. Seulgi seems like she's been won over.

989
00:38:50,841 --> 00:38:52,707
It looks so delicious.

990
00:38:52,707 --> 00:38:54,741
- What sauce is it? / - It's gravy sauce.

991
00:38:57,007 --> 00:38:58,541
It's sweet and savory.

992
00:38:59,774 --> 00:39:01,007
- It's so good. / - My gosh.

993
00:39:02,374 --> 00:39:03,874
This is really delicious.

994
00:39:05,307 --> 00:39:08,474
It's more like a bar snack than a meal.

995
00:39:09,974 --> 00:39:12,741
It tastes really good with beer.

996
00:39:12,741 --> 00:39:14,607
- I want to eat that again. / - I'm hungry.

997
00:39:16,041 --> 00:39:18,407
(The main dish is served)

998
00:39:19,707 --> 00:39:20,841
- This is rib eye steak. / - Hungry, right?

999
00:39:20,841 --> 00:39:21,974
- It's so big. / - I'm so hungry right now.

1000
00:39:23,441 --> 00:39:25,207
Baby back ribs.

1001
00:39:26,974 --> 00:39:29,341
- Oh, my God. / - It looks so soft.

1002
00:39:29,341 --> 00:39:32,641
The meat looks so juicy.

1003
00:39:32,641 --> 00:39:34,574
It was really delicious. I'm telling you.

1004
00:39:34,574 --> 00:39:36,007
- Is it pork or beef? / - It looks so good.

1005
00:39:41,141 --> 00:39:45,174
The steak is quite big.

1006
00:39:45,174 --> 00:39:46,974
- It's a big steak. / - It looks so delicious.

1007
00:39:46,974 --> 00:39:48,774
It's perfectly cooked.

1008
00:39:50,807 --> 00:39:51,974
It's so delicious.

1009
00:39:52,607 --> 00:39:54,441
The meat is so juicy.

1010
00:39:55,241 --> 00:39:57,374
The steak is so tender.

1011
00:39:57,374 --> 00:39:59,674
- It's so big. / - This must be a famous restaurant.

1012
00:39:59,841 --> 00:40:01,041
(Mmm)

1013
00:40:02,541 --> 00:40:03,607
- It's delicious. / - Right?

1014
00:40:03,907 --> 00:40:06,107
The steak is bigger than steaks in Korea.

1015
00:40:06,941 --> 00:40:09,407
It's perfectly seasoned.

1016
00:40:09,407 --> 00:40:11,707
You don't need any sauce.

1017
00:40:11,707 --> 00:40:13,407
It looks so delicious.

1018
00:40:13,407 --> 00:40:15,907
You can eat meat in Korea as well...

1019
00:40:15,907 --> 00:40:18,174
- But this tastes better. / - It has a beautiful color.

1020
00:40:18,641 --> 00:40:20,607
(He likes it)

1021
00:40:22,474 --> 00:40:25,074
(She's already eating the ribs)

1022
00:40:25,541 --> 00:40:27,574
(Baby back ribs, $27)

1023
00:40:28,741 --> 00:40:30,741
- It's baby back ribs. / - It's really delicious.

1024
00:40:30,741 --> 00:40:32,741
- The sauce was amazing. / - It was really delicious.

1025
00:40:35,174 --> 00:40:37,341
You can easily eat 100 ribs.

1026
00:40:37,341 --> 00:40:38,374
You're so right.

1027
00:40:38,374 --> 00:40:40,907
- It's seasoned very well. / - It's so tender.

1028
00:40:41,541 --> 00:40:43,107
Ribs are always delicious.

1029
00:40:44,241 --> 00:40:47,174
The sauce is different. If you order ribs in Korea...

1030
00:40:47,174 --> 00:40:49,807
- It's usually brown. / - It's brown.

1031
00:40:49,807 --> 00:40:50,641
That's common.

1032
00:40:50,641 --> 00:40:53,607
But I think they used tomato sauce here.

1033
00:40:53,607 --> 00:40:56,607
- It's a little spicy. / - It's like sweet ketchup.

1034
00:40:56,607 --> 00:40:58,074
It's like ketchup with sugar in it.

1035
00:40:59,041 --> 00:41:01,741
The ribs are much tastier than the ribs in Korea.

1036
00:41:03,607 --> 00:41:06,907
The meat just falls off the bone.

1037
00:41:06,907 --> 00:41:08,207
(Honggi gulps down the food)

1038
00:41:08,607 --> 00:41:10,007
It's really delicious.

1039
00:41:11,541 --> 00:41:12,607
The sauce is delicious.

1040
00:41:12,607 --> 00:41:15,441
- He makes it look really tasty. / - He eats so well.

1041
00:41:15,507 --> 00:41:17,007
I like this too but...

1042
00:41:18,374 --> 00:41:23,107
Poutine is traditional Canadian food.

1043
00:41:23,107 --> 00:41:24,074
Right.

1044
00:41:24,074 --> 00:41:26,207
They say you must try poutine in Canada.

1045
00:41:26,207 --> 00:41:28,007
- I really want to try it. / - This is...

1046
00:41:28,007 --> 00:41:29,674
- How can I say? / - I must try it.

1047
00:41:30,074 --> 00:41:32,274
As you know, I like beer.

1048
00:41:32,274 --> 00:41:35,074
This makes you crave for alcohol.

1049
00:41:36,741 --> 00:41:38,374
They sell this in Korea as well, right?

1050
00:41:38,374 --> 00:41:40,341
- It tastes different here. / - I haven't tried...

1051
00:41:40,341 --> 00:41:42,341
- Poutine in Korea yet. / - It's like mac and cheese.

1052
00:41:42,341 --> 00:41:44,374
- You must eat poutine in Canada. / - I see.

1053
00:41:44,374 --> 00:41:47,807
Eating this, it really feels like I'm in Canada.

1054
00:41:48,974 --> 00:41:51,007
- Looks so good with beer. / - He's happy now.

1055
00:41:51,007 --> 00:41:52,541
(You have been complaining the whole day)

1056
00:41:54,641 --> 00:41:55,607
It's really delicious.

1057
00:41:55,607 --> 00:41:56,841
(Healing in Mother Nature, the end)

1058
00:41:57,541 --> 00:42:00,341
Tomorrow, we're going to Niagara Falls.

1059
00:42:00,474 --> 00:42:02,441
I'm going to bring you there.

1060
00:42:03,074 --> 00:42:05,674
It's one of the places you must visit before you die.

1061
00:42:05,707 --> 00:42:08,041
- It's 1 of the top 3 biggest falls. / - It is.

1062
00:42:08,041 --> 00:42:09,607
I'm looking forward to it.

1063
00:42:10,041 --> 00:42:11,941
I believe there will be something more than just that.

1064
00:42:11,941 --> 00:42:15,307
Of course. I'm sure you'll like it.

1065
00:42:16,507 --> 00:42:19,174
(The real trip in Canada begins now)

1066
00:42:19,174 --> 00:42:20,407
It looks amazing.

1067
00:42:21,007 --> 00:42:23,374
Isn't it just a waterfall, after all?

1068
00:42:23,374 --> 00:42:26,041
It's not just a waterfall. There's a lot more to it.

1069
00:42:26,041 --> 00:42:28,507
(To make it more thrilling)

1070
00:42:28,507 --> 00:42:30,441
(They ride down to the falls)

1071
00:42:31,474 --> 00:42:33,507
(They have a closer look at the falls)

1072
00:42:33,807 --> 00:42:36,807
- Did you take a boat there? / - I've seen that a lot.

1073
00:42:36,807 --> 00:42:37,541
I really want to try this.

1074
00:42:37,541 --> 00:42:38,574
It feels like we're going to get sucked in.

1075
00:42:38,574 --> 00:42:40,174
(They enjoy Niagara Falls in special ways)

1076
00:42:41,241 --> 00:42:44,074
(Everything about Niagara Falls)

1077
00:42:44,074 --> 00:42:45,741
Our trip in Canada has just begun.

1078
00:42:45,741 --> 00:42:48,274
(Niagara Falls won't let you down)

1079
00:42:48,874 --> 00:42:52,907
(Killing Day in Mother Nature of Canada)

1080
00:42:52,907 --> 00:42:56,841
(Zip-line, cruise, dinner)

1081
00:42:57,307 --> 00:42:59,974
The next day, we went to Toronto.

1082
00:42:59,974 --> 00:43:01,307
- You flew to Toronto. / - Yes.

1083
00:43:01,307 --> 00:43:03,207
(Sault Ste. Marie, Toronto, Niagara Falls)

1084
00:43:04,041 --> 00:43:10,907
(70 minutes from Sault Ste. Marie to Toronto)

1085
00:43:11,474 --> 00:43:13,774
Here we are.

1086
00:43:13,774 --> 00:43:16,041
Finally, we're going to Niagara Falls.

1087
00:43:16,574 --> 00:43:18,541
My nose is runny.

1088
00:43:19,041 --> 00:43:20,507
- Really? / - Yes.

1089
00:43:21,374 --> 00:43:25,741
Once you see Niagara Falls, you will get better.

1090
00:43:26,541 --> 00:43:28,407
(Disappointed)

1091
00:43:29,141 --> 00:43:30,707
(I was just joking)

1092
00:43:31,174 --> 00:43:34,841
Here we are. We can take an airbus here.

1093
00:43:34,841 --> 00:43:37,241
You ride it with many people.

1094
00:43:37,241 --> 00:43:39,574
It takes about 90 minutes. It won't take long.

1095
00:43:39,574 --> 00:43:41,207
- You can get there right away. / - Yes.

1096
00:43:41,207 --> 00:43:43,774
- Air bus. / - You don't have to go to the city center.

1097
00:43:43,774 --> 00:43:47,007
You can reserve an airbus like we did.

1098
00:43:47,007 --> 00:43:48,741
It not only saves your time...

1099
00:43:48,741 --> 00:43:50,474
- But also, it's convenient. / - You need to spend a bit.

1100
00:43:50,474 --> 00:43:52,241
- For the convenience. / - Time is money.

1101
00:43:53,207 --> 00:43:55,874
It's written there, Niagara airbus.

1102
00:43:56,441 --> 00:43:59,207
It's about $70 per person.

1103
00:43:59,907 --> 00:44:02,041
It's convenient to ride this.

1104
00:44:02,041 --> 00:44:05,774
Otherwise, we have to go to the city center first

1105
00:44:05,774 --> 00:44:07,774
and then take a bus there,

1106
00:44:07,774 --> 00:44:09,074
which takes about 4 hours.

1107
00:44:09,741 --> 00:44:12,241
If you take a bus from here, it takes about 90 minutes.

1108
00:44:15,007 --> 00:44:16,874
- Nice to meet you. / - Hello.

1109
00:44:16,874 --> 00:44:19,474
Welcome to Niagara Falls.

1110
00:44:19,474 --> 00:44:21,441
- It was a really nice car. / - Was it comfortable?

1111
00:44:21,441 --> 00:44:23,174
It was a really nice car.

1112
00:44:25,074 --> 00:44:26,307
It looks nice.

1113
00:44:26,307 --> 00:44:28,441
It's a nice bus.

1114
00:44:29,707 --> 00:44:31,507
Do you like it?

1115
00:44:31,507 --> 00:44:33,407
Yes, we like it.

1116
00:44:33,407 --> 00:44:36,641
The car doesn't have to be full to depart.

1117
00:44:36,641 --> 00:44:39,107
As long as you have a reservation...

1118
00:44:39,107 --> 00:44:41,307
- It will take off right away. / - That's nice.

1119
00:44:42,107 --> 00:44:47,041
(Toronto Airport, Niagara Falls)

1120
00:44:48,141 --> 00:44:51,241
(A fancy street reminds them of Las Vegas)

1121
00:44:51,241 --> 00:44:54,207
This area is called Clifton Hill.

1122
00:44:54,907 --> 00:44:58,341
It's a town that is right in front of Niagara Falls.

1123
00:44:58,341 --> 00:45:00,041
Seriously.

1124
00:45:00,307 --> 00:45:02,574
The Canada trip has just begun.

1125
00:45:04,174 --> 00:45:06,041
- I also... / - I love it here.

1126
00:45:06,041 --> 00:45:07,607
I also feel like I came to a city from the countryside.

1127
00:45:07,607 --> 00:45:09,241
I like it to be crowded like this.

1128
00:45:09,241 --> 00:45:10,374
He's happy to be in a city.

1129
00:45:10,374 --> 00:45:12,374
Honggi is excited.

1130
00:45:12,374 --> 00:45:14,174
(He releases the cheerful energy)

1131
00:45:14,907 --> 00:45:16,507
(The bubbles alone make him excited)

1132
00:45:16,507 --> 00:45:18,407
Honggi loves this kind of place.

1133
00:45:18,974 --> 00:45:21,507
It's really nice here.

1134
00:45:21,507 --> 00:45:22,574
It's nice, isn't it?

1135
00:45:23,074 --> 00:45:23,774
(She feels proud)

1136
00:45:23,774 --> 00:45:25,941
I knew you would love this place.

1137
00:45:27,474 --> 00:45:30,507
(This place is 100% Honggi's type of place)

1138
00:45:32,374 --> 00:45:33,841
(Hyorim is busy looking for a restaurant)

1139
00:45:33,841 --> 00:45:35,607
It's really nice here.

1140
00:45:36,474 --> 00:45:37,707
I found it.

1141
00:45:37,907 --> 00:45:39,874
Funnel cake.

1142
00:45:40,241 --> 00:45:42,641
(What is funnel cake?)

1143
00:45:42,641 --> 00:45:43,941
I heard it's famous here.

1144
00:45:44,307 --> 00:45:49,041
(It's deep-fried pastry with syrup, ice cream, toppings)

1145
00:45:49,041 --> 00:45:51,741
- It's funnel cake. / - This...

1146
00:45:52,107 --> 00:45:54,041
- It's... / - Wendy got excited.

1147
00:45:54,041 --> 00:45:55,641
- She just got so excited. / - Do you know it?

1148
00:45:55,641 --> 00:45:56,974
- She reacted right away. / - I'm sorry.

1149
00:45:56,974 --> 00:45:58,107
It's so delicious.

1150
00:45:58,107 --> 00:45:59,774
Is it different from normal cakes?

1151
00:45:59,774 --> 00:46:02,807
It's not a cake. It's more like cookies with

1152
00:46:02,807 --> 00:46:05,407
fruits and different kinds of toppings.

1153
00:46:05,407 --> 00:46:07,474
- You choose your toppings. / - It's really good.

1154
00:46:08,241 --> 00:46:09,641
- Let's see. / - Let's eat this.

1155
00:46:11,741 --> 00:46:14,007
We don't have time for this.

1156
00:46:14,341 --> 00:46:16,007
There are so many things to do.

1157
00:46:17,341 --> 00:46:19,107
(Hyorim goes to buy funnel cake alone)

1158
00:46:19,107 --> 00:46:20,407
What should I order?

1159
00:46:20,741 --> 00:46:22,541
(There are different toppings you can choose)

1160
00:46:22,541 --> 00:46:24,307
Could you please give me recommendation?

1161
00:46:24,307 --> 00:46:26,807
- Recommendation? / - Yes. Famous...

1162
00:46:26,807 --> 00:46:27,941
Do you like fresh fruit?

1163
00:46:27,941 --> 00:46:29,507
Would you like the strawberry and ice cream one?

1164
00:46:29,507 --> 00:46:30,974
- Yes. / - Okay.

1165
00:46:30,974 --> 00:46:32,874
(She chooses strawberries and ice cream)

1166
00:46:33,407 --> 00:46:34,874
I wonder how it'd taste.

1167
00:46:35,207 --> 00:46:37,307
I have never tried this before.

1168
00:46:38,074 --> 00:46:43,274
(1. Deep fry pastries in twisted-shape)

1169
00:46:43,274 --> 00:46:45,307
(2. Add fruits and syrup)

1170
00:46:45,307 --> 00:46:47,141
That's it.

1171
00:46:47,574 --> 00:46:49,774
- Strawberries on top. / - Sugar powder.

1172
00:46:49,774 --> 00:46:51,907
- Sugar powder is the best. / - Oh, my gosh.

1173
00:46:52,074 --> 00:46:53,374
Oh, my God.

1174
00:46:53,374 --> 00:46:55,341
Everything delicious goes in it.

1175
00:46:55,407 --> 00:46:56,507
Syrup!

1176
00:46:56,507 --> 00:46:58,274
That costs about $10.

1177
00:46:58,274 --> 00:47:00,207
- It's cheap. / - It was so delicious.

1178
00:47:00,207 --> 00:47:01,607
That's really delicious.

1179
00:47:02,874 --> 00:47:07,107
Honggi said he hates ice cream and fried food.

1180
00:47:07,774 --> 00:47:08,907
(A funnel cake, $10)

1181
00:47:08,907 --> 00:47:11,141
Honggi must hate this dish.

1182
00:47:11,707 --> 00:47:13,074
- It looks amazing. / - I want to try it.

1183
00:47:13,074 --> 00:47:14,941
That must be really delicious.

1184
00:47:14,941 --> 00:47:16,207
(Caramel syrup, ice cream, strawberries, pastry)

1185
00:47:16,941 --> 00:47:18,341
- It's ready. / - There you go.

1186
00:47:19,641 --> 00:47:21,707
It looks delicious.

1187
00:47:21,707 --> 00:47:24,641
- Enjoy. / - Thank you.

1188
00:47:25,641 --> 00:47:28,707
(She heads out to taste the funnel cake)

1189
00:47:29,474 --> 00:47:31,007
Ta-da.

1190
00:47:33,007 --> 00:47:37,141
Canada doesn't really have local traditional food.

1191
00:47:37,141 --> 00:47:40,874
I think that's why they have good desserts.

1192
00:47:40,874 --> 00:47:41,707
What do you think?

1193
00:47:41,707 --> 00:47:42,874
(They focus on dessert on this trip)

1194
00:47:44,141 --> 00:47:46,074
(She takes a big bite)

1195
00:47:47,374 --> 00:47:49,607
The ice cream tastes ordinary

1196
00:47:49,607 --> 00:47:51,674
but the donut is chewy.

1197
00:47:51,941 --> 00:47:54,074
The donut is delicious.

1198
00:47:54,707 --> 00:47:57,807
The donut was very chewy and crispy.

1199
00:47:57,941 --> 00:48:01,107
- I have never tasted such bread. / - It looks so good.

1200
00:48:02,407 --> 00:48:03,474
What do you think?

1201
00:48:03,474 --> 00:48:04,707
(She's expectant and worried)

1202
00:48:04,807 --> 00:48:06,974
It's too sweet.

1203
00:48:08,441 --> 00:48:09,574
- My gosh. / - He's honest.

1204
00:48:09,574 --> 00:48:11,541
- He's indeed the youngest. / - It's really tasty.

1205
00:48:11,707 --> 00:48:13,374
Do you not like sweet things?

1206
00:48:13,641 --> 00:48:15,574
No, I don't like sweet things.

1207
00:48:15,574 --> 00:48:17,607
I'm glad there are strawberries.

1208
00:48:17,907 --> 00:48:20,007
It'd be so bad without the strawberries.

1209
00:48:20,474 --> 00:48:22,174
I'll start eating it for real now.

1210
00:48:24,241 --> 00:48:26,307
(I can't believe you can eat more of this sweet thing)

1211
00:48:26,707 --> 00:48:28,874
(She keeps eating)

1212
00:48:28,874 --> 00:48:30,941
This is a must-try. It's really delicious.

1213
00:48:33,074 --> 00:48:36,941
(While Hyorim eats, Honggi waits for her to finish)

1214
00:48:36,974 --> 00:48:39,141
Stop eating. You finished it.

1215
00:48:39,574 --> 00:48:42,474
I'm finished now. Don't nag me about eating.

1216
00:48:42,474 --> 00:48:45,541
You're eating this for 30 minutes now.

1217
00:48:46,674 --> 00:48:48,541
The rides will be closed soon.

1218
00:48:48,541 --> 00:48:51,041
- We're going to ride them now. / - Really?

1219
00:48:51,707 --> 00:48:52,707
Go?

1220
00:48:52,707 --> 00:48:52,974
- Let's go. / - Let's go.

1221
00:48:52,974 --> 00:48:55,241
- Do you feel better now? / - Let's hurry. Yes.

1222
00:48:55,241 --> 00:48:56,841
- Let's go. / - Take your time.

1223
00:48:56,841 --> 00:48:59,441
They seem to make a pretty good team.

1224
00:48:59,841 --> 00:49:01,441
- Follow me. / - Let's go.

1225
00:49:01,441 --> 00:49:03,174
(Hurry up and follow me)

1226
00:49:05,107 --> 00:49:07,107
This is Canada.

1227
00:49:07,607 --> 00:49:08,974
This is Canada.

1228
00:49:08,974 --> 00:49:09,874
I knew you'd like this place.

1229
00:49:09,874 --> 00:49:12,174
- Did you see that road earlier? / - Yes.

1230
00:49:12,474 --> 00:49:14,174
- It was shiny. / - It was so shiny.

1231
00:49:14,174 --> 00:49:16,407
This is my kind of place.

1232
00:49:16,641 --> 00:49:18,207
I'm really looking forward to the trip today.

1233
00:49:18,207 --> 00:49:21,141
Finally, we arrived at Niagara Falls.

1234
00:49:21,141 --> 00:49:23,007
- Is this it? / - No.

1235
00:49:23,007 --> 00:49:24,241
Is this Niagara Falls?

1236
00:49:24,241 --> 00:49:25,607
Look behind you.

1237
00:49:25,607 --> 00:49:27,641
I look so stupid.

1238
00:49:29,041 --> 00:49:31,674
- This way. Hurry up. / - Where?

1239
00:49:32,607 --> 00:49:33,874
- Where? / - Let's go.

1240
00:49:34,541 --> 00:49:36,274
Ta-da!

1241
00:49:36,274 --> 00:49:37,841
(Wow)

1242
00:49:38,507 --> 00:49:40,774
(He dropped his jaw in awe)

1243
00:49:41,274 --> 00:49:43,241
(What does Niagara Falls look like?)

1244
00:49:43,241 --> 00:49:44,841
Where is it?

1245
00:49:45,107 --> 00:49:47,074
It's over there.

1246
00:49:47,074 --> 00:49:48,541
(What does Niagara Falls look like?)

1247
00:49:57,607 --> 00:49:59,441
It's fascinating.

1248
00:49:59,441 --> 00:50:02,241
This is something you must see before you die.

1249
00:50:02,241 --> 00:50:04,307
(It's one of the top 3 waterfalls in the world)

1250
00:50:04,307 --> 00:50:10,774
(The one in Canada is 55m high and 671m wide)

1251
00:50:13,874 --> 00:50:16,107
That one is in the U.S.

1252
00:50:16,674 --> 00:50:18,007
Do you see the one on the right?

1253
00:50:18,007 --> 00:50:19,041
The more amazing looking one.

1254
00:50:19,041 --> 00:50:21,241
That's Niagara Falls on Canada side.

1255
00:50:22,007 --> 00:50:24,441
This place is really close to New York.

1256
00:50:24,874 --> 00:50:26,541
If you cross one big road,

1257
00:50:26,541 --> 00:50:27,441
it's New York.

1258
00:50:27,807 --> 00:50:29,441
- New York? / - Yes, New York is right next to it.

1259
00:50:29,507 --> 00:50:32,341
- New York? / - New York, the state.

1260
00:50:32,941 --> 00:50:34,674
There's a U.S. flag over there.

1261
00:50:34,941 --> 00:50:37,107
If you cross Rainbow Bridge over there,

1262
00:50:37,107 --> 00:50:38,307
you're in the U.S.

1263
00:50:41,874 --> 00:50:44,107
From what I heard, the waterfall on the Canada side

1264
00:50:44,107 --> 00:50:46,207
is much cooler than the ones on the U.S. side.

1265
00:50:46,207 --> 00:50:48,641
The falls in Canada look more magnificent.

1266
00:50:48,641 --> 00:50:50,641
This is amazing.

1267
00:50:50,641 --> 00:50:52,941
This is really amazing.

1268
00:50:52,941 --> 00:50:55,107
Just watching it gives me goose bumps.

1269
00:50:55,107 --> 00:50:56,874
I should visit Niagara Falls.

1270
00:51:02,307 --> 00:51:04,607
This is something you must see before you die.

1271
00:51:05,074 --> 00:51:06,541
I heard it looks much more amazing

1272
00:51:06,541 --> 00:51:07,374
from down there...

1273
00:51:07,374 --> 00:51:08,974
- Than from here. / - But we can't go down there.

1274
00:51:08,974 --> 00:51:10,841
- We can. / - We can?

1275
00:51:10,841 --> 00:51:12,107
We should.

1276
00:51:12,107 --> 00:51:13,741
You said you like outdoor activities.

1277
00:51:13,741 --> 00:51:15,941
- That's not an activity. / - You're wrong.

1278
00:51:15,941 --> 00:51:18,641
- There's something fun down there. / - What is that?

1279
00:51:18,641 --> 00:51:19,774
Let's go.

1280
00:51:25,641 --> 00:51:26,874
Where is it?

1281
00:51:26,874 --> 00:51:29,307
- Where is it? / - We're finally here.

1282
00:51:29,774 --> 00:51:32,074
- Do you see it? / - Oh, this?

1283
00:51:32,074 --> 00:51:34,007
The activity that you like.

1284
00:51:35,607 --> 00:51:38,074
It's a zip-line.

1285
00:51:38,074 --> 00:51:39,507
(The first way to enjoy Niagara Falls is by the zip-line)

1286
00:51:40,007 --> 00:51:43,941
(You've seen a lot of zip-lines on our show)

1287
00:51:45,241 --> 00:51:47,307
(Forget about all the other zip-lines)

1288
00:51:48,174 --> 00:51:50,174
(This zip-line is on another level)

1289
00:51:50,707 --> 00:51:53,607
(You can see Niagara Falls while riding this zip-line)

1290
00:51:54,074 --> 00:51:58,407
(The spectacular view and the thrill is a bonus)

1291
00:51:58,407 --> 00:52:01,241
(Exciting activity, a zip-line)

1292
00:52:01,274 --> 00:52:04,307
This place is open only from June until October.

1293
00:52:04,541 --> 00:52:06,874
I can't miss something like this.

1294
00:52:06,874 --> 00:52:08,641
- Exactly. / - We came all the way here.

1295
00:52:08,641 --> 00:52:10,307
It looks pretty high.

1296
00:52:10,507 --> 00:52:12,141
Come on. It's not high.

1297
00:52:12,141 --> 00:52:14,041
Can you go on the zip-line at any time?

1298
00:52:14,041 --> 00:52:16,507
You have to queue first.

1299
00:52:16,574 --> 00:52:18,074
- You have to queue there? / - Is it a long queue?

1300
00:52:18,074 --> 00:52:21,507
You can ride the zip-line only from June...

1301
00:52:21,507 --> 00:52:23,841
- Until the end of October. / - Why?

1302
00:52:23,841 --> 00:52:25,707
Because it could be dangerous. It can be cold.

1303
00:52:25,707 --> 00:52:28,874
In November, it's open only on weekends.

1304
00:52:29,707 --> 00:52:31,641
Thank you.

1305
00:52:32,307 --> 00:52:35,407
(They sign the agreement)

1306
00:52:35,574 --> 00:52:37,274
- Let's go. / - It's done. Let's go.

1307
00:52:37,407 --> 00:52:38,607
We're finished.

1308
00:52:38,874 --> 00:52:40,407
We had to sign the agreement.

1309
00:52:40,407 --> 00:52:42,207
(They walk out with light steps)

1310
00:52:42,207 --> 00:52:43,607
We have to weigh ourselves.

1311
00:52:43,974 --> 00:52:44,974
It's quite complicated.

1312
00:52:44,974 --> 00:52:46,141
You have to weigh yourself too.

1313
00:52:46,141 --> 00:52:48,141
That was a bit...

1314
00:52:48,241 --> 00:52:49,541
I don't like that.

1315
00:52:49,641 --> 00:52:51,974
(You have to weigh between 29kg and 139kg)

1316
00:52:51,974 --> 00:52:54,674
Can I take off my shoes?

1317
00:52:55,174 --> 00:52:56,807
I should weigh myself precisely.

1318
00:52:58,674 --> 00:53:00,207
- Thank you. / - You're welcome.

1319
00:53:01,574 --> 00:53:04,541
(Let me weigh myself precisely)

1320
00:53:04,841 --> 00:53:06,841
Just do it.

1321
00:53:08,407 --> 00:53:10,974
Why don't you just do it? Gosh.

1322
00:53:11,774 --> 00:53:13,441
What are you doing?

1323
00:53:13,441 --> 00:53:14,941
(Honggi's perspective of Hyorim)

1324
00:53:15,441 --> 00:53:17,107
The cameraman kept trying to film it.

1325
00:53:17,107 --> 00:53:17,674
(She feels uneasy)

1326
00:53:17,674 --> 00:53:19,807
(She desperately covers the number)

1327
00:53:20,241 --> 00:53:23,474
- Thank you. / - There you go.

1328
00:53:23,474 --> 00:53:25,141
(She successfully and secretly got a helmet)

1329
00:53:26,707 --> 00:53:28,241
- It's this way. / - It's measured in pounds.

1330
00:53:28,374 --> 00:53:30,041
How many pounds are you?

1331
00:53:30,941 --> 00:53:32,141
(He won't tell her)

1332
00:53:32,141 --> 00:53:35,474
I was about 105 pounds.

1333
00:53:35,474 --> 00:53:36,474
(If I'm 105 pounds, that means)

1334
00:53:36,474 --> 00:53:39,674
How many kilograms is that?

1335
00:53:39,974 --> 00:53:41,507
It's 47kg.

1336
00:53:41,641 --> 00:53:42,674
47kg?

1337
00:53:42,874 --> 00:53:45,341
(Laughing)

1338
00:53:45,341 --> 00:53:46,574
You can air this.

1339
00:53:47,541 --> 00:53:49,007
47kg.

1340
00:53:49,041 --> 00:53:51,274
When she's so tall? She's so skinny.

1341
00:53:51,274 --> 00:53:53,441
To be honest, I'm 50kg.

1342
00:53:53,574 --> 00:53:54,741
You're so skinny.

1343
00:53:56,174 --> 00:53:57,774
Let's go. We're on top now.

1344
00:53:58,341 --> 00:54:00,141
We can see the waterfall better.

1345
00:54:01,441 --> 00:54:03,307
(You can see Niagara Falls in one glance)

1346
00:54:03,307 --> 00:54:04,407
It's so nice.

1347
00:54:04,407 --> 00:54:07,774
- They're going. / - They're going.

1348
00:54:08,141 --> 00:54:09,241
(Just in time, other tourists are starting to take off)

1349
00:54:09,241 --> 00:54:12,574
(They're going down at a faster speed than expected)

1350
00:54:12,574 --> 00:54:14,174
- Oh, my. / - It looks fun.

1351
00:54:14,174 --> 00:54:15,707
It must be fun.

1352
00:54:15,774 --> 00:54:18,274
- How high is it? / - It's high.

1353
00:54:18,274 --> 00:54:19,774
- Is it very high? / - It's quite high.

1354
00:54:19,841 --> 00:54:21,574
Are you kidding me?

1355
00:54:21,574 --> 00:54:22,641
(Gosh, it's not that much of a big deal)

1356
00:54:22,641 --> 00:54:24,341
It's still scary.

1357
00:54:24,341 --> 00:54:26,274
How is this scary?

1358
00:54:26,507 --> 00:54:28,941
(Deep breaths)

1359
00:54:29,141 --> 00:54:31,241
(Hyorim is nervous about the zip-line)

1360
00:54:31,941 --> 00:54:33,874
- We're ready now. / - I'm a little nervous.

1361
00:54:34,374 --> 00:54:36,041
Why would you be nervous?

1362
00:54:36,574 --> 00:54:38,341
I've never tried this before.

1363
00:54:38,541 --> 00:54:40,074
I have a lot of problems.

1364
00:54:40,074 --> 00:54:41,341
(The reason why she is so nervous)

1365
00:54:41,341 --> 00:54:42,774
I have a lot of problems.

1366
00:54:44,607 --> 00:54:45,807
I'm acrophobic.

1367
00:54:46,074 --> 00:54:48,241
Oh, acrophobia.

1368
00:54:48,241 --> 00:54:49,474
I'm scared.

1369
00:54:55,041 --> 00:54:56,907
It was higher than I thought.

1370
00:54:56,907 --> 00:54:58,807
(Will she be able to go on the zip- line safely?)

1371
00:54:58,807 --> 00:55:02,774
(Her mouth is becoming parched)

1372
00:55:03,507 --> 00:55:07,041
(It's their turn to get on the zip-line)

1373
00:55:08,607 --> 00:55:11,241
(They are all set to go)

1374
00:55:13,041 --> 00:55:15,341
It's too high.

1375
00:55:17,207 --> 00:55:18,374
This is scary.

1376
00:55:18,374 --> 00:55:20,341
I told you that it was scary.

1377
00:55:20,341 --> 00:55:22,107
It's really scary right before it starts.

1378
00:55:22,107 --> 00:55:23,507
Especially when the door opens.

1379
00:55:23,674 --> 00:55:24,841
(Surprised)

1380
00:55:25,607 --> 00:55:26,707
(Her heart is about to burst before she takes off)

1381
00:55:27,641 --> 00:55:29,007
- Oh, my. / - But...

1382
00:55:30,407 --> 00:55:32,241
(Snaps)

1383
00:55:32,241 --> 00:55:37,807
(They take off the moment they were unguarded)

1384
00:55:40,241 --> 00:55:47,407
(They move forward towards Niagara Falls)

1385
00:55:47,407 --> 00:55:49,707
It's really refreshing.

1386
00:55:53,041 --> 00:55:55,607
(They dart off without hesitation)

1387
00:55:55,607 --> 00:55:58,441
It felt so nice and cool.

1388
00:55:58,874 --> 00:56:01,441
Oh, my God. Can you see the view?

1389
00:56:03,741 --> 00:56:06,474
- Wow. / - It's Niagara Falls.

1390
00:56:06,474 --> 00:56:07,574
(The vast Niagara Falls is spread out before them)

1391
00:56:07,874 --> 00:56:11,374
(The magnificent view makes them forget their fear)

1392
00:56:11,441 --> 00:56:12,974
Oh, my God. The waterfall is so near.

1393
00:56:12,974 --> 00:56:16,841
It's splashing water on us.

1394
00:56:19,274 --> 00:56:20,541
Hello.

1395
00:56:20,941 --> 00:56:22,007
That looks so fun.

1396
00:56:22,007 --> 00:56:23,541
- Oh, my God. / - Hear the sound of the wind.

1397
00:56:23,541 --> 00:56:26,141
(Experiencing Niagara Falls with their entire bodies)

1398
00:56:26,707 --> 00:56:27,741
We're almost there.

1399
00:56:27,841 --> 00:56:28,974
It's short.

1400
00:56:29,774 --> 00:56:31,007

1402
00:56:34,074 --> 00:56:35,574

1404
00:56:42,507 --> 00:56:45,741
(Excited, sad that it ended)

1405
00:56:45,741 --> 00:56:46,774
(The Niagara zip-line was short but intense)

You get sprayed by a natural mist

1409
00:56:52,107 --> 00:56:53,441
while you come down.

1410

1411
00:56:55,174 --> 00:56:56,874
But it was so strong...

- I couldn't open my eyes. / - You get sprayed a lot?

1413
00:56:58,907 --> 00:57:00,274
Yes, I got sprayed a lot.

1414

1417
00:57:08,041 --> 00:57:10,474
- Made me cheerful. / - Are you happy now?

1418
00:57:10,474 --> 00:57:12,641
There's a cruise that will take us right to the falls.

1419

- Yes. / - The blue ones represent the U.S.

1445

How did you know that?

1447
00:58:33,141 --> 00:58:34,407
- I asked earlier. / - But...

1448
00:58:34,407 --> 00:58:35,441
- I asked in English. / - Really?

- Did you ask in English? / - Of course.

1450
00:58:37,774 --> 00:58:39,007
Smart.

1451

Honggi, if you like exciting things,

1452
00:58:42,274 --> 00:58:45,107
you don't have to wear the raincoat.

1453
00:58:45,107 --> 00:58:46,274
(Okay, I won't wear it)

1454
00:58:46,274 --> 00:58:47,374
Let's not wear it.

1455

- We came all the way here. / - I don't like exciting.

1457

We have to get sprayed by natural mist.

1458

Why would you wear a raincoat?

1459
00:58:56,807 --> 00:58:58,607
Okay, I also won't wear it.

1460

(Excited)

1467
00:59:20,774 --> 00:59:22,607
- You both aren't wearing raincoats. / - Yes.

1468
00:59:22,607 --> 00:59:23,807
There's a reason why they're all wearing raincoats.

1469
00:59:23,807 --> 00:59:26,707
- There's a reason why. / - Of course.

1470

I feel like we're about to get sucked in the waterfall.

1479
00:59:58,574 --> 00:59:59,641
It's amazing.

- This is the U.S. waterfall. / - Yes, the U.S. one.

1488

around the U.S. waterfalls.

1494

Did you enjoy the mist?

1508
01:01:16,341 --> 01:01:17,941
It's like when you take a shower

1509
01:01:17,941 --> 01:01:19,841
and the hose breaks and sprays your face.

That waterfall looks like a horseshoe,

so it's named Horseshoe Falls.

1548
01:03:02,974 --> 01:03:03,441

01:04:17,674 --> 01:04:19,474
This isn't...

1572
01:04:19,474 --> 01:04:21,741
(I don't think this is)

1573
01:04:25,241 --> 01:04:28,441
- You were wearing it alone. / - I was very nervous.

1574
01:04:28,441 --> 01:04:30,041
I didn't want to get caught.

1575
01:04:30,841 --> 01:04:32,974
(Why is Hyorim wearing a raincoat?)

1576
01:04:33,341 --> 01:04:36,441
(What is going on?)

1577
01:04:37,641 --> 01:04:41,307
(She snuck a raincoat without telling Honggi)

1578
01:04:41,974 --> 01:04:43,841
(Honggi was getting ready to face the waterfalls)

1579
01:04:43,841 --> 01:04:45,374
She's putting it on alone.

1580
01:04:47,241 --> 01:04:48,707
I was so nervous.

1581
01:04:48,707 --> 01:04:51,041
(She managed to put it on)

1582
01:04:53,074 --> 01:04:54,741
Honggi, be careful.

1583
01:04:54,741 --> 01:04:56,607
(He feels betrayed)

1584
01:04:57,274 --> 01:04:58,307
Come here.

1585
01:04:58,941 --> 01:05:00,874
- Come over here. / - No!

1586
01:05:05,641 --> 01:05:07,274
You tore it all up.

1587
01:05:08,374 --> 01:05:11,041
Look at this. You tore it.

1588
01:05:11,041 --> 01:05:13,641
It's pointless to wear this.

1589
01:05:14,241 --> 01:05:15,941
They really are like siblings.

1590
01:05:16,741 --> 01:05:18,241
What do you think? Is it extreme?

1591
01:05:18,241 --> 01:05:20,041
(Do you think it's an extreme activity?)

1592
01:05:20,041 --> 01:05:21,674
It's an activity.

1593
01:05:21,674 --> 01:05:23,841
(He strongly agrees)

1594
01:05:25,041 --> 01:05:28,841
(The waterfall meets their eyes)

1595
01:05:31,907 --> 01:05:34,207
You must go there at least once.

1596
01:05:34,207 --> 01:05:39,007
(Niagara Falls is just amazing)

1597
01:05:54,407 --> 01:05:55,707
Let's take a selfie.

1598
01:05:55,707 --> 01:05:57,841
(They take a selfie with the waterfall)

1599
01:05:57,841 --> 01:05:59,174
- Can we take a selfie with this? / - Yes.

1600
01:05:59,174 --> 01:06:01,074
How does it work? We don't even have the selfie stick.

1601
01:06:01,074 --> 01:06:03,074
We're just shooting a video.

1602
01:06:03,407 --> 01:06:05,707
(The cruise goes back after 30 minutes)

1603
01:06:05,707 --> 01:06:07,874
- It must've been sad to leave. / - It was.

1604
01:06:07,874 --> 01:06:09,041
Gosh, I'm so cold.

1605
01:06:09,741 --> 01:06:11,974
I got too cocky and I'm so cold now.

1606
01:06:12,207 --> 01:06:13,241
And I'm hungry.

1607
01:06:14,774 --> 01:06:15,807
Let's eat.

1608
01:06:15,941 --> 01:06:17,974
Okay. Let's go eat.

1609
01:06:18,541 --> 01:06:19,607
Let's go.

1610
01:06:19,607 --> 01:06:22,641
(Off to their last Niagara stop)

1611
01:06:26,607 --> 01:06:28,241
(Killing Day in Mother Nature of Canada)

1612
01:06:28,241 --> 01:06:30,574
(Dinner)

1613
01:06:30,574 --> 01:06:33,174
This is the last way to enjoy

1614
01:06:33,174 --> 01:06:35,274
our time at the Niagara Falls.

1615
01:06:35,441 --> 01:06:37,341
(A restaurant located near Niagara Falls)

1616
01:06:37,341 --> 01:06:38,974
- Isn't it cool? / - Because of that...

1617
01:06:38,974 --> 01:06:40,641
- It looks like the White House. / - I was so...

1618
01:06:40,641 --> 01:06:41,907
Impressed with Hyorim.

1619
01:06:42,474 --> 01:06:46,474
(The day at Niagara Falls is coming to an end)

1620
01:06:46,474 --> 01:06:47,741
This is nice.

1621
01:06:48,574 --> 01:06:51,274
- We can have dinner watching the falls? / - Yes.

1622
01:06:51,274 --> 01:06:53,174
- I can see it so well from here. / - Right?

1623
01:06:53,174 --> 01:06:55,674
They have night lights on at the waterfalls.

1624
01:06:56,274 --> 01:06:57,441
(Niagara Falls lights up in many colors at night)

1625
01:06:57,441 --> 01:07:00,074
- It lights up. / - And the color changes.

1626
01:07:01,341 --> 01:07:04,641
It'll be so romantic if you go there with your lover.

1627
01:07:04,641 --> 01:07:06,507
- You can eat with the waterfall. / - It looks amazing.

1628
01:07:06,507 --> 01:07:08,041
It's so beautiful.

1629
01:07:08,507 --> 01:07:10,974
(Excited)

1630
01:07:10,974 --> 01:07:13,774
- And there's music playing. / - There was a live band.

1631
01:07:14,074 --> 01:07:16,974
Plus, they played all my favorite rock songs.

1632
01:07:17,241 --> 01:07:18,174
He's totally different from when

1633
01:07:18,174 --> 01:07:19,474
he was in Sault Ste. Marie.

1634
01:07:19,474 --> 01:07:22,407
(The little brother is just excited)

1635
01:07:22,841 --> 01:07:24,574
I love this place.

1636
01:07:24,574 --> 01:07:25,674
(100% satisfied)

1637
01:07:26,007 --> 01:07:27,174
Where's our food?

1638
01:07:27,774 --> 01:07:28,774
It'll be here soon.

1639
01:07:28,774 --> 01:07:29,774
(I'm hungry)

1640
01:07:30,441 --> 01:07:34,441
(The food is finally served)

1641
01:07:34,441 --> 01:07:35,474
Oh, my God.

1642
01:07:38,074 --> 01:07:40,807
(The best dinner at Niagara Falls)

1643
01:07:40,807 --> 01:07:42,807
Goodness.

1644
01:07:43,474 --> 01:07:46,474
In this restaurant, anything would taste good.

1645
01:07:46,474 --> 01:07:50,807
(The dishes are as beautiful as the waterfall)

1646
01:07:51,274 --> 01:07:52,407
What's that?

1647
01:07:53,274 --> 01:07:54,974
(Pork ribs, salmon steak, grilled chicken)

1648
01:07:54,974 --> 01:07:55,707
(Bread with cheese, all for $93)

1649
01:07:55,707 --> 01:07:58,074
Thank you for the food.

1650
01:07:58,107 --> 01:08:01,274
I think that's pork ribs.

1651
01:08:01,474 --> 01:08:03,107
- Pork ribs. / - Is it pork?

1652
01:08:03,107 --> 01:08:04,307
Oh, my God. Like this?

1653
01:08:04,974 --> 01:08:07,641
We had beef yesterday, we're having pork today.

1654
01:08:08,274 --> 01:08:11,374
(Dipping it in a sauce)

1655
01:08:11,374 --> 01:08:12,574
Oh, my God. Like this?

1656
01:08:13,174 --> 01:08:16,841
(He takes a big bite)

1657
01:08:16,841 --> 01:08:19,041
This is strawberry jam.

1658
01:08:19,507 --> 01:08:21,507
- Really? / - Yes.

1659
01:08:22,441 --> 01:08:23,474
It's not good.

1660
01:08:24,207 --> 01:08:27,074
- Strawberry jam? / - Pork with strawberry jam?

1661
01:08:27,074 --> 01:08:28,974
It tastes just like strawberry jam.

1662
01:08:28,974 --> 01:08:31,941
The pork ribs didn't taste good with the sauce.

1663
01:08:31,941 --> 01:08:33,874
- You don't like sweet things. / - Right.

1664
01:08:37,107 --> 01:08:40,041
(It's not to Honggi's taste)

1665
01:08:40,907 --> 01:08:45,141
(Hyorim tastes the salmon steak)

1666
01:08:46,141 --> 01:08:48,474
- This is good. / - What's that?

1667
01:08:48,707 --> 01:08:52,474
(Perfect harmony of tender salmon and savory sauce)

1668
01:08:54,674 --> 01:08:56,974
(It's really good)

1669
01:08:57,507 --> 01:08:59,274
(Is this good?)

1670
01:08:59,274 --> 01:09:00,607
Cheese and bread.

1671
01:09:01,907 --> 01:09:02,907
Let me try.

1672
01:09:03,774 --> 01:09:09,241
(A perfect combination of cheese and bread)

1673
01:09:09,241 --> 01:09:11,874
It must be really good.

1674
01:09:11,874 --> 01:09:14,241
- It looks delicious. / - Wendy loves it.

1675
01:09:15,507 --> 01:09:18,574
- Wendy knows how it tastes. / - It looks so good.

1676
01:09:19,107 --> 01:09:20,207
It must be good.

1677
01:09:20,207 --> 01:09:22,141
(Cheese and bread, $10.80)

1678
01:09:22,307 --> 01:09:23,874
- What is this? / - Do you like cheese?

1679
01:09:24,307 --> 01:09:26,174
- I love cheese. / - You do?

1680
01:09:29,007 --> 01:09:33,241
(But she feels nervous even before he tries it)

1681
01:09:33,241 --> 01:09:34,607
Making me look bad.

1682
01:09:35,841 --> 01:09:38,607
(He takes a big bite)

1683
01:09:39,474 --> 01:09:40,741
It looks delicious.

1684
01:09:42,474 --> 01:09:43,941
Do you want me to eat it?

1685
01:09:46,041 --> 01:09:50,541
The bread goes with this jam.

1686
01:09:53,941 --> 01:09:55,241
He went all the way to Canada

1687
01:09:55,241 --> 01:09:56,941
to eat bread with strawberry jam.

1688
01:09:58,274 --> 01:10:02,107
(Honggi doesn't like the cheese and bread either)

1689
01:10:11,507 --> 01:10:13,174
I loved it.

1690
01:10:13,907 --> 01:10:15,907
It's crispy. I like it.

1691
01:10:17,207 --> 01:10:19,574
It's crispy but not too hard.

1692
01:10:19,574 --> 01:10:21,707
(Perfect combination of soft bread and cheese)

1693
01:10:21,707 --> 01:10:23,207
This is so good.

1694
01:10:25,707 --> 01:10:30,174
(I like it a lot)

1695
01:10:30,241 --> 01:10:32,074
You really don't like the same foods.

1696
01:10:32,074 --> 01:10:34,741
We have totally different tastes. Completely different.

1697
01:10:35,474 --> 01:10:37,907
(They have the ace in the hole)

1698
01:10:37,907 --> 01:10:39,674
But you just need to feed Honggi meat.

1699
01:10:39,674 --> 01:10:42,674
(It's the taste you can't resist, chicken)

1700
01:10:43,574 --> 01:10:46,407
(Grilled chicken, $26.70)

1701
01:10:46,841 --> 01:10:48,174
(Dancing like a chicken out of joy)

1702
01:10:48,174 --> 01:10:50,707
He loves chicken.

1703
01:10:50,707 --> 01:10:52,241
Come on, chicken.

1704
01:10:52,474 --> 01:10:56,141
(What does the chicken taste like?)

1705
01:10:56,407 --> 01:10:58,907
(He takes a big bite)

1706
01:10:58,907 --> 01:11:00,507
(Hesitant)

1707
01:11:00,507 --> 01:11:02,574
- What's wrong? / - Why?

1708
01:11:02,574 --> 01:11:05,874
- Oh, no. / - It has to be good.

1709
01:11:06,407 --> 01:11:09,374
(Smiling)

1710
01:11:09,607 --> 01:11:11,107
It's good.

1711
01:11:11,807 --> 01:11:12,807
What a relief.

1712
01:11:13,307 --> 01:11:17,341
(Chicken is always good)

1713
01:11:17,341 --> 01:11:19,074
It has cheese in it.

1714
01:11:19,107 --> 01:11:21,807
- Do you like cheese? / - I love cheese.

1715
01:11:22,807 --> 01:11:25,907
(He likes the combination)

1716
01:11:27,174 --> 01:11:32,174
(He focuses on the chicken)

1717
01:11:34,041 --> 01:11:37,474
People don't really come here for the food.

1718
01:11:37,474 --> 01:11:38,641
They come for the view.

1719
01:11:40,407 --> 01:11:42,441
The food is good though.

1720
01:11:42,441 --> 01:11:44,774
(When they're about to finish their meal)

1721
01:11:45,707 --> 01:11:48,241
Gosh, you startled me. What happened?

1722
01:11:48,307 --> 01:11:49,541
- Why? / - What's wrong?

1723
01:11:49,874 --> 01:11:51,207
I was so startled.

1724
01:11:52,607 --> 01:11:57,507
Gosh, you startled me. What happened?

1725
01:11:59,174 --> 01:12:01,841
- My goodness. / - It was amazing.

1726
01:12:01,841 --> 01:12:02,841
Gosh.

1727
01:12:05,607 --> 01:12:10,741
(Hyorim's last gift at Niagara Falls)

1728
01:12:13,341 --> 01:12:14,841
It looks amazing.

1729
01:12:14,841 --> 01:12:19,441
(Magnificent fireworks light up the falls)

1730
01:12:21,407 --> 01:12:22,774
It's beautiful.

1731
01:12:23,541 --> 01:12:29,341
(They watch in awe)

1732
01:12:36,607 --> 01:12:39,707
- It was amazing. / - It's beautiful.

1733
01:12:39,707 --> 01:12:42,707
(The fireworks fill the night sky with beautiful colors)

1734
01:12:42,707 --> 01:12:44,407
It's been a long time since I watched fireworks

1735
01:12:44,407 --> 01:12:45,541
so close up.

1736
01:12:45,541 --> 01:12:46,841
Me too.

1737
01:12:48,974 --> 01:12:52,507
(The beautiful fireworks open out before their eyes)

1738
01:12:54,574 --> 01:12:56,174
This is wonderful.

1739
01:13:01,374 --> 01:13:03,341
This is the best place.

1740
01:13:03,341 --> 01:13:06,974
(Niagara Falls gives them unforgettable memories)

1741
01:13:06,974 --> 01:13:08,074
Take the cruise to see the falls,

1742
01:13:08,074 --> 01:13:10,774
then enjoy dinner with fireworks.

1743
01:13:10,774 --> 01:13:13,041
- This is the course. / - Right.

1744
01:13:14,107 --> 01:13:15,874
You should go there with a lover.

1745
01:13:16,674 --> 01:13:19,841
Niagara Falls look even more beautiful with the lights.

1746
01:13:23,641 --> 01:13:26,707
- It's wonderful. / - It's so beautiful.

1747
01:13:27,274 --> 01:13:32,607
(The therapeutic killing day comes to an end)

1748
01:13:33,007 --> 01:13:34,107
(But the real charm of Canada begins now)

1749
01:13:34,107 --> 01:13:36,207
- The real charm begins now. / - Really?

1750
01:13:36,907 --> 01:13:39,141
- Did you enjoy it? Let's go. / - Yes.

1751
01:13:39,141 --> 01:13:40,674
Let's go!

1752
01:13:40,674 --> 01:13:42,807
(Small towns in Canada)

1753
01:13:44,174 --> 01:13:47,774
They are small towns unknown to Koreans.

1754
01:13:47,774 --> 01:13:48,841
(Fascinating cities in Ontario)

1755
01:13:49,674 --> 01:13:51,374
- Things are cute. / - It's pretty.

1756
01:13:51,374 --> 01:13:55,874
It was heavily influenced by the U.K.

1757
01:13:55,874 --> 01:13:59,041
- It does look different. / - It's called Thousand Islands.

1758
01:13:59,041 --> 01:14:01,374
They call this place Thousand Islands.

1759
01:14:01,607 --> 01:14:03,774
It actually has 1,800 islands.

1760
01:14:08,541 --> 01:14:10,541
They froze it in the ice.

1761
01:14:12,341 --> 01:14:14,407
This is it. This is what I like.

1762
01:14:14,407 --> 01:14:16,041
(They fall in love with it)

1763
01:14:16,274 --> 01:14:22,807
(Excited, loud, lively)

1764
01:14:23,774 --> 01:14:25,474
Honggi came back to life.

1765
01:14:25,474 --> 01:14:27,807
(Please look forward to the Canadian small city tour)

1766
01:14:29,541 --> 01:14:31,774
- As expected. / - Niagara Falls.

1767
01:14:31,774 --> 01:14:33,141
- Niagara Falls is the best. / - What an amazing sight.

1768
01:14:33,141 --> 01:14:36,307
People must go there at least once in their lifetime.

1769
01:14:36,307 --> 01:14:37,274
- That's right. / - For real.

1770
01:14:37,274 --> 01:14:39,007
Doesn't it make you feel cool just by watching?

1771
01:14:39,007 --> 01:14:39,974
Even if it costs more money,

1772
01:14:39,974 --> 01:14:41,507
taking the boat is a must, right?

1773
01:14:41,507 --> 01:14:44,207
But the actual cruise wasn't

1774
01:14:44,207 --> 01:14:45,641
as expensive as expected.

1775
01:14:45,641 --> 01:14:47,107
It was about $20.

1776
01:14:47,107 --> 01:14:49,241
It is about $20.

1777
01:14:49,241 --> 01:14:52,541
If I had to choose between the zip-line or cruise,

1778
01:14:52,541 --> 01:14:55,241
the cruise is more cost effective.

1779
01:14:55,241 --> 01:14:58,141
You experience more on the cruise.

1780
01:14:58,141 --> 01:15:00,074
Isn't the zip-line expensive?

1781
01:15:00,074 --> 01:15:01,974
Yes, it was more expensive than I expected.

1782
01:15:01,974 --> 01:15:04,574
It's better to go during a warmer season, right?

1783
01:15:04,574 --> 01:15:05,241
That's right.

1784
01:15:05,241 --> 01:15:08,607
It's nice if you go in September or October.

1785
01:15:08,607 --> 01:15:10,574
- Go there in September. / - September or October.

1786
01:15:10,574 --> 01:15:11,907
- Before it gets cold? / - Yes.

1787
01:15:11,907 --> 01:15:14,407
Prepare slowly after watching this show.

1788
01:15:14,407 --> 01:15:16,474
- I think you should make reservations now. / - Yes.

1789
01:15:16,707 --> 01:15:17,374
Okay.

1790
01:15:17,374 --> 01:15:20,774
Would you like to go to Niagara Falls in Canada

1791
01:15:20,774 --> 01:15:23,207
according to the Realistic Sibling Tour?

1792
01:15:23,207 --> 01:15:24,841
Please vote.

1793

1794

(What will the judges choose?)

1795
01:15:33,707 --> 01:15:36,641
Okay, only the opposite team...

1796
01:15:36,641 --> 01:15:38,641
- Can see the results now. / - I'm curious.

1797
01:15:38,874 --> 01:15:42,341
- Their faces... / - We'll give hints with our faces.

1798
01:15:42,341 --> 01:15:44,341
- You'll act, won't you? / - We'll see it first.

1799
01:15:44,341 --> 01:15:46,241
Didn't it look really fun?

1800
01:15:46,241 --> 01:15:48,474
The results were reflected on Sikyung's glasses.

1801
01:15:48,774 --> 01:15:50,541
- It's higher than expected. / - Yes.

1802
01:15:50,741 --> 01:15:53,074
I was expecting it in the 70's but it's over 80.

1803
01:15:54,041 --> 01:15:55,841
- That's right. / - It's reflected on his glasses.

1804
01:15:55,841 --> 01:15:57,074
Is it 92 votes?

1805
01:15:57,507 --> 01:15:58,907
Is it 92 votes?

1806
01:15:59,707 --> 01:16:00,741
I think they might cry.

1807
01:16:00,741 --> 01:16:03,607
In my opinion, we can win

1808
01:16:03,607 --> 01:16:05,407
just by drinking beer in Austria.

1809
01:16:06,107 --> 01:16:07,707
- Do you want to see? / - No.

1810
01:16:07,707 --> 01:16:09,074
The last number is either 8 or 9, isn't it?

1811
01:16:09,074 --> 01:16:12,341
- This is the result of your action. / - I'm surprised.

1812
01:16:14,007 --> 01:16:16,474
(67 votes)

1813
01:16:16,474 --> 01:16:17,774
That's a lot of votes.

1814
01:16:18,307 --> 01:16:20,141
I really didn't think...

1815
01:16:20,141 --> 01:16:22,674
- They would do that. / - Their reactions...

1816
01:16:23,041 --> 01:16:24,274
The results must be low.

1817
01:16:24,774 --> 01:16:26,607
- No. / - No.

1818
01:16:26,607 --> 01:16:28,241
- Trust me. / - No.

1819
01:16:28,241 --> 01:16:29,874
I think it's higher than our expectations.

1820
01:16:29,874 --> 01:16:32,107
- No, it's not over yet. / - Calm down.

1821

Please look forward

1825
01:16:39,474 --> 01:16:42,341

1827
01:16:45,041 --> 01:16:46,207
(The country where people want to live, Austria)

1828
01:16:46,207 --> 01:16:47,941
It's so pretty.

(Their trip is so juicy)

1833
01:17:03,107 --> 01:17:04,707
Let's eat then.

1834
01:17:06,341 --> 01:17:07,207
It's good.

1835
01:17:07,207 --> 01:17:09,607
I think Austria is a place we can make

1836
01:17:09,607 --> 01:17:11,007
all our fantasies come true.

1837
01:17:11,007 --> 01:17:12,841
Let's come back with our members next time.
