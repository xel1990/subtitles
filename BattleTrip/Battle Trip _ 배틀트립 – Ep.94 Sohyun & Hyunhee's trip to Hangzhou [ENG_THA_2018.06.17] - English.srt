(Numerous great tips on trips)

00:00:06,573 --> 00:00:08,240
(Kim Sook, Sung Sikyung)

3
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:10,073
(Lee Hwijae)

4
00:00:11,273 --> 00:00:12,673
(Special host, Kim Minkyoung)

5
00:00:13,607 --> 00:00:16,773
Travel is war. Battle Trip!

6
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:22,540
- She's finally here. / - Right, everyone.

7
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:25,840
Today's special host is Kim Minkyoung. Welcome.

8
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:27,507
Welcome.

9
00:00:29,373 --> 00:00:30,840
It's nice to meet you.

10
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:32,707
I feel nervous to be here.

11
00:00:32,707 --> 00:00:34,307
Really? Why are you nervous?

12
00:00:34,307 --> 00:00:36,273
Since this is a food show...

13
00:00:36,273 --> 00:00:38,407
- No, it's not a food show. I'm sorry. / - Travel show.

14
00:00:38,407 --> 00:00:40,240
- Travel show. / - We're not a food show.

15
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:41,340
There are a lot of food though.

16
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:45,107
About 80% of the trips are about food.

17
00:00:45,107 --> 00:00:46,140
So I thought,

18
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:48,140
I wouldn't be able to...

19
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:49,207
You might run out.

20
00:00:49,207 --> 00:00:51,107
Host the show on an empty stomach.

21
00:00:51,107 --> 00:00:52,907
- So I made sure to eat a lot. / - You did?

22
00:00:52,907 --> 00:00:55,073
Since yesterday, I've eaten a lot.

23
00:00:55,073 --> 00:00:56,440
This show makes me feel hungry.

24
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:59,173
You know what? Today, there will be

25
00:00:59,173 --> 00:01:00,973
a fish dish that you've never seen or heard of.

26
00:01:00,973 --> 00:01:03,807
And a meat dish that you can't even see sober.

27
00:01:03,807 --> 00:01:04,740
A meat dish?

28
00:01:04,740 --> 00:01:05,940
What should I do?

29
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:09,373
Once you hear about the destinations,

30
00:01:09,373 --> 00:01:11,007
you'll want to go there to eat.

31
00:01:11,873 --> 00:01:13,073
They are two prominent countries with great food.

32
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:15,140
- I just can't wait. / - Where would that be?

33
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:17,573
We are nearing our 100th episode.

34
00:01:17,573 --> 00:01:18,540
Already.

35
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:21,273
When we started this show,

36
00:01:21,273 --> 00:01:24,973
we saw high ratings with this theme.

37
00:01:24,973 --> 00:01:27,140
And it continues even now.

38
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:29,940
- It was literally on fire. / - What is it? I'm so curious.

39
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:32,107
- It is... / - What is it?

40
00:01:32,107 --> 00:01:35,007
Counterattack of Secondary Travel Destinations.

41
00:01:35,007 --> 00:01:38,707
- So this is Part 2. / - We'll start Part 2 today.

42
00:01:38,707 --> 00:01:41,173
In Part 1, we went to...

43
00:01:41,173 --> 00:01:42,907
You all know Bangkok in Thailand.

44
00:01:42,907 --> 00:01:46,207
But Kim Minkyo went to Pattaya instead.

45
00:01:46,207 --> 00:01:48,307
He was like a native.

46
00:01:48,307 --> 00:01:49,140
He really was.

47
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:51,140
- And we went to... / - Macao.

48
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:52,873
Macao instead of Hong Kong.

49
00:01:52,873 --> 00:01:56,440
I went to the famous restaurant in Macao.

50
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:59,540
There was such a queue. I had to wait for 2 hours,

51
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:02,273
but the food was still good.

52
00:02:02,273 --> 00:02:04,173
- I'm so envious. / - About what?

53
00:02:04,173 --> 00:02:06,240
She must've had a lot of good food.

54
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,140
Aren't you full?

55
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:09,740
- No. I'm hungry again. / - So soon?

56
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:10,573
Yes, I'm so hungry.

57
00:02:10,573 --> 00:02:12,073
You said you've eaten since yesterday.

58
00:02:12,073 --> 00:02:13,707
But you're already hungry again?

59
00:02:13,707 --> 00:02:15,773
My stomach becomes empty when I talk about food.

60
00:02:15,773 --> 00:02:17,473
It gets all digested.

61
00:02:17,473 --> 00:02:19,040
It'll be so hard to watch the video.

62
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:22,573
I hope today's trip designers...

63
00:02:22,573 --> 00:02:24,107
- Will go to the countries of delicacies. / - Right.

64
00:02:24,107 --> 00:02:25,207
Where are they going?

65
00:02:25,207 --> 00:02:28,607
Counterattack of Secondary Travel Destinations 2.

66
00:02:28,607 --> 00:02:30,340
Where are they going?

67
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:32,173
Let's meet today's trip designers.

68
00:02:32,173 --> 00:02:34,007
Please come on up.

69
00:02:38,507 --> 00:02:40,240
(Kim Shinyoung, Mimi of OH MY GIRL)

70
00:02:41,607 --> 00:02:43,573
(Park Sohyun, Hong Hyunhee)

71
00:02:45,107 --> 00:02:48,307
Sohyun went to Jeonju last time.

72
00:02:48,307 --> 00:02:50,340
- With me. / - She had one of the highest scores.

73
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:52,573
Right. It's still in the top 5.

74
00:02:52,573 --> 00:02:55,340
Actually, she is famous for being a picky eater.

75
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:56,740
- I don't eat a lot. / - I know.

76
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:58,707
But you got a high score.

77
00:02:58,707 --> 00:03:00,173
Sohyun is a little unique though.

78
00:03:00,173 --> 00:03:03,007
Her appetite differs depending on her partner.

79
00:03:03,007 --> 00:03:05,207
When she went on a trip with me, she rarely ate.

80
00:03:05,207 --> 00:03:06,007
- Yes. / - Really?

81
00:03:06,007 --> 00:03:09,440
I had good food though. It was fun.

82
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,340
Wait.

83
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:12,107
- You didn't eat a lot during this trip? / - Wait.

84
00:03:12,107 --> 00:03:14,507
We won!

85
00:03:19,573 --> 00:03:22,240
In fact, Sohyun is the mother of idols.

86
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,007
Is there a reason you chose Hyunhee?

87
00:03:24,007 --> 00:03:26,307
Hyunhee has been a guest

88
00:03:26,307 --> 00:03:29,573
on my radio show for about 2 to 3 years.

89
00:03:29,573 --> 00:03:31,107
- She's family. / - It's actually 5 years.

90
00:03:31,107 --> 00:03:32,173
5 years...

91
00:03:32,173 --> 00:03:34,207
She doesn't even remember.

92
00:03:35,373 --> 00:03:36,973
- This is disappointing. / - She has no idea.

93
00:03:36,973 --> 00:03:38,173
She just loses half of her memories.

94
00:03:38,173 --> 00:03:39,373
Please understand.

95
00:03:39,373 --> 00:03:40,740
That's why she's still young.

96
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:42,673
I'll go again.

97
00:03:42,673 --> 00:03:45,473
Do what again?

98
00:03:45,473 --> 00:03:46,207
I'm about to cry.

99
00:03:46,207 --> 00:03:47,373
Hyunhee has been a guest

100
00:03:47,373 --> 00:03:49,507
on my radio show for 5 years.

101
00:03:49,507 --> 00:03:52,407
Lee Gookju used to do it

102
00:03:52,407 --> 00:03:53,940
and she became too successful.

103
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:56,340
Then Park Narae filled in for her

104
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:58,807
and she became successful again.

105
00:03:58,807 --> 00:04:00,407
And Hyunhee has been filling in since.

106
00:04:00,407 --> 00:04:01,573
It's a seat to success.

107
00:04:01,573 --> 00:04:04,573
She always says I'll be successful

108
00:04:04,573 --> 00:04:07,207
and she will give me three chances.

109
00:04:07,207 --> 00:04:09,107
"Happy Together" was one of them,

110
00:04:09,107 --> 00:04:11,373
but it didn't go well.

111
00:04:11,373 --> 00:04:12,307
Here we go.

112
00:04:12,307 --> 00:04:12,573
What about the 2nd chance?

113
00:04:12,573 --> 00:04:14,573
My 2nd chance is Battle Trip.

114
00:04:14,573 --> 00:04:15,540
This is your second chance?

115
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:18,707
She cares about me more than my CEO does.

116
00:04:18,707 --> 00:04:21,940
So I tried my best with my specialty and sincerity.

117
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:24,540
- She'll show the audience who she is. / - Right.

118
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:27,740
Meanwhile, Shinyoung picked Mimi.

119
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:31,173
I went to Taiwan with Shin Dong before.

120
00:04:31,173 --> 00:04:33,207
We toured Taiwan.

121
00:04:33,207 --> 00:04:37,607
But I chose Mimi because of the language.

122
00:04:37,607 --> 00:04:38,240
She speaks a foreign language?

123
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,340
She speaks very well. You'll be surprised.

124
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:40,940
- Really? / - Which language?

125
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:42,207
- Language genius. / - She speaks Japanese?

126
00:04:42,207 --> 00:04:43,607
She speaks very good Japanese.

127
00:04:43,607 --> 00:04:46,107
- I speak Japanese a little. / - You speak Japanese.

128
00:04:46,107 --> 00:04:47,407
I speak a little.

129
00:04:47,407 --> 00:04:49,040
But she's like a native.

130
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,340
Let's find out where they went.

131
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:51,507
Let's do that.

132
00:04:51,507 --> 00:04:55,073
Sohyun and Hyunhee, where did you go?

133
00:04:55,073 --> 00:04:57,707
If heaven is in the sky,

134
00:04:57,707 --> 00:04:59,407
we have this place on Earth.

135
00:04:59,407 --> 00:05:02,807
We went to Hangzhou in China.

136
00:05:02,807 --> 00:05:04,007
Hangzhou.

137
00:05:04,973 --> 00:05:07,507
Now that they went to Hangzhou...

138
00:05:07,507 --> 00:05:09,473
- We're more likely to win. / - Right.

139
00:05:09,473 --> 00:05:12,273
- The place has a lot of good foods. / - Exactly.

140
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:14,640
And there's Su Dongpo,

141
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:16,573
a Chinese writer.

142
00:05:16,573 --> 00:05:17,740
Do you know Dongpo pork?

143
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:19,873
It's Su Dongpo's favorite dish.

144
00:05:19,873 --> 00:05:21,240
That's why it's called that.

145
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:23,140
And it started in Hangzhou.

146
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:24,040
My head aches.

147
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:26,973
Hangzhou is the home of the Dongpo pork.

148
00:05:26,973 --> 00:05:29,240
- The food in Hangzhou is... / - Is it different?

149
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,407
- It's totally different. / - It's different.

150
00:05:30,407 --> 00:05:32,407
I fought with her as it was served in small portions.

151
00:05:32,407 --> 00:05:33,573
- It was small? / - It was so small.

152
00:05:33,573 --> 00:05:35,740
- It was only this much. / - So delicious.

153
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:36,540
That's my portion.

154
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:38,373
Sook would need 8 portions of it.

155
00:05:38,373 --> 00:05:39,307
- Was it good? / - Really?

156
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:42,607
We say there's no difference between bibimbap

157
00:05:42,607 --> 00:05:43,907
in Jeonju and one in Seoul.

158
00:05:43,907 --> 00:05:45,840
- But it tastes better in Jeonju. / - It really does.

159
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,340
It's different from Seoul.

160
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:49,607
So Dongpo pork must be really good there.

161
00:05:49,607 --> 00:05:52,140
- It's the place of origin. / - She's here.

162
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:54,140
- Minkyoung is here. / - She's here.

163
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:55,740
- Do you like Dongpo pork? / - The original.

164
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:57,740
I love it so much.

165
00:05:57,740 --> 00:06:00,873
The thick pork belly marinated in soy sauce.

166
00:06:00,873 --> 00:06:01,740
It's nice and sweet.

167
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:03,107
- Goodness. / - It's like a baby's buttocks.

168
00:06:03,107 --> 00:06:04,540
- That's right. / - So plump.

169
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:06,373
Minkyoung. Don't worry.

170
00:06:06,373 --> 00:06:08,040
Let's ask them.

171
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:08,907
Shinyoung.

172
00:06:08,907 --> 00:06:11,240
Where did you go with Mimi?

173
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:14,473
- It's the country of delicacies. / - Delicacies?

174
00:06:14,473 --> 00:06:17,773
It's a place where we can enjoy Japanese tradition.

175
00:06:18,473 --> 00:06:22,773
- It's Kyoto. / - We've won.

176
00:06:22,773 --> 00:06:24,107
Kyoto!

177
00:06:24,107 --> 00:06:25,207
It's so...

178
00:06:25,207 --> 00:06:27,207
I'm sorry.

179
00:06:28,007 --> 00:06:31,107
So it's Hangzhou vs. Kyoto.

180
00:06:31,107 --> 00:06:34,740
Let's find out where the cities are located.

181
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:36,173
We'll check that out first.

182
00:06:36,173 --> 00:06:37,407
- That's Hangzhou. / - Hangzhou.

183
00:06:37,407 --> 00:06:39,973
It's right below Shanghai.

184
00:06:39,973 --> 00:06:41,340
When you go to China,

185
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:43,540
you'd go to Shanghai or Beijing.

186
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:46,073
Hangzhou isn't a famous city in Korea,

187
00:06:46,073 --> 00:06:49,473
but Chinese people love to go to Hangzhou.

188
00:06:49,473 --> 00:06:52,340
We went there on Labor Day, and it was very nice.

189
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:55,673
While Japan is a famous tourist destination,

190
00:06:55,673 --> 00:06:59,507
we don't know much about China.

191
00:06:59,507 --> 00:07:02,940
If you say you'll go to Hangzhou...

192
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:04,540
No one ever says that, right?

193
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:08,607
- They think it's Guangzhou. / - Guangzhou.

194
00:07:08,607 --> 00:07:11,040
This will be a good lesson.

195
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:13,273
That's another case.

196
00:07:13,273 --> 00:07:15,640
- But you only know limited places in Kyoto. / - Right.

197
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:18,140
When you hear Kyoto, you'd think of familiar places.

198
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:21,007
- Right. / - But you shouldn't think that today.

199
00:07:21,007 --> 00:07:22,173
Not at all.

200
00:07:22,173 --> 00:07:25,573
I captured the hidden sights and flavors

201
00:07:25,573 --> 00:07:26,840
of Kyoto that only I know.

202
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:27,907
How many times have you been to Kyoto?

203
00:07:27,907 --> 00:07:29,873
I've been there almost 30 times.

204
00:07:29,873 --> 00:07:32,240
- She's been so many times. / - She's an expert.

205
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:32,807
She goes so often.

206
00:07:32,807 --> 00:07:36,940
Shinyoung knows Kyoto like Minkyo knows Pattaya.

207
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:38,573
Was it your first time in Hangzhou?

208
00:07:38,573 --> 00:07:41,573
No. I'd been to Hangzhou 10 years ago.

209
00:07:41,573 --> 00:07:43,873
- 10 years ago? / - It's changed so much.

210
00:07:43,873 --> 00:07:45,340
She went 10 years ago.

211
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:48,140
But I didn't really like that city

212
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:49,973
when I went there 10 years ago.

213
00:07:49,973 --> 00:07:52,073
So I didn't expect that much.

214
00:07:52,073 --> 00:07:54,340
But when I went back after 10 years,

215
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:56,873
I was astonished at how much things have changed.

216
00:07:56,873 --> 00:07:59,107
So I really enjoyed the tourist attractions and food.

217
00:07:59,107 --> 00:08:02,807
I'll be able to introduce to you a new Hangzhou.

218
00:08:02,807 --> 00:08:05,173
It's between Kyoto, Japan and Hangzhou, China.

219
00:08:05,173 --> 00:08:08,473
We have our 100 impartial judges

220
00:08:08,473 --> 00:08:09,340
who will vote on today's trips.

221
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:10,607
Nice to meet you.

222
00:08:10,607 --> 00:08:13,673
(100 judges in the audience)

223
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:16,573
She did a big bow.

224
00:08:16,573 --> 00:08:19,373
You can vote once when the trip is over.

225
00:08:19,373 --> 00:08:20,807
Then let's move to Hangzhou first.

226
00:08:20,807 --> 00:08:23,907
Let's watch Toad Tour's trip to Hangzhou.

227
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:28,707
- Sohyun. / - Are you okay, Hyunhee?

228
00:08:29,507 --> 00:08:30,873
I'm not going to receive that.

229
00:08:30,873 --> 00:08:33,340
- I got you an amazing gift. / - Hyunhee.

230
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:36,273
- First, I'm so grateful. / - Hyunhee.

231
00:08:36,273 --> 00:08:38,240
Let me bow to you.

232
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,940
- I mean it. / - Why are you bowing?

233
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:41,773
You got me on the show.

234
00:08:41,773 --> 00:08:43,473
Please stay seated.

235
00:08:46,273 --> 00:08:47,207
Hyunhee...

236
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:51,573
- They're very close. / - Best friends.

237
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:56,973
I always felt a debt to Hyunhee

238
00:08:56,973 --> 00:09:01,373
because I always put a lot of effort in the segments,

239
00:09:01,373 --> 00:09:03,773
but Hyunhee never became popular.

240
00:09:03,773 --> 00:09:06,940
- You're like her mom. / - Yes.

241
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:12,340
I actually want her to get some good fortune

242
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:13,907
and prosper this year,

243
00:09:13,907 --> 00:09:16,873
so I recommended her for this trip.

244
00:09:17,673 --> 00:09:19,840
Open it. It's your gift. You should open it.

245
00:09:21,573 --> 00:09:22,607
What is this? Does this hug me?

246
00:09:22,607 --> 00:09:23,707
- It hugs you. / - Massager?

247
00:09:23,707 --> 00:09:27,940
It will hug you from the back.

248
00:09:28,973 --> 00:09:31,473
Oh, what is this?

249
00:09:31,473 --> 00:09:34,607
- For your skin... / - Oh, soap.

250
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:38,673
- You brought everything in your house. / - Everything.

251
00:09:39,573 --> 00:09:42,540
I'm going to plan a trip for you. Just for you.

252
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:44,440
I told the writers to take a break.

253
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:47,207
I'll take care of it. I know you the best.

254
00:09:47,207 --> 00:09:49,707
- I'll be your guide and plan for everything. / - Really?

255
00:09:49,707 --> 00:09:50,607
When you look at these books,

256
00:09:50,607 --> 00:09:51,107
where do you want to go?

257
00:09:51,107 --> 00:09:54,973
- Shanghai or Osaka? / - Let's take time.

258
00:09:54,973 --> 00:09:57,740
You wanted to go to Osaka.

259
00:09:58,373 --> 00:09:59,973
You know the Prince of Osaka?

260
00:09:59,973 --> 00:10:01,307
He's Yuta.

261
00:10:01,307 --> 00:10:04,407
He's the Prince of Osaka.

262
00:10:04,407 --> 00:10:06,540
- Yuta, Yuta. / - Prince of Osaka.

263
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:08,073
- I know him. / - He's from NCT.

264
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:09,440
Here...

265
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:12,573
The places we can schedule together...

266
00:10:12,573 --> 00:10:14,107
Singapore, Vietnam...

267
00:10:14,107 --> 00:10:16,507
Osaka, Kyoto, Macao, Hong Kong, Bangkok,

268
00:10:16,507 --> 00:10:19,173
Vietnam, Da Nang, Singapore and Kota Kinabalu.

269
00:10:19,173 --> 00:10:21,940
I've been to Tokyo and Fukuoka, Japan.

270
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:24,507
But I've never been to China in my life.

271
00:10:24,507 --> 00:10:26,773
- Many people have never been to China. / - Right.

272
00:10:26,773 --> 00:10:29,107
I think it's been 10 years since I've been to China.

273
00:10:29,107 --> 00:10:32,007
- I went there with my mother. / - With your family?

274
00:10:32,007 --> 00:10:34,607
My mom didn't really like it.

275
00:10:34,607 --> 00:10:36,040
It's hard for the elders.

276
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:38,540
- If you like the food, it's paradise. / - Too much walking.

277
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:42,273
Hangzhou is the city young people visit the most...

278
00:10:42,273 --> 00:10:45,940
- After Beijing and Shanghai. / - Really?

279
00:10:47,273 --> 00:10:50,907
(Hangzhou)

280
00:10:50,907 --> 00:10:53,007
So nice.

281
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:58,073
- It has both the city and the traditions. / - So nice.

282
00:10:58,073 --> 00:10:59,807
- Look at the night view. / - Isn't that Las Vegas?

283
00:10:59,807 --> 00:11:02,540
It does feel like Macao and Hong Kong.

284
00:11:06,273 --> 00:11:09,740
My first homework is to be a toad that returns the favor.

285
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:10,407
A toad?

286
00:11:10,407 --> 00:11:11,707
I'll be a toad that returns the favor to you.

287
00:11:11,707 --> 00:11:14,340
- I'm a toad. Toad among comedians. / - A toad.

288
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:17,540
I've been on Battle Trip for almost 100 episodes...

289
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:18,707
But I've never seen that pose before.

290
00:11:18,707 --> 00:11:20,507
Toad that returns the favor.

291
00:11:20,507 --> 00:11:21,973
Quiet and throbbing...

292
00:11:21,973 --> 00:11:25,607
Toad, Toad, Toad Tour.

293
00:11:26,007 --> 00:11:27,340
Frog.

294
00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:28,607
Toad.

295
00:11:32,807 --> 00:11:34,073
We made them laugh.

296
00:11:37,173 --> 00:11:38,040
It looks like a folk tale.

297
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:40,340
That's from "Master Cabbage and Master Radish."

298
00:11:41,773 --> 00:11:43,340
Toad. Toad.

299
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:46,607
Would you like to go on a trip with me?

300
00:11:46,607 --> 00:11:47,940
Yes. I've made up my mind.

301
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:49,740
I'll plan this trip well

302
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:51,840
and return the favor.

303
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:53,040
You can trust me.

304
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,740
Look here.

305
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:56,807
You must eat this in Hangzhou.

306
00:11:56,807 --> 00:11:59,673
When it's fun and great, I'll pay for it.

307
00:11:59,673 --> 00:12:01,840
When it's boring, I'll pay for just half.

308
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:03,073
(Open or not?)

309
00:12:03,073 --> 00:12:04,807
The purse... Pays for everything.

310
00:12:04,807 --> 00:12:06,140
Open it up.

311
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:08,807
I'm paying for mine only today.

312
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:11,107
You have a definite theme.

313
00:12:11,107 --> 00:12:13,740
The toad's effort shows off.

314
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:15,173
- Oh, that. / - That's delicious.

315
00:12:15,173 --> 00:12:16,140
You have that in Taiwan.

316
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:17,740
I heard that's really good.

317
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:20,073
Hyunhee is hooked.

318
00:12:20,073 --> 00:12:21,373
This is the most delicious.

319
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:22,840
Goodness.

320
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:28,107
(Toad Hong showed everything about Hangzhou)

321
00:12:28,107 --> 00:12:31,040
Hangzhou is really dazzling.

322
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,807
- It's completely changed. / - What is that?

323
00:12:32,807 --> 00:12:34,007
There's another toad.

324
00:12:34,007 --> 00:12:35,840
There's a crisis.

325
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:37,373
It's Sungkyu's birthday today.

326
00:12:37,373 --> 00:12:40,040
- Did she keep talking about it? / - Never stopped.

327
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:42,007
- Sungkyu's birthday. / - It's Hakyeon.

328
00:12:42,007 --> 00:12:44,373
We have a setback here.

329
00:12:44,973 --> 00:12:46,640
Please stop now.

330
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:49,807
Was Toad Hong able to return the favor

331
00:12:49,807 --> 00:12:51,473
in Hangzhou?

332
00:12:51,473 --> 00:12:53,840
The toad will be filled with venom in the end.

333
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,707
Up to here.

334
00:12:55,707 --> 00:12:56,907
I can't wait to watch.

335
00:12:56,907 --> 00:12:58,140
It sounds fun.

336
00:12:58,373 --> 00:13:01,507
(Incheon International Airport)

337
00:13:02,407 --> 00:13:05,307
(A woman waits alone)

338
00:13:06,173 --> 00:13:08,907
(She seems to be waiting for someone)

339
00:13:09,073 --> 00:13:14,407
(Hyunhee waits for Sohyun with gifts in one hand)

340
00:13:14,673 --> 00:13:16,207
She's here.

341
00:13:17,407 --> 00:13:18,473
You're here.

342
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:20,707
Sohyun...

343
00:13:21,607 --> 00:13:23,173
- Hyunhee. / - Sohyun.

344
00:13:23,173 --> 00:13:26,073
- I thought you weren't coming. / - Awesome.

345
00:13:26,073 --> 00:13:28,673
What is all this? Hakyeon.

346
00:13:28,673 --> 00:13:31,407
- VIXX and Lovelyz are back. / - Lovelyz.

347
00:13:31,407 --> 00:13:38,273
- My goodness. / - I pasted them on myself...

348
00:13:38,273 --> 00:13:39,307
This is amazing.

349
00:13:39,307 --> 00:13:41,573
You really do know Sohyun well.

350
00:13:42,073 --> 00:13:44,473
(Before the trip)

351
00:13:44,473 --> 00:13:46,907
(She sewed it strand by strand)

352
00:13:48,373 --> 00:13:50,840
This is the Hollywood, New York style.

353
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:52,307
Look here, please.

354
00:13:52,307 --> 00:13:54,373
1, 2, 3.

355
00:13:54,373 --> 00:13:55,840
- I was very happy. / - Lovelyz.

356
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:01,673
(Happy departure with idols)

357
00:14:02,073 --> 00:14:03,873
Quiet and throbbing...

358
00:14:03,873 --> 00:14:06,007
Toad Tour that returns the favor.

359
00:14:06,007 --> 00:14:08,373
- Bye. / - Follow me.

360
00:14:10,173 --> 00:14:11,707
We were excited.

361
00:14:11,707 --> 00:14:12,673
How long does it take?

362
00:14:12,673 --> 00:14:15,473
- It takes 2 hours to Hangzhou. / - Was it 69 minutes?

363
00:14:15,473 --> 00:14:19,007
It's 69 minutes. It's very close.

364
00:14:19,007 --> 00:14:20,273
What about the time difference?

365
00:14:20,273 --> 00:14:22,473
It's an hour behind Korea.

366
00:14:22,473 --> 00:14:24,407
- The time? / - Yes, the time difference.

367
00:14:24,407 --> 00:14:26,440
- This is Hangzhou, Sohyun. / - Oh, my.

368
00:14:27,807 --> 00:14:29,107
(Sneeze)

369
00:14:29,673 --> 00:14:31,473
Maybe the air isn't right for you.

370
00:14:31,473 --> 00:14:33,240
- Sohyun. / - The weather is so nice.

371
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:35,107
How do you feel to be back after 10 years?

372
00:14:35,107 --> 00:14:37,273
Now that I'm back after 10 years,

373
00:14:37,273 --> 00:14:40,173
- It's changed, right? / - I don't remember a thing.

374
00:14:40,707 --> 00:14:42,507
I remember absolutely nothing.

375
00:14:42,507 --> 00:14:44,073
I don't remember anything.

376
00:14:44,073 --> 00:14:46,407
It's my first time here. I'm very excited.

377
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:50,540
As of today, I'm your guide.

378
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:52,707
You look tired. One second.

379
00:14:52,707 --> 00:14:55,873
You don't need to do anything. Just turn around.

380
00:14:55,873 --> 00:14:58,473
I'm happy. I'm excited.

381
00:14:58,473 --> 00:15:00,673
I kept catching her attention with it.

382
00:15:00,673 --> 00:15:02,240
- Does that recharge her? / - Yes.

383
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:04,707
That really does charge Sohyun.

384
00:15:04,707 --> 00:15:07,307
West Lake that I've told you so many times.

385
00:15:07,307 --> 00:15:09,273
- It's pronounced as Xi Hu. / - Xi Hu?

386
00:15:09,273 --> 00:15:11,607
Let's go take a break there.

387
00:15:11,807 --> 00:15:14,007
(Toad Tour, day 1)

388
00:15:14,007 --> 00:15:16,473
(West Lake)

389
00:15:16,473 --> 00:15:18,840
I've heard about it before.

390
00:15:19,873 --> 00:15:21,873
(Hangzhou trip begins by taking a taxi)

391
00:15:22,473 --> 00:15:25,107
It's a World Heritage Site designated by UNESCO.

392
00:15:25,107 --> 00:15:26,207
As soon as we got here...

393
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:27,340
Going to a World Heritage Site first?

394
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:29,740
The four beauties...

395
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:31,940
It's as beautiful as Xi Shi.

396
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:34,173
That's why it's Xi Hu?

397
00:15:34,173 --> 00:15:36,940
- Is that a lake? / - Yes.

398
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:38,440
- That's huge. / - That's in the land?

399
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:40,073
Here...

400
00:15:40,707 --> 00:15:43,373
There are small islands inside West Lake.

401
00:15:43,373 --> 00:15:44,407
It's like Bamseom islet in Yeouido.

402
00:15:44,407 --> 00:15:46,007
Are we going to visit the islands?

403
00:15:46,007 --> 00:15:47,607
Every one of them.

404
00:15:47,607 --> 00:15:49,340
It was so beautiful.

405
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:51,307
The land is huge.

406
00:15:51,307 --> 00:15:52,773
- It's a different scale. / - It's nice and cool.

407
00:15:52,773 --> 00:15:55,973
Girls who love taking pictures must go.

408
00:15:55,973 --> 00:15:56,840
Seriously.

409
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:58,207
The pictures turn out so well.

410
00:15:58,207 --> 00:15:59,307
- Thank you. / - Bye-bye.

411
00:15:59,307 --> 00:16:01,140
- West Lake. / - My goodness.

412
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:02,940
They must be Korean.

413
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:05,073
Travelers from all around the world are here.

414
00:16:05,073 --> 00:16:06,707
All the tourists are here.

415
00:16:06,707 --> 00:16:09,273
Enjoy observing the crowds first.

416
00:16:09,273 --> 00:16:10,940
So many people.

417
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:12,607
We're going to take a boat in

418
00:16:12,607 --> 00:16:14,607
West Lake's first scenic spot...

419
00:16:14,607 --> 00:16:16,073
- The West Lake... / - Huh?

420
00:16:16,073 --> 00:16:19,107
- Are you listening? / - I'm listening.

421
00:16:19,107 --> 00:16:21,040
- Who am I talking to? / - I'm listening.

422
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:23,107
You're not listening to each other.

423
00:16:23,107 --> 00:16:23,973
You went on a trip together.

424
00:16:23,973 --> 00:16:25,473
We couldn't communicate very well.

425
00:16:25,473 --> 00:16:27,807
(The 2nd scenic spot in West Lake picked by Hyunhee)

426
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:33,107
(Scenic spot 1, Xiao Ying Zhou, island inside the lake)

427
00:16:33,107 --> 00:16:35,040
- That's pretty nice. / - It's really nice.

428
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,873
I couldn't believe something so beautiful

429
00:16:36,873 --> 00:16:38,640
was so near us.

430
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:40,640
(Scenic spot 2, Three Pools Mirroring the Moon)

431
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:47,873
(Gourd-bottle-shaped stone pagodas)

432
00:16:50,073 --> 00:16:50,973
What did I tell you before?

433
00:16:50,973 --> 00:16:53,273
Scenic spot 1 is Xiao Ying Zhou.

434
00:16:53,273 --> 00:16:55,273
Scenic spot 2 is Three Pools Mirroring the Moon.

435
00:16:55,273 --> 00:16:57,873
To see Three Pools Mirroring the Moon, just look here.

436
00:16:57,873 --> 00:17:00,640
- It's in the bill. / - It's in the bill?

437
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:02,407
- The 1 yuan note. / - This is where we're going.

438
00:17:02,407 --> 00:17:04,973
This is nice.

439
00:17:04,973 --> 00:17:06,973
It kind of feels like Thailand too.

440
00:17:06,973 --> 00:17:08,273
This is nice.

441
00:17:08,273 --> 00:17:10,940
(The boat ride costs $30 per hour)

442
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:13,040
- You have to go there. / - I want to ride that boat.

443
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:14,873
You must ride on the boat.

444
00:17:14,873 --> 00:17:16,140
It's such a nice experience.

445
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:17,307
It's 180 yuan per hour.

446
00:17:17,307 --> 00:17:19,007
It only costs about $30.40 for the hour.

447
00:17:19,007 --> 00:17:21,807
You can enjoy great views for that price.

448
00:17:21,807 --> 00:17:25,640
(It's indeed a recommended spot for travelers)

449
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:33,207
- You take a lot of photos too. / - Yes, I do.

450
00:17:33,207 --> 00:17:35,640
Or I won't remember the trip.

451
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:37,473
- To leave behind memories? / - Yes, yes.

452
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:39,807
She's always out of battery.

453
00:17:39,807 --> 00:17:41,440
I see it now.

454
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:44,040
- I see it. / - You can see it, right?

455
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:45,640
I can see it.

456
00:17:46,407 --> 00:17:49,340
- Gourd-shaped pagodas? / - They're on the bill.

457
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:51,407
So this is scenic spot 2.

458
00:17:51,407 --> 00:17:53,873
- 3 Pools Mirroring the Moon. / - That's so pretty.

459
00:17:53,873 --> 00:17:55,873
It looked exactly like on the bill.

460
00:17:55,873 --> 00:17:59,473
It was so interesting to visit the site on the bill.

461
00:18:06,573 --> 00:18:08,940
There are three stone pagodas.

462
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:10,173
That's right. There are three.

463
00:18:10,173 --> 00:18:13,573
A representative Chinese politician and a poet,

464
00:18:13,573 --> 00:18:16,907
Su Dongpo, built 3 gourd-bottle-shaped stone pagodas

465
00:18:16,907 --> 00:18:18,873
in the deep parts of the lake

466
00:18:18,873 --> 00:18:21,873
to mark the area where fish farming was prohibited.

467
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:24,640
I can see the pavilions in this quiet

468
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:27,440
and peaceful part of the lake.

469
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:31,340
(To enter Xiao Ying Zhou, it costs $3.40)

470
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:33,773
VIXX would've liked it too.

471
00:18:33,773 --> 00:18:35,540
You're right.

472
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:38,473
- We're traveling together. / - Be rejuvenated.

473
00:18:40,273 --> 00:18:41,440
I took care of them.

474
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:45,573
It was built during the Tang Dynasty 400 years ago.

475
00:18:45,573 --> 00:18:47,940
- 400 years ago? / - Yes.

476
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:51,873
Xiao Ying Zhou is the biggest island.

477
00:18:51,873 --> 00:18:53,740
- It is? / - In the West Lake.

478
00:18:54,807 --> 00:18:56,173
This island is the best place among

479
00:18:56,173 --> 00:18:58,440
top 10 places in West Lake.

480
00:19:00,273 --> 00:19:02,607
Oh, my. How nice.

481
00:19:04,307 --> 00:19:05,973
I hear birds.

482
00:19:06,407 --> 00:19:08,440
Do you not remember anything from 10 years ago?

483
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:10,273
I don't remember anything.

484
00:19:10,273 --> 00:19:11,940
I'm shocked by that.

485
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:14,140
I didn't go on the boat the last time I was there.

486
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:17,073
- Right. / - This must be it.

487
00:19:17,073 --> 00:19:18,440
If you look from above..

488
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:20,440
- We passed this point earlier. / - Right.

489
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:22,207
This is what it looks like from above.

490
00:19:23,873 --> 00:19:25,940
It's a 400-year-old artificial island.

491
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:27,407
- It's been there for 400 years? / - Yes.

492
00:19:27,407 --> 00:19:28,773
They're on a different scale.

493
00:19:28,773 --> 00:19:30,840
This is amazing. Seriously.

494
00:19:31,473 --> 00:19:33,007
What a view.

495
00:19:33,407 --> 00:19:34,607
- Seriously. / - Amazing.

496
00:19:34,607 --> 00:19:36,407
I see why this is one of the best sights.

497
00:19:36,407 --> 00:19:38,507
They dug out the ground to make a artificial island.

498
00:19:39,907 --> 00:19:42,307
- It's so pretty. / - The scenery with the water, land...

499
00:19:42,307 --> 00:19:44,540
And nature is beautiful.

500
00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:46,140
You have to go there to

501
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:47,107
understand the 400-year history.

502
00:19:47,107 --> 00:19:50,240
I can't help but take photos.

503
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:54,807
(She loses herself in taking selfies)

504
00:19:54,807 --> 00:19:57,240
- You two don't get along. / - I was exhausted.

505
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:57,840
No chemistry.

506
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:00,740
They're not even walking together.

507
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:03,240
Can you stop making the camera shutter noises?

508
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:04,873
I should keep turning the camera.

509
00:20:05,273 --> 00:20:08,773
My gosh, that's enough.

510
00:20:08,773 --> 00:20:10,873
The toad's venom filling up.

511
00:20:10,873 --> 00:20:12,840
I wanted to listen to the sounds of nature.

512
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:15,573
I know that she's beautiful.

513
00:20:15,573 --> 00:20:17,707
- She checks herself all the time. / - She's annoyed.

514
00:20:17,707 --> 00:20:20,407
- She is angry. / - I thought she'd take nature photos.

515
00:20:20,407 --> 00:20:22,940
She used the nature as her backdrop.

516
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:26,140
She took endless selfies.

517
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:29,807
I thought she did it because she was pretty.

518
00:20:29,807 --> 00:20:31,840
But now, all I can remember is the clicking noise

519
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:33,273
when I think of the West Lake.

520
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:37,240
Do you take selfies when you're with a guy?

521
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:38,840
I don't remember.

522
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:40,473
But now, all I can remember is the clicking noise...

523
00:20:40,473 --> 00:20:43,073
- When I think of the West Lake. / - Only photos last.

524
00:20:44,407 --> 00:20:47,340
That's all I could hear.

525
00:20:47,807 --> 00:20:49,207
- How is it? Isn't it beautiful? / - So beautiful.

526
00:20:49,207 --> 00:20:51,040
We've said that about 100 times.

527
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:53,807
Sohyun, you kept saying that it was beautiful.

528
00:20:53,807 --> 00:20:56,807
Earlier, we were at the entrance

529
00:20:56,807 --> 00:21:00,073
and on the boat. You have to pay for those.

530
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:01,540
Since you said it was beautiful

531
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:03,473
so it's time for you to pay.

532
00:21:03,473 --> 00:21:05,207
- She should pay. / - That's right.

533
00:21:05,207 --> 00:21:07,273
- It was the first time to pay. / - Great plan.

534
00:21:07,273 --> 00:21:08,773
I prepared this for you.

535
00:21:08,773 --> 00:21:11,807
This looks like you.

536
00:21:13,673 --> 00:21:15,973
Will I pay or not?

537
00:21:15,973 --> 00:21:18,073
Since this is my first stop,

538
00:21:18,073 --> 00:21:19,707
you must be objective.

539
00:21:20,707 --> 00:21:22,673
(Will the purse open up wide or not?)

540
00:21:23,273 --> 00:21:24,140
You have to visit that lake.

541
00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:26,673
Sohyun is known to be objective.

542
00:21:26,673 --> 00:21:29,073
That was the main stop.

543
00:21:29,073 --> 00:21:31,507
If I really like it, I'll pay for everything.

544
00:21:33,407 --> 00:21:34,907
Everything.

545
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:38,540
- Everything. / - It opened.

546
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:41,673
- The purse has opened. / - It opened up.

547
00:21:43,107 --> 00:21:44,307
You have to for this place.

548
00:21:44,307 --> 00:21:45,873
They're not eating much.

549
00:21:45,873 --> 00:21:48,340
I'm getting a bit tired now.

550
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:51,573
Too much scenery and not enough food.

551
00:21:51,573 --> 00:21:53,573
(Toad Tour, day 1)

552
00:21:53,573 --> 00:21:56,507
(Qing Dynasty Street)

553
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:00,407
- Hangzhou... / - It's only 7 minutes away?

554
00:22:00,407 --> 00:22:03,307
It's nearby but it's so different.

555
00:22:03,307 --> 00:22:05,840
The West Lake was so amazing.

556
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:08,507
If that was nature...

557
00:22:08,507 --> 00:22:10,807
Now we're at the Insa-dong of Hangzhou.

558
00:22:13,573 --> 00:22:14,507
You're right.

559
00:22:14,507 --> 00:22:16,040
- So cool. / - Qing Dynasty...

560
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:17,407
They're located next to those tall buildings.

561
00:22:17,407 --> 00:22:18,607
Fascinating.

562
00:22:18,607 --> 00:22:21,507
It's just like Jeonju Hanok Village.

563
00:22:22,473 --> 00:22:24,140
What's that?

564
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:25,273
(He Fang Jie)

565
00:22:25,273 --> 00:22:27,240
(Buildings from 1,000 years ago still remain)

566
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:30,440
(You can experience historical sights of Hangzhou)

567
00:22:33,307 --> 00:22:35,440
This is what's really fun.

568
00:22:36,573 --> 00:22:39,140
- Wow, what is that? / - I've tried that.

569
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:41,473
- That's famous. / - Is that spicy rice cakes?

570
00:22:41,473 --> 00:22:42,907
I can eat 100 of those just standing there.

571
00:22:42,907 --> 00:22:44,640
Minkyoung, aren't you feeling better all of a sudden?

572
00:22:45,107 --> 00:22:46,473
It's interesting now, right?

573
00:22:46,473 --> 00:22:48,640
It's so much fun.

574
00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:52,640
I wanted to meet that guy

575
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:54,107
when I was researching for this trip.

576
00:22:54,107 --> 00:22:55,640
Why is she touching the statue?

577
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:58,173
That's Laughing Buddha Statue, Sohyun.

578
00:22:58,173 --> 00:23:00,707
The monk kept his belongings in a gunny sack...

579
00:23:00,707 --> 00:23:02,640
- And carried it around. / - He looks cute.

580
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:05,073
When you touch his belly, you get good fortune.

581
00:23:05,073 --> 00:23:07,473
People told me that I look like him a lot.

582
00:23:07,473 --> 00:23:08,840
You do resemble him.

583
00:23:09,340 --> 00:23:12,673
But it seems like he and I look alike.

584
00:23:12,673 --> 00:23:14,007
Hyunhee, you do look like him a bit.

585
00:23:14,007 --> 00:23:16,340
- Right. We should touch it too. / - Look at him.

586
00:23:16,907 --> 00:23:20,173
(Similar)

587
00:23:20,173 --> 00:23:22,607
(The more we look, the more she resembles him)

588
00:23:22,607 --> 00:23:23,373
I got it.

589
00:23:24,473 --> 00:23:26,473
- We're all the same. / - You look similar.

590
00:23:26,473 --> 00:23:28,807
Our stomachs are really similar.

591
00:23:28,807 --> 00:23:29,740
They draw portraits

592
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:30,707
just like the artist in Korea.

593
00:23:30,707 --> 00:23:32,007
We have artists in Insa-dong too.

594
00:23:32,007 --> 00:23:33,607
That's why it feels familiar.

595
00:23:33,607 --> 00:23:35,573
Should we get one too?

596
00:23:35,573 --> 00:23:36,907
Should we buy one that looks like us?

597
00:23:36,907 --> 00:23:39,073
Wait, that's not it. Isn't this paper craft?

598
00:23:39,073 --> 00:23:42,040
It's made of paper. Isn't this cut? Look at this.

599
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:43,573
It's not a drawing? No way.

600
00:23:43,573 --> 00:23:46,140
- She cut this just like this. / - You're right. She's cutting it.

601
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:47,307
She didn't draw these.

602
00:23:47,307 --> 00:23:49,240
- That's paper? / - Yes, that's paper.

603
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:51,940
- She didn't draw it? / - That's a paper craft portrait.

604
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:53,307
This is so interesting.

605
00:23:53,307 --> 00:23:57,040
(All of the artworks are made of cutout paper)

606
00:23:57,473 --> 00:23:59,307
Do you want to get one of this?

607
00:23:59,307 --> 00:24:01,207
- Hello. / - Hello.

608
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:04,373
We resemble each other.

609
00:24:04,373 --> 00:24:05,240
Ask her to do your portrait.

610
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:08,807
We should each get one and check if we do look alike.

611
00:24:08,807 --> 00:24:10,107
They don't get along.

612
00:24:11,207 --> 00:24:13,840
- Face cutter. / - Face.

613
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:16,073
- My goodness. / - Without even an outline?

614
00:24:16,073 --> 00:24:17,073
My goodness.

615
00:24:17,073 --> 00:24:19,440
She cuts the paper right away.

616
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:20,807
- No way. / - I mean it.

617
00:24:20,807 --> 00:24:22,273
- She just folds it and does it? / - I was shocked.

618
00:24:22,273 --> 00:24:24,540
This is interesting.

619
00:24:24,540 --> 00:24:25,973
- She's looking at you and cutting? / - That's right.

620
00:24:25,973 --> 00:24:27,373
It didn't take that long.

621
00:24:27,373 --> 00:24:29,607
Her scissors aren't that small either.

622
00:24:30,673 --> 00:24:32,373
- Her scissors are quite big. / - Exactly.

623
00:24:32,373 --> 00:24:33,273
(Snip, snip)

624
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:37,473
I could report this on "How Is That Possible."

625
00:24:37,473 --> 00:24:40,107
She got a lot of ideas from this trip.

626
00:24:40,107 --> 00:24:41,673
I mean, seriously.

627
00:24:41,673 --> 00:24:43,840
How could she do that without a rough sketch?

628
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:46,140
How is that possible?

629
00:24:47,507 --> 00:24:48,840
She did it with her scissors.

630
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:50,273
How does she do that?

631
00:24:50,273 --> 00:24:52,973
It's her first time seeing us, right?

632
00:24:52,973 --> 00:24:55,507
That's Sohyun's face.

633
00:24:55,507 --> 00:24:57,107
Seriously...

634
00:24:57,107 --> 00:24:58,240
Me?

635
00:24:59,607 --> 00:25:02,240
(Feeling nervous)

636
00:25:03,507 --> 00:25:05,307
I just want her to make mine looks just like yours.

637
00:25:05,307 --> 00:25:07,507
She's so talented. How does she do that?

638
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:11,473
(Will their paper portraits resemble each other?)

639
00:25:11,473 --> 00:25:14,540
She carved the paper a bit more.

640
00:25:15,173 --> 00:25:17,540
She's making the chin bigger.

641
00:25:18,340 --> 00:25:20,240
It'd be a memorable souvenir.

642
00:25:21,307 --> 00:25:22,673
Before she shows...

643
00:25:22,673 --> 00:25:24,207
- My gosh! / - My gosh!

644
00:25:24,273 --> 00:25:25,007
Before she shows...

645
00:25:25,007 --> 00:25:26,673
- My gosh! / - My gosh!

646
00:25:27,073 --> 00:25:28,773
- My goodness. / - It's so pretty.

647
00:25:28,773 --> 00:25:30,273
That's not me.

648
00:25:30,273 --> 00:25:32,607
- That's too pretty. / - That's too pretty.

649
00:25:32,607 --> 00:25:34,173
She has to make a living.

650
00:25:34,173 --> 00:25:36,007
She needs a bigger face.

651
00:25:36,007 --> 00:25:37,473
She's a businesswoman.

652
00:25:37,473 --> 00:25:40,607
This is so cute. This looks like a cartoon character.

653
00:25:41,607 --> 00:25:42,873
It doesn't look like me.

654
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:46,840
This is how she sees me.

655
00:25:48,407 --> 00:25:50,773
(A paper portrait with the exact same bangs and outfit)

656
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:53,240
Our noses and mouths look similar.

657
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:56,073
- And the eyes too. / - But it feels different.

658
00:25:56,073 --> 00:25:58,040
- I got it. I found what it is. / - Our vibes are different.

659
00:25:58,040 --> 00:26:02,140
Your face is slender, and mine is round.

660
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:05,940
Hey, don't say that we look alike. We don't look alike.

661
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:08,507
I'll treasure this for the rest of my life.

662
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:12,240
Hey, let's go and get that. I really like that.

663
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:14,473
- That's so pretty. / - You must eat something to win.

664
00:26:14,473 --> 00:26:17,373
The food we must try here is the fried blue crabs.

665
00:26:17,373 --> 00:26:18,973
I heard this is very famous here.

666
00:26:18,973 --> 00:26:21,207
Fried blue crabs.

667
00:26:21,207 --> 00:26:22,973
- The blue crabs were huge. / - It'll be good.

668
00:26:22,973 --> 00:26:27,673
It's like the old cart bars.

669
00:26:29,473 --> 00:26:30,973
This is written in Korean.

670
00:26:30,973 --> 00:26:33,307
Qing He Fang Street.

671
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:36,840
It's written in Korean.

672
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:38,907
That's it. Everyone must go there.

673
00:26:38,907 --> 00:26:39,907
- This is the place. / - This is a nice place.

674
00:26:39,907 --> 00:26:43,073
- I really wanted to try it. / - I like this place.

675
00:26:43,073 --> 00:26:47,107
(They serve authentic Hangzhou dishes)

676
00:26:47,107 --> 00:26:48,873
- That must be Dongpo pork. / - You can find every dish in here.

677
00:26:48,873 --> 00:26:51,773
- They have everything. / - Lots of interesting dishes.

678
00:26:54,273 --> 00:26:55,407
Let's check out what's here.

679
00:26:55,407 --> 00:26:57,740
So much variety.

680
00:26:57,740 --> 00:27:00,607
It's tofu. Isn't that stinky tofu?

681
00:27:00,607 --> 00:27:03,607
- I've never tried stinky tofu. / - Me neither.

682
00:27:03,607 --> 00:27:06,373
It smells really unique.

683
00:27:06,373 --> 00:27:08,207
- Stinky tofu... / - It's a strong smell.

684
00:27:08,207 --> 00:27:10,173
- It's not for the feint-hearted. / - Want to try one?

685
00:27:10,173 --> 00:27:11,673
Let's try just one.

686
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:13,540
Let's try just one.

687
00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:15,373
(Challenge accepted)

688
00:27:15,707 --> 00:27:17,840
You're eating that for your first meal?

689
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:19,340
- We just gave it a try. / - How was it?

690
00:27:19,340 --> 00:27:21,773
I wanted to describe it to the viewers.

691
00:27:24,473 --> 00:27:25,940
Thank you.

692
00:27:27,007 --> 00:27:28,840
- Stinky tofu. / - What a great price at $1.70.

693
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:31,573
I only saw the food descriptions on TV.

694
00:27:31,573 --> 00:27:34,540
I heard it's slightly rotten.

695
00:27:34,540 --> 00:27:35,840
Isn't that what stinky tofu is?

696
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:41,073
- Here it comes. / - Here goes.

697
00:27:41,073 --> 00:27:42,707
She's still eating well.

698
00:27:42,707 --> 00:27:44,440
I really enjoyed it.

699
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:46,973
Even a small bite smells so much.

700
00:27:48,573 --> 00:27:50,640
It smells even more.

701
00:27:51,573 --> 00:27:52,873
- It's starting now. / - It's hit her.

702
00:27:52,873 --> 00:27:54,107
Here it comes.

703
00:27:57,873 --> 00:27:59,673
- She's looking for a place to lean on. / - It's hit me.

704
00:27:59,673 --> 00:28:01,173
It's a sudden hit.

705
00:28:08,173 --> 00:28:11,140
How do I describe it?

706
00:28:11,140 --> 00:28:13,240
I can't swallow it.

707
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:15,373
The more I chew, the more it smells.

708
00:28:16,873 --> 00:28:19,007
(Watch me, I'm going to swallow it)

709
00:28:19,007 --> 00:28:21,440
- She swallowed. / - She ate it all.

710
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:24,940
- It makes you sweat. / - I'm sweating.

711
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:26,907
When I first chewed it, it tasted like braised tofu.

712
00:28:26,907 --> 00:28:29,007
The good ones my mom made for me.

713
00:28:29,007 --> 00:28:29,573
It was good at first.

714
00:28:29,573 --> 00:28:31,840
Of course, because it's deep fried.

715
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:33,740
It tasted like eating tofu in a toilet as I chewed more.

716
00:28:33,740 --> 00:28:35,440
- I become uglier as I eat. / - That's what it's like.

717
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:38,873
But if you keep chewing, you get used to it.

718
00:28:40,407 --> 00:28:43,607
- Now it really feels like I'm in China. / - Yeah.

719
00:28:43,607 --> 00:28:46,473
- Finally. / - I really wanted to try this.

720
00:28:46,473 --> 00:28:47,540
Now it feels like China.

721
00:28:47,540 --> 00:28:49,807
- Blue crabs. / - These are the blue crabs.

722
00:28:49,807 --> 00:28:50,940
This is a blue crab.

723
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:53,473
- Isn't this blue crab? / - Shrimp and crab.

724
00:28:53,473 --> 00:28:55,373
- It's deep fried blue crab. / - That looks good.

725
00:28:55,373 --> 00:28:57,573
That's soft crab.

726
00:28:57,573 --> 00:28:58,240
You eat the shell as well.

727
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:00,507
- You eat it whole. / - They have thin shells.

728
00:29:00,507 --> 00:29:02,607
They're thin. So you don't have to pull out the meat

729
00:29:02,607 --> 00:29:04,240
so it's really easy to eat.

730
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:05,673
They're huge.

731
00:29:07,773 --> 00:29:09,907
- It's squid. / - Let's get it.

732
00:29:10,573 --> 00:29:12,040
- Squid. / - Spicy rice cakes.

733
00:29:14,007 --> 00:29:15,873
Let's relax and eat.

734
00:29:17,473 --> 00:29:18,673
Squid spicy rice cakes?

735
00:29:18,673 --> 00:29:20,973
- They have spicy rice cakes? / - Yes, with squid.

736
00:29:20,973 --> 00:29:23,840
We tried it to see how different it is from Korean food.

737
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:26,273
It costs $1.70.

738
00:29:26,273 --> 00:29:30,607
It's soy sauce based and slightly spicy.

739
00:29:30,607 --> 00:29:32,107
It's completely different from Korean spicy rice cakes.

740
00:29:32,107 --> 00:29:34,873
- It's like royal rice cakes. / - That's right.

741
00:29:34,873 --> 00:29:37,173
It's not spicy like the Korean ones

742
00:29:37,173 --> 00:29:39,107
so you can just keep eating it.

743
00:29:39,107 --> 00:29:41,473
- Deep fried blue crab was so good. / - What is that?

744
00:29:41,473 --> 00:29:43,107
- Blue crab. / - Fried blue crab.

745
00:29:44,073 --> 00:29:45,340
They're so big.

746
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:48,273
You can eat the legs as well.

747
00:29:48,273 --> 00:29:49,507
Right? It's tender.

748
00:29:49,507 --> 00:29:51,207
- The shell is tender. / - It's tender.

749
00:29:51,807 --> 00:29:53,373
Can you eat it without beer?

750
00:29:53,373 --> 00:29:55,340
I craved for a beer so much.

751
00:29:55,340 --> 00:29:59,107
I sometimes have the crab snack with beer at home.

752
00:29:59,673 --> 00:30:00,440
It's the luxurious version.

753
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:02,907
It's less salty than that snack.

754
00:30:02,907 --> 00:30:05,107
It's less salty, yet it has more meat.

755
00:30:05,107 --> 00:30:07,340
It made me forget the painful memory of stinky tofu.

756
00:30:09,373 --> 00:30:10,340
The venom is rising.

757
00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:13,907
She has to spray her venom once a day.

758
00:30:14,173 --> 00:30:16,040
(A taste she could never forget)

759
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:18,173
(But Toad Hong forgot about the stinky tofu)

760
00:30:18,173 --> 00:30:20,473
Deep crab was so good that I was so excited.

761
00:30:20,473 --> 00:30:21,773
It's good.

762
00:30:25,373 --> 00:30:27,540
My no. 1 food is deep fried blue crab.

763
00:30:27,540 --> 00:30:28,307
Eating ends so fast.

764
00:30:28,307 --> 00:30:30,707
- I want to go there. / - Let's go to Qing Dynasty street.

765
00:30:30,707 --> 00:30:31,740
The night view.

766
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:33,807
You will be overwhelmed.

767

769
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:43,373
(It's dark in West Lake)

770
00:30:43,373 --> 00:30:44,640
I want to go there.

771
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:47,040
The night was so different from the day.

772
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:52,340
We must buy the ticket to see West Lake.

773
00:30:52,340 --> 00:30:55,340
This is what I wanted to see the most.

774
00:30:57,340 --> 00:30:58,673
No way!

775
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:01,740
No way!

776
00:31:02,107 --> 00:31:03,873
This is 4D.

777
00:31:04,707 --> 00:31:06,340
5D!

778
00:31:06,340 --> 00:31:07,707
They have performances like that.

779
00:31:07,707 --> 00:31:10,340
- You went there, Hwijae. / - That was amazing.

780

(Enduring Memories of Hangzhou)

781
00:31:13,273 --> 00:31:14,840
It was on a grand scale.

782
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:16,773
That's China for you.

783
00:31:22,573 --> 00:31:25,607
There were also so many performers.

784
00:31:25,607 --> 00:31:30,073
- Just that was overwhelming. / - It was.

785
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:35,207
(The auditorium is filled without space)

786
00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:40,540
It feels like a baseball stadium.

787
00:31:40,540 --> 00:31:42,340
- Right. / - It's exciting and...

788
00:31:42,740 --> 00:31:44,473
- Right. / - It's exciting and...

789
00:31:48,673 --> 00:31:51,140
She's on top of the lake.

790
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:55,673
Goodness. Is she on the top of the water?

791
00:31:55,673 --> 00:31:58,540
No other stage can be as big as this.

792
00:31:58,540 --> 00:31:59,873
The stage...

793
00:31:59,873 --> 00:32:00,840
The stage stretches all the way out.

794
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:04,440
They can use it because this is an artificial lake.

795
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:08,373
- It's beautiful. / - It's beautiful.

796
00:32:10,707 --> 00:32:14,007
There are many performers because the stage is big.

797
00:32:15,307 --> 00:32:16,307
It's so nice.

798
00:32:16,307 --> 00:32:18,807
The background is real trees and mountains.

799
00:32:18,807 --> 00:32:19,740
All nature.

800
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:21,440
It's over 400 people if you include everyone in the back,

801
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:22,607
but it looks like it's over 800

802
00:32:22,607 --> 00:32:24,473
because of the reflection on the water.

803
00:32:24,473 --> 00:32:27,007
- That moon reflects on the water. / - I know.

804
00:32:27,007 --> 00:32:29,907
It looks like there are more people.

805
00:32:30,607 --> 00:32:32,907
(The reflection on the lake creates a magnificent view)

806
00:32:35,907 --> 00:32:37,773
I'll pay for the whole thing, Hyunhee.

807
00:32:37,773 --> 00:32:40,240
- With this. / - Pay for the whole cost.

808
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:41,473
As soon as she watched...

809
00:32:41,473 --> 00:32:43,773
I can go home now.

810
00:32:43,773 --> 00:32:46,273

00:32:54,940 --> 00:32:57,540
- Yes. The music... / - What's this song?

813
00:32:57,540 --> 00:32:59,207
"Swan Lake."

814
00:32:59,207 --> 00:33:01,440
They're performing on a real lake.

815
00:33:02,373 --> 00:33:03,907
On a real lake.

816
00:33:05,007 --> 00:33:07,173
It's ballet.

817
00:33:09,207 --> 00:33:12,207
- What? / - What?

818
00:33:17,307 --> 00:33:18,740
Goodness.

819
00:33:19,107 --> 00:33:25,040
("Swan Lake" performed on a real lake)

820
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:33,607
(Sohyun can't take her eyes off the show)

821
00:33:33,607 --> 00:33:37,407
- Doesn't it bring up old memories? / - It does.

822
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:43,507
When I was a teenager, and in my 20s.

823
00:33:44,107 --> 00:33:46,007
- Since you were a teen? / - Yes.

824
00:33:48,073 --> 00:33:50,740
Performing "Swan Lake" on a real lake.

825
00:33:50,740 --> 00:33:52,773
This is such a famous piece.

826
00:33:52,773 --> 00:33:54,640
You know this one, right?

827
00:33:54,940 --> 00:34:02,240
(Because it's something she practiced so many times)

828
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:06,707
(Sohyun has mixed feelings)

829
00:34:07,507 --> 00:34:08,940
Are you crying?

830
00:34:10,373 --> 00:34:11,507
- It's... / - I know.

831
00:34:11,507 --> 00:34:14,140
- She never cries. / - She never cries.

832
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:19,873
As soon as the music started, I felt emotional.

833
00:34:19,873 --> 00:34:24,240
It reminded me of the time 30 years ago.

834
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:25,607
I felt so emotional,

835
00:34:25,607 --> 00:34:28,907
but I didn't want to cry there.

836
00:34:28,907 --> 00:34:30,573
I decided to enjoy it.

837
00:34:30,573 --> 00:34:31,873
It has been a long time.

838
00:34:31,873 --> 00:34:34,440
I tried to think about something else.

839
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:37,107
There were happy times.

840
00:34:43,107 --> 00:34:44,640
It's terrific.

841
00:34:45,207 --> 00:34:48,107
I should be up there.

842
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:51,740
- You must miss it, don't you? / - Yeah.

843
00:34:51,740 --> 00:34:53,540
I want to do it.

844
00:34:57,207 --> 00:34:59,773
Is it your first time watching a ballet show in 20 years?

845
00:34:59,773 --> 00:35:02,540
Yes, I never went to a concert hall to watch it.

846
00:35:02,540 --> 00:35:04,640
It was too painful to watch.

847
00:35:05,773 --> 00:35:08,540
- You still feel emotional. / - Yes.

848
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:15,373
(The performance that made Sohyun cry is over)

849
00:35:15,373 --> 00:35:17,140
What did you think?

850
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:22,207
My teen life was all about ballet.

851
00:35:22,207 --> 00:35:26,173
I'm willing to open this up.

852
00:35:26,173 --> 00:35:27,340
With all my heart.

853
00:35:27,340 --> 00:35:30,440
This is your tear, longing,

854
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:31,640
and emotions.

855
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:34,907
It made me emotional too.

856
00:35:34,907 --> 00:35:36,140
I suddenly want to see the show

857
00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:38,040
after seeing Sohyun cry.

858
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:41,407
Right. Let's eat something delicious.

859
00:35:42,973 --> 00:35:44,240
I'm hungry.

860
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:49,040
I'm as hungry as the size of China.

861
00:35:49,607 --> 00:35:51,840
I'm going to eat the food at the size of China.

862
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:53,607
- That's beautiful. / - Isn't this special?

863
00:35:53,607 --> 00:35:55,607
It's a traditional Chinese restaurant.

864
00:35:55,607 --> 00:35:58,107
Look at the number written on there.

865
00:35:58,107 --> 00:36:00,540
- Do you see 1921? / - Yes.

866
00:36:00,540 --> 00:36:02,173
This is more than 100 years old.

867
00:36:02,173 --> 00:36:02,973
You can't even eat at the peak hour

868
00:36:02,973 --> 00:36:05,173
because the line is so long.

869
00:36:05,173 --> 00:36:05,740
Really?

870
00:36:05,740 --> 00:36:09,240
I told them to empty the place.

871
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:10,573
- We should hurry up. / - What should we eat?

872
00:36:10,573 --> 00:36:12,773
We're going to try traditional food.

873
00:36:13,773 --> 00:36:15,807
I've been telling you about Beggar's Chicken.

874
00:36:15,807 --> 00:36:17,407
- Right. / - "Let's eat Beggar's Chicken."

875
00:36:17,407 --> 00:36:20,707
Why is it Beggar's Chicken? It's a weird name.

876
00:36:21,007 --> 00:36:21,973
I'm curious.

877
00:36:23,573 --> 00:36:25,973
The emperor of the Qing Dynasty saw a beggar

878
00:36:25,973 --> 00:36:29,073
enjoying chicken, and told him to give him some.

879
00:36:29,073 --> 00:36:30,273
When he tried it, it was so good.

880
00:36:30,273 --> 00:36:31,807
It was good because after you wrap

881
00:36:31,807 --> 00:36:33,840
the chicken in lotus leaves...

882
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:35,507
- Apply mud. / - That's the one.

883
00:36:35,507 --> 00:36:36,907
Roast and eat.

884
00:36:36,907 --> 00:36:38,473
It removes the odor

885
00:36:38,473 --> 00:36:40,407
and when you open the leaves,

886
00:36:40,407 --> 00:36:41,640
you will smell the lotus.

887
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:43,040
You will eat the skin

888
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:44,740
and I'll eat the meat.

889
00:36:45,740 --> 00:36:47,773
(Before that)

890
00:36:47,773 --> 00:36:49,973
You need a beer.

891
00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:53,340
(Local beer that will quench the thirst from Toad Tour)

892
00:36:53,940 --> 00:36:57,540
(Local Hangzhou beer, $1.70)

893
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:01,373
- The glass is so small. / - It's so cute just like me.

894
00:37:03,507 --> 00:37:06,440
I wish glasses in Korea would be small like this.

895
00:37:08,073 --> 00:37:10,440
The alcohol content is a 2% difference, but it's mild.

896
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:12,007
When I drink beer with low alcohol content,

897
00:37:12,007 --> 00:37:12,840
I'll know right away.

898
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:15,940
It's really smooth, but it's still carbonated.

899
00:37:15,940 --> 00:37:17,673
Despite that, it's really smooth.

900
00:37:17,673 --> 00:37:19,373
- It's only 2.5%? / - Yes.

901
00:37:19,373 --> 00:37:21,373
The moment I saw it, I didn't like it.

902
00:37:21,373 --> 00:37:23,473
Even the color looks light.

903
00:37:23,473 --> 00:37:24,873
It's great if you're lightweight.

904
00:37:24,873 --> 00:37:27,073
You look like a heavy drinker.

905
00:37:27,073 --> 00:37:29,040
- She's chugging it down. / - It's really smooth.

906
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:30,273
This is so cute.

907
00:37:30,273 --> 00:37:32,973
(At that time, a mysterious dish is served)

908
00:37:33,407 --> 00:37:36,940
(What is that?)

909
00:37:37,973 --> 00:37:39,207
(Full of anticipation)

910
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:42,473
It's very... What's that?

911
00:37:44,907 --> 00:37:47,773
- It's fancy. / - It's so fancy despite the name.

912
00:37:47,773 --> 00:37:50,007
- He's asking you to smash it. / - Right?

913
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:52,340
- Smash it. / - Break it?

914
00:37:55,507 --> 00:37:57,240
(It didn't even leave a dent)

915
00:37:59,707 --> 00:38:01,273
That's hard.

916
00:38:01,273 --> 00:38:02,907
It must be harder than a walnut.

917
00:38:03,107 --> 00:38:04,873
(Harder)

918
00:38:05,340 --> 00:38:06,973
(Not even a dent)

919
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:08,840
That's really hard.

920
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:11,107
- You really couldn't break it? / - It breaks in one go.

921
00:38:11,107 --> 00:38:13,507
- He was playing with you. / - That's not the dish.

922
00:38:13,507 --> 00:38:16,240
When you hammer that, you're wishing for good luck.

923
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:18,240
- They love wishing for good luck. / - Yes.

924
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:20,207
You don't have to hit it hard.

925
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:25,173
Shamanism.

926
00:38:25,173 --> 00:38:27,173
We thought that the Beggar's Chicken was inside.

927
00:38:27,173 --> 00:38:28,340
Me too.

928
00:38:28,340 --> 00:38:31,207
- The chicken is inside there. / - It is?

929
00:38:31,207 --> 00:38:32,107
It's inside.

930
00:38:32,740 --> 00:38:34,140
- It's got mud on it. / - It's a plate.

931
00:38:34,140 --> 00:38:36,607
- Let's see what comes out. / - It's the best.

932
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:38,373
It looks delicious.

933
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:41,607
The visuals...

934
00:38:43,307 --> 00:38:44,740
The visuals...

935
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:46,840
That's just so...

936
00:38:47,807 --> 00:38:49,540
It's like smoked chicken.

937
00:38:51,373 --> 00:38:53,973
I can smell the lotus leaves.

938
00:38:55,140 --> 00:38:55,873
Just this restaurant...

939
00:38:55,873 --> 00:38:56,707
They normally cook it like that.

940
00:38:56,707 --> 00:38:57,707
That's the usual way.

941
00:38:57,707 --> 00:38:59,907
You'll see more of it cooked like that.

942
00:38:59,907 --> 00:39:01,440
Even on the streets.

943
00:39:03,073 --> 00:39:07,240
(They cook it without the mud in this restaurant)

944
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:10,773
(They infuse the lotus flavor in their own unique way)

945
00:39:10,773 --> 00:39:12,640
The Beggar's Chicken was served first

946
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:16,140
- That looks so good. / - It was so moist. I'm serious.

947
00:39:16,140 --> 00:39:20,140
It's way more tender than the rotisserie chicken.

948
00:39:20,140 --> 00:39:21,673
It's way more tender than the rotisserie chicken.

949
00:39:22,607 --> 00:39:24,740
It melted as soon as it was in my mouth.

950
00:39:24,740 --> 00:39:27,173
- It's very moist. / - It's juicy.

951
00:39:27,173 --> 00:39:29,973
- Leaves removed the chicken odor. / - That's right.

952
00:39:29,973 --> 00:39:31,707
Lotus leaves remove the chicken odor,

953
00:39:31,707 --> 00:39:33,040
and mud seals the juice.

954
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:34,873
It holds the juice from seeping out.

955
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:39,640
(She's eating the lean meat with gusto)

956
00:39:42,473 --> 00:39:43,940
You ate a lot.

957
00:39:44,173 --> 00:39:45,173
How come she's eating so much?

958
00:39:45,173 --> 00:39:47,707
- I was nervous. / - I really ate a lot.

959
00:39:48,873 --> 00:39:50,740
Is this the Dongpo pork you mentioned?

960
00:39:50,740 --> 00:39:52,540
Was it always small like this?

961
00:39:52,540 --> 00:39:54,873
How do we eat this?

962
00:39:54,873 --> 00:39:56,573
I thought she served us pudding.

963
00:39:57,040 --> 00:40:00,373
(It's different from usual Dongpo pork with bokchoy)

964
00:40:01,473 --> 00:40:04,607
(For the original dish, a whole chunk of meat is served)

965
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:08,740
- You must focus on this part. / - What a great price.

966
00:40:09,873 --> 00:40:11,173
It's so thick.

967
00:40:11,173 --> 00:40:13,373
It's just like a cake.

968
00:40:14,273 --> 00:40:16,540
The color looks like tiramisu.

969
00:40:16,540 --> 00:40:17,340
It's only $2.70.

970
00:40:17,340 --> 00:40:20,307
- You could eat more than 10. / - That's $2.70?

971
00:40:20,307 --> 00:40:22,307
- Per slice. / - Per slice?

972
00:40:22,307 --> 00:40:23,840
- It's like fish. / - Why are you sharing?

973
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:25,907
I'll be a single bite for you, Minkyoung.

974
00:40:25,907 --> 00:40:27,140
- Seriously. / - Goodness.

975
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:29,773
Should I try the skin by itself?

976
00:40:31,540 --> 00:40:33,573
This is so...

977
00:40:34,107 --> 00:40:36,440
- It's so soft like sponge cake. / - It's so good.

978
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:39,573
- It's like the braised short rib. / - It's rather sweet.

979
00:40:39,573 --> 00:40:42,373
- It's also tender too. / - It's melting in my mouth.

980
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:45,973
I'll mix the sauce with rice.

981
00:40:45,973 --> 00:40:47,440
- There you go. / - Yes, do that.

982
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:49,240
- Good job, Hyunhee. / - That's right up my alley.

983
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:52,140
I mixed rice with the sauce.

984
00:40:54,873 --> 00:40:57,007
I'm having Dongpo pork here.

985
00:40:57,840 --> 00:40:59,507
Hyunhee, you're hooked.

986
00:40:59,507 --> 00:41:01,840
And isn't it more tender than braised beef?

987
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:03,173
It's because it's pork.

988
00:41:04,140 --> 00:41:06,773
That must be delicious, but why are you getting angry?

989
00:41:08,373 --> 00:41:10,873
- It was so good. / - She licked the bowl clean.

990
00:41:10,873 --> 00:41:13,107
- It'd be so good. / - I ate it all.

991
00:41:13,107 --> 00:41:14,607
The Dongpo pork was really good.

992
00:41:14,607 --> 00:41:17,740
- That was so good. / - You should've ordered a few more.

993
00:41:17,740 --> 00:41:18,873
The skin is good too.

994
00:41:19,773 --> 00:41:20,973
It melts.

995
00:41:21,607 --> 00:41:23,907
(Toad Tour kept on eating even after that)

996
00:41:23,907 --> 00:41:26,073
She ate a lot of the meat.

997
00:41:26,073 --> 00:41:28,807
- I've never seen her eat that much. / - Exactly.

998
00:41:29,307 --> 00:41:30,973
I really enjoyed this meal.

999
00:41:30,973 --> 00:41:33,240
This is what's important though.

1000
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:36,473
Is this good enough for us to open our wallet?

1001
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:40,340
I'll listen to it after I have another glass.

1002
00:41:40,340 --> 00:41:44,540
I can't listen to it when I'm sober.

1003
00:41:44,540 --> 00:41:47,907
(Will Sohyun's wallet open wide?)

1004
00:41:47,907 --> 00:41:50,073
- Did she open it? / - She has to pay for it.

1005
00:41:55,773 --> 00:41:58,740
(What will happen to these three?)

1006
00:41:59,073 --> 00:42:02,107
I'll open my wallet.

1007
00:42:02,107 --> 00:42:04,740
- I mean, she did eat a lot. / - I'll open my wallet.

1008
00:42:04,740 --> 00:42:06,740
- There you go. That's only fair. / - She should.

1009
00:42:06,740 --> 00:42:08,640
Everything was good.

1010
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:11,040
Not only did she open it, but she spat out the money.

1011
00:42:11,607 --> 00:42:14,207
- It spat it out in one go. / - It spat out the money.

1012
00:42:14,207 --> 00:42:17,873
Tomorrow, we should enjoy the splendor of the city.

1013
00:42:17,873 --> 00:42:19,307
You'll like that.

1014
00:42:19,307 --> 00:42:22,673
I'm going to look very fancy tomorrow.

1015
00:42:22,673 --> 00:42:25,273
After we enjoy the nature,

1016
00:42:25,273 --> 00:42:26,840
we'll enjoy the city within the city.

1017
00:42:27,507 --> 00:42:29,307
It's a very fancy city.

1018
00:42:29,307 --> 00:42:31,373
I like the city center.

1019
00:42:31,373 --> 00:42:32,673
I'm so curious.

1020
00:42:32,673 --> 00:42:34,073
Hey, I'm getting excited.

1021
00:42:35,007 --> 00:42:36,407
Help me!

1022
00:42:36,407 --> 00:42:38,440
I love that kind of activity. I love it.

1023
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:40,407
- My gosh, look at that. / - What's that?

1024
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:42,273
Look at that!

1025
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:44,173
That's really delicious.

1026
00:42:44,173 --> 00:42:46,573
- What are you doing to us? / - What is that?

1027
00:42:47,707 --> 00:42:51,107
I strongly recommend that.

1028
00:42:51,107 --> 00:42:52,940
I really want to eat that.

1029
00:42:52,940 --> 00:42:54,540
Wipe your mouths.

1030
00:42:54,540 --> 00:42:55,840
Are they in Hong Kong?

1031
00:42:57,273 --> 00:43:00,073
- It looks like Hong Kong at night. / - It really does.

1032
00:43:00,073 --> 00:43:02,540
This could beat Kyoto.

1033
00:43:02,540 --> 00:43:04,673
It's beyond your imagination.

1034
00:43:04,673 --> 00:43:06,807
And first of all, prices are reasonable there.

1035
00:43:06,807 --> 00:43:07,640
We don't know much...

1036
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:09,407
- About the city. / - Were you there for 3 days?

1037
00:43:09,407 --> 00:43:10,773
Is it because of our low expectation?

1038
00:43:10,773 --> 00:43:12,373
This is so much fun.

1039
00:43:12,373 --> 00:43:15,840
(The morning of the second day breaks without fail)

1040
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:19,440
We went around the city center.

1041
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:21,540
It's similar to Seoul.

1042
00:43:21,540 --> 00:43:22,407
It's just a city.

1043
00:43:22,407 --> 00:43:23,273
What about the weather?

1044
00:43:23,273 --> 00:43:26,307
It's similar to Seoul but it's slightly warmer.

1045
00:43:26,307 --> 00:43:27,840
Early summer weather.

1046
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:28,373
Early summer?

1047
00:43:28,373 --> 00:43:30,840
It's only a 1-hour difference. Why couldn't you sleep?

1048
00:43:30,840 --> 00:43:33,307
Normally, I'd be asleep at this hour.

1049
00:43:33,307 --> 00:43:35,607
But we're on a trip so we have to go for breakfast.

1050
00:43:35,607 --> 00:43:36,940
- It's like this. / - Don't you see my glasses?

1051
00:43:36,940 --> 00:43:39,173
My eyes are so swollen.

1052
00:43:39,173 --> 00:43:40,540
Having breakfast on a trip is

1053
00:43:40,540 --> 00:43:43,373
a chance to become pretentious.

1054
00:43:43,373 --> 00:43:45,973
To me, it's a chance to flaunt.

1055
00:43:45,973 --> 00:43:48,373
If you post this, it will say all about your Hangzhou trip.

1056
00:43:48,373 --> 00:43:51,240
This is the breakfast you must have in Hangzhou.

1057
00:43:51,240 --> 00:43:53,907
That's why I prepared this. It's in the city within the city.

1058
00:43:53,907 --> 00:43:54,973
This is it.

1059
00:43:57,573 --> 00:43:59,307
- Yes, this is quite famous. / - Soy milk.

1060
00:43:59,307 --> 00:44:01,140
It's youtiao and doujiang.

1061
00:44:01,940 --> 00:44:03,573
Oh, my. It's impossible for it to taste bad.

1062
00:44:03,573 --> 00:44:05,607
It's the best combination. It's perfect.

1063
00:44:05,607 --> 00:44:07,440
- I got the chills. It's so good. / - I agree.

1064
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:08,773
Save me.

1065
00:44:08,773 --> 00:44:10,473
You saw this, right?

1066
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:15,107
A lot of Chinese people have that for breakfast.

1067
00:44:15,107 --> 00:44:16,673
It's a very popular dish.

1068
00:44:16,673 --> 00:44:18,607
It'd be great if you get to try this.

1069
00:44:18,607 --> 00:44:21,973
You can have this breakfast at other restaurants too

1070
00:44:21,973 --> 00:44:23,407
but I wanted to eat at

1071
00:44:23,407 --> 00:44:25,573
a restaurant with sophisticated decor.

1072
00:44:25,573 --> 00:44:26,640
I'll explain the menu.

1073
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:28,240
The one that people eat the most

1074
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:30,473
is called doujiang. It's bean liquid.

1075
00:44:31,273 --> 00:44:33,073
- It's doujiang. Bean liquid. / - I'm not a fan.

1076
00:44:33,073 --> 00:44:35,007
- Bean liquid? / - I'm not a fan.

1077
00:44:35,007 --> 00:44:37,573
- You don't like soy milk? / - I don't.

1078
00:44:37,573 --> 00:44:40,107
You look like you'd enjoy that. Cold bean noodles.

1079
00:44:40,107 --> 00:44:43,773
I've never paid to eat cold soybean noodles.

1080
00:44:43,773 --> 00:44:46,007
Are you telling me in advance that you won't pay?

1081
00:44:46,007 --> 00:44:47,640
That you won't open your wallet?

1082
00:44:47,640 --> 00:44:48,873
That's not it.

1083
00:44:48,873 --> 00:44:51,340
But I've never paid myself to eat that dish.

1084
00:44:51,340 --> 00:44:53,673
Since you've never had this, it might be different.

1085
00:44:53,673 --> 00:44:55,473
Beans in Korea and beans in China are different.

1086
00:44:55,473 --> 00:44:57,640
My gosh, you're stubborn.

1087
00:44:57,640 --> 00:44:59,407
- Another one is youtiao. / - What's that?

1088
00:44:59,407 --> 00:45:03,207
- It's Chinese twisted breadstick. / - I see.

1089
00:45:03,207 --> 00:45:05,173
Since they go well together,

1090
00:45:05,173 --> 00:45:07,240
you use them to describe a good couple.

1091
00:45:07,240 --> 00:45:08,107
A couple is like those two dishes.

1092
00:45:08,107 --> 00:45:08,840
That's right.

1093
00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:12,473
I was relieved that it wasn't that expensive.

1094
00:45:12,473 --> 00:45:16,573
- I love twisted breadsticks... / - I don't like them.

1095
00:45:18,007 --> 00:45:19,607
(She's in despair, what can she do?)

1096
00:45:19,607 --> 00:45:21,307
I don't like churros.

1097
00:45:21,307 --> 00:45:23,407
It's sweet and delicious, Sohyun.

1098
00:45:23,407 --> 00:45:25,340
- Is it here? / - Here it is.

1099
00:45:25,340 --> 00:45:26,773
- What is that? / - It's good when eaten together.

1100
00:45:26,773 --> 00:45:28,473
When two people make a good couple...

1101
00:45:28,473 --> 00:45:31,473
- They're like youtiao and doujiang. / - Bean soup?

1102
00:45:31,473 --> 00:45:34,040
Do you know home-made tofu?

1103
00:45:34,040 --> 00:45:35,807
- It smells like the home-made tofu. / - Really?

1104
00:45:35,807 --> 00:45:37,273
- It's not soy milk. / - It's the real stuff then.

1105
00:45:37,273 --> 00:45:40,840
- Like when we go to Gangwon-do. / - It's rich.

1106
00:45:40,840 --> 00:45:42,473
Does it taste like soy milk?

1107
00:45:42,473 --> 00:45:44,673
- Yes. / - No, it's different from Seoul.

1108
00:45:44,673 --> 00:45:46,873
It's the bean liquid without any seasoning.

1109
00:45:46,873 --> 00:45:48,340
- Really? / - No seasoning at all.

1110
00:45:48,340 --> 00:45:50,773
- It's sweet. / - It's slightly sweet.

1111
00:45:50,773 --> 00:45:53,807
- It's sweet ground bean liquid. / - It's sweet.

1112
00:45:53,807 --> 00:45:55,640
The color looks so pretty.

1113
00:45:56,340 --> 00:45:58,540
This does taste sweet.

1114
00:45:58,540 --> 00:46:01,873
Besides, it was warm too.

1115
00:46:02,407 --> 00:46:03,407
It's good.

1116
00:46:03,407 --> 00:46:04,973
Did you like it, Hyunhee?

1117
00:46:04,973 --> 00:46:05,907
I loved it.

1118
00:46:05,907 --> 00:46:06,973
You're not drinking rice wine, right?

1119
00:46:06,973 --> 00:46:08,573
It smells like tofu.

1120
00:46:08,573 --> 00:46:11,140
- The soup is really rich. Right? / - Yes.

1121
00:46:11,140 --> 00:46:15,273
Since we had doujiang, we should try this.

1122
00:46:15,273 --> 00:46:17,340
- It's Chinese churros. / - I want to try that.

1123
00:46:17,340 --> 00:46:18,840
That's so big.

1124
00:46:18,840 --> 00:46:22,307
- How much was the bread? / - That was $1.

1125
00:46:22,307 --> 00:46:23,773
- That? / - That's only $1?

1126
00:46:23,773 --> 00:46:26,173
Everyone, the whole set costs $2.40.

1127
00:46:26,173 --> 00:46:30,040
Hangzhou is famous for these breadsticks.

1128
00:46:30,040 --> 00:46:31,807
The breadstick was eaten only in certain regions.

1129
00:46:31,807 --> 00:46:35,073
When it got popular, people throughout China

1130
00:46:35,073 --> 00:46:37,507
started eating it for breakfast.

1131
00:46:38,407 --> 00:46:39,640
It's good.

1132
00:46:39,640 --> 00:46:41,273
- It was crispy. / - They must fry the sticks daily.

1133
00:46:41,273 --> 00:46:43,473
- Was the breadstick good? / - It was good.

1134
00:46:43,473 --> 00:46:44,940
- It's so soft. / - It looks like a churro.

1135
00:46:44,940 --> 00:46:47,273
But like French bread, it's very chewy.

1136
00:46:47,273 --> 00:46:48,740
Since it's fried, it must be similar to a croissant.

1137
00:46:48,740 --> 00:46:50,073
- That's right. / - Exactly.

1138
00:46:50,073 --> 00:46:51,273
It's really good.

1139
00:46:51,273 --> 00:46:53,173
The breadstick itself is good.

1140
00:46:53,173 --> 00:46:55,740
I heard that it's delicious with doujiang too.

1141
00:46:56,540 --> 00:46:59,140
- Sohyun, this is so moist. / - When you dip it in?

1142
00:47:00,407 --> 00:47:02,407
In Korea, churros are hard.

1143
00:47:02,407 --> 00:47:04,607
They won't absorb the liquid.

1144
00:47:04,607 --> 00:47:06,440
When you eat cereals with milk,

1145
00:47:06,440 --> 00:47:10,807
the milk becomes sweet. It tastes like that.

1146
00:47:10,807 --> 00:47:13,740
- It tastes like soymilk. / - Exactly.

1147
00:47:15,473 --> 00:47:17,240
- This is the right way to eat it. / - Really?

1148
00:47:17,240 --> 00:47:18,740
You have to soak it?

1149
00:47:18,740 --> 00:47:21,107
At first, you should just tear it and eat it alone.

1150
00:47:21,107 --> 00:47:23,273
- I think you can find this in Korea too. / - Then...

1151
00:47:23,273 --> 00:47:25,907
But it's way cheaper there than in Korea.

1152
00:47:26,540 --> 00:47:28,107
- Do you like it? / - It's delicious.

1153
00:47:29,873 --> 00:47:31,273
- Today... / - There's the frog purse.

1154
00:47:31,273 --> 00:47:32,840
The thing is...

1155
00:47:33,873 --> 00:47:36,507
I prepared a fancy city tour.

1156
00:47:36,507 --> 00:47:38,340
It requires a lot of money.

1157
00:47:38,340 --> 00:47:41,440
You should be generous and pay for us today.

1158
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:43,373
We should focus on having fun today.

1159
00:47:43,373 --> 00:47:45,807
If we care too much about money, it won't go smoothly.

1160
00:47:45,807 --> 00:47:48,573
- Really? / - Yes. It will ruin our mood.

1161
00:47:48,573 --> 00:47:51,607
- Then I will just pay for myself. / - Only herself?

1162
00:47:52,740 --> 00:47:54,007
That was the first time.

1163
00:47:54,007 --> 00:47:56,107
But you recommended what you must try in China.

1164
00:47:56,107 --> 00:47:57,373
I know.

1165
00:47:58,340 --> 00:47:59,673
I'll just pay for myself.

1166
00:48:00,573 --> 00:48:01,873
Just mine.

1167
00:48:01,873 --> 00:48:04,940
I gave you soy milk and youtiao this morning.

1168
00:48:04,940 --> 00:48:05,573
What are you saying?

1169
00:48:05,573 --> 00:48:08,640
But look. You ate it all.

1170
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:10,640
You ate everything.

1171
00:48:11,240 --> 00:48:13,173
(Sohyun doesn't want to open her purse)

1172
00:48:14,307 --> 00:48:16,673
(I can't let her purse stay closed like this)

1173
00:48:18,140 --> 00:48:21,440
(I've got to open that mouth!)

1174
00:48:23,007 --> 00:48:24,907
(What will she do at a last resort?)

1175
00:48:24,907 --> 00:48:28,140
- What if I show you a talent? / - A talent?

1176
00:48:28,140 --> 00:48:31,607
- That's going to soften me up. / - Since you won't pay...

1177
00:48:31,607 --> 00:48:33,673
- Since we're in China... / - Show us.

1178
00:48:33,673 --> 00:48:34,973
- I'll do BewhY. / - Yes, do BewhY.

1179
00:48:34,973 --> 00:48:35,740
- BewhY? /- Show us BewhY.

1180
00:48:35,740 --> 00:48:37,207
I'm grateful to BewhY.

1181
00:48:37,207 --> 00:48:39,307
- Could you do this? / - This is BewhY drinking soymilk.

1182
00:48:39,307 --> 00:48:40,740
BewhY drinking soymilk?

1183
00:48:40,740 --> 00:48:43,273
It's BewhY.

1184
00:48:43,273 --> 00:48:46,707
The best people know what the best things are.

1185
00:48:48,107 --> 00:48:50,207
- They look alike. / - They do.

1186
00:48:50,707 --> 00:48:53,673
- They do. / - Sohyun loves it.

1187
00:48:55,007 --> 00:48:56,140
The real people know what the real things are.

1188
00:48:56,140 --> 00:48:59,040
- They look alike. / - They do.

1189
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:00,840
The real people know what the real things are.

1190
00:49:08,540 --> 00:49:09,040
Hyunhee...

1191
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:11,207
I'm ToadwhY

1192
00:49:11,207 --> 00:49:13,740
I'm sorry, but I really don't like the bean soup.

1193
00:49:14,573 --> 00:49:16,307
The bean soup...

1194
00:49:16,307 --> 00:49:17,673
Okay, fine then.

1195
00:49:17,673 --> 00:49:19,807
- Because after this... / - I have to be honest.

1196
00:49:19,807 --> 00:49:21,140
- I'm confident. / - So she didn't pay.

1197
00:49:21,140 --> 00:49:25,873
After this, you'll pay even if I tell you not to.

1198
00:49:25,873 --> 00:49:27,573
I gave up on breakfast.

1199
00:49:27,573 --> 00:49:28,807
So the idea was...

1200
00:49:28,807 --> 00:49:31,007
Since you're in Hangzhou, you wanted her

1201
00:49:31,007 --> 00:49:33,707
to try and authentic Hangzhou breakfast.

1202
00:49:33,707 --> 00:49:36,573
- That's what it was. / - That's how it started.

1203
00:49:36,573 --> 00:49:39,540
I personally thought it was too strong.

1204
00:49:39,540 --> 00:49:40,673
For me.

1205
00:49:40,673 --> 00:49:43,107
So it smelled too strong of beans.

1206
00:49:43,107 --> 00:49:45,773
I thought she'd at least pay for the churros.

1207
00:49:45,773 --> 00:49:47,440
Hyunhee ate everything in the end.

1208
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:48,907
From what Hyunhee described,

1209
00:49:48,907 --> 00:49:50,540
it looked very delicious.

1210
00:49:51,273 --> 00:49:54,340
(After breakfast, they head out to enjoy downtown)

1211
00:49:56,473 --> 00:49:58,607
Since we had a filling breakfast,

1212
00:49:58,607 --> 00:50:01,473
we should begin the city tour.

1213
00:50:01,473 --> 00:50:04,807
We're going to Song Dynasty Town.

1214
00:50:04,807 --> 00:50:07,340
This place was really fun, Song Dynasty Town.

1215
00:50:07,340 --> 00:50:11,573
In Yongin, we have a theme park like this.

1216
00:50:11,573 --> 00:50:12,740
Look at the fire show in the middle of the day.

1217
00:50:12,740 --> 00:50:15,140
They recreated the fortress from Southern Song Dynasty.

1218
00:50:15,140 --> 00:50:19,073
- It's like Folk Village in Korea. / - Oh, Folk Village.

1219
00:50:20,107 --> 00:50:21,773
(Song Dynasty Town)

1220
00:50:21,773 --> 00:50:24,407
China is so big.

1221
00:50:24,407 --> 00:50:27,107
It takes a minimum of 1 hour to go anywhere.

1222
00:50:27,107 --> 00:50:29,940
That's one bad point.

1223
00:50:31,507 --> 00:50:33,207
He's adorable.

1224
00:50:36,107 --> 00:50:38,007
Sohyun, look.

1225
00:50:38,007 --> 00:50:39,440
How do you feel?

1226
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:41,440
As you know, Hangzhou was

1227
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:43,073
the capital city of Song Dynasty.

1228
00:50:43,073 --> 00:50:45,573
This is the recreation of the fortress

1229
00:50:45,573 --> 00:50:46,707
of Southern Song Dynasty.

1230
00:50:46,707 --> 00:50:50,173
The entrance fee was about $50.

1231
00:50:50,173 --> 00:50:51,107
It's exciting.

1232
00:50:51,107 --> 00:50:52,940
- I love theme parks. / - Let's go in.

1233
00:50:52,940 --> 00:50:56,307
Since it's so hot, I have a present for you.

1234
00:50:56,807 --> 00:50:59,507
It's so sunny today.

1235
00:50:59,507 --> 00:51:01,473
NCT will protect me from the sun.

1236
00:51:02,840 --> 00:51:04,207
NCT will protect me from the sun.

1237
00:51:04,940 --> 00:51:06,207
It's NCT.

1238
00:51:06,207 --> 00:51:08,107
(It's an idol fan)

1239
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:10,940
2018.

1240
00:51:10,940 --> 00:51:14,073
Let's travel with NCT. What do you think?

1241
00:51:14,073 --> 00:51:17,140
We're going to the theme park with 18 NCT members.

1242
00:51:18,207 --> 00:51:19,873
We're group visitors.

1243
00:51:19,873 --> 00:51:22,640
We're a big group. We should get a discount.

1244
00:51:24,107 --> 00:51:27,573
Since we're in the Song Dynasty,

1245
00:51:27,573 --> 00:51:28,773
we should try Song's traditional clothes.

1246
00:51:28,773 --> 00:51:30,840
we should try Song's traditional clothes.

1247
00:51:30,840 --> 00:51:32,507
Is it free?

1248
00:51:32,507 --> 00:51:34,907
It's included in the entrance fee.

1249
00:51:34,907 --> 00:51:37,640
You can rent the clothes with the entrance ticket.

1250
00:51:37,640 --> 00:51:38,907
What do men wear?

1251
00:51:38,907 --> 00:51:40,907
There are men's clothes as well.

1252
00:51:40,907 --> 00:51:42,107
There are clothes for men too.

1253
00:51:42,107 --> 00:51:43,873
- Do they have all the sizes? / - Yes, they do.

1254
00:51:43,873 --> 00:51:47,007
- Even babies... / - You can wear men's clothes.

1255
00:51:47,007 --> 00:51:49,707
- Okay. / - I wore men's clothes.

1256
00:51:49,707 --> 00:51:51,040
Here's your ticket.

1257
00:51:51,773 --> 00:51:53,940
Do they have something really fancy

1258
00:51:53,940 --> 00:51:55,873
or something unique?

1259
00:51:56,640 --> 00:52:00,373
(Special episode, a toad and princess Sohyun)

1260
00:52:00,940 --> 00:52:03,440
Don't I look like Bao Zheng?

1261
00:52:04,507 --> 00:52:07,740
- This is the traditional clothing. / - Chinese zombie?

1262
00:52:07,740 --> 00:52:10,373
Stop that. You're scaring me.

1263
00:52:10,373 --> 00:52:13,440
Let's have fun in these clothes in this theme park.

1264
00:52:14,573 --> 00:52:17,940
It feels like fun Folk Village.

1265
00:52:17,940 --> 00:52:21,007
The lanterns are in the shape of a dragon.

1266
00:52:21,007 --> 00:52:22,540
The theme park was huge.

1267
00:52:23,173 --> 00:52:25,107
- I thought it was CG. / - Huh? CG?

1268
00:52:26,140 --> 00:52:29,607
(A golden dragon cuts across the long alley)

1269
00:52:30,573 --> 00:52:34,140
(You can feel the Song Dynasty from 1,000 years ago)

1270
00:52:34,840 --> 00:52:38,007
When you go to an amusement park in Korea,

1271
00:52:38,007 --> 00:52:39,207
it's full of people.

1272
00:52:39,207 --> 00:52:40,640
- Doesn't this feel like that? / - It's a theme park.

1273
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:43,140
It's crowded and busy.

1274
00:52:43,140 --> 00:52:45,040
It's like an amusement park.

1275
00:52:47,940 --> 00:52:49,773
- What is it? / - I found toads.

1276
00:52:49,773 --> 00:52:51,973
- There are more toads? Where? / - There are toads?

1277
00:52:51,973 --> 00:52:53,440
They have toads there.

1278
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:55,840
My gosh. There are toads.

1279
00:52:55,840 --> 00:52:58,473
They are Hyunhee goods.

1280
00:52:58,473 --> 00:53:01,340
- I met my friends there. / - They sell Hyunhee goods.

1281
00:53:02,240 --> 00:53:04,440
(Croak, croak)

1282
00:53:04,507 --> 00:53:05,740
That sound.

1283
00:53:05,740 --> 00:53:07,607
It makes that sound when you scratch the back.

1284
00:53:09,173 --> 00:53:10,340
(Let me scratch my back too)

1285
00:53:10,340 --> 00:53:11,940
I wanted to test it on myself.

1286
00:53:11,940 --> 00:53:12,873
They sell Hyunhee goods.

1287
00:53:12,873 --> 00:53:14,273
I was so happy to see that.

1288
00:53:14,273 --> 00:53:17,373
They sell various kinds of souvenirs there.

1289
00:53:17,373 --> 00:53:18,273
They sell many souvenirs.

1290
00:53:18,273 --> 00:53:19,773
You shouldn't miss out souvenirs.

1291
00:53:19,773 --> 00:53:21,807
They sell food too.

1292
00:53:21,807 --> 00:53:22,807
What is this?

1293
00:53:24,140 --> 00:53:26,240
- These things are free as well. / - So pretty.

1294
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:27,207
They just give it to people.

1295
00:53:27,207 --> 00:53:29,707
They're for those who put on the traditional clothes.

1296
00:53:31,307 --> 00:53:32,773
That's so pretty.

1297
00:53:34,407 --> 00:53:36,673
- Like this? / - Since we're in the outfits...

1298
00:53:36,673 --> 00:53:38,107
They match the colors as well.

1299
00:53:38,107 --> 00:53:40,207
It'd really make you feel like you're on a holiday.

1300
00:53:40,207 --> 00:53:42,207
This is so much fun to experience.

1301
00:53:44,440 --> 00:53:46,907
- You want to ride this? / - The sedan chair...

1302
00:53:48,973 --> 00:53:51,640
- Sedan chair. / - Let's ride in the sedan chair.

1303
00:53:51,640 --> 00:53:52,340
Get on.

1304
00:53:52,340 --> 00:53:54,740
- Can I? / - He spoke in Korean.

1305
00:53:54,740 --> 00:53:56,773
- You can ride it together. / - We can ride it together.

1306
00:53:56,773 --> 00:53:58,307
- We can ride it together. / - Thank you.

1307
00:54:01,173 --> 00:54:02,140
I'm scared.

1308
00:54:08,507 --> 00:54:11,540
This might look childish, but it's fun.

1309
00:54:11,540 --> 00:54:13,640
- This is fun. / - I didn't expect this.

1310
00:54:14,607 --> 00:54:17,540
I didn't think they could lift me.

1311
00:54:17,540 --> 00:54:18,740
Please hold my hand.

1312
00:54:20,973 --> 00:54:24,007
(It looks like she's on a political campaign)

1313
00:54:24,640 --> 00:54:28,540
- What are you doing there? / - They all greeted me.

1314
00:54:28,540 --> 00:54:30,240
From behind...

1315
00:54:38,007 --> 00:54:40,540
- I feel like I've seen this scene from a movie. / - Me too.

1316
00:54:40,540 --> 00:54:42,440
I think this was on a movie.

1317
00:54:44,907 --> 00:54:47,273
Thank you.

1318
00:54:48,673 --> 00:54:49,940
Thank you.

1319
00:54:50,540 --> 00:54:51,440
It was so much fun.

1320
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:53,073
Did they take pictures for you?

1321
00:54:53,073 --> 00:54:56,007
They asked us to take pictures with them.

1322
00:54:56,007 --> 00:54:57,673
They said Sohyun was so pretty.

1323
00:54:57,673 --> 00:54:59,373
Bye-bye.

1324
00:54:59,807 --> 00:55:01,707
That was fun.

1325
00:55:01,707 --> 00:55:03,640
What on earth is this?

1326
00:55:04,340 --> 00:55:05,373
They have that there?

1327
00:55:06,340 --> 00:55:07,607
It's there.

1328
00:55:07,607 --> 00:55:10,940
I thought I was in a water park.

1329
00:55:10,940 --> 00:55:13,507
(People run and fall)

1330
00:55:14,107 --> 00:55:16,640
(People keep falling into the water)

1331
00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:17,840
His phone, his phone.

1332
00:55:17,840 --> 00:55:19,307
He has to save his phone.

1333
00:55:19,307 --> 00:55:20,673
He must.

1334
00:55:21,240 --> 00:55:22,973
It was so much fun.

1335
00:55:22,973 --> 00:55:25,440
People in China know how to have fun with water.

1336
00:55:27,140 --> 00:55:30,440
This place is really popular

1337
00:55:30,440 --> 00:55:32,607
among young people in Hangzhou.

1338
00:55:32,607 --> 00:55:33,907
They all come here.

1339
00:55:35,207 --> 00:55:36,507
Someone crossed it.

1340
00:55:36,507 --> 00:55:38,240
Someone did it.

1341
00:55:38,240 --> 00:55:41,040
Even this game looks so Chinese.

1342
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:42,273
Perfect.

1343
00:55:42,273 --> 00:55:43,273
Do you want to try this?

1344
00:55:43,273 --> 00:55:44,573
- No way. / - Try it.

1345
00:55:44,573 --> 00:55:45,840
For me...

1346
00:55:45,840 --> 00:55:46,973
Look! A child is doing it.

1347
00:55:46,973 --> 00:55:47,973
It made me want to try.

1348
00:55:47,973 --> 00:55:50,173
- It looked so fun. / - She's really good.

1349
00:55:51,740 --> 00:55:53,673
- Children are light. / - Right.

1350
00:55:53,673 --> 00:55:55,340
Then I can't do it.

1351
00:55:55,340 --> 00:55:56,740
Should we try this or that?

1352
00:55:56,740 --> 00:55:58,073
They're so good.

1353
00:55:58,073 --> 00:55:59,807
- I can't choose. / - You do this one.

1354
00:55:59,807 --> 00:56:01,940
I think you'll fall in the water for sure.

1355
00:56:03,073 --> 00:56:05,873
I wish someone would help me too.

1356
00:56:05,873 --> 00:56:07,407
Please hurry up?

1357
00:56:07,407 --> 00:56:09,173
You don't want to get stuck behind someone.

1358
00:56:09,173 --> 00:56:12,340
It was actually harder to balance than I thought.

1359
00:56:14,007 --> 00:56:15,707
This is not easy.

1360
00:56:20,073 --> 00:56:21,173
What is this?

1361
00:56:21,173 --> 00:56:22,207
Help me!

1362
00:56:23,240 --> 00:56:26,107
It was almost like a guerrilla training.

1363
00:56:26,107 --> 00:56:27,673
What is that?

1364
00:56:27,673 --> 00:56:29,040
Did you fall in the water?

1365
00:56:34,040 --> 00:56:35,440
(Splits)

1366
00:56:37,073 --> 00:56:39,940
Hyunhee, watch your legs!

1367
00:56:39,940 --> 00:56:41,573
- Hyunhee. / - Help me!

1368
00:56:42,873 --> 00:56:45,807
(When she thought she was safe)

1369
00:56:45,807 --> 00:56:47,773
This is hard.

1370
00:56:48,240 --> 00:56:50,407
It's too late to quit now.

1371
00:56:52,007 --> 00:56:53,273
I can't go further.

1372
00:56:53,273 --> 00:56:57,340
- Don't shake it. Don't shake it. / - I can't do this.

1373
00:56:57,940 --> 00:57:00,540
- You shouldn't go that way. / - Where should I go?

1374
00:57:02,973 --> 00:57:04,773
Where are you going?

1375
00:57:04,773 --> 00:57:07,273
- Hyunhee. / - What' with your red pants?

1376
00:57:07,707 --> 00:57:09,373
(Splits)

1377
00:57:09,373 --> 00:57:11,773
Help me!

1378
00:57:11,773 --> 00:57:12,707
Where are you going?

1379
00:57:12,707 --> 00:57:14,040
- Help me! / - Oh, no.

1380
00:57:14,040 --> 00:57:15,873
She's going to fall.

1381
00:57:15,873 --> 00:57:17,340
She's very flexible.

1382
00:57:17,340 --> 00:57:18,773
- Help me! / - Oh, no.

1383
00:57:20,473 --> 00:57:21,673
Oh, no.

1384
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:25,473
And that man in the background fell into the water.

1385
00:57:27,373 --> 00:57:28,573
Help me.

1386
00:57:30,440 --> 00:57:31,873
Somebody came to help her.

1387
00:57:31,873 --> 00:57:34,140
I tried a bit and gave up halfway.

1388
00:57:34,140 --> 00:57:36,273
It was too difficult. I got tired.

1389
00:57:36,273 --> 00:57:37,407
What's wrong with you, Sohyun?

1390
00:57:37,407 --> 00:57:39,240
Hyunhee's the one that really needs help.

1391
00:57:39,240 --> 00:57:41,707
- You made the toad do it. / - Exactly.

1392
00:57:41,707 --> 00:57:44,273
Hyunhee, why did you want to do this in the first place?

1393
00:57:44,273 --> 00:57:45,973
I'm almost there.

1394
00:57:46,673 --> 00:57:48,407
She doesn't give up though.

1395
00:57:48,407 --> 00:57:50,673
- I'm almost there. / - You're almost there.

1396
00:57:50,673 --> 00:57:53,373
Grab two swings at the same time.

1397
00:57:53,373 --> 00:57:55,640
Here. Grab this. Grab this.

1398
00:57:55,640 --> 00:57:58,673
- Grab this. / - How can I grab that?

1399
00:57:59,340 --> 00:58:00,440
It's not like I don't want to do it.

1400
00:58:00,440 --> 00:58:02,107
You want to but you just can't.

1401
00:58:02,107 --> 00:58:04,007
It's easier said than done.

1402
00:58:05,373 --> 00:58:06,673
My goodness.

1403
00:58:08,073 --> 00:58:09,773
Oh, no.

1404
00:58:10,407 --> 00:58:11,573
Oh, no.

1405
00:58:11,807 --> 00:58:12,907
In the end...

1406
00:58:17,073 --> 00:58:19,707
(Splash)

1407
00:58:22,740 --> 00:58:24,307
- Oh, no. / - Why did I go in?

1408
00:58:24,307 --> 00:58:26,573
Why is it so deep for me?

1409
00:58:26,573 --> 00:58:27,973
The writers told me it's knee-deep,

1410
00:58:27,973 --> 00:58:29,640
but it was thigh-deep for me.

1411
00:58:31,573 --> 00:58:33,573
Hyunhee. Hyunhee.

1412
00:58:33,573 --> 00:58:35,007
I'm a toad in the water.

1413
00:58:35,007 --> 00:58:36,973
Let me help you, Hyunhee.

1414
00:58:36,973 --> 00:58:38,440
It's okay. I will do it myself.

1415
00:58:38,440 --> 00:58:41,240
The problem is you can't climb up on the swing.

1416
00:58:42,340 --> 00:58:43,673
Why not just come out?

1417
00:58:43,673 --> 00:58:46,773
- It's too high. I'm too short. / - It's high.

1418
00:58:47,307 --> 00:58:48,673
Hyunhee.

1419
00:58:48,673 --> 00:58:50,407
I was a bit disappointed then.

1420
00:58:50,407 --> 00:58:51,873
If she wanted to help me,

1421
00:58:51,873 --> 00:58:52,873
she should have moved her body.

1422
00:58:52,873 --> 00:58:55,740
But she just kept saying, "Oh, no."

1423
00:58:55,740 --> 00:58:57,873
"I should help."

1424
00:58:57,873 --> 00:58:59,207
That's actually meaner.

1425
00:58:59,207 --> 00:59:01,007
You're embarrassed of Hyunhee.

1426
00:59:01,007 --> 00:59:02,640
- You didn't help. / - She's embarrassed.

1427
00:59:02,640 --> 00:59:05,607
- I was just an outsider... / - You look angry.

1428
00:59:07,240 --> 00:59:08,673
Like I wasn't with her.

1429
00:59:08,673 --> 00:59:13,340
- I was very embarrassed. / - She was!

1430
00:59:13,340 --> 00:59:16,207
- I was a bit... / - They're having fun.

1431
00:59:16,973 --> 00:59:20,007
- I can't lift her up. / - What are you doing?

1432
00:59:20,007 --> 00:59:21,973
No one's helping out.

1433
00:59:21,973 --> 00:59:24,240
Here's someone.

1434
00:59:27,740 --> 00:59:29,340
A prince turned up.

1435
00:59:29,340 --> 00:59:32,307
- You couldn't climb up? / - You can't.

1436
00:59:37,607 --> 00:59:38,807
Thank you.

1437
00:59:38,807 --> 00:59:40,607
Aren't you meant to marry him now?

1438
00:59:40,607 --> 00:59:44,173
- Such a nice person. / - We were so thankful.

1439
00:59:44,173 --> 00:59:45,673
When you were saying, "Help me..."

1440
00:59:45,673 --> 00:59:48,207
Everyone ignored you. Only he helped out.

1441
00:59:48,207 --> 00:59:50,173
- They all laughed. / - You ignored her the most.

1442
00:59:52,373 --> 00:59:53,740
Why did you say that?

1443
00:59:53,740 --> 00:59:55,573
Let's get dried first. Come with me.

1444
00:59:55,573 --> 00:59:57,173
Do we have a dryer?

1445
00:59:57,173 --> 00:59:58,773
I'm not sure if we do. Let's go anyway.

1446
00:59:58,773 --> 01:00:00,473
There were many people who fell into the water like you.

1447
01:00:00,473 --> 01:00:02,440
She rented the clothes and they're now all soaked.

1448
01:00:02,440 --> 01:00:04,140
You might be surprised to hear this.

1449
01:00:04,140 --> 01:00:06,040
There's a place where you can dry your clothes.

1450
01:00:06,040 --> 01:00:08,740
- They dry your clothes for you. / - It was great.

1451
01:00:08,740 --> 01:00:10,507
Don't you worry and just have fun.

1452
01:00:10,940 --> 01:00:12,240
Here it is.

1453
01:00:14,740 --> 01:00:17,107
There you go. Give him your socks too.

1454
01:00:17,107 --> 01:00:18,773
You can even dry your shoes.

1455
01:00:18,773 --> 01:00:19,807
- Really? / - Yes.

1456
01:00:19,807 --> 01:00:20,407
It's all for free.

1457
01:00:20,407 --> 01:00:22,607
You need to wait for them to dry.

1458
01:00:22,607 --> 01:00:26,540
- I will dry my shoes. / - Dry them in the sun.

1459
01:00:26,540 --> 01:00:30,740
Sohyun, there are so many young people here.

1460
01:00:30,740 --> 01:00:32,373
I felt like I was in an amusement park in Korea.

1461
01:00:32,373 --> 01:00:33,540
The important thing is whether

1462
01:00:33,540 --> 01:00:34,807
you will open your purse or not.

1463
01:00:34,807 --> 01:00:38,240
We paid for the entrance fee and the concert.

1464
01:00:38,240 --> 01:00:39,740
You should pay for everything.

1465
01:00:39,740 --> 01:00:42,807
I think she would even if it's because she feels bad.

1466
01:00:42,807 --> 01:00:44,373
Look. Listen to this.

1467
01:00:44,373 --> 01:00:46,507
It's the toad instrument from earlier.

1468
01:00:47,640 --> 01:00:51,340
- I will... / - It's open.

1469
01:00:51,340 --> 01:00:52,907
- She has to. / - But...

1470
01:00:53,740 --> 01:00:54,707
How much is it?

1471
01:00:54,707 --> 01:00:57,040
You gave me such big laughs so it's worth it.

1472
01:00:57,040 --> 01:00:59,107
Wait, Sohyun. This is...

1473
01:00:59,107 --> 01:01:02,440
The entry is 310 yuan per person.

1474
01:01:02,440 --> 01:01:03,707
You have to pay for me as well.

1475
01:01:03,707 --> 01:01:05,540
Please pay for me.

1476
01:01:05,540 --> 01:01:08,373
Stop trying to rip me off.

1477
01:01:08,373 --> 01:01:10,207
- Did you not have enough money? / - So cute.

1478
01:01:10,207 --> 01:01:12,007
She doesn't have enough money.

1479
01:01:12,807 --> 01:01:14,673
There must be ATMs here.

1480
01:01:14,673 --> 01:01:16,440
There are no ATMs here.

1481
01:01:16,440 --> 01:01:17,473
Then let's do it this way.

1482
01:01:17,473 --> 01:01:19,740
You go check if the clothes are now dried.

1483
01:01:22,007 --> 01:01:22,907
Geez.

1484
01:01:22,907 --> 01:01:25,440
She only paid for her own entrance fee.

1485
01:01:25,440 --> 01:01:27,840
Are you sure you're grateful to her?

1486
01:01:28,840 --> 01:01:30,140
Hyunhee, did you not bring any money?

1487
01:01:30,140 --> 01:01:32,507
- No, she didn't. / - I don't have money.

1488
01:01:32,507 --> 01:01:33,807
She didn't bring any money.

1489
01:01:34,440 --> 01:01:35,940
Only I brought money.

1490
01:01:36,873 --> 01:01:38,040
It's so much fun.

1491
01:01:41,973 --> 01:01:43,473
A toad that returns the favor.

1492
01:01:43,473 --> 01:01:44,840
Quiet and throbbing...

1493
01:01:44,840 --> 01:01:49,007
Toad Tour.

1494
01:01:49,973 --> 01:01:53,040
Whenever I did that, Chinese people laughed.

1495
01:01:53,040 --> 01:01:55,140
I want to be a comedian in China.

1496
01:01:55,140 --> 01:01:57,107
(Toad Tour, day 2)

1497
01:01:57,107 --> 01:02:00,473
(Hangzhou Feast)

1498
01:02:00,873 --> 01:02:06,540
(30 minutes from the theme park to restaurant)

1499
01:02:06,540 --> 01:02:08,273
Which restaurant are we going today?

1500
01:02:08,273 --> 01:02:10,607
We went to the theme park so we're very hungry.

1501
01:02:10,607 --> 01:02:13,440
- We're going to eat kaoyu. / - Kaoyu.

1502
01:02:13,440 --> 01:02:16,573
It's the most popular dish in China nowadays.

1503
01:02:17,440 --> 01:02:20,140
- So that's kaoyu. / - That's spicy peppers on top.

1504
01:02:20,140 --> 01:02:21,607
Spicy peppers.

1505
01:02:21,607 --> 01:02:23,707
You know how tender bass is.

1506
01:02:23,707 --> 01:02:28,340
- It's like a braised dish. / - I could eat that till I drop.

1507
01:02:28,340 --> 01:02:29,807
That kind of dish...

1508
01:02:29,807 --> 01:02:32,773
And there are pictures on the menu.

1509
01:02:32,773 --> 01:02:34,640
It makes it easy for us to order.

1510
01:02:34,640 --> 01:02:36,040
It's easy to pick and order food.

1511
01:02:36,040 --> 01:02:38,507
- Sohyun, come here. / - What is this?

1512
01:02:40,240 --> 01:02:44,473
Have you ever seen such a big cauldron?

1513
01:02:44,473 --> 01:02:44,873
I have never.

1514
01:02:44,873 --> 01:02:45,840
Is there fish inside?

1515
01:02:45,840 --> 01:02:47,973
They grill the fish in it

1516
01:02:47,973 --> 01:02:48,773
and then braise it again.

1517
01:02:48,773 --> 01:02:50,107
So they grill the fish first and...

1518
01:02:50,107 --> 01:02:53,207
First, they grill the fish and then braise the fish.

1519
01:02:53,807 --> 01:02:56,007
It doesn't have a fishy odor.

1520
01:02:56,007 --> 01:02:57,107
They get rid of the odor when they grill the fish.

1521
01:02:57,107 --> 01:02:57,707
It looks so delicious.

1522
01:02:57,707 --> 01:03:00,707
Sook, you'd really love it.

1523
01:03:00,707 --> 01:03:01,440
No, no.

1524
01:03:01,440 --> 01:03:02,707
It's here.

1525
01:03:03,707 --> 01:03:04,940
It's here.

1526
01:03:05,840 --> 01:03:07,873
- That's a huge portion. / - Oh, wow.

1527
01:03:07,873 --> 01:03:10,240
- It's perfect for the Korean palette. / - It is.

1528
01:03:10,240 --> 01:03:12,107
- Peppers. / - Garlic too.

1529
01:03:12,107 --> 01:03:14,507
In Korea, we braise mackerel on radish.

1530
01:03:14,507 --> 01:03:16,473
In China, they braise fish on lotus root.

1531
01:03:16,473 --> 01:03:18,707
- Lotus root. / - They cook the fish on lotus root.

1532
01:03:18,707 --> 01:03:20,107
Lotus root adds the savory taste to the food.

1533
01:03:20,107 --> 01:03:22,040
It's so good.

1534
01:03:22,040 --> 01:03:23,740
Let me try the skin first.

1535
01:03:23,740 --> 01:03:25,207
I love fish skin. It looks delicious.

1536
01:03:25,207 --> 01:03:27,840
The onions and garlic on top...

1537
01:03:27,840 --> 01:03:30,240
It's just like Korean food.

1538
01:03:30,240 --> 01:03:30,673
Hyunhee.

1539
01:03:30,673 --> 01:03:33,707
My mouth keeps watering now.

1540
01:03:33,707 --> 01:03:36,173
This is the best fish skin I have ever had.

1541
01:03:36,173 --> 01:03:39,373
It's crispy, because it was grilled in the caldron.

1542
01:03:42,373 --> 01:03:45,473
As you know, sauces in Korea are sweet.

1543
01:03:45,473 --> 01:03:46,940
This isn't that sweet.

1544
01:03:47,673 --> 01:03:50,540
It's seasoned with chili pepper powder.

1545
01:03:50,540 --> 01:03:52,540
It's like homemade food.

1546
01:03:52,540 --> 01:03:54,607
It's so delicious. My stomach feels comfortable.

1547
01:03:54,607 --> 01:03:57,007
It tastes a bit like spicy rice cakes as well.

1548
01:03:57,007 --> 01:03:59,140
- It tastes like spicy fish stew. / - Spicy rice cakes...

1549
01:03:59,140 --> 01:04:00,573
It must be like spicy fish stew.

1550
01:04:00,573 --> 01:04:01,940
It goes well with Kaoliang wine.

1551
01:04:01,940 --> 01:04:02,807
It's spicy like Korean food.

1552
01:04:02,807 --> 01:04:05,340
You can't stop eating rice with this dish.

1553
01:04:05,340 --> 01:04:07,407
It makes you want rice. It's so delicious.

1554
01:04:07,407 --> 01:04:09,240
I love that look.

1555
01:04:09,240 --> 01:04:12,207
It was so easy to bone the fish.

1556
01:04:12,207 --> 01:04:13,773
- Is the meat chewy? / - It's so meaty.

1557
01:04:13,773 --> 01:04:16,007
Because it's so easy to bone the fish,

1558
01:04:16,007 --> 01:04:18,440
you can just eat it as if it's salmon steak.

1559
01:04:18,440 --> 01:04:20,307
This is a completely hot place.

1560
01:04:20,307 --> 01:04:22,473
I'll pay for everything.

1561
01:04:22,473 --> 01:04:24,640
- Even before I ask? / - Yes.

1562
01:04:24,640 --> 01:04:25,707
Just relax and eat.

1563
01:04:25,707 --> 01:04:27,273
- As soon as you ate... / - That was before you finished.

1564
01:04:27,273 --> 01:04:29,407
This should be a bit expensive.

1565
01:04:29,407 --> 01:04:32,107
No, it isn't. We ordered bass and extra ingredients.

1566
01:04:32,107 --> 01:04:33,607
And it was $23.80.

1567
01:04:33,607 --> 01:04:37,173
- Really? / - That's enough for four servings.

1568
01:04:37,173 --> 01:04:39,107
- It's enough food for a family of 4. / - Less than $30.

1569
01:04:39,107 --> 01:04:42,007
Where else will you get a family dinner for $30?

1570
01:04:42,007 --> 01:04:45,207
Today, we enjoyed the fancy part of Hangzhou.

1571
01:04:45,207 --> 01:04:48,173
Just like Hong Kong, Hangzhou also have

1572
01:04:48,173 --> 01:04:50,907
a light show in the middle of the city.

1573
01:04:50,907 --> 01:04:52,173
We must go there.

1574
01:04:52,173 --> 01:04:54,607
- But we should be there on time. / - A light show?

1575
01:04:54,607 --> 01:04:57,507
We don't have much time left.

1576
01:04:57,507 --> 01:04:59,707
So please eat a little faster.

1577
01:05:00,173 --> 01:05:02,107
(Excuse me. You should stop eating now and leave)

1578
01:05:02,107 --> 01:05:04,340
I don't want to waste any of this food.

1579
01:05:04,340 --> 01:05:06,507
- I'm hungry now. / - This is bad.

1580
01:05:06,507 --> 01:05:07,640
The hunger pangs are coming.

1581
01:05:07,640 --> 01:05:08,440
Minkyoung, are you okay?

1582
01:05:08,440 --> 01:05:09,540
I'm hungry.

1583
01:05:09,540 --> 01:05:12,107
- It's evening. / - I'm hungry now.

1584
01:05:12,107 --> 01:05:13,673

1585
01:05:13,673 --> 01:05:15,640

1586
01:05:15,640 --> 01:05:16,573
(Light Show)

1587
01:05:16,573 --> 01:05:17,373
Light show?

1588
01:05:17,373 --> 01:05:18,607
That show was amazing.

1589
01:05:18,607 --> 01:05:20,807
- That's hip. / - You can fully enjoy the cityscape.

1590
01:05:20,807 --> 01:05:25,240
(23 minutes by car from the restaurant to light show)

1591
01:05:26,140 --> 01:05:28,040
(The sky of Hangzhou gets darker)

1592
01:05:28,040 --> 01:05:28,807
Cityscape.

1593
01:05:28,807 --> 01:05:31,073
The night view there is like that of

1594
01:05:31,073 --> 01:05:33,407
Las Vegas or Hong Kong.

1595
01:05:34,607 --> 01:05:36,507
Sohyun, we don't have much time now.

1596
01:05:36,507 --> 01:05:38,707
We're now in Qianjiang.

1597
01:05:38,707 --> 01:05:41,373
- It looks like a city of the future. / - It does.

1598
01:05:41,373 --> 01:05:43,407
It's totally different from what we saw yesterday, right?

1599
01:05:43,407 --> 01:05:46,607
It's fancy and youthful.

1600
01:05:46,607 --> 01:05:48,273
- Qianjiang? / - Qianjiang.

1601
01:05:52,373 --> 01:05:57,373
There are a series of huge skyscrapers.

1602
01:05:57,373 --> 01:06:00,773
How do they connect the image on

1603
01:06:00,773 --> 01:06:01,507
a series of buildings like that?

1604
01:06:01,507 --> 01:06:04,207
I thought there was someone

1605
01:06:04,207 --> 01:06:05,440
turning on and off the lights.

1606
01:06:05,440 --> 01:06:07,340
You thought someone was controlling the fuse box?

1607
01:06:09,340 --> 01:06:10,907
(Qianjiang Light Show)

1608
01:06:10,907 --> 01:06:12,640
You can see the lights on the skyscrapers.

1609
01:06:12,640 --> 01:06:14,507
Do they have this show every day?

1610
01:06:14,507 --> 01:06:16,840
No, only on some days.

1611
01:06:16,840 --> 01:06:18,473
Tuesday, Friday and Saturday.

1612
01:06:18,473 --> 01:06:20,640
They set 700,000 LED lights on the buildings.

1613
01:06:20,640 --> 01:06:23,373
They set 700,000 LED lights on 30 different buildings.

1614
01:06:23,373 --> 01:06:25,440
They set the lights on the buildings.

1615
01:06:25,440 --> 01:06:27,773
Other people are hurrying there for the show as well.

1616
01:06:28,873 --> 01:06:30,173
Sohyun, it'll start in 5 minutes.

1617
01:06:32,473 --> 01:06:33,773
You can sleep if you want.

1618
01:06:34,707 --> 01:06:35,740
She started to feel tired.

1619
01:06:35,740 --> 01:06:37,740
- Of course. / - It was a busy day.

1620
01:06:37,740 --> 01:06:39,307
You must have been tired.

1621
01:06:42,573 --> 01:06:44,873
Today is Sungkyu's birthday.

1622
01:06:44,873 --> 01:06:46,607
My word.

1623
01:06:46,607 --> 01:06:48,440
She has a very good memory.

1624
01:06:48,440 --> 01:06:50,407
- You're amazing. / - Sungkyu.

1625
01:06:50,407 --> 01:06:52,207
You should give him a present.

1626

- It's free. / - That's right.

1632
01:07:08,773 --> 01:07:11,173
You can stop your car and see it if you want.

01:07:11,173 --> 01:07:13,007
- That's pretty. / - What is that?

1634
01:07:14,040 --> 01:07:15,173
What is this?

1635
01:07:16,007 --> 01:07:17,207
What is this?

1636
01:07:19,307 --> 01:07:21,640
- Day and night is completely different. / - It is.

- It's completely downtown. / - It's pretty.

1638
01:07:24,840 --> 01:07:26,640
It's really spectacular.

1639
01:07:26,640 --> 01:07:29,540
The city grew big as it held the G20 summit.

1640
01:07:29,540 --> 01:07:30,940
That's right.

1641
01:07:34,607 --> 01:07:36,173
Is this what it was?

1642
01:07:37,907 --> 01:07:39,340
Buildings become sketchpads.

1643
01:07:39,340 --> 01:07:41,607
Check the weather and find good days.

1644
01:07:41,607 --> 01:07:44,607
It'll be really great to go on a breezy day.

1645
01:07:44,607 --> 01:07:46,140
You can drink beer

1646
01:07:46,140 --> 01:07:48,940
and coffee. It's so cool.

1647
01:07:52,273 --> 01:07:56,673
(2.15km of buildings are lit up)

1648
01:07:57,940 --> 01:08:00,740
It portrayed the four seasons. It was so beautiful.

1649
01:08:00,740 --> 01:08:02,440
Because it's on such a large-scale,

1650
01:08:02,440 --> 01:08:04,673
the show is much bigger than Hong Kong or Macau.

1651
01:08:04,673 --> 01:08:06,607
- Is it bigger? / - I want to go there.

1652
01:08:06,607 --> 01:08:08,607

1654
01:08:11,907 --> 01:08:13,540
- How does it compare? / - It's just as good.

1655
01:08:13,540 --> 01:08:16,807
You won't be disappointed.

1656
01:08:16,807 --> 01:08:18,240
Wow, over there.

1657
01:08:20,407 --> 01:08:23,673
They're doing fireworks here.

1658
01:08:23,673 --> 01:08:26,940
The fireworks are happening on the buildings.

1659
01:08:26,940 --> 01:08:28,773
The light show is unbelievable.

1660
01:08:28,773 --> 01:08:31,773
You're looking at it on TV so you can't tell,

1661
01:08:31,773 --> 01:08:33,973
but the length is amazing.

1662
01:08:33,973 --> 01:08:35,040
It's a grand show.

1663
01:08:35,040 --> 01:08:37,640
It'd be great to go with your lover or friends.

1664
01:08:37,640 --> 01:08:39,840
- Enjoying a beer... / - Yes.

1665
01:08:43,440 --> 01:08:45,340
It must be over.

1666
01:08:46,707 --> 01:08:48,207
Is it over?

1667
01:08:51,073 --> 01:08:52,707
Tonight is our last night here ,right?

1668
01:08:52,707 --> 01:08:53,540
Where are we going?

1669
01:08:53,540 --> 01:08:55,907
We can't stop here.

1670
01:08:55,907 --> 01:08:57,673
Something exciting. It's our last night,

1671
01:08:57,673 --> 01:08:58,940
so we'll party until we drop.

1672
01:08:58,940 --> 01:09:00,773
- You planned it with your style. / - Okay.

1673
01:09:00,773 --> 01:09:02,473
Follow me until the end.

1674
01:09:02,473 --> 01:09:03,873
Let's have fun.

1675
01:09:03,873 --> 01:09:05,540
- Which way are we going? / - Come this way.

1676
01:09:05,540 --> 01:09:06,640
That way?

1677
01:09:12,040 --> 01:09:13,373
I planned it carefully.

1678
01:09:13,373 --> 01:09:14,340
I found a trendy pub.

1679
01:09:14,340 --> 01:09:17,240
Hwijae and Sikyung have to pay attention.

1680
01:09:17,240 --> 01:09:19,107
- I'm paying attention. / - You'll love this place.

1681
01:09:19,107 --> 01:09:20,073
Is this a pub?

1682
01:09:20,073 --> 01:09:23,273
It's our last day, so we should drink up.

1683
01:09:23,273 --> 01:09:25,840
We don't really drink.

1684
01:09:25,840 --> 01:09:27,773
But Sikyung and Hwijae won't be able to leave.

1685
01:09:27,773 --> 01:09:29,640
But Sikyung and Hwijae won't be able to leave.

1686
01:09:29,640 --> 01:09:30,307
I can't believe it's the last night already.

1687
01:09:30,307 --> 01:09:32,207
- I'm still stuck in that fish restaurant. / - Still?

1688
01:09:32,207 --> 01:09:34,540
- I can't leave. / - You'll get drunk there.

1689
01:09:35,440 --> 01:09:38,573
(It's already their last day in Hangzhou)

1690
01:09:39,740 --> 01:09:42,173
This is Nan Shan Lu.

1691
01:09:42,173 --> 01:09:44,673
You know the popular cafes in Garosu-gil

1692
01:09:44,673 --> 01:09:45,840
or Yeonnam-dong.

1693
01:09:45,840 --> 01:09:47,573
- They're really popular. / - Right?

1694
01:09:47,573 --> 01:09:48,773
- Sohyun. / - Yes?

1695
01:09:48,773 --> 01:09:51,407
I told you last time, right?

1696
01:09:51,407 --> 01:09:55,440
Every Hangzhou man that passes by you is rich.

1697
01:09:55,440 --> 01:09:57,340
- Hangzhou men are rich. / - Hangzhou is a rich city.

1698

- There must be a lot of men. / - Really?

1700
01:10:00,973 --> 01:10:01,440
Of course.

1701
01:10:01,440 --> 01:10:02,207
So what if there are a lot of men?

1702
01:10:02,207 --> 01:10:04,307
We can't meet any of them.

1703
01:10:05,073 --> 01:10:07,573
It's our last day. I'm feeling the pressure.

1704
01:10:08,540 --> 01:10:11,107
- From now on... / - Is this a club?

1705
01:10:11,107 --> 01:10:13,573
You can enjoy all 1 , 2, 3, 4 rounds here.

1706
01:10:13,573 --> 01:10:14,840
- All in one place. / - In one place?

1707
01:10:14,840 --> 01:10:16,640
- All kinds of liquor in one place. / - Really?

1708
01:10:16,640 --> 01:10:17,440
What?

1709
01:10:17,440 --> 01:10:19,207
- Is it outdoors? / - It's so pretty.

1710
01:10:19,207 --> 01:10:21,240
We went in there.

1711
01:10:21,240 --> 01:10:21,773
Snap out of it.

1712
01:10:21,773 --> 01:10:22,940
- Is it indoors? / - It's indoors.

1713
01:10:22,940 --> 01:10:24,640
The roof is open.

1714
01:10:24,640 --> 01:10:25,873
You can see the sky.

1715
01:10:25,873 --> 01:10:27,173
Look at the lights.

1716
01:10:27,173 --> 01:10:29,673
Everything is on a large-scale in China.

1717
01:10:29,673 --> 01:10:31,840
Icicles are falling from the sky.

1718
01:10:31,840 --> 01:10:34,573
Tonight is our last night here.

1719
01:10:34,573 --> 01:10:37,540
- Yes. / - It's the last night of Toad Tour.

1720
01:10:37,540 --> 01:10:40,040
I don't want to go to sleep yet.

1721
01:10:40,040 --> 01:10:44,273
Let's share our memories we made in Hangzhou

1722
01:10:44,273 --> 01:10:46,307
and spend the night.

1723
01:10:46,307 --> 01:10:50,273
I took pictures of you candidly during the trip

1724
01:10:50,273 --> 01:10:51,540
and prepared a gift for you.

1725
01:10:51,540 --> 01:10:53,807
- I prepared another gift. / - In Hangzhou?

1726
01:10:53,807 --> 01:10:55,907
- Ta-da. / - What's this?

1727
01:10:55,907 --> 01:10:57,373
- What is this? / - What is it?

1728
01:10:57,373 --> 01:10:59,073
Goodness.

1729
01:10:59,073 --> 01:11:01,707
- When did you take these? / - Toad Tour.

1730
01:11:02,507 --> 01:11:05,840
(Last night, when everyone was asleep)

1731
01:11:06,907 --> 01:11:09,207
I took Polaroid pictures of her.

1732
01:11:09,207 --> 01:11:11,140
- To make her good memories. / - Usually...

1733
01:11:11,140 --> 01:11:14,307
- Husbands do that for their wives. / - Right.

1734
01:11:14,307 --> 01:11:14,873
That's right.

1735
01:11:14,873 --> 01:11:16,207
It was as if I was proposing.

1736
01:11:16,207 --> 01:11:18,240
- She was like a boyfriend. / - Like a proposal.

1737
01:11:18,240 --> 01:11:19,573
Seriously.

1738
01:11:19,573 --> 01:11:21,507
All you need is a ring.

1739
01:11:21,507 --> 01:11:22,340
It was like a proposal.

1740
01:11:22,340 --> 01:11:24,940
I've never had a boyfriend like that,

1741
01:11:24,940 --> 01:11:26,673
but she was like the best boyfriend.

1742
01:11:26,673 --> 01:11:28,740
Hyunhee is so kind and considerate.

1743
01:11:28,740 --> 01:11:31,140
I prepared a gift for you to repay your kindness.

1744
01:11:31,140 --> 01:11:33,507
You even took a picture of the wallet.

1745
01:11:33,507 --> 01:11:34,940
- You're awesome. / - I know.

1746
01:11:34,940 --> 01:11:37,973
I almost cried when we named our tour

1747
01:11:37,973 --> 01:11:39,540
on the first day.

1748
01:11:39,540 --> 01:11:40,707
Look.

1749
01:11:40,707 --> 01:11:41,740
- Ta-da. / - Oh, my.

1750
01:11:41,740 --> 01:11:43,040
You probably didn't know.

1751
01:11:43,673 --> 01:11:45,907
We took these at the West Lake.

1752
01:11:45,907 --> 01:11:47,840
- At Xi Hu. / - That's right.

1753
01:11:47,840 --> 01:11:50,507
- You took that picture for me. / - Yes.

1754
01:11:50,507 --> 01:11:51,407
Oh, my.

1755
01:11:51,407 --> 01:11:52,807
Some pictures were taken without her knowing?

1756
01:11:52,807 --> 01:11:53,673
Yes.

1757
01:11:53,673 --> 01:11:55,073
She's so pretty.

1758
01:11:55,073 --> 01:11:56,173
The pictures look great.

1759
01:11:56,173 --> 01:11:58,307
I thought only I was taking pictures of Hyunhee.

1760
01:11:58,307 --> 01:12:00,773
But Hyunhee took pictures of me too.

1761
01:12:00,773 --> 01:12:01,573
Thank you so much.

1762
01:12:01,573 --> 01:12:04,340
Because you're very forgetful.

1763
01:12:04,340 --> 01:12:04,673
I know.

1764
01:12:04,673 --> 01:12:07,640
You can always look at these and

1765
01:12:07,640 --> 01:12:09,173
be reminded of Hangzhou.

1766
01:12:09,173 --> 01:12:09,740
Goodness.

1767
01:12:09,740 --> 01:12:12,373
I did that so she doesn't forget.

1768
01:12:12,973 --> 01:12:14,173
Hongbin.

1769
01:12:15,107 --> 01:12:16,840
She put that in to grab her attention.

1770
01:12:19,007 --> 01:12:20,607
It's my Hakyeon.

1771
01:12:21,107 --> 01:12:24,540
He loves the idols more than herself.

1772
01:12:24,540 --> 01:12:26,540
I did a great job by putting this picture in here.

1773
01:12:26,540 --> 01:12:28,473
You could've gotten bored of it.

1774
01:12:28,473 --> 01:12:30,607
But you have these too.

1775
01:12:30,607 --> 01:12:31,907
I put them in the perfect spot.

1776
01:12:31,907 --> 01:12:34,607
I want you to look at the photo book

1777
01:12:34,607 --> 01:12:35,573
and remember our trip.

1778
01:12:35,573 --> 01:12:38,373
Thank you so much for putting a book together.

1779
01:12:38,373 --> 01:12:41,673
I don't want her to forget.

1780
01:12:41,673 --> 01:12:45,473
We shared our memories in Hangzhou, China.

1781
01:12:45,473 --> 01:12:47,173
How meaningful is that?

1782
01:12:47,173 --> 01:12:49,607
I prepared an album hoping that she wouldn't forget.

1783
01:12:49,607 --> 01:12:50,840
That's why I prepared the album.

1784
01:12:50,840 --> 01:12:55,140
Trips with older friends really last.

1785
01:12:55,140 --> 01:12:56,540
That's so true.

1786
01:12:56,540 --> 01:12:58,240
I was so moved.

1787
01:12:58,240 --> 01:12:58,940
I was surprised.

1788
01:12:58,940 --> 01:13:03,173
I wondered why she insisted on taking Polaroids

1789
01:13:03,173 --> 01:13:05,940
instead of using a mobile phone.

1790
01:13:05,940 --> 01:13:07,573
But on the last day,

1791
01:13:07,573 --> 01:13:10,440
she prepared a photo book for me.

1792
01:13:10,440 --> 01:13:12,973
I was so touched by that.

1793
01:13:14,707 --> 01:13:17,073
"Hangzhou is what I miss the most."

1794
01:13:17,073 --> 01:13:19,740
I think I'm going to miss this time in Hangzhou

1795
01:13:19,740 --> 01:13:21,773
I spent with you.

1796
01:13:21,773 --> 01:13:24,273
We'll have to come back then.

1797
01:13:24,273 --> 01:13:25,807
A toad that returns the favor.

1798
01:13:25,807 --> 01:13:26,973
Quiet and throbbing...

1799
01:13:26,973 --> 01:13:28,573
Toad Tour.

1800
01:13:28,573 --> 01:13:30,207
Cheers.

1801
01:13:30,207 --> 01:13:32,573
It's already our last night.

1802
01:13:32,573 --> 01:13:34,073
Do you want to stay one more night?

1803
01:13:34,073 --> 01:13:35,173
With me?

1804
01:13:36,007 --> 01:13:39,540
(The toad and the princess lived happily ever after)

1805
01:13:40,873 --> 01:13:42,373
I miss it already.

1806
01:13:42,373 --> 01:13:45,873
I've been to Shanghai, Beijing,

1807
01:13:45,873 --> 01:13:47,307
and Guangzhou.

1808
01:13:47,307 --> 01:13:48,373
But I really want to go there.

1809
01:13:48,373 --> 01:13:50,007
- It seems really trendy, right? / - It's seems so nice.

1810
01:13:50,007 --> 01:13:52,340
It completely changed my idea about Hangzhou.

1811
01:13:52,340 --> 01:13:54,873
There was a performance that made Sohyun cry.

1812
01:13:54,873 --> 01:13:57,407
- That's an upgraded show. / - Yes.

1813
01:13:57,407 --> 01:14:00,607
It's directed by Zhang Yimou.

1814
01:14:00,607 --> 01:14:04,273
It's on a large-scale.

1815
01:14:04,273 --> 01:14:07,307
And it's something we have never seen.

1816
01:14:07,307 --> 01:14:11,240
They perform "Swan Lake" on a lake.

1817
01:14:11,240 --> 01:14:13,440
So it reminded me of my high school days

1818
01:14:13,440 --> 01:14:16,107
when I was doing ballet.

1819
01:14:16,107 --> 01:14:17,340
It was really moving.

1820
01:14:17,340 --> 01:14:19,007
She kept exclaiming.

1821
01:14:19,007 --> 01:14:21,073
Since we're on a roll, let's talk about food.

1822
01:14:21,073 --> 01:14:22,173
Talk about food.

1823
01:14:22,173 --> 01:14:24,940
Let's talk about Dongpo pork.

1824
01:14:24,940 --> 01:14:26,340
The Dongpo pork sauce looked so good.

1825
01:14:26,340 --> 01:14:27,773
You mixed it with rice and finished it.

1826
01:14:27,773 --> 01:14:29,473
I couldn't waste the sauce.

1827
01:14:29,473 --> 01:14:32,940
I wanted to mix it all up and eat it.

1828
01:14:32,940 --> 01:14:36,040
I love sweet food.

1829
01:14:36,040 --> 01:14:37,873
It was just so good.

1830
01:14:37,873 --> 01:14:39,640
I've never tried in Korea.

1831
01:14:39,640 --> 01:14:41,440
It was my first time trying Dongpo pork.

1832
01:14:41,440 --> 01:14:43,373
I kept thinking about it.

1833
01:14:43,373 --> 01:14:44,940
We'll have the audience vote now.

1834
01:14:44,940 --> 01:14:46,440
- Let's do it. / - My mouth is watering.

1835
01:14:46,440 --> 01:14:49,240
- Let's see the result. / - No, let's check the cost.

1836
01:14:49,240 --> 01:14:51,507
I feel rushed. Everyone is looking pleased.

1837
01:14:51,507 --> 01:14:54,540
I believe their expenses will be competitive too.

1838
01:14:54,540 --> 01:14:57,840
3 days and 2 nights on the Toad Tour.

1839
01:14:57,840 --> 01:15:02,073
Tell us how much your trip cost excluding the flights.

1840
01:15:02,073 --> 01:15:05,573
It cost $289.90 per person.

1841
01:15:05,573 --> 01:15:07,873
Less than $300.

1842
01:15:07,873 --> 01:15:11,373
- That's the most cost effective trip. / - Seriously.

1843
01:15:12,207 --> 01:15:14,040
That's the best.

1844
01:15:14,040 --> 01:15:16,073
You all enjoyed the Hangzhou trip.

1845
01:15:16,073 --> 01:15:20,373
Will you follow the Toad Tour's itinerary to Hangzhou?

1846
01:15:20,373 --> 01:15:21,873
Yes or no?

1847
01:15:21,873 --> 01:15:24,007
Please vote.

1848
01:15:25,040 --> 01:15:28,207
(Toad Tour planned a trip to Hangzhou)

1849
01:15:28,207 --> 01:15:31,707
(What will the judges choose?)

1850
01:15:32,640 --> 01:15:35,040
This week we went to Hangzhou.

1851
01:15:35,040 --> 01:15:36,273
What about next week?

1852
01:15:36,273 --> 01:15:38,840
Next week, we'll go to Kyoto, Japan.

1853
01:15:40,040 --> 01:15:40,673
How exciting.

1854
01:15:40,673 --> 01:15:42,373
- Kim Shinyoung. / - How exciting.

1855
01:15:44,840 --> 01:15:46,940
She's full of energy.

1856
01:15:47,340 --> 01:15:49,173
I'm looking forward to it.

1857
01:15:49,807 --> 01:15:50,707
(Next episode)

1858
01:15:50,707 --> 01:15:53,407
Whether you go... Kyoto! Or don't... Kyoto!

1859
01:15:53,407 --> 01:15:55,773
If you're going to regret, just go!

1860
01:15:55,773 --> 01:15:57,707
- I'll just trust you. / - Just trust me.

1861
01:15:57,707 --> 01:15:58,373
Ta-da.

1862
01:15:59,440 --> 01:16:01,240
I don't think I could forget this.

1863
01:16:01,240 --> 01:16:03,107
This is it.

1864
01:16:04,140 --> 01:16:04,973
Check out the color.

1865
01:16:04,973 --> 01:16:06,307
I'm salivating.

1866
01:16:06,307 --> 01:16:07,973
- Is it good? / - It's so good.

1867
01:16:07,973 --> 01:16:09,373
Right?

1868
01:16:10,273 --> 01:16:10,807
No way!

1869
01:16:10,807 --> 01:16:15,507
- Are you happy? / - I'm happy!

1870
01:16:15,507 --> 01:16:19,273
You'll regret it if you don't come to Kyoto.

1871
01:16:20,040 --> 01:16:37,540
