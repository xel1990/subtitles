Travel is war! Battle Trip!

6
00:00:19,908 --> 00:00:21,375
Nice to meet you.

7
00:00:21,975 --> 00:00:23,375
She's finally here.

8
00:00:23,375 --> 00:00:26,475
Today's special host is Lee Suji.

9
00:00:26,475 --> 00:00:30,342
- Nice to meet you. / - Nice to meet you.

10
00:00:30,342 --> 00:00:32,442
I'm a beautiful comedienne, Lee Suji.

11
00:00:32,442 --> 00:00:33,808
- Good to be here. / - Do you like to travel?

12
00:00:33,808 --> 00:00:35,342
I love to travel so much.

13
00:00:35,342 --> 00:00:37,642
I think there are two types of trips.

14
00:00:37,642 --> 00:00:40,108
The wandering around type and the inner healing type.

15
00:00:40,108 --> 00:00:42,642
I'm here to relax and enjoy the trips like I'm at home.

16
00:00:42,642 --> 00:00:43,242
Yes.

17
00:00:43,242 --> 00:00:47,175
I'll get vicarious enjoyment out of it today.

18
00:00:47,175 --> 00:00:49,742
You're the most popular these days.

19
00:00:49,742 --> 00:00:50,642
What are you talking about?

20
00:00:50,642 --> 00:00:52,475
You're a radio DJ.

21
00:00:52,475 --> 00:00:54,908
Wait, doesn't she have a connection with you?

22
00:00:54,908 --> 00:00:57,042
- She's like a family. / - That's right.

23
00:00:57,042 --> 00:00:57,475
Why?

24
00:00:57,475 --> 00:00:58,675
They have a special relationship.

25
00:00:58,675 --> 00:01:00,675
- We were lovers. / - We acted together once.

26
00:01:00,675 --> 00:01:02,675
- Did you act as lovers? / - Yes.

27
00:01:02,675 --> 00:01:05,908
Sikyung's concerts are full of variety.

28
00:01:05,908 --> 00:01:10,675
He turned a video clip on in the middle of his concert.

29
00:01:10,675 --> 00:01:12,475
- We parodied the drama, "Guardian." / - Yes.

30
00:01:12,475 --> 00:01:15,308
He was Gong Yoo, and I was Kim Goeun.

31
00:01:15,308 --> 00:01:17,175
- You played Goeun? / - Yes.

32
00:01:17,175 --> 00:01:18,475
You were not the goblin?

33
00:01:18,475 --> 00:01:20,908
What are you talking about?

34
00:01:20,908 --> 00:01:23,075
Can't you act out a scene for us?

35
00:01:23,075 --> 00:01:25,775
- Just one scene. / - Should we do it on the side?

36
00:01:25,775 --> 00:01:27,775
- Let's change seats. / - I don't remember the lines.

37
00:01:29,442 --> 00:01:30,642
Here we go.

38
00:01:31,208 --> 00:01:32,342
Okay, the camera is shooting.

39
00:01:32,342 --> 00:01:34,208
And action!

40
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:37,275
Because it's a good day. Because it isn't a good day.

41
00:01:37,275 --> 00:01:39,008
Every day was happy for me.

42
00:01:40,275 --> 00:01:42,275
Who is Nari?

43
00:01:42,275 --> 00:01:44,508
Who is she?

44
00:01:44,508 --> 00:01:47,142
I love you, mister.

45
00:01:48,608 --> 00:01:51,442
- We acted like this. / - It was like this.

46
00:01:51,442 --> 00:01:53,942
- They're really good. / - You have to be shameless.

47
00:01:53,942 --> 00:01:56,975
Okay, what is today's topic for Battle Trip?

48
00:01:56,975 --> 00:01:59,308
For the last 2 weeks, 20-year-olds went on

49
00:01:59,308 --> 00:02:01,375
a domestic spring flower festival trips.

50
00:02:01,375 --> 00:02:02,808
It was so fresh.

51
00:02:02,808 --> 00:02:05,708
It was so nice and full of delicious food.

52
00:02:05,708 --> 00:02:08,675
We'll go to international festivals this time.

53
00:02:09,808 --> 00:02:11,875
It's festival season these days.

54
00:02:11,875 --> 00:02:13,208
Domestically and internationally.

55
00:02:13,208 --> 00:02:15,975
Let's see who went to international festivals today.

56
00:02:15,975 --> 00:02:19,075
Let's meet the trip planners.

57
00:02:19,075 --> 00:02:20,875
Let's have them here.

58
00:02:20,875 --> 00:02:23,642
They planned the international festival trips.

59
00:02:23,642 --> 00:02:25,808
Please come out.

60
00:02:29,675 --> 00:02:31,442
(Hongbin, N of VIXX)

61
00:02:32,175 --> 00:02:34,208
(Sojin of Girl's Day, Shin Ayoung)

62
00:02:36,342 --> 00:02:39,242
I'm curious about something.

63
00:02:39,242 --> 00:02:41,442
Since you're on the same team,

64
00:02:41,442 --> 00:02:43,542
it must have been so fun on your trip.

65
00:02:43,542 --> 00:02:46,908
But Sojin and Ayoung's friendship is unexpected.

66
00:02:46,908 --> 00:02:48,308
- It's unexpected. / - Right?

67
00:02:48,308 --> 00:02:51,842
As far as I know, they aren't close.

68
00:02:52,342 --> 00:02:53,308
How was it?

69
00:02:53,308 --> 00:02:55,808
- We didn't know each other. / - Right?

70
00:02:55,808 --> 00:02:57,108
Really?

71
00:02:57,108 --> 00:03:00,942
People said that we would really get along.

72
00:03:00,942 --> 00:03:02,575
How was it? Did you get along?

73
00:03:02,575 --> 00:03:04,742
- Yes. / - You'll know when you see.

74
00:03:04,742 --> 00:03:07,242
We really enjoyed our trip.

75
00:03:07,242 --> 00:03:08,808
- I think... / - You'll know when you see.

76
00:03:08,808 --> 00:03:10,808
You're just saying that you're close.

77
00:03:10,808 --> 00:03:12,042
It doesn't seem like they

78
00:03:12,042 --> 00:03:13,875
became really close.

79
00:03:13,875 --> 00:03:16,775
Let's see what countries they went

80
00:03:16,775 --> 00:03:17,775
to enjoy festivals.

81
00:03:17,775 --> 00:03:19,908
- Sojin and Ayoung will start. / - Should we start first?

82
00:03:19,908 --> 00:03:23,542
We went to Thingyan, which the New Year celebration.

83
00:03:23,542 --> 00:03:25,875
We went to the city of gold and

84
00:03:25,875 --> 00:03:28,308
the unknown country, Myanmar.

85
00:03:29,142 --> 00:03:30,842
I really like Myanmar.

86
00:03:30,842 --> 00:03:31,442
Really?

87
00:03:31,442 --> 00:03:34,775
- I've always wanted to go to Myanmar. / - Me too.

88
00:03:34,775 --> 00:03:35,542
Yes, Myanmar.

89
00:03:35,542 --> 00:03:37,842
- It's really popular these days. / - It is.

90
00:03:37,842 --> 00:03:39,675
We'll ask our opponents.

91
00:03:39,675 --> 00:03:42,542
We went to Songkran, one of the world's top 10 festivals.

92
00:03:42,542 --> 00:03:45,975
We went to Thailand that boasts various charms.

93
00:03:45,975 --> 00:03:48,475
That festival is really famous.

94
00:03:48,475 --> 00:03:51,575
- People know a lot about Thailand. / - Really famous.

95
00:03:52,042 --> 00:03:54,308
- Already attacking us. / - But Thailand...

96
00:03:54,308 --> 00:03:56,108
Aren't you so curious about Myanmar?

97
00:03:56,108 --> 00:03:59,208
- Thailand's just... / - Songkran is famous.

98
00:03:59,208 --> 00:04:01,242
Songkran festival is really unique and

99
00:04:01,242 --> 00:04:02,875
only happens once a year.

100
00:04:02,875 --> 00:04:05,908
Is there a festival that happens 10 times a year?

101
00:04:06,375 --> 00:04:08,042
Well, no, but...

102
00:04:08,042 --> 00:04:10,808
- Songkran is famous, right? / - Yes.

103
00:04:10,808 --> 00:04:14,242
Songkran is influenced by Thingyan.

104
00:04:14,242 --> 00:04:15,175
That's how it was created.

105
00:04:15,175 --> 00:04:17,042
- Thingyan is the original. / - Yes, it's the original.

106
00:04:17,042 --> 00:04:18,275
- Are you sure? / - It's the original?

107
00:04:18,275 --> 00:04:19,042
Yes, I'm sure.

108
00:04:19,042 --> 00:04:20,808
- Who said that? / - It was from a book.

109
00:04:20,808 --> 00:04:21,742
- It was from a book? / - It was in a book.

110
00:04:21,742 --> 00:04:23,375
I also read something from a book.

111
00:04:23,375 --> 00:04:24,742
It originated from Thingyan

112
00:04:24,742 --> 00:04:27,742
but Songkran is the most famous and the hottest.

113
00:04:29,675 --> 00:04:32,042
You can't say you've had blood sausage soup

114
00:04:32,042 --> 00:04:34,408
until you try it at the original restaurant.

115
00:04:34,408 --> 00:04:35,508
You don't have to eat

116
00:04:35,508 --> 00:04:36,908
Pyeongyang cold noodles in Pyeongyang.

117
00:04:40,442 --> 00:04:42,475
- Good job. / - Good job.

118
00:04:42,475 --> 00:04:45,408
- Good job. / - Good, good, good.

119
00:04:45,842 --> 00:04:48,575
We came here thinking that we already won.

120
00:04:50,142 --> 00:04:52,008
Thank you.

121
00:04:53,075 --> 00:04:55,142
I love this attitude.

122
00:04:55,142 --> 00:04:56,008
Wait a minute.

123
00:04:56,008 --> 00:04:57,908
It isn't the first time we're going to Myanmar...

124
00:04:57,908 --> 00:04:58,942
- On Battle Trip. / - That's right.

125
00:04:58,942 --> 00:04:59,308
That's right.

126
00:04:59,308 --> 00:05:00,608
We already went there once.

127
00:05:00,608 --> 00:05:03,842
- Kim Suyong and Park Hwisun went there. / - Yes.

128
00:05:03,842 --> 00:05:06,342
- We lost by a landslide, right? / - Yes.

129
00:05:06,975 --> 00:05:09,508
I only remember them sitting on the floor.

130
00:05:09,508 --> 00:05:12,842
They couldn't do much though they wanted to.

131
00:05:12,842 --> 00:05:15,842
But that time, they only went to Yangon.

132
00:05:15,842 --> 00:05:16,942
- Right. / - Yangon, Myanmar.

133
00:05:16,942 --> 00:05:19,175
- We went to Bagan. / - Where?

134
00:05:19,175 --> 00:05:20,508
Bagan.

135
00:05:20,508 --> 00:05:21,475
- Bagan. / - Bagan?

136
00:05:21,475 --> 00:05:23,875
Will you show a completely different Myanmar

137
00:05:23,875 --> 00:05:25,375
from the last visit?

138
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:27,275
It's going to be a different picture.

139
00:05:27,275 --> 00:05:29,042
People who travel a lot

140
00:05:29,042 --> 00:05:31,942
often say that you've never been to Myanmar

141
00:05:31,942 --> 00:05:33,108
if you haven't been to Bagan.

142
00:05:33,108 --> 00:05:34,608
We didn't go to Bagan last time.

143
00:05:34,608 --> 00:05:36,175
I think that's why you lost.

144
00:05:37,242 --> 00:05:39,842
Let's go to Bagan, Myanmar first today.

145
00:05:39,842 --> 00:05:41,608
- Okay. / - That's forcing the issue.

146
00:05:41,608 --> 00:05:44,608
I think both trips will be amazing.

147
00:05:44,608 --> 00:05:45,308
Okay.

148
00:05:45,308 --> 00:05:47,808
We have our 100 impartial judges with us today.

149
00:05:47,808 --> 00:05:49,408
Welcome.

150
00:05:51,308 --> 00:05:54,475
Today's match is a little different.

151
00:05:54,475 --> 00:05:56,908
Originally, we would watch the Myanmar trip and

152
00:05:56,908 --> 00:05:59,408
then watch the Thailand trip and end it in one round.

153
00:05:59,408 --> 00:06:01,142
But there's an extra round today.

154
00:06:01,142 --> 00:06:02,075
What is that?

155
00:06:02,075 --> 00:06:04,475
It's 2 plus 1 today.

156
00:06:05,842 --> 00:06:07,242
So much content.

157
00:06:07,242 --> 00:06:08,975
- It's simple. / - Quite amazing.

158
00:06:08,975 --> 00:06:10,975
Let's see who will win after 3 weeks.

159
00:06:10,975 --> 00:06:12,575
Please look forward to it.

160
00:06:12,575 --> 00:06:15,242
Let's see Myanmar on the map first.

161
00:06:15,242 --> 00:06:16,308
Where is Myanmar?

162
00:06:16,308 --> 00:06:20,042
Myanmar is close to Cambodia and Thailand.

163
00:06:20,042 --> 00:06:21,508
It's quite far.

164
00:06:21,508 --> 00:06:24,808
It takes 5 hours 40 minutes

165
00:06:24,808 --> 00:06:27,542
from Korea to Yangon.

166
00:06:27,542 --> 00:06:28,908
It takes 1 hour 20 minutes

167
00:06:28,908 --> 00:06:30,708
by plane from Yangon to Bagan.

168
00:06:30,708 --> 00:06:33,608
- That's quite far from Yangon. / - Yes.

169
00:06:33,608 --> 00:06:37,108
Then is the Thingyan festival in Yangon?

170
00:06:37,108 --> 00:06:38,375
Then is the Thingyan festival in Yangon?

171
00:06:38,375 --> 00:06:40,075
Yes, Thingyan festival happens

172
00:06:40,075 --> 00:06:42,108
throughout the whole of Myanmar.

173
00:06:42,108 --> 00:06:44,508
It's like Korea's Seollal.

174
00:06:44,508 --> 00:06:47,042
So we thought that it would be better to go to Yangon,

175
00:06:47,042 --> 00:06:49,575
since it's easy for tourists to go there.

176
00:06:49,575 --> 00:06:52,008
- So it happens all around Myanmar. / - Yes.

177
00:06:52,008 --> 00:06:54,408
- And you decided to go to Yangon. / - Yes.

178
00:06:55,108 --> 00:06:57,275
- Do you have a tour name? / - They have one.

179
00:06:57,275 --> 00:07:00,708
- We have a tour name. / - Show us.

180
00:07:00,708 --> 00:07:02,075
1, 2, 3.

181
00:07:02,075 --> 00:07:04,508
Firefighting Tour, bboom bboom!

182
00:07:06,808 --> 00:07:11,008
- Let's watch the Myanmar trip... / - So out of synch.

183
00:07:11,008 --> 00:07:11,875
They don't match at all.

184
00:07:11,875 --> 00:07:14,508
(The day they leave for Myanmar)

185
00:07:15,475 --> 00:07:17,608
(Ayoung arrived at the airport first)

186
00:07:17,608 --> 00:07:19,142
Is this it?

187
00:07:20,675 --> 00:07:22,208
I'm here.

188
00:07:22,975 --> 00:07:24,675
I'm here.

189
00:07:24,675 --> 00:07:26,108
- Hi. / - Hi.

190
00:07:26,108 --> 00:07:27,875
Are you a little less awkward with each other now?

191
00:07:27,875 --> 00:07:30,242
Don't ask whether we're awkward or not.

192
00:07:30,242 --> 00:07:32,142
That makes us awkward.

193
00:07:32,142 --> 00:07:34,175
We were okay.

194
00:07:34,175 --> 00:07:35,108
It's awkward if people ask that.

195
00:07:35,108 --> 00:07:36,575
- Hello. / - That's right.

196
00:07:38,442 --> 00:07:40,208
(Do I look good on camera?)

197
00:07:41,542 --> 00:07:45,575
I'm not going by myself.

198
00:07:45,575 --> 00:07:48,542
A lot of people around us said we would get along

199
00:07:48,542 --> 00:07:50,642
with each other really well.

200
00:07:50,642 --> 00:07:52,808
People around you are usually right.

201
00:07:56,375 --> 00:07:58,742
Ayoung looks like a teacher there.

202
00:07:58,742 --> 00:08:01,475
I had to go there after work...

203
00:08:01,475 --> 00:08:04,375
You're the same age as me, right?

204
00:08:04,375 --> 00:08:05,075
Are you the same age?

205
00:08:05,075 --> 00:08:06,575
- Yes. We're friends. / - That was so awkward.

206
00:08:06,575 --> 00:08:09,308
- I was born in 1986. / - You're the same age?

207
00:08:09,308 --> 00:08:11,842
This is a bit awkward. I was born in early 1987.

208
00:08:11,842 --> 00:08:12,508
It's messy.

209
00:08:12,508 --> 00:08:15,208
Let's just make it easy and be friends.

210
00:08:16,775 --> 00:08:17,575
Let's be friends.

211
00:08:17,575 --> 00:08:20,842
I'll slowly try to stop speaking formally to you.

212
00:08:21,608 --> 00:08:24,075
(Awkward)

213
00:08:25,975 --> 00:08:27,908
Is there a wall between them?

214
00:08:27,908 --> 00:08:28,742
They're adorable.

215
00:08:28,742 --> 00:08:30,075
My father was born in early 1939 and

216
00:08:30,075 --> 00:08:31,342
he doesn't befriend people born in 1938.

217
00:08:32,375 --> 00:08:34,875
It's true. He doesn't want to mess up the age rank.

218
00:08:35,442 --> 00:08:39,808
We're here to see your traveling preferences.

219
00:08:39,808 --> 00:08:40,742
If people get along well,

220
00:08:40,742 --> 00:08:42,608
they get really close after going on a trip together.

221
00:08:43,108 --> 00:08:45,775
Korean food or local food?

222
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:47,942
Choose what you like on a trip. 1, 2, 3.

223
00:08:47,942 --> 00:08:49,108
- Local food. / - Local food.

224
00:08:49,108 --> 00:08:51,308
Activities or rest? 1, 2, 3.

225
00:08:51,308 --> 00:08:52,475
- Activities. / - Activities.

226
00:08:53,075 --> 00:08:54,542
- They match. / - Rest or sight-seeing?

227
00:08:54,542 --> 00:08:55,408
1,2,3.

228
00:08:55,408 --> 00:08:56,675
- Sight-seeing. / - Sight-seeing.

229
00:08:57,708 --> 00:08:59,408
They're the exact opposite of us.

230
00:08:59,408 --> 00:09:02,808
I like to have a lot to do when I go there.

231
00:09:02,808 --> 00:09:05,042
I go to a lot of places.

232
00:09:05,042 --> 00:09:08,342
I think I'm the most diligent out of the year

233
00:09:08,342 --> 00:09:09,842
when I'm traveling.

234
00:09:09,842 --> 00:09:12,175
I usually don't like to rest

235
00:09:12,175 --> 00:09:16,042
and not do anything.

236
00:09:16,042 --> 00:09:18,242
There's a reason why they're slim.

237
00:09:19,142 --> 00:09:21,208
Suji, rest or sight-seeing? 1, 2, 3.

238
00:09:21,208 --> 00:09:22,075
Rest!

239
00:09:22,608 --> 00:09:24,442
There's a reason why people are slim.

240
00:09:25,042 --> 00:09:27,642
I like to go to historic sites.

241
00:09:27,642 --> 00:09:29,308
I also like to go to museums.

242
00:09:29,308 --> 00:09:31,342
I was so surprised.

243
00:09:31,342 --> 00:09:36,175
I hate going to historic sites the most...

244
00:09:38,475 --> 00:09:41,475
They're divided.

245
00:09:41,475 --> 00:09:44,342
- She hates it the most. / - That travel package feel...

246
00:09:44,342 --> 00:09:45,508
- She's trying to make up for it, right? / - Yes.

247
00:09:45,508 --> 00:09:47,842
I simply think that there's a place like that.

248
00:09:47,842 --> 00:09:50,942
I search for it and just pass by.

249
00:09:50,942 --> 00:09:54,042
That's it. Some people go on tours

250
00:09:54,042 --> 00:09:55,575
to only see that historic building.

251
00:09:55,575 --> 00:09:57,675
That's me.

252
00:09:59,842 --> 00:10:01,742
That can be meaningful, sure.

253
00:10:01,742 --> 00:10:04,042
It's not for me.

254
00:10:05,575 --> 00:10:07,175
They're awkward again.

255
00:10:07,175 --> 00:10:09,008
It's really interesting when people like her explain...

256
00:10:09,008 --> 00:10:10,742
- The historic sites for you. / - That's nice.

257
00:10:10,742 --> 00:10:13,442
People like Ayoung study about them before they go.

258
00:10:13,442 --> 00:10:15,775
- I buy a book. / - She buys a book before going.

259
00:10:15,775 --> 00:10:19,208
The theme is... International festival special.

260
00:10:19,208 --> 00:10:21,075
- Festival? / - I see.

261
00:10:21,075 --> 00:10:24,442
It must be the season for Southeast Asian countries

262
00:10:24,442 --> 00:10:26,575
to have festivals.

263
00:10:27,508 --> 00:10:30,142
I've heard about Songkran before.

264
00:10:30,142 --> 00:10:32,142
Songkran?

265
00:10:32,942 --> 00:10:33,908
It's the one we went.

266
00:10:33,908 --> 00:10:35,375
That's how they splash water.

267
00:10:38,408 --> 00:10:39,875
They look excited.

268
00:10:39,875 --> 00:10:41,308
That was nothing compared to what we did.

269
00:10:41,742 --> 00:10:44,708
(Researching)

270
00:10:45,508 --> 00:10:50,208
These water festivals originated

271
00:10:50,208 --> 00:10:51,342
from Myanmar.

272
00:10:51,342 --> 00:10:52,842
- Myanmar? / - Have you been there?

273
00:10:52,842 --> 00:10:54,308
No, I haven't.

274
00:10:54,308 --> 00:10:57,475
Let me think about what I've read about it.

275
00:10:57,475 --> 00:11:00,075
- She loves reading. / - It's a country of gold.

276
00:11:00,075 --> 00:11:02,042
She read many books before coming.

277
00:11:02,042 --> 00:11:03,275
She learns everything from books.

278
00:11:03,275 --> 00:11:04,942
- Was studying the easiest for you? / - No...

279
00:11:06,075 --> 00:11:09,875
I think it's an undiscovered country.

280
00:11:12,875 --> 00:11:16,142
I feel like Myanmar is an undiscovered country.

281
00:11:17,708 --> 00:11:19,408
That's the one.

282
00:11:19,408 --> 00:11:21,075
That was on Battle Trip before, right?

283
00:11:21,075 --> 00:11:24,175
- They washed with water there, right? / - Yes.

284
00:11:24,175 --> 00:11:25,075
That's pretty.

285
00:11:25,075 --> 00:11:27,008
It does look pretty on video.

286
00:11:28,675 --> 00:11:32,008
People say it's a pagoda we must see before we die.

287
00:11:32,008 --> 00:11:34,108
(Myanmar, the last gem of Asia)

288
00:11:34,642 --> 00:11:37,108
We have to name our tour.

289
00:11:37,108 --> 00:11:39,042
- Right. The name of our tour. / - What should we do?

290
00:11:39,575 --> 00:11:41,008
Water...

291
00:11:41,508 --> 00:11:42,775
Fire...

292
00:11:43,108 --> 00:11:44,975
Fire, water?

293
00:11:44,975 --> 00:11:47,075
Fire, water? Are we firefighters?

294
00:11:48,808 --> 00:11:50,842
I think Firefighting Tour is okay.

295
00:11:50,842 --> 00:11:52,642
Then let's go with Firefighting Tour.

296
00:11:52,642 --> 00:11:54,108
And one day, we'll do a fire day.

297
00:11:54,108 --> 00:11:55,942
And the other day, we'll do a water day.

298
00:11:55,942 --> 00:11:57,242
How about that?

299
00:11:57,242 --> 00:12:00,108
- I think Firefighting Tour is fitting. / - Let's go with that.

300
00:12:00,108 --> 00:12:02,075
You chose that because of water and fire?

301
00:12:02,075 --> 00:12:03,975
Bboom bboom.

302
00:12:03,975 --> 00:12:04,808
So pretty.

303
00:12:04,808 --> 00:12:06,542
I looked into this. I read in a book.

304
00:12:06,542 --> 00:12:07,675
They tried to disseminate it...

305
00:12:07,675 --> 00:12:09,608
She keeps saying she read about it.

306
00:12:09,608 --> 00:12:10,475
Is that a catchphrase?

307
00:12:13,508 --> 00:12:15,542
Ayoung begins her sentence with

308
00:12:15,542 --> 00:12:17,375
"I read in a book."

309
00:12:17,375 --> 00:12:19,475
The fire day begins at last.

310
00:12:19,475 --> 00:12:21,775
(Fire goddess prepares fire day in Bagan)

311
00:12:23,742 --> 00:12:25,175
That's a hot air balloon.

312
00:12:25,175 --> 00:12:27,542
- I'm really envious of that. / - That's on N's bucket list.

313
00:12:27,542 --> 00:12:28,675
That's beautiful.

314
00:12:28,675 --> 00:12:32,208
(A hot sunrise and a hot dish)

315
00:12:32,208 --> 00:12:33,575
This is the highlight.

316
00:12:33,942 --> 00:12:34,975
It looks so hot.

317
00:12:34,975 --> 00:12:36,975
It's burning up.

318
00:12:36,975 --> 00:12:38,675
I summon the water goddess.

319
00:12:38,675 --> 00:12:41,342
I see the seaweed on her head.

320
00:12:41,808 --> 00:12:43,908
Nose, mouth.

321
00:12:44,408 --> 00:12:45,642
I'm Hasandra.

322
00:12:46,608 --> 00:12:49,408
- Eat some ants. / - Out of the blue?

323
00:12:49,408 --> 00:12:52,575
Oh, no. I seriously don't remember saying that.

324
00:12:52,575 --> 00:12:55,875
I don't remember.

325
00:12:56,542 --> 00:12:58,575
Whether it was a dream or not.

326
00:12:58,575 --> 00:13:00,342
You could be shocked.

327
00:13:00,875 --> 00:13:04,175
(Water goddess, Sojin)

328
00:13:04,175 --> 00:13:06,108
Today is my day.

329
00:13:06,108 --> 00:13:08,142
Sojin's day, it's water day.

330
00:13:09,008 --> 00:13:11,942
So refreshing.

331
00:13:13,008 --> 00:13:15,575
(The highlight of water day)

332
00:13:15,575 --> 00:13:17,175
That looks fun.

333
00:13:17,642 --> 00:13:19,908
- That's how they spray it. / - It's no water gun.

334
00:13:23,275 --> 00:13:24,842
Round 1.

335
00:13:26,142 --> 00:13:27,275
What is this?

336
00:13:28,708 --> 00:13:30,408
I bet you read that in a book.

337
00:13:33,075 --> 00:13:35,308
- They're so good. / - Sojin.

338
00:13:35,308 --> 00:13:36,575
Sojin!

339
00:13:36,575 --> 00:13:37,642
That's amazing.

340
00:13:37,642 --> 00:13:40,475
That's amazing. I never expected so much action.

341
00:13:42,375 --> 00:13:44,908
(Korea to Myanmar)

342
00:13:44,908 --> 00:13:46,442
After you arrive in Yangon,

343
00:13:46,442 --> 00:13:49,775
you have to take a domestic flight to get to Bagan.

344
00:13:51,208 --> 00:13:53,675
(Capital of Pagan Kingdom of Bamar people)

345
00:13:53,675 --> 00:13:55,908
Look at the hot air balloons.

346
00:13:55,908 --> 00:13:58,175
That's something you see in paintings.

347
00:14:01,042 --> 00:14:02,875
It still looks beautiful.

348
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:04,842
It's so beautiful.

349
00:14:05,308 --> 00:14:06,442
Bagan.

350
00:14:08,908 --> 00:14:10,108
Bagan!

351
00:14:11,242 --> 00:14:12,742
We have to do it ourselves?

352
00:14:12,742 --> 00:14:14,875
We have to take it out from the plane ourselves?

353
00:14:17,108 --> 00:14:18,475
No...

354
00:14:18,475 --> 00:14:19,808
Oh, there are people...

355
00:14:19,808 --> 00:14:21,342
Wow, that's fascinating.

356
00:14:21,342 --> 00:14:22,708
There's no conveyor belt.

357
00:14:22,708 --> 00:14:25,142
The employees take out your bags for you.

358
00:14:25,142 --> 00:14:27,708
Then when your luggage comes out, you just take it.

359
00:14:29,808 --> 00:14:30,975
- I think that's faster. / - Once you see yours...

360
00:14:30,975 --> 00:14:33,175
-  Once you see yours, you have to take it. / - Yes.

361
00:14:34,042 --> 00:14:37,675
(Ayoung successfully snatches away her luggage)

362
00:14:37,842 --> 00:14:39,842
(That's mine)

363
00:14:41,908 --> 00:14:43,042
Thank you.

364
00:14:43,508 --> 00:14:45,608
Where do we need to go first?

365
00:14:45,608 --> 00:14:47,575
We actually have to buy something first.

366
00:14:47,575 --> 00:14:49,008
We must buy a ticket.

367
00:14:49,008 --> 00:14:50,408
- A ticket? / - Yes.

368
00:14:50,408 --> 00:14:52,175
This ticket allows us to get into

369
00:14:52,175 --> 00:14:55,142
every historical site in this city.

370
00:14:55,142 --> 00:14:56,808
25,000 kyats?

371
00:14:56,808 --> 00:15:00,442
This ticket is valid for 5 days!

372
00:15:01,508 --> 00:15:04,442
We need to go to Mani Sithu Market?

373
00:15:04,442 --> 00:15:07,775
- Yes, 5,000 kyats. / - 5,000 kyats?

374
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:10,542
So you just tell them the destination and get on?

375
00:15:10,542 --> 00:15:12,608
- That's $5. $4 something. / - It's fixed prices there.

376
00:15:13,308 --> 00:15:16,308
Taxis here only have fixed rates, so there's no meter.

377
00:15:16,308 --> 00:15:18,542
You have to agree on a price first.

378
00:15:18,542 --> 00:15:20,642
- They have no meter. / - Right.

379
00:15:21,375 --> 00:15:25,908
(10 minutes to Mani Sithu Market from the airport)

380
00:15:26,608 --> 00:15:29,075
This is Mani Sithu Market.

381
00:15:30,042 --> 00:15:32,242
There's a lot to see even from the entrance.

382
00:15:34,042 --> 00:15:36,142
My gosh, there must be a lot of stuff you can buy.

383
00:15:36,142 --> 00:15:37,808
Sook, you shouldn't go there.

384
00:15:37,808 --> 00:15:39,875
I'm a big spender, I have to buy everything there.

385
00:15:41,042 --> 00:15:42,908
I spend a day at a market like that.

386
00:15:43,708 --> 00:15:46,208
She spends all her paychecks there.

387
00:15:47,508 --> 00:15:50,208
- That looks like our traditional market. / - Yes.

388
00:15:51,575 --> 00:15:53,475
Myanmar old coins?

389
00:15:53,475 --> 00:15:55,542
They don't use coins now.

390
00:15:55,542 --> 00:15:57,775
- They have hexagon coins? / - They only use bills now.

391
00:15:57,775 --> 00:15:59,042
- The coins are so unique. / - Those are old coins.

392
00:15:59,042 --> 00:16:00,742
They sell coins there.

393
00:16:00,742 --> 00:16:03,208
- People buy those for souvenirs. / - Exactly.

394
00:16:03,208 --> 00:16:05,375
- I thought only Korea sold coins. / - So you remember.

395
00:16:05,975 --> 00:16:08,942
We must buy longyi here. Longyi.

396
00:16:08,942 --> 00:16:10,575
- Longyi? / - Yes.

397
00:16:10,575 --> 00:16:12,242
What was that again?

398
00:16:12,242 --> 00:16:15,942
Longyi is like the traditional clothing here.

399
00:16:16,442 --> 00:16:19,642
We have to wear that to enter the temples.

400
00:16:20,408 --> 00:16:23,675
- We can't show bare legs or shoulders. / - Right.

401
00:16:23,675 --> 00:16:25,575
To enter the temple...

402
00:16:25,575 --> 00:16:27,575
- Then what about... / - Longyi is like pants...

403
00:16:27,575 --> 00:16:30,042
What about those people who dress like monks

404
00:16:30,042 --> 00:16:31,142
and show their shoulders?

405
00:16:33,175 --> 00:16:34,875
That's a monk?

406
00:16:34,875 --> 00:16:37,242
So it's okay for monks? I'm curious now.

407
00:16:37,242 --> 00:16:38,042
That's so cute. How cute.

408
00:16:38,042 --> 00:16:39,975
It's her stream of consciousness.

409
00:16:41,108 --> 00:16:43,408
Look how big the pants are.

410
00:16:46,442 --> 00:16:48,342
That is longyi.

411
00:16:48,342 --> 00:16:49,742
I love longyi.

412
00:16:49,742 --> 00:16:51,208
You'd stay cool in those.

413
00:16:51,208 --> 00:16:53,708
- You must wear them to buffets. / - Absolutely.

414
00:16:55,175 --> 00:16:56,642
Pretty, pretty.

415
00:16:57,208 --> 00:16:58,908
A longyi...

416
00:16:58,908 --> 00:17:00,075
Who's that?

417
00:17:00,075 --> 00:17:01,575
That's Suyong.

418
00:17:01,575 --> 00:17:02,742
Oh, the previous episode.

419
00:17:03,475 --> 00:17:06,642
- That's Suyong... / - You wrap it and tie it, right?

420
00:17:09,208 --> 00:17:11,042
It never falls down.

421
00:17:11,842 --> 00:17:14,208
- That one has a string. / - That's got a string.

422
00:17:14,208 --> 00:17:16,308
There are ones like modernized hanbok

423
00:17:16,308 --> 00:17:19,008
with rubber bands and shaped like pants.

424
00:17:20,442 --> 00:17:22,242
Red one.

425
00:17:24,808 --> 00:17:26,142
Which one's prettier?

426
00:17:27,975 --> 00:17:29,508
I like this one.

427
00:17:30,975 --> 00:17:32,242
- Is this prettier? / - The color...

428
00:17:32,242 --> 00:17:35,042
I think Sojin wants the red one.

429
00:17:35,042 --> 00:17:36,642
Her mind's already made up.

430
00:17:36,642 --> 00:17:38,242
I want to wear an embroidered one

431
00:17:38,242 --> 00:17:39,808
since I'm in Southeast Asia.

432
00:17:40,175 --> 00:17:42,008
Why did she ask then?

433
00:17:42,975 --> 00:17:44,875
Why did you ask in the first place?

434
00:17:45,808 --> 00:17:47,208
I'm sorry.

435
00:17:47,842 --> 00:17:50,675
I'll take this one. Oops, I spoke informally.

436
00:17:51,775 --> 00:17:53,442
I'm sorry. No.

437
00:17:54,308 --> 00:17:55,842
So funny.

438
00:17:55,842 --> 00:17:57,742
She looks good in it.

439
00:17:57,742 --> 00:17:59,042
Just putting that on makes you

440
00:17:59,042 --> 00:18:00,542
really feel like you're on a trip.

441
00:18:00,542 --> 00:18:03,875
- Each one costs $3. / - Yes. So cheap.

442
00:18:04,708 --> 00:18:07,575
- We're going to ride an e-bike next. / - Really?

443
00:18:07,575 --> 00:18:09,975
- Will that be okay with you? / - I love it.

444
00:18:10,975 --> 00:18:12,408
- Will this continue? / - I guess so.

445
00:18:15,342 --> 00:18:17,775
Sojin, Sojin!

446
00:18:17,775 --> 00:18:20,275
- Sojin tries so hard. / - Sojin used up all her energy.

447
00:18:20,275 --> 00:18:23,708
(E-bike)

448
00:18:23,708 --> 00:18:26,675
A lot of people are riding bikes, right?

449
00:18:26,675 --> 00:18:29,242
Everyone travels on bikes.

450
00:18:29,242 --> 00:18:31,575
Luckily, the one we'll ride

451
00:18:31,575 --> 00:18:32,908
doesn't require a license.

452
00:18:32,908 --> 00:18:35,242
- Really? Is that it? / - We'll get around with this.

453
00:18:35,242 --> 00:18:37,242
Ta-da. Aren't they pretty?

454
00:18:37,242 --> 00:18:38,975
- That's a scooter. / - It doesn't look like an e-bike.

455
00:18:38,975 --> 00:18:39,975
Right?

456
00:18:39,975 --> 00:18:44,042
If you look, it's vast like a meadow.

457
00:18:44,542 --> 00:18:47,808
There's this thing called an e-bike.

458
00:18:47,808 --> 00:18:50,142
I guess it's an electric bicycle.

459
00:18:50,142 --> 00:18:51,742
An electric bike?

460
00:18:51,742 --> 00:18:52,742
Do you want to each get one?

461
00:18:52,742 --> 00:18:54,842
I love riding scooters.

462
00:18:54,842 --> 00:18:58,042
(Sojin enjoys riding scooters)

463
00:18:58,042 --> 00:18:59,975
I've never ridden a scooter.

464
00:18:59,975 --> 00:19:02,808
But I'm sure this one is easier

465
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:03,642
than a regular scooter.

466
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:05,542
It's too big for us to get around on foot.

467
00:19:05,542 --> 00:19:07,508
We can go to places by bike.

468
00:19:07,508 --> 00:19:08,775
We can stop at anywhere we like...

469
00:19:08,775 --> 00:19:10,475
- Take photos, and look around. / - That's scary.

470
00:19:10,475 --> 00:19:11,408
Look at her face.

471
00:19:11,808 --> 00:19:14,142
Read books about bikes now.

472
00:19:15,142 --> 00:19:17,008
(Pull handle to accelerate)

473
00:19:17,708 --> 00:19:21,308
When you pull the handle like this, it'll go forward.

474
00:19:21,308 --> 00:19:24,408
Just like this? Like this? Okay, okay.

475
00:19:25,008 --> 00:19:26,675
- I think I'll be okay. / - Okay.

476
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:31,142
Ayoung failed the driving test 6 times.

477
00:19:31,142 --> 00:19:32,642
The practical driving test.

478
00:19:32,642 --> 00:19:34,675
Did you not read books on driver tests?

479
00:19:34,675 --> 00:19:37,508
- I got 100% for the written test. / - She's all theory.

480
00:19:37,508 --> 00:19:39,542
She got a perfect score on the written test.

481
00:19:39,542 --> 00:19:41,975
I've never seen anyone do that.

482
00:19:41,975 --> 00:19:44,375
(She's filled with worry)

483
00:19:48,208 --> 00:19:50,475
(Why did I suggest riding this?)

484
00:19:51,742 --> 00:19:54,208
(Sojin leaves as if nothing worries her)

485
00:19:54,208 --> 00:19:56,275
- Hey, wait up! / - Can you catch up?

486
00:19:56,275 --> 00:19:57,142
You can't?

487
00:20:00,942 --> 00:20:03,442
- I'm worried. / - Indeed. I'm worried too.

488
00:20:04,175 --> 00:20:06,308
Ayoung, you have two left feet?

489
00:20:06,308 --> 00:20:09,342
A little. I'm just a little lacking.

490
00:20:10,308 --> 00:20:11,708
This is so much fun.

491
00:20:13,975 --> 00:20:16,042
Ayoung, are you okay back there?

492
00:20:18,308 --> 00:20:19,642
You're following me, right?

493
00:20:20,075 --> 00:20:22,408
(She's in a war with herself)

494
00:20:22,408 --> 00:20:24,942
That doesn't look too fast...

495
00:20:25,442 --> 00:20:26,708
Mommy! Why?

496
00:20:26,708 --> 00:20:29,208
That was about 15km per hour.

497
00:20:32,775 --> 00:20:34,142
I'm so worried.

498
00:20:35,775 --> 00:20:36,975
You could get badly injured.

499
00:20:36,975 --> 00:20:38,108
No, no.

500
00:20:38,108 --> 00:20:41,442
The ground is sandy...

501
00:20:41,442 --> 00:20:42,575
It could be hard.

502
00:20:42,575 --> 00:20:45,175
Ayoung is gone! Ayoung is gone!

503
00:20:45,175 --> 00:20:46,742
Oh, no. Wait a minute.

504
00:20:48,275 --> 00:20:49,908
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

505
00:20:50,608 --> 00:20:52,108
Wait a minute.

506
00:20:52,108 --> 00:20:54,308
Seriously...

507
00:20:54,308 --> 00:20:57,375
I might die before we get there.

508
00:20:59,342 --> 00:21:02,075
I actually can't control the bike.

509
00:21:02,975 --> 00:21:04,475
No, I think I can do it.

510
00:21:06,475 --> 00:21:09,508
(They head out again to the restaurant)

511
00:21:14,175 --> 00:21:16,675
(They come to the fork in the road)

512
00:21:16,675 --> 00:21:19,442
(This is how very nervous fire goddess turns left)

513
00:21:20,708 --> 00:21:23,475
I have to turn left. I can't use the turn signals.

514
00:21:25,608 --> 00:21:26,608
Oh, no.

515
00:21:27,208 --> 00:21:29,242
I'll turn left.

516
00:21:31,342 --> 00:21:32,575
Argh.

517
00:21:33,908 --> 00:21:36,275
Sorry! Sorry.

518
00:21:37,575 --> 00:21:39,308
(It's okay)

519
00:21:40,108 --> 00:21:41,808
I'm going to turn right.

520
00:21:41,808 --> 00:21:44,142
I'm turning right. Right.

521
00:21:45,142 --> 00:21:47,808
- Turning right. / - Excuse me but who are you talking to?

522
00:21:47,808 --> 00:21:50,108
I couldn't use the turn signals.

523
00:21:50,108 --> 00:21:51,842
She sounds like a GPS.

524
00:21:51,842 --> 00:21:55,642
(Charcoal)

525
00:21:56,608 --> 00:21:59,075
(The fire day will be heated with)

526
00:21:59,075 --> 00:22:02,375
(A fantastic combination of vegetables and meat)

527
00:22:03,508 --> 00:22:05,242
That's so pretty.

528
00:22:06,275 --> 00:22:07,375
It looks delicious.

529
00:22:07,375 --> 00:22:09,608
First time I've heard someone say that meat is pretty.

530
00:22:09,608 --> 00:22:11,775
The arrangement of the colors is so beautiful.

531
00:22:16,875 --> 00:22:17,575
It is beautiful.

532
00:22:17,575 --> 00:22:19,442
Even the sound is pretty.

533
00:22:21,408 --> 00:22:23,308
So this is charcoal.

534
00:22:24,542 --> 00:22:26,008
Can we eat it just like this?

535
00:22:26,008 --> 00:22:28,375
Pineapples.

536
00:22:28,375 --> 00:22:31,475
- Asparagus. / - Carrots.

537
00:22:31,475 --> 00:22:33,442
- Chicken. / - Broccoli.

538
00:22:36,242 --> 00:22:38,675
(Let's see, where's the sauce?)

539
00:22:44,275 --> 00:22:46,108
This is peanut sauce.

540
00:22:47,308 --> 00:22:49,575
- This is fish sauce. / - That sauce looks delicious.

541
00:22:49,575 --> 00:22:50,442
It was so delicious.

542
00:22:50,442 --> 00:22:51,608
- Right? / - Yes!

543
00:22:51,608 --> 00:22:54,075
It looks deliciously mixed.

544
00:22:54,075 --> 00:22:55,408
(My style)

545
00:22:55,408 --> 00:22:56,608
It's quite spicy.

546
00:22:57,508 --> 00:22:59,042
Are they steamed?

547
00:22:59,042 --> 00:23:01,775
- They're grilled. Like on a brazier. / - Grilled?

548
00:23:01,775 --> 00:23:04,842
They steam it first then grill it on there.

549
00:23:04,842 --> 00:23:06,475
It tastes different.

550
00:23:07,442 --> 00:23:09,608
(Sniffing)

551
00:23:12,708 --> 00:23:13,408
Try it.

552
00:23:13,408 --> 00:23:16,408
Soy sauce, soy sauce...

553
00:23:17,175 --> 00:23:19,642
It smells like soy sauce braised chicken.

554
00:23:19,642 --> 00:23:22,042
It was so difficult to explain how it tasted.

555
00:23:22,042 --> 00:23:23,542
Altogether.

556
00:23:23,542 --> 00:23:25,008
The meat looks delicious.

557
00:23:26,808 --> 00:23:27,775
Chicken?

558
00:23:30,508 --> 00:23:33,342
Although it's grilled, it's moist.

559
00:23:34,308 --> 00:23:35,808
It's so delicious.

560
00:23:35,808 --> 00:23:37,942
It tastes similar to chicken skewers, doesn't it?

561
00:23:40,675 --> 00:23:43,408
(What about grilled vegetables and fruits?)

562
00:23:43,408 --> 00:23:46,675
Grilled fruits and vegetables won't make you fat.

563
00:23:46,675 --> 00:23:48,042
Because it's grilled.

564
00:23:50,608 --> 00:23:53,475
- Grilled pineapples are really delicious. / - They were.

565
00:23:53,475 --> 00:23:54,942
That looks good.

566
00:23:54,942 --> 00:23:57,808
I want to carry peanut sauce around.

567
00:23:57,808 --> 00:24:00,308
Everything is delicious when it's dipped in it.

568
00:24:00,308 --> 00:24:03,242
The vegetables and fruits are delicious with the sauce.

569
00:24:03,242 --> 00:24:05,742
I'll dip this in

570
00:24:05,742 --> 00:24:08,908
garlic chili fish sauce which is my favorite.

571
00:24:08,908 --> 00:24:10,908
That sauce was really delicious.

572
00:24:13,508 --> 00:24:15,208
(It's delicious)

573
00:24:17,875 --> 00:24:20,208
(She eats 3 ingredients in a row)

574
00:24:20,208 --> 00:24:21,575
- Chicken? / - Yeah.

575
00:24:21,575 --> 00:24:23,408
Is it okay to eat it all at once?

576
00:24:23,908 --> 00:24:25,975
It's sour, salty and sweet.

577
00:24:26,675 --> 00:24:29,342
It's somehow addictive, isn't it?

578
00:24:29,342 --> 00:24:30,108
It's somehow addictive, isn't it?

579
00:24:30,108 --> 00:24:31,942
This sauce is so delicious.

580
00:24:31,942 --> 00:24:34,475
I think you eat it for this taste.

581
00:24:36,375 --> 00:24:38,042
What is this?

582
00:24:38,042 --> 00:24:39,642
- It's cilantro. / - Isn't it cilantro?

583
00:24:41,575 --> 00:24:43,208
Isn't it cilantro?

584
00:24:44,742 --> 00:24:47,175
(She's curious, therefore she tries it)

585
00:24:47,175 --> 00:24:48,408
Isn't it cilantro?

586
00:24:48,408 --> 00:24:50,242
You said you like it?

587
00:24:50,242 --> 00:24:52,442
I normally really like cilantro...

588
00:24:52,442 --> 00:24:54,675
This reminds of something I ate in the playground.

589
00:24:55,008 --> 00:24:57,275
- You ate it at a playground? / - You ate grass?

590
00:24:57,275 --> 00:24:57,875
Yes.

591
00:24:57,875 --> 00:25:00,042
- Oh, it's parsley. / - It's parsley.

592
00:25:00,042 --> 00:25:03,308
I munched the whole piece and it shocked me.

593
00:25:04,342 --> 00:25:06,908
Today is the first day I met you.

594
00:25:06,908 --> 00:25:08,042
Parsley.

595
00:25:09,175 --> 00:25:12,042
I normally like spices but that was too strong.

596
00:25:12,542 --> 00:25:15,175
After this, we're going somewhere.

597
00:25:15,175 --> 00:25:18,175
There are thousands of temples in Bagan.

598
00:25:18,842 --> 00:25:21,408
And we'll visit the most beautiful one.

599
00:25:23,842 --> 00:25:25,408
No dessert?

600
00:25:27,208 --> 00:25:28,875
That's bad.

601
00:25:28,875 --> 00:25:30,408
You must be shocked.

602
00:25:31,875 --> 00:25:34,242
- Suji's shocked right now. / - Let's just keep watching.

603
00:25:34,975 --> 00:25:36,908
It must be satisfying to ride there.

604
00:25:36,908 --> 00:25:40,008
Driving and looking around like that makes you feel...

605
00:25:40,008 --> 00:25:41,642
It was really nice.

606
00:25:41,642 --> 00:25:43,542
It's so pretty, isn't it?

607
00:25:43,542 --> 00:25:46,442
There are so many things near us and far away.

608
00:25:47,775 --> 00:25:50,242
Oh, my God. It's like an unknown world.

609
00:25:50,242 --> 00:25:53,242
I can't look around right now.

610
00:25:53,742 --> 00:25:55,675
She looks more comfortable than earlier though.

611
00:25:55,675 --> 00:25:58,242
I want to turn my head and look around too.

612
00:25:58,242 --> 00:25:59,975
I bet it'd be beautiful.

613
00:25:59,975 --> 00:26:02,108
Ayoung, where is our destination?

614
00:26:02,108 --> 00:26:03,908
We have a little more to go.

615
00:26:07,475 --> 00:26:09,042
It looks very fancy.

616
00:26:09,042 --> 00:26:10,575
It's beautiful, isn't it?

617
00:26:10,575 --> 00:26:12,375
- It's Ananda Temple. / - What is this?

618
00:26:14,342 --> 00:26:16,575
- It looks somewhat European. / - It does.

619
00:26:16,908 --> 00:26:18,075
- You're right. / - Right?

620
00:26:18,075 --> 00:26:19,408
It looks European.

621
00:26:19,408 --> 00:26:21,275
(It's 1 of the 1,001 buildings you must see)

622
00:26:22,342 --> 00:26:26,408
(Cave structure makes it look solemn and mysterious)

623
00:26:28,675 --> 00:26:33,108
(Sunshine through the lattice windows creates beauty)

624
00:26:33,108 --> 00:26:34,475
When you enter the temple,

625
00:26:34,475 --> 00:26:37,542
you need to take off your shoes and socks.

626
00:26:38,075 --> 00:26:40,542
You need to dress respectfully too.

627
00:26:40,542 --> 00:26:41,575
In the early days,

628
00:26:41,575 --> 00:26:44,175
there were different zones for prayer.

629
00:26:44,775 --> 00:26:45,908
Because of the caste system.

630
00:26:45,908 --> 00:26:48,575
The third room was for common people.

631
00:26:50,808 --> 00:26:53,275
The second room for nobles and monks.

632
00:26:54,175 --> 00:26:57,608
The first room was for the king.

633
00:27:02,842 --> 00:27:05,175
(Even monks take pictures of this sacred place)

634
00:27:05,175 --> 00:27:07,375
There's a Buddha statue on every side.

635
00:27:07,375 --> 00:27:09,242
North, south, east, west. There are 4 of them.

636
00:27:16,242 --> 00:27:19,808
One of the statues looks very solemn

637
00:27:19,808 --> 00:27:21,475
from where the king prays.

638
00:27:21,475 --> 00:27:24,942
It almost looks angry.

639
00:27:24,942 --> 00:27:26,175
It's telling the king to do a good job.

640
00:27:26,175 --> 00:27:29,808
If you look from the commoners view...

641
00:27:29,808 --> 00:27:32,608
- It looks kind with a look of deep meaning. / - I see.

642
00:27:32,608 --> 00:27:34,675
It's fun to go to historic site with people like her.

643
00:27:34,675 --> 00:27:35,742
Of course.

644
00:27:35,742 --> 00:27:37,342
If you don't know the story, you don't fully appreciate.

645
00:27:37,342 --> 00:27:38,542
- It's no fun. / - Right.

646
00:27:38,542 --> 00:27:40,542
(He looks strict, serious and solemn)

647
00:27:40,542 --> 00:27:42,508
Does he look solemn and angry?

648
00:27:42,508 --> 00:27:43,708
No.

649
00:27:43,708 --> 00:27:45,708
- He's like this. / - Let's go back and check again.

650
00:27:45,708 --> 00:27:46,808
I'm confused.

651
00:27:49,942 --> 00:27:51,942
No way!

652
00:27:51,942 --> 00:27:53,675
- Doesn't he look like he's smiling? / - I spat.

653
00:27:53,675 --> 00:27:55,208
- Right? / - Yeah.

654
00:27:55,208 --> 00:27:57,342
That's unbelievable.

655
00:27:57,342 --> 00:27:58,808
(He looks merciful and is smiling)

656
00:27:59,242 --> 00:28:01,408
His eyes look different.

657
00:28:02,208 --> 00:28:03,875
You're right.

658
00:28:03,875 --> 00:28:06,942
- Isn't it fascinating? / - You're right.

659
00:28:06,942 --> 00:28:09,075
- Isn't it different? / - You're right.

660
00:28:09,075 --> 00:28:10,775
It looks like a different statue.

661
00:28:10,775 --> 00:28:13,408
It's like folding bills as a kid.

662
00:28:14,608 --> 00:28:17,208
And you look from above and below.

663
00:28:17,208 --> 00:28:18,508
You're right.

664
00:28:18,508 --> 00:28:20,742
- That's fascinating. / - That's so fascinating.

665
00:28:20,742 --> 00:28:24,408
It's like he's saying he'll protect us.

666
00:28:24,408 --> 00:28:27,642
- I'm watching you. / - Do a good job.

667
00:28:27,642 --> 00:28:29,908
- That's what it is. / - Do it right.

668
00:28:29,908 --> 00:28:30,908
That's the expression he's making.

669
00:28:30,908 --> 00:28:32,575
- You're right. / - Fascinating.

670
00:28:33,775 --> 00:28:36,808
- This place... / - So pretty!

671
00:28:37,308 --> 00:28:39,142
- It looks like a monastery, right? / - Yes.

672
00:28:39,708 --> 00:28:41,108
Can you take pictures inside the temple?

673
00:28:41,108 --> 00:28:42,575
- Yes, you can. / - Oh, you can?

674
00:28:43,208 --> 00:28:45,542
(The hot sunshine of Bagan is the lighting of nature)

675
00:28:46,442 --> 00:28:49,275
Ayoung, pretend you're a noble. I'll take a picture.

676
00:28:49,275 --> 00:28:50,342
This is the good thing...

677
00:28:50,342 --> 00:28:52,608
- About traveling with girls. / - I'll try.

678
00:28:56,608 --> 00:28:58,608
(Wait a minute)

679
00:28:58,608 --> 00:28:59,575
Excuse me.

680
00:28:59,575 --> 00:29:01,742
- This is the king's zone. / - Yes.

681
00:29:01,742 --> 00:29:03,975
The noble should take a photo of the king first.

682
00:29:03,975 --> 00:29:05,842
Does it have to be that way?

683
00:29:06,942 --> 00:29:09,975
I'm just kidding.

684
00:29:09,975 --> 00:29:12,108
Men never do that.

685
00:29:12,108 --> 00:29:13,408
Think about it. When a man says,

686
00:29:13,408 --> 00:29:15,908
"Hey, you should take a picture of me first."

687
00:29:15,908 --> 00:29:17,075
"Sorry."

688
00:29:17,675 --> 00:29:19,308
We never do that.

689
00:29:20,975 --> 00:29:24,542
(She tries to take her best shots)

690
00:29:26,742 --> 00:29:27,708
It's backlit.

691
00:29:27,708 --> 00:29:28,842
What is this?

692
00:29:28,842 --> 00:29:31,442
- It's backlit. / - That's a shame.

693
00:29:32,542 --> 00:29:35,708
(Ayoung, the noble, goes to meet Sojin, the royal)

694
00:29:37,042 --> 00:29:39,075
(Well?)

695
00:29:40,042 --> 00:29:41,308
Where are we?

696
00:29:41,308 --> 00:29:42,942
- Oh, no. / - She's lost in there?

697
00:29:42,942 --> 00:29:44,208
She's not only a bad driver,

698
00:29:44,208 --> 00:29:45,242
she's directionally challenged too.

699
00:29:45,242 --> 00:29:46,408
- Are you? / - Yes, I am.

700
00:29:46,408 --> 00:29:49,242
- All she does is read books. / - Directional dyslexia.

701
00:29:49,242 --> 00:29:51,108
I'm really lost.

702
00:29:51,108 --> 00:29:51,975
Hang on a second.

703
00:29:53,942 --> 00:29:55,608
Hey, there you are.

704
00:29:56,208 --> 00:29:58,408
How do I get over there?

705
00:29:59,075 --> 00:30:01,575
You can never reach me.

706
00:30:02,242 --> 00:30:05,908
You're already... Not anybody can be a king.

707
00:30:06,575 --> 00:30:10,908
Wait there. I will... I will...

708
00:30:11,508 --> 00:30:13,608
What's the word? Anyway, I'll go to you.

709
00:30:15,875 --> 00:30:18,242
I saw the statue over there.

710
00:30:18,242 --> 00:30:20,008
But the statue is here.

711
00:30:20,008 --> 00:30:22,342
- This is the way. / - What? How did you get here?

712
00:30:23,308 --> 00:30:26,042
We looked at this statue...

713
00:30:26,875 --> 00:30:29,675
And then walked over there and met there, right?

714
00:30:30,375 --> 00:30:31,908
Is this the statue we saw?

715
00:30:32,875 --> 00:30:34,708
Hey, can you stand here for a second?

716
00:30:34,708 --> 00:30:37,208
- I need to check this. / - Okay.

717
00:30:37,875 --> 00:30:40,808
Clearly, Ayoung is the one that's confused.

718
00:30:40,808 --> 00:30:43,075
- I'm still confused. / - You're going again?

719
00:30:43,075 --> 00:30:45,475
You were supposed to be there.

720
00:30:45,475 --> 00:30:47,108
Hold on. Stop lying.

721
00:30:47,108 --> 00:30:49,242
Ayoung, look at the face of Buddha.

722
00:30:51,208 --> 00:30:53,408
- It does look exactly the same. / - Right?

723
00:30:57,942 --> 00:30:59,075
(Surprise!)

724
00:30:59,075 --> 00:31:00,542
She almost hit me.

725
00:31:01,008 --> 00:31:03,308
That was a very natural hand movement.

726
00:31:04,742 --> 00:31:05,542
You...

727
00:31:06,042 --> 00:31:07,108
You need to self-reflect.

728
00:31:07,108 --> 00:31:09,042
- Just watch it on the broadcast. / - No...

729
00:31:09,042 --> 00:31:10,342
I'm serious.

730
00:31:11,108 --> 00:31:13,508
(What is this mystery of Ananda Temple?)

731
00:31:13,842 --> 00:31:15,408
Hey, can you stand here for a second?

732
00:31:15,408 --> 00:31:17,842
- I need to check this. / - Okay.

733
00:31:17,842 --> 00:31:19,275
(When Ayoung went to check the directions)

734
00:31:19,975 --> 00:31:21,808
(Glancing)

735
00:31:23,542 --> 00:31:25,808
(She runs at full speed)

736
00:31:27,008 --> 00:31:28,842
I'll stand exactly as I did before.

737
00:31:29,608 --> 00:31:32,642
- Sojin tricked her. / - I see.

738
00:31:33,275 --> 00:31:36,508
- See? / - You were supposed to be there.

739
00:31:36,508 --> 00:31:38,908
Hold on. Stop lying.

740
00:31:38,908 --> 00:31:40,708
Ayoung, look at the face of Buddha.

741
00:31:41,242 --> 00:31:43,308
(Forget the face, I need to check this)

742
00:31:44,775 --> 00:31:48,408
Sojin fooled her good.

743
00:31:52,375 --> 00:31:54,608
- You were here the whole time, right? / - I was here.

744
00:31:54,608 --> 00:31:55,908
- You were here, right? / - Yeah.

745
00:31:55,908 --> 00:31:58,508
Look at the Buddha's face.

746
00:31:58,508 --> 00:32:00,475
We were standing here before.

747
00:32:01,275 --> 00:32:02,842
I'm so confused right now.

748
00:32:02,842 --> 00:32:04,642
So which way do we have to exit?

749
00:32:06,175 --> 00:32:07,975
Are you asking me that?

750
00:32:10,975 --> 00:32:11,575
Hello,

751
00:32:11,575 --> 00:32:13,075
this is Sojin GPS.

752
00:32:13,075 --> 00:32:15,908
Please drive safely as always.

753
00:32:18,242 --> 00:32:20,042
Yes, this is what I saw.

754
00:32:20,042 --> 00:32:21,975
Hey, this is so amazing.

755
00:32:22,542 --> 00:32:24,075
Hey, I read this in the book.

756
00:32:24,075 --> 00:32:26,975
This is the most symmetric building.

757
00:32:26,975 --> 00:32:28,742
Even the color is beautiful.

758
00:32:34,642 --> 00:32:36,208
I want to climb up there.

759
00:32:36,208 --> 00:32:38,208
You have to go barefoot outside too.

760
00:32:38,208 --> 00:32:41,108
- You have to be barefoot outdoors? / - Yes.

761
00:32:41,108 --> 00:32:42,808
We have to show our respect.

762
00:32:42,808 --> 00:32:44,542
If you climb up here...

763
00:32:44,542 --> 00:32:47,242
- That's so pretty. / - That's such a great photo.

764
00:32:47,242 --> 00:32:50,608
How about we look for a spot with this view?

765
00:32:50,608 --> 00:32:52,475
That's what I thought.

766
00:32:52,475 --> 00:32:55,575
- We could look on our bikes. / - Yeah, let's go.

767
00:32:59,342 --> 00:33:01,308
- Is this it? / - Here.

768
00:33:01,308 --> 00:33:03,442
- It's so easy to get around there. / - We're here.

769
00:33:03,442 --> 00:33:05,608
Yes, it was so convenient.

770
00:33:05,608 --> 00:33:06,542
So hot.

771
00:33:07,275 --> 00:33:09,008
(This is the real lime juice)

772
00:33:09,008 --> 00:33:10,375
Lime juice?

773
00:33:10,375 --> 00:33:12,075
Electric.

774
00:33:12,075 --> 00:33:14,608
A glass of that when you're hot and you're good to go.

775
00:33:14,608 --> 00:33:16,742
Can we get one original

776
00:33:16,742 --> 00:33:17,775
and one mint?

777
00:33:20,508 --> 00:33:23,242
(She casts a magic spell to quicken their order)

778
00:33:23,642 --> 00:33:26,708
- Hi. / - This is the lime juice, miss.

779
00:33:26,708 --> 00:33:29,442
- With mint? / - Yes, with mint.

780
00:33:30,075 --> 00:33:31,075
How much was that?

781
00:33:31,075 --> 00:33:33,875
1,900 kyats. So around $1.50?

782
00:33:33,875 --> 00:33:35,875
Great price.

783
00:33:35,875 --> 00:33:37,742
Lime is the best to quench your thirst.

784
00:33:38,342 --> 00:33:41,442
Fresh fruit juices in Myanmar are really good.

785
00:33:41,442 --> 00:33:43,375
We had the lime juice because the country

786
00:33:43,375 --> 00:33:46,308
was best known for it and we couldn't stop.

787
00:33:46,308 --> 00:33:48,875
Hot countries have tasty fruits.

788
00:33:52,775 --> 00:33:54,175
Try this.

789
00:33:54,175 --> 00:33:55,408
This is so cool.

790
00:33:59,108 --> 00:34:01,308
(This is delicious)

791
00:34:03,142 --> 00:34:05,608
The original one tastes just like lime.

792
00:34:07,342 --> 00:34:09,275
The scent of the lime is great.

793
00:34:10,708 --> 00:34:12,942
I just thought limes are sour

794
00:34:12,942 --> 00:34:14,042
but it has a scent.

795
00:34:14,042 --> 00:34:17,475
I don't normally like sour drinks.

796
00:34:17,475 --> 00:34:19,642
But it's not overpoweringly sour.

797
00:34:19,642 --> 00:34:22,108
I feel like I'm taking in a month's worth of vitamins.

798
00:34:22,108 --> 00:34:23,575
My gosh, this is so cool.

799
00:34:25,375 --> 00:34:27,942
(How does the lime juice with mint taste?)

800
00:34:28,542 --> 00:34:31,775
(It seems she drinks to live)

801
00:34:31,775 --> 00:34:33,842
Is someone chasing you?

802
00:34:34,642 --> 00:34:35,808
I love this.

803
00:34:36,242 --> 00:34:40,242
Doesn't the one with mint taste like a mojito?

804
00:34:40,242 --> 00:34:43,175
It does, but after some time passes,

805
00:34:43,175 --> 00:34:47,008
the scent of the mint makes its way back in my body.

806
00:34:47,008 --> 00:34:49,408
If I had to recommend just one drink...

807
00:34:50,742 --> 00:34:52,375
Mint.

808
00:34:52,375 --> 00:34:54,308
Me too. Mint.

809
00:34:54,308 --> 00:34:56,542
- Right? That one is better. / - Lime with mint.

810
00:34:56,542 --> 00:35:00,208
The fragrance of the herb is stronger than usual.

811
00:35:00,208 --> 00:35:03,475
It sort of puts you in a good mood.

812
00:35:04,808 --> 00:35:07,708
I bet it feels like you brushed your teeth after that.

813
00:35:07,708 --> 00:35:09,608
- You'd feel refreshed. / - Should we ask them?

814
00:35:09,608 --> 00:35:10,375
Ask what?

815
00:35:10,375 --> 00:35:12,542
If there's a temple we can climb.

816
00:35:14,742 --> 00:35:16,175
(He's the target)

817
00:35:16,175 --> 00:35:19,775
Excuse me, we want to take these kinds of pictures

818
00:35:19,775 --> 00:35:23,175
on top of the pagoda.

819
00:35:23,942 --> 00:35:26,775
After the earthquake... The temples you can climb up...

820
00:35:26,775 --> 00:35:28,608
After the earthquake, you can't.

821
00:35:28,608 --> 00:35:31,508
Because it's very dangerous.

822
00:35:31,508 --> 00:35:33,242
You know the last 2 years?

823
00:35:33,242 --> 00:35:36,542
Last 2016, again, earthquake.

824
00:35:38,475 --> 00:35:42,075
One of the temples,

825
00:35:42,075 --> 00:35:44,708
you can climb up.

826
00:35:44,708 --> 00:35:47,242
But it is very hard to find.

827
00:35:48,008 --> 00:35:49,308
In the middle.

828
00:35:49,308 --> 00:35:50,742
Around here.

829
00:35:50,742 --> 00:35:52,775
Like about around here?

830
00:35:52,775 --> 00:35:53,575
Yes, around here.

831
00:35:54,108 --> 00:35:57,808
Could you take us? We'll follow you.

832
00:35:57,808 --> 00:35:58,942
Yes.

833
00:35:58,942 --> 00:36:00,775
- Okay? / - Okay, yes. Perfect.

834
00:36:03,008 --> 00:36:04,142
He said yes so easily.

835
00:36:04,142 --> 00:36:06,508
He's saying yes to everything.

836
00:36:06,508 --> 00:36:08,042
Thank you, thank you.

837
00:36:08,042 --> 00:36:09,242
Let's go after we finish the drinks.

838
00:36:09,242 --> 00:36:11,608
Most of the people in Myanmar are really nice.

839
00:36:11,608 --> 00:36:13,008
I heard they're really kind.

840
00:36:13,008 --> 00:36:13,975
They're so nice.

841
00:36:13,975 --> 00:36:17,608
I met one on this show with foreigners.

842
00:36:17,608 --> 00:36:20,208
- The person on the show was nice. / - Really?

843
00:36:20,208 --> 00:36:22,275
It's a Buddhist country, and they're really nice.

844
00:36:22,275 --> 00:36:24,408
They're nice to foreigners.

845
00:36:24,408 --> 00:36:26,075
Let's get going.

846
00:36:31,075 --> 00:36:33,108
There are a lot of temples here.

847
00:36:35,342 --> 00:36:38,408
(Firefighting Tour cuts through the forest in Bagan)

848
00:36:39,708 --> 00:36:43,642
(She's happy with the thought of taking photos)

849
00:36:46,875 --> 00:36:49,908
Go faster!

850
00:36:50,408 --> 00:36:52,608
Don't you think you're going too fast?

851
00:36:53,075 --> 00:36:56,642
Please!

852
00:36:57,075 --> 00:36:58,208
My gosh.

853
00:37:02,075 --> 00:37:03,942
Hey, this looks like the countryside.

854
00:37:06,342 --> 00:37:08,875
It must be hard to find this one.

855
00:37:09,908 --> 00:37:12,908
(At the end of the trail, a temple comes into view)

856
00:37:14,108 --> 00:37:15,208
There's a woman. A woman.

857
00:37:15,208 --> 00:37:16,908
Where is she?

858
00:37:16,908 --> 00:37:18,708
- She's on the left. It's a woman. / - Yes, I see her.

859
00:37:18,708 --> 00:37:20,708
- That's the place. / - Photo zone!

860
00:37:20,708 --> 00:37:21,575
Amazing.

861
00:37:21,575 --> 00:37:24,675
I think you can't come here unless you know.

862
00:37:24,675 --> 00:37:27,875
You can't find this place on your own.

863
00:37:27,875 --> 00:37:30,375
- There are too many temples. / - Right.

864
00:37:30,375 --> 00:37:31,475
This temple doesn't have a name.

865
00:37:31,475 --> 00:37:33,742
It means people don't know about it.

866
00:37:33,742 --> 00:37:36,908
- Then there aren't any signs? / - There's none.

867
00:37:36,908 --> 00:37:39,908
- Do you have to go barefoot there too? / - Yes.

868
00:37:41,442 --> 00:37:42,142
Goodness.

869
00:37:43,208 --> 00:37:44,575
(Surprised)

870
00:37:46,675 --> 00:37:48,875
Seeing it from the ground and seeing it from the top...

871
00:37:48,875 --> 00:37:50,675
- Is completely different. / - It's not the same at all.

872
00:37:52,142 --> 00:37:53,275
I don't believe it.

873
00:37:53,275 --> 00:37:54,842
It's so picturesque.

874
00:37:54,842 --> 00:37:57,508
There are over 3,000 temples.

875
00:37:57,508 --> 00:37:59,108
There are no supermarkets in between.

876
00:37:59,108 --> 00:38:01,242
It's just all temples.

877
00:38:02,342 --> 00:38:04,508
- So pretty. / - Unbelievable.

878
00:38:07,008 --> 00:38:10,075
But why are there so many temples in Bagan?

879
00:38:10,075 --> 00:38:12,875
The king of the Bagan Kingdom

880
00:38:12,875 --> 00:38:16,008
was a devout Buddhist.

881
00:38:16,008 --> 00:38:18,342
In order to popularize Buddhism,

882
00:38:18,342 --> 00:38:20,075
he built these temples.

883
00:38:20,508 --> 00:38:21,742
To popularize his faith?

884
00:38:21,742 --> 00:38:23,575
He wanted to spread Buddhism.

885
00:38:23,575 --> 00:38:27,042
That's how it became the most practiced religion.

886
00:38:27,042 --> 00:38:28,775
There are no residential areas

887
00:38:28,775 --> 00:38:30,575
between the temples at all.

888
00:38:30,575 --> 00:38:31,375
Not at all.

889
00:38:31,375 --> 00:38:33,975
- There's the photo of a lifetime. / - So pretty.

890
00:38:33,975 --> 00:38:35,375
Did you get one?

891
00:38:35,375 --> 00:38:37,542
- So pretty. / - Yes, we got our photos.

892
00:38:37,542 --> 00:38:38,575
You did.

893
00:38:41,875 --> 00:38:45,208
See that? The cylindrical building?

894
00:38:45,208 --> 00:38:46,475
- The high one? / - Yes.

895
00:38:46,475 --> 00:38:49,075
There's a famous infinity pool there.

896
00:38:49,075 --> 00:38:52,608
We'll enjoy the pool as we watch the sunset.

897
00:38:52,608 --> 00:38:53,575
Amazing.

898
00:38:53,575 --> 00:38:55,475
What a pretty picture.

899
00:38:55,475 --> 00:38:57,042
- Is that your hotel? / - Yes.

900
00:38:58,875 --> 00:39:00,108
It looks so great from above.

901
00:39:00,108 --> 00:39:02,375
Whenever this song plays, something weird happens.

902
00:39:08,942 --> 00:39:11,242
She looks like a game character.

903
00:39:11,242 --> 00:39:13,742
(The water goddess that defeats the hot weather)

904
00:39:16,275 --> 00:39:17,442
That's confidence.

905
00:39:18,775 --> 00:39:20,675
This is amazing.

906
00:39:21,375 --> 00:39:23,542
- Isn't it pretty? / - I'm so jealous.

907
00:39:26,508 --> 00:39:28,542
- It's so nice here. / - So pretty.

908
00:39:28,542 --> 00:39:30,842
Hotels with those kind of view costs a lot.

909
00:39:30,842 --> 00:39:33,342
That hotel was only $100 something.

910
00:39:34,508 --> 00:39:37,175
Hey, wait. This is way deeper than I thought.

911
00:39:37,175 --> 00:39:38,942
It's very deep.

912
00:39:42,108 --> 00:39:45,175
- You can't even swim? / - No. How did you know?

913
00:39:46,508 --> 00:39:48,075
Just all books...

914
00:39:48,775 --> 00:39:50,408
You need to grab the ledge.

915
00:39:50,408 --> 00:39:54,375
(Holding the ledge and enjoying the view of the temple)

916
00:39:58,542 --> 00:40:00,542
(They come face to face with Bagan's hot sunset)

917
00:40:00,542 --> 00:40:02,142
- The sunset is beautiful. / - Isn't it beautiful?

918
00:40:02,142 --> 00:40:02,908
It's so pretty.

919
00:40:02,908 --> 00:40:06,008
You can watch the sunset from there.

920
00:40:07,842 --> 00:40:08,708
That's so beautiful.

921
00:40:08,708 --> 00:40:11,142
- It's so beautiful. / - It was the perfect time.

922
00:40:11,142 --> 00:40:13,342
It feels like a garden.

923
00:40:14,042 --> 00:40:18,342
I really do feel like I'm in an unknown world.

924
00:40:19,775 --> 00:40:21,042
So pretty.

925
00:40:21,508 --> 00:40:24,575
Seeing the temple in the water...

926
00:40:24,575 --> 00:40:26,942
I like going to places

927
00:40:26,942 --> 00:40:30,608
but spending time like this is also great.

928
00:40:31,775 --> 00:40:34,908
You can see the sunset to end the day.

929
00:40:36,408 --> 00:40:38,508
It was so hot today.

930
00:40:38,508 --> 00:40:42,242
But this nice swimming pool is the perfect finish.

931
00:40:43,275 --> 00:40:44,475
This place is so nice.

932
00:40:44,475 --> 00:40:46,075
I really want to go there.

933
00:40:46,075 --> 00:40:47,808
- The night view was also amazing. / - $100 is...

934
00:40:47,808 --> 00:40:48,375
So affordable.

935
00:40:48,375 --> 00:40:50,342
I just want to stay there for 3 days.

936
00:40:50,342 --> 00:40:52,075
What was the most fun for you?

937
00:40:52,075 --> 00:40:53,408
- For today? / - Yes.

938
00:40:53,408 --> 00:40:55,475
I really liked riding bikes.

939
00:40:55,475 --> 00:40:57,142
If it wasn't for that,

940
00:40:57,142 --> 00:40:59,008
I wouldn't have enjoyed the temple tour.

941
00:40:59,008 --> 00:41:01,075
You said you didn't like looking at temples.

942
00:41:01,075 --> 00:41:03,075
I think it would have been boring for me.

943
00:41:03,075 --> 00:41:05,275
But it wasn't because we rode the bikes.

944
00:41:06,075 --> 00:41:08,908
It felt really exciting.

945
00:41:09,575 --> 00:41:11,775
I really liked going to the top.

946
00:41:13,508 --> 00:41:14,875
It was like a secret garden.

947
00:41:15,608 --> 00:41:17,608
We saw the sunset today.

948
00:41:18,175 --> 00:41:20,875
We're going to see the sunrise tomorrow.

949
00:41:20,875 --> 00:41:22,008
Really?

950
00:41:22,008 --> 00:41:25,042
We're going to see all of Bagan

951
00:41:25,042 --> 00:41:28,608
from in the sky.

952
00:41:28,608 --> 00:41:29,708
Okay.

953
00:41:29,708 --> 00:41:31,675
- From the sky? / - Yes, from the sky.

954
00:41:31,675 --> 00:41:34,975
Firefighting tour, bboom bboom.

955
00:41:34,975 --> 00:41:37,608
- It's so nice. / - It's really nice.

956
00:41:37,608 --> 00:41:38,575
It's amazing.

957
00:41:38,908 --> 00:41:41,408
There aren't a lot of Korean tourists, right?

958
00:41:41,408 --> 00:41:43,008
I don't think I saw any.

959
00:41:43,008 --> 00:41:44,975
There were a lot of Europeans.

960
00:41:44,975 --> 00:41:46,842
Europeans like things like this.

961
00:41:46,842 --> 00:41:47,675
People don't go to Myanmar a lot.

962
00:41:47,675 --> 00:41:49,742
Who would have gone to Bagan?

963
00:41:51,342 --> 00:41:52,675
4 a.m.?

964
00:41:52,675 --> 00:41:54,875
Why did you wake up so early?

965
00:41:54,875 --> 00:41:55,908
We had to start early

966
00:41:55,908 --> 00:41:58,008
because this was the highlight.

967
00:41:58,008 --> 00:41:59,408
How do you feel?

968
00:41:59,408 --> 00:42:02,975
- Starlings are chirping. / - Are you still not awake?

969
00:42:04,675 --> 00:42:06,008
Isn't this too much?

970
00:42:06,008 --> 00:42:09,075
But we really have to see this.

971
00:42:09,075 --> 00:42:11,408
This is the highlight of the fire day.

972
00:42:11,408 --> 00:42:12,875
Hot air balloon?

973
00:42:13,942 --> 00:42:15,008
This is it.

974
00:42:15,008 --> 00:42:17,442
- Hot air balloon? / - So you have to go early?

975
00:42:17,442 --> 00:42:19,208
I thought they were going to see the sunrise.

976
00:42:19,208 --> 00:42:20,875
We went there early to see the sunrise.

977
00:42:20,875 --> 00:42:23,875
- Sunrise on a hot air balloon? / - Wow, amazing.

978
00:42:24,375 --> 00:42:26,342
They picked us up from the hotel.

979
00:42:26,342 --> 00:42:27,742
A bus comes to pick you up.

980
00:42:29,508 --> 00:42:31,242
- It's so pretty. / - It's interesting.

981
00:42:31,675 --> 00:42:32,942
We're leaving.

982
00:42:35,475 --> 00:42:39,408
I don't usually exaggerate but this is really worth it.

983
00:42:39,408 --> 00:42:42,742
I searched for photos. It's really pretty.

984
00:42:44,375 --> 00:42:47,375
Temples look really beautiful at night.

985
00:42:47,375 --> 00:42:50,108
It feels different looking at them in dark.

986
00:42:52,275 --> 00:42:54,475
I've never been on a hot air balloon before.

987
00:42:54,475 --> 00:42:55,708
- You haven't? / - No.

988
00:42:55,708 --> 00:42:58,608
I have really severe acrophobia.

989
00:43:00,375 --> 00:43:02,308
Why does it feel like I've been on one before?

990
00:43:02,308 --> 00:43:04,375
I'm not sure if I've been on one or not.

991
00:43:04,942 --> 00:43:06,775
I don't remember whether it was a dream or not.

992
00:43:06,775 --> 00:43:08,842
I feel like I've been on one.

993
00:43:08,842 --> 00:43:11,542
It's not easy to experience a hot air balloon.

994
00:43:11,542 --> 00:43:13,642
- The weather has to be nice. / - That's right.

995
00:43:13,642 --> 00:43:15,275
- It can't be too windy. / - That's right.

996
00:43:17,275 --> 00:43:19,875
This isn't the balloon, is it?

997
00:43:19,875 --> 00:43:21,575
I think it is.

998
00:43:22,008 --> 00:43:23,442
- That must be it. / - Oh, my.

999
00:43:24,142 --> 00:43:25,742
They rise all at once.

1000
00:43:25,742 --> 00:43:28,275
A few dozen hot air balloons...

1001
00:43:28,975 --> 00:43:31,608
That's why it's so pretty in the photos.

1002
00:43:31,608 --> 00:43:33,042
Because there are many balloons.

1003
00:43:34,242 --> 00:43:36,042
You have to lie down?

1004
00:43:36,042 --> 00:43:38,308
Does it really land like that?

1005
00:43:39,475 --> 00:43:41,142
Wow! Amazing.

1006
00:43:41,942 --> 00:43:43,742
When I first saw the photos...

1007
00:43:43,742 --> 00:43:45,642
- That's really big. / - They were huge.

1008
00:43:47,375 --> 00:43:49,275
I didn't know it would be that big.

1009
00:43:49,275 --> 00:43:50,575
- You're right. / - Look at this.

1010
00:43:54,342 --> 00:43:57,308
(It's slowly preparing to fly to the sky)

1011
00:43:57,308 --> 00:43:59,842
How many are there? There are so many.

1012
00:44:00,308 --> 00:44:02,542
This is so exciting. They're so pretty.

1013
00:44:03,375 --> 00:44:05,608
They're all standing up.

1014
00:44:07,608 --> 00:44:09,842
This is unbelievable.

1015
00:44:11,842 --> 00:44:13,775
(Dancing from excitement)

1016
00:44:14,842 --> 00:44:16,508
- She's full of excitement. / - She's still half asleep.

1017
00:44:16,508 --> 00:44:19,108
That's the most excited she's been on this trip.

1018
00:44:19,108 --> 00:44:20,542
I was too excited.

1019
00:44:20,542 --> 00:44:22,575
We, we, we...

1020
00:44:24,075 --> 00:44:25,575
(Running furiously)

1021
00:44:25,575 --> 00:44:27,208
They aren't tired anymore.

1022
00:44:27,208 --> 00:44:28,775
Of course. This is on...

1023
00:44:28,775 --> 00:44:31,542
- Many people's bucket lists. / - Right.

1024
00:44:32,208 --> 00:44:36,042
(Boarding complete)

1025
00:44:36,542 --> 00:44:39,142
Do they have a weight limit?

1026
00:44:39,142 --> 00:44:40,475
They did check our weights.

1027
00:44:40,475 --> 00:44:42,708
Because there's a limit to the number of people.

1028
00:44:42,708 --> 00:44:44,208
Is that a problem?

1029
00:44:44,208 --> 00:44:45,975
I'll have to check.

1030
00:44:47,708 --> 00:44:49,508
(They got on bravely but they're actually scared)

1031
00:44:49,508 --> 00:44:53,308
Sorry, folks. You'll have to get used to that.

1032
00:44:53,308 --> 00:44:54,308
I was so...

1033
00:44:54,308 --> 00:44:57,008
(Continuous blast)

1034
00:45:01,875 --> 00:45:04,975
- Are you there with tourists? / - Yes.

1035
00:45:05,542 --> 00:45:06,108
I see.

1036
00:45:06,108 --> 00:45:08,975
People who were on the same bus go on the same balloon.

1037
00:45:10,775 --> 00:45:12,775
Thank you.

1038
00:45:15,375 --> 00:45:18,342
(The hot air balloon leaves)

1039
00:45:18,708 --> 00:45:19,875
It's rising.

1040
00:45:22,242 --> 00:45:24,108
Isn't it so pretty?

1041
00:45:24,575 --> 00:45:27,642
I'm really going to try this in Myanmar.

1042
00:45:27,642 --> 00:45:29,408
Even the bus is adorable.

1043
00:45:30,408 --> 00:45:32,242
It rises quickly.

1044
00:45:36,508 --> 00:45:39,242
I thought that was a sunset but it was the morning.

1045
00:45:39,242 --> 00:45:39,908
It's the morning.

1046
00:45:39,908 --> 00:45:41,808
It's going up so high.

1047
00:45:41,808 --> 00:45:44,075
It goes up really high.

1048
00:45:44,075 --> 00:45:45,042
Wasn't it scary?

1049
00:45:45,042 --> 00:45:47,275
- Slightly. / - You could greet airplanes.

1050
00:45:50,075 --> 00:45:51,608
I'm so happy.

1051
00:45:53,342 --> 00:45:56,775
- The wind is refreshing. / - This is so moving.

1052
00:45:56,775 --> 00:45:58,908
You'd actually cry if you're up there.

1053
00:46:00,175 --> 00:46:02,375
When else could you see such a view?

1054
00:46:03,308 --> 00:46:05,675
- There are so many temples. / - It's so pretty.

1055
00:46:05,675 --> 00:46:06,875
The air balloons are pretty.

1056
00:46:07,975 --> 00:46:09,375
I'm so happy.

1057
00:46:09,375 --> 00:46:10,308
This is so great.

1058
00:46:10,308 --> 00:46:13,408
- N, you should go there. / - I really want to.

1059
00:46:14,908 --> 00:46:17,142
Look. Isn't that so pretty?

1060
00:46:17,675 --> 00:46:19,342
There isn't a set course.

1061
00:46:19,342 --> 00:46:21,808
The wind conditions of the day

1062
00:46:21,808 --> 00:46:23,108
determine where you go.

1063
00:46:23,108 --> 00:46:26,075
- Look down there... / - So it's new every day.

1064
00:46:27,942 --> 00:46:30,442
I thought she was still because she was moved.

1065
00:46:30,442 --> 00:46:32,342
But she was scared.

1066
00:46:32,342 --> 00:46:35,308
Actually, I have severe acrophobia)

1067
00:46:35,308 --> 00:46:36,908
Really?

1068
00:46:36,908 --> 00:46:40,808
But since I can't tell how high I'm up on a balloon...

1069
00:46:42,708 --> 00:46:45,008
(It's such a realistic height)

1070
00:46:46,275 --> 00:46:47,675
I'm scared.

1071
00:46:48,975 --> 00:46:49,775
You just need to look straight ahead.

1072
00:46:51,508 --> 00:46:54,142
- I can't look. / - You don't look well.

1073
00:46:54,142 --> 00:46:55,775
Wait a minute.

1074
00:46:55,775 --> 00:46:59,075
Everything looks so adorable while looking down.

1075
00:46:59,075 --> 00:47:02,142
Sojin is really fearless.

1076
00:47:02,142 --> 00:47:05,208
I couldn't feel the distance, so I wasn't scared.

1077
00:47:06,308 --> 00:47:08,542
- You regret coming up here, don't you? / - No.

1078
00:47:09,475 --> 00:47:13,975
- Look down. It's like a picture. / - No. It's okay.

1079
00:47:16,608 --> 00:47:18,442
We do this when we really can't stand something.

1080
00:47:20,242 --> 00:47:21,575
In that low tone.

1081
00:47:21,575 --> 00:47:23,108
Look behind.

1082
00:47:27,408 --> 00:47:28,942
She looks so unhappy.

1083
00:47:28,942 --> 00:47:29,942
That's so funny.

1084
00:47:29,942 --> 00:47:31,242
She looked with her philtrum.

1085
00:47:32,008 --> 00:47:33,775
It's really pretty.

1086
00:47:33,775 --> 00:47:35,175
- It really is. / - It's really amazing.

1087
00:47:35,175 --> 00:47:37,542
- I want to go there this year. / - It's quite big.

1088
00:47:37,542 --> 00:47:39,375
- Me too. / - I could do it even if I'm scared.

1089
00:47:40,542 --> 00:47:44,775
(Even if your burning heart bursts)

1090
00:47:44,775 --> 00:47:46,675
The sun is rising on the other side.

1091
00:47:46,675 --> 00:47:49,175
You can see temples on this side.

1092
00:47:49,175 --> 00:47:52,008
You can do it even if you're acrophobic.

1093
00:47:52,008 --> 00:47:57,275
(Let's get soaked in the sunlight)

1094
00:47:58,808 --> 00:48:00,842
It's so beautiful.

1095
00:48:02,075 --> 00:48:04,275
I was scared because I was acrophobic

1096
00:48:04,275 --> 00:48:06,542
but I would've regretted it if I didn't try this.

1097
00:48:06,542 --> 00:48:09,508
I really would've regretted it if I didn't do this.

1098
00:48:10,375 --> 00:48:13,242
(The greeting of the innocent people warms your heart)

1099
00:48:14,142 --> 00:48:15,708
I'm so happy.

1100
00:48:15,708 --> 00:48:17,275
It's like a dream.

1101
00:48:18,942 --> 00:48:21,242
- She's crying. / - I was so happy.

1102
00:48:21,242 --> 00:48:23,808
You cry when you see a really beautiful sight.

1103
00:48:23,808 --> 00:48:26,308
I had such a strange feeling.

1104
00:48:26,308 --> 00:48:26,942
I know.

1105
00:48:26,942 --> 00:48:29,008
You cry when you see beauty.

1106
00:48:29,008 --> 00:48:32,575
Where would we be able to see historic sites

1107
00:48:32,575 --> 00:48:33,975
on a hot air balloon?

1108
00:48:33,975 --> 00:48:37,242
I think you can only do this in Bagan, Myanmar.

1109
00:48:41,908 --> 00:48:44,408
In my opinion...

1110
00:48:45,008 --> 00:48:50,208
Myanmar is the best among Southeast Asian trips.

1111
00:48:51,842 --> 00:48:54,442
- You're right. / - It's very charming.

1112
00:48:54,442 --> 00:48:55,642
Thank you.

1113
00:48:58,342 --> 00:48:59,708
- What is that? / - I'm about to cry.

1114
00:48:59,708 --> 00:49:01,342
Is this included in the $30?

1115
00:49:01,342 --> 00:49:03,108
Yes. It's unlimited.

1116
00:49:03,108 --> 00:49:05,208
- What? / - You can drink an unlimited amount.

1117
00:49:05,208 --> 00:49:07,042
- It can't be unlimited. / - It's unlimited.

1118
00:49:07,042 --> 00:49:07,808
I mean it.

1119
00:49:08,608 --> 00:49:09,608
- Suji. / - Yes?

1120
00:49:10,308 --> 00:49:13,008
I'm about to cry just seeing that.

1121
00:49:13,008 --> 00:49:15,375
- What? / - Because of the unlimited food.

1122
00:49:15,942 --> 00:49:18,542
She didn't feel anything while they were in the sky.

1123
00:49:22,275 --> 00:49:24,175
(Wasn't it worth coming here in the morning?)

1124
00:49:24,675 --> 00:49:26,475
Thank you for enjoying it.

1125
00:49:26,475 --> 00:49:28,275
Thank you for bringing me here. Thank you.

1126
00:49:28,275 --> 00:49:29,508
Cheers.

1127
00:49:29,942 --> 00:49:31,075
Thank you.

1128
00:49:32,542 --> 00:49:38,042
(The fire day has come to an end)

1129
00:49:38,042 --> 00:49:41,275
- You came back to Yangon from Bagan, right? / - Yes.

1130
00:49:41,275 --> 00:49:43,175
- We came back to Yangon. / - On the plane back.

1131
00:49:43,175 --> 00:49:45,042
It's burning up.

1132
00:49:45,042 --> 00:49:46,675
I'm watching you.

1133
00:49:46,675 --> 00:49:47,608
Look forward to it.

1134
00:49:51,275 --> 00:49:53,508
(Water goddess is summoned)

1135
00:49:53,508 --> 00:49:56,208
It's my day. It's Sojin's day from today.

1136
00:49:56,208 --> 00:49:57,508
It's water day.

1137
00:49:57,508 --> 00:50:00,608
I invite you to the world of water.

1138
00:50:04,975 --> 00:50:06,742
You're all dead!

1139
00:50:08,808 --> 00:50:11,142
(The Thingyan Festival)

1140
00:50:11,142 --> 00:50:12,175
Expect a lot.

1141
00:50:12,608 --> 00:50:14,442
It's the day of water.

1142
00:50:14,442 --> 00:50:16,442
I really want to try those noodles.

1143
00:50:16,442 --> 00:50:17,508
Oh, my.

1144
00:50:18,708 --> 00:50:19,908
It's so cool.

1145
00:50:20,408 --> 00:50:21,675
It's so cool.

1146
00:50:22,608 --> 00:50:25,908
We'll start the water day of the Firefighting Tour.

1147
00:50:25,908 --> 00:50:27,208
Bboom bboom!

1148
00:50:33,775 --> 00:50:35,775
Now I'm attacking.

1149
00:50:35,775 --> 00:50:37,075
We haven't seen this before.

1150
00:50:44,542 --> 00:50:46,942
(Flailing)

1151
00:50:48,675 --> 00:50:50,508
There's just something weird.

1152
00:50:50,508 --> 00:50:52,575
She looks somewhat awkward, yet she's having fun.

1153
00:50:52,575 --> 00:50:55,408
- She's offbeat. / - She's having fun.

1154
00:50:55,408 --> 00:50:58,342
It's like walking like this.

1155
00:50:58,342 --> 00:50:59,008
That's right.

1156
00:50:59,008 --> 00:51:01,708
You should've done this.

1157
00:51:02,142 --> 00:51:05,542
(Kandawgyi Lake)

1158
00:51:05,642 --> 00:51:08,442
Today is my day. Sojin's day.

1159
00:51:08,442 --> 00:51:09,442
It's day of water.

1160
00:51:09,442 --> 00:51:12,908
We're going to start off at this lake.

1161
00:51:13,442 --> 00:51:15,675
This lake is called Kandawgyi Lake.

1162
00:51:15,675 --> 00:51:17,375
"Kan" means lake in the local language.

1163
00:51:17,375 --> 00:51:18,775
- Where is that? / - Kandawgyi.

1164
00:51:18,775 --> 00:51:19,708
Did such a place exist?

1165
00:51:19,708 --> 00:51:22,508
- It does look like a city here. / - Yes.

1166
00:51:22,508 --> 00:51:23,342
It's like a city, right?

1167
00:51:23,342 --> 00:51:27,342
(Kandawgyi Lake is a popular dating spot)

1168
00:51:28,075 --> 00:51:30,342
I think they went to that lake.

1169
00:51:30,342 --> 00:51:32,175
- Really? / - Kim Suyong and Park Hwisun.

1170
00:51:34,508 --> 00:51:36,108
I don't have any recollection of it.

1171
00:51:36,408 --> 00:51:37,775
I don't have any recollection of it.

1172
00:51:37,775 --> 00:51:39,375
By the way, it's too hot.

1173
00:51:39,375 --> 00:51:41,175
- It's so hot. / - Isn't your day over yet?

1174
00:51:41,608 --> 00:51:44,575
It's fire here. There's a golden tower.

1175
00:51:44,575 --> 00:51:47,608
Oh, that. It's called Shwedagon Pagoda.

1176
00:51:47,608 --> 00:51:49,542
It's the landmark of the city.

1177
00:51:49,542 --> 00:51:50,508
- Really? / - Yes.

1178
00:51:50,508 --> 00:51:52,342
Everybody who visits Myanmar visits it.

1179
00:51:52,342 --> 00:51:54,875
- I think I saw a photo. / - It was on Battle Trip.

1180
00:51:54,875 --> 00:51:56,275
Right.

1181
00:51:56,275 --> 00:51:58,642
Why is it so different to when Suyong went there?

1182
00:51:59,208 --> 00:52:01,008
Is it really the same place Hwisun went?

1183
00:52:01,942 --> 00:52:06,042
Anyway, I was thinking of taking a train.

1184
00:52:06,042 --> 00:52:07,708
- We need to take a train? / - Yes.

1185
00:52:07,708 --> 00:52:10,208
Just like Line 2 on the Seoul metro,

1186
00:52:10,208 --> 00:52:12,175
there's a train that goes around Yangon.

1187
00:52:12,175 --> 00:52:14,208
- It's 16 cents. / - It's a circulating train.

1188
00:52:14,208 --> 00:52:15,142
It's so cheap.

1189
00:52:15,142 --> 00:52:17,108
The train ticket is 16 cents?

1190
00:52:17,108 --> 00:52:17,775
Yes.

1191
00:52:17,775 --> 00:52:21,042
- It's like Line 2. / - Among the foods related to water...

1192
00:52:21,042 --> 00:52:23,242
There's food that I really wanted to eat

1193
00:52:23,242 --> 00:52:26,308
when I came to Myanmar.

1194
00:52:26,308 --> 00:52:28,008
You have to eat noodles in Southeast Asia.

1195
00:52:29,808 --> 00:52:31,142
- Look forward to it. / - Alright.

1196
00:52:31,142 --> 00:52:32,708
- Let's go. / - My first time on a train in Myanmar.

1197
00:52:32,708 --> 00:52:34,075
Me too. Let's go.

1198
00:52:35,342 --> 00:52:36,708
(Kandawgyi Lake)

1199
00:52:36,708 --> 00:52:37,842
(Puzundaung Station)

1200
00:52:37,842 --> 00:52:40,175
(17-minute walk)

1201
00:52:40,808 --> 00:52:42,875
- Right. / - It's such an old train.

1202
00:52:45,675 --> 00:52:49,175
You learned how to read the letters, right?

1203
00:52:49,175 --> 00:52:52,875
No, I don't know the letters.

1204
00:52:52,875 --> 00:52:54,975
I just memorized the name of the place we're going.

1205
00:52:54,975 --> 00:52:57,042
Is it written in English as well or

1206
00:52:57,042 --> 00:52:58,308
is it only written in Burmese?

1207
00:52:58,308 --> 00:53:00,708
It's only written in Burmese.

1208
00:53:00,708 --> 00:53:02,242
Can they speak English though?

1209
00:53:02,242 --> 00:53:03,575
Yes, they can.

1210
00:53:03,575 --> 00:53:06,375
It doesn't matter where you're going.

1211
00:53:06,375 --> 00:53:08,508
1 ticket costs 200 kyats.

1212
00:53:08,508 --> 00:53:11,375
And you can go anywhere you want with the ticket.

1213
00:53:11,375 --> 00:53:14,775
So both you and I can travel for 40 cents.

1214
00:53:14,775 --> 00:53:16,208
It's so cheap.

1215
00:53:16,208 --> 00:53:17,275
Excuse me.

1216
00:53:20,108 --> 00:53:21,708
Two tickets please.

1217
00:53:22,708 --> 00:53:23,475
Pardon?

1218
00:53:23,475 --> 00:53:25,375
Not everyone speaks English.

1219
00:53:25,375 --> 00:53:26,508
Don't they speak English well?

1220
00:53:26,508 --> 00:53:29,942
Not as well as you think. Some are really good.

1221
00:53:30,975 --> 00:53:32,742
Most speak Burmese.

1222
00:53:33,308 --> 00:53:34,975
- Two tickets please. / - That's why you spoke in Korean?

1223
00:53:34,975 --> 00:53:36,475
Yes, so long as he understood.

1224
00:53:39,375 --> 00:53:40,542
60 cents.

1225
00:53:40,542 --> 00:53:42,175
- Bye. / - I think the train is coming.

1226
00:53:43,475 --> 00:53:44,375
No.

1227
00:53:46,275 --> 00:53:48,408
We can't miss this, right?

1228
00:53:48,408 --> 00:53:49,808
No, no.

1229
00:53:49,808 --> 00:53:51,608
Wait a minute.

1230
00:53:51,608 --> 00:53:54,042
- Oh, no! / - You were wasting time...

1231
00:53:54,042 --> 00:53:55,608
Without realizing.

1232
00:53:56,108 --> 00:53:57,408
Can we get on this?

1233
00:53:57,408 --> 00:53:58,608
Is this right?

1234
00:53:59,308 --> 00:54:00,642
Just carry this on?

1235
00:54:01,308 --> 00:54:03,542
After she made up her mind...

1236
00:54:04,042 --> 00:54:06,408
He told them to just get on.

1237
00:54:06,408 --> 00:54:07,775
It's like they're in Korea.

1238
00:54:13,308 --> 00:54:17,175
Don't they have to check our tickets?

1239
00:54:17,808 --> 00:54:19,408
Did they all give their tickets?

1240
00:54:19,408 --> 00:54:20,942
Maybe they don't check.

1241
00:54:21,542 --> 00:54:25,108
- Just in case... / - I'll hold on to it.

1242
00:54:27,208 --> 00:54:28,808
This train is so interesting.

1243
00:54:28,808 --> 00:54:31,075
There are no windows.

1244
00:54:31,542 --> 00:54:32,842
Goodness.

1245
00:54:32,842 --> 00:54:34,708
- It feels dangerous. / - You can get off.

1246
00:54:34,708 --> 00:54:35,808
There's no door either.

1247
00:54:36,475 --> 00:54:37,742
There's no door.

1248
00:54:37,742 --> 00:54:40,575
It'd be cool to stand out there.

1249
00:54:41,008 --> 00:54:42,842
You know where to get off, right?

1250
00:54:43,875 --> 00:54:46,075
- I know where, but... / - Don't make us worry.

1251
00:54:46,075 --> 00:54:48,408
Will they announce it? I can't read...

1252
00:54:49,442 --> 00:54:51,875
Let's see where we get off.

1253
00:54:52,742 --> 00:54:54,475
There was no announcement.

1254
00:54:54,908 --> 00:54:57,142
- So restless. / - You'd be so nervous.

1255
00:54:57,975 --> 00:54:59,342
Excuse me.

1256
00:55:00,275 --> 00:55:09,108
We're going to Central?

1257
00:55:10,008 --> 00:55:11,442
Central?

1258
00:55:11,442 --> 00:55:14,342
Central? Central?

1259
00:55:16,242 --> 00:55:17,908
Central Station.

1260
00:55:21,208 --> 00:55:22,575
She won't even look at you.

1261
00:55:22,575 --> 00:55:23,575
She's so cute.

1262
00:55:24,308 --> 00:55:26,108
- Central Station? / - Yes.

1263
00:55:27,675 --> 00:55:29,008
(She looks at her desperately)

1264
00:55:29,275 --> 00:55:31,508
I watched a fun TV show she was on.

1265
00:55:31,508 --> 00:55:34,242
Through that show, I realized she was very smart.

1266
00:55:34,242 --> 00:55:36,575
I heard she could speak different languages.

1267
00:55:36,575 --> 00:55:39,208
I can rely on her for communication issues.

1268
00:55:39,208 --> 00:55:42,408
Recently, I visited Boston, where I used to live.

1269
00:55:42,408 --> 00:55:44,008
- You used to live in Boston? / - Yes.

1270
00:55:44,008 --> 00:55:45,342
That's interesting.

1271
00:55:47,608 --> 00:55:50,008
(How good is her English?)

1272
00:55:50,775 --> 00:55:52,042
(Slurping?)

1273
00:55:52,042 --> 00:55:53,908
(Do you know the noodles restaurant?)

1274
00:55:54,342 --> 00:55:56,108
(Ayoung)

1275
00:55:57,108 --> 00:55:58,375
Look at her.

1276
00:56:00,175 --> 00:56:01,242
What are you doing?

1277
00:56:01,242 --> 00:56:02,975
I wanted to say we were going to eat noodles.

1278
00:56:04,508 --> 00:56:06,608
(She patiently explains)

1279
00:56:06,608 --> 00:56:10,208
Shan noodles? Do you know Shan noodle?

1280
00:56:10,642 --> 00:56:11,842
(They have great teamwork)

1281
00:56:11,842 --> 00:56:13,575
Shan noodles? You don't know?

1282
00:56:13,575 --> 00:56:15,575
(She's indeed a master of communication)

1283
00:56:16,908 --> 00:56:20,875
What happens if we miss our stop?

1284
00:56:20,875 --> 00:56:23,175
If we miss it? Then we take another train going back.

1285
00:56:23,175 --> 00:56:26,308
We can ride the train as much as we want.

1286
00:56:26,308 --> 00:56:28,242
- It's great, isn't it? / - No.

1287
00:56:29,975 --> 00:56:31,175
I think it's here.

1288
00:56:31,175 --> 00:56:33,508
It's here. I think it's here.

1289
00:56:33,508 --> 00:56:34,742
It think this is the station.

1290
00:56:34,742 --> 00:56:35,875
I was right.

1291
00:56:35,875 --> 00:56:37,175
- You found the station? / - Yes.

1292
00:56:37,175 --> 00:56:39,542
She just guessed.

1293
00:56:39,542 --> 00:56:41,275
Is this restaurant famous?

1294
00:56:41,675 --> 00:56:43,775
It's very famous.

1295
00:56:43,775 --> 00:56:46,508
It's popular among the locals.

1296
00:56:47,675 --> 00:56:50,208
If it's popular among the locals then it's really good.

1297
00:56:50,208 --> 00:56:51,242
Right.

1298
00:56:51,242 --> 00:56:52,908
Why is it called Shan noodles?

1299
00:56:52,908 --> 00:56:56,075
Shan people are the second biggest population here.

1300
00:56:56,075 --> 00:56:57,675
- Shan people? / - Yes.

1301
00:56:57,675 --> 00:57:00,308
This is the noodles Shan people eat often.

1302
00:57:00,308 --> 00:57:01,242
Is this it?

1303
00:57:01,242 --> 00:57:03,608
Doesn't the menu look like that of a good restaurant?

1304
00:57:04,008 --> 00:57:05,408
This place must be a good restaurant.

1305
00:57:05,408 --> 00:57:08,108
It's so crowded although it's so hot today.

1306
00:57:08,108 --> 00:57:12,008
This place is more popular among the locals.

1307
00:57:12,008 --> 00:57:14,208
There's one with soup and one without.

1308
00:57:14,208 --> 00:57:15,242
It looks delicious already.

1309
00:57:15,242 --> 00:57:16,875
- Let's order one each. / - It was so good.

1310
00:57:16,875 --> 00:57:18,008
- It's good. / - It is?

1311
00:57:18,008 --> 00:57:19,075
It's already good.

1312
00:57:19,875 --> 00:57:21,508
That was $1.60.

1313
00:57:22,675 --> 00:57:23,642
$1.60?

1314
00:57:23,642 --> 00:57:24,842
- Suji. / - Yes?

1315
00:57:24,842 --> 00:57:26,108
What do you think?

1316
00:57:26,108 --> 00:57:29,775
If it's $1.60, I could eat 1,600 bowls.

1317
00:57:31,375 --> 00:57:32,942
That's the good thing about traveling with your friend.

1318
00:57:32,942 --> 00:57:34,442
You can order two different dishes and share.

1319
00:57:34,442 --> 00:57:35,308
Chicken.

1320
00:57:35,308 --> 00:57:36,342
- Chicken. / - Chicken.

1321
00:57:36,542 --> 00:57:39,042
Chicken and pork for this one.

1322
00:57:40,208 --> 00:57:43,608
(Special sauce is added together with the meat sauce)

1323
00:57:43,608 --> 00:57:46,242
(Sticky Shan noodles salad complete)

1324
00:57:47,042 --> 00:57:49,808
(With well-cooked broth poured in it)

1325
00:57:49,808 --> 00:57:52,375
(Sticky Shan noodles complete)

1326
00:57:52,375 --> 00:57:53,642
It's ready.

1327
00:57:53,642 --> 00:57:56,008
I think our dishes are ready.

1328
00:57:56,008 --> 00:57:57,908
Okay.

1329
00:57:59,408 --> 00:58:01,108
- Ah, salad. / - Thank you.

1330
00:58:02,075 --> 00:58:03,775
There are many different ethnicities in Myanmar.

1331
00:58:03,775 --> 00:58:06,542
The biggest population is Burmese.

1332
00:58:06,542 --> 00:58:08,775
The second biggest is Shan.

1333
00:58:08,775 --> 00:58:11,242
- It looks so delicious. / - It's their staple food.

1334
00:58:12,242 --> 00:58:12,875
It looks so delicious.

1335
00:58:12,875 --> 00:58:14,875
$1.60 is so cheap.

1336
00:58:17,042 --> 00:58:20,075
It's a bit different from the rice noodles I imagined.

1337
00:58:22,042 --> 00:58:23,175
That's the mixed.

1338
00:58:25,342 --> 00:58:27,275
- It's like mixed noodles. / - Is it good, Sikyung?

1339
00:58:27,275 --> 00:58:28,775
- It's tasty right now. / - It's tasty no matter what?

1340
00:58:28,775 --> 00:58:30,308
It's tasty right now.

1341
00:58:31,142 --> 00:58:32,375
Ayoung, is it spicy?

1342
00:58:32,375 --> 00:58:34,475
- It's not spicy. / - It's a little spicy.

1343
00:58:34,475 --> 00:58:36,475
It has all kinds of flavor in it.

1344
00:58:36,475 --> 00:58:38,375
It's so sticky.

1345
00:58:38,742 --> 00:58:41,342
- It's like sticky rice. / - The noodles look very sticky.

1346
00:58:41,342 --> 00:58:43,442
- It was really sticky. / - Right?

1347
00:58:44,375 --> 00:58:46,375
I can feel the stickiness from the video.

1348
00:58:50,708 --> 00:58:52,175
Want to try watermelon juice?

1349
00:58:53,742 --> 00:58:54,975
Do you like it?

1350
00:58:55,608 --> 00:58:58,908
It's fried noodles that's like five spiced sauce

1351
00:58:58,908 --> 00:59:00,242
and black bean noodles.

1352
00:59:00,242 --> 00:59:03,208
- Mapo tofu. / - Yes, yes!

1353
00:59:03,208 --> 00:59:04,642
It's delicious.

1354
00:59:06,508 --> 00:59:07,442
Yes.

1355
00:59:07,442 --> 00:59:09,575
- No artificial spices. / - I get it.

1356
00:59:09,575 --> 00:59:11,675
It's a taste we've had.

1357
00:59:11,675 --> 00:59:13,608
I'd love to try that.

1358
00:59:13,608 --> 00:59:15,208
The noodles are

1359
00:59:15,208 --> 00:59:18,742
as chewy as hand-pulled noodles.

1360
00:59:18,742 --> 00:59:19,608
It's extremely chewy.

1361
00:59:19,608 --> 00:59:22,275
- It's a small serving. / - It's called sticky noodles.

1362
00:59:22,275 --> 00:59:24,675
It must be chewy and sticky.

1363
00:59:24,675 --> 00:59:27,342
It's made of sticky rice, so it's very filling.

1364
00:59:28,775 --> 00:59:32,108
If you take rice cake and really flatten it out,

1365
00:59:32,108 --> 00:59:34,742
I think it'd have this texture.

1366
00:59:36,108 --> 00:59:39,208
- Let's try the broth. / - Try it.

1367
00:59:39,708 --> 00:59:42,175
You need two bowls of this.

1368
00:59:44,142 --> 00:59:47,542
(Expectant)

1369
00:59:48,075 --> 00:59:51,842
Why do I taste bean paste from all the dishes here?

1370
00:59:51,842 --> 00:59:53,975
I think it tastes similar to bean paste noodles.

1371
00:59:55,242 --> 00:59:56,408
- Do you taste the bean paste? / - Yes.

1372
00:59:56,408 --> 00:59:58,442
- I'm not strange, right? / - I get the feeling now.

1373
00:59:58,442 --> 00:59:59,308
It tastes like bean paste noodles.

1374
00:59:59,808 --> 01:00:01,275
Like bean paste noodles.

1375
01:00:01,275 --> 01:00:02,408
Bean paste rice soup.

1376
01:00:03,175 --> 01:00:05,808
It's like rice soup.

1377
01:00:05,808 --> 01:00:08,142
This must be pork broth.

1378
01:00:08,708 --> 01:00:11,308
(Ayoung wonders what the sauces on the table are)

1379
01:00:12,942 --> 01:00:16,042
You know, we add sauces in rice soup in Korea.

1380
01:00:16,042 --> 01:00:17,975
- Can I add a little bit of it? / - Yes please.

1381
01:00:17,975 --> 01:00:19,408
- Can I? / - I love this sauce.

1382
01:00:19,408 --> 01:00:21,308
Let's mix it well. It might be spicier than we think.

1383
01:00:21,308 --> 01:00:23,908
It tastes similar to pork soup rice.

1384
01:00:24,342 --> 01:00:26,142
I love this.

1385
01:00:26,142 --> 01:00:27,575
This one looks more delicious.

1386
01:00:27,575 --> 01:00:29,908
There are different sauces you can add...

1387
01:00:29,908 --> 01:00:31,808
- To your liking. / - How is it?

1388
01:00:33,308 --> 01:00:35,508
(So happy)

1389
01:00:37,442 --> 01:00:39,075
It's sweet and spicy.

1390
01:00:39,775 --> 01:00:41,508
It's not what I expected.

1391
01:00:42,008 --> 01:00:43,408
It's better with the sauce.

1392
01:00:43,408 --> 01:00:45,442
If you like spicy food, you'll find this delicious.

1393
01:00:45,442 --> 01:00:46,642
It has a fiery taste.

1394
01:00:46,642 --> 01:00:49,208
- It's like chili oil. / - Oh, that's what it is.

1395
01:00:49,208 --> 01:00:50,775
- The aftertaste. / - It taste fiery.

1396
01:00:52,108 --> 01:00:53,708
Can I crush this and add it?

1397
01:00:55,208 --> 01:00:56,308
What's that?

1398
01:00:56,808 --> 01:01:00,075
It's like deep fried pork skin.

1399
01:01:00,075 --> 01:01:03,275
- With noodles... / - That's in the Philippines.

1400
01:01:03,275 --> 01:01:05,542
- Please save me. / - Why not?

1401
01:01:05,908 --> 01:01:06,642
Let's add it.

1402
01:01:09,042 --> 01:01:10,342
Try it. It's tasty.

1403
01:01:10,808 --> 01:01:12,808
Excuse me.

1404
01:01:13,708 --> 01:01:15,442
(Making a fuss)

1405
01:01:17,175 --> 01:01:19,675
Please give me a small bowl.

1406
01:01:20,775 --> 01:01:22,575
- Let's eat. / - Thank you.

1407
01:01:25,242 --> 01:01:26,442
It's good.

1408
01:01:31,908 --> 01:01:35,108
- You added it, didn't you? / - No, I didn't.

1409
01:01:35,108 --> 01:01:36,975
- You did. / - I didn't.

1410
01:01:36,975 --> 01:01:38,642
The soup tastes different.

1411
01:01:38,642 --> 01:01:40,275
No way.

1412
01:01:40,275 --> 01:01:41,775
It must've gone in when the bag exploded.

1413
01:01:41,775 --> 01:01:43,542
Why can't you tell me precisely?

1414
01:01:43,542 --> 01:01:46,742
The pressure inside the bag was high.

1415
01:01:46,742 --> 01:01:48,275
Some went in when it exploded.

1416
01:01:48,942 --> 01:01:50,908
I think it'd taste better with it.

1417
01:01:51,342 --> 01:01:54,275
Please give me a small bowl.

1418
01:01:55,142 --> 01:01:56,975
Personal dish.

1419
01:01:58,442 --> 01:02:00,342
(So much)

1420
01:02:02,675 --> 01:02:04,575
- You look calm. / - You're so quick.

1421
01:02:04,575 --> 01:02:06,808
You're so quick when you're doing that.

1422
01:02:08,375 --> 01:02:09,875
How does it taste?

1423
01:02:12,142 --> 01:02:14,242
(This isn't the taste I know)

1424
01:02:14,608 --> 01:02:17,008
The original taste is gone.

1425
01:02:19,775 --> 01:02:22,642
Is this revenge for the temple?

1426
01:02:22,642 --> 01:02:24,875
The meat stock taste is gone.

1427
01:02:24,875 --> 01:02:26,675
(Screaming)

1428
01:02:28,575 --> 01:02:31,375
- No! / - It looks better.

1429
01:02:31,975 --> 01:02:34,108
- Are you sure? / - I'll try it.

1430
01:02:34,708 --> 01:02:37,542
(Ayoung tastes it first to put Sojin at ease)

1431
01:02:40,442 --> 01:02:41,575
Hey, wait a minute.

1432
01:02:42,408 --> 01:02:44,075
Is it like crispy batter?

1433
01:02:44,075 --> 01:02:46,742
It has a crunchy texture.

1434
01:02:46,742 --> 01:02:47,875
This one's good.

1435
01:02:49,975 --> 01:02:51,942
(Ayoung is nervous)

1436
01:02:53,475 --> 01:02:55,375
(She agrees this time)

1437
01:02:57,342 --> 01:02:58,408
Was that okay?

1438
01:02:58,408 --> 01:03:00,342
Yes, that was tasty.

1439
01:03:00,342 --> 01:03:02,675
You can think of it as frying powder

1440
01:03:02,675 --> 01:03:04,108
like the one you put in udon.

1441
01:03:04,975 --> 01:03:07,942
Sprinkling the crispy pork powder was a great choice.

1442
01:03:07,942 --> 01:03:11,842
It was like eating spicy pork rice soup on a hot day.

1443
01:03:11,842 --> 01:03:14,742
It was savory. I really liked it.

1444
01:03:14,742 --> 01:03:15,942
That looks delicious.

1445
01:03:15,942 --> 01:03:18,475
Their noodles are great.

1446
01:03:18,475 --> 01:03:20,142
- I should try both noodles. / - Of course.

1447
01:03:20,142 --> 01:03:22,242
- The mixed and soup. / - Definitely.

1448
01:03:22,842 --> 01:03:27,342
Myanmar has traditional tea called lahpet.

1449
01:03:27,342 --> 01:03:29,242
It's water day.

1450
01:03:29,242 --> 01:03:32,042
Why do you keep suggesting hot things?

1451
01:03:32,042 --> 01:03:33,475
On this hot day.

1452
01:03:33,475 --> 01:03:35,775
- But the locals... / - Like hot soup.

1453
01:03:35,775 --> 01:03:38,608
Spicy food. Hot tea.

1454
01:03:38,608 --> 01:03:40,775
Why are you doing this?

1455
01:03:40,775 --> 01:03:43,275
It's the water festival tomorrow anyway.

1456
01:03:43,275 --> 01:03:46,508
So we're getting ready for that.

1457
01:03:47,175 --> 01:03:48,708
- Let's go. / - Let's go.

1458
01:03:49,208 --> 01:03:50,742
2,000 kyats. 2,000 kyats.

1459
01:03:50,742 --> 01:03:53,575
2,000, 2,000, 2,000, 2,500.

1460
01:03:56,175 --> 01:03:56,742
What?

1461
01:03:56,742 --> 01:03:57,542
No.

1462
01:03:58,008 --> 01:04:01,275
This one is 300.

1463
01:04:01,275 --> 01:04:02,842
This wasn't free.

1464
01:04:02,842 --> 01:04:05,742
So this one costs 300 kyats each.

1465
01:04:05,742 --> 01:04:08,608
I thought it was free because it was on the table.

1466
01:04:08,608 --> 01:04:11,708
You can mistake it for free.

1467
01:04:11,708 --> 01:04:13,775
- Still it's less than $10. / - Right.

1468
01:04:23,575 --> 01:04:25,075
Left hand, left hand.

1469
01:04:25,642 --> 01:04:27,008
- That's really weird. / - Left hand.

1470
01:04:27,675 --> 01:04:29,875
Right hand, right foot.

1471
01:04:29,875 --> 01:04:31,642
I was wondering what was weird.

1472
01:04:31,642 --> 01:04:33,442
She used the same side.

1473
01:04:36,442 --> 01:04:39,042
(Lahpet)

1474
01:04:40,108 --> 01:04:41,208
Where should we go?

1475
01:04:41,208 --> 01:04:43,742
- It's near 28th street. / - 28th street?

1476
01:04:43,742 --> 01:04:45,742
- It's frustrating since you can't read. / - 28th street.

1477
01:04:45,742 --> 01:04:47,208
You have to look for the numbers.

1478
01:04:47,675 --> 01:04:49,642
- This is it. This is 28th street. / - We're here.

1479
01:04:49,642 --> 01:04:50,875
We're here. We're here.

1480
01:04:50,875 --> 01:04:54,142
- Where is it? / - This is it. This yellow sign.

1481
01:04:54,142 --> 01:04:55,642
- Is this it? / - Yes, it is.

1482
01:04:55,642 --> 01:04:57,175
- This is it. This is it. / - You're right.

1483
01:04:57,175 --> 01:04:58,542
We're here!

1484
01:04:58,542 --> 01:05:00,175
This is fun.

1485
01:05:00,175 --> 01:05:03,175
- Going to a tea house to drink tea... / - Yes.

1486
01:05:03,175 --> 01:05:05,075
- In a foreign place. / - Yes.

1487
01:05:05,075 --> 01:05:06,408
(Lahpet)

1488
01:05:06,408 --> 01:05:09,208
(Famous tea house located in the 28th street)

1489
01:05:09,208 --> 01:05:12,675
(Traditional tea of Myanmar, similar to milk tea)

1490
01:05:12,675 --> 01:05:14,708
- It's traditional tea. / - Is it like milk tea?

1491
01:05:14,708 --> 01:05:16,575
It looks like milk tea.

1492
01:05:19,642 --> 01:05:23,008
- Let's try lahpet. / - Lahpet.

1493
01:05:23,008 --> 01:05:25,308
Can we get the menu please?

1494
01:05:26,775 --> 01:05:29,675
- You're virtually... / - Is this Myeong-dong?

1495
01:05:32,642 --> 01:05:34,275
There is no lahpet.

1496
01:05:34,275 --> 01:05:35,575
It's all food.

1497
01:05:36,242 --> 01:05:37,842
Look. Tea.

1498
01:05:37,842 --> 01:05:38,975
Special tea.

1499
01:05:39,408 --> 01:05:40,808
Coffee mix.

1500
01:05:41,942 --> 01:05:43,675
(Are we in a wrong place?)

1501
01:05:43,675 --> 01:05:44,908
There is no lahpet.

1502
01:05:46,142 --> 01:05:47,908
(Puzzled)

1503
01:05:47,908 --> 01:05:49,942
Lahpet is...

1504
01:05:50,575 --> 01:05:52,242
Everyone is drinking it.

1505
01:05:52,242 --> 01:05:53,908
It looks like that.

1506
01:05:55,242 --> 01:05:57,675
It looks like it's with milk.

1507
01:06:02,875 --> 01:06:05,408
(Even the table next to them is drinking it)

1508
01:06:06,142 --> 01:06:07,442
Excuse me.

1509
01:06:08,075 --> 01:06:11,908
We're looking for lahpet.

1510
01:06:12,542 --> 01:06:14,342
- Is this lahpet? / - Yeah, yeah.

1511
01:06:15,208 --> 01:06:16,808
Where is lahpet?

1512
01:06:17,575 --> 01:06:19,442
(A nice Myanmar man points to the menu)

1513
01:06:21,675 --> 01:06:22,675
Thank you.

1514
01:06:22,675 --> 01:06:24,775
Lahpet has four kinds of tea.

1515
01:06:24,775 --> 01:06:26,775
- Four tastes? / - Yes.

1516
01:06:26,775 --> 01:06:28,675
- He's so kind. / - He is.

1517
01:06:28,675 --> 01:06:32,342
- Normal. / - Very sweet. Not sweet.

1518
01:06:32,342 --> 01:06:35,075
- Bitter. / - Bitter?

1519
01:06:35,075 --> 01:06:36,775
How much is it?

1520
01:06:37,242 --> 01:06:39,275
1 for 400.

1521
01:06:39,275 --> 01:06:41,108
1 for 400.

1522
01:06:41,108 --> 01:06:43,408
So 4 cups is 1,600.

1523
01:06:44,442 --> 01:06:46,075
30 cents?

1524
01:06:46,075 --> 01:06:48,842
Just order all four.

1525
01:06:48,842 --> 01:06:49,775
That's what we did.

1526
01:06:52,242 --> 01:06:53,108
Good job.

1527
01:06:54,175 --> 01:06:55,842
Yeah, you need all four.

1528
01:06:55,842 --> 01:06:57,308
- The colors are different. / - They taste different.

1529
01:07:00,542 --> 01:07:02,275
(Normal, very sweet, not sweet, bitter)

1530
01:07:02,275 --> 01:07:05,775
- The bitter one is the darkest. / - They're different.

1531
01:07:10,408 --> 01:07:12,375
They said it tastes like black tea.

1532
01:07:12,375 --> 01:07:13,508
It's milk tea.

1533
01:07:17,808 --> 01:07:19,208
It's just like milk tea.

1534
01:07:19,208 --> 01:07:21,808
(Lahpet tastes similar to milk tea)

1535
01:07:21,808 --> 01:07:24,408
- Is it tea mixed with milk? / - Yes.

1536
01:07:24,408 --> 01:07:26,775
- It's milk and condensed milk. / - Condensed milk.

1537
01:07:27,342 --> 01:07:28,908
Is it cold or hot?

1538
01:07:28,908 --> 01:07:30,708
- It's hot. / - I see.

1539
01:07:31,108 --> 01:07:33,508
Wait, so this is the very sweet one.

1540
01:07:33,508 --> 01:07:35,408
This must be really sweet.

1541
01:07:35,408 --> 01:07:37,675
Because normal is just right.

1542
01:07:38,142 --> 01:07:39,675
(Wide eyes)

1543
01:07:39,675 --> 01:07:40,508
Drink it.

1544
01:07:41,008 --> 01:07:43,808
- This is my taste. / - The cup is so cute.

1545
01:07:47,908 --> 01:07:51,008
(She compares the normal tea and the sweet tea)

1546
01:07:52,275 --> 01:07:54,908
It's not sugar. I can taste condensed milk.

1547
01:07:54,908 --> 01:07:56,442
- Condensed milk. / - That's right.

1548
01:07:56,442 --> 01:07:57,308
It's good. It's good.

1549
01:07:57,308 --> 01:07:59,108
You need sweet food in a hot country.

1550
01:07:59,108 --> 01:08:01,542
- You're right. That gives you energy. / - Yes.

1551
01:08:02,242 --> 01:08:03,842
- Your eyes light up. / - Right.

1552
01:08:05,075 --> 01:08:06,408
This is not sweet.

1553
01:08:06,408 --> 01:08:09,042
If it's not sweet, will it be bitter?

1554
01:08:10,608 --> 01:08:11,875
Oh...

1555
01:08:13,708 --> 01:08:15,742
- It's good. / - Is it?

1556
01:08:15,742 --> 01:08:18,742
- It's like soy milk. / - It's savory.

1557
01:08:18,742 --> 01:08:19,575
It was delicious.

1558
01:08:22,242 --> 01:08:25,075
It's just with milk. It has a clean taste.

1559
01:08:27,108 --> 01:08:29,308
This is the bitter one.

1560
01:08:29,708 --> 01:08:31,608
I don't think it's that bitter.

1561
01:08:32,542 --> 01:08:33,642
It's not bitter.

1562
01:08:33,642 --> 01:08:36,875
These ones had a smooth aftertaste.

1563
01:08:36,875 --> 01:08:37,942
But this one is different.

1564
01:08:38,308 --> 01:08:40,608
(Sojin takes a sip)

1565
01:08:43,008 --> 01:08:44,142
Right?

1566
01:08:44,308 --> 01:08:45,675
Isn't it good?

1567
01:08:46,208 --> 01:08:48,642
(I feel happy)

1568
01:08:49,042 --> 01:08:50,642
This is what I like.

1569
01:08:52,542 --> 01:08:54,275
It has a strong black tea flavor.

1570
01:08:54,275 --> 01:08:57,508
It's slightly sweet with not much milk.

1571
01:08:57,508 --> 01:09:01,308
The other ones taste like they used regular tea.

1572
01:09:01,308 --> 01:09:05,208
But this one taste like they roasted the tea once more.

1573
01:09:05,208 --> 01:09:06,575
Which one do you like?

1574
01:09:06,575 --> 01:09:09,575
I like the taste of condensed milk.

1575
01:09:09,575 --> 01:09:11,408
- The very sweet one? / - I should take normal.

1576
01:09:11,408 --> 01:09:13,542
- That's the safest. / - Yes, to be safe.

1577
01:09:13,542 --> 01:09:15,642
I want sweet. The very sweet one.

1578
01:09:15,642 --> 01:09:16,942
Me too.

1579
01:09:16,942 --> 01:09:20,142
Because the weather is hot, when you feel tired...

1580
01:09:20,142 --> 01:09:21,608
Eating something sweet...

1581
01:09:21,608 --> 01:09:23,008
- Energizes you. / - You're recharged.

1582
01:09:23,008 --> 01:09:24,442
Especially if it's something hot...

1583
01:09:24,975 --> 01:09:26,875
it'll warm you up from inside.

1584
01:09:28,108 --> 01:09:29,275
In the very sweet one,

1585
01:09:29,275 --> 01:09:31,608
they put condensed milk instead of sugar.

1586
01:09:31,608 --> 01:09:34,808
It's black tea with milk.

1587
01:09:34,808 --> 01:09:35,942
It's yummy.

1588
01:09:37,008 --> 01:09:38,708
This suits my taste perfectly.

1589
01:09:39,142 --> 01:09:41,142
- Tomorrow is the Thingyan Festival. / - Yes.

1590
01:09:41,142 --> 01:09:44,442
I think it'll be fun to get water guns.

1591
01:09:44,442 --> 01:09:46,075
I don't have a water gun.

1592
01:09:46,075 --> 01:09:49,508
There is a market near here.

1593
01:09:49,508 --> 01:09:51,242
We can buy it there.

1594
01:09:51,242 --> 01:09:52,808
The New Year in Myanmar starts now.

1595
01:09:52,808 --> 01:09:54,342
The New Year in Myanmar starts now.

1596
01:09:54,342 --> 01:09:56,508
It's holiday season.

1597
01:09:56,508 --> 01:09:58,575
- Restaurants will be closed. / - Really?

1598
01:09:59,508 --> 01:10:01,208
Yes. Everything will be closed.

1599
01:10:01,208 --> 01:10:04,375
Should we ask how people spend the day?

1600
01:10:04,375 --> 01:10:06,042
Should we ask how people spend the day?

1601
01:10:06,042 --> 01:10:07,708
- You mean, during the festival? / - Yes.

1602
01:10:08,075 --> 01:10:09,042
Should we?

1603
01:10:09,042 --> 01:10:10,275
(The nice guy who helped them earlier)

1604
01:10:11,408 --> 01:10:12,908
- This... Thank you. / - Okay.

1605
01:10:14,275 --> 01:10:17,308
- How? / - What?

1606
01:10:18,675 --> 01:10:20,075
Bucket?

1607
01:10:22,208 --> 01:10:24,175
We use the guns. Water guns.

1608
01:10:24,908 --> 01:10:26,408
Water gun.

1609
01:10:26,408 --> 01:10:31,142
We're going to buy water guns.

1610
01:10:31,142 --> 01:10:34,575
Water guns aren't sold at Bogyoke Aung San Market.

1611
01:10:37,675 --> 01:10:39,775
(Bogyoke Aung San Market mostly sells jewelry)

1612
01:10:39,775 --> 01:10:41,042
They sell jewelry?

1613
01:10:41,042 --> 01:10:44,308
Where can we get water guns?

1614
01:10:44,308 --> 01:10:48,342
You can buy water guns at the 18th street or 19th street.

1615
01:10:48,808 --> 01:10:50,742
- 18 and 19? / - 18 and 19. Yes.

1616
01:10:50,742 --> 01:10:51,508
Okay. Okay.

1617
01:10:52,242 --> 01:10:55,242
You can buy a water gun you like there.

1618
01:10:55,242 --> 01:10:57,908
- And I'll buy one if there's anything I like. / - Okay.

1619
01:10:57,908 --> 01:10:59,442
Bring a big one.

1620
01:10:59,442 --> 01:11:02,075
(I'm going to get you)

1621
01:11:02,508 --> 01:11:04,808
Don't regret it if I should bring a sprinkler truck.

1622
01:11:04,808 --> 01:11:06,042
Go buy some water guns.

1623
01:11:06,042 --> 01:11:09,708
I'll go buy some pockets to keep our phones...

1624
01:11:09,708 --> 01:11:12,242
- Waterproof pack?  / - So they won't get wet.

1625
01:11:12,808 --> 01:11:13,842
Let's go.

1626
01:11:13,842 --> 01:11:14,875
Thank you.

1627
01:11:14,875 --> 01:11:16,308
Have a nice time.

1628
01:11:20,908 --> 01:11:24,108
Welcome to the real world of water.

1629
01:11:24,708 --> 01:11:27,275
(The original water festival of Myanmar)

1630
01:11:28,142 --> 01:11:30,908
(A water festival that everyone enjoys!)

1631
01:11:31,242 --> 01:11:33,008
You're all dead.

1632
01:11:33,442 --> 01:11:34,708
(Water to wash away the heat)

1633
01:11:34,708 --> 01:11:36,708
(A refreshing party time)

1634
01:11:36,708 --> 01:11:38,142
I'm going in now.

1635
01:11:38,142 --> 01:11:39,342
Look forward to it.

1636
01:11:41,775 --> 01:11:43,908
It was so fun.

1637
01:11:43,908 --> 01:11:46,208
- It was really fun. / - It really was.

1638
01:11:46,208 --> 01:11:48,775
- They have such different characters. / - Yeah.

1639
01:11:49,342 --> 01:11:53,142
When you go to Bagan, can you only go by plane?

1640
01:11:53,142 --> 01:11:55,008
You can take a bus or a train,

1641
01:11:55,008 --> 01:11:57,642
but it takes more than 8 hours.

1642
01:11:57,642 --> 01:11:59,275
Just go by plane.

1643
01:11:59,275 --> 01:12:02,008
You'd be driving on unpaved roads.

1644
01:12:02,008 --> 01:12:03,642
Yes. It'll be very hard.

1645
01:12:03,642 --> 01:12:04,842
An airplane is better.

1646
01:12:04,842 --> 01:12:07,075
Are there many flights to Bagan?

1647
01:12:07,075 --> 01:12:09,408
There's a flight every hour.

1648
01:12:09,408 --> 01:12:13,008
The flight leaves from Yangon,

1649
01:12:13,008 --> 01:12:14,908
so it departs on time.

1650
01:12:14,908 --> 01:12:16,375
But as I said...

1651
01:12:16,375 --> 01:12:18,075
- It stops by at many places... / - On the way back?

1652
01:12:18,075 --> 01:12:20,642
So it might be delayed on your way back.

1653
01:12:20,642 --> 01:12:21,975
It was actually amazing.

1654
01:12:21,975 --> 01:12:24,708
It's not over when the plane landed.

1655
01:12:24,708 --> 01:12:26,908
It just keeps taking off and landing.

1656
01:12:26,908 --> 01:12:28,908
- Is that right? / - Yes, like a bus stop.

1657
01:12:28,908 --> 01:12:29,742
Like an express bus.

1658
01:12:29,742 --> 01:12:32,775
- So the plane is rather small? / - A light aircraft?

1659
01:12:32,775 --> 01:12:34,208
Yes, it's a light aircraft.

1660
01:12:34,208 --> 01:12:37,475
I'm glad that it's not a parachute.

1661
01:12:37,475 --> 01:12:39,042
You may get off now.

1662
01:12:41,308 --> 01:12:44,042
So you wanted to go up the temple,

1663
01:12:44,042 --> 01:12:46,008
but you couldn't.

1664
01:12:46,008 --> 01:12:48,975
There's a big temple where you can see the sunrise.

1665
01:12:48,975 --> 01:12:50,608
- Right. / - We can't go up there either?

1666
01:12:50,608 --> 01:12:52,808
You can't anymore.

1667
01:12:52,808 --> 01:12:54,375
It used to be open before.

1668
01:12:54,375 --> 01:12:56,208
There was a temple called Shwesandaw Pagoda.

1669
01:12:56,208 --> 01:12:58,775
It's one of the highest temples in Bagan.

1670
01:12:58,775 --> 01:13:00,042
A lot of people went up there

1671
01:13:00,042 --> 01:13:02,542
to enjoy sunset and sunrise and take pictures.

1672
01:13:02,542 --> 01:13:04,875
But it's under restoration work now.

1673
01:13:04,875 --> 01:13:08,242
There was an earthquake. There are safety issues.

1674
01:13:08,242 --> 01:13:10,908
You can't get up there now. But once it's restored...

1675
01:13:10,908 --> 01:13:13,508
- I believe you'll be able to... / - I guess so.

1676
01:13:13,508 --> 01:13:16,142
- That's our hope. / - Alright.

1677
01:13:16,142 --> 01:13:17,942
It's time to cast a vote then.

1678
01:13:17,942 --> 01:13:19,442
Even the production staff said

1679
01:13:19,442 --> 01:13:21,008
this place is worth visiting.

1680
01:13:21,008 --> 01:13:21,708
Right, right.

1681
01:13:21,708 --> 01:13:24,008
Because it's a new tourist attraction,

1682
01:13:24,008 --> 01:13:25,875
I think it makes your trip more special.

1683
01:13:25,875 --> 01:13:27,875
Please say some final words before the vote.

1684
01:13:27,875 --> 01:13:32,142
It hasn't been so long since Myanmar opened up.

1685
01:13:32,142 --> 01:13:34,775
So the old is well preserved in the country.

1686
01:13:34,775 --> 01:13:37,075
When you travel to Southeast Asian countries,

1687
01:13:37,075 --> 01:13:40,108
you usually think about swimming pools.

1688
01:13:40,108 --> 01:13:41,742
So I'd like to recommend the

1689
01:13:41,742 --> 01:13:43,542
new attractions of Myanmar.

1690
01:13:43,542 --> 01:13:44,675
That's nice.

1691
01:13:44,675 --> 01:13:47,542
Will you go to Myanmar according to

1692
01:13:47,542 --> 01:13:51,142
Firefighting Tour's itinerary? Please vote.

1693
01:13:51,708 --> 01:13:54,842
(Sojin and Ayoung designed a trip to Myanmar)

1694
01:13:55,108 --> 01:13:58,108
(What will the judges choose?)

1695
01:13:58,442 --> 01:14:00,842
The two women went on a trip to Myanmar.

1696
01:14:00,842 --> 01:14:03,775
Then how would the two men's trip to Thailand be?

1697
01:14:03,775 --> 01:14:07,108
Please look forward to our next episode.

1698
01:14:07,108 --> 01:14:07,908
Thank you.

1699
01:14:07,908 --> 01:14:09,475
Thank you.

1700
01:14:12,542 --> 01:14:13,608
(Next week)

1701
01:14:13,742 --> 01:14:16,008
Just relax and enjoy.

1702
01:14:16,008 --> 01:14:17,775
- It's magnificent, right? / - Wow.

1703
01:14:18,542 --> 01:14:19,575
That looks so scary.

1704
01:14:19,575 --> 01:14:21,142
This is amazing.

1705
01:14:21,142 --> 01:14:21,908
So pretty.

1706
01:14:21,908 --> 01:14:24,675
It's like a house from my childhood dreams.

1707
01:14:24,675 --> 01:14:27,108
- It's like a fairy tale. / - It's like my own hideout.

1708
01:14:27,108 --> 01:14:29,908
We can't find an open space like this in Seoul.

1709
01:14:29,908 --> 01:14:32,142
Make the trip enjoyable.

1710
01:14:32,575 --> 01:14:33,908
This is so nice.

1711
01:14:35,075 --> 01:14:38,542
(Returning to the innocence of childhood)

1712
01:14:40,042 --> 01:14:41,842
(Excited vs. Relaxed)

1713
01:14:41,842 --> 01:14:44,075
It'll be fun. You can look forward to it.

1714
01:14:44,908 --> 01:14:46,175
I'm already satisfied.

1715
01:14:46,175 --> 01:14:47,442
5, 6, 7, 8.

1716
01:14:47,442 --> 01:14:49,908
Hakyeon, Hongbin, do it, do it, yeah!

1717
01:14:53,108 --> 01:14:55,963
(Battle Trip)

1718
01:14:55,963 --> 01:15:13,474
("Love,ing" by Ben)
