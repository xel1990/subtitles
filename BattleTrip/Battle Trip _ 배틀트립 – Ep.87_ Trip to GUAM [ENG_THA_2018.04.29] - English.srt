Bravo!

7
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:20,676
This is amazing.

8
00:00:20,676 --> 00:00:22,410
I've never felt like this before.

9
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:24,476
It feels like I'm in a movie.

10
00:00:24,476 --> 00:00:28,343
(Battle Trip is to see)

11
00:00:28,343 --> 00:00:29,843
It was the most intense moment.

12
00:00:29,843 --> 00:00:30,976
Good, good.

13
00:00:30,976 --> 00:00:41,810

14
00:00:42,343 --> 00:00:43,710
Oh, my God.

00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:44,776
It's huge.

17
00:00:56,510 --> 00:00:57,643
It's so good.

18
00:00:57,643 --> 00:00:58,776
I've never had anything like this before.

19
00:00:58,776 --> 00:01:03,510
(Battle Trip's 2-year anniversary)

20
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:05,476
(The hosts have prepared a special episode)

21
00:01:06,910 --> 00:01:07,643
You startled me.

22
00:01:07,643 --> 00:01:08,643
You startled me!

23
00:01:11,076 --> 00:01:12,810
Geez! Hey! What is this?

24
00:01:13,776 --> 00:01:15,343
I have a weak heart.

25
00:01:15,343 --> 00:01:16,243
That's because you're old.

26
00:01:16,243 --> 00:01:17,643
What is this for?

27
00:01:17,643 --> 00:01:18,576
It's our 2nd-year anniversary.

28
00:01:20,176 --> 00:01:21,043
Now it feels real, huh?

29
00:01:21,043 --> 00:01:24,043
That is quite fascinating.

30
00:01:24,043 --> 00:01:24,843
What is?

31
00:01:24,843 --> 00:01:26,743
I get surprised when I see us like this.

32
00:01:27,410 --> 00:01:29,210
Don't people usually sit like this

33
00:01:29,210 --> 00:01:31,443
for announcements or if they did something wrong?

34
00:01:32,143 --> 00:01:33,810
Or announcing a wedding.

35
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:34,610
That's right.

36
00:01:35,876 --> 00:01:36,676
What?

37
00:01:36,676 --> 00:01:38,143
What are we doing?

38
00:01:38,143 --> 00:01:40,343
- What is this? / - This is how it's done.

39
00:01:40,343 --> 00:01:41,076
There we go.

40
00:01:41,076 --> 00:01:42,210
Seriously...

41
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:44,176
- Congratulations on 2 years. / - Congratulations.

42
00:01:44,976 --> 00:01:47,976
(Congratulations on 2 years Battle Trip)

43
00:01:47,976 --> 00:01:49,276
Time sure goes fast.

44
00:01:49,276 --> 00:01:50,110
It goes really fast.

45
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:53,243
Shouldn't we go somewhere for 2 years...

46
00:01:53,243 --> 00:01:55,376
Over the past 2 years,

47
00:01:55,376 --> 00:01:59,676
we were asked the most about family trips.

48
00:02:00,843 --> 00:02:02,676
- Family... / - If it's a family trip...

49
00:02:02,676 --> 00:02:04,476
But I live alone.

50
00:02:04,476 --> 00:02:06,543
- A family trip... / - Sikyung and I...

51
00:02:06,543 --> 00:02:08,643
- Dad, mom... / - Family.

52
00:02:08,643 --> 00:02:11,676
- The old bachelor. / - Uncle.

53
00:02:11,676 --> 00:02:13,576
It's kind of a stretch for me to be the son, right?

54
00:02:13,576 --> 00:02:15,576
- It's a little hard. / - You're too big to be our son.

55
00:02:15,576 --> 00:02:17,510
- You're too big to be our son. / - Then...

56
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:18,743
- You're right. / - This is good.

57
00:02:18,743 --> 00:02:20,776
We'll go on a trip like this.

58
00:02:20,776 --> 00:02:23,776
Korean families go on a trip to Guam the most.

59
00:02:25,676 --> 00:02:27,210
- Oh, Guam. / - I went there 3 months ago.

60
00:02:28,543 --> 00:02:29,943
- For me... / - How many times have you been there?

61
00:02:29,943 --> 00:02:30,876
6 times.

62
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:34,010
- To be honest... / - You're a Guam native.

63
00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:36,843
This means you're a native.

64
00:02:36,843 --> 00:02:37,676
- Right. / - I even...

65
00:02:38,676 --> 00:02:40,876
Have a family photo from Guam.

66
00:02:43,210 --> 00:02:44,510
It was so good then.

67
00:02:44,510 --> 00:02:45,743
Goodness.

68
00:02:45,743 --> 00:02:47,343
You look so happy.

69
00:02:48,376 --> 00:02:49,610
It was good then.

70
00:02:49,610 --> 00:02:51,410
Seriously.

71
00:02:51,410 --> 00:02:52,710
Let me tell you one thing...

72
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:53,676
There's an ice cream shop here.

73
00:02:53,676 --> 00:02:55,710
I know how it tastes so I want to eat it so bad.

74
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:57,010
They'd like this place too.

75
00:02:58,443 --> 00:02:59,176
Just go.

78
00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:07,810
Blue is for women.

79
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:09,343
Men aren't supposed to drive.

80
00:03:10,043 --> 00:03:10,943
With her...

81
00:03:14,576 --> 00:03:15,910
Forget all this.

82
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:16,710
Darn it.

83
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:18,543

90

Let's be happy for a long time.

91

(We'll start their family story right now)

92
00:03:50,176 --> 00:03:51,943
The thing that parents like the most

93
00:03:51,943 --> 00:03:54,343
is having the hotel close to the airport.

94
00:03:54,343 --> 00:03:56,343
Guam is the optimal location for that.

95
00:03:56,343 --> 00:03:57,110
- Right. / - How long does it take?

96
00:03:57,110 --> 00:03:57,976
15 minutes.

97
00:03:58,610 --> 00:04:00,076
The kids can use the pool as soon as you get there?

98
00:04:00,076 --> 00:04:00,943
- That's right. / - Right.

99
00:04:00,943 --> 00:04:02,810
Also, the weather's good.

100
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:04,643
You don't have to move around a lot.

101
00:04:04,643 --> 00:04:07,010
- For me... / - You can plan everything then.

102
00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:08,543
No, I shouldn't plan everything.

103
00:04:08,543 --> 00:04:09,976
- Why not? / - Since it's a family concept.

104
00:04:09,976 --> 00:04:12,443
- Should we divide the work? / - Yeah.

105
00:04:12,443 --> 00:04:13,810
I'll plan the mornings.

106
00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:15,943
Let's divide it into morning, afternoon, evening.

107
00:04:15,943 --> 00:04:16,843
Yeah?

108
00:04:16,843 --> 00:04:18,276
Can't we sleep in the morning?

109
00:04:18,276 --> 00:04:19,243
What?

110
00:04:21,443 --> 00:04:23,343
You can never sleep in on a family trip.

111
00:04:23,343 --> 00:04:24,110
What are you on about?

112
00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:25,010
You can't sleep in the morning.

113
00:04:25,010 --> 00:04:26,743
You have to be diligent on trips.

114
00:04:26,743 --> 00:04:28,476
Then I'll take care of the evenings.

115
00:04:28,476 --> 00:04:29,976
Sikyung, you take care of the afternoons.

116
00:04:29,976 --> 00:04:31,143
- Okay. / - Okay?

117
00:04:31,143 --> 00:04:32,610
- Fine, okay then... / - Yeah.

118

Things to do in the morning and to eat.

120

121
00:04:36,976 --> 00:04:38,243
- You decide what you want to do. / - Just decide.

122
00:04:38,243 --> 00:04:39,476
- Just pick one thing. / - For me...

123
00:04:39,476 --> 00:04:40,810
I can think of so many things.

124
00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:41,476
In the evening?

125
00:04:41,476 --> 00:04:42,443
Too much.

126
00:04:42,443 --> 00:04:43,576
Let's enjoy our trip.

127
00:04:43,576 --> 00:04:44,343
Yes.

128
00:04:44,343 --> 00:04:45,576
I'm so...

129
00:04:45,576 --> 00:04:47,176
Come on, Sikyung. Join us.

130
00:04:47,176 --> 00:04:48,443
Let's have a good trip.

131
00:04:48,443 --> 00:04:49,676
Let's go to Guam.

132
00:04:49,676 --> 00:04:52,076
This looks like a big version of "Gangnam Style."

133
00:04:52,076 --> 00:04:52,843
Try it.

134
00:04:58,243 --> 00:04:59,576
This will be fun with just us three.

135
00:05:01,043 --> 00:05:03,610
Good restaurants in Guam...

136
00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:06,810
I'm going to eat a huge breakfast no matter what.

137
00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:09,443
This looks good.

138
00:05:12,376 --> 00:05:13,043
Yes, Sook?

139
00:05:13,043 --> 00:05:14,310
Are you busy, Seyoon?

140
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:15,576
What time do you finish?

141
00:05:16,876 --> 00:05:18,476
The radio?

142
00:05:18,476 --> 00:05:19,576
I finish around 4.

143
00:05:19,576 --> 00:05:21,243
- You finish at 4? / - Yeah.

144
00:05:22,043 --> 00:05:23,676
Then I'll wait for you.

Hello.

146
00:05:24,976 --> 00:05:26,410
To Guam.

147

- Guam. / - Guam expert.

148
00:05:27,943 --> 00:05:29,943
I'm Guam expert, Moon Seyoon.

149
00:05:31,143 --> 00:05:32,343
I'll record this.

150
00:05:32,343 --> 00:05:33,410
- Do you have to record it? / - Yes.

151
00:05:33,410 --> 00:05:35,143
Who do you work for?

152
00:05:35,143 --> 00:05:37,443
I don't want to miss out on anything.

153
00:05:37,443 --> 00:05:38,143
Okay, okay.

154
00:05:39,176 --> 00:05:40,743
You know I love Korean food, right?

155
00:05:42,876 --> 00:05:44,976
Why? I'm going to eat Guam food.

156

Restaurant "D."

157

Restaurant "J."

158
00:05:47,776 --> 00:05:49,043
These names...

159
00:05:49,043 --> 00:05:49,710
And...

160
00:05:49,710 --> 00:05:50,810
The course is good.

161
00:05:50,810 --> 00:05:51,410
At night.

162
00:05:51,410 --> 00:05:52,776
- This is the course I like. / - At night.

163

"S" chicken.

165
00:05:55,076 --> 00:05:56,110
At night...

166
00:05:56,110 --> 00:05:57,943
- "S"... / - "S" chicken.

167
00:05:57,943 --> 00:05:59,210
"S" chicken.

168
00:05:59,910 --> 00:06:00,910
They have good spicy chicken.

169
00:06:01,876 --> 00:06:02,843
Korea has the best chicken.

170
00:06:03,543 --> 00:06:05,610
It tastes like Korean chicken.

171
00:06:07,843 --> 00:06:08,976
Hafa adai.

172
00:06:08,976 --> 00:06:09,676
What is that?

173
00:06:09,676 --> 00:06:10,643

- Saying hafa adai. / - Hafa adai.

179
00:06:17,076 --> 00:06:18,676
You can't just walk past them.

180

Hafa adai.

181
00:06:19,443 --> 00:06:21,310

186
00:06:29,476 --> 00:06:32,410
Sinyeong, Sinyeong, Kim Sinyeong.

187
00:06:32,410 --> 00:06:34,076
What should I do in Guam?

188
00:06:34,976 --> 00:06:36,943
First, you have to go clubbing in Guam.

189
00:06:41,076 --> 00:06:43,176
They have those adult shows as well.

190
00:06:44,943 --> 00:06:46,810
You're on camera right now. I'm recording.

191
00:06:46,810 --> 00:06:48,443
Oops, I'm sorry.

192
00:06:49,176 --> 00:06:50,310
What about doing busking?

193
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:51,510
Busking?

194
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:52,543
- What? / - Busking.

195
00:06:52,543 --> 00:06:54,910
"Say Goodbye" in an acoustic version.

196
00:06:54,910 --> 00:06:55,810
It's been a while.

197
00:06:58,210 --> 00:07:00,110
As you can see, I have no help.

198
00:07:00,843 --> 00:07:03,810
I'll just plan it myself.

199
00:07:03,810 --> 00:07:04,743
Go, go.

200
00:07:05,543 --> 00:07:06,976
Seoeon, Seojun.

201
00:07:06,976 --> 00:07:08,210
Why are you packing?

202
00:07:08,210 --> 00:07:10,310
I'm going to Guam tomorrow.

203
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:11,310
Why?

204
00:07:11,310 --> 00:07:13,276
Babies can't go.

205
00:07:13,276 --> 00:07:14,276
Just me...

206
00:07:14,276 --> 00:07:15,443
No...

207
00:07:15,443 --> 00:07:16,210
Huh?

208
00:07:17,543 --> 00:07:18,810
Did I wear sunglasses?

209
00:07:18,810 --> 00:07:20,043
Take me.

210
00:07:20,876 --> 00:07:23,276
How am I going to leave?

211
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:24,810
You can't go.

212
00:07:24,810 --> 00:07:26,376
Why not? It's for work...

213
00:07:26,376 --> 00:07:28,910
If we can't go, you can't go.

214
00:07:28,910 --> 00:07:30,376
I'm going for work.

215
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:33,776
You can't go.

216
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:35,543
You can't go.

217
00:07:36,276 --> 00:07:38,010
You can't go.

218
00:07:39,576 --> 00:07:41,110
Can't go.

219
00:07:41,410 --> 00:07:47,843
(The day of the 2-year-anniversary trip)

220
00:07:49,576 --> 00:07:54,410
(Who's the first to arrive at the airport?)

221
00:07:55,176 --> 00:07:56,143
Isn't anyone here yet?

222
00:07:58,010 --> 00:07:58,943
Isn't anyone here yet?

223
00:08:00,476 --> 00:08:01,443
Isn't anyone here yet?

224
00:08:03,743 --> 00:08:06,910
(Awkward)

225
00:08:08,310 --> 00:08:11,043
I can't remember the last time...

226
00:08:12,343 --> 00:08:13,443
I left on a trip alone.

227
00:08:14,476 --> 00:08:16,176
You're confident about Guam, right?

228
00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:18,976
I'm a Guam native.

229
00:08:19,843 --> 00:08:20,843
I'm a native.

230
00:08:22,543 --> 00:08:24,076
I'm friends with the owner of the shooting range.

231
00:08:26,010 --> 00:08:27,410
I'm friends with Chamorro people.

232
00:08:29,210 --> 00:08:31,076
It's the best place for a family trip.

233
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:34,076
The airport

234
00:08:34,076 --> 00:08:35,443
is close to the downtown area.

235
00:08:35,443 --> 00:08:36,676
It's safe.

236
00:08:39,243 --> 00:08:39,810
I'm in trouble.

237
00:08:40,876 --> 00:08:44,010
(He receives a video call from home)

238
00:08:44,676 --> 00:08:46,576
Seojun, I'll be back real soon.

239
00:08:46,576 --> 00:08:47,776
No!

240
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:52,676
I'll be back soon.

241
00:08:53,543 --> 00:08:54,876
Don't go.

242
00:08:54,876 --> 00:08:56,010
Then...

243
00:08:56,010 --> 00:08:58,676
Is it because I'm leaving or I'm going to Guam?

244
00:08:58,676 --> 00:09:00,543
Don't go.

245
00:09:00,543 --> 00:09:02,143
You don't want me to go anywhere?

246
00:09:04,243 --> 00:09:06,910
Dad, don't go.

247
00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:10,510
I'll call you when I'm there.

248
00:09:11,543 --> 00:09:12,943
No.

249
00:09:15,276 --> 00:09:16,910
No.

250
00:09:20,276 --> 00:09:23,543
(Who's arrived at the airport this time?)

251
00:09:24,976 --> 00:09:26,743
It's been so long since I've been on an overseas trip.

252
00:09:28,243 --> 00:09:29,843
It's nice to see you.

253
00:09:29,843 --> 00:09:31,110
Oh, my.

254
00:09:31,843 --> 00:09:33,376
This is amazing.

255
00:09:33,376 --> 00:09:35,843
We sent people to enjoy like this for the past 2 years.

256
00:09:35,843 --> 00:09:37,443
We made them happy.

257
00:09:38,876 --> 00:09:40,543
Hello.

258
00:09:40,543 --> 00:09:41,510
- Hello. / - Oh, my.

259
00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:42,776
- Hello. / - Hello.

260
00:09:42,776 --> 00:09:43,876
Hello.

261
00:09:46,043 --> 00:09:46,843
It's Sook.

262
00:09:48,943 --> 00:09:50,076
(Ho)

263
00:09:50,076 --> 00:09:51,943
(Hahaha)

264
00:09:52,410 --> 00:09:53,610
Hurry it up.

265
00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:55,176
Yo!

266
00:09:55,176 --> 00:09:56,576
Hey, Hwijae. Yo!

267
00:09:56,576 --> 00:09:58,043
Hurry it up.

268
00:09:58,043 --> 00:09:59,643
So we're actually leaving.

269
00:09:59,643 --> 00:10:02,376
Seyoon recently went to Guam.

270
00:10:02,376 --> 00:10:03,643
I know.

271
00:10:03,643 --> 00:10:04,743
So...

272
00:10:04,743 --> 00:10:05,910
But Seyoon...

273
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:07,843
Only told me about Korean restaurants.

274
00:10:07,843 --> 00:10:10,576
(No help, just like Sinyeong)

275
00:10:12,143 --> 00:10:13,676
Did you bring a lot of money?

276
00:10:13,676 --> 00:10:14,776
No.

277
00:10:14,776 --> 00:10:15,643
Why?

278
00:10:15,643 --> 00:10:17,010
I have my credit card.

279
00:10:17,676 --> 00:10:19,176
You need cash though.

280
00:10:19,176 --> 00:10:20,143
How much did you bring?

281
00:10:21,243 --> 00:10:22,310
About $100.

282
00:10:25,743 --> 00:10:27,610
Lend me some money. I mean it.

283
00:10:27,610 --> 00:10:28,776
Just lend me $1,000.

284
00:10:28,776 --> 00:10:30,043
I don't have $1,000.

285
00:10:31,476 --> 00:10:32,443
Sikyung is here.

286
00:10:35,310 --> 00:10:37,176
Shouldn't I wear sunglasses since I'm going on a trip?

287
00:10:38,743 --> 00:10:41,676
(Sung Sikyung now looks cool)

288
00:10:41,676 --> 00:10:44,576
Incheon International Airport gives

289
00:10:44,576 --> 00:10:45,976
you this sense of excitement.

290
00:10:48,643 --> 00:10:49,843
He visited the salon.

291
00:10:50,510 --> 00:10:52,643
Sikyung looks so cool. It's his airport look.

292
00:10:52,643 --> 00:10:54,276
He's the only one looking cool.

293
00:10:54,276 --> 00:10:55,210
Airport fashion.

294
00:10:55,210 --> 00:10:56,776
- Look at Sikyung. / - Why are you doing this alone?

295
00:10:56,776 --> 00:10:57,543
Sikyung.

296
00:10:57,543 --> 00:10:58,643
You know these aren't mine, right?

297
00:10:58,643 --> 00:10:59,743
- I know. / - These aren't your clothes?

298
00:10:59,743 --> 00:11:00,876
- No. / - I knew it.

299
00:11:00,876 --> 00:11:03,043
- Sikyung, did you bring some money? / - This...

300
00:11:03,043 --> 00:11:04,676
- No. / - Talk about money later!

301
00:11:04,676 --> 00:11:05,776
Don't they accept credit cards?

302
00:11:05,776 --> 00:11:07,410
I want to exchange some money.

303
00:11:10,776 --> 00:11:11,876
Did you bring your passports?

304
00:11:12,376 --> 00:11:13,343
- Passports. / - Wait a minute.

305
00:11:13,343 --> 00:11:13,976
I have my passport.

306
00:11:13,976 --> 00:11:15,610
My passport was the last thing I packed.

307
00:11:15,610 --> 00:11:16,543
I almost messed up bad.

308
00:11:17,043 --> 00:11:19,276
Do you know about this?

309
00:11:19,276 --> 00:11:22,543
They said I had to show my ears and forehead.

310
00:11:22,543 --> 00:11:23,476
But now it's changed.

311
00:11:23,476 --> 00:11:24,310
It doesn't matter now.

312
00:11:24,310 --> 00:11:25,276
Also...

313
00:11:26,643 --> 00:11:28,643
- I've ordered our meals already. / - What?

314
00:11:28,643 --> 00:11:30,343
You have to order in advance, right?

315
00:11:30,343 --> 00:11:31,410
What did you order for me?

316
00:11:32,043 --> 00:11:33,310
I ordered a variety.

317
00:11:33,310 --> 00:11:34,443
- So we can share. / - Okay then.

318
00:11:35,010 --> 00:11:35,976
Let's board the plane now.

319
00:11:35,976 --> 00:11:37,643
- Let's go. / - Let's go.

320
00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:40,276
Hey, I can use my credit card in Guam, right?

321
00:11:40,276 --> 00:11:41,010
Of course.

322
00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:42,810
I don't need cash, right?

323
00:11:42,810 --> 00:11:44,043
They accept all cards there.

324
00:11:44,043 --> 00:11:45,743
But shouldn't we bring at least $100 in cash?

325
00:11:46,376 --> 00:11:47,510
$100?

326
00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:48,810
I have $100.

327
00:11:48,810 --> 00:11:52,643
(Off to Guam)

328
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:55,376
- Here are your in-flight meals. / - Thank you.

329
00:11:55,376 --> 00:11:56,310
I ordered them in advance.

330
00:11:57,076 --> 00:11:58,143
Excuse me.

331
00:11:58,143 --> 00:11:59,143
I have your meal...

332
00:11:59,143 --> 00:12:00,043
Yes, the healthy meal.

333
00:12:00,843 --> 00:12:02,210
For Sook, who's on a diet.

334
00:12:02,976 --> 00:12:05,110
I like that they gave me the right spoon for my size.

335
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:08,343
That's for Seoeon.

336
00:12:09,776 --> 00:12:11,410
This is where the trip begins.

337
00:12:12,076 --> 00:12:12,843
To be honest...

338
00:12:12,843 --> 00:12:14,510
I wasn't going to say this because

339
00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:15,776
it'll make me look old.

340
00:12:15,776 --> 00:12:17,176
But the world has become so advanced.

341
00:12:19,743 --> 00:12:20,976
This is so good.

342
00:12:20,976 --> 00:12:22,043
This is the good restaurant.

343
00:12:23,076 --> 00:12:23,976
- Sook. / - Yeah?

344
00:12:24,843 --> 00:12:25,643
This is good.

345
00:12:27,043 --> 00:12:29,510
I think I can eat this for every meal.

346
00:12:32,610 --> 00:12:33,976
So we're actually going.

347
00:12:33,976 --> 00:12:34,943
Happy trip.

348
00:12:39,543 --> 00:12:40,476
I'm so happy.

349
00:12:44,243 --> 00:12:45,210
As soon as we arrive...

350
00:12:45,210 --> 00:12:46,276
- We sleep. / - We must sleep.

351
00:12:46,276 --> 00:12:48,876
- Let's sleep. I'll wake you up. / - Okay.

352
00:12:48,876 --> 00:12:50,976
I'll wake you up

353
00:12:50,976 --> 00:12:53,010
then I'll sort out where we're going.

354
00:12:54,810 --> 00:12:56,343
I should've brought my tablet.

355
00:12:57,043 --> 00:12:58,943
(See you in Guam)

356
00:12:59,410 --> 00:13:01,010
(Incheon International Airport)

357
00:13:01,010 --> 00:13:02,943
(Guam International Airport, 4 hours and 25 minutes)

358
00:13:04,143 --> 00:13:07,610
(Guam)

359
00:13:07,743 --> 00:13:10,976
(Guam is Korea's favorite family trip destination)

360
00:13:10,976 --> 00:13:14,276
(Everywhere you look)

361
00:13:14,976 --> 00:13:16,210
They're so cute.

362
00:13:19,043 --> 00:13:20,976
(You can have fun everywhere)

363
00:13:20,976 --> 00:13:24,776
(So many activities to do)

364
00:13:28,243 --> 00:13:31,543
(A paradise where you can do everything)

365
00:13:31,776 --> 00:13:34,343
(We invite you to this magical island)

366
00:13:34,543 --> 00:13:39,410
(Guam)

367
00:13:40,176 --> 00:13:44,276
(First day in Guam)

368
00:13:45,543 --> 00:13:48,010
(The hosts' rooms)

369
00:13:48,010 --> 00:13:50,843
(Sikyung, Sook, Hwijae)

370
00:13:50,843 --> 00:13:52,543
(Hwijae's room)

371
00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:56,043
(Hwijae's room is empty)

372
00:13:56,510 --> 00:13:59,010
(Where did he go this early in the morning?)

373
00:14:00,210 --> 00:14:06,043
(Hwijae's swimming in the pool)

374
00:14:07,176 --> 00:14:09,976
- Show us your swimming skills. / - I agree.

375
00:14:09,976 --> 00:14:12,376
- We've only heard rumors about it. / - Right.

376
00:14:12,376 --> 00:14:16,043
You haven't done anything so far.

377
00:14:16,976 --> 00:14:18,343
You didn't even get to see the dolphins.

378
00:14:18,343 --> 00:14:19,843
You couldn't even stand up on the surfing board.

379
00:14:19,843 --> 00:14:21,843
He looked so pitiful when he went surfing.

380
00:14:23,210 --> 00:14:26,976
(He's showing off his swimming from the morning)

381
00:14:27,776 --> 00:14:30,076
(All alone in this pool)

382
00:14:30,410 --> 00:14:35,276
(Sook, can you see how good I am?)

383
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:40,043
(He swam for a while all by himself)

384
00:14:41,310 --> 00:14:44,610
(Meanwhile, what about Sikyung the youngest?)

385
00:14:46,876 --> 00:14:48,810
(Ta-da)

386
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:52,043
(Staring the morning with news in English)

387
00:14:52,043 --> 00:14:56,076
(Sikyung is an intelligent, healthy male)

388
00:14:57,543 --> 00:15:01,076
(So hot)

389
00:15:03,476 --> 00:15:05,343
Should I wake them up?

390
00:15:08,176 --> 00:15:09,976
Such sleepyheads.

391
00:15:12,710 --> 00:15:13,376
It's here.

392
00:15:14,576 --> 00:15:16,410
(Silent)

393
00:15:17,810 --> 00:15:18,576
Is he not in?

394
00:15:19,643 --> 00:15:21,843
(Sikyung's room)

395
00:15:22,943 --> 00:15:23,810
Sikyung.

396
00:15:26,510 --> 00:15:27,910
Hwijae.

397
00:15:28,843 --> 00:15:30,176
Sikyung.

398
00:15:31,876 --> 00:15:35,410
(Sook decides to look for them)

399
00:15:35,410 --> 00:15:36,576
- Oh! / - Hi.

400
00:15:36,576 --> 00:15:37,643
My goodness.

401
00:15:38,276 --> 00:15:39,676
What's going on?

402
00:15:39,676 --> 00:15:41,110
I thought it was my apartment.

403
00:15:42,676 --> 00:15:43,510
Hello.

404
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:44,976
- Hello. / - Hello.

405
00:15:44,976 --> 00:15:46,710
Hello.

406
00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:47,910
Hello.

407
00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:50,376
Such a friendly atmosphere.

408
00:15:50,843 --> 00:15:52,476
Where is Sikyung?

409
00:15:52,943 --> 00:15:53,776
And Hwijae?

410
00:16:01,876 --> 00:16:06,310
(Spots a familiar figure 30 minutes before their trip)

411
00:16:07,043 --> 00:16:08,543
Hold on. Is that Sikyung?

412
00:16:10,410 --> 00:16:12,543
(Looking in)

413
00:16:19,710 --> 00:16:22,676
(Staring)

414
00:16:24,210 --> 00:16:25,310
Hey.

415
00:16:26,176 --> 00:16:27,476
How long have you been working out?

416
00:16:27,476 --> 00:16:29,876
It's been 37 minutes.

417
00:16:29,876 --> 00:16:31,543
37 minutes?

418
00:16:31,543 --> 00:16:32,743
You'll end up dying if you do this.

419
00:16:32,743 --> 00:16:33,576
No.

420
00:16:33,576 --> 00:16:35,143
I'm preparing myself to eat a lot.

421
00:16:38,476 --> 00:16:39,210
What's going on?

422
00:16:39,210 --> 00:16:43,943
(Sikyung did eat a lot)

423
00:16:44,276 --> 00:16:46,576
(It's a good thing I worked out today)

424
00:16:46,576 --> 00:16:48,043
Amazing.

425
00:16:48,043 --> 00:16:49,110
Look at all this sweat.

426
00:16:50,076 --> 00:16:51,076
What's up with your shirt?

427
00:16:52,143 --> 00:16:53,776
You need to wear this too.

428
00:16:53,776 --> 00:16:55,310
- What? / - You have to wear one too.

429
00:16:55,943 --> 00:16:58,176
To be honest, we don't need to pack anything.

430
00:16:58,943 --> 00:17:00,610
When they wear these shirts...

431
00:17:01,610 --> 00:17:02,810
It will lift their spirits.

432
00:17:03,343 --> 00:17:05,476
(Ta-da)

433
00:17:05,476 --> 00:17:06,910
Don't you think about leaving the group.

434
00:17:06,910 --> 00:17:08,510
We'll hang out together.

435
00:17:08,510 --> 00:17:09,543
They look nice.

436
00:17:11,376 --> 00:17:12,243
They look nice.

437
00:17:13,843 --> 00:17:14,943
Smiling angel.

438
00:17:16,310 --> 00:17:17,376
Smiling angel.

439
00:17:22,543 --> 00:17:23,743
Can I use this to wipe my sweat and throw it out?

440
00:17:23,743 --> 00:17:24,843
What are you saying?

441
00:17:24,843 --> 00:17:25,910
You have to wear it.

442
00:17:25,910 --> 00:17:27,510
Tell me the time and I'll be ready by then.

443
00:17:27,510 --> 00:17:28,543
9 a.m.

444
00:17:28,543 --> 00:17:30,710
We have to go have breakfast.

445
00:17:30,710 --> 00:17:32,643
- Oh, right. / - Yeah.

446
00:17:32,643 --> 00:17:34,410
We must be there by 10:30 a.m.

447
00:17:34,410 --> 00:17:35,310
We have to eat breakfast...

448
00:17:35,310 --> 00:17:36,276
Hurry. Run.

449
00:17:36,276 --> 00:17:37,343
You can do it.

450
00:17:37,343 --> 00:17:38,810
Don't wipe your sweat with this.

451
00:17:38,810 --> 00:17:40,010
- Okay. / - Good.

452
00:17:40,576 --> 00:17:41,510
He must be crazy.

453
00:17:44,076 --> 00:17:47,676
(Sikyung ran for a long while to eat breakfast)

454
00:17:49,743 --> 00:17:52,110
- Start. / - Start.

455
00:17:52,110 --> 00:17:53,210
The world is your school.

456
00:17:53,210 --> 00:17:54,510
Life is a journey.

457
00:17:54,510 --> 00:17:56,210
Battle...

458
00:17:56,210 --> 00:17:57,276
Geez.

459
00:17:57,276 --> 00:17:57,976
Trip!

460
00:18:00,210 --> 00:18:02,510
We've arrived in Guam!

461
00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:03,710
What a day.

462
00:18:03,710 --> 00:18:04,910
I don't believe it.

463
00:18:04,910 --> 00:18:06,510
I feel such a sense of relief.

464
00:18:06,510 --> 00:18:07,210
You're right.

465
00:18:07,210 --> 00:18:09,976
When you look at Korean family trips...

466
00:18:09,976 --> 00:18:11,510
This is the most popular location.

467
00:18:11,510 --> 00:18:12,710
- Guam. / - We've arrived in Guam.

468
00:18:12,710 --> 00:18:14,410
You're a father.

469
00:18:14,410 --> 00:18:15,343
Do you agree with that?

470
00:18:15,343 --> 00:18:16,810
It's even beyond that.

471
00:18:16,810 --> 00:18:20,710
Last year, we stayed here for a week.

472
00:18:20,710 --> 00:18:25,343
On the way to the airport, Seojun cried so much.

473
00:18:25,343 --> 00:18:26,210
- Why? / - Because he didn't want to leave?

474
00:18:26,210 --> 00:18:27,176
Looking at the stars.

475
00:18:27,176 --> 00:18:28,310
Saying he wants to stay?

476
00:18:28,310 --> 00:18:29,010
He wanted to stay here.

477
00:18:29,010 --> 00:18:30,676
As you can see,

478
00:18:30,676 --> 00:18:32,876
most of the people watching us here are Korean.

479
00:18:32,876 --> 00:18:33,876
There are no inconveniences.

480
00:18:33,876 --> 00:18:34,910
There are Korean employees.

481
00:18:34,910 --> 00:18:36,210
You can ask if you don't know.

482
00:18:36,210 --> 00:18:37,376
Everything is in Korean.

483
00:18:37,376 --> 00:18:39,676
Today, Guam is no. 1 on

484
00:18:39,676 --> 00:18:40,776
the favorite family trip destinations list.

485
00:18:40,776 --> 00:18:41,443
- No. 1. / - Right.

486
00:18:41,443 --> 00:18:42,410
And we're a family too.

487
00:18:42,410 --> 00:18:43,843
- Our 2nd anniversary. / - That's why...

488
00:18:43,843 --> 00:18:45,443
- I prepared these shirts. Dad. / - Dad.

489
00:18:45,443 --> 00:18:46,143
- Mom. / - Mom.

490
00:18:46,143 --> 00:18:47,710
- Old bachelor son. / - Uncle.

491
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:48,810
What are we doing today?

492
00:18:48,810 --> 00:18:50,210
- Who's first? / - Today, I...

493
00:18:51,576 --> 00:18:52,743
I painted the picture.

494
00:18:52,743 --> 00:18:54,243
- Since you're an artist? / - Yes.

495
00:18:54,243 --> 00:18:56,443
- I've planned the day... / - Where do you buy this?

496
00:18:56,443 --> 00:18:58,076
With this...

497
00:18:58,076 --> 00:19:00,010
There's a shop that only fashion people know.

498
00:19:00,010 --> 00:19:02,143
They don't sell these just anywhere.

499
00:19:02,143 --> 00:19:03,510
You have to deal privately.

500
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:04,643
There are such channels.

501
00:19:04,643 --> 00:19:06,810
- Okay. / - I painted the picture today.

502
00:19:06,810 --> 00:19:07,843
Morning.

503
00:19:07,843 --> 00:19:08,876
Before noon.

504
00:19:08,876 --> 00:19:10,343
I'm in charge.

505
00:19:10,343 --> 00:19:11,643
We'll eat delicious food.

506
00:19:11,643 --> 00:19:14,043
- We'll have the breakfast buffet. / - I'm hungry.

507
00:19:14,043 --> 00:19:14,810
Just follow me.

508
00:19:14,810 --> 00:19:15,543
How will we get there?

509
00:19:15,543 --> 00:19:17,176
First off...

510
00:19:17,176 --> 00:19:18,543
- Don't do things like this. / - For you two...

511
00:19:18,543 --> 00:19:19,343
Don't make us do that.

512
00:19:20,043 --> 00:19:21,843
I rented a car for us.

513
00:19:21,843 --> 00:19:24,076
In Guam, people should rent a car

514
00:19:24,076 --> 00:19:26,510
because they can rent a car with Korean license.

515
00:19:26,510 --> 00:19:27,376
That's right.

516
00:19:27,376 --> 00:19:28,343
Let's head out.

517
00:19:28,343 --> 00:19:29,010
Let's go.

518
00:19:29,010 --> 00:19:30,343

522
00:19:34,076 --> 00:19:35,076
Just do it.

524
00:19:35,576 --> 00:19:37,110

525
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:37,943
Go.

- Sikyung, you take care of lunch. / - Okay.

534

Hey, are you insane?

Hey!

536
00:19:57,343 --> 00:19:58,443
That was scary.

537

Stop.

538
00:20:00,776 --> 00:20:02,610

555
00:20:28,243 --> 00:20:29,943
that viewers submitted for us to try in Guam.

556
00:20:29,943 --> 00:20:30,943
We'll draw them.

557
00:20:30,943 --> 00:20:31,776
It's random.

558
00:20:37,410 --> 00:20:39,610
(The randomly chosen activities will be carried out)

559
00:20:39,610 --> 00:20:41,343
I'll lend you $40,000.

560
00:20:41,343 --> 00:20:42,110
I'll go first.

561
00:20:42,110 --> 00:20:43,243
Hey!

562
00:20:43,243 --> 00:20:44,443
No way.

563
00:20:44,443 --> 00:20:45,510
Sook, run!

564
00:20:47,043 --> 00:20:48,676
You'll die once you come down.

565
00:20:48,676 --> 00:20:50,076
Making me do this...

566
00:20:53,543 --> 00:20:55,110
(Sook time)

567
00:20:55,110 --> 00:20:57,443
(Brunch cafe)

568
00:21:01,043 --> 00:21:02,676
This looks so good.

569
00:21:04,510 --> 00:21:05,810
What is this?

570
00:21:08,543 --> 00:21:11,176
Okay, I've chosen here for breakfast.

571
00:21:11,176 --> 00:21:13,276
It's a good restaurant locals like.

572
00:21:14,076 --> 00:21:14,943
Review.

573
00:21:16,310 --> 00:21:18,743
"It's the best restaurant I've dined at in Guam."

574
00:21:20,376 --> 00:21:22,876
They say they'd go back here if they return to Guam.

575
00:21:23,510 --> 00:21:24,176
Now...

576
00:21:24,176 --> 00:21:25,110
Convertible.

577
00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:26,476
It's not a convertible.

578
00:21:26,476 --> 00:21:27,210
Why not?

579
00:21:27,210 --> 00:21:27,810
Not a convertible?

580
00:21:27,810 --> 00:21:30,110
It's too sunny for that.

581
00:21:31,643 --> 00:21:32,210
It's not this, is it?

582
00:21:32,210 --> 00:21:33,743
- We'll go over. / - No way.

583
00:21:34,976 --> 00:21:36,143
- Hurry up. / - This is ours.

584
00:21:36,143 --> 00:21:38,176
What is this?

585
00:21:38,176 --> 00:21:38,876
It's cute.

586
00:21:38,876 --> 00:21:39,810
No convertible?

587
00:21:39,810 --> 00:21:41,643
I'm in charge of the morning schedule.

588
00:21:41,643 --> 00:21:42,843
- It's not a convertible? / - Come with me.

589
00:21:42,843 --> 00:21:44,310
There's no convertible.

590
00:21:44,943 --> 00:21:46,410
- Get in now. / - Geez.

591
00:21:46,410 --> 00:21:47,943
Gentlemen.

592
00:21:47,943 --> 00:21:49,076
- Get in. / - Seriously.

593
00:21:49,076 --> 00:21:50,610
Thing is...

594
00:21:50,610 --> 00:21:51,976
Geez.

595
00:21:52,943 --> 00:21:53,943
Can't I drive?

596
00:21:53,943 --> 00:21:55,576
No way.

597
00:21:55,576 --> 00:21:56,976
Men shouldn't drive.

598
00:21:58,476 --> 00:21:59,710
Hwijae, trust me.

599
00:22:05,976 --> 00:22:07,010
Goodness.

600
00:22:07,010 --> 00:22:08,343
This is new too.

601
00:22:08,343 --> 00:22:09,343
- This wasn't here before. / - It wasn't.

602
00:22:09,343 --> 00:22:11,076
There are tons of new shopping malls.

603
00:22:11,076 --> 00:22:12,110
You're right.

604
00:22:12,110 --> 00:22:13,943
If you look on the left,

605
00:22:13,943 --> 00:22:15,610
there's a shopping center.

606
00:22:15,610 --> 00:22:17,876
This wasn't here before.

607
00:22:17,876 --> 00:22:19,176
I don't think this was here before.

608
00:22:19,176 --> 00:22:19,943
It wasn't.

609
00:22:23,043 --> 00:22:24,376
(Hotel)

610
00:22:24,376 --> 00:22:25,076
(Brunch cafe)

611
00:22:25,076 --> 00:22:28,376
(4 minutes by car)

612
00:22:28,976 --> 00:22:31,643
If you look in here, it's packed with people.

613
00:22:31,643 --> 00:22:34,110
It's really popular.

614
00:22:34,110 --> 00:22:36,143
The locals, not tourists,

615
00:22:36,143 --> 00:22:38,676
line up to eat here.

616
00:22:38,676 --> 00:22:40,943
What's good at this restaurant?

617
00:22:40,943 --> 00:22:42,576
At 10:30 a.m.,

618
00:22:42,576 --> 00:22:44,576
we can order from both the breakfast and lunch menus.

619
00:22:44,576 --> 00:22:46,010
You must come here at this time

620
00:22:46,010 --> 00:22:47,643
to try food from both menus.

621
00:22:47,643 --> 00:22:48,976
I heard this is a must-try dish.

622
00:22:48,976 --> 00:22:51,810
The Loco Moco comes with a special sauce.

623
00:22:51,810 --> 00:22:53,176
They say the sauce is really good.

624
00:22:53,176 --> 00:22:54,843
- It looks delicious. / - The sauce...

625
00:22:54,843 --> 00:22:56,243
Was made by accident.

626
00:22:56,243 --> 00:22:58,076
They added the wrong ingredient

627
00:22:58,076 --> 00:22:59,676
but it was so delicious.

628
00:22:59,676 --> 00:23:02,076
That's how this special sauce was developed.

629
00:23:02,076 --> 00:23:04,843
A lot of other places tried to figure out the recipe

630
00:23:04,843 --> 00:23:06,943
but they won't tell the last two ingredients.

631
00:23:09,476 --> 00:23:11,110
On top of that, this is a gravy sauce.

632
00:23:11,110 --> 00:23:13,876
It's made from the meat stock.

633
00:23:14,510 --> 00:23:18,276
Just think of it as grease.

634
00:23:18,276 --> 00:23:19,376
That's a great base for sauce.

635
00:23:19,376 --> 00:23:21,243
It's so good but...

636
00:23:21,243 --> 00:23:22,110
To tell you in advance,

637
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:24,110
the gravy sauce is unlimited.

638
00:23:24,110 --> 00:23:25,210
Unlimited.

639
00:23:25,210 --> 00:23:26,176
- It is? / - Yeah.

640
00:23:27,076 --> 00:23:28,410
I like anything that's unlimited.

641
00:23:28,410 --> 00:23:30,710
If you have around 1L of gravy...

642
00:23:30,710 --> 00:23:31,943
You could die.

643
00:23:31,943 --> 00:23:32,876
Unlimited.

644
00:23:33,676 --> 00:23:35,976
We're ready to order.

645
00:23:35,976 --> 00:23:37,810
- Loco Moco. / - Loco Moco no. 1.

646
00:23:37,810 --> 00:23:40,443
- Benedict Chamorro. / - Chamorro Benedict 1.

647
00:23:40,443 --> 00:23:43,043
- And a Salmon Benedict. / - Salmon Benedict 1.

648
00:23:43,043 --> 00:23:43,676
Okay.

649
00:23:43,676 --> 00:23:44,676
Should we start with three?

650
00:23:44,676 --> 00:23:46,110
- Yeah, that's about it. / - Okay.

651
00:23:46,110 --> 00:23:47,610
Should we doggy bag the leftovers?

652
00:23:47,610 --> 00:23:48,710
- Of course. / - Okay.

653
00:23:48,710 --> 00:23:49,576
We must.

654
00:23:49,576 --> 00:23:50,343
Will we have any leftovers?

655
00:23:50,343 --> 00:23:51,310
Nope.

656
00:23:51,310 --> 00:23:52,243
Serious?

657
00:23:52,943 --> 00:23:54,443
There are three of us.

658
00:23:54,443 --> 00:23:54,943
But...

659
00:23:54,943 --> 00:23:56,310
We have two big men here.

660
00:23:56,310 --> 00:23:57,843
But the size...

661
00:23:57,843 --> 00:23:59,076
- An Eggs Benedict is tiny. / - It's tiny.

662
00:23:59,076 --> 00:24:00,176
- It's only this big. / - Oh, really?

663
00:24:00,176 --> 00:24:01,476
- It's like one bite. / - But...

664
00:24:01,476 --> 00:24:02,676
First meal should be grand.

665
00:24:02,676 --> 00:24:04,010
I'm looking forward to this.

666
00:24:04,010 --> 00:24:05,076
Kim Sook's first meal.

667
00:24:06,243 --> 00:24:08,843
(On the Jeju-do trip, she ate)

668
00:24:08,843 --> 00:24:10,976
(And ate)

669
00:24:10,976 --> 00:24:13,110
(And ate some more)

670
00:24:13,110 --> 00:24:15,510
(She ate 5 meals in 1 day)

671
00:24:17,743 --> 00:24:20,010
Can I eat all of this?

672
00:24:20,010 --> 00:24:20,976
I've prepared something.

673
00:24:20,976 --> 00:24:22,843
It was hard to bring this.

674
00:24:22,843 --> 00:24:24,076
I took great care to bring this.

675
00:24:24,076 --> 00:24:24,943
It's so funny.

676
00:24:24,943 --> 00:24:26,010
Great care...

677
00:24:26,010 --> 00:24:27,043
Wait...

678
00:24:27,043 --> 00:24:28,110
Here.

679
00:24:28,110 --> 00:24:29,876
- What is this? / - What is that?

680
00:24:29,876 --> 00:24:30,876
Take a look.

681
00:24:32,010 --> 00:24:34,443
Ta-da.

682
00:24:35,243 --> 00:24:37,843
Ta-da.

683
00:24:39,676 --> 00:24:42,910
(Travel toppers are trending these days)

684
00:24:43,576 --> 00:24:46,410
(Great for taking unique travel photos)

685
00:24:46,810 --> 00:24:49,043
These are a trend these days.

686
00:24:49,043 --> 00:24:49,710
How do you use them?

687
00:24:49,710 --> 00:24:51,076
You take the photo like this.

688
00:24:51,076 --> 00:24:52,310
Once the food is out...

689
00:24:52,310 --> 00:24:56,676
I thought it was for when you tan your skin...

690
00:24:56,676 --> 00:24:58,143
Then you'll have this tanned onto you. No?

691
00:24:58,143 --> 00:24:59,810
Try that out.

692
00:25:00,210 --> 00:25:01,910
(Uninterested)

693
00:25:02,310 --> 00:25:03,876
(He's uninterested as well)

694
00:25:04,276 --> 00:25:05,876
This is so Kim Sook.

695
00:25:07,476 --> 00:25:08,543
You're telling me this isn't pretty?

696
00:25:08,543 --> 00:25:09,643
- Let's see. / - You're telling me this isn't pretty?

697
00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:12,410
It looks like he's trapped.

698
00:25:13,676 --> 00:25:14,643
It's better in the sky.

699
00:25:14,643 --> 00:25:16,343
- Yeah, that looks nice. / - The sky looks nice.

700
00:25:17,310 --> 00:25:19,810
(Guam and the sky by Hwijae)

701
00:25:19,810 --> 00:25:21,676
Here we go.

702
00:25:21,676 --> 00:25:24,576
We've got the French toast right over here.

703
00:25:26,376 --> 00:25:28,443
Your Loco Moco and Eggs Benedict are coming.

704
00:25:31,510 --> 00:25:35,210
(Chamorro-style Eggs Benedict with ground meat)

705
00:25:35,776 --> 00:25:39,243
(Eggs Benedict with plump grilled salmon)

706
00:25:40,843 --> 00:25:42,543
(Hamburg patty with gravy sauce)

707
00:25:42,543 --> 00:25:47,443
(A perfect combination of the Loco Moco)

708
00:25:50,910 --> 00:25:51,943
What do we eat first?

709
00:25:52,543 --> 00:25:54,510
Just eat the dish you want first.

710
00:25:55,176 --> 00:25:56,843
- I'll slice this up. / - Yes, cut that.

711
00:25:56,843 --> 00:25:57,743
Pop the egg.

712
00:26:03,510 --> 00:26:04,743
First meal in Guam.

713
00:26:05,676 --> 00:26:06,410
With bread.

714
00:26:07,776 --> 00:26:08,676
I'll try it.

715
00:26:11,310 --> 00:26:12,176
And salmon.

716
00:26:14,543 --> 00:26:15,243
Sikyung.

717
00:26:16,476 --> 00:26:17,410
And salmon.

718
00:26:19,776 --> 00:26:20,543
Sikyung.

719
00:26:22,276 --> 00:26:23,143
How is it, Sikyung?

720
00:26:24,743 --> 00:26:26,543
We've lived to eat this, right?

721
00:26:27,876 --> 00:26:28,776
Amazing.

722
00:26:30,610 --> 00:26:32,043
It's not that fattening.

723
00:26:32,043 --> 00:26:34,376
This sauce isn't that fattening either.

724
00:26:34,376 --> 00:26:37,043
So it's quite light.

725
00:26:37,043 --> 00:26:39,343
So it's good for breakfast.

726
00:26:39,343 --> 00:26:40,710
You can tell whether

727
00:26:40,710 --> 00:26:42,410
the sauce is fattening or not?

728
00:26:42,410 --> 00:26:43,343
My body can tell.

729
00:26:45,976 --> 00:26:47,510
You'll know what I mean once you taste it.

730
00:26:48,243 --> 00:26:50,943
This is the lightest Eggs Benedict I've had.

731
00:26:50,943 --> 00:26:51,610
You're right.

732
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:54,076
I was very curious about this red potato.

733
00:26:54,076 --> 00:26:55,510
Red potato.

734
00:26:55,510 --> 00:26:57,576
This is red potato.

735
00:26:57,576 --> 00:26:58,610
Red...

736
00:26:58,610 --> 00:27:00,043
- Red potato. / - The red potato...

737
00:27:04,510 --> 00:27:05,243
It's like...

738
00:27:06,276 --> 00:27:09,643
It feels like a mix of potato and radish.

739
00:27:09,643 --> 00:27:10,376
The texture.

740
00:27:11,510 --> 00:27:13,543
Let me try this one.

741
00:27:13,543 --> 00:27:15,443
Benedict Chamorro.

742
00:27:15,443 --> 00:27:17,510
Chamorro people are the natives here, right?

743
00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:19,610
- Chamorro people. / - Saipan and Guam.

744
00:27:20,643 --> 00:27:22,176
(Chamorro Benedict)

745
00:27:22,176 --> 00:27:25,410
(Different to an Eggs Benedict with ham and bacon)

746
00:27:25,410 --> 00:27:27,876
(It's a fusion dish with a Chamorro-style sausage)

747
00:27:27,876 --> 00:27:32,143
(Chamorro Benedict, $14)

748
00:27:32,143 --> 00:27:33,710
Don't touch this one.

749
00:27:33,710 --> 00:27:34,410
Why not?

750
00:27:34,410 --> 00:27:35,410
I must take a photo.

751
00:27:36,876 --> 00:27:39,276
- Hwijae. / - Stick your camera here.

752
00:27:39,276 --> 00:27:41,010
It's too much work to wait for you.

753
00:27:41,010 --> 00:27:42,343
- I must take it. / - Just stick your camera here.

754
00:27:42,343 --> 00:27:43,376
And take photos like this.

755
00:27:43,376 --> 00:27:44,976
I don't like taking food photos.

756
00:27:44,976 --> 00:27:46,276
But when else will I come here?

757
00:27:46,276 --> 00:27:48,210
I have to take photos.

758
00:27:48,210 --> 00:27:49,076
Look how beautiful the colors are.

759
00:27:49,076 --> 00:27:50,010
Upload that photo.

760
00:27:50,843 --> 00:27:51,743
It's so beautiful.

761
00:27:52,443 --> 00:27:53,843
When else will I come here?

762
00:27:53,843 --> 00:27:55,610
I have to take photos.

763
00:27:55,610 --> 00:27:56,476
Look how beautiful the colors are.

764
00:27:56,476 --> 00:27:57,410
Upload that photo.

765
00:27:58,243 --> 00:27:59,143
It's so beautiful.

766
00:28:02,676 --> 00:28:04,010
I'll be back some time.

767
00:28:04,010 --> 00:28:06,876
This dish seems very rugged.

768
00:28:06,876 --> 00:28:09,576
The Chamorro sausage tastes very light.

769
00:28:09,576 --> 00:28:11,243
It's healthier than you'd think.

770
00:28:14,176 --> 00:28:14,910
Also...

771
00:28:16,643 --> 00:28:17,376
It's really...

772
00:28:18,476 --> 00:28:19,343
- Hwijae. / - Yes?

773
00:28:19,343 --> 00:28:21,376
You've been to Guam so many times but never here?

774
00:28:21,376 --> 00:28:22,143
Yeah.

775
00:28:22,143 --> 00:28:23,876
You wasted your trips.

776
00:28:25,843 --> 00:28:26,976
I had no idea this place existed.

777
00:28:28,176 --> 00:28:29,210
Try that dish now.

778
00:28:30,076 --> 00:28:31,476
What is this dish?

779
00:28:31,476 --> 00:28:32,610
Loco Moco.

780
00:28:32,610 --> 00:28:35,276
This is the must-have dish.

781
00:28:36,410 --> 00:28:37,976
It's like a burger...

782
00:28:37,976 --> 00:28:39,376
It's like a burger patty.

783
00:28:39,376 --> 00:28:42,110
Wait. Is that rice and ribs?

784
00:28:42,110 --> 00:28:43,276
It's like a hamburger patty.

785
00:28:43,276 --> 00:28:44,643
It is similar to a burger.

786
00:28:45,243 --> 00:28:46,410
Try it.

787
00:28:47,876 --> 00:28:50,876
(He takes a good portion of the rice and the patty)

788
00:28:53,443 --> 00:28:54,276
How is it?

789
00:28:57,110 --> 00:28:58,276
Is it good?

790
00:28:58,276 --> 00:28:59,476
It has to taste good.

791
00:29:00,310 --> 00:29:01,743
Oh, this one...

792
00:29:01,743 --> 00:29:02,676
This one's quite dangerous.

793
00:29:06,676 --> 00:29:07,476
I should try it now?

794
00:29:08,610 --> 00:29:09,643
That dish is so good.

795
00:29:10,443 --> 00:29:11,843
You have to eat this.

796
00:29:13,243 --> 00:29:13,976
This is the one.

797
00:29:13,976 --> 00:29:15,276
It's the one.

798
00:29:15,276 --> 00:29:16,343
It's so good.

799
00:29:16,910 --> 00:29:19,576
Imagine a really rich mushroom soup.

800
00:29:19,576 --> 00:29:22,110
Really rich. Completely savory.

801
00:29:22,110 --> 00:29:24,076
Add Hamburg steak,

802
00:29:24,076 --> 00:29:25,910
fried egg and rice to that.

803
00:29:25,910 --> 00:29:27,110
It'd be weird if this tastes bad.

804
00:29:27,110 --> 00:29:30,343
We used to add rice to cream soup when we were kids.

805
00:29:31,276 --> 00:29:33,010
The kids will love this dish.

806
00:29:33,643 --> 00:29:34,876
100%.

807
00:29:38,276 --> 00:29:40,043
We should order extra sauce.

808
00:29:40,043 --> 00:29:43,076
One sauce right here.

809
00:29:44,710 --> 00:29:45,643
He's really polite.

810
00:29:45,643 --> 00:29:49,343
(Adding more gravy sauce)

811
00:29:49,343 --> 00:29:50,476
Let me just pour one first.

812
00:29:51,376 --> 00:29:53,110
This feels like around 800 calories.

813
00:29:53,110 --> 00:29:55,876
You can't bother with weight gain here.

814
00:29:55,876 --> 00:29:56,943
You just have to eat.

815
00:29:59,076 --> 00:30:00,343
This one is so good.

816
00:30:01,143 --> 00:30:03,043
When you eat this dish,

817
00:30:03,043 --> 00:30:04,210
it might get too greasy.

818
00:30:04,910 --> 00:30:07,576
With this sauce,

819
00:30:07,576 --> 00:30:08,510
it will refresh your palate.

820
00:30:08,510 --> 00:30:10,010
Think of it as a reset button.

821
00:30:13,643 --> 00:30:15,276
(Dinanche)

822
00:30:15,276 --> 00:30:16,810
(Chamorro-style spicy pepper paste)

823
00:30:16,810 --> 00:30:20,010
(Conne peppers are used to make the paste)

824
00:30:20,010 --> 00:30:22,010
(The spiciness is piquant like Cheongyang peppers)

825
00:30:22,543 --> 00:30:25,110
(Welcome to dinanche)

826
00:30:25,243 --> 00:30:26,210
It's very spicy.

827
00:30:26,210 --> 00:30:28,176
- Very spicy. / - Okay.

828
00:30:28,176 --> 00:30:29,510
- Dinanche. / - They gave us only this much.

829
00:30:29,510 --> 00:30:30,743
This smells strong.

830
00:30:31,276 --> 00:30:32,343
Smells good, right?

831
00:30:32,343 --> 00:30:33,110
Smells good, right?

832
00:30:33,910 --> 00:30:35,676
What's good?

833
00:30:35,676 --> 00:30:36,610
Smells good, right?

834
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:38,310
What's good?

835
00:30:38,310 --> 00:30:39,543
I can't eat this.

836
00:30:40,743 --> 00:30:41,310
Did you try it?

837
00:30:41,310 --> 00:30:41,943
Did you just eat it by itself?

838
00:30:41,943 --> 00:30:42,643
It's spicy.

839
00:30:42,643 --> 00:30:44,376
Koreans must order this.

840
00:30:44,376 --> 00:30:45,510
Isn't this a punishment?

841
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:47,043
No, it's spicy and delicious.

842
00:30:49,143 --> 00:30:50,710
It might be too spicy for you.

843
00:30:50,710 --> 00:30:51,943
It might be too spicy for you.

844
00:30:56,443 --> 00:30:57,676
It might be too spicy for you.

845
00:31:00,110 --> 00:31:01,010
Goodness!

846
00:31:03,476 --> 00:31:04,610
How much did you eat?

847
00:31:05,476 --> 00:31:06,510
This is so delicious.

848
00:31:06,510 --> 00:31:07,343
It's really delicious.

849
00:31:08,976 --> 00:31:09,710
How is this delicious?

850
00:31:09,710 --> 00:31:11,643
But with this sauce, you could finish all this.

851
00:31:12,243 --> 00:31:13,243
How much did you eat?

852
00:31:14,676 --> 00:31:15,543
How much did you eat?

853
00:31:16,276 --> 00:31:18,210
Someone is punching the side of my mouth.

854
00:31:18,210 --> 00:31:19,576
Hwijae, this is so good.

855
00:31:20,410 --> 00:31:21,476
It's so good.

856
00:31:21,476 --> 00:31:22,210
Isn't it so...

857
00:31:25,443 --> 00:31:26,543
It's so good.

858
00:31:27,943 --> 00:31:29,410
- You can start over, right? / - Yes.

859
00:31:29,410 --> 00:31:30,943
- The sauce is... / - Let's start over.

860
00:31:31,710 --> 00:31:34,010
(Looking around)

861
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:36,110
What?

862
00:31:36,110 --> 00:31:37,110
You can have mine.

863
00:31:37,110 --> 00:31:38,310
- Do you still have some? / - Yes.

864
00:31:39,076 --> 00:31:40,310
I like dinanche.

865
00:31:42,643 --> 00:31:43,243
Goodness.

866
00:31:43,843 --> 00:31:44,910
It's so delicious.

867
00:31:44,910 --> 00:31:46,543
It's not the spiciness that makes you angry.

868
00:31:46,543 --> 00:31:48,376
It refreshes you then goes away.

869
00:31:48,376 --> 00:31:49,810
It goes so well with this.

870
00:31:53,643 --> 00:31:56,010
Did you come here for brunch or the spicy sauce?

871
00:31:56,010 --> 00:31:56,743
Dinanche.

872
00:31:56,743 --> 00:31:57,476
Seriously...

873
00:31:57,476 --> 00:31:58,643
Are you going to keep eating dinanche?

874
00:31:58,643 --> 00:31:59,610
Yes, dinanche.

875
00:32:01,743 --> 00:32:03,143
This...

876
00:32:03,143 --> 00:32:05,076
- You can't eat this dish alone. / - You're right.

877
00:32:05,076 --> 00:32:06,076
You need dinanche.

878
00:32:06,076 --> 00:32:07,476
You must eat it with dinanche.

879
00:32:07,476 --> 00:32:10,143
Among everything in Guam, this is my favorite.

880
00:32:10,143 --> 00:32:12,910
- This is only our first meal. / - The color of the sea...

881
00:32:12,910 --> 00:32:15,310
The hotel, and Eggs Benedict are nothing

882
00:32:15,310 --> 00:32:16,410
compared to this. You must try it.

883
00:32:16,410 --> 00:32:18,243
I'm sure Koreans will love it.

884
00:32:18,243 --> 00:32:19,243
This is all the sauce I ate alone, right?

885
00:32:19,243 --> 00:32:21,410
(Sikyung finished 6 cups of sauce alone)

886
00:32:21,810 --> 00:32:24,510
How would you rate this restaurant?

887
00:32:24,510 --> 00:32:25,810
Let's make it out of 5.

888
00:32:28,610 --> 00:32:30,310
I've been to Guam many times

889
00:32:30,310 --> 00:32:32,510
but this is my first time trying this brunch.

890
00:32:32,510 --> 00:32:34,443
Let me be honest with you.

891
00:32:34,443 --> 00:32:35,943
Out of 5 points,

892
00:32:35,943 --> 00:32:37,510
I give it 4.5.

893
00:32:39,343 --> 00:32:41,576
Sikyung is busy eating. Don't bother.

894
00:32:41,576 --> 00:32:42,776
I'll go out for a minute.

895
00:32:43,543 --> 00:32:44,576
You should rate it like this.

896
00:32:44,576 --> 00:32:46,443
Before and after dinanche.

897
00:32:46,443 --> 00:32:47,510
How many points before dinanche?

898
00:32:48,943 --> 00:32:49,876
3 points.

899
00:32:50,710 --> 00:32:52,043
What about after dinanche?

900
00:32:52,676 --> 00:32:53,610
4.3 points.

901
00:32:54,443 --> 00:32:55,176
I'm serious.

902
00:32:55,176 --> 00:32:56,243
Let me tell you why.

903
00:32:56,243 --> 00:32:58,776
Eggs Benedict is common in Korea as well,

904
00:32:58,776 --> 00:33:01,010
if you've tried the dish, it's a bit...

905
00:33:01,010 --> 00:33:03,043
You'll be like, "What is this?" With the bread...

906
00:33:03,843 --> 00:33:05,543
Just as I said, it's like a good soup

907
00:33:05,543 --> 00:33:08,276
with rice and meat so everyone will like it.

908
00:33:08,276 --> 00:33:10,810
But with the dinanche,

909
00:33:10,810 --> 00:33:12,543
I've gone crazy. I ate everything.

910
00:33:13,510 --> 00:33:14,843
Dinanche, dinanche.

911
00:33:26,276 --> 00:33:28,110
The weather is so nice.

912
00:33:28,110 --> 00:33:29,876
The sky looks amazing.

913
00:33:29,876 --> 00:33:31,676
- Should we walk there? / - Look.

914
00:33:31,676 --> 00:33:33,276
- Let me tell you something. / - What?

915
00:33:33,276 --> 00:33:35,976
There's an ice cream store in there.

916
00:33:35,976 --> 00:33:37,976
Let's eat ice cream on the way.

917
00:33:37,976 --> 00:33:39,343
Let's go there.

918
00:33:39,343 --> 00:33:40,410
Why not? Let's go.

919
00:33:40,410 --> 00:33:42,510
I don't think we have enough time.

920
00:33:42,510 --> 00:33:44,243
Even a short walk

921
00:33:44,243 --> 00:33:46,343
makes my body sweat so much.

922
00:33:46,343 --> 00:33:47,410
That's why...

923
00:33:47,410 --> 00:33:50,676
- It's over there. Let's get some ice cream. / - Yeah.

924
00:33:51,543 --> 00:33:52,843
Yeah.

925
00:33:52,843 --> 00:33:54,876
Let's get some ice cream.

926
00:33:54,876 --> 00:33:56,310
But we have to wait a bit.

927
00:33:56,310 --> 00:33:57,510
No, there is no queue now.

928
00:33:57,510 --> 00:33:58,610
Really? Let's go then.

929
00:33:58,610 --> 00:33:59,643
Let's go then.

930
00:33:59,643 --> 00:34:00,310
Are you sure?

931
00:34:00,310 --> 00:34:01,143
Yes.

932
00:34:02,076 --> 00:34:04,476
(They happily head to the ice cream store)

933
00:34:05,610 --> 00:34:07,010
Wow. Look. It looks tasty.

934
00:34:09,010 --> 00:34:10,276
- See? There's a line. / - I'm excited.

935
00:34:10,276 --> 00:34:11,610
Hwijae, it looks really delicious.

936
00:34:12,810 --> 00:34:14,243
- What is this? / - You must come here.

937
00:34:15,043 --> 00:34:16,110
Mine is ready.

938
00:34:16,976 --> 00:34:17,943
Mine is ready.

939
00:34:18,910 --> 00:34:20,210
It's ready.

940
00:34:21,610 --> 00:34:22,376
Thank you.

941
00:34:22,376 --> 00:34:23,610
It looks beautiful.

942
00:34:25,576 --> 00:34:26,943
It looks so beautiful.

943
00:34:32,576 --> 00:34:34,643
(It melts in her mouth)

944
00:34:35,143 --> 00:34:36,876
This is so much better than Eggs Benedict.

945
00:34:40,610 --> 00:34:42,276
It's so delicious.

946
00:34:43,976 --> 00:34:45,476
I don't really like sweets.

947
00:34:46,476 --> 00:34:48,943
But you have to eat something like this in hot weather.

948
00:34:49,943 --> 00:34:51,110
Your body sucks it up.

949
00:34:52,410 --> 00:34:55,843
(Like this)

950
00:34:56,843 --> 00:34:58,843
- I'm so happy. / - This is nice.

951
00:34:58,843 --> 00:34:59,510
It's delicious, isn't it?

952
00:34:59,510 --> 00:35:02,343
The cone is so good too.

953
00:35:04,110 --> 00:35:05,343
Oh, my God.

954
00:35:06,076 --> 00:35:07,476
- Oh, my God. / - Oh, my God.

955
00:35:08,976 --> 00:35:10,310
- We're here? / - Do you see that?

956
00:35:11,310 --> 00:35:12,243
That wire, Sook.

957
00:35:12,243 --> 00:35:13,143
What is that?

958
00:35:13,910 --> 00:35:15,410
Does this drop you into the water? What is this?

959
00:35:15,410 --> 00:35:17,610
No, you ride this on the ground.

960
00:35:17,610 --> 00:35:19,843
It's like a ball going straight up...

961
00:35:19,843 --> 00:35:21,410
- Then coming down. / - Okay.

962
00:35:21,410 --> 00:35:23,676
It's pulled back and as soon as it's released,

963
00:35:23,676 --> 00:35:24,543
you spring into the sky.

964
00:35:24,543 --> 00:35:25,543
No thanks for me.

965
00:35:25,543 --> 00:35:26,743
No thanks for me.

966
00:35:26,743 --> 00:35:28,476
- Let's ride this with me. / - No, I'm not doing this.

967
00:35:28,476 --> 00:35:30,543
I feel safe only when my feet are touching the ground.

968
00:35:30,543 --> 00:35:32,410
I like being held down by gravity.

969
00:35:34,543 --> 00:35:35,843
(Sikyung's time)

970
00:35:35,843 --> 00:35:38,543
(Slingshot of horror)

971
00:35:39,343 --> 00:35:40,510
- We're here? / - Do you see that?

972
00:35:41,410 --> 00:35:42,710
That wire, Sook.

973
00:35:42,710 --> 00:35:43,610
Are you insane?

974
00:35:43,610 --> 00:35:44,776
I'm not riding that.

975
00:35:48,843 --> 00:35:50,910
(Slingshot)

976
00:35:50,910 --> 00:35:53,676
(A landmark of Guam)

977
00:35:53,676 --> 00:35:56,443
(You fly up 70m in just 2 seconds)

978
00:36:11,043 --> 00:36:12,610
Imagine flying to the sky.

979
00:36:12,610 --> 00:36:13,743
How awesome is that?

980
00:36:13,743 --> 00:36:15,643
Hey, you... Are you insane?

981
00:36:15,643 --> 00:36:18,176
You... I can't do this.

982
00:36:18,176 --> 00:36:19,443
Forget it!

983
00:36:19,443 --> 00:36:20,643
Why you...

984
00:36:20,643 --> 00:36:22,343
I feel safe only when my feet are touching the ground.

985
00:36:22,343 --> 00:36:24,443
I like being held down by gravity.

986
00:36:24,443 --> 00:36:26,476
Hey, seriously...

987
00:36:26,476 --> 00:36:28,010
You're really scared.

988
00:36:28,010 --> 00:36:29,476
No, seriously...

989
00:36:29,476 --> 00:36:30,943
You're so scared.

990
00:36:30,943 --> 00:36:31,843
It looks fun.

991
00:36:31,843 --> 00:36:32,710
I'm not doing this.

992
00:36:32,710 --> 00:36:34,143
No, I mean it...

993
00:36:35,643 --> 00:36:37,476
(He catches her)

994
00:36:37,476 --> 00:36:38,543
Come here.

995
00:36:39,543 --> 00:36:41,010
Stop trying to run away.

996
00:36:41,010 --> 00:36:42,076
Gosh, look at that.

997
00:36:42,076 --> 00:36:43,710
It looks so horrifying.

998
00:36:43,710 --> 00:36:46,176
Look at the eyes. They look just like mine.

999
00:36:46,176 --> 00:36:47,543
Hwijae, I don't think I can do this.

1000
00:36:48,476 --> 00:36:49,910
- You can do it. / - I'm serious.

1001
00:36:49,910 --> 00:36:52,110
- I can't do it. / - You can do it.

1002
00:36:52,110 --> 00:36:52,843
You're the host.

1003
00:36:52,843 --> 00:36:54,043
You won't do it for our 2nd anniversary?

1004
00:36:57,676 --> 00:36:59,010
Hey, that is...

1005
00:36:59,010 --> 00:37:00,076
Hwijae,

1006
00:37:00,076 --> 00:37:01,476
I'm so scared.

1007
00:37:02,443 --> 00:37:03,010
Are you being serious?

1008
00:37:03,010 --> 00:37:04,143
I'm being serious.

1009
00:37:04,143 --> 00:37:05,910
But this isn't scary.

1010
00:37:05,910 --> 00:37:07,343
I think I've wet my pants already.

1011
00:37:08,376 --> 00:37:10,443
- Hey. / - I mean it.

1012
00:37:10,443 --> 00:37:12,243
I might poop my pants.

1013
00:37:12,243 --> 00:37:15,143
We've introduced many rides.

1014
00:37:15,143 --> 00:37:16,876
- We have. / - We introduced rides in Japan...

1015
00:37:16,876 --> 00:37:18,276
And Daegu as well.

1016
00:37:18,276 --> 00:37:19,710
Do you remember Eunkwang?

1017
00:37:19,710 --> 00:37:22,643
(Don't forget your lipstick when you get on rides)

1018
00:37:22,943 --> 00:37:27,743
(Episode 16, Taiwan, aired July 30th, 2016)

1019
00:37:27,743 --> 00:37:30,743
(Episode 62, water activities, aired August 5th, 2017)

1020
00:37:31,376 --> 00:37:34,810
(Eunkwang and Changseob entertained us with lipstick)

1021
00:37:35,876 --> 00:37:40,310
(Forget all that, I can't think right now)

1022
00:37:40,310 --> 00:37:42,776
- Let's ride it. Sook, are you listening to me? / - Yes.

1023
00:37:42,776 --> 00:37:45,676
Do you win if you make it look pretty?

1024
00:37:45,676 --> 00:37:46,743
Or if you make it look funny?

1025
00:37:46,743 --> 00:37:48,343
- Make it funny wins. / - Okay.

1026
00:37:49,476 --> 00:37:51,710
Just eat the lipstick.

1027
00:37:51,710 --> 00:37:54,376
Alright. I will ride it.

1028
00:37:54,376 --> 00:37:55,976
But Sikyung, you ride it first.

1029
00:37:55,976 --> 00:37:57,776
- Come on. / - That's meaningless.

1030
00:37:57,776 --> 00:37:59,743
- It's meaningless if you do that. / - Let me see first.

1031
00:37:59,743 --> 00:38:01,310
- You two ride it first. / - Okay.

1032
00:38:01,310 --> 00:38:02,210
I'll keep my word.

1033
00:38:02,210 --> 00:38:04,976
What will you do if you run away?

1034
00:38:08,210 --> 00:38:10,943
- If you run away... / - Give me a pen and paper.

1035
00:38:10,943 --> 00:38:14,810
(What is he up to?)

1036
00:38:14,810 --> 00:38:17,310
Do you have to be like that, Sikyung?

1037
00:38:17,310 --> 00:38:19,010
Don't you trust me?

1038
00:38:19,010 --> 00:38:21,476
If she runs away, she'll have to give us all her money.

1039
00:38:21,476 --> 00:38:23,576
I don't think she'll give all her money to us.

1040
00:38:23,576 --> 00:38:25,443
Let's make it $10,000.

1041
00:38:27,343 --> 00:38:29,210
I will take your $10,000

1042
00:38:29,210 --> 00:38:30,443
and use it for Battle Trip.

1043
00:38:30,443 --> 00:38:31,643
- In case she runs away. / - Yeah.

1044
00:38:31,643 --> 00:38:33,676
Geez... $10,000 is too much.

1045
00:38:34,810 --> 00:38:36,776
You're so tenacious.

1046
00:38:37,676 --> 00:38:39,843
Use the lipstick to add your seal.

1047
00:38:40,276 --> 00:38:42,710
You're so tenacious.

1048
00:38:44,476 --> 00:38:45,510
Here you are.

1049
00:38:45,510 --> 00:38:47,110
Please blur out the important bits.

1050
00:38:47,110 --> 00:38:48,843
March 16th, 2018.

1051
00:38:48,843 --> 00:38:51,110
If she does not ride the typhoon slingshot,

1052
00:38:51,110 --> 00:38:52,343
she will transfer $10,000

1053
00:38:52,343 --> 00:38:54,443
to the production staff of KBS Battle Trip.

1054
00:38:56,810 --> 00:38:57,976
- Let's go. / - Let's go.

1055
00:38:59,076 --> 00:39:00,743
- We'll be back. / - Yeah.

1056
00:39:02,543 --> 00:39:04,843
Wow, you're so brave.

1057
00:39:04,843 --> 00:39:07,443
- What's brave about this? / - What's brave?

1058
00:39:08,143 --> 00:39:12,010
My heart is beating faster.

1059
00:39:12,410 --> 00:39:13,510
Oh, no.

1060
00:39:17,110 --> 00:39:20,243
(Slingshot standby)

1061
00:39:21,210 --> 00:39:23,810
(Shaking)

1062
00:39:24,243 --> 00:39:27,010
Why are they lying down?

1063
00:39:27,710 --> 00:39:28,776
Here it comes.

1064
00:39:29,710 --> 00:39:31,510
Hwijae, do we shoot out like this?

1065
00:39:31,510 --> 00:39:33,443
Yes, after the countdown.

1066
00:39:33,943 --> 00:39:36,176
- Are you ready? / - Yes, we're ready!

1067
00:39:39,410 --> 00:39:41,543
(Fire)

1068
00:39:43,043 --> 00:39:47,510
(They're shot up to the sky)

1069
00:39:51,143 --> 00:39:53,776
(Sook watches them from behind)

1070
00:39:55,410 --> 00:39:57,610
(Out of it)

1071
00:40:00,776 --> 00:40:03,110
(They fly towards the sun)

1072
00:40:03,110 --> 00:40:06,676
(Spin)

1073
00:40:07,543 --> 00:40:10,510
(This is the slingshot)

1074
00:40:14,010 --> 00:40:18,676
(Starts putting on lipstick right away)

1075
00:40:18,676 --> 00:40:20,776
You jerks!

1076
00:40:21,243 --> 00:40:23,976
Hey, you jerks!

1077
00:40:24,343 --> 00:40:27,543
(Hwijae can't even keep his eyes open)

1078
00:40:28,143 --> 00:40:30,710
You jerks!

1079
00:40:31,643 --> 00:40:33,776
Hey, you jerks!

1080
00:40:34,243 --> 00:40:37,143
Hey, you jerks!

1081
00:40:37,143 --> 00:40:38,510
This is insane.

1082
00:40:38,510 --> 00:40:40,043
It goes up too high even the second time.

1083
00:40:42,843 --> 00:40:45,043
You jerks!

1084
00:40:46,276 --> 00:40:47,243
This is fun.

1085
00:40:48,876 --> 00:40:51,243
You can't put it on now just to be funny.

1086
00:40:58,543 --> 00:40:59,376
Oh, my God.

1087
00:41:00,243 --> 00:41:01,210
Oh, my God.

1088
00:41:01,743 --> 00:41:02,876
Oh, my God.

1089
00:41:02,876 --> 00:41:05,110
Dahye, how much money do you have?

1090
00:41:05,710 --> 00:41:07,210
How much do you have?

1091
00:41:07,210 --> 00:41:09,310
How much cash do we have in total?

1092
00:41:09,310 --> 00:41:10,176
$50.00

1093
00:41:10,876 --> 00:41:13,076
$50? We have $50?

1094
00:41:13,076 --> 00:41:17,543
Hang on a second. Then I just need $9,950 more.

1095
00:41:17,543 --> 00:41:19,343
Director, how much do you have?

1096
00:41:19,343 --> 00:41:21,310
Please donate some money to me.

1097
00:41:21,310 --> 00:41:22,410
Oh, my God.

1098
00:41:24,576 --> 00:41:26,243
This is awesome.

1099
00:41:28,743 --> 00:41:30,810
- It's a great view. / - This is nice.

1100
00:41:31,243 --> 00:41:33,276
But I can't see anything without my glasses.

1101
00:41:35,876 --> 00:41:38,010
- This isn't scary at all. / - Exactly.

1102
00:41:38,010 --> 00:41:40,010
(Just a minute ago)

1103
00:41:40,010 --> 00:41:43,676
(Can't help but act like it was nothing)

1104
00:41:47,310 --> 00:41:48,376
Oh, my God.

1105
00:41:49,910 --> 00:41:52,043
Hwijae, is your nose bleeding?

1106
00:41:52,843 --> 00:41:54,676
Sook, I told you.

1107
00:41:54,676 --> 00:41:56,243
If we go first, you can't ride it.

1108
00:41:56,243 --> 00:41:57,343
Hey.

1109
00:41:59,110 --> 00:42:00,743
Sikyung, you're so pretty.

1110
00:42:01,310 --> 00:42:04,476
- How did you draw that mole? / - I put in the effort.

1111
00:42:04,476 --> 00:42:06,210
Do you know how you look now, do you?

1112
00:42:07,876 --> 00:42:09,610
Ride with me. I want to go on it again.

1113
00:42:09,610 --> 00:42:12,343
I just borrowed $50.

1114
00:42:12,343 --> 00:42:15,343
- I just need $9,950 more. / - Stop messing around.

1115
00:42:15,643 --> 00:42:17,610
Can someone lend me money?

1116
00:42:17,610 --> 00:42:19,410
I've collected $50.

1117
00:42:19,410 --> 00:42:22,343
Can someone lend me $9,950?

1118
00:42:22,676 --> 00:42:24,510
I'm just so scared.

1119
00:42:24,510 --> 00:42:26,643
- Hey, wait. / - Sook!

1120
00:42:27,310 --> 00:42:27,943
Wait a minute.

1121
00:42:28,543 --> 00:42:31,376
Someone please lend me $9,950?

1122
00:42:33,576 --> 00:42:35,010
(Running on the spot)

1123
00:42:38,610 --> 00:42:40,243
Help me!

1124
00:42:41,843 --> 00:42:43,143
I'm so scared.

1125
00:42:43,143 --> 00:42:44,776
He doesn't care. Oh, that's hot.

1126
00:42:46,243 --> 00:42:47,343
He doesn't even care.

1127
00:42:47,343 --> 00:42:49,143
I don't think I can ride this.

1128
00:42:49,576 --> 00:42:50,910
Wait. Sikyung.

1129
00:42:52,043 --> 00:42:53,243
Sikyung.

1130
00:42:53,243 --> 00:42:54,443
My heart's beating too fast.

1131
00:42:54,443 --> 00:42:55,376
- I'll be okay, right? / - Yeah.

1132
00:42:55,376 --> 00:42:57,310
- Where? / - I grab here, right?

1133
00:42:57,310 --> 00:42:59,510
Sook, your face looks really weird.

1134
00:42:59,510 --> 00:43:00,610
Smile.

1135
00:43:00,610 --> 00:43:01,710
- Hwijae. / - Are you good?

1136
00:43:01,710 --> 00:43:03,343
I'm so scared.

1137
00:43:04,276 --> 00:43:05,476
Let's go!

1138
00:43:06,276 --> 00:43:07,176
I'm so scared.

1139
00:43:08,043 --> 00:43:10,043
- Sikyung. / - Sook, don't swear.

1140
00:43:10,643 --> 00:43:12,210
I don't know. Goodness.

1141
00:43:12,210 --> 00:43:13,476
The sun is too hot.

1142
00:43:14,343 --> 00:43:15,943
- Will you be okay? / - I'm too scared.

1143
00:43:15,943 --> 00:43:17,476
- This isn't scary. It's okay. / - My eyes won't open.

1144
00:43:17,476 --> 00:43:18,276
It's really not scary.

1145
00:43:18,276 --> 00:43:19,210
Here we go.

1146
00:43:19,210 --> 00:43:21,110
- We're going now? / - Yes.

1147
00:43:21,110 --> 00:43:22,410
They're going.

1148
00:43:24,343 --> 00:43:25,143
We're going.

1149
00:43:26,176 --> 00:43:27,610
(Ready, set)

1150
00:43:27,610 --> 00:43:29,076
(Go!)

1151
00:43:29,776 --> 00:43:33,110
(It shoots up without a warning)

1152
00:43:36,976 --> 00:43:41,910
(Shaking)

1153
00:43:44,210 --> 00:43:46,076
(Screaming)

1154
00:43:46,076 --> 00:43:47,076
(Screaming)

1155
00:43:50,210 --> 00:43:52,343
Lipstick... Lipstick...

1156
00:43:53,976 --> 00:43:56,643
(Though she's scared, she does what she needs to)

1157
00:43:57,010 --> 00:43:59,076
(Screaming)

1158
00:43:59,710 --> 00:44:03,110
(Sook's misfortune makes Hwijae happy)

1159
00:44:04,510 --> 00:44:08,710
(Sook's voice echoes in Guam)

1160
00:44:10,276 --> 00:44:13,610
(Sikyung puts his glasses on so he can see the view)

1161
00:44:14,976 --> 00:44:18,943
(He is excited)

1162
00:44:20,410 --> 00:44:23,343
(Can he be more excited than this?)

1163
00:44:27,943 --> 00:44:29,643
Are you okay? You're okay, right?

1164
00:44:29,976 --> 00:44:30,943
Are you okay?

1165
00:44:30,943 --> 00:44:33,276
- This is scary. / - You're okay, right?

1166
00:44:35,310 --> 00:44:37,876
(Laughing)

1167
00:44:37,876 --> 00:44:39,110
It's okay, right?

1168
00:44:39,643 --> 00:44:40,810
It's nothing, right?

1169
00:44:40,810 --> 00:44:42,343
- Sikyung. / - Look at the view.

1170
00:44:42,343 --> 00:44:44,476
Forget the view. Hey...

1171
00:44:44,476 --> 00:44:47,143
I'm going to hit you when we get down.

1172
00:44:47,143 --> 00:44:49,110
Why? Let's ask them if we can ride this again.

1173
00:44:49,110 --> 00:44:52,110
Hey. You...

1174
00:44:52,110 --> 00:44:53,910
- Don't mess with you. / - I mean it.

1175
00:44:53,910 --> 00:44:56,576
- My heart is up there. / - Really. Once more.

1176
00:44:56,576 --> 00:44:58,176
Don't mess around.

1177
00:44:58,910 --> 00:45:00,376
- Stop. / - Come on, Sook.

1178
00:45:00,376 --> 00:45:01,043
I mean it... I'll...

1179
00:45:03,143 --> 00:45:04,643
Can we ride it again?

1180
00:45:04,643 --> 00:45:06,210
Don't mess with me.

1181
00:45:06,210 --> 00:45:08,043
- You're insane. / - Go up right away.

1182
00:45:08,043 --> 00:45:10,143
Stop it. Hurry up.

1183
00:45:14,010 --> 00:45:15,610
- Be quiet. / - Let's go once more.

1184
00:45:15,610 --> 00:45:17,643
Come on, Sikyung. Hey...

1185
00:45:18,776 --> 00:45:19,876
Let go!

1186
00:45:19,876 --> 00:45:21,810
- Okay, go! / - Don't!

1187
00:45:21,810 --> 00:45:23,943
Help me! Help me!

1188
00:45:25,443 --> 00:45:28,376
Don't! Help me! Help me!

1189
00:45:31,010 --> 00:45:33,110
We could go again right away.

1190
00:45:34,443 --> 00:45:36,076
You look like "The Slave Hunters."

1191
00:45:36,443 --> 00:45:39,410
(Slave hunter, Sook)

1192
00:45:39,976 --> 00:45:41,743
Let go! Let go!

1193
00:45:42,643 --> 00:45:44,343
(Her fury rises)

1194
00:45:44,943 --> 00:45:46,610
(Good job, Sook)

1195
00:45:50,343 --> 00:45:51,676
I was so angry.

1196
00:45:51,676 --> 00:45:54,010
I got so angry when I was putting on the lipstick.

1197
00:45:54,676 --> 00:45:55,810
I won't hang out with you.

1198
00:45:55,810 --> 00:45:57,476
- I will travel alone. / - How was it?

1199
00:45:58,543 --> 00:46:00,410
- It was a little fun. / - See?

1200
00:46:00,410 --> 00:46:02,510
See? It's half-half.

1201
00:46:03,010 --> 00:46:04,776
But it's so scary.

1202
00:46:04,776 --> 00:46:08,210
It's scary and... What view is up there?

1203
00:46:08,210 --> 00:46:10,443
- When you go up. / - Because she's small.

1204
00:46:10,443 --> 00:46:11,743
She couldn't see.

1205
00:46:11,743 --> 00:46:13,043
It's even hard for me.

1206
00:46:13,576 --> 00:46:15,943
I'm seriously...

1207
00:46:15,943 --> 00:46:17,310
Wow...

1208
00:46:17,476 --> 00:46:20,110
(I'm so angry!)

1209
00:46:20,110 --> 00:46:22,376
I need to take this out on someone.

1210
00:46:22,376 --> 00:46:23,076
I'm so annoyed.

1211
00:46:23,076 --> 00:46:25,210
You have to give an honest review.

1212
00:46:25,210 --> 00:46:26,943
If you like riding rides,

1213
00:46:26,943 --> 00:46:29,276
this is fun, not scary.

1214
00:46:29,276 --> 00:46:32,276
- You two should go again. / - No...

1215
00:46:34,076 --> 00:46:37,643
(The viewers will choose who looks the funniest)

1216
00:46:38,143 --> 00:46:41,110
Out of five stars...

1217
00:46:42,143 --> 00:46:44,010
I give it 1.9 stars.

1218
00:46:45,476 --> 00:46:47,610
Well... It's fun.

1219
00:46:47,610 --> 00:46:50,476
I give it 2.5 stars.

1220
00:46:50,476 --> 00:46:52,410
Exactly half.

1221
00:46:52,410 --> 00:46:54,110
It's worth riding once

1222
00:46:54,110 --> 00:46:55,843
even if you're scared of rides like me.

1223
00:46:56,376 --> 00:46:57,676
I recommend it.

1224
00:46:58,943 --> 00:47:02,543
Now I finally feel excited since it's over.

1225
00:47:02,543 --> 00:47:04,776
I gave it too low a score.

1226
00:47:05,743 --> 00:47:07,876
You start to feel different now.

1227
00:47:07,876 --> 00:47:09,176
Right? It feels different, right?

1228
00:47:09,176 --> 00:47:12,610
After about 20 minutes, I feel different.

1229
00:47:13,076 --> 00:47:15,110
- Because... / - I want to complain to someone.

1230
00:47:15,110 --> 00:47:16,476
Now I feel happy.

1231
00:47:16,476 --> 00:47:18,276
- Now I feel excited. / - Really?

1232
00:47:18,276 --> 00:47:20,376
- I was scared before. / - That's good.

1233
00:47:20,376 --> 00:47:22,343
So will you rate it again?

1234
00:47:22,343 --> 00:47:23,276
- Yes. / - Yes, I will.

1235
00:47:23,276 --> 00:47:25,643
I'll give it 4.5 out of 5.

1236
00:47:25,643 --> 00:47:27,110
- That high? / - Yes.

1237
00:47:27,110 --> 00:47:28,543
It's so much fun after it's over.

1238
00:47:28,543 --> 00:47:31,276
I gave it 2.5 before.

1239
00:47:31,276 --> 00:47:32,776
Because I felt half scared and half excited.

1240
00:47:32,776 --> 00:47:35,643
I'll give you 2 more stars.

1241
00:47:36,610 --> 00:47:38,710
- It's worth riding at least once, right? / - Yeah.

1242
00:47:41,310 --> 00:47:46,976
(They head to the next destination)

1243
00:47:52,910 --> 00:47:56,976
(Battle Trip 2-year anniversary)

1244
00:47:57,843 --> 00:48:01,076
- Fishing, fishing. / - Fishing.

1245
00:48:01,076 --> 00:48:04,843
It's become popular because of Gyeonggyu.

1246
00:48:04,843 --> 00:48:06,443
Fishing is actually fun.

1247
00:48:06,443 --> 00:48:06,943
It is.

1248
00:48:06,943 --> 00:48:09,010
If we can catch it and eat it.

1249
00:48:09,010 --> 00:48:10,976
It's possible.

1250
00:48:10,976 --> 00:48:15,510
If the captain has a license, it's possible.

1251
00:48:15,510 --> 00:48:16,976
- Let's do that. / - We can make raw fish.

1252
00:48:16,976 --> 00:48:18,276
- Yes. / - Eat raw fish?

1253
00:48:18,276 --> 00:48:20,343
Since this is supposed to be a family trip,

1254
00:48:20,343 --> 00:48:22,943
we should think about what kids like too.

1255
00:48:22,943 --> 00:48:24,343
It may not be fun for us

1256
00:48:24,343 --> 00:48:26,243
but for the viewers...

1257
00:48:26,243 --> 00:48:28,076
(Brain working at full speed)

1258
00:48:28,076 --> 00:48:29,976
(We believe in you, Guam professor)

1259
00:48:31,476 --> 00:48:33,110
You're like a Guam native.

1260
00:48:33,976 --> 00:48:36,676
You like dolphins, right?

1261
00:48:36,676 --> 00:48:38,743
- I like them. / - That's it then.

1262
00:48:38,743 --> 00:48:41,810
You say you'd take us to see dolphins

1263
00:48:41,810 --> 00:48:44,210
but if we don't get to see them, I'll hit you.

1264
00:48:44,210 --> 00:48:46,510
If you can't see dolphins, I'll be the dolphin.

1265
00:48:46,510 --> 00:48:48,776
- You have to do the dolphin show. / - Yes, I will.

1266
00:48:48,776 --> 00:48:51,810
- You have to paint yourself gray. / - Okay.

1267
00:48:51,810 --> 00:48:55,043
- I'll paint myself half gray. / - Half white.

1268
00:48:55,043 --> 00:48:56,643
- I'll use two tones. / - Yes, two tones.

1269
00:48:56,643 --> 00:48:58,543
I'll transform perfectly into a dolphin.

1270
00:48:58,543 --> 00:49:00,343
- Water has to spurt from your head. / - Okay.

1271
00:49:01,043 --> 00:49:01,810
Make dolphin noises too.

1272
00:49:01,810 --> 00:49:04,143
- Okay, okay. / - You have to make that sound.

1273
00:49:04,143 --> 00:49:07,710
In Guam, you don't have to sail out too far.

1274
00:49:07,710 --> 00:49:09,010
You can see dolphins easily.

1275
00:49:09,010 --> 00:49:10,043
Don't worry.

1276
00:49:11,343 --> 00:49:13,943
This course is prepared by old man Hwijae.

1277
00:49:14,676 --> 00:49:20,943
(Fishing in Guam)

1278
00:49:20,943 --> 00:49:29,010
(Snorkeling in Guam)

1279
00:49:29,010 --> 00:49:34,843
(Dolphins in Guam)

1280
00:49:34,843 --> 00:49:36,343
This is amazing.

1281
00:49:39,076 --> 00:49:44,976
(3 things to do in Guam by the Guam professor)

1282
00:49:47,110 --> 00:49:48,376
(Hwijae's time)

1283
00:49:48,376 --> 00:49:52,076
(Dolphin cruise)

1284
00:49:52,310 --> 00:49:57,243
(After racing along the coastal road)

1285
00:49:57,743 --> 00:50:00,410
(They meet the blue sea and clear sky)

1286
00:50:00,410 --> 00:50:03,543
(Boats are docked at the marina)

1287
00:50:04,810 --> 00:50:07,176
- This is great. / - I feel like I'm on vacation.

1288
00:50:07,176 --> 00:50:09,610
- Seriously. Amazing. / - We are on vacation.

1289
00:50:10,943 --> 00:50:13,143
(She's ecstatic)

1290
00:50:13,143 --> 00:50:14,710
I feel like I'm in a foreign country.

1291
00:50:15,276 --> 00:50:16,310
Hafa adai.

1292
00:50:16,310 --> 00:50:18,843
- Hafa adai. / - Hafa adai.

1293
00:50:18,843 --> 00:50:22,343
(They get on the boat to enjoy the Guam ocean)

1294
00:50:23,243 --> 00:50:24,910
This is Guam.

1295
00:50:24,910 --> 00:50:27,243
Hwijae prepared a lot.

1296
00:50:27,643 --> 00:50:30,810
This course is prepared by old man Hwijae.

1297
00:50:30,810 --> 00:50:32,943
We'll see dolphins, fish and go snorkeling.

1298
00:50:36,910 --> 00:50:38,176
- Hwijae. / - Yes?

1299
00:50:38,176 --> 00:50:39,376
I feel like I'm on vacation now.

1300
00:50:39,376 --> 00:50:42,410
- This really feels like Guam, right? / - This is great.

1301
00:50:42,410 --> 00:50:45,476
(First, they'll have a dolphin tour)

1302
00:50:46,243 --> 00:50:49,543
(Hwijae is very excited)

1303
00:50:50,010 --> 00:50:51,776
(Here's Battle Trip's youngest)

1304
00:50:51,976 --> 00:50:52,743
(Glancing over)

1305
00:50:53,243 --> 00:50:56,176
(Sook, look at the camera)

1306
00:50:57,810 --> 00:50:58,876
Are you recording?

1307
00:50:59,576 --> 00:51:01,643
(I'm excited!)

1308
00:51:01,643 --> 00:51:03,943
It feels like yesterday that we were in the studio.

1309
00:51:03,943 --> 00:51:06,643
- But we're really here. / - This is nice.

1310
00:51:07,176 --> 00:51:09,143
(They get to see a great landscape)

1311
00:51:09,610 --> 00:51:11,010
Hwijae, look here.

1312
00:51:11,310 --> 00:51:12,943
(Acting silly)

1313
00:51:13,176 --> 00:51:15,176
1, 2, 3.

1314
00:51:17,176 --> 00:51:19,210
It's so beautiful.

1315
00:51:20,143 --> 00:51:21,143
One at a time.

1316
00:51:21,143 --> 00:51:23,076
What do you think?

1317
00:51:23,076 --> 00:51:26,976
- It does look good. / - Yes! It looks great.

1318
00:51:30,010 --> 00:51:31,343
Okay, it looks perfect now.

1319
00:51:31,343 --> 00:51:32,976
In 1, 2, 3.

1320
00:51:36,943 --> 00:51:42,776
(They enjoy the cool sea breeze)

1321
00:51:43,443 --> 00:51:47,643
(They sail for 20 minutes to see the dolphins)

1322
00:51:48,876 --> 00:51:49,810
Don't people say it looks pretty

1323
00:51:49,810 --> 00:51:50,843
when the hair blows in the wind?

1324
00:51:51,476 --> 00:51:54,943
(What Sook imagined)

1325
00:51:55,476 --> 00:51:56,810
What is wrong with me?

1326
00:51:56,810 --> 00:51:59,843
Actresses look pretty when their hair blows in the wind.

1327
00:52:02,043 --> 00:52:03,643
Hwijae, how do I look?

1328
00:52:05,710 --> 00:52:08,210
I heard it's pretty when the hair blows in the wind.

1329
00:52:08,210 --> 00:52:12,076
(Sook)

1330
00:52:13,943 --> 00:52:16,810
You're just "The Slave Hunters."

1331
00:52:18,543 --> 00:52:19,910
What's with this?

1332
00:52:21,610 --> 00:52:24,710
(They can't wait to see dolphins)

1333
00:52:25,176 --> 00:52:28,610
(One man is nervous)

1334
00:52:29,676 --> 00:52:31,376
If we don't see dolphins, I'll hit you.

1335
00:52:31,376 --> 00:52:32,943
If you don't see dolphins, I'll become one.

1336
00:52:32,943 --> 00:52:35,210
- You have to do the dolphin show. / - Okay, I will.

1337
00:52:35,210 --> 00:52:36,743
We have to see the dolphin.

1338
00:52:36,743 --> 00:52:38,843
(Why did I agree to that?)

1339
00:52:39,176 --> 00:52:40,876
Everyone, we're almost there!

1340
00:52:41,976 --> 00:52:44,943
Everyone, we can see dolphins soon.

1341
00:52:45,876 --> 00:52:48,243
There it is!

1342
00:52:48,243 --> 00:52:50,443
- Where? / - Dolphin! Dolphin!

1343
00:52:50,443 --> 00:52:51,210
Where?

1344
00:52:51,210 --> 00:52:53,676
(The sea looks calm)

1345
00:52:54,043 --> 00:52:55,843
(The video is not paused)

1346
00:52:56,343 --> 00:52:57,643
(Oh, no)

1347
00:52:58,410 --> 00:53:02,343
(1 year ago, Jeju-do host special)

1348
00:53:03,576 --> 00:53:05,010
All I see is seagulls.

1349
00:53:05,010 --> 00:53:07,110
Dolphins, where are you?

1350
00:53:07,110 --> 00:53:09,710
I came to see dolphins.

1351
00:53:10,676 --> 00:53:12,576
(Seagulls again?)

1352
00:53:13,010 --> 00:53:14,943
(What do we do about Hwijae?)

1353
00:53:15,076 --> 00:53:16,376
(Sigh)

1354
00:53:16,643 --> 00:53:18,443
(Solemn)

1355
00:53:18,443 --> 00:53:21,043
Wait? Isn't that a dolphin?

1356
00:53:21,043 --> 00:53:22,410
- Where? Where? / - There!

1357
00:53:24,510 --> 00:53:26,043
- Where? Where? / - There!

1358
00:53:26,543 --> 00:53:28,343
It jumped! It jumped!

1359
00:53:29,176 --> 00:53:30,010
It jumped!

1360
00:53:30,610 --> 00:53:32,510
It jumped! It jumped!

1361
00:53:32,510 --> 00:53:33,543
Did you see?

1362
00:53:34,110 --> 00:53:36,010
- Over there! / - It's jumping!

1363
00:53:36,410 --> 00:53:37,943
- They're right here. / - They are.

1364
00:53:37,943 --> 00:53:40,076
Wow, I see dolphins here.

1365
00:53:40,076 --> 00:53:41,576
- Wow. / - This is no joke.

1366
00:53:41,576 --> 00:53:44,743
- Over here, over here. / - What's going on?

1367
00:53:46,310 --> 00:53:50,143
(It's unbelievable that they're seeing this)

1368
00:53:55,676 --> 00:53:59,443
(A pod of dolphins)

1369
00:53:59,776 --> 00:54:00,743
No way.

1370
00:54:14,643 --> 00:54:16,276
They're coming here. They're coming here.

1371
00:54:16,276 --> 00:54:19,943
(3 dolphins jump out of the water)

1372
00:54:19,943 --> 00:54:20,843
Where are they?

1373
00:54:25,010 --> 00:54:28,543
(Before their very eyes)

1374
00:54:28,543 --> 00:54:32,276
(The dolphins show their new skills)

1375
00:54:35,643 --> 00:54:37,643
They're so adorable.

1376
00:54:39,576 --> 00:54:40,610
They're playing.

1377
00:54:41,776 --> 00:54:44,076
I must be getting old. I'm getting teary.

1378
00:54:45,110 --> 00:54:46,243
You know what I mean, right?

1379
00:54:46,976 --> 00:54:49,376
(Sikyung, don't cry)

1380
00:54:53,676 --> 00:54:57,343
(Before Sikyung cries, they head to the next spot)

1381
00:54:57,743 --> 00:54:59,910
(Fulfilled)

1382
00:55:00,210 --> 00:55:02,576
(The dolphin tour was successful, 5 stars for sure)

1383
00:55:06,210 --> 00:55:10,043
(They head to the fishing spot)

1384
00:55:11,576 --> 00:55:18,310
(In the middle of South Pacific Ocean)

1385
00:55:18,310 --> 00:55:25,043
(They enjoy the leisure of fishing)

1386
00:55:31,010 --> 00:55:33,576
(The sun slowly goes down)

1387
00:55:35,476 --> 00:55:36,843
I'm getting bored now.

1388
00:55:37,276 --> 00:55:40,743
(It's not easy to catch a fish)

1389
00:55:41,043 --> 00:55:43,343
(They've been waiting for 30 minutes without a bite)

1390
00:55:43,343 --> 00:55:45,676
- Who suggested we go fishing? / - I'm Sorry.

1391
00:55:45,676 --> 00:55:48,076
I'm not giving you points for this.

1392
00:55:48,076 --> 00:55:50,543
I give -100 points for fishing.

1393
00:55:50,543 --> 00:55:54,243
Let's try one last time and go snorkeling.

1394
00:55:54,243 --> 00:55:56,776
(They try fishing one last time)

1395
00:55:57,410 --> 00:56:00,210
(Please bite it)

1396
00:56:00,510 --> 00:56:02,410
(Right then!)

1397
00:56:02,410 --> 00:56:03,210
I got one.

1398
00:56:03,843 --> 00:56:04,710
Did you?

1399
00:56:09,143 --> 00:56:10,376
Hey, it's a big one.

1400
00:56:12,543 --> 00:56:14,376
- What is it? / - I don't know.

1401
00:56:15,576 --> 00:56:16,943
Look at the rod bending.

1402
00:56:18,043 --> 00:56:19,743
(It's a sign of a big fish)

1403
00:56:20,543 --> 00:56:21,543
Did you catch it?

1404
00:56:21,543 --> 00:56:24,110
(The rod is bent)

1405
00:56:24,810 --> 00:56:27,410
(Hwijae, I want to eat raw fish)

1406
00:56:27,776 --> 00:56:30,243
(I trust you, Guam professor)

1407
00:56:30,543 --> 00:56:32,076
You caught a rock.

1408
00:56:32,076 --> 00:56:32,776
Really?

1409
00:56:33,343 --> 00:56:34,243
It got caught on a rock.

1410
00:56:34,976 --> 00:56:35,576
Rock?

1411
00:56:35,576 --> 00:56:38,610
(Disappointed)

1412
00:56:40,810 --> 00:56:41,743
What happened?

1413
00:56:44,576 --> 00:56:46,743
What was that? You sounded so confident.

1414
00:56:46,743 --> 00:56:49,143
I haven't been fishing because of the kids.

1415
00:56:51,410 --> 00:56:54,110
(Sikyung has one last try as well)

1416
00:57:02,543 --> 00:57:05,376
(Let's remain calm, it could be a rock)

1417
00:57:05,876 --> 00:57:08,210
(Hesitant)

1418
00:57:08,210 --> 00:57:09,910
- Look at this. / - Did something bite?

1419
00:57:09,910 --> 00:57:10,876
You've got something.

1420
00:57:12,576 --> 00:57:14,676
- Wow! / - What is it?

1421
00:57:15,076 --> 00:57:17,676
(Sikyung did it in the end)

1422
00:57:18,543 --> 00:57:22,376
(They finally caught a fish)

1423
00:57:26,910 --> 00:57:27,910
Really?

1424
00:57:28,510 --> 00:57:30,176
Sikyung, you did it.

1425
00:57:30,176 --> 00:57:31,710
Guam suits Sikyung.

1426
00:57:31,710 --> 00:57:32,943
Let's catch two more of these.

1427
00:57:33,743 --> 00:57:34,876
It wasn't hard.

1428
00:57:35,376 --> 00:57:37,443
Maybe I should be on "The Fishermen and the City."

1429
00:57:37,443 --> 00:57:39,843
Let's go snorkeling. It will make up for this.

1430
00:57:40,810 --> 00:57:42,476
(Snorkeling)

1431
00:57:43,376 --> 00:57:47,076
(The 3 of them get ready for snorkeling)

1432
00:57:50,243 --> 00:57:52,043
I think Sikyung doesn't have to put makeup on.

1433
00:57:54,376 --> 00:57:56,010
Take your sunglasses off, Sikyung.

1434
00:57:56,676 --> 00:57:58,476
I can't tell it's you.

1435
00:57:58,476 --> 00:57:59,476
This won't do.

1436
00:58:00,376 --> 00:58:00,876
This won't do.

1437
00:58:01,710 --> 00:58:04,210
(This is actually Sung Sikyung)

1438
00:58:04,843 --> 00:58:06,576
Sikyung, don't worry.

1439
00:58:06,576 --> 00:58:08,043
- What kind of style? / - Ray-Ban.

1440
00:58:08,043 --> 00:58:08,943
Okay, okay.

1441
00:58:09,810 --> 00:58:14,310
I shouldn't do water sports. Because...

1442
00:58:14,310 --> 00:58:17,743
People don't recognize me if I take off my glasses.

1443
00:58:18,776 --> 00:58:20,043
It will be funnier then.

1444
00:58:20,043 --> 00:58:22,876
Sikyung, I will draw one on your face with a marker.

1445
00:58:22,876 --> 00:58:24,943
I'll draw glasses on your face with a marker

1446
00:58:24,943 --> 00:58:26,843
so you can be comfortable underwater.

1447
00:58:27,276 --> 00:58:29,643
When I was in my 20s, I hated things like this.

1448
00:58:29,643 --> 00:58:32,576
But... I think it'll be alright to draw it on my face.

1449
00:58:33,543 --> 00:58:37,210
I guarantee satisfaction.

1450
00:58:37,210 --> 00:58:39,343
(She tries to make it look like he's wearing glasses)

1451
00:58:43,576 --> 00:58:47,310
Sook, those are some luxury glasses.

1452
00:58:48,143 --> 00:58:50,276
I think Sikyung will hit me.

1453
00:58:51,476 --> 00:58:54,710
Sikyung, you look better than you think actually.

1454
00:58:54,710 --> 00:58:55,843
Let me introduce my first artwork.

1455
00:58:55,843 --> 00:58:57,843
Sung Sikyung and Water Activities.

1456
00:58:58,576 --> 00:58:59,476
Take them off.

1457
00:59:02,243 --> 00:59:06,010
(He finally reveals his face)

1458
00:59:07,976 --> 00:59:13,643
(Amazing)

1459
00:59:14,543 --> 00:59:16,010
- Hey, Sikyung. / - She drew it on so well.

1460
00:59:16,010 --> 00:59:18,243
- I can't tell. / - She did so well.

1461
00:59:18,243 --> 00:59:20,443
- You can't tell at all. / - The glasses are there.

1462
00:59:20,443 --> 00:59:22,676
- They're just glasses. / - They're real glasses.

1463
00:59:22,676 --> 00:59:25,143
Do you want round glasses?

1464
00:59:25,143 --> 00:59:26,176
I have to do it too?

1465
00:59:26,176 --> 00:59:27,910
Of course, you have to take off your glasses.

1466
00:59:29,010 --> 00:59:30,543
Why me as well?

1467
00:59:32,310 --> 00:59:34,143
Let's go with round glasses.

1468
00:59:34,710 --> 00:59:36,443
(She tries to get away)

1469
00:59:36,443 --> 00:59:38,043
(She got caught)

1470
00:59:38,043 --> 00:59:40,110
But I don't wear glasses.

1471
00:59:43,643 --> 00:59:44,943
I like it.

1472
00:59:44,943 --> 00:59:46,410
- That's good then. / - I like it.

1473
00:59:46,410 --> 00:59:47,410
I'm happy.

1474
00:59:48,776 --> 00:59:49,876
Let's go.

1475
00:59:49,876 --> 00:59:52,243
Why did I start this?

1476
00:59:54,510 --> 00:59:56,910
(It's now time to enjoy the ocean)

1477
00:59:58,743 --> 01:00:02,210
(Hwijae goes into the water first)

1478
01:00:04,176 --> 01:00:07,043
(Sikyung joins as well)

1479
01:00:09,010 --> 01:00:10,243
Let's go, Sikyung.

1480
01:00:11,543 --> 01:00:12,410
Let's go, Sikyung.

1481
01:00:12,410 --> 01:00:13,976
Sikyung, I will go catch some fish.

1482
01:00:13,976 --> 01:00:15,810
Brother, how is it living off the grid?

1483
01:00:16,576 --> 01:00:19,376
I've been living off the ocean and nature

1484
01:00:19,376 --> 01:00:22,176
here in Guam for...

1485
01:00:22,176 --> 01:00:23,710
(Cracking up because of Sook)

1486
01:00:23,710 --> 01:00:26,143
20 some years now.

1487
01:00:27,743 --> 01:00:31,076
20 some years now. Living off the grid.

1488
01:00:31,076 --> 01:00:33,176
I'll go and catch some fish.

1489
01:00:33,176 --> 01:00:34,943
Can you come in now so I can get out?

1490
01:00:36,110 --> 01:00:38,076
(20 years in Guam but still scared of the water)

1491
01:00:38,076 --> 01:00:40,776
It's cold! It's so cold.

1492
01:00:41,643 --> 01:00:42,410
It's so cold.

1493
01:00:42,410 --> 01:00:44,876
(Okay)

1494
01:00:46,143 --> 01:00:49,943
(Everyone is in the water now)

1495
01:00:52,410 --> 01:00:55,643
(Inside the South Pacific Ocean)

1496
01:00:55,643 --> 01:00:58,843
(With crystal clear water)

1497
01:00:58,843 --> 01:01:04,443
(They relax and watch the fish)

1498
01:01:20,976 --> 01:01:23,910
(So excited)

1499
01:01:25,910 --> 01:01:29,276
(Hwijae is getting ready to dive)

1500
01:01:29,610 --> 01:01:31,776
Are you going to dive? Go on.

1501
01:01:36,210 --> 01:01:40,210
(Hwijae is showing off his swimming skills)

1502
01:01:41,976 --> 01:01:43,576
You're like a mermaid.

1503
01:01:44,443 --> 01:01:46,310
You were really beautiful.

1504
01:01:46,910 --> 01:01:51,843
(They are enjoying and relaxing in the sea)

1505
01:01:58,876 --> 01:02:01,576
(They head back after they complete the day's activities)

1506
01:02:02,143 --> 01:02:06,510
(Making raw fish with Sikyung's catch)

1507
01:02:13,510 --> 01:02:15,710
(Precious)

1508
01:02:16,210 --> 01:02:18,510
If we'd caught one each...

1509
01:02:18,510 --> 01:02:19,710
This is enough.

1510
01:02:19,710 --> 01:02:21,510
This is worthy of "The Fisherman and the City."

1511
01:02:21,510 --> 01:02:23,176
You'll get sick if you eat too much.

1512
01:02:23,876 --> 01:02:26,010
- Let's have a drink first. / - Good work.

1513
01:02:26,010 --> 01:02:28,510
- Good work, everyone. / - Please score generously.

1514
01:02:29,343 --> 01:02:30,376
It's good.

1515
01:02:30,976 --> 01:02:32,376
I think it tastes better than Jeju-do.

1516
01:02:33,110 --> 01:02:35,543
- I can't believe this. / - What is this?

1517
01:02:35,543 --> 01:02:37,710
It's so chewy.

1518
01:02:38,876 --> 01:02:41,343
- It's clean and sweet. / - Oh, my.

1519
01:02:41,343 --> 01:02:43,076
(Tastes clean and sweet because they caught it)

1520
01:02:45,743 --> 01:02:48,510
- This is it. / - I've lived in Guam for 15 years for this.

1521
01:02:48,976 --> 01:02:50,710
Guam is so nice.

1522
01:02:52,910 --> 01:02:55,443
Sir, what's your English name here?

1523
01:02:55,443 --> 01:02:58,943
I'm known as Nanda Kim here.

1524
01:03:02,343 --> 01:03:03,976
Are you okay?

1525
01:03:04,976 --> 01:03:08,543
I can't believe that Battle Trip came to Guam.

1526
01:03:10,710 --> 01:03:13,843
I'm so thankful. Please promote Guam a lot.

1527
01:03:13,843 --> 01:03:15,176
Tell them who good Guam is.

1528
01:03:15,176 --> 01:03:15,943
- Sir. / - Sook.

1529
01:03:15,943 --> 01:03:17,910
I heard you live under here.

1530
01:03:17,910 --> 01:03:19,110
You just live here.

1531
01:03:19,110 --> 01:03:22,476
- I'll get going now. / - She lives with the Dragon King.

1532
01:03:23,143 --> 01:03:25,510
(Sook is so funny)

1533
01:03:30,610 --> 01:03:32,076
You're enjoying it so much.

1534
01:03:32,076 --> 01:03:33,443
- It's so good. / - It's so good.

1535
01:03:33,443 --> 01:03:34,943
The fish itself is so good.

1536
01:03:34,943 --> 01:03:36,676
It tastes good after playing in the water.

1537
01:03:36,676 --> 01:03:38,443
Can't we buy some more fish?

1538
01:03:38,443 --> 01:03:40,343
We can buy it at the supermarket.

1539
01:03:41,043 --> 01:03:43,310
Sikyung, let's fish more.

1540
01:03:43,310 --> 01:03:45,043
Sikyung, let's do some more fishing.

1541
01:03:46,176 --> 01:03:48,476
How much is this course?

1542
01:03:48,476 --> 01:03:50,376
How much for a family of four?

1543
01:03:50,376 --> 01:03:51,610
$180.00

1544
01:03:51,610 --> 01:03:53,610
$50 for adults. $40 for children.

1545
01:03:53,610 --> 01:03:55,410
If you convert that to the Korean currency,

1546
01:03:55,410 --> 01:03:58,076
that's between 50,000 to 60,000 KRW.

1547
01:03:58,076 --> 01:04:00,510
That's a good price.

1548
01:04:00,510 --> 01:04:01,943
- It's a great price. / - Yeah.

1549
01:04:01,943 --> 01:04:03,243
How many points should we give this?

1550
01:04:04,876 --> 01:04:05,710
Sir.

1551
01:04:07,076 --> 01:04:08,176
For me...

1552
01:04:09,276 --> 01:04:11,310
The dolphin tour...

1553
01:04:11,310 --> 01:04:13,943
I will give it 5 out of 5 points.

1554
01:04:14,376 --> 01:04:16,910
But I deduct 5 points for the fishing.

1555
01:04:17,643 --> 01:04:20,076
You have to catch the fish to be fun.

1556
01:04:20,076 --> 01:04:23,076
So it's zero but then for snorkeling.

1557
01:04:23,743 --> 01:04:25,443
If you include snorkeling

1558
01:04:25,443 --> 01:04:27,976
and eating the fish we caught...

1559
01:04:27,976 --> 01:04:29,776
- I give this... / - Out of 5.

1560
01:04:30,976 --> 01:04:32,943
5 points.

1561
01:04:34,176 --> 01:04:35,010
Yeah!

1562
01:04:35,476 --> 01:04:36,276
Full score.

1563
01:04:38,710 --> 01:04:39,643
Sikyung.

1564
01:04:39,976 --> 01:04:42,276
I almost cried because of the dolphins.

1565
01:04:42,276 --> 01:04:43,976
- He's going to give a full score. / - The dolphins are...

1566
01:04:43,976 --> 01:04:47,410
Very interesting to humans.

1567
01:04:47,410 --> 01:04:50,110
Their existence is so grateful yet heart breaking.

1568
01:04:50,110 --> 01:04:54,243
For me, I think you must come here with family.

1569
01:04:54,243 --> 01:04:55,043
It's a must.

1570
01:04:55,043 --> 01:04:56,910
When the dolphins jumped,

1571
01:04:56,910 --> 01:04:58,443
I really thought of Seoeon and Seojun.

1572
01:04:58,443 --> 01:04:59,910
Even if you couldn't catch any fish...

1573
01:04:59,910 --> 01:05:04,376
Just being able to enjoy this sunset with your family...

1574
01:05:04,376 --> 01:05:05,243
This deserves 5 points.

1575
01:05:05,243 --> 01:05:07,210
So 5 points.

1576
01:05:09,110 --> 01:05:10,943
(Cheer)

1577
01:05:10,943 --> 01:05:13,810
If you get lucky and catch something like this...

1578
01:05:13,810 --> 01:05:15,376
- That's amazing. / - That'd be 10 out of 10.

1579
01:05:15,376 --> 01:05:19,043
Since the sun is setting, we need to have dinner.

1580
01:05:19,043 --> 01:05:19,843
- Aren't you hungry? / - Normally...

1581
01:05:19,843 --> 01:05:22,076
- Yes, after being in the water. / - You are, right?

1582
01:05:22,076 --> 01:05:24,910
We ate something greasy earlier.

1583
01:05:24,910 --> 01:05:26,876
We will get rid of that greasiness now.

1584
01:05:26,876 --> 01:05:28,676
- Let's go. Okay? / - Let's go.

1585
01:05:28,676 --> 01:05:31,243
I'll travel by water.

1586
01:05:31,243 --> 01:05:32,576
- Sir. / - You can ride the boat.

1587
01:05:32,576 --> 01:05:34,110
But you have bad knees.

1588
01:05:34,110 --> 01:05:36,076
I hear your Korean name is Dragon King.

1589
01:05:36,076 --> 01:05:36,943
I'll leave first.

1590
01:05:36,943 --> 01:05:38,076
Stop it, sir.

1591
01:05:44,143 --> 01:05:46,976
(Good restaurant certified by Hwijae)

1592
01:05:47,443 --> 01:05:49,676
We'll be in trouble if we go here.

1593
01:05:49,676 --> 01:05:51,476
We'll gain 3kg here.

1594
01:05:51,476 --> 01:05:53,210
- Thai? / - That looks so good.

1595
01:05:53,210 --> 01:05:54,843
I've been to this restaurant twice.

1596
01:05:54,843 --> 01:05:56,276
- Because it was so good? / - I love it so much.

1597
01:05:56,276 --> 01:05:57,676
- Really? / - It's so delicious.

1598
01:05:58,876 --> 01:06:01,776
(It's time to go to dinner where they will fall in love)

1599
01:06:03,276 --> 01:06:05,476
- Is it Thai food? / - Yes, it's Thai.

1600
01:06:05,476 --> 01:06:07,910
Do you want something refreshing?

1601
01:06:07,910 --> 01:06:08,910
I want something refreshing.

1602
01:06:08,910 --> 01:06:10,043
- Do you want it? / - Yes.

1603
01:06:10,043 --> 01:06:13,643
- It's salty and sweet. / - Give me alcohol.

1604
01:06:13,643 --> 01:06:16,810
- Why is he acting like this? / - His nose is burnt.

1605
01:06:17,843 --> 01:06:20,576
I thought he was a Guam drunkard.

1606
01:06:20,576 --> 01:06:21,843
How could my nose burn like this?

1607
01:06:21,843 --> 01:06:25,443
This place is really recognized

1608
01:06:25,443 --> 01:06:27,910
for its Thai food in Guam.

1609
01:06:27,910 --> 01:06:31,710
Over there. You know the review...

1610
01:06:31,710 --> 01:06:33,643
2014, 2015, 2016, 2017.

1611
01:06:33,643 --> 01:06:34,643
They won awards each year.

1612
01:06:36,876 --> 01:06:38,376
- Let's go in. / - Let's go.

1613
01:06:38,710 --> 01:06:41,043
I'm looking forward to it. I love places like this.

1614
01:06:44,376 --> 01:06:47,976
(Many people chose this as their favorite restaurant)

1615
01:06:50,776 --> 01:06:51,676
Pick one each.

1616
01:06:52,410 --> 01:06:54,710
What is this? They all look good.

1617
01:06:55,976 --> 01:06:57,843
- Here... / - How can we only choose one?

1618
01:06:57,843 --> 01:07:00,443
(That's impossible)

1619
01:07:00,443 --> 01:07:01,743
(If we had to choose one)

1620
01:07:01,743 --> 01:07:03,576
I want this interesting looking one.

1621
01:07:04,010 --> 01:07:04,743
What?

1622
01:07:05,610 --> 01:07:07,510
Northern Thailand sausage.

1623
01:07:07,510 --> 01:07:08,576
Will it be okay for you?

1624
01:07:10,076 --> 01:07:11,476
Northern Thailand sausage...

1625
01:07:11,476 --> 01:07:13,176
And spring rolls.

1626
01:07:13,176 --> 01:07:15,443
I'll choose the curry.

1627
01:07:15,443 --> 01:07:18,976
- Which curry? / - Just the standard red curry.

1628
01:07:18,976 --> 01:07:20,076
- Red curry. / - Okay.

1629
01:07:20,076 --> 01:07:22,243
Let's order this first and order more later.

1630
01:07:22,243 --> 01:07:23,943
No. We have to order this.

1631
01:07:23,943 --> 01:07:24,710
What is it?

1632
01:07:25,443 --> 01:07:27,176
Vietnamese fried catfish.

1633
01:07:27,876 --> 01:07:28,343
Hwijae.

1634
01:07:28,343 --> 01:07:29,510
- Shouldn't we order this? / - Don't eat catfish.

1635
01:07:29,510 --> 01:07:31,610
- Let's eat that later. / - Please order it for me.

1636
01:07:32,010 --> 01:07:33,843
- Let's eat that later. / - Please order it for me.

1637
01:07:33,843 --> 01:07:36,710
- Shouldn't we have some fried rice? / - Okay then.

1638
01:07:36,710 --> 01:07:39,143
- Let's eat this first. / - Let's order fried rice.

1639
01:07:39,143 --> 01:07:41,143
The curry comes with rice.

1640
01:07:41,143 --> 01:07:43,843
- Let's order the fried rice later. / - Okay.

1641
01:07:44,310 --> 01:07:45,443
- We're ready to order. / - Sure.

1642
01:07:47,176 --> 01:07:50,643
Spring roll and Thai sausage...

1643
01:07:55,276 --> 01:07:56,843
Is this our first order?

1644
01:07:56,843 --> 01:07:59,510
This is for the first round.

1645
01:08:00,410 --> 01:08:02,176
And the second round is coming.

1646
01:08:02,710 --> 01:08:04,610
(Unbelievable)

1647
01:08:06,610 --> 01:08:10,676
(Countless food to stimulate the appetite)

1648
01:08:12,510 --> 01:08:15,343
(It's $69.90 in total)

1649
01:08:16,876 --> 01:08:19,743
(The first dish is here)

1650
01:08:21,143 --> 01:08:26,410
(Fried spring rolls, $7.50)

1651
01:08:27,743 --> 01:08:29,543
(Crispy)

1652
01:08:37,243 --> 01:08:38,910
She looks the same when she's scared and hungry.

1653
01:08:38,910 --> 01:08:41,376
- The face from the Slingshot. / - It's the same.

1654
01:08:41,376 --> 01:08:42,710
Same as when she's angry...

1655
01:08:42,710 --> 01:08:45,043
(It really is the same)

1656
01:08:45,043 --> 01:08:46,076
It's the same.

1657
01:08:46,076 --> 01:08:48,010
It's the same when she's scared and when it's delicious.

1658
01:08:48,010 --> 01:08:49,943
It's so good.

1659
01:08:50,943 --> 01:08:52,010
I'll try one too.

1660
01:08:52,010 --> 01:08:53,276
Want to join me, Sikyung?

1661
01:08:53,876 --> 01:08:56,676
(Will it suit their taste?)

1662
01:08:58,810 --> 01:09:01,643
(They both admire it at once)

1663
01:09:01,643 --> 01:09:03,076
It's fried well.

1664
01:09:03,976 --> 01:09:05,310
I can taste a lot of vegetables.

1665
01:09:05,310 --> 01:09:07,710
- What's important is... / - It tastes clean.

1666
01:09:07,710 --> 01:09:10,276
The skin is so thin and crispy.

1667
01:09:11,776 --> 01:09:13,610
(Satisfied)

1668
01:09:13,976 --> 01:09:15,243
What is this sauce?

1669
01:09:15,243 --> 01:09:16,810
It's Tom yum.

1670
01:09:17,176 --> 01:09:19,443
Tom yum Goong. Tom yum Goong.

1671
01:09:19,443 --> 01:09:22,943
(Battle Trip hosts' favorite, Tom yum Goong)

1672
01:09:23,543 --> 01:09:27,010
I want to boil up a load of Tom yum Goong

1673
01:09:27,010 --> 01:09:29,010
and bathe in it.

1674
01:09:30,176 --> 01:09:32,676
(It's so refreshing)

1675
01:09:32,676 --> 01:09:34,476
I want to order a lot of Tom yum Goong

1676
01:09:34,476 --> 01:09:37,210
and massage my face with it.

1677
01:09:37,210 --> 01:09:40,110
(Don't eat it, give it to your skin)

1678
01:09:40,110 --> 01:09:42,276
(It's time to eat Tom yum Goong, the best of Thai food)

1679
01:09:43,043 --> 01:09:46,176
(Shrimp Tom yum Goong, $14.50)

1680
01:09:51,543 --> 01:09:52,310
It's good.

1681
01:09:52,310 --> 01:09:53,610
This restaurant makes really good Tom yum Goong.

1682
01:09:53,610 --> 01:09:54,776
It's very sour.

1683
01:09:54,776 --> 01:09:57,476
(They reenacted the delicious taste of Thailand)

1684
01:09:57,476 --> 01:09:58,576
For people who enjoy Thai food,

1685
01:09:58,576 --> 01:10:00,576
they should season it stronger.

1686
01:10:00,976 --> 01:10:02,843
Seoeon and Seojun will like this.

1687
01:10:04,343 --> 01:10:06,743
I'll show you how I eat it.

1688
01:10:06,743 --> 01:10:08,876
I don't add the ingredients.

1689
01:10:08,876 --> 01:10:11,210
I just grab one shrimp.

1690
01:10:15,310 --> 01:10:17,543
(Cilantro)

1691
01:10:17,543 --> 01:10:18,810
I eat it like this.

1692
01:10:20,143 --> 01:10:24,076
(How will it taste with this much cilantro?)

1693
01:10:27,210 --> 01:10:30,243
(This is it)

1694
01:10:30,910 --> 01:10:32,010
Are you satisfied?

1695
01:10:32,510 --> 01:10:33,610
I love it.

1696
01:10:34,776 --> 01:10:38,443
(Sikyung also tries a bite)

1697
01:10:40,010 --> 01:10:41,443
(Completely approved)

1698
01:10:41,443 --> 01:10:42,643
This is my taste.

1699
01:10:42,643 --> 01:10:44,676
It isn't bad.

1700
01:10:45,976 --> 01:10:48,643
The red curry chicken.

1701
01:10:48,643 --> 01:10:51,443
(Another dish, the red curry)

1702
01:10:53,843 --> 01:10:56,643
(Chicken red curry, $11)

1703
01:10:56,643 --> 01:10:57,843
Goodness.

1704
01:10:58,410 --> 01:11:00,410
It looks more delicious than it looks.

1705
01:11:00,410 --> 01:11:02,076
It doesn't look spicy.

1706
01:11:02,076 --> 01:11:03,310
How is it?

1707
01:11:04,176 --> 01:11:06,610
Tom yum Goong.

1708
01:11:10,176 --> 01:11:14,443
(Sook, this is it)

1709
01:11:15,476 --> 01:11:17,710
We would've regretted it if we didn't order this.

1710
01:11:18,110 --> 01:11:21,576
Completely different from the curry we usually eat.

1711
01:11:21,576 --> 01:11:24,843
And it's different from Indian curry.

1712
01:11:27,176 --> 01:11:29,276
- It's not spicy. / - Are you sure?

1713
01:11:31,776 --> 01:11:32,676
Try it with some rice.

1714
01:11:34,843 --> 01:11:36,710
It might be difficult for you.

1715
01:11:39,210 --> 01:11:40,976
- It's so good. / - So good.

1716
01:11:41,743 --> 01:11:46,576
It's the level of spiciness that Koreans love.

1717
01:11:48,410 --> 01:11:49,343
Try it with rice.

1718
01:11:52,976 --> 01:11:54,243
I'm dying here.

1719
01:11:55,043 --> 01:11:56,510
It's so good.

1720
01:11:57,776 --> 01:12:00,243
This is a really good kind of spicy.

1721
01:12:02,043 --> 01:12:03,610
Why are they so fast?

1722
01:12:04,043 --> 01:12:06,343
The last dish is the white pepper fish.

1723
01:12:06,343 --> 01:12:07,876
- Okay. / - Wow.

1724
01:12:09,810 --> 01:12:12,643
(It's Sikyung's recommended dish, deep-fried catfish)

1725
01:12:13,243 --> 01:12:15,910
(Deep-fried catfish with white pepper, $12.50)

1726
01:12:16,310 --> 01:12:18,176
It smells great already.

1727
01:12:19,643 --> 01:12:22,276
(How will this unfamiliar dish taste?)

1728
01:12:24,376 --> 01:12:27,410
Come on.

1729
01:12:27,410 --> 01:12:28,843
Come on.

1730
01:12:29,510 --> 01:12:32,810
(Just try it with no doubt)

1731
01:12:32,810 --> 01:12:35,110
When the meat starts to crumble...

1732
01:12:36,676 --> 01:12:39,810
This is the best fish I've ever tried.

1733
01:12:39,810 --> 01:12:41,176
Is this catfish?

1734
01:12:43,243 --> 01:12:45,143
- It's so tender. / - Look at the meat.

1735
01:12:45,143 --> 01:12:47,643
(Plump)

1736
01:12:49,443 --> 01:12:52,410
This is the best fish I've ever tried.

1737
01:12:52,410 --> 01:12:53,543
I'm sure this is

1738
01:12:53,543 --> 01:12:55,410
one of the top 3 dishes of this restaurant.

1739
01:12:55,910 --> 01:12:57,276
This isn't catfish.

1740
01:12:57,876 --> 01:12:59,410
It's chicken.

1741
01:13:01,010 --> 01:13:03,210
- It's here. / - It's the Thai sausage.

1742
01:13:03,843 --> 01:13:06,810
(Here comes a new challenge, Thai sausage)

1743
01:13:08,110 --> 01:13:11,676
(What does it taste like?)

1744
01:13:12,043 --> 01:13:14,576
I'll try this interesting dish, the Thai sausage.

1745
01:13:15,143 --> 01:13:16,576
- Will it be okay? / - How is it?

1746
01:13:16,576 --> 01:13:18,543
It's Northern Thai sausage.

1747
01:13:18,776 --> 01:13:20,410
Deep-fried squid is just common.

1748
01:13:20,410 --> 01:13:22,043
And skewers are just average.

1749
01:13:25,910 --> 01:13:28,510
This isn't my thing. Gosh, Sikyung.

1750
01:13:31,810 --> 01:13:34,110
(What's wrong with her?)

1751
01:13:34,676 --> 01:13:36,410
I told you to trust me.

1752
01:13:36,410 --> 01:13:37,876
Just trust me.

1753
01:13:38,310 --> 01:13:39,110
It's delicious.

1754
01:13:42,510 --> 01:13:43,310
It's great.

1755
01:13:43,310 --> 01:13:45,210
(This is it)

1756
01:13:45,210 --> 01:13:48,110
The aftertaste is a very spicy cold blood sausage.

1757
01:13:48,110 --> 01:13:49,476
It's more like spicy beef soup.

1758
01:13:49,476 --> 01:13:52,043
It tastes much like Philippine sausage.

1759
01:13:54,476 --> 01:13:55,810
This is amazing.

1760
01:13:56,310 --> 01:13:57,843
This is harmonious.

1761
01:13:57,843 --> 01:14:00,376
- It's not too spicy. It's just good. / - Yeah.

1762
01:14:00,376 --> 01:14:02,810
Imagine if we didn't order the Northern Thai sausage.

1763
01:14:02,810 --> 01:14:05,143
- It'd be too dull. / - It was a must.

1764
01:14:05,143 --> 01:14:06,243
It's really good, right?

1765
01:14:07,543 --> 01:14:08,676
I'm happy.

1766
01:14:10,076 --> 01:14:11,710
Let me focus on eating now.

1767
01:14:11,710 --> 01:14:12,743
What?

1768
01:14:14,143 --> 01:14:14,976
What did you say?

1769
01:14:14,976 --> 01:14:17,510
(It's time for them to eat properly)

1770
01:14:25,010 --> 01:14:26,243
Do we score it now?

1771
01:14:26,243 --> 01:14:28,310
- I already did at the start. / -  How much?

1772
01:14:28,310 --> 01:14:30,643
- The second I stepped in. / - 5 points?

1773
01:14:30,643 --> 01:14:33,543
- What about you, Sikyung? / - I think this place is Guam.

1774
01:14:33,543 --> 01:14:36,943
(There's no need to explain further)

1775
01:14:38,110 --> 01:14:39,510
This is Guam.

1776
01:14:39,510 --> 01:14:41,776
This place is Guam to me.

1777
01:14:43,743 --> 01:14:47,376
Let's calculate the expenses for today.

1778
01:14:47,376 --> 01:14:50,510
The breakfast we had was $64.

1779
01:14:51,976 --> 01:14:54,710
Slingshot was $25 per person.

1780
01:14:55,676 --> 01:14:58,810
And the dolphin cruise was $54 per person.

1781
01:15:00,810 --> 01:15:04,276
($27 per person for the Thai dinner)

1782
01:15:04,710 --> 01:15:07,576
(The total is $480 per person including accommodation)

1783
01:15:08,276 --> 01:15:10,143
I want to try other dishes.

1784
01:15:10,543 --> 01:15:12,910
(What? Aren't they done yet?)

1785
01:15:14,843 --> 01:15:16,110
It's that good.

1786
01:15:20,243 --> 01:15:22,043
Order green papaya salad.

1787
01:15:22,643 --> 01:15:24,210
Order green papaya salad.

1788
01:15:25,676 --> 01:15:31,910
(And that's how they began round 2)

1789
01:15:33,010 --> 01:15:35,543
Hwijae, go and enjoy the shooting range.

1790
01:15:35,543 --> 01:15:37,310
We'll start round 2.

1791
01:15:38,476 --> 01:15:39,443
Come on.

1792
01:15:39,443 --> 01:15:41,076
(Hwijae actually went to the shooting range)

1793
01:15:41,076 --> 01:15:42,976
I'm so happy.

1794
01:15:47,676 --> 01:15:49,743
Fathers exhausted from babysitting.

1795
01:15:50,710 --> 01:15:51,543
Challenge!

1796
01:15:53,110 --> 01:15:57,243
(Meanwhile, Sook and Sikyung finished the 2nd round)

1797
01:15:58,110 --> 01:15:59,510
There will be a book for our 2-year anniversary.

1798
01:15:59,510 --> 01:16:02,776
- So many good things are happening. / - Battle Trip?

1799
01:16:03,943 --> 01:16:04,910
Now that the book is out,

1800
