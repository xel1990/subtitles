00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:04,340
(Numerous great tips on trips)

2
00:00:05,473 --> 00:00:07,340
(Kim Sook, Sung Sikyung)

3
00:00:08,173 --> 00:00:10,173
(Lee Hwijae, special host, Lee Hyejung)

4
00:00:11,273 --> 00:00:12,607
Travel is war.

5
00:00:12,607 --> 00:00:15,173
Battle Trip.

6
00:00:17,107 --> 00:00:20,273
Today's special host is Lee Hyejung.

7
00:00:20,273 --> 00:00:21,207
Welcome.

8
00:00:21,207 --> 00:00:23,273
Hello, I'm a model, Lee Hyejung.

9
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:26,040
I really wanted to be on Battle Trip,

10
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:28,040
and I've said that over and over again.

11
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:30,040
And I watched the episode with Song Vacation.

12
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:32,073
- That's right. / - I cried while watching it.

13
00:00:32,473 --> 00:00:34,540
If I have a chance,

14
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:37,207
I want to be here again as a trip planner.

15
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:39,273
Do you like to travel?

16
00:00:39,273 --> 00:00:40,740
Do you travel with your husband?

17
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:43,707
I must say we have itchy feet.

18
00:00:43,707 --> 00:00:45,540
We love to travel so much.

19
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:47,640
For example, last year,

20
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:49,540
we went to Iceland for a month to celebrate

21
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:52,307
our wedding anniversary.

22
00:00:52,307 --> 00:00:53,473
For a month?

23
00:00:53,473 --> 00:00:55,107
Is Iceland very popular these days?

24
00:00:55,107 --> 00:00:56,507
You can become one with nature.

25
00:00:56,507 --> 00:00:57,907
I've been told you can enjoy Mother Nature.

26
00:00:57,907 --> 00:00:58,873
Right. It was great.

27
00:00:58,873 --> 00:01:00,073
And it's very boring.

28
00:01:00,873 --> 00:01:02,473
- I'm serious. / - I know what you mean.

29
00:01:02,473 --> 00:01:03,873
It's good, but boring.

30
00:01:03,873 --> 00:01:05,540
It's perfect for newlyweds.

31
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:07,607
- Because they have love. / - That's right.

32
00:01:07,607 --> 00:01:10,007
Alright. Today's theme is...

33
00:01:10,007 --> 00:01:12,040
- About marriage, right? / - That's right.

34
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:13,173
What is today's theme?

35
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,440
(There's a married couple, bored with everyday routine)

36
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:19,707
There's Hwijae.

37
00:01:19,707 --> 00:01:22,207
(Restless days of child-rearing)

38
00:01:22,207 --> 00:01:24,173
(And endless house chores)

39
00:01:24,707 --> 00:01:27,740
(They need a break)

40
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:30,607
(Forget about the daily life and get away together)

41
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,440
Forget about the daily life.

42
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:35,573
We had a special episode for married couples before.

43
00:01:35,573 --> 00:01:36,673
Park Jiyoon.

44
00:01:37,107 --> 00:01:39,640
- It was very fun. / - Jiyoon's trip was really hard.

45
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:40,807
She took too many photos.

46
00:01:40,907 --> 00:01:42,373
(Romantic getaways for married couples)

47
00:01:42,373 --> 00:01:43,807
- That's right. / - I'm so excited.

48
00:01:43,807 --> 00:01:46,773
Once people get married and have children,

49
00:01:46,773 --> 00:01:48,540
they mostly go on family trips.

50
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:50,307
They don't have many chances to go

51
00:01:50,307 --> 00:01:51,207
on a romantic getaway.

52
00:01:51,207 --> 00:01:53,340
Hwijae always says he wants to go

53
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:55,107
on a trip alone without the kids.

54
00:01:55,107 --> 00:01:57,207
Don't you want to go on a trip with your wife alone?

55
00:01:57,207 --> 00:01:58,540
Of course I do.

56
00:01:58,540 --> 00:02:00,173
- We have a plan to do that in October. / - Really?

57
00:02:00,173 --> 00:02:03,173
I guess it's hard to go on a trip with children.

58
00:02:03,173 --> 00:02:05,873
We don't even call it a trip.

59
00:02:05,873 --> 00:02:06,940
When we travel with our children,

60
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:09,407
we call it training.

61
00:02:09,407 --> 00:02:11,240
It's more like training when your kids are around.

62
00:02:11,573 --> 00:02:13,307
It's more like ranger training.

63
00:02:13,307 --> 00:02:15,440
Hyejung, it must be the perfect time for you to travel.

64
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,573
A lot of my seniors who are married told me that.

65
00:02:17,573 --> 00:02:19,473
We should travel as much as possible

66
00:02:19,473 --> 00:02:21,807
before having kids.

67
00:02:22,173 --> 00:02:24,873
So, today's theme is getaways for married couples.

68
00:02:24,873 --> 00:02:27,940
We have two married couples for today's theme.

69
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:30,740
I wonder who went where.

70
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:32,507
Here are today's trip planners.

71
00:02:32,507 --> 00:02:34,140
- Welcome. / - Welcome.

72
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:35,773
(Who are today's trip planners?)

73
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:37,173
Wow.

74
00:02:38,473 --> 00:02:40,340
(Paeng Hyeonsuk, Choi Yangrak)

75
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:43,040
(Kim Yuna, Kim Hyungkyu)

76
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,107
Nice to meet you.

77
00:02:44,107 --> 00:02:45,407
We have a special episode today.

78
00:02:45,407 --> 00:02:47,073
Choi Yangrak and Paeng Hyeonsuk are

79
00:02:47,073 --> 00:02:48,473
the very first comedian couple in the country.

80
00:02:48,473 --> 00:02:51,173
- That's right. / - I'm sure their trip will be fun.

81
00:02:51,173 --> 00:02:53,307
- I'm excited. / - It was a lot of fun.

82
00:02:53,307 --> 00:02:55,173
How long have you been married?

83
00:02:55,173 --> 00:02:58,073
It's been 3 years now.

84
00:02:58,073 --> 00:02:58,973
- Oh, that's not it. / - What?

85
00:02:58,973 --> 00:03:00,440
- 30 years. / - Right, 30 years.

86
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:02,973
- 30 years? / - Did you say 30 years?

87
00:03:02,973 --> 00:03:04,140
We've been married for 30 years,

88
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:05,107
but it feels like it's been three years.

89
00:03:05,107 --> 00:03:06,940
Time went by so fast.

90
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:08,540
I'm so happy every day.

91
00:03:09,873 --> 00:03:11,007
Every day.

92
00:03:11,007 --> 00:03:12,640
- I can feel the love between them. / - That's right.

93
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:15,873
Yuna and Hyungkyu, what about you?

94
00:03:15,873 --> 00:03:18,873
We've been married for 13 years.

95
00:03:19,307 --> 00:03:21,773
But they look like newlyweds.

96
00:03:21,773 --> 00:03:23,573
- It looks like they're still dating. / - Right?

97
00:03:23,573 --> 00:03:24,740
It's like they're still dating.

98
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:26,207
It's been 13 years though.

99
00:03:26,207 --> 00:03:28,907
We are just like best friends.

100
00:03:28,907 --> 00:03:32,473
It feels like I married a friend

101
00:03:32,473 --> 00:03:34,107
who really hit it off with me.

102
00:03:34,107 --> 00:03:36,240
- I'm so envious. / - It's very fun every day.

103
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:37,773
He's funny.

104
00:03:37,773 --> 00:03:39,607
I guess that's why...

105
00:03:39,607 --> 00:03:41,540
That's because Hyungkyu is handsome.

106
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:43,040
- Thank you. / - So his wife doesn't get old.

107
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:45,507
But my husband has really aged.

108
00:03:45,507 --> 00:03:46,907
- Hyeonsuk. / - He's like a grandfather.

109
00:03:46,907 --> 00:03:48,640
You haven't aged at all.

110
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:51,507
I'm still look young but my husband looks so old.

111
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:55,307
How did you two start dating?

112
00:03:55,307 --> 00:03:58,073
In 1997,

113
00:03:58,073 --> 00:04:00,907
we met at a fashion show for the first time.

114
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:02,407
I fell in love

115
00:04:02,407 --> 00:04:04,140
with her at first sight.

116
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:05,907
It felt like a halo appeared

117
00:04:05,907 --> 00:04:07,940
around her head.

118
00:04:08,407 --> 00:04:11,040
She was like a goddess from up above.

119
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,140
He was blinded by love.

120
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:14,773
I had this feeling

121
00:04:14,773 --> 00:04:17,440
that I would eventually marry her.

122
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:18,440
- Really? / - Yes.

123
00:04:18,607 --> 00:04:19,873
So...

124
00:04:19,873 --> 00:04:21,773
- He sounds so confident. / - It's not that.

125
00:04:22,273 --> 00:04:24,040
So we met there

126
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:26,040
and started talking about comics...

127
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:26,907
They love comics.

128
00:04:26,907 --> 00:04:28,240
- We talked about comics. / - For 2 hours.

129
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,707
- For 2 hours? / - Yes.

130
00:04:29,707 --> 00:04:30,940
It's fate.

131
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:32,707
It was a fateful encounter.

132
00:04:32,973 --> 00:04:34,740
- What a story. / - I'm actually...

133
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:36,573
Excited to watch their trips.

134
00:04:36,573 --> 00:04:39,107
I think their trips will be quite different.

135
00:04:39,107 --> 00:04:41,107
The comedian couple

136
00:04:41,107 --> 00:04:44,940
would squabble during their trip like our parents do.

137
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:46,507
- That's right. / - Meanwhile...

138
00:04:46,507 --> 00:04:49,307
They'll be like newlyweds and best friends.

139
00:04:49,307 --> 00:04:52,307
- They would really hit it off. / - I'm so excited.

140
00:04:52,307 --> 00:04:53,907
- I can't wait. / - Alright. First...

141
00:04:53,907 --> 00:04:56,273
Where did Choi Yangrak and Paeng Hyeonsuk

142
00:04:56,273 --> 00:04:58,573
go for their romantic getaway?

143
00:04:58,573 --> 00:04:59,840
Where did you go?

144
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:02,773
We went to the jewel of Southeast Asia.

145
00:05:02,773 --> 00:05:04,240
It's the Hawaii of Asia.

146
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:07,273
It has one of the top three sunsets in the world.

147
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:10,240
We went to Kota Kinabalu in Malaysia.

148
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,207
(Kota Kinabalu, Malaysia)

149
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:14,973
That's where a lot of newlyweds go to.

150
00:05:14,973 --> 00:05:16,373
That's right.

151
00:05:16,373 --> 00:05:17,973
- We always feel like one. / - There are newlyweds.

152
00:05:17,973 --> 00:05:19,340
It's a perfect place

153
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:21,807
for newlyweds to enjoy the romantic mood.

154
00:05:21,807 --> 00:05:22,907
It has beautiful views.

155
00:05:22,907 --> 00:05:24,473
- That's right. / - Have you been there, Hyejung?

156
00:05:24,473 --> 00:05:26,473
- No, I have never been. / - You just heard about it.

157
00:05:26,473 --> 00:05:28,540
- So I'm very excited now. / - I see.

158
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:32,207
After we went to Jeju-do for our honeymoon,

159
00:05:32,207 --> 00:05:34,207
we didn't travel for 20 years.

160
00:05:34,207 --> 00:05:36,373
We went to Vietnam for our 20th wedding anniversary.

161
00:05:36,373 --> 00:05:38,173
Then we went to Kota Kinabalu

162
00:05:38,173 --> 00:05:40,140
on our 30th wedding anniversary.

163
00:05:40,773 --> 00:05:42,307
And it doesn't mean

164
00:05:42,307 --> 00:05:44,540
you have to go there.

165
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:47,040
You can have your parents go on a trip there

166
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:49,407
for their birthday or wedding anniversary

167
00:05:49,407 --> 00:05:50,240
since it's very cheap.

168
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,007
You should send them on a trip. They'd be so happy.

169
00:05:52,007 --> 00:05:54,307
The name of your team is Balu Tour.

170
00:05:54,307 --> 00:05:56,673
- Yangrak came up with that name. / - Why Balu?

171
00:05:56,673 --> 00:05:58,607
I kept asking him, "Kota Kina what?"

172
00:05:58,607 --> 00:06:00,540
I couldn't memorize our destination.

173
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:02,073
So we named it Balu Tour, which sounds like...

174
00:06:02,073 --> 00:06:03,673
- "Traveling on foot." / - Balu Tour?

175
00:06:03,673 --> 00:06:05,440
- It doesn't mean anything special. / - He taught me.

176
00:06:06,107 --> 00:06:07,107
Alright.

177
00:06:07,107 --> 00:06:09,007
Yuna and Hyungkyu, where did you go

178
00:06:09,007 --> 00:06:10,307
for your romantic getaway?

179
00:06:10,307 --> 00:06:11,373
We went to

180
00:06:11,373 --> 00:06:13,907
the city of festivals and delicious food.

181
00:06:13,907 --> 00:06:16,773
It's the best vacation spot

182
00:06:16,773 --> 00:06:19,340
in Japan for summer.

183
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:20,973
We went to Hokkaido.

184
00:06:20,973 --> 00:06:22,773
(Hokkaido, Japan)

185
00:06:22,773 --> 00:06:24,373
That sounds amazing.

186
00:06:24,373 --> 00:06:27,107
We've been to Hokkaido a few times on our show.

187
00:06:27,107 --> 00:06:28,973
Many trip planners went to Hokkaido on Battle Trip.

188
00:06:28,973 --> 00:06:30,107
I've seen those episodes.

189
00:06:30,107 --> 00:06:32,107
I don't think you just went to Hokkaido.

190
00:06:32,107 --> 00:06:34,207
There must be some twist in their trip.

191
00:06:34,207 --> 00:06:35,607
- That's true. / - That's why they went there again.

192
00:06:35,607 --> 00:06:37,773
We didn't go to the places you've been to.

193
00:06:37,773 --> 00:06:41,173
The places with beautiful nature

194
00:06:41,173 --> 00:06:43,507
have a lot of interesting things to see every month.

195
00:06:43,507 --> 00:06:44,973
And there are different foods.

196
00:06:44,973 --> 00:06:48,940
So we found a lot of new things there.

197
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:50,940
I know the place matters,

198
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:53,540
but it's also important who you travel with.

199
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:55,840
That's right, it varies depending on who you go with.

200
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,773
It's good to go on a trip with your friend

201
00:06:57,773 --> 00:07:00,207
but it is also amazing to go with your spouse.

202
00:07:00,207 --> 00:07:01,140
That's right.

203
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:03,507
When you go on a trip with your spouse...

204
00:07:03,507 --> 00:07:05,507
- It's very important to suit... / - Right.

205
00:07:05,507 --> 00:07:07,340
- The wife's taste. / - That's right.

206
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:08,473
Don't you agree?

207
00:07:08,473 --> 00:07:10,540
- Right, it must've been hard. / - Thank you.

208
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:11,973
(Feeling sympathy)

209
00:07:12,507 --> 00:07:14,740
It sounds like a trip of suffering for the husbands.

210
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:16,173
No, that's not true.

211
00:07:16,173 --> 00:07:17,807
- I had a great time. / - So...

212
00:07:17,807 --> 00:07:19,907
Hyungkyu, when you are in Japan,

213
00:07:19,907 --> 00:07:22,740
I bet a lot of people would think you're Japanese.

214
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:25,507
If I go to Japan, people talk to me in Japanese.

215
00:07:25,507 --> 00:07:27,807
When I'm in Thailand, people talk to me in Thai.

216
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,107
- That's true. / - It's the same in Singapore.

217
00:07:30,107 --> 00:07:31,707
It happens to some people.

218
00:07:31,707 --> 00:07:33,440
I see.

219
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:36,107
So, they went to romantic getaways

220
00:07:36,107 --> 00:07:38,573
to Kota Kinabalu and Hokkaido.

221
00:07:38,573 --> 00:07:40,273
But we're not the only ones going on these trips, right?

222
00:07:40,273 --> 00:07:41,807
We have our 100 impartial judges...

223
00:07:41,807 --> 00:07:44,007
- Who will vote on today's trips. / - Welcome.

224
00:07:44,007 --> 00:07:45,307
- Welcome. / - Welcome.

225
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,507
I'm so excited.

226
00:07:48,473 --> 00:07:49,707
I'm so excited.

227
00:07:49,973 --> 00:07:51,540
(Please enjoy our trip)

228
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:53,940
That's so sudden.

229
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:56,073
- Gosh. / - I just did it because she started it.

230
00:07:56,073 --> 00:07:57,373
It's too late.

231
00:07:57,373 --> 00:07:59,007
- Where should we go first? / - Elders first.

232
00:07:59,007 --> 00:08:00,940
Let's watch their trip first.

233
00:08:01,173 --> 00:08:02,773
Balu Tour to celebrate

234
00:08:02,773 --> 00:08:03,640
their 30th wedding anniversary.

235
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:04,640
Let's watch it together.

236
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:06,307
(Balu Tour to Kota Kinabalu starts now)

237
00:08:07,407 --> 00:08:09,440
(Please clap once)

238
00:08:10,273 --> 00:08:13,207
1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

239
00:08:13,207 --> 00:08:14,840
He always does that.

240
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:16,273
Do you think it's funny?

241
00:08:16,273 --> 00:08:18,107
She's always nagging me...

242
00:08:18,507 --> 00:08:20,973
- What do I have to lose? / - He tries to be funny.

243
00:08:20,973 --> 00:08:23,140
But it doesn't work because I'm getting old.

244
00:08:23,673 --> 00:08:26,240
- Are you shooting a show? / - Yes, we are.

245
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,340
- Make sure to be funny. / - Okay.

246
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:29,540
Don't put pressure on us.

247
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:31,607
We can't always be funny.

248
00:08:32,807 --> 00:08:36,240
Dad, you're not so funny these days. Mom is funnier.

249
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,707
You should try harder.

250
00:08:38,207 --> 00:08:40,840
I was very funny before you were born.

251
00:08:42,807 --> 00:08:45,407
Seriously, he was the best.

252
00:08:45,407 --> 00:08:48,240
- He was so funny. / - That's "Nero 25 Hours."

253
00:08:48,873 --> 00:08:51,873
(Screaming)

254
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:58,107
I hear I'm the funniest person in the nation.

255
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,640
(Laughing)

256
00:09:00,273 --> 00:09:02,207
(Whatever he did, people burst into laughter)

257
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:06,540
(He enjoyed a second heyday with "Alkkagi")

258
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:08,240
Look at his hairstyle.

259
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:10,440
I did his hair every day.

260
00:09:11,007 --> 00:09:12,207
I blow-dried his hair.

261
00:09:12,207 --> 00:09:14,107
(The bobbed hair was his trademark)

262
00:09:15,773 --> 00:09:17,540
Yangrak doesn't have anything left now.

263
00:09:18,407 --> 00:09:20,640
I should probably run a factory or something.

264
00:09:21,207 --> 00:09:23,607
I'll support the family. Don't worry.

265
00:09:24,207 --> 00:09:26,107
(Since 30 years ago)

266
00:09:26,107 --> 00:09:28,273
(She was famous as a pretty comedienne)

267
00:09:29,607 --> 00:09:32,640
- She's really... / - She's so beautiful.

268
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,473
Gosh, that's me.

269
00:09:34,873 --> 00:09:36,707
- She's so pretty. / - Back then...

270
00:09:36,707 --> 00:09:39,407
There weren't many Western-style beauties.

271
00:09:39,407 --> 00:09:40,407
(Model-turned comedienne, Paeng Hyeonsuk)

272
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,973
(After she met Yangrak)

273
00:09:43,573 --> 00:09:46,173
(She married him)

274
00:09:47,207 --> 00:09:49,407
(They've lived together for 30 years)

275
00:09:49,407 --> 00:09:52,240
(Depending on each other)

276
00:09:54,073 --> 00:09:56,007
Our 30th wedding anniversary is coming up.

277
00:09:56,007 --> 00:09:57,840
- I'm so excited about this trip. / - For me...

278
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:58,707
I don't want to be Hana's mom

279
00:09:58,707 --> 00:10:00,140
on our 30th anniversary.

280
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:01,840
I just want to be Paeng Hyeonsuk.

281
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,673
It's Paeng Suhui. You changed your name.

282
00:10:03,673 --> 00:10:05,473
I want to go as a woman named Paeng Suhui.

283
00:10:05,473 --> 00:10:06,840
Okay.

284
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:09,273
Where do you want to go?

285
00:10:09,273 --> 00:10:11,240
Hana told me to go to somewhere called

286
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:12,340
Kota something.

287
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:15,373
- There's no country called that. / - There is.

288
00:10:15,373 --> 00:10:16,973
- Kota? / - Hello?

289
00:10:16,973 --> 00:10:19,373
Hana, you recommended a country

290
00:10:19,373 --> 00:10:21,307
for our trip the other day.

291
00:10:21,307 --> 00:10:22,240
It was Kota or something.

292
00:10:23,507 --> 00:10:26,040
- Where is it? / - It's Kota Kinabalu in Malaysia.

293
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:28,573
It's Kota Kinabalu in Malaysia.

294
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:31,007
(Malaysia)

295
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,707
(Wonderful natural environment and various cultures)

296
00:10:34,407 --> 00:10:36,840
A lot of Korean tourists go there.

297
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:38,640
It has one of the top three sunsets in the world.

298
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,773
It's so nice there.

299
00:10:43,273 --> 00:10:44,740
My goodness.

300
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:47,940
Was that Yangrak?

301
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:50,340
- Yes. / - It was Yangrak?

302
00:10:50,673 --> 00:10:52,373
That's amazing.

303
00:10:53,973 --> 00:10:55,373
(The sky turns to beautiful red during sunset)

304
00:10:55,373 --> 00:10:57,240
The ocean is very beautiful.

305
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:59,240
It's a good vacation spot.

306
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:01,107
- It was beautiful. / - I know you as Alex Choi.

307
00:11:01,107 --> 00:11:03,473
- I didn't know you could surf. / - It was amazing.

308
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:06,873
- There's Yangrak. / - The water is so clear.

309
00:11:06,873 --> 00:11:09,373
I think it will be good

310
00:11:09,373 --> 00:11:11,340
for your romantic getaway.

311
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:12,907
- It sounds nice. / - Really?

312
00:11:13,507 --> 00:11:15,840
We should sleep in separate rooms though.

313
00:11:16,073 --> 00:11:17,107
(He bursts into laughter)

314
00:11:17,107 --> 00:11:18,240
- I shouldn't laugh. / - Really?

315
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,207
What's so funny?

316
00:11:20,207 --> 00:11:23,207
- He snores a lot. / - We sleep in separate bedrooms.

317
00:11:23,207 --> 00:11:26,207
The last time we slept on the same bed was...

318
00:11:26,207 --> 00:11:27,307
We've never done that.

319
00:11:27,307 --> 00:11:29,240
We did, twice. That's why we have Hyeok and Hana.

320
00:11:30,007 --> 00:11:31,573
She's shy.

321
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:34,673
Do you have the same tastes

322
00:11:34,673 --> 00:11:36,007
when it comes to traveling?

323
00:11:36,007 --> 00:11:37,373
Not really.

324
00:11:37,373 --> 00:11:39,473
- We don't. / - We don't have the same taste.

325
00:11:39,473 --> 00:11:41,840
But I try to cater to him...

326
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,440
- Since he's my husband. / - She always says that.

327
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:46,240
But she brings her blanket and pillow.

328
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,040
Oh, I heard about that.

329
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:50,340
I can't sleep well when it's not my bed.

330
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:51,573
So...

331
00:11:52,107 --> 00:11:53,540
She's out of her mind.

332
00:11:54,107 --> 00:11:55,840
She says she can't sleep well in a different bed.

333
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:58,540
- She shouldn't travel. / - Yangrak, this show is...

334
00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:00,073
I'm so upset.

335
00:12:00,073 --> 00:12:02,107
- It's totally... / - This will all get edited out.

336
00:12:02,107 --> 00:12:03,340
She takes a lot of luggage.

337
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:05,973
You should say it with a smile.

338
00:12:06,173 --> 00:12:07,407
That's funny.

339
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:09,673
She's very funny.

340
00:12:10,607 --> 00:12:12,740
- Go, Balu Tour! / - Go, Balu Tour!

341
00:12:14,073 --> 00:12:16,240
We're leaving tomorrow.

342
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:18,673
I don't have a lot to pack.

343
00:12:18,673 --> 00:12:20,807
I take briefs in every color.

344
00:12:20,807 --> 00:12:22,407
He doesn't have to show us...

345
00:12:22,407 --> 00:12:23,673
(It's too much information)

346
00:12:24,307 --> 00:12:26,340
I have too many briefs.

347
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:29,740
His suitcase is full of briefs.

348
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:31,773
- Hello, Hyeon. / - Hello.

349
00:12:31,773 --> 00:12:34,373
What was that? It's about Malaysia.

350
00:12:34,373 --> 00:12:37,173
- Kota Kinabalu? / - How did you know that?

351
00:12:37,173 --> 00:12:39,173
- He knew it. / - He's good.

352
00:12:39,173 --> 00:12:41,473
(He gets good tips for Kota Kinabalu)

353
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:46,273
I don't pack much when I travel. I keep it simple.

354
00:12:46,273 --> 00:12:49,640
This medicine is for menopause. I need this.

355
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:51,373
- Medicines. / - And this is...

356
00:12:51,373 --> 00:12:53,607

Adlay, walnuts, almond.

363
00:13:07,273 --> 00:13:09,540
I take this when I feel very tired.

366
00:13:14,307 --> 00:13:15,407
You shouldn't go.

She's gained a lot of weight. She's heavy.

374
00:13:34,573 --> 00:13:36,040
You're eating too much.

375

How will we go? You told me not to worry about it.

387
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:10,240
I took care of it. Hana installed an app on my phone.

388
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:13,373
We can take a taxi. It's very cheap.

389
00:14:13,373 --> 00:14:16,273

I'm glad that we have twin beds.

- I think so. / - It's nice.

409
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:03,607
You should change before going to sleep.

410

Gosh, I can't take this off now.

411

It had the microphone on it.

413

- Yes. / - Even when he showered?

415

- We should call them. / - Where are they?

422
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:33,873
We can't sleep with the cameras on.

(What is going on here?)

532
00:20:26,173 --> 00:20:27,840
Sorry? Pardon?

533
00:20:28,873 --> 00:20:29,873
- What did he say? / - Delivery?

534
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:32,507
(He seems serious)

535
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:38,207
He wants us to relax here without turning back.

536
00:20:38,307 --> 00:20:39,307
So...

537
00:20:39,473 --> 00:20:40,707
Thank you.

538
00:20:41,373 --> 00:20:42,707
- Thank you. / - Out.

539
00:20:42,707 --> 00:20:44,307
- Out? / - He wants us to leave.

540
00:20:44,307 --> 00:20:45,707
The chairs are already reserved.

541
00:20:45,707 --> 00:20:47,073
Those were for guests at the resort only.

542
00:20:47,473 --> 00:20:49,107
That part of the beach is privately owned.

543
00:20:49,507 --> 00:20:50,707
- Sorry. / - We have to move?

544
00:20:50,873 --> 00:20:52,240
Healing my butt.

545
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:54,173
It was so empty there.

546
00:20:54,173 --> 00:20:55,907
- I didn't know. / - The sign was hidden.

547
00:20:55,907 --> 00:20:57,640
- It was empty for a reason. / - Right.

548
00:20:57,707 --> 00:20:59,140
He didn't make any reservations.

549
00:21:01,373 --> 00:21:03,007
(They're taking a stroll along the other beach)

550
00:21:03,007 --> 00:21:04,440
Actually, I surprisingly...

551
00:21:05,273 --> 00:21:06,673
Didn't like that side of the beach.

552
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:08,240
It was too empty.

553
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:10,107
- Right, this part is crowded. / - Exactly.

554
00:21:10,107 --> 00:21:12,773
- But it's nice. / - We ought to be with people.

555
00:21:12,773 --> 00:21:14,173
- It has a nice vibe. / - Yes.

556
00:21:14,373 --> 00:21:16,573
- This feels very exotic and nice. / - Right.

557
00:21:16,907 --> 00:21:18,907
It ought to feel exotic. We're in another country.

558
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:20,173
"It ought to feel exotic."

559
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:22,773
- It felt especially more exotic. / - She's right.

560
00:21:22,773 --> 00:21:25,273
- "It ought to feel exotic." / - A slow walk is nice too.

561
00:21:25,273 --> 00:21:26,273
Right, a slow walk.

562
00:21:26,273 --> 00:21:28,540
- We've been so busy. / - It's cool here too.

563
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:29,640
Yes, this is cool here.

564
00:21:30,207 --> 00:21:31,507
How nice.

565
00:21:32,507 --> 00:21:33,773
Look at the color of the water.

566
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:36,607
It's cool here.

567
00:21:36,607 --> 00:21:38,207
(The very sight makes them feel cool)

568
00:21:38,207 --> 00:21:41,307
The color of the water is amazing.

569
00:21:42,073 --> 00:21:43,307
- This is nice. / - Seriously.

570
00:21:43,307 --> 00:21:45,040
It was so nice over there.

571
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:45,940
Isn't this nice?

572
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:47,407
- Aren't you happy you came? / - It's nice.

573
00:21:47,407 --> 00:21:50,040
- It was worth the boat ride, right? / - Yes, it's nice.

574
00:21:51,873 --> 00:21:54,073
- Hello. / - Hello.

575
00:21:55,307 --> 00:21:57,607
Why did you come here with another guy?

576
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:00,840
- You're college students? / - Yes.

577
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:03,140
- Are you having fun? / - Yes.

578
00:22:03,673 --> 00:22:06,573
We're quite old. We came here on a trip to celebrate

579
00:22:06,573 --> 00:22:07,940
our 30th wedding anniversary.

580
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:09,473
- Will we be on TV? / - In September.

581
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:12,240
- Show us a special talent. / - That was sudden.

582
00:22:12,373 --> 00:22:13,673
- A special talent? / - That was sudden.

583
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:17,940
- Show us a special talent. / - I see.

584
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:19,473
If it's good, it'll be on TV.

585
00:22:19,473 --> 00:22:20,773
If it's not good...

586
00:22:20,773 --> 00:22:22,740
That was random.

587
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:24,807
- Slapstick comedy. / - Slapstick comedy is nice.

588
00:22:25,273 --> 00:22:28,340
For the viewers of Battle Trip,

589
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:30,607
they will each show us their special talent.

590
00:22:30,607 --> 00:22:32,073
I'll impersonate Lee Jungjae.

591
00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:33,540
So random.

592
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:34,207
Youngsters these days...

593
00:22:34,207 --> 00:22:35,473
- Are great. / - He's actually doing it.

594
00:22:35,473 --> 00:22:36,507
Action.

595
00:22:38,273 --> 00:22:40,273
"Look here, face reader."

596
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:41,440
(He spoils the mood)

597
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:43,873
- All of a sudden... / - You did well.

598
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:48,240
(He secures his airtime by going into the water)

599
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:51,140
- He's really cute. / - So, is this all you prepared?

600
00:22:51,473 --> 00:22:53,507
Gosh, you're insulting me.

601
00:22:53,507 --> 00:22:54,707
If it is, it'd be disappointing.

602
00:22:54,707 --> 00:22:56,707
I prepared something exciting,

603
00:22:56,707 --> 00:22:59,007
thrilling, suspenseful and fantastic.

604
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:01,773
- It'll be thrilling. Let's go. / - Where is that?

605
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:04,107
- I can't wait to see what it is. / - I'm not lying.

606
00:23:04,107 --> 00:23:05,473
He's all talk.

607
00:23:07,473 --> 00:23:08,740
Parasailing.

608
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:10,973
- Parasailing... / - That activity can be scary.

609
00:23:10,973 --> 00:23:13,640
It costs about $27 per person.

610
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:14,873
90 ringgit.

611
00:23:18,573 --> 00:23:21,373
(Yangrak puts on the safety gear)

612
00:23:23,273 --> 00:23:25,607
(What is Hyeonsuk doing?)

613
00:23:27,607 --> 00:23:29,973
- Stay still. / - I'm fine. That's enough.

614
00:23:30,573 --> 00:23:32,107
(All over his face)

615
00:23:32,473 --> 00:23:34,973
You need it. Your face will get burnt.

616
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:36,507
Ma'am, sit down.

617
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:38,707
- Ma'am, sit down. / - He told you to sit down.

618
00:23:39,707 --> 00:23:40,973
"Ma'am, sit down."

619
00:23:42,073 --> 00:23:45,240
Here, here. Grab this part. Grab this part here.

620
00:23:45,373 --> 00:23:47,607
- Grab the part right here. / - It's the one below.

621
00:23:47,607 --> 00:23:48,807
(Looking clumsy)

622
00:23:50,007 --> 00:23:51,473
Actually, I get scared easily.

623
00:23:51,473 --> 00:23:54,340
My life tends to stay in the safe area.

624
00:23:54,507 --> 00:23:57,140
My wife and I aren't thrill-seekers,

625
00:23:57,140 --> 00:23:58,440
we don't enjoy going on adventures.

626
00:24:00,373 --> 00:24:03,373
- It's scary in the beginning. / - Right.

627
00:24:03,807 --> 00:24:05,907
- That nervousness. / - Once you're in the air, it's fine.

628
00:24:05,907 --> 00:24:08,273
(Screaming)

629
00:24:09,307 --> 00:24:10,340
(They're only 1m above the water)

630
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:11,807
Oh, no.

631
00:24:12,173 --> 00:24:13,807
When we go up into the air, it's scary.

632
00:24:13,807 --> 00:24:14,707
How's it?

633
00:24:14,707 --> 00:24:16,107
Great. This is great.

634
00:24:16,673 --> 00:24:18,007
We're going higher.

635
00:24:18,007 --> 00:24:21,240
We're at about the 6th or 7th floor of a building.

636
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:24,740
- We're at about the 10th floor. / - It's going up higher.

637
00:24:24,773 --> 00:24:25,840
(They're only 5m above the water)

638
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:27,740
We're at the 20th floor.

639
00:24:28,540 --> 00:24:30,073
(Parasailing brings thrills to this middle-aged couple)

640
00:24:30,073 --> 00:24:32,307
- It feels like we're flying. / - Right?

641
00:24:32,973 --> 00:24:36,640
You look like the fairy

642
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:37,573
who lives in the sky.

643
00:24:37,573 --> 00:24:38,740
Thank you.

644
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:39,740
(They spent 30 years together)

645
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:42,173
You look like the woodcutter.

646
00:24:42,173 --> 00:24:43,873
(Yangrak and Hyeonsuk are a woodcutter and a fairy)

647
00:24:43,873 --> 00:24:45,540
- He was scared. / - It was scary in the beginning.

648
00:24:45,540 --> 00:24:47,673
- Right. / - But it was really scary for me as well.

649
00:24:47,673 --> 00:24:49,773
But it was fun. It was cool.

650
00:24:51,107 --> 00:24:52,840
- This is nice. / - Yes.

651
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:54,640
This comes with the right amount of thrill.

652
00:24:55,473 --> 00:24:58,140
It's fun too. We're going down.

653
00:24:58,140 --> 00:24:59,373
We're going down.

654
00:24:59,373 --> 00:25:00,840
Are we going down now?

655
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:02,873
We're going into the water? This is scary.

656
00:25:03,707 --> 00:25:05,573
No, this is scary.

657
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:08,273
No, no.

658
00:25:08,973 --> 00:25:10,707
They dunk you in the water.

659
00:25:10,807 --> 00:25:12,440
They dunk you in the water.

660
00:25:13,207 --> 00:25:13,973
That was special treatment.

661
00:25:13,973 --> 00:25:16,107
They put you in the water.

662
00:25:20,173 --> 00:25:22,173
(Struggling)

663
00:25:22,173 --> 00:25:23,207
No.

664
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:25,240
My goodness.

665
00:25:27,473 --> 00:25:29,873
- They ought to do that once. / - Exactly.

666
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:33,840
- Stop it. Stop! / - Stop it.

667
00:25:33,873 --> 00:25:35,307
When we were going down,

668
00:25:35,307 --> 00:25:38,573
the blue water splashed right at me.

669
00:25:38,573 --> 00:25:40,107
It was really scary.

670
00:25:40,607 --> 00:25:42,307
My wife said that it was scary.

671
00:25:42,307 --> 00:25:43,873
I thought she was cute then.

672
00:25:43,873 --> 00:25:45,273
(He's undeniably a romanticist)

673
00:25:45,473 --> 00:25:47,440
- That's true. / - This is fun.

674
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:48,507
(They dry their bodies with the cool ocean breeze)

675
00:25:48,507 --> 00:25:49,807
Isn't this fun?

676
00:25:50,507 --> 00:25:51,973
I hope we don't crash into that.

677
00:25:52,473 --> 00:25:54,140
Let's wave at them.

678
00:25:54,940 --> 00:25:56,140
Hello.

679
00:25:56,973 --> 00:25:58,773
He waved at me.

680
00:25:58,773 --> 00:26:00,307
(They share greetings like friends)

681
00:26:00,307 --> 00:26:01,773
We're flying in the sky.

682
00:26:01,773 --> 00:26:03,540
We're flying like the eagles.

683
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:04,773
I won't ever forget this experience.

684
00:26:04,773 --> 00:26:06,740
Exactly, when would we have the chance to do this?

685
00:26:08,407 --> 00:26:12,473
??As I watch the flying birds ??

686
00:26:12,473 --> 00:26:14,007
Why do you sound so sad when you sing?

687
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:21,073
??As I watch the flying birds ??

688
00:26:23,373 --> 00:26:24,507
Whenever I listened to that song,

689
00:26:24,507 --> 00:26:28,173
I wanted to fly like a bird.

690
00:26:28,173 --> 00:26:30,473
And my wish came true today.

691
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:32,673
I flew just like this.

692
00:26:32,673 --> 00:26:34,340
Right, she must've felt like a bird.

693
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:37,373
(Balu Tour, Yangrak's Day)

694
00:26:37,373 --> 00:26:38,740
"Manukan Island."

695
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:40,440
Yes, let's eat something.

696
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:42,173
- Exactly. / - Southeast Asian noodles are great.

697
00:26:42,173 --> 00:26:44,307
She likes noodles.

698
00:26:44,707 --> 00:26:47,507
I saw her eat noodles for 3 meals a day.

699
00:26:47,507 --> 00:26:48,207
I was shocked.

700
00:26:48,507 --> 00:26:51,007
I want her to eat all the noodles she wants.

701
00:26:51,007 --> 00:26:54,207
We can have 5 meals there. I'll let her eat a lot.

702
00:26:54,573 --> 00:26:57,040
(10 minutes from Jesselton Point to the restaurant)

703
00:26:57,040 --> 00:27:00,607
(Using a transportation app is cheaper than taxis)

704
00:27:00,907 --> 00:27:02,040
Ta-da.

705
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:04,040
I already know it's good.

706
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:05,140
This restaurant has to be good.

707
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:06,307
Go inside.

708
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:09,907
(A restaurant popular amongst the locals)

709
00:27:09,907 --> 00:27:11,907
One of the merits of Kota Kinabalu is that

710
00:27:11,907 --> 00:27:13,340
people don't cook breakfast.

711
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:14,507
They all eat out.

712
00:27:14,507 --> 00:27:16,307
- Like that... / - It's too hot in the morning.

713
00:27:16,307 --> 00:27:17,907
So a lot of locals were at the restaurant.

714
00:27:17,907 --> 00:27:20,640
Restaurants that locals eat at are really cheap.

715
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:22,640
(Open from 6:30 a.m. till 6 p.m. on weekdays)

716
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:23,807
(Till 4 p.m. on weekends)

717
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:27,107
Yangrak, when did you find this place?

718
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:28,573
Remember Hyeon?

719
00:27:28,573 --> 00:27:31,107
Jeong Hyeon runs a travel agency.

720
00:27:31,773 --> 00:27:33,207
When I said that you like noodles,

721
00:27:33,207 --> 00:27:34,440
he said to come here.

722
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:36,273
- That's why we came here. / - Thank you.

723
00:27:36,373 --> 00:27:37,607
Excuse me.

724
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:39,807
- Selamat pagi. / - Selamat pagi.

725
00:27:39,807 --> 00:27:41,373
- Selamat pagi. / - Selamat pagi.

726
00:27:41,373 --> 00:27:45,273
- It means good morning. / - This restaurant is very...

727
00:27:45,273 --> 00:27:46,340
Food.

728
00:27:48,207 --> 00:27:50,140
Very... Favorite...

729
00:27:50,473 --> 00:27:53,040
I like very delicious... I want.

730
00:27:53,740 --> 00:27:54,807
(Laughing)

731
00:27:54,807 --> 00:27:56,440
- You said all the important words. / - Exactly.

732
00:27:58,107 --> 00:27:59,440
(The waitress recommends these two)

733
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:01,707
You can have A1 and A2.

734
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:04,473
This is how you say, "Thank you." Tell her that now.

735
00:28:04,473 --> 00:28:08,073
- Terima kashi. / - Terima kashi.

736
00:28:08,073 --> 00:28:10,473
- She's nice. / - Terima kashi.

737
00:28:10,473 --> 00:28:12,173
(How will the first meal of the Balu Tour taste?)

738
00:28:12,773 --> 00:28:13,673
(Here are the most popular dishes)

739
00:28:13,673 --> 00:28:15,773
- That looks good. / - It looks delicious.

740
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:18,873
The broth is rich but it's clean.

741
00:28:18,873 --> 00:28:20,673
- It's clean. / - It's really good.

742
00:28:20,673 --> 00:28:22,140
- It comes with meat. / - Ngau chap.

743
00:28:22,373 --> 00:28:24,440
- That must be good. / - My mouth is watering now.

744
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:28,073
It tastes like the soup has lamb in it.

745
00:28:28,073 --> 00:28:29,507
- I bet that one is tasty. / - Lamb.

746
00:28:31,373 --> 00:28:33,240
- That's laksa. / - Laksa.

747
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:34,373
Laksa is famous.

748
00:28:34,373 --> 00:28:36,207
- With cilantro... / - This is...

749
00:28:36,707 --> 00:28:38,073
- And lemon. / - It looks good.

750
00:28:38,407 --> 00:28:39,307
(The irresistible laksa with rice noodles)

751
00:28:39,307 --> 00:28:39,973
It looks good.

752
00:28:39,973 --> 00:28:42,273
People who don't like food with strong smells

753
00:28:42,273 --> 00:28:44,873
won't like it, but you should still try it.

754
00:28:44,873 --> 00:28:47,207
Once you get hooked on it, you'll keep eating this.

755
00:28:47,207 --> 00:28:48,807
(Which noodle dish will Hyeonsuk like more?)

756
00:28:49,107 --> 00:28:50,340
Gosh, it's here.

757
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:52,273
My goodness, that looks delicious.

758
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:55,473
Thank you.

759
00:28:55,473 --> 00:28:56,807
(Mixed noodles and fish ball soup, $2.60)

760
00:28:56,807 --> 00:28:57,773
(Stir-fried cabbage in oyster sauce, $1.80)

761
00:28:57,773 --> 00:29:00,407
You should try these first.

762
00:29:00,873 --> 00:29:02,107
Eat whatever you like the best.

763
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:04,473
Let me taste the broth first.

764
00:29:04,473 --> 00:29:05,873
- Go ahead. / - Okay.

765
00:29:11,273 --> 00:29:12,407
This is refreshing.

766
00:29:12,540 --> 00:29:14,707
- Is it good? / - It's very refreshing.

767
00:29:14,707 --> 00:29:16,473
It warms my stomach right away.

768
00:29:16,773 --> 00:29:19,373
You can taste the spices in the aftertaste.

769
00:29:19,373 --> 00:29:20,973
But I like the scent of spices.

770
00:29:22,107 --> 00:29:24,040
This is the tripe. It's the beef tripe.

771
00:29:24,407 --> 00:29:26,607
And this looks like the ox foot.

772
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:28,840
These are beef innards.

773
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:30,707
This is an invigorating dish.

774
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:33,573
It's like having soup with omasum.

775
00:29:33,573 --> 00:29:34,807
They gave you a lot of meat.

776
00:29:34,807 --> 00:29:36,440
- Yes. That one is... / - The portion was big.

777
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:37,573
- Knee cartilage. / - That's amazing.

778
00:29:37,573 --> 00:29:39,240
To eat the knee cartilage in Korea,

779
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:41,540
it costs about $12 to $13.

780
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:44,173
But you can eat plenty there for $2.

781
00:29:45,707 --> 00:29:48,073
I think this is spicy sauce.

782
00:29:48,573 --> 00:29:49,607
It's spicy.

783
00:29:49,607 --> 00:29:51,773
- You like spicy food. / - Okay.

784
00:29:51,773 --> 00:29:53,140
Try it with the sauce.

785
00:29:53,907 --> 00:29:55,640
How's the tripe? Isn't it good?

786
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:57,340
It's good.

787
00:29:57,340 --> 00:29:58,373
Is it good?

788
00:29:58,373 --> 00:29:59,407
Let me try the noodles.

789
00:29:59,407 --> 00:30:02,107
(She has a big bite of the noodles)

790
00:30:02,107 --> 00:30:04,473
This is like omasum in Korea, right?

791
00:30:06,773 --> 00:30:07,373
What is this one?

792
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:08,640
It's firm.

793
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:12,373
It's tender too. It's not too chewy.

794
00:30:13,373 --> 00:30:14,673
It's aromatic too.

795
00:30:15,073 --> 00:30:17,940
This flavor is really unique.

796
00:30:18,173 --> 00:30:20,540
It doesn't taste like soy sauce but it has that color.

797
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:22,640
(He's not listening to her)

798
00:30:22,873 --> 00:30:25,207
- I can taste beef... / - To be honest, we went to...

799
00:30:25,207 --> 00:30:27,707
That restaurant because she likes noodles.

800
00:30:27,707 --> 00:30:29,740
- He was being considerate. / - I ate more than her.

801
00:30:29,740 --> 00:30:32,107
- You're just eating without a word. / - Exactly.

802
00:30:32,307 --> 00:30:34,173
Stop eating and tell me what you think.

803
00:30:34,907 --> 00:30:36,007
It's good.

804
00:30:36,007 --> 00:30:37,473
(It's just good)

805
00:30:37,473 --> 00:30:38,507
I keep craving this.

806
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:42,107
(It's good, what more must I say?)

807
00:30:42,107 --> 00:30:43,407
- See? / - My goodness.

808
00:30:45,007 --> 00:30:46,507
- This restaurant is good. / - The texture is interesting.

809
00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:49,640
Now, onto this one. Let's try this, Yangrak.

810
00:30:51,007 --> 00:30:52,340
(A generous amount of chicken and shrimp)

811
00:30:52,340 --> 00:30:54,307
- Gosh, that looks good. / - That must be delicious.

812
00:30:54,307 --> 00:30:55,773
It's the best when you don't have an appetite.

813
00:30:56,507 --> 00:30:57,773
Cheers.

814
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:00,807
- That's laksa, right? / - Yes, laksa.

815
00:31:02,607 --> 00:31:05,407
This tastes like tom yum goong.

816
00:31:05,407 --> 00:31:06,707
You know the Thai dish?

817
00:31:06,707 --> 00:31:08,473
It tastes like that.

818
00:31:08,573 --> 00:31:09,940
People who love that will like this.

819
00:31:10,507 --> 00:31:12,540
- But some might not like it. / - No, no.

820
00:31:12,540 --> 00:31:14,207
The smell isn't overpowering.

821
00:31:14,207 --> 00:31:16,707
And the aftertaste is slightly sweet.

822
00:31:16,707 --> 00:31:18,707
- Gosh, it looks appetizing. / - It's rich and flavorful.

823
00:31:18,707 --> 00:31:20,440
- The broth... / - It has depth.

824
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:21,840
I love tom yum goong.

825
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:24,007
- My mouth is watering. / - Right, right.

826
00:31:24,007 --> 00:31:25,473
You must really want to eat that now.

827
00:31:26,073 --> 00:31:27,407
It was really good.

828
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:30,740
(Hyeonsuk keeps on eating)

829
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:32,973
I'm glad I didn't eat yesterday.

830
00:31:35,873 --> 00:31:39,207
(They fill up their stomachs with noodles)

831
00:31:40,707 --> 00:31:43,307
I think my mouth is at a crossroad.

832
00:31:43,307 --> 00:31:45,707
I'm torn if I should keep eating.

833
00:31:45,707 --> 00:31:48,440
- Don't be picky while traveling. / - You're right.

834
00:31:48,673 --> 00:31:51,007
Everything gets mixed in our stomachs anyway.

835
00:31:51,140 --> 00:31:52,673
- Smile. Smile now. / - Sure.

836
00:31:54,107 --> 00:31:55,973
- That looks nice. / - You listen to your wife well.

837
00:31:55,973 --> 00:31:57,373
- I like this more. / - Right?

838
00:31:57,773 --> 00:31:59,207
Hyeonsuk likes this dish more.

839
00:31:59,207 --> 00:32:00,707
- This is more to my taste. / - But I like this one more.

840
00:32:01,373 --> 00:32:03,340
- I really like laksa. / - The broth is rich.

841
00:32:03,807 --> 00:32:05,273
It feels like it recharges

842
00:32:05,273 --> 00:32:07,840
the energy I used up through sweating.

843
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:08,907
I like this one more.

844
00:32:09,473 --> 00:32:11,007
This would get rid of your hangover.

845
00:32:11,007 --> 00:32:13,673
It might be because I like to drink but I like this more.

846
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:16,673
Isn't this great?

847
00:32:17,707 --> 00:32:19,107
We came to a good restaurant.

848
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:22,173
How much is it?

849
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:24,073
Let me explain.

850
00:32:24,307 --> 00:32:26,973
1 ringgit is 30 cents.

851
00:32:26,973 --> 00:32:28,740
- Really? / - Yes.

852
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:31,107
- Then how much is it? / - The noodles we had...

853
00:32:31,107 --> 00:32:33,807
This one costs 8.5 ringgits.

854
00:32:34,207 --> 00:32:36,973
- If it's 8.5 ringgits... / - Let's say we round up.

855
00:32:36,973 --> 00:32:40,473
If it's 8.5 ringgits, it's about $2.60.

856
00:32:40,473 --> 00:32:42,373
- That's for 1 bowl? It's so cheap. / - It's $2.60.

857
00:32:42,473 --> 00:32:45,807
The bill came out to 39.5 ringgits in total.

858
00:32:45,807 --> 00:32:47,207
- Let's round up to 40. / - Make it 40.

859
00:32:47,207 --> 00:32:49,540
- 4 times 3 is 12. It's $12. / - 4 times 3 is 12.

860
00:32:49,540 --> 00:32:51,307
- But we ate a lot. / - That's for the whole meal.

861
00:32:51,773 --> 00:32:54,207
- Only $12? / - It's very cheap here.

862
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:55,540
We ate a lot.

863
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:57,673
I think two glasses of draft beer

864
00:32:57,673 --> 00:32:59,007
cost more than $12 in Sapporo.

865
00:32:59,007 --> 00:33:00,807
- $12 won't be enough there. / - Right, probably not.

866
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:02,840
Everything was delicious.

867
00:33:03,307 --> 00:33:04,407
Delicious.

868
00:33:06,340 --> 00:33:10,140
Traveling can be a bit tiring.

869
00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:11,307
That's why...

870
00:33:12,140 --> 00:33:14,173
We'll get a massage that will get rid of our fatigue.

871
00:33:14,173 --> 00:33:15,840
You should go to a spa after eating.

872
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:17,073
We ought to rest.

873
00:33:17,073 --> 00:33:19,073
That's right. We're here to relax.

874
00:33:19,073 --> 00:33:20,973
(Into the place where they can relax)

875
00:33:21,773 --> 00:33:25,873
(Yangrak and Hyeonsuk will become Emperor Nero?)

876
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:33,073
- Oh, with salt. / - Salt.

877
00:33:33,273 --> 00:33:34,307
Why are you filming this?

878
00:33:36,773 --> 00:33:39,940
(Step 2, the whole body massage)

879
00:33:39,940 --> 00:33:43,340
(Yangrak's gift is a chance for them to relax)

880
00:33:43,707 --> 00:33:45,573
(It takes 15 minutes to this luxurious spa shop)

881
00:33:45,573 --> 00:33:47,407
(It's located within a 5-star resort)

882
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:49,640
- The atmosphere is different. / - My gosh.

883
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:51,473
It looks very clean and nice here.

884
00:33:51,473 --> 00:33:53,773
- I thought you'd like it. / - Thank you.

885
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:55,940
I was glad I've lived with him for 30 years.

886
00:33:55,940 --> 00:33:57,973
I have a reservation under Choi.

887
00:33:57,973 --> 00:33:59,573
(He made a reservation in advance)

888
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:04,840
My husband is very handsome.

889
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:07,740
- Thank you. / - You speak good English too.

890
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:09,407
- No, this is nothing. / - My gosh.

891
00:34:09,407 --> 00:34:12,073
- Where did you learn English? / - How are you?

892
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:18,240
You went to a high-end shop.

893
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:19,873
- It was facing the beach. / - Right.

894
00:34:20,140 --> 00:34:21,273
The view is great too.

895
00:34:21,273 --> 00:34:23,207
- This shop was quite expensive. / - It's expensive.

896
00:34:23,207 --> 00:34:27,073
But to get a massage as luxurious as that in Korea...

897
00:34:27,073 --> 00:34:29,073
- It's expensive. / - It's 3 or 4 times more expensive.

898
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:31,840
- Honey, get rid of your fatigue. / - Thank you.

899
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:33,007
- Thank you. / - You're welcome.

900
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:35,573
This will relieve all the stress that's been piling up.

901
00:34:36,273 --> 00:34:38,540
- This is the foot massage. / - The foot massage.

902
00:34:39,207 --> 00:34:41,307
Our health starts from our feet.

903
00:34:41,307 --> 00:34:42,473
Gosh, this is nice.

904
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:45,373
This is my first foot massage ever.

905
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:47,840
Oh, my. I'm getting a special treatment.

906
00:34:48,407 --> 00:34:50,773
The important agenda is to celebrate our anniversary.

907
00:34:50,773 --> 00:34:51,907
I don't need to think about anything but...

908
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:55,173
Even if it's only for a few days,

909
00:34:55,173 --> 00:34:58,107
I want her to forget about her busy life here

910
00:34:58,107 --> 00:35:00,173
and spend a nice time there while we admire

911
00:35:00,173 --> 00:35:03,607
the beautiful scenery and eat delicious food.

912
00:35:03,607 --> 00:35:04,740
Away from work and all.

913
00:35:06,007 --> 00:35:07,440
- How is it? / - It's good.

914
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:09,173
This is a good trip.

915
00:35:11,573 --> 00:35:12,940
I really do feel like a king here.

916
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:15,407
- I played Emperor Nero long ago. / - Emperor Nero.

917
00:35:15,407 --> 00:35:17,707
- Oh, dear, Lord! / - His costume did look similar.

918
00:35:17,707 --> 00:35:20,140
Clean my feet, massage them,

919
00:35:20,140 --> 00:35:22,073
and get rid of the fatigue.

920
00:35:22,807 --> 00:35:24,540
(Hyeonsuk plays along right away)

921
00:35:24,540 --> 00:35:27,073
And get rid of the fatigue.

922
00:35:27,407 --> 00:35:29,340
(They are a perfect match)

923
00:35:29,340 --> 00:35:31,407
I knew it.

924
00:35:31,407 --> 00:35:32,873
Because I'm married to Emperor Nero,

925
00:35:32,873 --> 00:35:33,707
I'm living in luxury.

926
00:35:33,707 --> 00:35:35,207
- Thank you. / - You're welcome.

927
00:35:36,907 --> 00:35:38,507
(Time flies by for them)

928
00:35:38,507 --> 00:35:40,440
Time is flying by.

929
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:42,473
- It's going by so fast. / - Right.

930
00:35:42,473 --> 00:35:45,373
Let this last for a long time. I wish it'd last forever.

931
00:35:48,873 --> 00:35:50,073
My back hurts.

932
00:35:50,573 --> 00:35:53,307
This is a high-end spa shop.

933
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:55,240
- This is a fancy place. / - You bet.

934
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:57,073
This is for our 30th anniversary.

935
00:35:57,073 --> 00:35:58,907
I can't skimp out on the spa.

936
00:35:58,907 --> 00:36:00,740
- That's right. / - I can't.

937
00:36:03,073 --> 00:36:05,673
This place was the most expensive on our itinerary.

938
00:36:05,673 --> 00:36:07,573
- They gave us tea there. / - It's our 30th anniversary.

939
00:36:07,573 --> 00:36:09,307
We ought to be fancy for a day.

940
00:36:09,307 --> 00:36:11,273
- Of course, you should be. / - That's what I think.

941
00:36:11,273 --> 00:36:12,440
If my husband does that for me,

942
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:14,507
I would tell him that I love him right away.

943
00:36:15,007 --> 00:36:16,107
That's true.

944
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:18,607
We've never done this before we got married.

945
00:36:18,607 --> 00:36:20,473
It's our 1st time in 30 years.

946
00:36:20,673 --> 00:36:23,340
I won't be able to forget our trip to Kota Kinabalu.

947
00:36:26,507 --> 00:36:28,607
(Balu Tour, Yangrak's Day)

948
00:36:28,607 --> 00:36:33,407
(Kokol Poring-Poring Road)

949
00:36:33,873 --> 00:36:37,473
(45 minutes by car to Kokol Poring-Poring Road)

950
00:36:37,473 --> 00:36:38,407
Kokol Poring-Poring Road.

951
00:36:38,407 --> 00:36:41,673
- It was really nice. / - It takes some time to get there.

952
00:36:41,673 --> 00:36:43,140
But it's worth the time.

953
00:36:43,140 --> 00:36:45,640
(They arrive at their last destination)

954
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:48,040
- This was a long trip. / - You know how great places...

955
00:36:48,340 --> 00:36:50,207
Aren't accessible.

956
00:36:50,207 --> 00:36:51,940
The altitude here is over 800m.

957
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:53,640
It is.

958
00:36:53,940 --> 00:36:55,740
When the sun completely sets,

959
00:36:55,740 --> 00:36:57,140
we can see the night view.

960
00:36:57,140 --> 00:37:00,173
I heard that the view is indeed fantastic and splendid.

961
00:37:00,173 --> 00:37:02,340
The name of this area is called Kokol...

962
00:37:02,340 --> 00:37:04,373
It's not Podong-Podong. It's Kokol...

963
00:37:04,373 --> 00:37:06,773
- My gosh, look at that. / - It's Poring-Poring.

964
00:37:07,107 --> 00:37:08,273
Isn't the name pretty too?

965
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:14,707
(You can enjoy the sunset and the city lights)

966
00:37:15,607 --> 00:37:16,673
- Poring-Poring. / - My gosh.

967
00:37:16,673 --> 00:37:17,973
Is this a resort?

968
00:37:17,973 --> 00:37:20,073
It's at a high altitude.

969
00:37:20,073 --> 00:37:22,540
A lot of couples go there...

970
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:25,040
- I didn't know this existed. / - For dates.

971
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:27,473
My friend told me about this place.

972
00:37:27,473 --> 00:37:28,640
He recommended I go...

973
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:30,640
- And said it's not well known. / - To put it simply...

974
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:32,340
The locals go there for dates.

975
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:34,207
I can assure you.

976
00:37:34,207 --> 00:37:35,607
Koreans don't know this place.

977
00:37:35,607 --> 00:37:36,540
Are we the first ones?

978
00:37:36,540 --> 00:37:38,540
How did you find this place?

979
00:37:38,540 --> 00:37:39,840
My friend, Jeong Hyeon, told me.

980
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:41,107
He told me that...

981
00:37:41,773 --> 00:37:43,773
It'd be great if I took you here.

982
00:37:44,807 --> 00:37:47,273
(The restaurant was recommended by him)

983
00:37:47,907 --> 00:37:50,673
(The island was recommended by him)

984
00:37:50,673 --> 00:37:51,740
You should take him a photo.

985
00:37:51,740 --> 00:37:53,773
(Even the spa was recommended by his friend)

986
00:37:54,073 --> 00:37:55,873
I definitely got a lot of tips from my friend.

987
00:37:55,873 --> 00:37:57,640
I'll treat him to a meal.

988
00:37:57,640 --> 00:37:58,940
Thank you, Hyeon.

989
00:37:59,473 --> 00:38:00,807
Are you doing okay?

990
00:38:01,273 --> 00:38:03,107
Shouldn't we invite him?

991
00:38:03,107 --> 00:38:04,007
I'm getting curious.

992
00:38:04,007 --> 00:38:06,207
- He's mentioned a lot. / - It's like he's with you.

993
00:38:06,940 --> 00:38:09,340
I prepared today's itinerary for you.

994
00:38:09,673 --> 00:38:11,707
I bet you'll remember this for a long time.

995
00:38:11,707 --> 00:38:12,840
Especially this view.

996
00:38:13,407 --> 00:38:14,507
Thank you.

997
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:17,573
- You're the best. / - So many couples were there.

998
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:19,907
- Gosh, your belly... / - Yes?

999
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:24,473
- Doesn't this feel dependable? / - Yes, it's chubby.

1000
00:38:24,940 --> 00:38:25,940
Poring-Poring.

1001
00:38:25,940 --> 00:38:27,073
I mean...

1002
00:38:27,073 --> 00:38:28,540
Gosh, it's beautiful.

1003
00:38:28,540 --> 00:38:30,273
Not that many tourists know this place.

1004
00:38:30,707 --> 00:38:33,773
- It's a very useful tip. / - How pretty.

1005
00:38:33,773 --> 00:38:35,107
(The evening glow falls asleep)

1006
00:38:35,707 --> 00:38:38,873
(And the city lights wake up)

1007
00:38:38,873 --> 00:38:41,373
What do you think about my itinerary?

1008
00:38:41,373 --> 00:38:44,407
We've been married for 30 years,

1009
00:38:44,407 --> 00:38:46,507
but I think we've rarely had conversations

1010
00:38:46,507 --> 00:38:48,873
with such a nice night view

1011
00:38:48,873 --> 00:38:50,440
in this kind of good ambience.

1012
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:53,307
- Our busy schedule was an excuse. / - All the time...

1013
00:38:53,307 --> 00:38:57,240
Right. We'll be in our 60s and 70s soon.

1014
00:38:57,807 --> 00:38:59,673
I might feel vain

1015
00:38:59,673 --> 00:39:01,773
because I've only ever looked to the future.

1016
00:39:01,773 --> 00:39:04,273
- Let's be relaxed... / - Let's have this kind of leisure.

1017
00:39:04,273 --> 00:39:05,673
- In our lives from now on. / - We should.

1018
00:39:05,673 --> 00:39:08,040
When did you bring that puppy?

1019
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:12,373
- How cute. / - He kept following me.

1020
00:39:12,373 --> 00:39:13,273
He's dozing off.

1021
00:39:13,273 --> 00:39:14,273
He is.

1022
00:39:14,673 --> 00:39:16,307
Hey, over there...

1023
00:39:16,307 --> 00:39:19,473
Oh, there. I want to take a photo with you.

1024
00:39:19,473 --> 00:39:21,773
- Pictures are a must on a trip. / - Right.

1025
00:39:22,507 --> 00:39:23,840
- Let's go. / - Gosh, the wind.

1026
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:27,440
- He wants to join us. / - He's following me again.

1027
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:29,340
(How was today's trip?)

1028
00:39:29,340 --> 00:39:31,173
We went on a trip to Vietnam

1029
00:39:31,173 --> 00:39:32,807
on our 20th marriage anniversary.

1030
00:39:32,807 --> 00:39:35,240
We're on a trip after 10 years.

1031
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:40,273
I'm getting touched more as time passes.

1032
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:43,607
To be honest, we didn't get to spend time alone often.

1033
00:39:43,940 --> 00:39:47,873
Ever since we got back from our honeymoon,

1034
00:39:47,873 --> 00:39:49,640
he was really famous,

1035
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:51,640
so we didn't even get to see each other's faces.

1036
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:54,173
I ran my restaurant too.

1037
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:57,907
We were busy living our lives.

1038
00:39:58,140 --> 00:39:59,307
We were busy...

1039
00:40:00,073 --> 00:40:04,507
But this trip has given us a chance to look back.

1040
00:40:04,507 --> 00:40:06,107
I've come to think about how I want to

1041
00:40:06,107 --> 00:40:09,040
go for a massage and exercise with him.

1042
00:40:10,107 --> 00:40:12,007
I want to be good to him.

1043
00:40:12,007 --> 00:40:13,140
(She wishes to be better to him)

1044
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:16,940
- Let's hold hands. / - It's too childish. Let's do this.

1045
00:40:19,407 --> 00:40:20,973
How sweet.

1046
00:40:20,973 --> 00:40:23,873
We took a picture in that pose 30 years ago.

1047
00:40:23,873 --> 00:40:25,073
You did.

1048
00:40:25,073 --> 00:40:26,507
(Their unchanging love)

1049
00:40:28,507 --> 00:40:30,340
Gosh, how touching.

1050
00:40:30,340 --> 00:40:33,507
- It really is touching. / - That's a long time ago.

1051
00:40:34,073 --> 00:40:38,373
(Their unchanging love)

1052
00:40:38,740 --> 00:40:40,373
Since it's our 30th marriage anniversary...

1053
00:40:40,373 --> 00:40:42,307
- Having pictures is important. / - Let's take a photo.

1054
00:40:42,573 --> 00:40:44,873
- Open your eyes a little. / - The second day...

1055
00:40:44,873 --> 00:40:45,907
Is planned by Hyeonsuk.

1056
00:40:45,907 --> 00:40:47,707
I'd like to do something special.

1057
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:49,573
Good morning.

1058
00:40:49,573 --> 00:40:53,640
(The list of Hyeonsuk's trivial but certain happiness)

1059
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:54,773
It's coming up like that.

1060
00:40:54,773 --> 00:40:56,640
Since we sweat a lot...

1061
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:58,907
- It's delicious. / - Oh, that.

1062
00:40:59,973 --> 00:41:01,673
(Fighting heat with heat)

1063
00:41:01,673 --> 00:41:02,740
That's refreshing.

1064
00:41:02,740 --> 00:41:04,040
Your favorite...

1065
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:06,107
(She's prepared a romantic drink with the sunset)

1066
00:41:06,873 --> 00:41:09,207
Thank you for the past 30 years.

1067
00:41:09,607 --> 00:41:12,173
Is this a gift? An anniversary gift?

1068
00:41:12,740 --> 00:41:14,707
(Will it capture Hyeonsuk's heart?)

1069
00:41:15,007 --> 00:41:16,240
If you knew how to do all this,

1070
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:18,973
why didn't you do it the past 30 years?

1071
00:41:19,707 --> 00:41:22,173
(The final story of the couple in Kota Kinabalu)

1072
00:41:22,173 --> 00:41:24,007
Come this way. You're holding it wrong.

1073
00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:27,307
(Balu Tour, Hyeonsuk's Day)

1074
00:41:27,307 --> 00:41:29,507
Flip it.

1075
00:41:29,507 --> 00:41:33,040
(Sunday Market, snap tour, bak-kut-teh, dessert, sunset)

1076
00:41:34,673 --> 00:41:35,507
(9 a.m., the final day)

1077
00:41:35,507 --> 00:41:37,607
The weather is so nice today.

1078
00:41:38,373 --> 00:41:40,640
- Yangrak. / - It's good.

1079
00:41:40,973 --> 00:41:44,107
Today is my day. Paeng Hyeonsuk's Day.

1080
00:41:44,107 --> 00:41:47,373
Sunday Market is the romance of married women.

1081
00:41:47,373 --> 00:41:49,573
- That's a must. / - Indeed.

1082
00:41:49,573 --> 00:41:52,240
I think men get scared whenever women say

1083
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:53,373
they'll go shopping.

1084
00:41:53,373 --> 00:41:55,107
Since most men don't like shopping,

1085
00:41:55,107 --> 00:41:57,473
a lot of women tell their husbands to stay at a hotel.

1086
00:41:57,473 --> 00:41:58,640
I don't think that's the case for Hyungkyu.

1087
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:00,173
I love shopping.

1088
00:42:00,173 --> 00:42:01,573
He looks like he loves shopping.

1089
00:42:01,573 --> 00:42:04,773
Shopping is a way to expand myself.

1090
00:42:05,007 --> 00:42:06,807
He likes on-sale items.

1091
00:42:06,807 --> 00:42:08,173
- I love them. / - When it says, "On sale..."

1092
00:42:08,173 --> 00:42:10,273
- He has to go in that store. / - Right.

1093
00:42:10,273 --> 00:42:11,507
- It closes down... / - I wanted to sleep in.

1094
00:42:11,507 --> 00:42:14,673
At noon, but they have so many sales.

1095
00:42:14,673 --> 00:42:16,740
You can go shopping in Korea.

1096
00:42:16,740 --> 00:42:18,207
- Why would you do it here? / - I mean...

1097
00:42:18,207 --> 00:42:20,673
Buying local items and giving them

1098
00:42:20,673 --> 00:42:22,840
to our acquaintances as gifts is exotic.

1099
00:42:23,473 --> 00:42:24,640
- Now what? / - Smile!

1100
00:42:26,073 --> 00:42:27,107
That's right.

1101
00:42:27,107 --> 00:42:29,740
- Then... / - Stop. Smile.

1102
00:42:30,673 --> 00:42:34,473
If you look up close, Yangrak has wrinkles

1103
00:42:34,473 --> 00:42:36,307
in the middle of his forehead.

1104
00:42:36,307 --> 00:42:38,140
It means he doesn't like the idea.

1105
00:42:38,140 --> 00:42:39,140
But I really hope he smiles

1106
00:42:39,140 --> 00:42:41,840
instead of showing me those wrinkles.

1107
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:43,807
(Will he stay as the smiley husband today?)

1108
00:42:43,973 --> 00:42:46,673
Film a video of me opening the door.

1109
00:42:47,007 --> 00:42:48,540
- Do it already. / - I filmed it.

1110
00:42:48,540 --> 00:42:49,540
Smile.

1111
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:52,007
(An obedient smiling angel)

1112
00:42:52,707 --> 00:42:54,473
- Satisfied? / - Good.

1113
00:42:55,407 --> 00:42:57,073
- Hello, good morning. / - Good morning.

1114
00:42:57,607 --> 00:43:01,407
Please... Sunday Market.

1115
00:43:01,407 --> 00:43:02,440
Okay.

1116
00:43:03,607 --> 00:43:07,273
See? There aren't many people on the streets.

1117
00:43:07,273 --> 00:43:08,840
They must be resting since it's Sunday.

1118
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:11,707
It's great to wake up

1119
00:43:11,707 --> 00:43:14,173
and start our day earlier

1120
00:43:14,173 --> 00:43:15,840
when others are sleeping in.

1121
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:19,540
Middle-aged couples go around markets together

1122
00:43:19,540 --> 00:43:22,140
with a shopping basket.

1123
00:43:22,140 --> 00:43:24,407
I'm so envious of that.

1124
00:43:24,407 --> 00:43:28,207
Whenever I go grocery shopping,

1125
00:43:28,207 --> 00:43:30,340
you never accompany me.

1126
00:43:30,707 --> 00:43:33,507
You're not a top star anymore.

1127
00:43:33,507 --> 00:43:35,307
You've become ordinary now.

1128
00:43:35,307 --> 00:43:37,073
How could you say that?

1129
00:43:38,207 --> 00:43:40,473
- Goodness. / - I'm sorry.

1130
00:43:40,973 --> 00:43:42,973
Isn't it time you get used to the life now?

1131
00:43:42,973 --> 00:43:44,407
I'm still popular.

1132
00:43:45,207 --> 00:43:47,840
People live to 100 now, so things will work out.

1133
00:43:48,473 --> 00:43:51,740
We're on our way to Sunday Market...

1134
00:43:51,740 --> 00:43:54,373
- In a taxi right now. / - Right.

1135
00:43:54,373 --> 00:43:56,540
I'm curious what they'll have.

1136
00:43:56,540 --> 00:43:58,140
(The traditional market on Gaya Street)

1137
00:43:58,140 --> 00:43:59,507
Is it open only on Sundays?

1138
00:44:00,173 --> 00:44:02,440
That's why it's called Sunday Market.

1139
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:03,940
There must be meat.

1140
00:44:04,773 --> 00:44:07,973
Goodness, they have everything.

1141
00:44:07,973 --> 00:44:09,240
(Sunday Market sells all kinds of items)

1142
00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:13,973
So many people are here to shop.

1143
00:44:13,973 --> 00:44:15,340
- I know. / - It's packed.

1144
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:17,373
How lively.

1145
00:44:17,373 --> 00:44:20,040
This must be the start of the market.

1146
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:23,173
- It's the entrance. / - Hello, hi.

1147
00:44:23,373 --> 00:44:24,707
Good morning.

1148
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:26,640
Good morning.

1149
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:29,773
Good morning. Hi. Very beautiful.

1150
00:44:29,773 --> 00:44:32,073
- Thank you. / - Very nice.

1151
00:44:32,740 --> 00:44:35,373
Good morning. Hi.

1152
00:44:35,973 --> 00:44:37,473
What's this?

1153
00:44:37,473 --> 00:44:38,907
(Yangrak is showing off his wrinkles)

1154
00:44:41,740 --> 00:44:43,440
He's tired already.

1155
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:44,873
Yangrak, come quick.

1156
00:44:45,940 --> 00:44:47,107
(He lost his smile after 10 minutes)

1157
00:44:47,107 --> 00:44:49,673
They're selling herbal medicine.

1158
00:44:49,673 --> 00:44:51,840
Let's have some fruit juice.

1159
00:44:52,140 --> 00:44:53,940
(A popular store in the Sunday Market)

1160
00:44:54,007 --> 00:44:55,807
Gosh, look at those fruits.

1161
00:44:55,807 --> 00:44:57,507
- What's that? / - Goodness.

1162
00:44:57,607 --> 00:44:59,773
- That was so good. / - It's amazing.

1163
00:44:59,773 --> 00:45:02,473
- I love that. / - Isn't that watermelon?

1164
00:45:02,773 --> 00:45:03,873
She's making juice.

1165
00:45:03,873 --> 00:45:05,440
- Right on the spot. / - I know.

1166
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:07,973
They blend fruits right on the spot.

1167
00:45:07,973 --> 00:45:09,873
They make watermelon juice like that since it's hot.

1168
00:45:09,873 --> 00:45:11,640
They grind it on the spot like that?

1169
00:45:11,640 --> 00:45:14,707
- You don't need a cup. / - She grinds the inside of it.

1170
00:45:15,140 --> 00:45:17,673
I'm going to try and make one at home.

1171
00:45:17,673 --> 00:45:18,840
How much is it?

1172
00:45:19,240 --> 00:45:21,807
- 10. / - 10 ringgit?

1173
00:45:21,807 --> 00:45:23,973
- It's only $3? / - That whole watermelon?

1174
00:45:23,973 --> 00:45:25,607
- $3? / - It's $6 for 2.

1175
00:45:25,607 --> 00:45:28,007
- It's refreshing and nice. / - We're indeed...

1176
00:45:28,007 --> 00:45:29,940
- A generous couple. / - Gosh.

1177
00:45:29,940 --> 00:45:31,507
- A watermelon each. / - A whole watermelon each.

1178
00:45:31,507 --> 00:45:34,307
- It's not a piece of it. / - You're right.

1179
00:45:34,907 --> 00:45:37,573
It tastes like Korean watermelons

1180
00:45:37,573 --> 00:45:39,607
but I think it's sweeter.

1181
00:45:39,607 --> 00:45:41,940
It's perfect to take pictures too.

1182
00:45:43,007 --> 00:45:44,507
I want to buy one of them.

1183
00:45:44,707 --> 00:45:47,640
- Buy it. / - They ward off misfortune.

1184
00:45:47,873 --> 00:45:51,040
That's nonsense. It's only a superstition.

1185
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:52,340
- Go ahead. / - I think we have a lot of...

1186
00:45:52,340 --> 00:45:55,040
- Bad luck in our house. Come on. / - Go buy it.

1187
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:56,173
(His wrinkles start to appear again)

1188
00:45:56,173 --> 00:45:57,673
- Hello. / - He's getting more and more...

1189
00:45:57,673 --> 00:45:58,807
How much?

1190
00:45:59,940 --> 00:46:01,407
1 for 10 ringgit, 2 for 15.

1191
00:46:01,407 --> 00:46:05,240
- One, ten. / - Two, fifteen.

1192
00:46:05,240 --> 00:46:06,940
Two, two.

1193
00:46:06,940 --> 00:46:07,940
(She hands her 5 ringgit)

1194
00:46:09,507 --> 00:46:11,273
- That's not right. / - What?

1195
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:16,240
Just multiply it by 3. 10 ringgit is $3.

1196
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:19,540
- Remember 10 ringgit is worth... / - It's worth $3.

1197
00:46:19,540 --> 00:46:20,873
- Right, it's worth $3. / - Okay.

1198
00:46:20,873 --> 00:46:22,773
I'm confused because it's not Korea.

1199
00:46:22,773 --> 00:46:24,173
It's sickening.

1200
00:46:24,173 --> 00:46:27,907
Let's split up for an hour and meet over there.

1201
00:46:27,907 --> 00:46:29,473
- Don't be late. / - Let's meet after an hour.

1202
00:46:29,473 --> 00:46:32,073
Okay. Stand and wait here.

1203
00:46:33,307 --> 00:46:35,207
Why do you want me to stand and wait here?

1204
00:46:35,207 --> 00:46:37,207
Stay there. I'll be right back.

1205
00:46:37,673 --> 00:46:38,907
Let's go.

1206
00:46:40,273 --> 00:46:41,340
Hello.

1207
00:46:41,340 --> 00:46:43,040
In the end, they part ways.

1208
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:44,807
He shouldn't disappear like that.

1209
00:46:46,373 --> 00:46:48,973
- Hello. / - I like hand-crafted items.

1210
00:46:48,973 --> 00:46:50,040
I should buy some souvenirs.

1211
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:52,807
You can buy those in Korea but it's too expensive.

1212
00:46:52,807 --> 00:46:54,640
- Right. / - These look...

1213
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:56,807
Refreshing and nice.

1214
00:46:57,073 --> 00:46:59,573
This and these.

1215
00:46:59,573 --> 00:47:00,840
How much?

1216
00:47:01,073 --> 00:47:03,207
- I want a discount. / - Okay.

1217
00:47:03,207 --> 00:47:06,307
- Discount, okay? / - Okay.

1218
00:47:06,340 --> 00:47:08,273
- How much is it? / - So 55.

1219
00:47:08,573 --> 00:47:09,873
55.

1220
00:47:10,307 --> 00:47:11,840
- You dropped it to 55? / - A little more.

1221
00:47:11,873 --> 00:47:13,440
(This time, she's after a bag)

1222
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:15,840
Discount?

1223
00:47:15,840 --> 00:47:17,240
25.

1224
00:47:17,240 --> 00:47:19,807
I want more discount.

1225
00:47:20,407 --> 00:47:22,440
- A little... / - How much do you want?

1226
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:24,340
How much? 20.

1227
00:47:24,840 --> 00:47:27,140
20 for this. And this one...

1228
00:47:27,140 --> 00:47:28,807
One more.

1229
00:47:29,640 --> 00:47:31,540
(Meanwhile, Yangrak heads somewhere)

1230
00:47:32,807 --> 00:47:35,007
(Gosh, it's hot)

1231
00:47:36,540 --> 00:47:38,807
(He wanders around to find a place to avoid the heat)

1232
00:47:40,040 --> 00:47:41,473
(He can tell it's a shelter for exhausted men)

1233
00:47:41,473 --> 00:47:43,207
Look at them all.

1234
00:47:43,573 --> 00:47:45,073
There are a lot of men.

1235
00:47:45,073 --> 00:47:47,940
Here's what I read about the stress rankings for men.

1236
00:47:47,940 --> 00:47:49,907
They're most stressed out when they have lost

1237
00:47:49,907 --> 00:47:51,407
their country or family.

1238
00:47:51,407 --> 00:47:52,907
5th on that list is shopping.

1239
00:47:52,907 --> 00:47:55,207
- It's that stressful? / - I didn't know that.

1240
00:47:56,973 --> 00:47:58,740
(He enjoys his time alone for a while)

1241
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:04,207
Isn't he lying directly under the sunlight?

1242
00:48:04,207 --> 00:48:06,673
He looks so much brighter now though.

1243
00:48:06,673 --> 00:48:09,173
The wind was blowing gently.

1244
00:48:09,173 --> 00:48:11,073
(He rests for a moment like that)

1245
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:14,740
- Lemon? / - Yes.

1246
00:48:14,740 --> 00:48:15,973
Lemon juice.

1247
00:48:17,007 --> 00:48:19,640
(He orders iced lemon tea and iced chocolate)

1248
00:48:21,707 --> 00:48:24,140
(He chooses to drink the lemon tea)

1249
00:48:25,007 --> 00:48:26,640
(How refreshing)

1250
00:48:28,040 --> 00:48:29,507
(He returns to the rest area with the beverages)

1251
00:48:30,907 --> 00:48:33,007
I found him. He's over there.

1252
00:48:34,473 --> 00:48:35,707
Yangrak.

1253
00:48:37,207 --> 00:48:38,440
Choi Yangrak.

1254
00:48:38,473 --> 00:48:40,407
(Is she already finished?)

1255
00:48:41,240 --> 00:48:42,640
- Are you finished? / - I'm done.

1256
00:48:43,007 --> 00:48:44,540
- Give it to me. / - Here you are.

1257
00:48:44,540 --> 00:48:46,840
- I want that one. / - This is for me.

1258
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:48,640
This is for me. Yours is chocolate.

1259
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:50,607
But I like that one.

1260
00:48:51,273 --> 00:48:54,173
- I thought you'd like chocolate. / - No, I like this one.

1261
00:48:54,173 --> 00:48:56,373
You came earlier than I thought.

1262
00:48:56,873 --> 00:48:58,707
- Have a seat here. / - It's too sunny there.

1263
00:48:58,707 --> 00:49:00,873
- Why do you want me to sit there? / - It's not sunny.

1264
00:49:00,873 --> 00:49:02,307
It's so hot.

1265
00:49:03,340 --> 00:49:05,707
My legs hurt. I'll just sit here like this.

1266
00:49:06,173 --> 00:49:08,407
- Why don't you just sit here? / - It's cooler here.

1267
00:49:08,407 --> 00:49:09,807
It's delicious.

1268
00:49:10,973 --> 00:49:12,240
What did you buy?

1269
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:13,640
I bought three bags.

1270
00:49:13,673 --> 00:49:16,540
One is for Hana, and one is for the manager.

1271
00:49:16,540 --> 00:49:18,707
- I bought a hat and... / - She bought a lot of things.

1272
00:49:18,707 --> 00:49:19,707
Even if you buy a lot of things,

1273
00:49:19,707 --> 00:49:21,107
it's not expensive there.

1274
00:49:21,107 --> 00:49:23,973
- This can contain things. / - So, how much is this?

1275
00:49:23,973 --> 00:49:25,440
- Let me see. / - 55 ringgit.

1276
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:27,873
- What a bargain. / - They are so pretty.

1277
00:49:27,873 --> 00:49:31,307
- These are tea coasters. / - You can play Pogs.

1278
00:49:31,773 --> 00:49:33,640
These are tea coasters.

1279
00:49:34,273 --> 00:49:35,540
(What are you doing?)

1280
00:49:35,540 --> 00:49:37,207
They're tea coasters.

1281
00:49:37,207 --> 00:49:40,340
Let's go. That was a nice shopping.

1282
00:49:41,107 --> 00:49:42,773
I bought things at a reasonable price.

1283
00:49:43,273 --> 00:49:44,340
Thank you.

1284
00:49:44,340 --> 00:49:46,473
(Summer health food, bak-kut-teh)

1285
00:49:46,473 --> 00:49:47,773
- Bak-kut-teh? / - Bak-kut-teh.

1286
00:49:47,773 --> 00:49:49,507
- Bak-kut-teh. / - It's health food.

1287
00:49:49,507 --> 00:49:50,840
- Health food. / - I wonder what it is like.

1288
00:49:50,840 --> 00:49:53,173
It's cooked with pork ribs.

1289
00:49:54,107 --> 00:49:55,607
That's right.

1290
00:49:57,507 --> 00:50:00,107
It looks delicious.

1291
00:50:00,873 --> 00:50:02,940
It looks very delicious.

1292
00:50:03,340 --> 00:50:06,240
It's simmered with medicinal herbs

1293
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:07,873
so it gets rid of the odor from the pork.

1294
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:14,240
They cook pork and get rid of the odor

1295
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:16,107
and they cook the broth separately.

1296
00:50:16,107 --> 00:50:19,440
The meat and the broth are served together,

1297
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:20,740
and that's bak-kut-teh.

1298
00:50:21,707 --> 00:50:24,040
As you know, we've been sweating a lot.

1299
00:50:24,273 --> 00:50:26,740
There's a saying, "Fight fire with fire."

1300
00:50:26,740 --> 00:50:29,040
We should recharge our body with the hot broth

1301
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:30,440
when we sweat a lot.

1302
00:50:30,440 --> 00:50:33,273
Main menu and side menu.

1303
00:50:33,807 --> 00:50:36,973
- This one. This one. / - Okay. Okay.

1304
00:50:37,473 --> 00:50:39,207
- What is this? / - That looks delicious.

1305
00:50:39,207 --> 00:50:41,607
That's a fried dish. It's dry bak-kut-teh.

1306
00:50:42,107 --> 00:50:44,140
So there are different kinds.

1307
00:50:44,473 --> 00:50:47,673
- How about we order rice? / - Shall we order rice?

1308
00:50:47,673 --> 00:50:49,640
Two rice, please.

1309
00:50:49,640 --> 00:50:51,840
- Rice. / - Two bowls of rice cost 90 cents?

1310
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:54,373
It's already ready.

1311
00:50:54,373 --> 00:50:55,707
(Boiling bak-kut-teh shows up)

1312
00:50:55,707 --> 00:50:58,740
It smells like medicinal herbs.

1313
00:50:59,840 --> 00:51:01,640
It looks like short rib soup.

1314
00:51:01,640 --> 00:51:03,507
- Here's a rib. / - It does look like short rib soup.

1315
00:51:03,507 --> 00:51:06,607
It's like short rib soup with pork belly in it.

1316
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:09,240
There is pork in it.

1317
00:51:09,873 --> 00:51:11,607
- The grease is well-drained. / - It's pork belly.

1318
00:51:11,607 --> 00:51:13,040
The grease is all drained out.

1319
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:16,107
How does the broth taste?

1320
00:51:19,173 --> 00:51:20,373
It tastes so good.

1321
00:51:22,007 --> 00:51:24,840
It has a clean aftertaste. It's rich like short rib soup.

1322
00:51:24,840 --> 00:51:27,340
- There are spices in it. / - Yes.

1323
00:51:27,340 --> 00:51:28,707
It tastes unique.

1324
00:51:28,707 --> 00:51:30,040
It's probably because of the medicinal herbs.

1325
00:51:30,040 --> 00:51:33,007
The pork doesn't smell at all.

1326
00:51:33,540 --> 00:51:34,807
Let me try one piece too.

1327
00:51:35,207 --> 00:51:36,473
We have to eat off the bone.

1328
00:51:40,907 --> 00:51:46,973
(They hold the ribs and pick the meat off the bones)

1329
00:51:48,007 --> 00:51:51,307
It's tasty. It's well-cooked.

1330
00:51:51,307 --> 00:51:54,973
It's chewy but soft when I swallow it.

1331
00:51:55,273 --> 00:51:57,273
I'm sure Koreans would love this dish.

1332
00:51:57,273 --> 00:51:58,773
You have to eat ribs with your hands.

1333
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:00,573
It's delicious.

1334
00:52:00,707 --> 00:52:01,773
It's so good.

1335
00:52:04,773 --> 00:52:06,407
(She keeps eating)

1336
00:52:06,407 --> 00:52:09,373
After eating the meat, you can eat rice with the broth.

1337
00:52:09,373 --> 00:52:11,573
It will be very filling.

1338
00:52:12,073 --> 00:52:14,473
- It's tasty. / - I suddenly feel...

1339
00:52:15,173 --> 00:52:17,473
15 years younger.

1340
00:52:17,473 --> 00:52:19,307
I wish we could actually be younger.

1341
00:52:20,107 --> 00:52:23,240
(Dry bak-kut-teh braised in black sauce)

1342
00:52:23,940 --> 00:52:26,540
(Dry bak-kut-teh, $3.90)

1343
00:52:27,840 --> 00:52:29,173
(How does dry bak-kut-teh taste?)

1344
00:52:29,173 --> 00:52:30,340
How does it taste?

1345
00:52:31,907 --> 00:52:34,707
This is really good.

1346
00:52:34,707 --> 00:52:36,740
It tastes like black bean noodles

1347
00:52:36,740 --> 00:52:39,007
cooked with pork instead of noodles.

1348
00:52:39,007 --> 00:52:40,507
- You're right. / - It looks delicious.

1349
00:52:40,507 --> 00:52:43,207
The sauce looks so good.

1350
00:52:43,207 --> 00:52:44,373
This is very delicious too.

1351
00:52:44,773 --> 00:52:47,940
It tastes familiar but there's meat instead of noodles.

1352
00:52:48,807 --> 00:52:51,573
The sauce is spicy. It should go well with rice.

1353
00:52:51,573 --> 00:52:52,873
Let's eat it with rice.

1354
00:52:52,873 --> 00:52:55,740
- It must be good with plain rice. / - It looks so good.

1355
00:52:55,740 --> 00:52:56,873
Take a spoonful of rice...

1356
00:52:57,540 --> 00:53:00,207
And put a piece of meat on it.

1357
00:53:00,207 --> 00:53:01,973
It's like black bean rice.

1358
00:53:02,940 --> 00:53:04,407
(Cheers)

1359
00:53:06,107 --> 00:53:09,573
(They put the food in their mouths)

1360
00:53:10,340 --> 00:53:11,573
It's tasty.

1361
00:53:11,573 --> 00:53:13,207
(It gives me power!)

1362
00:53:13,207 --> 00:53:14,440
Try this too.

1363
00:53:16,373 --> 00:53:17,973
This is what you call health food.

1364
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:20,773
(He takes a piece of meat)

1365
00:53:20,773 --> 00:53:22,240
It's very well-cooked.

1366
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:23,540
(The meat tastes amazing with plain rice)

1367
00:53:23,540 --> 00:53:25,707
It's well-cooked, yet it's firm.

1368
00:53:27,140 --> 00:53:29,207
(Yangrak loves the Malaysian health food)

1369
00:53:29,207 --> 00:53:30,240
Is it a bit spicy?

1370
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:32,440
- It's spicy because of the chili. / - It looks delicious.

1371
00:53:34,207 --> 00:53:37,373
Yangrak becomes silent when he likes the food.

1372
00:53:37,373 --> 00:53:39,407
He just focuses on eating the food.

1373
00:53:39,407 --> 00:53:41,107
I'm from Chungcheong-do.

1374
00:53:41,107 --> 00:53:42,240
People from Chungcheong-do

1375
00:53:42,240 --> 00:53:43,607
don't comment right away.

1376
00:53:43,607 --> 00:53:45,440
Sometimes I comment on the food the next day.

1377
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:48,373
- The night after. / - "Lunch yesterday was good."

1378
00:53:49,040 --> 00:53:51,140
I talk like that.

1379
00:53:52,707 --> 00:53:57,107
(Yangrak is fully charged)

1380
00:53:57,840 --> 00:54:00,240
It's the wrong way round.

1381
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:04,373
(Snap tour)

1382
00:54:04,373 --> 00:54:08,273
As we age, we get wrinkles and look older.

1383
00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:11,740
I'd like to take a lot of pictures before I look older.

1384
00:54:11,740 --> 00:54:13,773
When I search our names on the internet,

1385
00:54:13,773 --> 00:54:15,340
there aren't many nice pictures of us.

1386
00:54:15,340 --> 00:54:16,840
Because we are comedians

1387
00:54:16,840 --> 00:54:18,807
who are supposed to be funny...

1388
00:54:18,807 --> 00:54:21,340
- We don't have nice pictures. / - Only funny photos.

1389
00:54:21,340 --> 00:54:22,540
Not many.

1390
00:54:22,540 --> 00:54:25,473
Of course, it doesn't matter

1391
00:54:25,473 --> 00:54:27,673
how people think when we work...

1392
00:54:28,407 --> 00:54:29,873
But to our children,

1393
00:54:29,873 --> 00:54:32,707
I'm a mother and Yangrak is a father.

1394
00:54:33,173 --> 00:54:36,240
I'd like to take pictures that will make

1395
00:54:36,240 --> 00:54:39,640
our children think we're cool people as well.

1396
00:54:40,573 --> 00:54:42,107
Why do you like taking pictures so much?

1397
00:54:42,107 --> 00:54:43,340
Because I'm pretty.

1398
00:54:43,573 --> 00:54:45,640
(Hyeonsuk likes taking pictures because she's pretty)

1399
00:54:45,640 --> 00:54:48,040
You don't like it because you're ugly.

1400
00:54:48,973 --> 00:54:50,907
I said that on purpose.

1401
00:54:50,907 --> 00:54:54,073
Don't focus on the face.

1402
00:54:54,073 --> 00:54:55,573
Look at this.

1403
00:54:55,573 --> 00:54:58,940
- Like a shadow. / - It's about the atmosphere.

1404
00:54:59,507 --> 00:55:01,240
I hired a photographer.

1405
00:55:01,240 --> 00:55:02,873
He is our tour guide

1406
00:55:02,873 --> 00:55:06,007
and takes pictures for us for the whole day.

1407
00:55:06,007 --> 00:55:08,440
He makes a photo album for us too. It's $100 in total.

1408
00:55:08,440 --> 00:55:09,640
It's a good deal, isn't it?

1409
00:55:09,640 --> 00:55:10,707
(In the exotic city, Kota Kinabalu)

1410
00:55:11,107 --> 00:55:12,807
(They look like locals)

1411
00:55:13,607 --> 00:55:16,673
(And take some proper photos)

1412
00:55:17,307 --> 00:55:18,807
(His legs go shaky while posing)

1413
00:55:18,807 --> 00:55:21,107
Smile. I told you to smile.

1414
00:55:21,373 --> 00:55:23,940
(It's romantic as if they're on their honeymoon)

1415
00:55:24,407 --> 00:55:26,640
(Will they successfully take a kissing picture?)

1416
00:55:27,473 --> 00:55:30,840
We're now going to Universiti Malaysia Sabah.

1417
00:55:30,840 --> 00:55:32,407
It's a university.

1418
00:55:32,907 --> 00:55:35,573
It's called UMS.

1419
00:55:35,573 --> 00:55:37,207
- Do you see that over there? / - Yes.

1420
00:55:37,207 --> 00:55:39,273
That's a mosque inside the university.

1421
00:55:39,273 --> 00:55:41,273
Universiti Malaysia Sabah has...

1422
00:55:41,273 --> 00:55:43,773
- A huge campus. / - It was so big.

1423
00:55:43,773 --> 00:55:46,073
- All the way to that beach. / - That's their campus?

1424
00:55:46,073 --> 00:55:47,440
- Is that the campus? / - Yes.

1425
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:49,140
I thought it was a castle.

1426
00:55:49,140 --> 00:55:52,240
It looks nicer in the picture if you stand on it.

1427
00:55:52,240 --> 00:55:54,040
- You want me to stand up here? / - Yes.

1428
00:55:54,040 --> 00:55:56,007
Hang on a second. Goodness.

1429
00:55:56,007 --> 00:55:57,607
Could you help me too?

1430
00:55:58,473 --> 00:55:59,640
Good.

1431
00:55:59,640 --> 00:56:02,640
Why can't we take pictures in a comfortable position?

1432
00:56:02,640 --> 00:56:05,640
Your expressions will be in the shot. 1, 2, 3.

1433
00:56:05,640 --> 00:56:08,240
- It's so uncomfortable. / - Smile!

1434
00:56:09,573 --> 00:56:12,107
Keep your eyes open. Don't blink.

1435
00:56:13,107 --> 00:56:14,940
- It's a great picture. / - It looks nice, right?

1436
00:56:14,940 --> 00:56:16,607
- Could you make a heart gesture? / - Okay.

1437
00:56:16,607 --> 00:56:17,607
Am I not in the picture?

1438
00:56:18,040 --> 00:56:20,307
You're also in the picture as the background.

1439
00:56:20,307 --> 00:56:22,773
As the background? Are only my shoulders shown?

1440
00:56:23,273 --> 00:56:24,573
- 1, 2, 3. / - Darn it.

1441
00:56:25,740 --> 00:56:27,340
(On snap tour, they focus more on the background)

1442
00:56:27,340 --> 00:56:28,473
Look at Yangrak's face.

1443
00:56:29,573 --> 00:56:31,807
Could you pose like this? Exactly.

1444
00:56:32,340 --> 00:56:34,040
He tells us everything.

1445
00:56:34,040 --> 00:56:36,340
We don't have to think of how to pose ourselves.

1446
00:56:36,340 --> 00:56:37,873
- He tells us everything. / - Could you stand still?

1447
00:56:37,873 --> 00:56:40,007
Come on. Stop trying to be funny.

1448
00:56:40,007 --> 00:56:42,707
Stop trying to be funny. Take it seriously.

1449
00:56:42,707 --> 00:56:44,040
(Embarrassed)

1450
00:56:44,040 --> 00:56:45,307
Are you kidding me?

1451
00:56:46,907 --> 00:56:49,407
Stop trying to be funny. It's our 30th anniversary.

1452
00:56:49,407 --> 00:56:50,940
- They have to take photos. / - It's our anniversary.

1453
00:56:50,940 --> 00:56:51,940
Do it properly.

1454
00:56:52,873 --> 00:56:54,107
Try to look like a model.

1455
00:56:54,973 --> 00:56:55,840
1, 2, 3.

1456
00:56:55,840 --> 00:56:57,873
(She's indeed a former model)

1457
00:57:01,473 --> 00:57:03,173
I used to be a model.

1458
00:57:03,173 --> 00:57:04,407
(Thanks to the former model, the shoot goes smoothly)

1459
00:57:05,640 --> 00:57:08,307
(This is how you model)

1460
00:57:11,673 --> 00:57:13,373
(Since we're taking pictures)

1461
00:57:15,473 --> 00:57:17,873
(Shall we kiss?)

1462
00:57:17,873 --> 00:57:19,940
- How sweet. / - You scared me.

1463
00:57:20,507 --> 00:57:21,907
(What are you doing?)

1464
00:57:24,273 --> 00:57:25,940
(They're so meant to be)

1465
00:57:26,973 --> 00:57:28,907
(It's a perfectly staged picture)

1466
00:57:28,907 --> 00:57:31,573
Yangrak is very shy.

1467
00:57:31,973 --> 00:57:35,107
It's been 30 years since we got married in 1988.

1468
00:57:35,107 --> 00:57:37,073
It's been 30 years already.

1469
00:57:37,073 --> 00:57:39,073
- How sweet. / - Time flew.

1470
00:57:42,073 --> 00:57:44,073
We were posing just like back then.

1471
00:57:44,373 --> 00:57:48,007
(Today's bride, Hyeonsuk)

1472
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:53,040
(Today's groom, Yangrak)

1473
00:57:54,273 --> 00:57:55,907
They're posing just like in the picture.

1474
00:57:57,940 --> 00:57:59,173
(They take their wedding picture again)

1475
00:57:59,173 --> 00:58:00,240
It must be very meaningful

1476
00:58:00,240 --> 00:58:02,940
to take pictures just like 30 years ago.

1477
00:58:02,940 --> 00:58:05,107
We were re-enacting the pictures.

1478
00:58:05,973 --> 00:58:07,707
(They go to a beach for a new theme)

1479
00:58:09,107 --> 00:58:11,240
(Yangrak holds the swing for her)

1480
00:58:13,607 --> 00:58:15,507
Are you ready? Shall we start?

1481
00:58:15,507 --> 00:58:17,207
(They're just like newlyweds)

1482
00:58:19,773 --> 00:58:20,907
This is fun.

1483
00:58:24,373 --> 00:58:26,307
(Hyeonsuk gets more and more excited)

1484
00:58:27,040 --> 00:58:28,807
(While Yangrak gets more exhausted)

1485
00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:30,440
Go!

1486
00:58:30,807 --> 00:58:33,040
Don't come back!

1487
00:58:34,173 --> 00:58:35,207
Go away!

1488
00:58:37,273 --> 00:58:38,273
Why did you come back again?

1489
00:58:38,473 --> 00:58:39,540
Go away!

1490
00:58:40,273 --> 00:58:41,973
(No matter how hard he pushes)

1491
00:58:41,973 --> 00:58:44,140
(She always comes back)

1492
00:58:45,473 --> 00:58:46,673
We're going to take a kissing picture.

1493
00:58:47,307 --> 00:58:49,740
They need to succeed.

1494
00:58:49,740 --> 00:58:51,240
- They failed earlier. / - Here we go.

1495
00:58:52,840 --> 00:58:55,040
(They get excited)

1496
00:58:55,107 --> 00:58:56,707
1, 2, 3, 4.

1497
00:58:57,507 --> 00:59:00,207
(Under the romantic soap bubbles)

1498
00:59:00,207 --> 00:59:02,673
This must look great in the picture.

1499
00:59:03,373 --> 00:59:04,740
It's so pretty.

1500
00:59:04,740 --> 00:59:08,307
(They travel back in time to their newlywed days)

1501
00:59:11,540 --> 00:59:14,240
(They successfully kiss as well)

1502
00:59:15,807 --> 00:59:17,873
(They're at their happiest)

1503
00:59:19,407 --> 00:59:21,207
All kinds of thoughts were running through my head.

1504
00:59:21,207 --> 00:59:21,973
(How did you feel about the wedding snap tour?)

1505
00:59:21,973 --> 00:59:25,073
I don't know why I posed like that 30 years ago.

1506
00:59:25,473 --> 00:59:27,307
It's so hard to pose like that now.

1507
00:59:27,307 --> 00:59:29,307
(Us from 30 years ago and us now)

1508
00:59:29,307 --> 00:59:31,440
I haven't changed.

1509
00:59:31,440 --> 00:59:32,773
But my wife

1510
00:59:32,773 --> 00:59:34,640
used to be very pretty when she was young.

1511
00:59:34,640 --> 00:59:35,440
I was sad

1512
00:59:35,440 --> 00:59:37,140
to realize everyone gets old as time goes by.

1513
00:59:37,140 --> 00:59:38,240
(Seeing you change as time goes by)

1514
00:59:39,407 --> 00:59:41,140
I think you've gained a lot of weight.

1515
00:59:41,140 --> 00:59:42,573
You're so heavy.

1516
00:59:44,007 --> 00:59:45,373
Stop saying funny things.

1517
00:59:47,340 --> 00:59:49,673
(They appreciate that they can still laugh together)

1518
00:59:49,673 --> 00:59:51,573
It reminded me of the memories.

1519
00:59:52,073 --> 00:59:55,140
I didn't know 30 years have passed so fast.

1520
00:59:56,207 --> 00:59:57,907
The fact that I think the time passed fast...

1521
00:59:57,907 --> 01:00:00,307
- Means I was happy. / - 30 years.

1522
01:00:01,240 --> 01:00:03,473
He's more than just a husband.

1523
01:00:03,773 --> 01:00:06,140
Both my parents passed away early.

1524
01:00:07,907 --> 01:00:08,940
He's my...

1525
01:00:09,807 --> 01:00:11,907
To me, he's like my parent.

1526
01:00:12,173 --> 01:00:13,873
He's like my mom and dad.

1527
01:00:13,873 --> 01:00:15,073
(He's become someone she can always rely on)

1528
01:00:15,073 --> 01:00:16,773
He's like my brother.

1529
01:00:17,040 --> 01:00:19,773
He supports me in many different ways.

1530
01:00:20,007 --> 01:00:21,740
(I don't want to shed tears)

1531
01:00:21,740 --> 01:00:23,507
So I'm very thankful to him.

1532
01:00:25,573 --> 01:00:28,873
I was worried she might say

1533
01:00:28,873 --> 01:00:32,007
it has been a horrible 30 years,

1534
01:00:32,007 --> 01:00:34,040
but she said, "30 years have passed so fast."

1535
01:00:34,507 --> 01:00:36,273
I didn't expect her to say that.

1536
01:00:36,273 --> 01:00:38,240
It actually made me feel good.

1537
01:00:38,640 --> 01:00:41,107
I'm so grateful that she thinks so.

1538
01:00:41,840 --> 01:00:43,073
1, 2, 3.

1539
01:00:44,240 --> 01:00:46,373
- What a nice picture. / - I'll make us...

1540
01:00:46,373 --> 01:00:50,040
Have only fun and good times.

1541
01:00:52,307 --> 01:00:54,073
(Balu Tour, Hyeonsuk's Day)

1542
01:00:54,073 --> 01:00:57,507
(Dessert)

1543
01:00:57,507 --> 01:01:00,173
- This is... / - It's an Indian restaurant.

1544
01:01:00,173 --> 01:01:01,640
I want to drink that.

1545
01:01:01,640 --> 01:01:02,773
I want to eat that too.

1546
01:01:02,773 --> 01:01:04,307
That looks delicious too.

1547
01:01:04,307 --> 01:01:06,440
- It must be Indian. Yes, roti. / - Roti?

1548
01:01:06,440 --> 01:01:08,307
- That's delicious. / - I know that.

1549
01:01:08,307 --> 01:01:09,840
- I want to eat roti. / - Roti.

1550
01:01:09,840 --> 01:01:11,473
Hello. There he is.

1551
01:01:13,040 --> 01:01:14,307
My daughter...

1552
01:01:14,307 --> 01:01:15,540
"My daughter."

1553
01:01:15,607 --> 01:01:18,007
Menu... Strongly recommended it.

1554
01:01:18,207 --> 01:01:19,307
"Strongly recommended it."

1555
01:01:19,973 --> 01:01:21,107
"Strongly recommended it."

1556
01:01:21,740 --> 01:01:23,473
I want roti tissue.

1557
01:01:24,207 --> 01:01:26,473
(I'd like to have this one)

1558
01:01:27,873 --> 01:01:29,840
- How do they make it? / - It's usually...

1559
01:01:29,840 --> 01:01:31,840
- Made thin. / - Just show them pictures.

1560
01:01:31,840 --> 01:01:33,473
They bake it.

1561
01:01:33,640 --> 01:01:34,873
Right.

1562
01:01:35,040 --> 01:01:36,373
That's how you make roti.

1563
01:01:36,973 --> 01:01:38,273
It's so interesting.

1564
01:01:38,573 --> 01:01:41,007
- It already looks tasty. / - It's really thin.

1565
01:01:41,007 --> 01:01:42,907
- It's as thin as a paper. / - He puts butter on it.

1566
01:01:42,907 --> 01:01:45,573
- He puts butter on it. / - It looks delicious.

1567
01:01:45,973 --> 01:01:48,673
It smells really nice.

1568
01:01:48,673 --> 01:01:50,540
It's nutty and sweet.

1569
01:01:50,540 --> 01:01:53,073
(He sprinkles some salt)

1570
01:01:55,040 --> 01:01:57,873
(And bakes it until the dough is golden brown)

1571
01:01:57,873 --> 01:01:59,807
Goodness, look at it.

1572
01:02:00,073 --> 01:02:03,007
(He rolls it into a tower that's 1m tall)

1573
01:02:03,007 --> 01:02:04,073
He rolls it afterward.

1574
01:02:04,073 --> 01:02:05,473
I see.

1575
01:02:05,940 --> 01:02:08,040
So it's empty inside.

1576
01:02:12,907 --> 01:02:15,907
(Amazed)

1577
01:02:16,207 --> 01:02:18,073
- Wow. / - It's so big.

1578
01:02:19,140 --> 01:02:20,340
(It looks overwhelming)

1579
01:02:20,340 --> 01:02:22,607
That dish would make you feel good.

1580
01:02:23,373 --> 01:02:24,573
It's so tall.

1581
01:02:24,573 --> 01:02:26,440
How did you make this?

1582
01:02:26,440 --> 01:02:27,707
It looks cool, doesn't it?

1583
01:02:27,707 --> 01:02:29,573
(Roti tissue is incredibly tall)

1584
01:02:29,573 --> 01:02:30,840
Very nice.

1585
01:02:31,707 --> 01:02:33,440
This is amazing.

1586
01:02:33,440 --> 01:02:37,140
It's leaning like the Leaning Tower of Pisa.

1587
01:02:38,440 --> 01:02:40,640
It lacks 10% of effort here.

1588
01:02:40,640 --> 01:02:42,273
It should be standing like this.

1589
01:02:43,207 --> 01:02:44,973
It's standing now.

1590
01:02:45,940 --> 01:02:47,440
How do we eat this, by the way?

1591
01:02:47,440 --> 01:02:48,907
Is there a way to eat it?

1592
01:02:49,507 --> 01:02:50,673
Do you have to eat it from the top?

1593
01:02:51,340 --> 01:02:53,440
Should I eat this part first?

1594
01:02:53,940 --> 01:02:56,407
(Is this how you eat it?)

1595
01:02:57,273 --> 01:02:59,740
(They eat it while standing)

1596
01:02:59,740 --> 01:03:01,540
You can eat it from the top like that.

1597
01:03:01,540 --> 01:03:02,707
- It's tasty, isn't it? / - Yes, it is.

1598
01:03:03,273 --> 01:03:04,507
But...

1599
01:03:04,507 --> 01:03:06,373
- It's delicious. / - It's savory.

1600
01:03:06,373 --> 01:03:08,640
- But... / - It tastes so good.

1601
01:03:08,640 --> 01:03:10,973
We shouldn't eat it while standing like this.

1602
01:03:11,507 --> 01:03:13,473
They brought us dishes. We should lay it down.

1603
01:03:13,473 --> 01:03:15,940
- Oh, really? / - Please lie down.

1604
01:03:15,940 --> 01:03:18,240
- That's how you eat it. / - Please lie down.

1605
01:03:19,273 --> 01:03:21,040
- Then you cut it. / - That's how you eat it.

1606
01:03:21,173 --> 01:03:22,173
(She crushes it without hesitation)

1607
01:03:22,173 --> 01:03:23,940
- It looks delicious. / - Is it crispy?

1608
01:03:23,940 --> 01:03:26,140
- Yes, it is. / - It looks really good.

1609
01:03:26,640 --> 01:03:28,940
(Roti tissue is crispy and savory)

1610
01:03:28,940 --> 01:03:30,440
It's the best snack.

1611
01:03:30,773 --> 01:03:32,073
(It's so good)

1612
01:03:32,307 --> 01:03:34,007
It's savory.

1613
01:03:34,373 --> 01:03:37,340
I think they added some salt at the end.

1614
01:03:37,340 --> 01:03:39,940
- It's a little salty. / - She's indeed...

1615
01:03:40,507 --> 01:03:42,173
- A good cook. / - It's not too salty though.

1616
01:03:42,173 --> 01:03:43,673
So it's sweet and savory.

1617
01:03:43,673 --> 01:03:45,673
It's like sweet scorched rice.

1618
01:03:45,673 --> 01:03:46,840
It tastes like scorched rice.

1619
01:03:47,273 --> 01:03:49,040
It seems like they put honey on it.

1620
01:03:49,340 --> 01:03:51,940
This is not honey but condensed milk.

1621
01:03:51,940 --> 01:03:53,407
- Condensed milk. / - Condensed milk.

1622
01:03:53,407 --> 01:03:55,007
- Condensed milk is too good. / - Game over.

1623
01:03:55,007 --> 01:03:56,340
It's almost cheating.

1624
01:03:56,340 --> 01:03:58,407
- When we were young... / - Why would you say that?

1625
01:04:00,173 --> 01:04:01,173
(He throws a wet blanket with his joke)

1626
01:04:01,173 --> 01:04:02,773
I told you not to make such jokes.

1627
01:04:02,773 --> 01:04:06,173
You make old-fashioned jokes...

1628
01:04:06,173 --> 01:04:09,607
- They'll edit it out. / - That's why you're like this.

1629
01:04:09,607 --> 01:04:10,873
They didn't edit it out.

1630
01:04:11,540 --> 01:04:13,673
Hyeonsuk. Now we tried this,

1631
01:04:13,673 --> 01:04:14,740
let's go back to the hotel and go to bed.

1632
01:04:14,740 --> 01:04:16,440
Come on. There's one last place...

1633
01:04:16,440 --> 01:04:18,407
- I wish to go. / - Where?

1634
01:04:18,407 --> 01:04:19,440
We're going to watch

1635
01:04:19,440 --> 01:04:21,373
the beautiful sunset at Tanjung Aru.

1636
01:04:21,373 --> 01:04:23,273
- You must see the sunset. / - You're right.

1637
01:04:23,273 --> 01:04:24,940
It's 1 of the 3 most beautiful sunsets in the world.

1638
01:04:24,940 --> 01:04:26,440
I'd like to see that too.

1639
01:04:26,440 --> 01:04:28,440
Kota Kinabalu is all about the sunset.

1640
01:04:28,440 --> 01:04:30,140
The 3 most beautiful sunset spots in the world are...

1641
01:04:30,373 --> 01:04:32,273
Greece...

1642
01:04:32,273 --> 01:04:33,607
- Santorini. / - I thought it was Fiji.

1643
01:04:33,607 --> 01:04:35,773
- Fiji is one of them. / - I heard the sunset there is nice.

1644
01:04:35,773 --> 01:04:37,607
- We've been to Fiji, right? / - Fiji.

1645
01:04:37,607 --> 01:04:40,507
(Fiji in the South Pacific)

1646
01:04:40,907 --> 01:04:43,107
Kota Kinabalu is famous for its sunset.

1647
01:04:43,107 --> 01:04:45,473
(Kota Kinabalu in Malaysia)

1648
01:04:45,473 --> 01:04:47,840
The famous sunset spot in Kota Kinabalu is

1649
01:04:47,840 --> 01:04:49,140
Tanjung Aru.

1650
01:04:49,140 --> 01:04:50,573
That's the best spot.

1651
01:04:54,407 --> 01:04:56,140
We're going to Tanjung Aru.

1652
01:04:56,807 --> 01:04:57,840
Let's go to Tanjung Aru.

1653
01:04:57,840 --> 01:04:59,773
(15 minutes by taxi from the restaurant to Tanjung Aru)

1654
01:05:01,540 --> 01:05:03,407
It's nice here.

1655
01:05:03,840 --> 01:05:05,473
But it doesn't look different from Korean beaches.

1656
01:05:05,473 --> 01:05:07,140
The sunset there is so beautiful.

1657
01:05:07,140 --> 01:05:08,540
It kind of looks like the Yellow Sea.

1658
01:05:08,540 --> 01:05:10,173
- The mud flat is similar. / - Exactly.

1659
01:05:10,173 --> 01:05:11,840
It's the same sea, isn't it?

1660
01:05:11,840 --> 01:05:12,840
No, no, no, no.

1661
01:05:12,840 --> 01:05:15,607
Where are we? We're at Tanjung Aru.

1662
01:05:15,607 --> 01:05:17,607
- That's going to... / - Soon, it's going to be...

1663
01:05:17,607 --> 01:05:20,373
- Soon it'll look fantastic. / - Exactly.

1664
01:05:20,373 --> 01:05:22,340
It looks amazing, doesn't it?

1665
01:05:22,340 --> 01:05:25,073
After watching the sunset...

1666
01:05:25,073 --> 01:05:27,073
- There will be today's highlight. / - What is it?

1667
01:05:27,073 --> 01:05:28,240
It's what you like.

1668
01:05:28,240 --> 01:05:29,740
(There will be a glass of happiness you like)

1669
01:05:30,607 --> 01:05:32,073
He's smiling.

1670
01:05:32,473 --> 01:05:34,640
- He looks interested. / - Now he smiles.

1671
01:05:35,007 --> 01:05:36,607
Really?

1672
01:05:36,607 --> 01:05:38,373
But you hate it so much.

1673
01:05:38,373 --> 01:05:42,673
I don't like it but it's our 30th anniversary.

1674
01:05:43,073 --> 01:05:44,340
- By the way... / - Look forward to it.

1675
01:05:44,340 --> 01:05:46,840
We're at Tanjung Aru.

1676
01:05:47,140 --> 01:05:49,340
I want to walk on the beach barefoot.

1677
01:05:49,340 --> 01:05:51,107
Shall we walk barefoot together?

1678
01:05:51,107 --> 01:05:53,107
- Let's hold our hands and walk. / - Okay.

1679
01:05:53,207 --> 01:05:55,407
- Let's take off our shoes. / - Alright.

1680
01:05:55,773 --> 01:05:58,640
- Here... / - When we were young...

1681
01:05:59,107 --> 01:06:00,673
Let me...

1682
01:06:00,673 --> 01:06:02,907
(Is he going to do that?)

1683
01:06:04,173 --> 01:06:06,007
(Is he going to write their names on the beach)

1684
01:06:06,007 --> 01:06:08,307
(Like all the couples do?)

1685
01:06:09,840 --> 01:06:11,673
(He's really doing it)

1686
01:06:11,673 --> 01:06:13,907
That was our first time doing it since we got married.

1687
01:06:13,907 --> 01:06:15,840
(He writes their names on the beach)

1688
01:06:18,207 --> 01:06:19,240
(He even draws a heart)

1689
01:06:19,240 --> 01:06:20,507
Oh, yeah.

1690
01:06:21,673 --> 01:06:22,773
If you knew how to do things like this,

1691
01:06:22,773 --> 01:06:26,240
why didn't you do it for the past 30 years?

1692
01:06:26,240 --> 01:06:26,740
(She slaps his back)

1693
01:06:26,740 --> 01:06:28,173
She slaps him even though he's doing it.

1694
01:06:28,173 --> 01:06:30,507
- Men get slapped anyway. / - You're right.

1695
01:06:31,507 --> 01:06:32,707
- It's done. / - It is.

1696
01:06:33,040 --> 01:06:36,540
(They color the beach with their love)

1697
01:06:36,873 --> 01:06:38,673
It's done. Okay.

1698
01:06:38,673 --> 01:06:40,507
- May our love last forever. / - Let's go.

1699
01:06:42,373 --> 01:06:43,440
Let's run.

1700
01:06:43,440 --> 01:06:46,940
(For the first time in 30 years, there's romance)

1701
01:06:48,640 --> 01:06:50,207
Catch me if you can.

1702
01:06:50,307 --> 01:06:51,373
Are you sure?

1703
01:06:51,940 --> 01:06:53,407
You're dead if I catch you.

1704
01:06:53,940 --> 01:06:55,073
You're so dead!

1705
01:06:56,240 --> 01:06:58,673
That used to be a joke back then.

1706
01:06:58,673 --> 01:07:00,240
- That's a joke. / - It's a joke.

1707
01:07:00,873 --> 01:07:02,473
- Come here. / - "You're dead if I catch you."

1708
01:07:03,773 --> 01:07:05,773
- They're fighting. / - They look like kids.

1709
01:07:07,973 --> 01:07:09,040
My goodness.

1710
01:07:09,040 --> 01:07:13,373
It's been a long time since I ran on a beach like this.

1711
01:07:13,573 --> 01:07:14,507
It's not just a long time.

1712
01:07:14,507 --> 01:07:16,473
It's the first time since we got married.

1713
01:07:16,473 --> 01:07:17,673
Is it?

1714
01:07:18,373 --> 01:07:19,707
(The sunset slowly colors the sky)

1715
01:07:19,707 --> 01:07:22,540
- It's so beautiful. / - It is.

1716
01:07:25,107 --> 01:07:30,040
(5 minutes by taxi from Tanjung Aru to Sunset Bar)

1717
01:07:30,473 --> 01:07:31,340
(They came to Sunset Bar for Yangrak)

1718
01:07:31,340 --> 01:07:32,107
It's nice, isn't it?

1719
01:07:35,807 --> 01:07:36,840
Hi.

1720
01:07:37,973 --> 01:07:39,840
It's the kind of vibe you would like.

1721
01:07:39,840 --> 01:07:41,007
- It's nice, isn't it? / - It is.

1722
01:07:41,007 --> 01:07:42,840
- Look at the sunset. / - It looks fantastic.

1723
01:07:42,840 --> 01:07:43,807
(At Sunset Bar, you can watch the pink sunset)

1724
01:07:43,807 --> 01:07:45,240
It looks awesome, doesn't it?

1725
01:07:46,140 --> 01:07:48,873
I've always drunk...

1726
01:07:48,873 --> 01:07:50,640
- Either soju or beer. / - Beer.

1727
01:07:50,640 --> 01:07:52,273
You've never had something like this, have you?

1728
01:07:52,273 --> 01:07:55,573
- I've never tried this. / - It's our anniversary.

1729
01:07:55,573 --> 01:07:57,240
To our 30th anniversary.

1730
01:07:57,740 --> 01:07:58,940
Thank you.

1731
01:07:59,507 --> 01:08:00,707
Enjoy.

1732
01:08:01,273 --> 01:08:02,940
What a beautiful evening.

1733
01:08:03,840 --> 01:08:05,007
It tastes good.

1734
01:08:05,007 --> 01:08:06,407
(How does the cocktail taste to him?)

1735
01:08:07,240 --> 01:08:08,373
(Amazed)

1736
01:08:08,373 --> 01:08:10,973
With a lot of alcohol in it, it can be quite good too.

1737
01:08:10,973 --> 01:08:12,873
- It was delicious. / - Heavy drinkers love cocktails.

1738
01:08:12,873 --> 01:08:18,107
Since you brought me to such a nice place

1739
01:08:18,107 --> 01:08:20,407
and gave me such a delicious drink,

1740
01:08:20,407 --> 01:08:23,207
I want to do something for you too.

1741
01:08:23,207 --> 01:08:26,407
I've prepared something for you.

1742
01:08:26,407 --> 01:08:27,807
Is there a surprise event?

1743
01:08:28,307 --> 01:08:30,907
What were you hiding since a while ago?

1744
01:08:30,907 --> 01:08:33,273
- I brought this from Korea. / - Is this a gift?

1745
01:08:33,273 --> 01:08:35,207
- A 30-year-anniversary gift? / - Yes.

1746
01:08:35,207 --> 01:08:37,673
- What do you think this is? / - Thank you.

1747
01:08:38,240 --> 01:08:40,173
Well...

1748
01:08:40,173 --> 01:08:41,873
- What is that? / - What is that?

1749
01:08:41,873 --> 01:08:43,873
- I think it's a bag. / - A bag?

1750
01:08:43,873 --> 01:08:46,907
Ta-da.

1751
01:08:46,907 --> 01:08:49,473
- What is that? / - What will come out?

1752
01:08:50,007 --> 01:08:51,340
What is that?

1753
01:08:53,307 --> 01:08:54,540
Is that a go board?

1754
01:08:54,907 --> 01:08:56,307
Why did he bring a go board?

1755
01:08:56,307 --> 01:08:57,440
- Are they going to play alkkagi? / - A go board?

1756
01:08:57,440 --> 01:08:59,440
- It's a go board. / - What do you want to do?

1757
01:08:59,440 --> 01:09:02,407
- Me? I want to play... / - Yes.

1758
01:09:02,407 --> 01:09:04,473
Alkkagi while watching the sunset.

1759
01:09:04,507 --> 01:09:06,007
- Alkkagi? / - Yes.

1760
01:09:06,007 --> 01:09:07,373
Alkkagi?

1761
01:09:07,873 --> 01:09:09,940
- Why alkkagi? / - She was expecting a gift.

1762
01:09:09,940 --> 01:09:12,473
- Who else would do it? / - Like a ring.

1763
01:09:12,473 --> 01:09:14,707
- That's my representative work. / - What the?

1764
01:09:16,573 --> 01:09:18,207
Yeah, that's...

1765
01:09:18,207 --> 01:09:20,407
(This corner brought Yangrak's prime again in 2001)

1766
01:09:21,007 --> 01:09:22,907
Do you really want to go there and play alkkagi?

1767
01:09:23,240 --> 01:09:26,807
A go board is convenient because you can just fold it.

1768
01:09:26,807 --> 01:09:27,973
I can't believe this.

1769
01:09:27,973 --> 01:09:31,040
(He really opened the go board)

1770
01:09:31,240 --> 01:09:33,907
I only have to take a few black and white stones.

1771
01:09:35,507 --> 01:09:37,907
- Here. / - He prepared those.

1772
01:09:37,907 --> 01:09:39,907
Can you see this? Alkkagi.

1773
01:09:39,907 --> 01:09:41,107
Isn't this the world's very first?

1774
01:09:41,107 --> 01:09:42,740
Yes, who would play alkkagi there?

1775
01:09:42,740 --> 01:09:45,140
We're going to play alkkagi in Kota Kinabalu,

1776
01:09:45,140 --> 01:09:47,707
where the sunset is famous for being so beautiful.

1777
01:09:47,707 --> 01:09:48,807
Alkkagi.

1778
01:09:48,807 --> 01:09:51,073
(Do you really have to play alkkagi?)

1779
01:09:51,273 --> 01:09:53,140
Alkkagi is eternal.

1780
01:09:53,140 --> 01:09:56,740
Choi Yangrak vs. Paeng Hyeonsuk 2nd dan.

1781
01:09:56,740 --> 01:09:58,540
(Expert vs. Beginner)

1782
01:09:58,540 --> 01:10:00,740
Look how different their expressions are.

1783
01:10:00,740 --> 01:10:02,907
- It's unique. / - Yes.

1784
01:10:03,207 --> 01:10:04,940
(2018 The Master of Alkkagi Match)

1785
01:10:06,240 --> 01:10:07,973
(The Return of Choi Yangrak's Alkkagi)

1786
01:10:07,973 --> 01:10:13,073
Fans who love alkkagi all around the country,

1787
01:10:13,073 --> 01:10:16,807
how are you? I'm Choi Yangrak.

1788
01:10:17,673 --> 01:10:21,140
We're in Kota Kinabalu right now.

1789
01:10:21,140 --> 01:10:23,007
- It's 1 of the 3 best sunsets. / - Yes, it's so beautiful.

1790
01:10:23,007 --> 01:10:25,040
We have the sunset as our background.

1791
01:10:25,040 --> 01:10:27,840
If I lose,

1792
01:10:27,840 --> 01:10:30,207
I will carry my wife, Paeng Hyeonsuk, on my back

1793
01:10:30,207 --> 01:10:32,140
and walk around the bar once.

1794
01:10:32,140 --> 01:10:33,673
If I win,

1795
01:10:33,673 --> 01:10:36,273
she will not nag me

1796
01:10:36,273 --> 01:10:37,940
when I go out drinking.

1797
01:10:38,340 --> 01:10:41,507
Alkkagi is eternal.

1798
01:10:41,807 --> 01:10:42,640
(They start the match)

1799
01:10:42,640 --> 01:10:45,107
You should start first. The first shot.

1800
01:10:45,640 --> 01:10:48,240
How will Paeng Hyeonsuk 2nd dan do?

1801
01:10:48,507 --> 01:10:50,007
(She uses her feet for balance)

1802
01:10:51,607 --> 01:10:52,740
- Oh, my. / - Gosh.

1803
01:10:55,840 --> 01:10:57,607
She took out her own stone.

1804
01:10:57,607 --> 01:10:58,973
(She narrowly missed a white stone)

1805
01:10:59,873 --> 01:11:02,173
Paeng Hyeonsuk made the valuable stone

1806
01:11:02,173 --> 01:11:03,673
fall in the sea.

1807
01:11:03,673 --> 01:11:07,840
Choi Yangrak 9th dan plays against her.

1808
01:11:08,240 --> 01:11:09,507
What will happen?

1809
01:11:10,840 --> 01:11:12,040
(Slam)

1810
01:11:12,473 --> 01:11:13,640
I knew it.

1811
01:11:13,707 --> 01:11:15,540
He took 2 stones with 1 stone.

1812
01:11:15,540 --> 01:11:17,640
- That's impossible. / - He took 2 stones with 1 stone.

1813
01:11:17,640 --> 01:11:19,940
- Isn't it amazing? / - Yes, it is.

1814
01:11:19,940 --> 01:11:22,540
- I took 2 stones with 1 stone. / - He really did.

1815
01:11:24,007 --> 01:11:26,373
It's playing at a slow speed again.

1816
01:11:26,373 --> 01:11:28,307
- I took 2 stones with 1 stone. / - He's amazing.

1817
01:11:28,307 --> 01:11:30,073
- He's the king of alkkagi. / - He's really good.

1818
01:11:30,073 --> 01:11:31,873
He took 2 stones with 1 stone.

1819
01:11:32,440 --> 01:11:34,040
You were too weak.

1820
01:11:34,040 --> 01:11:36,440
How will this turn out?

1821
01:11:40,240 --> 01:11:42,907
- It has backspin. / - It returned.

1822
01:11:42,907 --> 01:11:44,340
You can't avoid this.

1823
01:11:45,340 --> 01:11:46,773
Only 2 stones left.

1824
01:11:47,407 --> 01:11:50,107
Choi Yangrak is still good at this.

1825
01:11:50,107 --> 01:11:52,007
You don't know with alkkagi.

1826
01:11:52,007 --> 01:11:53,273
You have to watch till the end.

1827
01:11:53,273 --> 01:11:54,440
(Her competitive spirit is blazing up)

1828
01:11:55,473 --> 01:11:57,707
- Gosh. / - She hit one out.

1829
01:11:57,707 --> 01:11:59,107
- With alkkagi, you never know. / - Yes.

1830
01:11:59,107 --> 01:12:00,273
He made a mistake.

1831
01:12:00,673 --> 01:12:02,007
He took his own stone out.

1832
01:12:02,407 --> 01:12:06,073
This is your chance.

1833
01:12:07,073 --> 01:12:08,373
- Gosh. / - No.

1834
01:12:09,440 --> 01:12:11,840
She did that on purpose.

1835
01:12:12,107 --> 01:12:14,740
- Too strong. / - This match of alkkagi will end...

1836
01:12:14,740 --> 01:12:17,173
Insipid like this.

1837
01:12:17,173 --> 01:12:21,040
Will it end like this? 1, 2.

1838
01:12:22,040 --> 01:12:23,207
You took your own stone out.

1839
01:12:23,207 --> 01:12:25,973
Oh, no. I got mixed up.

1840
01:12:26,473 --> 01:12:28,407
- What? / - He did it on purpose.

1841
01:12:28,407 --> 01:12:30,140
Yangrak did it on purpose.

1842
01:12:30,140 --> 01:12:31,773
(She succeeds to satisfy his intention)

1843
01:12:31,773 --> 01:12:33,740
- Did she succeed? / - I succeeded.

1844
01:12:34,473 --> 01:12:35,707
That's not easy.

1845
01:12:35,840 --> 01:12:37,173
Oh, my.

1846
01:12:37,173 --> 01:12:39,840
- Wait a minute. / - This is really happening.

1847
01:12:39,840 --> 01:12:40,707
(The final 1 on 1)

1848
01:12:40,707 --> 01:12:42,373
- It really happened. / - I shouldn't hit it too strong.

1849
01:12:42,373 --> 01:12:45,273
- You have to make her nervous now. / - Try it.

1850
01:12:45,673 --> 01:12:49,173
- 1, 2, 3. / - This isn't easy, but she did it.

1851
01:12:49,173 --> 01:12:50,207
(She made a clean last attack)

1852
01:12:50,707 --> 01:12:52,073
She's good.

1853
01:12:52,107 --> 01:12:54,140
(Hyeonsuk wins the Kota Kinabalu alkkagi match)

1854
01:12:54,140 --> 01:12:56,540
I won. I beat you.

1855
01:12:56,540 --> 01:12:59,273
- Don't act up. / - I'm so offended.

1856
01:12:59,273 --> 01:13:00,407
He looks really offended.

1857
01:13:00,407 --> 01:13:01,873
Where are you going?

1858
01:13:01,873 --> 01:13:03,273
You have to carry me on your back.

1859
01:13:03,507 --> 01:13:04,673
Excuse me?

1860
01:13:04,673 --> 01:13:06,773
He must be getting his real gift.

1861
01:13:06,773 --> 01:13:09,507
- The sky is so beautiful. / - Isn't it so beautiful?

1862
01:13:09,507 --> 01:13:11,573
- It's amazing. / - It's so picturesque.

1863
01:13:11,573 --> 01:13:14,307
- The sun is setting. / - It's really beautiful.

1864
01:13:15,007 --> 01:13:17,007
You came at a good time. Carry me on your back.

1865
01:13:17,007 --> 01:13:18,373
Carry me on your back.

1866
01:13:18,373 --> 01:13:21,207
For 30 years, you have done so much for me,

1867
01:13:21,207 --> 01:13:22,940
so I prepared to do alkkagi

1868
01:13:22,940 --> 01:13:25,840
as a preview with this beautiful sunset...

1869
01:13:25,840 --> 01:13:28,507
- The sun has set. / - As a background.

1870
01:13:28,507 --> 01:13:30,973
- I prepared some flowers. / - Oh, my.

1871
01:13:32,307 --> 01:13:33,640
It's so pretty.

1872
01:13:35,207 --> 01:13:37,873
- Don't you like flowers? / - Yes, I like flowers.

1873
01:13:37,873 --> 01:13:40,073
Is this the end? Don't you have anything else

1874
01:13:40,073 --> 01:13:41,573
after the flowers,

1875
01:13:41,573 --> 01:13:43,440
like a ring?

1876
01:13:44,473 --> 01:13:47,140
- A ring. / - What are you talking about?

1877
01:13:47,140 --> 01:13:48,940
People give things like diamond rings.

1878
01:13:50,307 --> 01:13:52,073
- I brought this for you. / - Yes.

1879
01:13:52,440 --> 01:13:53,673
What is that?

1880
01:13:54,407 --> 01:13:56,507
- Did you write a letter? / - Yes.

1881
01:13:57,440 --> 01:13:59,240
- He's a romanticist. / - That's so moving.

1882
01:13:59,240 --> 01:14:01,807
It's a letter for you. Do you want me to read it?

1883
01:14:01,807 --> 01:14:03,073
Yes.

1884
01:14:05,107 --> 01:14:07,773
- Can't you see the letters? / - I'm sorry.

1885
01:14:12,640 --> 01:14:14,407
- "One Day." / - Okay.

1886
01:14:16,273 --> 01:14:20,673
I like the words, "one day."

1887
01:14:21,373 --> 01:14:23,973
- One day, I was born. / - Yes.

1888
01:14:23,973 --> 01:14:26,740
- They were so young. / - One day, I met you.

1889
01:14:27,540 --> 01:14:31,507
Today is also one day.

1890
01:14:33,607 --> 01:14:36,640
Thank you for being by my side for 30 years.

1891
01:14:37,573 --> 01:14:39,340
Also, please be my side from now on.

1892
01:14:39,573 --> 01:14:42,640
Suhui, I love you. From Yangrak.

1893
01:14:44,040 --> 01:14:45,273
It's so moving.

1894
01:14:48,940 --> 01:14:52,840
It's a poem by Kim Yongtaek named, "One Day."

1895
01:14:52,840 --> 01:14:54,007
Isn't it so amazing?

1896
01:14:54,007 --> 01:14:56,940
- You added a poem to your letter. / - Yes.

1897
01:14:56,940 --> 01:14:59,307
- I prepared this for you. / - Thank you.

1898
01:14:59,307 --> 01:15:02,107
What else do you have next?

1899
01:15:02,107 --> 01:15:03,707
What? Isn't it over?

1900
01:15:03,707 --> 01:15:05,273
I'll have to carry you on my back now.

1901
01:15:05,273 --> 01:15:06,907
- Is this the end? / - Yes.

1902
01:15:06,907 --> 01:15:09,840
- Let's do it like this. / - It's a little disappointing.

1903
01:15:10,573 --> 01:15:12,173
(Stop talking and get on my back)

1904
01:15:12,673 --> 01:15:16,007
I thought there would be some more.

1905
01:15:16,973 --> 01:15:18,240
She thought there was more.

1906
01:15:18,240 --> 01:15:20,007
- You need to take the flowers. / - Yes.

1907
01:15:21,073 --> 01:15:22,440
I'm the champion.

1908
01:15:27,340 --> 01:15:28,473
There are so many people here.

1909
01:15:28,473 --> 01:15:29,740
I was so thankful.

1910
01:15:29,740 --> 01:15:32,940
I didn't think a day like this would happen.

1911
01:15:32,940 --> 01:15:36,673
On this trip, we had a lot of time to look at each other.

1912
01:15:36,673 --> 01:15:40,873
I changed a lot but Yangrak also changed a lot.

1913
01:15:40,873 --> 01:15:42,640
For that, I want to be good to him.

1914
01:15:44,007 --> 01:15:46,840
This trip was really meaningful.

1915
01:15:46,840 --> 01:15:48,540
If we have the time,

1916
01:15:48,540 --> 01:15:51,307
I'd like to come for our 31st anniversary.

1917
01:15:51,307 --> 01:15:52,540
The 30th anniversary isn't

1918
01:15:52,540 --> 01:15:55,473
the only meaningful anniversary.

1919
01:15:55,473 --> 01:15:57,873
We could come again for our 31st anniversary.

1920
01:15:58,573 --> 01:16:00,307
Oh, my goodness.

1921
01:16:03,073 --> 01:16:06,007
(My legs hurt)

1922
01:16:07,507 --> 01:16:09,440
Do it again. Do it again.

1923
01:16:09,973 --> 01:16:11,107
Do it again.

1924
01:16:12,473 --> 01:16:13,440
(30th anniversary, big event, success)

1925
01:16:13,440 --> 01:16:15,207
Event. Big event.

1926
01:16:15,640 --> 01:16:16,740
I'm a little exhausted.

1927
01:16:16,740 --> 01:16:18,707
- You became a little... / - This is so beautiful.

1928
01:16:18,707 --> 01:16:20,707
Heavier than we got married which is reassuring.

1929
01:16:20,707 --> 01:16:22,340
- Are you reassured? / - Yes.

1930
01:16:24,240 --> 01:16:28,607
- It was like a sitcom drama. / - Yes.

1931
01:16:28,607 --> 01:16:31,273
He complained but he did everything for you.

1932
01:16:31,273 --> 01:16:33,807
You only have to drink less.

1933
01:16:34,073 --> 01:16:35,707
How frequently do you drink?

1934
01:16:35,707 --> 01:16:37,240
He drinks every day.

1935
01:16:37,240 --> 01:16:38,373
- Every day? / - He drinks every day.

1936
01:16:38,373 --> 01:16:40,540
- That's why I... / - Sikyung drinks more.

1937
01:16:40,707 --> 01:16:43,673
- Why are you talking about me? / - He's exposing you.

1938
01:16:43,673 --> 01:16:44,773
Sikyung is famous for it.

1939
01:16:44,773 --> 01:16:47,340
- He's famous for it. / - That's right.

1940
01:16:48,107 --> 01:16:51,507
Wasn't it hard to go to the island on your tour?

1941
01:16:51,507 --> 01:16:54,507
- It's not hard. / - You can just ride the boat.

1942
01:16:54,507 --> 01:16:55,407
You can go easily.

1943
01:16:55,407 --> 01:16:58,540
If you go to Jesselton Point,

1944
01:16:58,540 --> 01:17:01,940
there are a lot of travel agencies.

1945
01:17:01,940 --> 01:17:03,640
You can compare the prices

1946
01:17:03,640 --> 01:17:05,273
and choose the one you like.

1947
01:17:05,273 --> 01:17:07,573
I want to tell you

1948
01:17:07,573 --> 01:17:10,273
to make a reservation beforehand.

1949
01:17:10,273 --> 01:17:12,807
- If you think, oh, whatever... / - You can't do that.

1950
01:17:12,807 --> 01:17:14,640
You will get ripped off.

1951
01:17:14,640 --> 01:17:15,973
If you make a reservation beforehand,

1952
01:17:15,973 --> 01:17:18,273
you can fix a price.

1953
01:17:18,273 --> 01:17:20,473
Then you can make a very cheap, meaningful

1954
01:17:20,473 --> 01:17:22,407
and happy trip that way.

1955
01:17:22,407 --> 01:17:24,873
I think it was a good trip.

1956
01:17:24,873 --> 01:17:26,773
I think it's a good place for the parents.

1957
01:17:26,773 --> 01:17:27,773
- That's right. / - That's right.

1958
01:17:27,773 --> 01:17:29,340
I think it would be a nice place

1959
01:17:29,340 --> 01:17:30,507
to go for an anniversary...

1960
01:17:30,507 --> 01:17:33,440
- For married couples. / - When you took...

1961
01:17:33,440 --> 01:17:35,340
- The wedding photos again... / - Yes.

1962
01:17:35,340 --> 01:17:37,007
It was moving to see you take photos

1963
01:17:37,007 --> 01:17:38,807
just like you did in the past.

1964
01:17:38,807 --> 01:17:40,273
- Yes. / - That was moving.

1965
01:17:40,273 --> 01:17:42,973
I wanted to send my parents there after seeing that.

1966
01:17:42,973 --> 01:17:44,640
- That's right. / - Yes.

1967
01:17:44,640 --> 01:17:47,407
I'm confident that we will win this time.

1968
01:17:47,807 --> 01:17:50,340
- I think we will win. / - Why are you talking about that?

1969
01:17:50,340 --> 01:17:52,540
- What is he on about? / - I'm worried about the cost.

1970
01:17:52,540 --> 01:17:54,007
He's talking to himself.

1971
01:17:54,007 --> 01:17:56,340
- It didn't cost a lot. / - I talk to myself every week.

1972
01:17:56,907 --> 01:17:58,640
I'm a little worried about the travel expense.

1973
01:17:58,640 --> 01:18:00,073
What is the total expense of

1974
01:18:00,073 --> 01:18:02,540
the Balu Tour excluding airfare?

1975
01:18:02,540 --> 01:18:04,673
- Per person. / - Per person.

1976
01:18:06,340 --> 01:18:08,273
It was $456.

1977
01:18:08,273 --> 01:18:10,307
($456 per person)

1978
01:18:10,307 --> 01:18:13,940
$456 could be thought of as a lot.

1979
01:18:13,940 --> 01:18:15,540
It was our 30th anniversary.

1980
01:18:15,540 --> 01:18:16,873
- They even got a massage. / - We did things...

1981
01:18:16,873 --> 01:18:19,440
Thinking we would never be able to do it again.

1982
01:18:19,440 --> 01:18:21,373
- We can't go there every day. / - Of course.

1983
01:18:21,373 --> 01:18:24,207
- It's worth it. / - The total expense is...

1984
01:18:24,207 --> 01:18:25,673
- Of course. / - Quite cheap.

1985
01:18:25,673 --> 01:18:27,540
I think you spent more money than I expected.

1986
01:18:27,540 --> 01:18:31,007
Just play at the neighborhood stream then.

1987
01:18:31,507 --> 01:18:33,507
Catch some minnows and play there.

1988
01:18:33,840 --> 01:18:37,173
- That's right. / - It's a good place for the parents.

1989
01:18:37,173 --> 01:18:38,973
- That's important. / - That's right.

1990
01:18:38,973 --> 01:18:41,207
Would you go to Kota Kinabalu

1991
01:18:41,207 --> 01:18:43,907
according to Balu Tour's plan?

1992
01:18:43,907 --> 01:18:45,707
Please vote.

1993
01:18:46,607 --> 01:18:48,940
(They planned a trip for married couples)

1994
01:18:48,940 --> 01:18:52,673
(What will the judges choose?)

1995
01:18:54,073 --> 01:18:57,273
Next week, we will reveal the Hokkaido travelogue

1996
01:18:57,273 --> 01:19:00,240
of the married couple, Kim Yuna and Kim Hyungkyu,

1997
01:19:00,240 --> 01:19:01,573
who are like friends and like lovers.

1998
01:19:01,573 --> 01:19:03,073
Please look forward to the next episode!

1999
01:19:03,073 --> 01:19:04,673
- Thank you. / - Thank you.

2000
01:19:08,273 --> 01:19:09,607
(Next Episode)

2001
01:19:10,307 --> 01:19:12,373
Sapporo television tower.

2002
01:19:12,373 --> 01:19:14,073
(Part 2 of trips for married couples)

2003
01:19:17,007 --> 01:19:18,273
So cute.

2004
01:19:18,273 --> 01:19:20,507
It's wagging its tail.

2005
01:19:20,507 --> 01:19:22,107
Come.

2006
01:19:22,107 --> 01:19:24,773
Since we had a walk, we're hungry now.

2007
01:19:24,773 --> 01:19:26,607
(Juicy corn, the sacred place for various foods)

2008
01:19:26,607 --> 01:19:28,173
This can't be corn.

2009
01:19:28,173 --> 01:19:29,940
It pops in your mouth.

2010
01:19:30,540 --> 01:19:32,907
- It's so delicious. / - Really?

2011
01:19:35,407 --> 01:19:37,273
It's so unrealistic.

2012
01:19:37,273 --> 01:19:38,940
You can't capture this in the photo.

2013
01:19:38,940 --> 01:19:39,907
I want to save this in my eyes.

2014
01:19:39,907 --> 01:19:43,373
(Battle Trip)

2015
01:19:43,373 --> 01:19:59,940
