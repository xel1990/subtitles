1
00:00:00,773 --> 00:00:03,540
(Numerous great tips on trips)

2
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:07,373
(Kim Sook, Sung Sikyung)

3
00:00:08,473 --> 00:00:09,973
(Special host, Kim Iljung)

4
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:12,273
Travel is war.

5
00:00:12,273 --> 00:00:14,740
Battle Trip!

6
00:00:16,607 --> 00:00:19,873
This week's special host for Battle Trip is

7
00:00:19,873 --> 00:00:21,607
Kim Iljung. Welcome.

8
00:00:21,607 --> 00:00:24,007
- Hello, I'm Kim Iljung. / - Welcome.

9
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:26,207
It's such an honor.

10
00:00:26,207 --> 00:00:28,907
- I came here as a trip designer. / - That's right.

11
00:00:28,907 --> 00:00:31,273
It was a big issue then because of your team name.

12
00:00:31,273 --> 00:00:33,073
It was the Back to Sing Tour, right?

13
00:00:33,073 --> 00:00:35,007
The related search keyword for me was "divorce."

14
00:00:35,007 --> 00:00:35,807
I remember.

15
00:00:35,807 --> 00:00:37,007
Battle Trip has to take responsibility for that.

16
00:00:37,007 --> 00:00:38,340
Why is that our fault?

17
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:40,173
Why was it called Back to Sing Tour?

18
00:00:40,173 --> 00:00:41,407
Because it wasn't our first time to Singapore.

19
00:00:41,407 --> 00:00:43,507
We've been to Singapore before.

20
00:00:43,507 --> 00:00:45,873
Back to Sing Tour means to go back to Singapore.

21
00:00:45,873 --> 00:00:48,307
- You have to name the tour carefully. / - Right.

22
00:00:48,307 --> 00:00:49,440
- I never got a divorce. / - Yes.

23
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:50,640
Actually...

24
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:51,840
- Did you win or lose? / - My team won.

25
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,307
- He won. / - Did he win?

26
00:00:53,307 --> 00:00:55,973
We need to keep the streak alive and win again.

27
00:00:55,973 --> 00:00:56,673
Of course, we have to win.

28
00:00:56,673 --> 00:00:59,840
Anyway, we'll start Battle Trip right now.

29
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:01,407
First, let's see the theme of this trip

30
00:01:01,407 --> 00:01:02,373
on the screen first.

31
00:01:02,673 --> 00:01:03,607
(Summer vacation for office workers)

32
00:01:03,607 --> 00:01:04,873
(Leave)

33
00:01:04,873 --> 00:01:06,273
(You don't need an annual leave or vacation)

34
00:01:06,273 --> 00:01:07,240
You don't need an annual leave...

35
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:08,673
- You also don't need a vacation. / - Nor vacation.

36
00:01:08,673 --> 00:01:10,840
(Enjoy the weekend!)

37
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:14,873
(Short flight time, cheap travel expenses)

38
00:01:14,873 --> 00:01:16,207
Short flight time

39
00:01:16,207 --> 00:01:17,607
and cheap travel expenses.

40
00:01:17,607 --> 00:01:19,240
- It's for the weekend. / - That's right.

41
00:01:25,507 --> 00:01:27,807
We really went to a lot of places.

42
00:01:27,807 --> 00:01:29,873
The color of the water is different for each country.

43
00:01:31,707 --> 00:01:33,673
(A relaxing late vacation)

44
00:01:33,973 --> 00:01:35,073
(Burdenless last-minute summer vacation)

45
00:01:35,073 --> 00:01:36,440
A last-minute summer vacation.

46
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:38,340
The theme is last-minute summer vacations?

47
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:40,773
We have to focus on what comes

48
00:01:40,773 --> 00:01:41,640
in front of summer vacation.

49
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:43,673
- It is "burdenless." / - A burdenless vacation.

50
00:01:43,673 --> 00:01:45,773
- I really love that word. / - Yes, that's important.

51
00:01:45,773 --> 00:01:50,140
Actually, for office workers, taking 1 or 2 days off...

52
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:51,907
- Makes you uncomfortable. / - That's right.

53
00:01:51,907 --> 00:01:53,240
People want to save up their leaves and

54
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:54,740
use them at once.

55
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:56,840
- That's their hope. / - Right.

56
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:58,740
- But they won't have to take a day off. / - Okay.

57
00:01:58,740 --> 00:01:59,973
They can leave on Friday night

58
00:01:59,973 --> 00:02:01,940
and go to work on Monday with this trip.

59
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:03,773
- That's awesome. / - That's the best part.

60
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:06,740
If you're watching our show and

61
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:08,807
you were too busy to go on a vacation this year...

62
00:02:08,807 --> 00:02:11,607
And if you feel like you want to take off somewhere,

63
00:02:11,607 --> 00:02:12,940
the trips we will show you today...

64
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:15,140
- Don't require you to take any days off. / - Right.

65
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:15,873
Anyway,

66
00:02:15,873 --> 00:02:19,307
our guests went to places where they can enjoy

67
00:02:19,307 --> 00:02:20,107
without feeling burdened.

68
00:02:20,107 --> 00:02:22,407
Everyone, let us introduce the four trip planners.

69
00:02:22,407 --> 00:02:23,873
- Come on out. / - Come on out.

70
00:02:25,173 --> 00:02:28,907
(Who are the trip planners?)

71
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:30,907
(Oh Nami, Lee Sookyung)

72
00:02:32,273 --> 00:02:33,807
We won. We won.

73
00:02:33,807 --> 00:02:35,840
- We won this one. / - What do you mean?

74
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,940
- We won this battle. / - They will be hard to beat.

75
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:39,507
I know a bit about Raeyeon.

76
00:02:39,507 --> 00:02:41,307
She's an expert traveler.

77
00:02:41,307 --> 00:02:42,673
- Is that so? / - Yes, she is indeed.

78
00:02:42,673 --> 00:02:45,740
Unless I'm working, I like traveling around the world.

79
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:48,240
And a lot of my relatives live abroad.

80
00:02:48,873 --> 00:02:50,440
- A lot of my relatives. / - Very global.

81
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:53,540
- I'm so jealous. / - All of my family lives in Korea.

82
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:57,140
First off, let's find out where each team went to.

83
00:02:57,140 --> 00:03:01,340
We went to the best vacation spot in the Philippines.

84
00:03:01,773 --> 00:03:03,507
It's the ultimate vacation spot.

85
00:03:03,507 --> 00:03:06,973
No one on this island is in a rush. We went to...

86
00:03:06,973 --> 00:03:09,140
Cebu!

87
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:10,473
- Cebu! / - That's a great destination.

88
00:03:10,473 --> 00:03:12,007
- Cebu is the best. / - Battle Trip went there a lot.

89
00:03:12,007 --> 00:03:13,440
- Exactly. / - Right.

90
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:16,007
Actually, I've been to Cebu a few times myself.

91
00:03:16,007 --> 00:03:17,707
I remember having so much fun in Cebu.

92
00:03:17,707 --> 00:03:19,440
- You can have so much fun there. / - Right.

93
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:22,807
It's a short flight which usually leaves at night.

94
00:03:22,807 --> 00:03:24,340
- So you can sleep on the flight. / - How long is it?

95
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:26,640
- 4 hours and 30 minutes. / - Is it a direct flight?

96
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,073
- Yes, there's a flight every day. / - Every day?

97
00:03:29,073 --> 00:03:31,440
Once you see the beach, you'd...

98
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,707
- Feel you're on vacation. / - The beach is a must...

99
00:03:33,707 --> 00:03:35,573
- For your summer vacation. / - Cebu is the answer.

100
00:03:35,573 --> 00:03:36,473
It's a perfect summer destination.

101
00:03:36,473 --> 00:03:39,007
We did every activity

102
00:03:39,007 --> 00:03:40,673
we could do in the ocean in Cebu.

103
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,107
- It was the best. / - What did you do in the water?

104
00:03:43,107 --> 00:03:46,007
- You'll find out later. Not now. / - I almost spoiled it.

105
00:03:46,007 --> 00:03:47,507
- I almost spoiled it. / - That would've been bad.

106
00:03:47,507 --> 00:03:50,440
- We had so much fun. / - We'll share our destination.

107
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:54,673
We went to the best gourmet city in Asia.

108
00:03:54,673 --> 00:03:58,373
This place is the center of Chinese cuisine.

109
00:03:58,373 --> 00:04:02,173
- We went to Chengdu in Sichuan. / - Hold on.

110
00:04:03,573 --> 00:04:04,773
Her pronunciation is so good.

111
00:04:04,773 --> 00:04:06,307
- Where? / - She sounded so cool.

112
00:04:06,307 --> 00:04:07,373
- Where did you go again? / - Pardon?

113
00:04:07,373 --> 00:04:09,840
We went to Chengdu in Sichuan.

114
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,507
- Chengdu? / - Chengdu?

115
00:04:11,507 --> 00:04:14,140
Sichuan is known for clean water.

116
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:15,973
Places with clean water are known

117
00:04:15,973 --> 00:04:17,573
for alcohol and beautiful women.

118
00:04:17,573 --> 00:04:18,707
That's why you know so much about the place.

119
00:04:18,707 --> 00:04:21,940
- I have friends in China... / - That's why he knows.

120
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:24,007
- I really wanted to go there. / - Just go to Jeju-do.

121
00:04:24,007 --> 00:04:25,873
It's famous for spicy food...

122
00:04:25,873 --> 00:04:27,540
Gosh, I'm salivating.

123
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:29,740
- Sikyung, that's not the point. / - Yes?

124
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:31,740
Their merit is something else.

125
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:33,407
- Raeyeon is Chinese. / - You should tell us.

126
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:34,873
She's from China.

127
00:04:34,873 --> 00:04:37,140
- Chinese is her native tongue. / - That's it. This is it.

128
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:39,240
- We won now. / - Are you two from Cebu?

129
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,440
No.

130
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:42,707
I'm not from Sichuan.

131
00:04:42,707 --> 00:04:45,207
By the way, Raeyeon is the expert on China.

132
00:04:45,207 --> 00:04:47,440
You've been to every part of China, right?

133
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:50,140
Over two trips to China,

134
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:52,107
I went around China for about 100 days.

135
00:04:52,107 --> 00:04:54,140
- I've been to most of China. / - 100 days?

136
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:56,307
It's not easy to visit most of China.

137
00:04:56,307 --> 00:04:58,140
- That's 3 months. / - I've been to most of the places.

138
00:04:58,140 --> 00:05:02,607
Among those places, Sichuan cuisine is the best.

139
00:05:02,607 --> 00:05:04,207
We both like food.

140
00:05:04,207 --> 00:05:06,507
- That's right. / - We can handle spicy food well.

141
00:05:06,507 --> 00:05:08,840
The beach in Cebu is great

142
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:11,307
but instead of going to a predictable place...

143
00:05:12,373 --> 00:05:14,773
- No, no. It's not predictable. / - Predictable?

144
00:05:14,773 --> 00:05:16,173
- It's a unique destination. / - What do you mean?

145
00:05:16,173 --> 00:05:17,540
It hasn't been introduced yet.

146
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:20,907
- That's right. / - We chose Sichuan so we can...

147
00:05:20,907 --> 00:05:23,740
Introduce you special parts of the place thoroughly.

148
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:25,073
When I go there,

149
00:05:25,073 --> 00:05:26,540
I can't order food because I don't speak the language.

150
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:28,540
- They speak Korean in Cebu. / - It was so convenient.

151
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:31,840
- The menus are in Korean. / - They have Korean menus.

152
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:34,773
On top of that, Filipinos in Cebu speak great Korean.

153
00:05:34,773 --> 00:05:35,640
Of course.

154
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:37,873
Among the dishes you had,

155
00:05:37,873 --> 00:05:39,473
I heard you had a unique dish.

156
00:05:39,473 --> 00:05:40,707
Tell us without spoilers.

157
00:05:40,707 --> 00:05:42,007
- That dish. / - What is it?

158
00:05:42,007 --> 00:05:44,173
We ate a nose there.

159
00:05:44,173 --> 00:05:45,940
- A nose? / - Yes.

160
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:48,240
- You ate a nose? / - You're not supposed to eat noses.

161
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,707
- Alright. We'll do one better. / - One better?

162
00:05:50,707 --> 00:05:51,840
We ate...

163
00:05:52,607 --> 00:05:53,607
A jaw.

164
00:05:53,607 --> 00:05:54,807
- Jaw? / - Yes.

165
00:05:54,807 --> 00:05:56,407
- You ate a chin? / - Yes.

166
00:05:56,407 --> 00:05:58,373
- You ate a jaw? / - It was the best jaw we had.

167
00:05:58,373 --> 00:06:00,473
- Really? / - What is she talking about now?

168
00:06:00,473 --> 00:06:02,640
It's a battle between a nose and a jaw.

169
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:04,240
- What else did you see there? / - Chengdu...

170
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,673
- Is the hometown of pandas. / - Really?

171
00:06:06,673 --> 00:06:09,673
- The whole world loves pandas. / - Pandas.

172
00:06:09,673 --> 00:06:11,740
- Did you see pandas? / - A baby panda.

173
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:14,340
- It was so tiny. It wriggled. / - A baby panda?

174
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:16,740
- The panda was flailing. / - It couldn't even roll over.

175
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:18,873
- That's so cute. / - The panda couldn't even roll over.

176
00:06:18,873 --> 00:06:21,173
- They saw pandas. / - Let's beat that.

177
00:06:21,173 --> 00:06:23,440
- We'll top that. We saw... / - Sure, pandas are cute.

178
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,807
A whale shark.

179
00:06:25,807 --> 00:06:27,907
- You'll love it. / - You're going to love it.

180
00:06:27,907 --> 00:06:30,340
You can also swim with a whale shark.

181
00:06:30,873 --> 00:06:32,173
- It's a whale shark. / - With the whale shark?

182
00:06:32,173 --> 00:06:33,940
- You can swim? / - You can swim together.

183
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:35,907
- It'd beat pandas. / - Alright.

184
00:06:35,907 --> 00:06:39,207
It's panda vs. whale shark. Nose dish vs. jaw dish.

185
00:06:39,207 --> 00:06:41,173
This will be a very weird episode.

186
00:06:41,173 --> 00:06:43,240
We have our 100 impartial judges

187
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:44,440
who will vote on today's trips.

188
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:46,173
- Welcome. / - Welcome.

189
00:06:46,173 --> 00:06:48,407
(100 judges in the audience)

190
00:06:49,673 --> 00:06:51,640
- Let's go to Cebu first. / - Cebu.

191
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:53,507
- Let's start with Cebu. / - The Philippines...

192
00:06:53,507 --> 00:06:55,240
- Consists of islands. / - That's right.

193
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:58,173
- There are thousands of islands. / - Lots of islands.

194
00:06:58,173 --> 00:06:59,340
Among those islands,

195
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:01,440
Cebu is the second largest island.

196
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,973
- So there are many places to visit. / - That's right.

197
00:07:03,973 --> 00:07:07,073
That's why we went to the south.

198
00:07:07,073 --> 00:07:09,140
- To the south? / - That's a bit unfamiliar.

199
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:10,940
- South is a bit unfamiliar. / - You haven't been, right?

200
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:12,307
- Oslob? / - I've never heard of that.

201
00:07:12,307 --> 00:07:14,940
- Isn't that in Europe? / - Are you going to Oslob...

202
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:16,273
To see the whale sharks?

203
00:07:16,273 --> 00:07:17,473
- That's right. / - Can you see it there?

204
00:07:17,473 --> 00:07:20,907
- It's the hottest thing right now. / - I see.

205
00:07:20,907 --> 00:07:23,073
- Seeing whale sharks in Oslob. / - We saw them once.

206
00:07:23,073 --> 00:07:26,573
It was in Cancun, Mexico. It was so fascinating.

207
00:07:26,573 --> 00:07:28,707
- It was so up close. / - But a huge whale shark...

208
00:07:28,707 --> 00:07:31,140
- Was passing by. / - But Cancun is too far away.

209
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:33,073
- Right. It's too far. / - Yes, indeed.

210
00:07:33,073 --> 00:07:35,473
Basically, you can do everything you could do

211
00:07:35,473 --> 00:07:36,373
in Cancun over in Oslob, right?

212
00:07:36,373 --> 00:07:38,440
- That's right. / - Alright.

213
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:40,107
- I'm curious. / - Let's set out now.

214
00:07:40,107 --> 00:07:43,307
Let's check out 52 Tour's trip to Cebu, Philippines.

215
00:07:43,307 --> 00:07:44,307
(The trip to Cebu starts)

216
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:48,573
- Hello. / - Hi.

217
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,240
This feels awkward.

218
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,440
(Feeling awkward)

219
00:07:52,073 --> 00:07:54,140
Hello, I'm Lee Sookyung.

220
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:56,140
Hello, I'm Oh Nami.

221
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:04,640
(Sookyung and Nami are close friends)

222
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:06,740
- How pretty. / - They look cute.

223
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:10,307
I'm so happy that I made a new friend late in life.

224
00:08:10,307 --> 00:08:12,740
We can become much closer after this trip together.

225
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:15,807
We haven't been friends for that long.

226
00:08:15,807 --> 00:08:18,507
So I thought it'd be good to go on a trip together

227
00:08:18,507 --> 00:08:20,873
and find out more about each other.

228
00:08:20,873 --> 00:08:23,273
- That's why I chose her. / - That's why I'm so excited.

229
00:08:23,273 --> 00:08:25,540
- That I get to travel with you. / - As for me...

230
00:08:26,107 --> 00:08:28,340
- Don't travel much. / - That's right.

231
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:31,207
She likes staying home and playing with her dog.

232
00:08:31,207 --> 00:08:32,673
I love staying at home.

233
00:08:33,073 --> 00:08:36,173
Whenever I have time to spare, I go traveling.

234
00:08:36,173 --> 00:08:37,207
(Nami travels whenever she can)

235
00:08:39,207 --> 00:08:40,840
(Nami went to Yeosu with Daeseong and Soyeong)

236
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:43,373
Come to Yeosu.

237
00:08:43,373 --> 00:08:45,440
- You went to Yeosu. / - Right.

238
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:48,140
- Did you win back then? / - Yes, we did.

239
00:08:49,307 --> 00:08:50,473
I made an observation.

240
00:08:50,473 --> 00:08:52,840
We should eat a lot of good food.

241
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:55,707
The viewers like to see us having fun.

242
00:08:55,707 --> 00:08:59,307
I love it. Whatever you decide, I'll like it.

243
00:08:59,307 --> 00:09:02,240
- I can trust you and follow you. / - Really?

244
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:05,207
Most importantly, I'll make sure you have fun.

245
00:09:05,207 --> 00:09:06,773
I'll plan our trip according to that.

246
00:09:06,773 --> 00:09:08,740
Did you decide on a country?

247
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:11,973
This time, Battle Trip is doing

248
00:09:11,973 --> 00:09:16,007
a last-minute summer vacation special.

249
00:09:16,007 --> 00:09:17,907
When you think of summer vacation,

250
00:09:17,907 --> 00:09:19,307
you'd think of the beach.

251
00:09:19,307 --> 00:09:21,073
- I love it. / - Right?

252
00:09:21,073 --> 00:09:24,407
I thought about where we could go

253
00:09:24,407 --> 00:09:27,707
to the beach overseas not far from Korea.

254
00:09:28,573 --> 00:09:31,373
The closest beach we can go to is the one in Cebu.

255
00:09:32,207 --> 00:09:33,507
And what's important is that

256
00:09:33,507 --> 00:09:35,807
Battle Trip has never introduced Cebu before.

257
00:09:35,807 --> 00:09:38,607
- Really? / - We introduced the Philippines a lot.

258
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,607
- That's so cute. / - What is that?

259
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:43,140
- That's so adorable. / - What is that?

260
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:48,840
(The beach in Cebu is loved by Korean tourists)

261
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:51,340
- They're so adorable. / - Is that the whale shark?

262
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:52,540
- What is that? / - Wow.

263
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:53,840
Isn't that so cute?

264
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:57,040
- We won! / - You were right next to it.

265
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,540
- I just got goose bumps. / - Aren't they so cute?

266
00:09:58,540 --> 00:09:59,473
We've won!

267
00:10:00,473 --> 00:10:02,673
- It's like a painting. / - It's so amazing.

268
00:10:02,673 --> 00:10:04,707
I've seen this on TV.

269
00:10:06,673 --> 00:10:08,373
(Cebu is all about the beaches?)

270
00:10:09,573 --> 00:10:14,040
(The ultimate guide to conquering Cebu)

271
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:16,240
- That'll be hard to beat. / - It's not predictable.

272
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,207
- Exactly. / - Didn't I tell you?

273
00:10:18,207 --> 00:10:21,207
We enjoyed both nature and the city in Cebu.

274
00:10:21,207 --> 00:10:22,540
- What's that? / - What is it?

275
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:24,007
- What is that? / - Isn't that Las Vegas?

276
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:28,273
(A parade of various dishes no one imagined)

277
00:10:28,273 --> 00:10:30,073
- They have all kinds of food. / - I love that dish.

278
00:10:30,973 --> 00:10:32,340
Goodness.

279
00:10:32,507 --> 00:10:34,540
(Food paradise)

280
00:10:35,773 --> 00:10:43,107
(A trip to Cebu you've never seen before)

281
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:45,807
Follow me.

282
00:10:45,807 --> 00:10:47,273
Just trust me and follow.

283
00:10:47,273 --> 00:10:50,140
You can see all of downtown Cebu at a glance.

284
00:10:50,673 --> 00:10:52,340
What is that?

285
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:53,773
It's so...

286
00:10:53,773 --> 00:10:55,473
I brought Sookyung.

287
00:10:57,273 --> 00:10:59,040
- You're doing well, Nami. / - She's funny.

288
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:01,240
What on earth is this?

289
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:03,373
(She can scream like the dolphin)

290
00:11:03,973 --> 00:11:05,573
It's here. It's here!

291
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:10,340
(Big reactions whenever she's happy or scared)

292
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:11,440
I want that one.

293
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,473
Yes.

294
00:11:13,107 --> 00:11:15,073
She has great reaction.

295
00:11:15,073 --> 00:11:18,173
- Their trip already looks fun. / - I can feel the energy.

296
00:11:18,173 --> 00:11:19,573
Goodness.

297
00:11:19,573 --> 00:11:21,707
- I want to go there. / - Now...

298
00:11:21,707 --> 00:11:25,340
52 Tour!

299
00:11:26,173 --> 00:11:27,840
(52 Tour's 52-hour trip)

300
00:11:28,107 --> 00:11:30,207
(Conquering the nature in Oslob, Cebu)

301
00:11:30,207 --> 00:11:32,773
(Local breakfast, whale shark, Tumalog Falls, dinner)

302
00:11:32,773 --> 00:11:35,273
(Conquering the city, Cebu)

303
00:11:35,273 --> 00:11:37,773
(Tropical fruit, seafood, observatory, trendy place)

304
00:11:38,607 --> 00:11:40,240
I'm already worried from the start.

305
00:11:42,273 --> 00:11:43,307
Nami...

306
00:11:43,307 --> 00:11:45,073
(Why is Sookyung coming alone?)

307
00:11:45,073 --> 00:11:47,107
We're supposed to meet there.

308
00:11:47,107 --> 00:11:49,207
Our 52 Tour has begun now.

309
00:11:49,773 --> 00:11:54,840
(She video calls Nami who will set out from Busan)

310
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:57,040
- Nami. / - We left for the trip separately.

311
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:58,807
- Why did she leave from Busan? / - Separately.

312
00:11:58,807 --> 00:12:00,107
- Was it because of her schedule? / - Yes.

313
00:12:00,107 --> 00:12:02,073
- She left from Busan. / - The Comedy Festival?

314
00:12:02,073 --> 00:12:02,840
Yes.

315
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:05,673
You know the name of our tour...

316
00:12:05,673 --> 00:12:07,307
- Can be pronounced as Oh Lee Tour. / - Right.

317
00:12:07,307 --> 00:12:12,940
We will be on our trip for 52 hours as well.

318
00:12:13,573 --> 00:12:15,240
You're smart as expected.

319
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:18,207
- Okay. Get there safely. / - Okay.

320
00:12:18,907 --> 00:12:19,707
Let's go!

321
00:12:19,707 --> 00:12:22,773
(They're meeting at Cebu International Airport)

322
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:24,840
Go, go, go!

323
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:30,573
I'm finally done with work. I'm going on vacation.

324
00:12:31,073 --> 00:12:32,940
I look like a real office worker.

325
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:36,273
Right after I finish work, I'm setting out for my trip.

326
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:37,940
What's wrong with my face?

327
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:40,340
- Why? You look pretty. / - You think so?

328
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:40,707
Yes.

329
00:12:40,707 --> 00:12:42,140
- I'm so nervous alone. / - My goodness.

330
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:44,007
- That big camera. / - It's embarrassing.

331
00:12:44,007 --> 00:12:46,240
- People are watching me. / - It looks like a movie.

332
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:48,307
See you later.

333
00:12:49,073 --> 00:12:51,907
(4 hours and 15 minutes to Cebu from Incheon Airport)

334
00:12:51,907 --> 00:12:57,040
(4 hours and 10 minutes to Cebu from Gimhae Airport)

335
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:59,140
There's a direct flight that leaves from Busan too?

336
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:01,373
Yes, flights from Busan leave at night too.

337
00:13:01,373 --> 00:13:04,607
- That shows how much we love Cebu. / - Exactly.

338
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:07,307
- That's a great tip. / - Right now.

339
00:13:07,307 --> 00:13:10,340
I'm at Cebu International Airport in the Philippines.

340
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:12,273
Since I arrived before Sookyung,

341
00:13:12,273 --> 00:13:14,140
I'm waiting for her as we speak.

342
00:13:14,673 --> 00:13:16,373
Yes. It's hot here.

343
00:13:17,973 --> 00:13:19,773
By the way, the airport is really nice.

344
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:23,307
- The airport was really nice. / - That's newly built.

345
00:13:23,307 --> 00:13:24,807
(Cebu International Airport is being newly built)

346
00:13:26,307 --> 00:13:30,040
(Feeling embarrassed)

347
00:13:30,573 --> 00:13:32,807
I knew how to say hello in their language.

348
00:13:34,107 --> 00:13:37,607
(As she feels embarrassed, she says a greeting)

349
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,840
- Was that a greeting? / - Yes, it was.

350
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,307
Bye.

351
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:44,940
Bye.

352
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:46,607
(He leaves after saying good-bye)

353
00:13:47,807 --> 00:13:52,140
(Looking lonely)

354
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:52,973
Nami!

355
00:13:53,907 --> 00:13:54,673
Nami!

356
00:13:54,673 --> 00:13:59,107
(What is this familiar, high-pitched voice?)

357
00:13:59,107 --> 00:14:01,607
Sookyung!

358
00:14:01,607 --> 00:14:05,240
(Her affection explodes)

359
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:06,673
- Did you wait long? / - Yes.

360
00:14:07,073 --> 00:14:09,807
- You met in Cebu. / - Gosh, that must feel good.

361
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:12,307
- Seriously. / - It was so nice to see her.

362
00:14:12,307 --> 00:14:13,473
It would've felt strange.

363
00:14:13,473 --> 00:14:14,973
This is pretty late right now.

364
00:14:14,973 --> 00:14:16,740
- Yes, it's pretty late. / - That was 2 in the morning?

365
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:17,673
Yes, it was.

366
00:14:18,773 --> 00:14:20,840
- But... / - Let's start our trip tomorrow.

367
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:23,007
But we can't sleep right now

368
00:14:23,007 --> 00:14:26,673
because we were supposed to see the whale sharks.

369
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:30,207
- There are whale sharks in Oslob. / - Okay.

370
00:14:30,207 --> 00:14:32,173
We can see the whale sharks there.

371
00:14:32,173 --> 00:14:33,507
- Sharks? / - We can go into the water.

372
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:35,573
This is my first time hearing it.

373
00:14:35,573 --> 00:14:37,607
I've never heard about whale sharks in Cebu.

374
00:14:37,607 --> 00:14:38,473
Same here.

375
00:14:38,473 --> 00:14:40,607
- I like snorkeling. / - Really?

376
00:14:40,607 --> 00:14:41,807
I do too.

377
00:14:41,807 --> 00:14:44,073
- It'd be fun because... / - Right? It's pretty.

378
00:14:44,073 --> 00:14:48,040
- When else would you swim with a shark? / - Right.

379
00:14:49,273 --> 00:14:51,907
(They're happier to see these guests in Cebu)

380
00:14:51,907 --> 00:14:54,140
- It's over there. Look over there! / - Where?

381
00:14:55,940 --> 00:15:00,607
(They inhabit only in the clean seas)

382
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:08,140
(Meeting a whale shark is a rare experience)

383
00:15:10,007 --> 00:15:16,307
(They get to see them right before their eyes)

384
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:24,773
(This is a special once-in-a-lifetime experience)

385
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:32,807
(52 Tour will present the whale sharks shortly)

386
00:15:38,873 --> 00:15:42,040
But the whale sharks come early in the morning.

387
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:44,440
- They are early risers. / - They leave at a specific time.

388
00:15:45,073 --> 00:15:48,340
- We must bolt now to see them. / - Bolt to where?

389
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:50,440
We must leave now to meet the whale sharks.

390
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:52,240
We have to go to Oslob.

391
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:57,573
??Whale shark ??

392
00:15:57,573 --> 00:15:59,573
??Cute ??

393
00:16:00,973 --> 00:16:02,340
She's singing with Nami.

394
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:04,707
Right. She plays along too.

395
00:16:04,707 --> 00:16:07,607
(They set out to Oslob to see the whale sharks)

396
00:16:07,607 --> 00:16:09,773
We have a long way ahead of us. Alright.

397
00:16:09,773 --> 00:16:12,140
- Let's go meet the whale sharks! / - Don't forget me.

398
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:14,640
Okay, fine. Sookyung. Get in the car first.

399
00:16:15,807 --> 00:16:17,073
How will you get there?

400
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:19,373
I requested for a car to pick us up.

401
00:16:19,373 --> 00:16:22,340
- It's a round trip too. / - I see. That's nice.

402
00:16:22,707 --> 00:16:26,207
When you land at 2 a.m., you can sleep on the bus.

403
00:16:26,207 --> 00:16:31,673
(You can get pick-up from the airport)

404
00:16:33,107 --> 00:16:35,240
(Feeling excited)

405
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:38,007
- You didn't stop by at a hotel. / - We went right away.

406
00:16:38,507 --> 00:16:39,940
We saved a day in the end.

407
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:42,740
That's a good plan. When you arrive in Cebu...

408
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:44,040
- You fall asleep. / - Right.

409
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:45,640
It's better to go there now.

410
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:46,973
The best part of such trips is

411
00:16:46,973 --> 00:16:48,673
you can't see anything at night but in the morning,

412
00:16:48,673 --> 00:16:51,073
you open your eyes and you're like, "Wow."

413
00:16:51,073 --> 00:16:52,440
- You'd be impressed. / - That's true.

414
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:54,007
- We were just like that. / - Right.

415
00:16:55,707 --> 00:16:57,940
(52 Tour rests up while heading to Oslob)

416
00:16:57,940 --> 00:16:59,907
(As they travel to Oslob, the morning breaks)

417
00:16:59,907 --> 00:17:00,940
The sun is rising.

418
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:03,040
It was great at dawn.

419
00:17:03,507 --> 00:17:04,707
- Right? / - Yes.

420
00:17:04,707 --> 00:17:06,573
- That'd feel strange. / - It was.

421
00:17:06,573 --> 00:17:08,040
(It's a 4-hour drive)

422
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:09,340
(Conquering the nature in Oslob, Cebu)

423
00:17:09,340 --> 00:17:13,107
(Local breakfast)

424
00:17:14,073 --> 00:17:17,673
(Hour 40 of the 52 Tour)

425
00:17:18,607 --> 00:17:21,140
- Now, we will... / - We will...

426
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:23,107
We'll see the whale sharks now, right?

427
00:17:23,107 --> 00:17:25,207
Before we see the whale sharks,

428
00:17:25,207 --> 00:17:28,440
there's this great restaurant that serves

429
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:32,440
delicious food and has the best view.

430
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:33,273
Aren't you hungry?

431
00:17:33,673 --> 00:17:36,707
- Yes, it took us hours to get here. / - Right.

432
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:39,473
- You look tired. Are you okay? / - She looks so tired.

433
00:17:39,473 --> 00:17:41,407
- She looks so tired. / - Nami.

434
00:17:41,407 --> 00:17:43,940
That's not it. It's the first time I've seen this.

435
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:45,007
It's because the sun is in your eyes, right?

436
00:17:45,007 --> 00:17:46,673
- It was bothering our eyes. / - It was too bright.

437
00:17:46,673 --> 00:17:47,607
- The sun was really bright. / - You look like that...

438
00:17:47,607 --> 00:17:49,107
After the 4-hour flight and 4-hour car ride.

439
00:17:49,507 --> 00:17:52,340
- The ocean is their view. Yes. / - Really?

440
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:53,440
Let's go this way.

441
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:57,407
- The weather is great here. / - Isn't it great?

442
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:59,240
Hello.

443
00:17:59,507 --> 00:18:00,673
Sookyung, it's this way.

444
00:18:00,673 --> 00:18:02,140
(What will their first meal be like in Cebu?)

445
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:08,040
(The refreshing scenery blows away their sleepiness)

446
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:09,940
Look. The view isn't obstructed.

447
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:12,007
Right. It's lifting my spirits.

448
00:18:12,007 --> 00:18:14,373
- It's not from a hotel. It's local. / - Right.

449
00:18:14,373 --> 00:18:15,473
Local restaurant.

450
00:18:16,107 --> 00:18:19,273
So the restaurant is open at that early hour?

451
00:18:19,273 --> 00:18:20,307
- It is. / - They start early.

452
00:18:20,307 --> 00:18:21,907
- They do? / - It's because...

453
00:18:21,907 --> 00:18:23,673
A lot of people go there for the whale shark tour.

454
00:18:24,273 --> 00:18:25,607
The restaurant is near the tour.

455
00:18:25,607 --> 00:18:27,307
- It's here. / - Right? What's here?

456
00:18:27,307 --> 00:18:28,907
- Our breakfast is here. / - I see. Our breakfast.

457
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:30,107
Hi.

458
00:18:33,173 --> 00:18:35,140
- It's the sticky rice. / - What is that?

459
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:36,540
- Is that rice? / - It's sticky rice.

460
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:38,140
- Right. / - It's rice...

461
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:39,673
- Isn't that pork? / - Yes, it is.

462
00:18:39,673 --> 00:18:42,173
It's like a barbecue.

463
00:18:42,173 --> 00:18:43,973
- Chicken and pork. / - It costs $3.20.

464
00:18:43,973 --> 00:18:45,540
- That's so cheap. / - Isn't it so cheap?

465
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:46,540
This is great.

466
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:47,540
(Chicken tocino, $3.20)

467
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:48,673
(Pork adobo, $3.20)

468
00:18:48,673 --> 00:18:50,173
Is it similar to our pork bulgogi meal?

469
00:18:50,173 --> 00:18:52,440
- The pork dish... / - It's braised in soy sauce.

470
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:53,707
It's braised in soy sauce.

471
00:18:55,273 --> 00:18:57,473
- The egg... / - 2 dishes don't go over $10.

472
00:18:57,473 --> 00:18:58,507
- Right. / - Right.

473
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,440
(She tries the pork adobo first)

474
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:01,907
It's braised in soy sauce.

475
00:19:02,573 --> 00:19:04,473
- Isn't it like braised short rib? / - Right.

476
00:19:04,473 --> 00:19:05,673
- It must be nice and salty. / - It is.

477
00:19:05,673 --> 00:19:07,407
- This tastes like braised beef. / - That must be good.

478
00:19:07,407 --> 00:19:10,573
That's what it tastes like, but this is just...

479
00:19:10,873 --> 00:19:13,407
Served without the soy sauce.

480
00:19:14,540 --> 00:19:16,573
- Let me try the chicken. / - Try the chicken.

481
00:19:17,707 --> 00:19:18,873
I like it.

482
00:19:20,107 --> 00:19:21,540
Both dishes were braised in soy sauce.

483
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:26,107
- This is my type of food. Yes. / - Is it?

484
00:19:26,107 --> 00:19:29,273
In Korea, it's similar to soy sauce charcoal chicken.

485
00:19:30,273 --> 00:19:32,340
- It tastes like that chicken. / - Right?

486
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:33,840
I can taste the smoky flavors.

487
00:19:34,607 --> 00:19:37,007
- I can taste the smoky flavors. / - Right?

488
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:40,640
Sookyung, you have a palate of a kid.

489
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:43,573
I'm like a kid. And this is perfect for people like me.

490
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:46,107
I'm glad.

491
00:19:46,907 --> 00:19:49,573
We should hurry over there while they're waiting

492
00:19:49,573 --> 00:19:52,640
because I know that they go away at noon.

493
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,707
Their work hours are pretty short.

494
00:19:54,707 --> 00:19:56,507
Yes, they're short. We must get going.

495
00:19:56,507 --> 00:19:58,307
(They must finish up and go meet the whale sharks)

496
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:05,907
(Meat on her left fork, rice on her right spoon)

497
00:20:11,573 --> 00:20:13,073
It's like a commercial.

498
00:20:13,073 --> 00:20:14,840
- It does look like a commercial. / - She's an actress.

499
00:20:15,773 --> 00:20:19,507
(52 Tour fills up their stomachs first)

500
00:20:22,507 --> 00:20:25,207
- That's the ocean. / - Exactly.

501
00:20:25,207 --> 00:20:27,573
(It's time to really meet the whale sharks)

502
00:20:27,573 --> 00:20:29,040
(Conquering the nature in Oslob, Cebu)

503
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:32,640
(Whale sharks)

504
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:35,740
(We saw the whale sharks in Cancun, Mexico)

505
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:38,107
- Taegon and Kangnam. / - Right.

506
00:20:38,107 --> 00:20:39,373
That's Mexico.

507
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:41,673
It startled me.

508
00:20:43,007 --> 00:20:47,873
(How will the whale sharks in Oslob look?)

509
00:20:47,873 --> 00:20:48,940
(5-minute walk from the restaurant)

510
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:50,273
- 5-minute walk? / - Right.

511
00:20:50,807 --> 00:20:51,907
- But... / - It's quite close.

512
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:03,940
- We've arrived at last. / - We're finally going, right?

513
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:04,740
Yes.

514
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:06,573
- Sookyung, let me explain. / - Yes?

515
00:21:07,107 --> 00:21:09,373
This place is managed by the government,

516
00:21:09,373 --> 00:21:11,007
so there's a time limit.

517
00:21:11,007 --> 00:21:12,273
- Does it mean we must hurry? / - Yes.

518
00:21:12,273 --> 00:21:14,307
That's why we came here in a hurry.

519
00:21:14,307 --> 00:21:16,840
- That's right. / - But look at all these people.

520
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:18,673
- There are so many people. / - It's packed, right?

521
00:21:19,273 --> 00:21:20,373
It's no joke.

522
00:21:20,373 --> 00:21:22,173
- I can't believe this. / - It's so crowded.

523
00:21:22,173 --> 00:21:24,073
(It's packed even in the morning)

524
00:21:24,073 --> 00:21:25,440
Wow, no way.

525
00:21:27,073 --> 00:21:29,140
(In Mexico, they had to head out for 3 hours)

526
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:31,807
That's true. They had to go for 3 hours.

527
00:21:31,807 --> 00:21:33,973
There aren't many places where

528
00:21:33,973 --> 00:21:35,273
you can see whale sharks.

529
00:21:38,673 --> 00:21:40,173
(In Cebu, it only takes 5 minutes)

530
00:21:40,173 --> 00:21:41,607
5 minutes?

531
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:48,340
(When the fisherman throws the food into the sea)

532
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:49,707
(Whale sharks follow him around)

533
00:21:49,707 --> 00:21:52,240
(Yummy)

534
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:53,640
- Goodness. / - It follows you.

535
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:55,373
It follows him like a goldfish.

536
00:21:55,373 --> 00:21:56,973
- Is it a pet? / - The whale sharks...

537
00:21:56,973 --> 00:21:58,007
(A goldfish? A pet?)

538
00:21:58,373 --> 00:22:01,073
- Is it a pet? / - They come for shrimp.

539
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,640
They're so cute.

540
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:06,007
- You have to go early. / - Yes, early in the morning.

541
00:22:06,007 --> 00:22:08,207
- Gosh. / - It's really big.

542
00:22:08,207 --> 00:22:10,840
(Snorkeling with whale sharks)

543
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:13,340
(Whale sharks can be seen from 6 a.m. to 11 a.m.)

544
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:16,007
If you go there on the weekend and

545
00:22:16,007 --> 00:22:17,607
swim with the whale sharks...

546
00:22:17,607 --> 00:22:18,907
- You'll be really energized. / - Yes.

547
00:22:18,907 --> 00:22:21,140
That would keep me energized for a year.

548
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:22,607
(They put on life vests)

549
00:22:22,607 --> 00:22:24,540
- I'm color coordinated. / - What?

550
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:25,673
You really are!

551
00:22:28,073 --> 00:22:30,173
(Finally)

552
00:22:30,173 --> 00:22:33,040
(They head out)

553
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:34,507
We're finally going to see the whale shark.

554
00:22:37,907 --> 00:22:39,073
It's nice.

555
00:22:39,273 --> 00:22:42,307
The ocean in the Philippines is so pretty.

556
00:22:43,673 --> 00:22:45,040
Yes. It's really pretty.

557
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:50,373
(The clear and pretty sea of Cebu)

558
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:52,940
- The color is so nice. / - It's so clear.

559
00:22:54,407 --> 00:22:57,140
- You're going to a deeper place. / - Yes.

560
00:22:58,873 --> 00:23:04,173
(Around where the color changes to darker blue)

561
00:23:04,773 --> 00:23:06,173
Look. He's throwing the food.

562
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:08,573
- He's throwing shrimp. / - Yes.

563
00:23:08,573 --> 00:23:09,740
He's throwing them over there.

564
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:11,140
They feed them.

565
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:13,507
Yes. They follow you when you throw them food.

566
00:23:13,507 --> 00:23:15,807
Are they small? It's quite shallow here...

567
00:23:15,807 --> 00:23:16,873
- Over there! / - Where?

568
00:23:16,873 --> 00:23:17,973
Look over there!

569
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:19,707
- Hi! / - Can you see?

570
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:22,407
Over there. Whale shark!

571
00:23:22,407 --> 00:23:24,073
- It's so cute. / - Goodness.

572
00:23:24,073 --> 00:23:25,907
Goodness, it's a whale shark.

573
00:23:25,907 --> 00:23:28,340
You can see them even if you aren't in the water.

574
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:32,107
(The whale shark's spots are clearly visible)

575
00:23:32,107 --> 00:23:34,473
Sookyung, it's a whale shark.

576
00:23:34,473 --> 00:23:36,473
- I want to see it. / - Did you see it?

577
00:23:36,473 --> 00:23:38,940
- No, I want to see it in the water. / - I see.

578
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:40,240
It's over there!

579
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:41,540
He's bringing it over here.

580
00:23:43,173 --> 00:23:44,307
"He's bringing it."

581
00:23:45,407 --> 00:23:47,373
- "He's bringing it." / - Goodness.

582
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:49,740
(Bringing it over with food)

583
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:50,940
- Unbelievable. / - Hi.

584
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:52,107
Goodness.

585
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:56,173
- It's following him. / - It follows him.

586
00:23:56,173 --> 00:23:59,007
- Gosh, how is this possible? / - It's like a puppy.

587
00:24:00,307 --> 00:24:01,407
You have to clean it with spit.

588
00:24:01,407 --> 00:24:03,273
It's faster to clean it with spit.

589
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:06,107
- Are you going in the water now? / - Yes.

590
00:24:06,207 --> 00:24:07,340
It's here.

591
00:24:09,207 --> 00:24:11,307
Nami is in a hurry.

592
00:24:11,307 --> 00:24:12,707
Let's go in quickly.

593
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:15,840
- Water. / - Whale shark.

594
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:17,340
- Where? / - There.

595
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:19,273
(The whale shark is right in front of them)

596
00:24:19,273 --> 00:24:20,373
Whale shark.

597
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:27,307
(Come in quick)

598
00:24:40,873 --> 00:24:42,973
- Wow. / - It's right in front of you.

599
00:24:44,073 --> 00:24:46,140
It's right in front of you.

600
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:50,073
- Wow. / - Goodness.

601
00:24:52,540 --> 00:24:55,107
- Wow. / - It's right in front of you.

602
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:02,273
(Whale shark, Rhincodon typus)

603
00:25:02,273 --> 00:25:04,807
(They grow between 12 to 18m)

604
00:25:04,807 --> 00:25:07,007
- Goodness. / - It wants to eat salted shrimp.

605
00:25:07,007 --> 00:25:09,873
- It's so cute. / - Gosh.

606
00:25:09,873 --> 00:25:11,573
- Goodness. / - It's so cute.

607
00:25:11,573 --> 00:25:14,507
- It's huge, but it's so cute. / - Isn't the tail 2m long?

608
00:25:14,507 --> 00:25:17,273
(A whale shark appeared suddenly in 2011)

609
00:25:17,273 --> 00:25:20,173
(Fishermen started feeding it and more of them came)

610
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:27,207
(They are gentle in nature and do not attack people)

611
00:25:27,207 --> 00:25:32,140
(They only eat salted shrimp thrown to them)

612
00:25:48,207 --> 00:25:49,673
- It feels weird. / - Precautions.

613
00:25:49,673 --> 00:25:52,140
- You must not touch them. / - You can't touch them.

614
00:25:52,607 --> 00:25:56,173
You have to stay calm so they don't get scared.

615
00:25:56,173 --> 00:25:58,140
That's right. You shouldn't touch them.

616
00:25:58,140 --> 00:26:01,440
They were eating right in front of me. I felt like...

617
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:04,207
- I was getting sucked in. / - They're so close.

618
00:26:05,307 --> 00:26:06,973
- They know we're coming. / - Get a hold of yourself.

619
00:26:06,973 --> 00:26:08,707
Get a hold of yourself.

620
00:26:08,707 --> 00:26:11,040
My son loves whale sharks.

621
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:12,707
I really want to go.

622
00:26:24,173 --> 00:26:31,340
(Whale sharks don't shy away)

623
00:26:33,607 --> 00:26:34,873
Is that Sookyung?

624
00:26:34,873 --> 00:26:36,573
I was scared.

625
00:26:36,573 --> 00:26:37,707
(What is she doing?)

626
00:26:37,707 --> 00:26:40,140
- Who is it? Is that you? / - Are you having fun?

627
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:43,573
- She's hanging on dearly. / - It's because...

628
00:26:43,573 --> 00:26:44,473
No way.

629
00:26:44,473 --> 00:26:46,273
- How is that possible? / - You're that flexible?

630
00:26:46,273 --> 00:26:47,940
Are you hanging on?

631
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:49,373
- No. / - You're going backward.

632
00:26:49,373 --> 00:26:50,907
Sookyung!

633
00:26:50,907 --> 00:26:52,907
Why didn't you just stay on the boat?

634
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:55,907
- I wanted to see it. / - You're so funny.

635
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:58,940
- Because it's so close. / - It was too close.

636
00:27:00,873 --> 00:27:02,940
- Look at your legs. / - You're holding on so dearly.

637
00:27:03,473 --> 00:27:04,640
Help.

638
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:08,473
Wait. I'm not ready to meet you.

639
00:27:09,707 --> 00:27:10,807
Don't come near.

640
00:27:12,273 --> 00:27:15,073
(She is hanging on with her legs)

641
00:27:15,073 --> 00:27:16,173
Look at that.

642
00:27:17,107 --> 00:27:18,973
- In case it touches your legs? / - That's too much.

643
00:27:18,973 --> 00:27:20,273
(But I'm cute, right?)

644
00:27:20,273 --> 00:27:22,473
- It's so funny. / - Goodness.

645
00:27:23,273 --> 00:27:25,040
- Are you okay? / - Yes.

646
00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:29,307
There's a baby shark next to it. Is it its baby?

647
00:27:29,307 --> 00:27:30,707
I don't think so.

648
00:27:32,407 --> 00:27:34,673
It feeds on it's...

649
00:27:34,673 --> 00:27:36,507
- It's a suckerfish. / - Suckerfish.

650
00:27:36,507 --> 00:27:38,040
They clean the whale shark's body.

651
00:27:38,673 --> 00:27:41,573
It sure is a shark. A suckerfish is stuck to it.

652
00:27:42,273 --> 00:27:43,373
It cleans the body.

653
00:27:43,373 --> 00:27:44,740
- Good? / - Good.

654
00:27:47,207 --> 00:27:50,707
(Thanks)

655
00:27:52,307 --> 00:27:53,940
Look. It's really close to me.

656
00:27:57,607 --> 00:28:05,573
(They regroup and jump in for the second time)

657
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:11,073
(She's pointing at something)

658
00:28:11,073 --> 00:28:12,740
- What did you see? / - What did you see?

659
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:15,773
That there are more?

660
00:28:15,773 --> 00:28:17,507
There were a lot of whale sharks.

661
00:28:18,073 --> 00:28:19,273
- Amazing. / - More came.

662
00:28:19,273 --> 00:28:21,273
There were two, and then three.

663
00:28:21,273 --> 00:28:23,407
Another one came because we were there.

664
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:26,007
- Goodness. / - They're standing.

665
00:28:26,007 --> 00:28:27,707
- My gosh. / - I was surprised to see them stand.

666
00:28:30,140 --> 00:28:36,307
(They keep opening and closing their mouths)

667
00:28:37,207 --> 00:28:39,040
- She's saying there are 3 sharks. / - 3 sharks.

668
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:40,273
- Three sharks. / - Amazing.

669
00:28:40,273 --> 00:28:42,007
(There are 3 sharks, not 2)

670
00:28:42,540 --> 00:28:44,140
Gosh, it's huge.

671
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:45,507
(One shark)

672
00:28:45,507 --> 00:28:47,773
It's hard to see even one in an aquarium.

673
00:28:47,773 --> 00:28:50,140
- It's lovely. / - It's so cute.

674
00:28:50,373 --> 00:28:53,207
They're hard to see, but there are three of them.

675
00:28:53,207 --> 00:28:55,573
- Yes. / - It's so amazing that they're so close.

676
00:28:55,573 --> 00:29:03,707
(There are three whale sharks)

677
00:29:06,973 --> 00:29:11,407
(From above, you can see four sharks)

678
00:29:11,407 --> 00:29:12,707
- Were there 4 sharks? / - Yes.

679
00:29:13,007 --> 00:29:14,407
There are more of them than the boats.

680
00:29:14,907 --> 00:29:16,240
Four sharks came.

681
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:19,407
- They came to have breakfast. / - Yes, for breakfast.

682
00:29:22,273 --> 00:29:25,273
How can they look like that? They're so cute.

683
00:29:25,273 --> 00:29:27,740
- They're so cute. / - Their mouths are so cute.

684
00:29:27,973 --> 00:29:30,207
- It's so cute. / - Their eyes.

685
00:29:30,707 --> 00:29:31,740
- It came. / - They're...

686
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:33,507
- It's huge. / - It's really big.

687
00:29:33,507 --> 00:29:41,407
(Finally, they enjoy snorkeling)

688
00:29:45,073 --> 00:29:47,973
Don't you feel blissful when you're next to them?

689
00:29:47,973 --> 00:29:50,507
- You get overwhelmed, don't you? / - Yes, you do.

690
00:29:50,507 --> 00:29:53,107
- I know that feeling. / - It's like a spaceship.

691
00:29:53,107 --> 00:29:54,307
Yes.

692
00:29:58,173 --> 00:29:59,807
Isn't it so pretty?

693
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:03,007
Everyone has fallen for the whale sharks.

694
00:30:03,007 --> 00:30:05,973
I think Yujin will go there soon.

695
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:07,440
Me? I want to go.

696
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:11,340
Whale sharks are so cool!

697
00:30:11,807 --> 00:30:13,207
I'm not scared.

698
00:30:13,973 --> 00:30:16,773
I can say hi to them again.

699
00:30:17,473 --> 00:30:19,073
When they are eating...

700
00:30:20,107 --> 00:30:21,740
They suck in everything.

701
00:30:22,107 --> 00:30:25,207
I felt like I was going to get sucked in too.

702
00:30:27,973 --> 00:30:29,207
The mouth is huge.

703
00:30:29,207 --> 00:30:30,540
- Really? / - Yes.

704
00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:32,073
(Is someone talking about my mouth?)

705
00:30:35,473 --> 00:30:36,573
How was it?

706
00:30:36,573 --> 00:30:38,807
- It was fun. / - Was it? Really?

707
00:30:38,807 --> 00:30:40,140
Why am I so tired?

708
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:43,273
(Snorkeling with the whale sharks is over)

709
00:30:44,073 --> 00:30:45,273
Wasn't that so much fun?

710
00:30:45,707 --> 00:30:48,173
- Seriously. / - I want to try that.

711
00:30:48,173 --> 00:30:49,573
- Awesome. / - Was it Alright?

712
00:30:49,573 --> 00:30:50,607
Yes.

713
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:53,940
You were so tired just now.

714
00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:56,640
I was really tired earlier.

715
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:59,207
- But now I feel so refreshed. / - Really?

716
00:30:59,207 --> 00:31:00,307
- Wasn't it fun? / - Yes.

717
00:31:00,307 --> 00:31:01,573
Next up,

718
00:31:01,573 --> 00:31:03,173
I'll take you to an even more amazing place.

719
00:31:03,173 --> 00:31:04,840
- More than this? / - Yes.

720
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:07,007
You'll love it.

721
00:31:07,007 --> 00:31:09,373
Everyone loves that place.

722
00:31:09,373 --> 00:31:10,573
We didn't get to take pictures.

723
00:31:10,573 --> 00:31:12,740
Yeah. Let's go take some photos.

724
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:15,740
We were so busy looking at the whale sharks.

725
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:17,140
- Let's go. / - Let's go quickly.

726
00:31:17,140 --> 00:31:19,573
Let's take a quick shower first.

727
00:31:21,307 --> 00:31:22,473
(Conquering the nature in Oslob, Cebu)

728
00:31:22,473 --> 00:31:25,707
(Tumalog Falls)

729
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:29,007
You can swim in Tumalog Falls.

730
00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:31,307
- Tumalog Falls. / - She studied really hard.

731
00:31:31,307 --> 00:31:33,073
Nami must've studied very hard.

732
00:31:33,073 --> 00:31:34,540
It was an inspiration for "Avatar."

733
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:37,307
- Did it inspire "Avatar?" / - Yes.

734
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:43,673
(15 minutes by car to Tumalog Falls)

735
00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:47,607
We saw the sea...

736
00:31:47,607 --> 00:31:48,773
Now the waterfall.

737
00:31:48,773 --> 00:31:53,640
This is the entrance to Tumalog Falls.

738
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:57,673
We can't get in with a car.

739
00:31:57,673 --> 00:31:58,973
Then do we have to walk there?

740
00:31:58,973 --> 00:32:00,973
Do you see motorbikes here?

741
00:32:00,973 --> 00:32:03,540
We can get there with a motorbike.

742
00:32:03,540 --> 00:32:06,807
The motorbikes are the transportation

743
00:32:06,807 --> 00:32:07,607
to Tumalog Falls.

744
00:32:07,607 --> 00:32:09,540
- I was very popular there. / - Shall we ask for a ride...

745
00:32:09,540 --> 00:32:11,373
- And go to Tumalog Falls? / - Okay.

746
00:32:11,373 --> 00:32:14,040
- I'm nervous. / - Just trust me and follow me.

747
00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:17,173
- Okay. / - Hop on.

748
00:32:17,173 --> 00:32:18,507
(Motorbike ride, $1)

749
00:32:18,507 --> 00:32:19,840
Honey, let's go.

750
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:22,173
- It's only $1. / - They're available from 7 a.m...

751
00:32:22,173 --> 00:32:24,440
- To 4 p.m. / - Let's go.

752
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:27,007
It looks like Sookyung is experienced with motorbikes.

753
00:32:27,273 --> 00:32:28,973
She's holding the grip with only one hand.

754
00:32:28,973 --> 00:32:31,940
- She's experienced. / - That one-handed grip.

755
00:32:46,807 --> 00:32:49,573
Honey, let's go!

756
00:32:52,273 --> 00:32:54,473
(3 minutes from the entrance to the falls)

757
00:32:54,473 --> 00:32:56,140
I've never heard of this.

758
00:32:57,273 --> 00:32:59,373
Many people don't know about this place.

759
00:32:59,373 --> 00:33:00,907
Nami,

760
00:33:00,907 --> 00:33:03,373
it would've been horrible if we walked all the way.

761
00:33:06,773 --> 00:33:07,873
Are we already here?

762
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:12,407
- 47. / - 47?

763
00:33:12,407 --> 00:33:15,973
- 47. / - Yes.

764
00:33:15,973 --> 00:33:19,540
- They'll wait there. / - You remember the number.

765
00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:20,640
- See you. / - See you.

766
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:23,707
I feel like I'm suddenly in a jungle.

767
00:33:23,707 --> 00:33:25,407
Right? Look at that.

768
00:33:25,407 --> 00:33:26,607
- Okay, go. / - Thank you.

769
00:33:26,607 --> 00:33:27,740
Isn't this a ticket?

770
00:33:27,740 --> 00:33:29,473
- Thank you. / - The entrance fee is 40 cents.

771
00:33:29,473 --> 00:33:32,373
- Yes. / - I like that it's so cheap.

772
00:33:32,373 --> 00:33:33,873
- Sookyung! / - It's really amazing.

773
00:33:35,373 --> 00:33:37,440
- Sookyung! / - It's really amazing.

774
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:40,140
Hang on a second. This is insane.

775
00:33:40,140 --> 00:33:41,173
I told you it'll be amazing.

776
00:33:41,173 --> 00:33:43,040
- Their reactions are great. / - Sookyung is excited to...

777
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:43,907
Be outside of her home.

778
00:33:43,907 --> 00:33:45,873
- I know. / - Everything is fascinating to her.

779
00:33:46,007 --> 00:33:47,673
Sookyung is excited about everything.

780
00:33:47,673 --> 00:33:49,907
- She is. / - It was really nice.

781
00:33:49,907 --> 00:33:52,840
This makes the one who planned the trip so happy.

782
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:54,373
- It's amazing here. / - Hang on.

783
00:33:54,540 --> 00:33:59,407
Hold on. It's amazing. Didn't I tell you that?

784
00:33:59,407 --> 00:34:01,607
- Is it right there like that? / - Yes.

785
00:34:02,773 --> 00:34:06,740
(Tumalog Falls is the biggest waterfall in Cebu)

786
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:10,573
(The falls is 100m high)

787
00:34:10,573 --> 00:34:13,773
- The water falls from up there. / - It looks so cool.

788
00:34:13,773 --> 00:34:15,940
- It's 100m high. / - 100m?

789
00:34:16,373 --> 00:34:19,907
(There's one more special thing about this waterfall)

790
00:34:21,173 --> 00:34:22,073
(The water is vivid emerald color)

791
00:34:22,073 --> 00:34:24,207
- You can go into the water? / - Yes.

792
00:34:24,207 --> 00:34:26,973
- That's amazing. / - We were there in the rainy season.

793
00:34:26,973 --> 00:34:29,873
So there was quite a lot of water.

794
00:34:29,873 --> 00:34:33,273
You have to go to Tumalog Falls in the rainy season.

795
00:34:34,140 --> 00:34:35,740
- Sookyung, look at this. / - It looks awesome.

796
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:36,940
It's so cool, isn't it?

797
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:38,040
What is that?

798
00:34:38,807 --> 00:34:39,840
Look at that color.

799
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:41,307
The color of the water is so beautiful.

800
00:34:41,307 --> 00:34:45,440
Sookyung, this is the place that inspired "Avatar."

801
00:34:46,373 --> 00:34:48,573
- This is the place? / - Yes.

802
00:34:48,573 --> 00:34:51,607
- Really? / - It's based on this waterfall.

803
00:34:51,607 --> 00:34:52,740
Even before Nami told me this,

804
00:34:52,740 --> 00:34:53,773
as soon as I saw the falls,

805
00:34:53,773 --> 00:34:56,873
I said it was just like in "Avatar."

806
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:59,573
- And it was actually related. / - Exactly.

807
00:34:59,573 --> 00:35:01,073
Shall we go in as well?

808
00:35:02,073 --> 00:35:03,240
I'm so cold.

809
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:05,373
Are you cold? Then you stay here. I'll go in.

810
00:35:05,373 --> 00:35:06,707
- You can go in. / - Okay.

811
00:35:07,307 --> 00:35:08,973
The water is ice cold.

812
00:35:08,973 --> 00:35:10,540
(Nami goes into the water first)

813
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:13,840
(Excited)

814
00:35:14,207 --> 00:35:15,907
It's so refreshing!

815
00:35:15,907 --> 00:35:18,840
(She gets a waterfalls massage)

816
00:35:20,073 --> 00:35:25,973
(Being under the waterfall reminds her of something)

817
00:35:27,507 --> 00:35:31,140
(Training)

818
00:35:37,107 --> 00:35:39,173
If you're a comedian...

819
00:35:39,173 --> 00:35:40,340
That's a must.

820
00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:44,007
Sookyung! It's so refreshing here.

821
00:35:44,740 --> 00:35:46,473
Just trust me. Come here.

822
00:35:47,207 --> 00:35:48,207
(She refuses)

823
00:35:48,207 --> 00:35:50,673
But it's a waste not to go into such a beautiful place.

824
00:35:50,673 --> 00:35:53,507
Sookyung, come on. Come here.

825
00:35:54,073 --> 00:35:56,173
- Friend. / - Friend.

826
00:35:56,173 --> 00:35:58,707
- Come down. / - Come down.

827
00:35:59,707 --> 00:36:00,840
I asked them to say it.

828
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:02,507
(After much persuasion)

829
00:36:02,507 --> 00:36:03,907
My goodness.

830
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:09,473
- My friend. / - She's coming.

831
00:36:09,473 --> 00:36:10,373
- Friend. / - She's coming.

832
00:36:10,373 --> 00:36:13,507
Friend, my friend. She's cold.

833
00:36:15,773 --> 00:36:17,773
- Was it cold? / - The water was so cold.

834
00:36:17,773 --> 00:36:18,773
It was really cold.

835
00:36:20,140 --> 00:36:21,507
Sookyung, it's refreshing, isn't it?

836
00:36:26,007 --> 00:36:31,907
(Sookyung and Nami had a lot of fun at the waterfall)

837
00:36:31,907 --> 00:36:33,807
If it's like this, I'd love to jump in there.

838
00:36:33,807 --> 00:36:35,607
It'd be amazing to be in cold water

839
00:36:35,607 --> 00:36:36,307
in such a hot country.

840
00:36:36,307 --> 00:36:37,140
It must be amazing.

841
00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:41,740
(Nami is the most excited person)

842
00:36:42,507 --> 00:36:45,107
I heard this is similar to

843
00:36:45,107 --> 00:36:47,673
Cenote in Mexico, a natural swimming pool.

844
00:36:48,907 --> 00:36:50,340
There's no need to go to Cancun.

845
00:36:50,340 --> 00:36:51,507
- That's right. / - This is nearer.

846
00:36:51,507 --> 00:36:53,707
- You can see whale sharks here too. / - Yes.

847
00:36:53,707 --> 00:36:56,773
It's here! Don't come to me!

848
00:36:56,773 --> 00:36:59,173
- Don't come to me! / - They're so cute.

849
00:36:59,507 --> 00:37:00,973
- You have never done this? / - No.

850
00:37:00,973 --> 00:37:02,107
- Really? / - Really.

851
00:37:02,340 --> 00:37:03,307
Aren't they cute?

852
00:37:03,307 --> 00:37:06,007
I've never seen doctor fish in nature.

853
00:37:06,007 --> 00:37:08,107
There are so many. I must have so much dead skin.

854
00:37:08,107 --> 00:37:10,607
I don't like being touched.

855
00:37:10,607 --> 00:37:11,673
- Really? / - Yes.

856
00:37:11,673 --> 00:37:13,373
I'll take what I can

857
00:37:13,373 --> 00:37:14,973
since I never get touched.

858
00:37:16,307 --> 00:37:17,440
This is amazing.

859
00:37:18,207 --> 00:37:20,507
- They must've had a lot to feed on. / - They're here.

860
00:37:20,507 --> 00:37:21,907
It tickles!

861
00:37:21,907 --> 00:37:23,873
Sookyung's reaction is great.

862
00:37:23,873 --> 00:37:25,373
(Great in reaction)

863
00:37:25,373 --> 00:37:26,740
They were all firsts for me.

864
00:37:26,740 --> 00:37:28,140
(Is it because she hasn't tried those things?)

865
00:37:28,607 --> 00:37:34,373
(Sookyung and Nami have a relaxing time)

866
00:37:36,140 --> 00:37:38,873
- They're having a party here. / - I know.

867
00:37:39,140 --> 00:37:41,607
Now they're full,

868
00:37:41,607 --> 00:37:42,973
shall we go eat something too?

869
00:37:42,973 --> 00:37:45,173
- Sounds good. / - Let's go.

870
00:37:45,173 --> 00:37:46,573
- Let's go eat something good. / - Okay.

871
00:37:46,573 --> 00:37:47,707
A proper meal.

872
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:50,607
- Food. / - Now it's time for dinner.

873
00:37:50,607 --> 00:37:52,773
It's time to have a proper meal.

874
00:37:53,307 --> 00:37:56,207
(Hour 30 of the 52 Tour)

875
00:37:56,207 --> 00:37:57,907
Are we really going to eat?

876
00:37:58,407 --> 00:37:59,707
Of course.

877
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:03,207
This is where we're having dinner.

878
00:38:04,507 --> 00:38:07,407
- It's a resort. / - Here? A resort?

879
00:38:07,873 --> 00:38:10,740
They have Western food here. It's European.

880
00:38:11,173 --> 00:38:13,740
They have European dishes.

881
00:38:16,073 --> 00:38:18,007
(It's a restaurant in a resort right in front of the sea)

882
00:38:18,007 --> 00:38:19,773
(Even if you're not a guest here, you can eat here)

883
00:38:19,773 --> 00:38:22,107
It might be a good idea to stay here as well.

884
00:38:22,107 --> 00:38:24,373
- Right? / - It's a great location to stay...

885
00:38:24,373 --> 00:38:25,307
And do other activities.

886
00:38:25,307 --> 00:38:27,107
We can eat with an ocean view.

887
00:38:27,107 --> 00:38:28,473
It's a great location.

888
00:38:32,273 --> 00:38:34,340
- There's a lizard over there. / - Where?

889
00:38:34,340 --> 00:38:35,607
You're right.

890
00:38:35,607 --> 00:38:37,040
It looks like a painting.

891
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:38,973
She is again fascinated.

892
00:38:38,973 --> 00:38:41,840
- She's so fascinated. / - Everything's fascinating.

893
00:38:42,507 --> 00:38:44,440
- Everything was fascinating. / - Right.

894
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:46,107
It's coming.

895
00:38:47,373 --> 00:38:50,040
- Thank you. / - Thank you.

896
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:53,507
(The dishes go well with the open ocean view)

897
00:38:54,207 --> 00:38:56,673
(The restaurant serves Filipino fusion dishes)

898
00:38:56,673 --> 00:38:59,507
(A popular place for tourists)

899
00:39:00,407 --> 00:39:03,473
(They start with a glass of beer)

900
00:39:03,473 --> 00:39:06,273
- Wow, what is that? / - Is it a regular pizza?

901
00:39:06,273 --> 00:39:09,240
Are there more tourists than locals in Oslob?

902
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:10,740
- Yes. / - There are a lot of tourists.

903
00:39:10,740 --> 00:39:13,073
They serve Filipino fusion dishes.

904
00:39:13,073 --> 00:39:16,373
- After swimming... / - It looks delicious.

905
00:39:16,373 --> 00:39:18,140
- Pizza and beer are the best. / - Exactly.

906

- Cheers. / - Cheers.

907
00:39:22,007 --> 00:39:24,807
(The beer is so refreshing)

908
00:39:24,807 --> 00:39:26,673
- It's just like a soda. / - Is it?

909
00:39:32,007 --> 00:39:34,773
- I normally don't drink. / - She can't handle her drinks.

910
00:39:34,773 --> 00:39:36,173
But I drank just a bit.

911
00:39:37,573 --> 00:39:39,240
- It's refreshing, isn't it? / - It is.

912
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:40,240
(A glass of beer after swimming is the best)

913
00:39:41,340 --> 00:39:42,740
- Shall we start? / - What should I start with?

914
00:39:42,740 --> 00:39:45,007
Do I start with the pizza or the pasta?

915
00:39:45,307 --> 00:39:47,607
This is interesting. It's like noodles.

916
00:39:47,607 --> 00:39:48,707
It's Filipino style.

917
00:39:48,707 --> 00:39:50,907
- Isn't it like stir-fried noodles? / - Yeah.

918
00:39:50,907 --> 00:39:52,273

- Everything was delicious. / - Everything is good.

921
00:39:57,573 --> 00:39:59,340
After swimming, everything tastes good.

922
00:39:59,340 --> 00:40:01,340
It was only $4.40.

923
00:40:03,407 --> 00:40:06,740
It's like a fusion fried noodle dish.

924
00:40:06,740 --> 00:40:10,840
It's not typical Italian pasta.

925
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:14,273
- It was a bit like Chinese food. / - Chinese noodles?

926
00:40:14,273 --> 00:40:16,340
(It's similar to South East Asian fried noodles)

927
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:21,207
Why do they play Sookyung's footage in slow motion?

928
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:24,207
- Do it to Nami's footage as well. / - What about me?

929
00:40:24,207 --> 00:40:27,040
- Sookyung was just moving slowly. / - Really?

930
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:28,740
Sookyung just moved slowly herself.

931
00:40:31,273 --> 00:40:32,773
- This isn't played in slow motion. / - Let me see.

932
00:40:33,107 --> 00:40:35,307
- Mine is just crunch. / - Listen to that sound.

933
00:40:35,307 --> 00:40:38,073
- So great. / - The sound was so crunchy.

934
00:40:39,140 --> 00:40:41,707
I think they make the dough and bake it here.

935
00:40:41,707 --> 00:40:43,707
- It's really thin. / - It's very thin.

936
00:40:44,207 --> 00:40:47,140
- It's crunchy. / - It almost looks like chips.

937
00:40:47,140 --> 00:40:50,307
- It was so crunchy. / - This is unique.

938
00:40:50,307 --> 00:40:53,040
- I like it. / - The dough is very thin.

939
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:54,573
It was crispy like chips.

940
00:40:54,573 --> 00:40:57,740
(They enjoy their last meal in Oslob)

941
00:41:01,473 --> 00:41:02,807
It's again played in slow motion.

942
00:41:02,807 --> 00:41:05,607
- It's played in slow motion again. / - This is unfair.

943
00:41:05,607 --> 00:41:07,440
Even her eating scene is in slow motion.

944
00:41:08,507 --> 00:41:11,107
(We prepared Nami's slow motion video as well)

945
00:41:11,807 --> 00:41:14,640
(Shampooing Nami, good to save on your computer)

946
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:18,140
(The night falls in Oslob)

947
00:41:18,140 --> 00:41:20,807
- It's so beautiful. / - It is, isn't it?

948
00:41:20,807 --> 00:41:21,907
It's really nice here.

949
00:41:21,907 --> 00:41:24,407
Of the 52 hours of our tour...

950
00:41:24,407 --> 00:41:27,140
- Already half has passed. / - It's so sad.

951
00:41:27,140 --> 00:41:30,373
Is it? The tour is already half-over.

952
00:41:30,373 --> 00:41:33,273
I just blinked my eyes three times

953
00:41:33,273 --> 00:41:34,973
and it's half-over.

954
00:41:35,507 --> 00:41:38,107
- We had too much fun. / - Did we?

955
00:41:38,673 --> 00:41:43,673
Today, we enjoyed the nature in Oslob.

956
00:41:43,673 --> 00:41:45,740
- Right? / - Yes.

957
00:41:45,740 --> 00:41:47,907
Tomorrow, we're going to Cebu City.

958
00:41:48,140 --> 00:41:50,107
We'll do things we can enjoy in a city.

959
00:41:50,707 --> 00:41:52,907
So today's tour was about the nature.

960
00:41:52,907 --> 00:41:55,140
- And tomorrow's is about city. / - It's a city tour.

961
00:41:55,140 --> 00:41:56,640
(Day 2 is a city tour)

962
00:41:57,007 --> 00:41:58,940
We should have fun tomorrow as well.

963
00:41:59,207 --> 00:42:00,773
I'd like to propose a toast.

964
00:42:00,773 --> 00:42:03,407
- Cheers to tomorrow. / - Cheers to tomorrow.

965
00:42:05,140 --> 00:42:07,007

966

- Before this is aired. / - Raeyeon is so going there.

967
00:42:09,540 --> 00:42:10,707
She's convinced.

968
00:42:10,707 --> 00:42:12,973
She's flying tonight.

969
00:42:12,973 --> 00:42:14,407
I'd like to pack my bag already.

970
00:42:14,540 --> 00:42:18,840
(Their exciting day is over)

971
00:42:20,673 --> 00:42:22,907
(They enjoyed nature)

972
00:42:22,907 --> 00:42:24,307
It's so cute.

973
00:42:24,307 --> 00:42:25,507
- It's really cute. / - It's so nice here.

974
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:28,173
- We went to Cebu City. / - Cebu City.

975
00:42:28,173 --> 00:42:30,340
You can experience two different places at once.

976
00:42:30,340 --> 00:42:31,373
(It's new)

977
00:42:31,373 --> 00:42:33,740
(It's a new way to enjoy the city view)

978
00:42:34,340 --> 00:42:36,707
- Is that a ride? / - Let's not do that.

979
00:42:36,707 --> 00:42:37,740
(There are endless variety of things)

980
00:42:37,740 --> 00:42:39,273
I want to take this back to Korea.

981
00:42:41,873 --> 00:42:44,640
(It's a feast of delicious foods)

982
00:42:46,173 --> 00:42:48,373
- I can eat this the whole day. / - The food looks good.

983
00:42:48,373 --> 00:42:49,440
I will never get sick of it.

984
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:51,073
- That was so delicious. / - It's so good.

985
00:42:51,773 --> 00:42:53,540
It's a good thing we came here.

986
00:42:53,540 --> 00:42:55,573
What is the thing you were eating, Nami?

987
00:42:55,573 --> 00:42:57,840
- It's a jaw. / - It's a jaw?

988
00:42:59,140 --> 00:43:00,407
You ate a whale shark?

989
00:43:00,540 --> 00:43:02,440
- Come on. / - No.

990
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:04,173
I tried my best to diss them.

991
00:43:04,573 --> 00:43:06,373
- It's been okay so far. / - It's so nice.

992
00:43:06,373 --> 00:43:08,940
It's really nice, isn't it?

993
00:43:09,507 --> 00:43:13,340
(Hour 16 of the 52 Tour)

994
00:43:16,740 --> 00:43:18,673

995
00:43:18,673 --> 00:43:20,040
- Yes, we did. / - They're excited again.

996
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:23,273
Since we're in a city,

997
00:43:23,273 --> 00:43:24,807
it feels somewhat different.

998
00:43:24,807 --> 00:43:26,440
- Right? / - It does.

999
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:28,240
(Cebu City gives off a different vibe from yesterday)

1000
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:31,007
Cebu City is really developed.

1001
00:43:32,140 --> 00:43:33,907
It's been over 10 years since I was there.

1002
00:43:33,907 --> 00:43:36,373
Really? It's totally different now.

1003
00:43:36,373 --> 00:43:37,473
Wow.

1004
00:43:37,473 --> 00:43:39,607
There weren't many skyscrapers back then.

1005
00:43:39,607 --> 00:43:43,707
- Nami, we're in Cebu City. / - Yes.

1006
00:43:43,707 --> 00:43:46,173
Where is our first spot?

1007
00:43:46,173 --> 00:43:47,940
As you know, the first spot is important.

1008
00:43:47,940 --> 00:43:49,740
- A good start is important. / - It was good yesterday.

1009
00:43:49,740 --> 00:43:52,073
- It was amazing. / - Right? Today...

1010
00:43:52,073 --> 00:43:55,273
We love fruits.

1011
00:43:55,707 --> 00:43:57,807
We're going to start the day with some fruits.

1012
00:43:59,540 --> 00:44:02,207
I was wondering what that was.

1013
00:44:02,207 --> 00:44:03,473
It's a cool bag.

1014
00:44:03,473 --> 00:44:04,973
You must eat fruits in those countries.

1015
00:44:04,973 --> 00:44:07,007
- You must. / - They have tasty fruits.

1016
00:44:07,007 --> 00:44:10,107
Fruits in the Philippines are very delicious.

1017
00:44:10,107 --> 00:44:13,673
- They're very sweet. / - They're incredibly sweet.

1018
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:16,807
(Ramos Fruit market)

1019
00:44:16,807 --> 00:44:19,807
This market is called Ramos.

1020
00:44:19,973 --> 00:44:21,907
It's like Yeongdeungpo Fruit Market.

1021
00:44:22,407 --> 00:44:24,273
It's a fruit market.

1022
00:44:24,273 --> 00:44:26,073
We can pick whichever fruit we like.

1023
00:44:28,773 --> 00:44:31,607
- I like that one. / - It's good. It looks like a potato.

Tropical fruits are so delicious.

1027
00:44:39,007 --> 00:44:42,640
It's usually not easy for foreigners to shop in Cebu,

1028
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:44,940
but I highly recommend this place.

1029
00:44:44,940 --> 00:44:46,840
A lot of fruit stands are there in a row.

1030
00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:49,973
Aren't the pineapples so cute?

1031
00:44:49,973 --> 00:44:51,507
This pineapple looks like a toy.

1032
00:44:51,507 --> 00:44:54,540
Right? They look like toys.

1033
00:44:54,540 --> 00:44:56,740
This one looks so delicious. It's a gold pineapple.

1034
00:44:56,740 --> 00:44:58,607
Shall we try some pineapples?

1035
00:44:58,607 --> 00:45:00,773
- Let's do that. / - It looks so sweet.

1036
00:45:00,773 --> 00:45:03,207
Excuse me. How much is it?

- 70. / - 70?

1038
00:45:06,507 --> 00:45:08,107
- Slice? / - Yes, slice.

1039
00:45:08,107 --> 00:45:09,507
You must eat many fruits there.

1040
00:45:09,507 --> 00:45:10,773
I thought it was on a tree.

1041
00:45:10,773 --> 00:45:12,840
Me too. I thought they were growing it here.

1042
00:45:14,707 --> 00:45:15,940
She cuts it right here.

1043
00:45:16,573 --> 00:45:18,740
- She looks so experienced. / - She does.

1044
00:45:18,740 --> 00:45:20,640
She cuts the pineapple for you right in front of you.

1045
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:22,073
- The pineapple? / - Yes.

1046
00:45:22,740 --> 00:45:24,340
- This is fascinating. / - She's so cool, isn't she?

1047
00:45:24,340 --> 00:45:26,640
Sookyung, everything is fascinating, right?

1048
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:27,907
To her, everything is new.

1049
00:45:27,907 --> 00:45:30,440
I was so happy. I liked everything.

1050
00:45:31,340 --> 00:45:34,140
(The gold pineapple reveals its yellow flesh)

1051
00:45:34,140 --> 00:45:35,773
It's so fresh.

1052
00:45:35,773 --> 00:45:37,107
It's indeed fresh.

1053
00:45:37,807 --> 00:45:39,540
(After peeling the skin, she carefully cuts out the rest)

1054
00:45:39,540 --> 00:45:41,940
It's interesting. They usually cut the middle part first,

1055
00:45:41,940 --> 00:45:43,840
but she peels the skin first.

1056
00:45:43,840 --> 00:45:45,340
She peels it as if she peels an apple.

1057
00:45:46,207 --> 00:45:49,073
By the way, if she keeps cutting it like this,

1058
00:45:49,073 --> 00:45:50,673
we might have only the core in the end.

1059
00:45:52,373 --> 00:45:54,640
- She's cutting out too much. / - No, she's an expert.

1060
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:56,640
- Let her take care of it. / - Okay.

1061
00:45:58,740 --> 00:46:00,040
- Yes. / - It's done.

1062
00:46:00,040 --> 00:46:01,973
(The gold pineapple is ready to be eaten)

1063
00:46:03,307 --> 00:46:04,540
You can just eat it like that?

1064
00:46:04,540 --> 00:46:05,973
- Yes. / - How did she do that?

1065
00:46:05,973 --> 00:46:07,873
Can we eat the core of the pineapple?

1066
00:46:07,873 --> 00:46:10,840
The pineapple is so small that its core is very soft.

1067
00:46:10,840 --> 00:46:12,240
You can eat it as well.

1068
00:46:12,607 --> 00:46:14,907
- You can eat the core of it? / - She cut the cores.

1069
00:46:14,907 --> 00:46:16,840
(As soon as they got it, they try it)

1070
00:46:17,940 --> 00:46:19,707
- How is it? / - It's so good.

1071
00:46:21,140 --> 00:46:23,773
The core is usually too hard to eat,

1072
00:46:23,773 --> 00:46:25,673
but you can eat the core too.

1073
00:46:25,673 --> 00:46:26,840
(The core of gold pineapples is soft)

1074
00:46:27,173 --> 00:46:29,540
I've never seen a pineapple you can eat the core.

1075
00:46:29,540 --> 00:46:31,040
It feels like eating an ice cream.

1076
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:32,573
- Pineapple ice cream. / - Pineapple ice cream.

1077
00:46:32,573 --> 00:46:33,607
It's so soft.

1078
00:46:34,273 --> 00:46:35,340
I love it.

1079
00:46:35,907 --> 00:46:38,340
- I'm curious about one fruit. / - What is it?

1080
00:46:38,340 --> 00:46:40,440
This. What is it?

1081
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:43,173
- Santol. / - Santol?

1082
00:46:43,807 --> 00:46:45,973
- Let's try one. / - Shall we try one?

1083
00:46:45,973 --> 00:46:48,040
One, slice.

1084
00:46:48,373 --> 00:46:50,707
It looks hard. Maybe the knife is sharp.

1085
00:46:50,707 --> 00:46:52,040
I think the knife is sharp.

1086
00:46:52,973 --> 00:46:55,073
- It looks interesting inside. / - What is that?

1087
00:46:55,073 --> 00:46:56,440
- What is it? / - Something is inside.

1088
00:46:56,440 --> 00:46:58,207
You're supposed to eat what's inside.

1089
00:46:58,340 --> 00:46:59,473
What is that?

1090
00:46:59,807 --> 00:47:01,607
- What is that? / - How does it taste?

1091
00:47:01,607 --> 00:47:03,773
(How does it taste?)

1092
00:47:03,773 --> 00:47:05,440
(It's sour)

1093
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:07,240
Is there fiber in it?

1094
00:47:07,640 --> 00:47:10,907
The whole fruit is big, but the flesh is so little.

1095
00:47:10,907 --> 00:47:12,440
- There's a seed as well. / - Its seed is also big.

1096
00:47:12,440 --> 00:47:14,573
It has a big seed? So there is little flesh.

1097
00:47:14,573 --> 00:47:16,507
It tastes like apricots and lychees.

1098
00:47:17,840 --> 00:47:19,407
(This is the flesh you can eat)

1099
00:47:20,273 --> 00:47:22,407
(Nami is interested in santol)

1100
00:47:23,707 --> 00:47:27,307
(Can I eat this?)

1101
00:47:27,307 --> 00:47:28,340
It's...

1102
00:47:29,673 --> 00:47:30,773
It's like a plum.

1103
00:47:32,273 --> 00:47:33,340
What did you eat?

1104
00:47:33,340 --> 00:47:36,407
- It was so bitter. / - It smells like a plum.

1105
00:47:36,407 --> 00:47:38,607
- Yes, it does. / - You're not supposed to eat it.

1106
00:47:38,607 --> 00:47:40,907
- The color is so pretty. / - Shouldn't eat that.

1107
00:47:41,707 --> 00:47:44,673
It's nice to have fresh fruits in the morning.

1108
00:47:44,673 --> 00:47:46,473
- They're delicious. / - I've never tried this before.

1109
00:47:46,473 --> 00:47:48,440
- It refreshes my mouth. / - It does.

1110
00:47:48,440 --> 00:47:50,807
- It feels refreshing. / - It was refreshing until...

1111
00:47:50,807 --> 00:47:52,640
I tried the skin.

1112
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:54,640
It's bitter. I think I should eat something else.

1113
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:56,007
Let's go eat something else.

1114
00:47:57,007 --> 00:48:00,340
Nami, we're in Southeast Asia.

1115
00:48:00,340 --> 00:48:02,707
We have to try the king of tropical fruits.

1116
00:48:02,707 --> 00:48:04,140
- Durian? / - Durian.

1117
00:48:04,140 --> 00:48:05,973
- Durian. / - I like Durians.

1118
00:48:05,973 --> 00:48:07,940
- Durians are good. / - You have to pick a good one.

1119
00:48:07,940 --> 00:48:10,473
- Durians have a strong smell. / - It's tasty, isn't it?

1120
00:48:10,473 --> 00:48:12,440
- No. / - Durians are...

1121
00:48:15,407 --> 00:48:18,307
(He tried a durian on his tour)

1122
00:48:22,507 --> 00:48:23,840
(They can't miss)

1123
00:48:23,840 --> 00:48:25,540
(The king of the fruits)

1124
00:48:26,073 --> 00:48:27,840
(It looks unfamiliar)

1125
00:48:29,940 --> 00:48:31,573
You'll start smelling it now.

1126
00:48:31,573 --> 00:48:35,340
(But it looks cute inside)

1127
00:48:36,007 --> 00:48:39,373
(Their first encounter with a durian)

1128
00:48:39,373 --> 00:48:40,873
(Sniffing)

1129
00:48:40,873 --> 00:48:41,707
The smell...

1130
00:48:41,707 --> 00:48:42,940
You have to eat it together with someone.

1131
00:48:42,940 --> 00:48:45,373
- You have to chew it. / - You shouldn't eat that alone.

1132
00:48:45,373 --> 00:48:47,207
It's delicious. It's really delicious.

1133
00:48:47,207 --> 00:48:48,307
What happened to Sookyung?

1134
00:48:48,307 --> 00:48:50,473
- I love durians. / - Durians are very delicious.

1135
00:48:50,473 --> 00:48:53,173
If you like durians, you should travel more.

1136
00:48:53,173 --> 00:48:54,107
- It's so ripe. / - I'm going to travel more.

1137
00:48:54,107 --> 00:48:56,007
Southeast Asia is a big place.

1138
00:48:56,673 --> 00:48:57,773
How does it taste?

1139
00:48:58,573 --> 00:49:01,340
It smells very uninviting at first.

1140
00:49:01,340 --> 00:49:02,807
(It's soft like avocados, and it melts in your mouth)

1141
00:49:02,807 --> 00:49:06,107
Its texture is like that of a ripe avocado.

1142
00:49:07,340 --> 00:49:08,573
Why am I sweating so much?

1143
00:49:09,307 --> 00:49:11,440
- I accepted the challenge. / - It was Nami's first time.

1144
00:49:11,840 --> 00:49:13,673
It tastes like it might not be completely ripe.

1145
00:49:14,307 --> 00:49:17,273
(She's hesitant)

1146
00:49:20,807 --> 00:49:22,573
Chew it.

1147
00:49:22,673 --> 00:49:24,173
(Her face tells how it tastes)

1148
00:49:24,173 --> 00:49:25,740
- Why? / - Hang on.

1149
00:49:25,740 --> 00:49:28,573
You can't help but react like that at first bite.

1150
00:49:28,573 --> 00:49:30,207
- If you're trying it for the first time... / - It was good.

1151
00:49:30,207 --> 00:49:32,973
I always say they should try three bites.

1152
00:49:32,973 --> 00:49:34,507
- You should try 3 bites. / - You should keep eating.

1153
00:49:34,507 --> 00:49:35,673
She's right.

1154
00:49:36,573 --> 00:49:38,173
(She takes another bite)

1155
00:49:38,173 --> 00:49:39,407
It's tasty.

1156
00:49:41,240 --> 00:49:43,407
- It's interesting. / - It's tasty, isn't it?

1157
00:49:43,573 --> 00:49:44,807
- It's really delicious. / - At first...

1158
00:49:45,007 --> 00:49:46,540
I almost threw up.

1159
00:49:47,273 --> 00:49:48,673
I'm not kidding.

1160
00:49:49,807 --> 00:49:52,607
Since you were enjoying it so much,

1161
00:49:52,607 --> 00:49:54,273
I had another bite.

1162
00:49:54,273 --> 00:49:56,140
- It's sweet. / - It's really sweet, right?

1163
00:49:56,140 --> 00:49:59,940
My body absorbed this smell.

1164
00:50:00,640 --> 00:50:02,740
Once you manage the first bite, it's good.

1165
00:50:03,373 --> 00:50:05,207
Why are you sweating so much?

1166
00:50:05,507 --> 00:50:07,307
After you eat that, you smell durian in your nose.

1167
00:50:07,307 --> 00:50:09,607
- I know. / - You keep smelling it.

1168
00:50:09,607 --> 00:50:11,407
- You keep smelling it. / - I keep smelling it.

1169
00:50:12,040 --> 00:50:13,407
We just tried a durian.

1170
00:50:13,407 --> 00:50:15,407
Now, let's eat the mangosteens that you like.

1171
00:50:15,407 --> 00:50:16,440
Okay.

1172
00:50:16,440 --> 00:50:17,440
(1kg of mangosteens, $8.40)

1173
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:19,040
- It's delicious. / - Is it good?

1174
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:22,407
- Have you tried this? / - Yes, I like this too.

1175
00:50:22,707 --> 00:50:23,907
I have never seen this.

1176
00:50:23,907 --> 00:50:25,307
This is delicious.

1177
00:50:25,307 --> 00:50:27,640
- You peel the skin and eat it. / - It's very delicious.

1178
00:50:27,640 --> 00:50:28,640
This one is very delicious.

1179
00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:29,740
I love this.

1180
00:50:29,740 --> 00:50:31,840
You can't stop eating it once you start, like peanuts.

1181
00:50:31,840 --> 00:50:33,307
- Have you tried this? / - Yes.

1182
00:50:33,573 --> 00:50:34,973
I like this one too.

1183
00:50:34,973 --> 00:50:36,773
I've never seen this.

1184
00:50:36,973 --> 00:50:39,307
- Let's take some. / - Shall we put some in the bag?

1185
00:50:39,573 --> 00:50:42,507
It must be very sweet. It made my hands...

1186
00:50:42,507 --> 00:50:44,107
- Sticky, right? / - It's so sticky.

1187
00:50:44,407 --> 00:50:47,407
Nami, now we had fruits...

1188
00:50:47,407 --> 00:50:49,440
- Sookyung. / - Are we going to walk around?

1189
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:51,707
We're not walking around. Now we had fruits,

1190
00:50:51,707 --> 00:50:53,573
we have to go have an even more delicious meal.

1191
00:50:53,873 --> 00:50:56,207
We haven't tried seafood yet.

1192
00:50:56,207 --> 00:50:58,007
You're right. We're in an island.

1193
00:50:58,007 --> 00:50:59,807
Do you know what's important?

1194
00:50:59,807 --> 00:51:01,873
We're going to a restaurant that was never

1195
00:51:01,873 --> 00:51:04,740
on this show nor any other show.

1196
00:51:06,040 --> 00:51:08,040
- What is this? Is it seafood? / - Yes.

1197
00:51:08,340 --> 00:51:10,607
- It looks like meat. / - Is that a tuna?

1198
00:51:10,807 --> 00:51:12,473
- Is this the jaw? / - It looks like a tuna.

1199
00:51:12,473 --> 00:51:14,240
- It's a tuna, isn't it? / - That's correct.

1200
00:51:14,473 --> 00:51:15,640
That's correct.

1201
00:51:15,807 --> 00:51:17,707
- It's a tuna. / - It's a tuna.

1202
00:51:17,707 --> 00:51:19,740
It looks like beef ribs.

1203
00:51:19,740 --> 00:51:21,073
(Conquering the city of Cebu)

1204
00:51:21,073 --> 00:51:24,773
(A seafood dish that has never been on Battle Trip)

1205
00:51:24,773 --> 00:51:27,540
Sookyung, we're soon going to eat.

1206
00:51:27,607 --> 00:51:29,507
As long as you travel in the city,

1207
00:51:29,507 --> 00:51:31,573
I heard the taxies are cheap. Should we take a taxi?

1208
00:51:32,273 --> 00:51:34,540
Is it okay with you? Okay. Then let's take a taxi.

1209
00:51:34,540 --> 00:51:35,540
Taxi.

1210
00:51:37,140 --> 00:51:39,273
She calls a taxi as if she's a local.

1211
00:51:39,273 --> 00:51:41,573
- It looked so natural. / - She called a taxi.

1212
00:51:41,573 --> 00:51:42,873
- Taxi. / - Taxi.

1213
00:51:45,973 --> 00:51:49,807
(Basic cab fare, 84 cents)

1214
00:51:50,007 --> 00:51:52,940
You wanted to ride a jeepney, right?

1215
00:51:52,940 --> 00:51:54,140
- Yes, a jeepney. / - Yes.

1216
00:51:54,140 --> 00:51:56,373
But that's a little dangerous

1217
00:51:56,373 --> 00:51:58,473
and there are pickpocket problems.

1218
00:51:58,473 --> 00:52:00,007
- Really? Inside there? / - Yes.

1219
00:52:00,007 --> 00:52:02,207
- This is safer than a jeepney then. / - Yes, it's safer.

1220
00:52:02,207 --> 00:52:03,940
- And it's cheap. / - Yes?

1221
00:52:04,140 --> 00:52:05,340
It's cheaper than Korea.

1222
00:52:05,340 --> 00:52:07,307
This is more cost-effective when traveling in a group.

1223
00:52:07,307 --> 00:52:08,740
- It's cheaper. / - That's right.

1224
00:52:08,740 --> 00:52:10,273
- It's also hot. / - Yes.

1225
00:52:13,007 --> 00:52:14,607
- Isn't it so different? / - That's right.

1226
00:52:14,607 --> 00:52:16,907
It was all nature yesterday. Today it's city.

1227
00:52:16,907 --> 00:52:18,073
Cebu didn't have that many

1228
00:52:18,073 --> 00:52:19,340
high buildings 10 years ago.

1229
00:52:19,340 --> 00:52:21,507
- Yes, it was more... / - That's right.

1230
00:52:21,507 --> 00:52:23,207
- Natural-friendly. / - Many high buildings were built.

1231
00:52:23,207 --> 00:52:26,140
(You can enjoy various sides of Cebu in a short time)

1232
00:52:30,673 --> 00:52:35,440
(15 minutes by car to the seafood restaurant)

1233
00:52:35,773 --> 00:52:37,807
- Are we there? / - Yes, we arrived.

1234
00:52:37,807 --> 00:52:39,273
How much is 240 pesos?

1235
00:52:40,040 --> 00:52:43,207
It didn't even cost us $5 to come here.

1236
00:52:43,207 --> 00:52:44,807
- We came a long way. / - Yes.

1237
00:52:45,807 --> 00:52:47,673
- Thank you. / - Thank you.

1238
00:52:48,873 --> 00:52:51,840
People are all moving busily.

1239
00:52:51,840 --> 00:52:53,140
I'm looking forward to it even more.

1240
00:52:53,140 --> 00:52:56,307
Look, there are a lot of locals.

1241
00:52:56,307 --> 00:52:57,740
(Nami picked a perfect local restaurant)

1242
00:52:58,473 --> 00:53:00,207
It's a popular place among locals.

1243
00:53:00,907 --> 00:53:03,673
- You must go to places like that. / - A family restaurant.

1244
00:53:03,673 --> 00:53:06,873
There were a lot of families. Like a family restaurant.

1245
00:53:06,873 --> 00:53:08,340
Let's order first.

1246
00:53:08,340 --> 00:53:10,240
Should we? I've been talking too much, right?

1247
00:53:10,607 --> 00:53:12,073
Excuse me?

1248
00:53:12,073 --> 00:53:14,240
Nami does everything.

1249
00:53:14,240 --> 00:53:15,507
Right.

1250
00:53:15,807 --> 00:53:17,773
- It's good. There are pictures. / - Yes, pictures.

1251
00:53:17,773 --> 00:53:18,940
I need pictures.

1252
00:53:18,940 --> 00:53:20,040
There's tuna.

1253
00:53:20,073 --> 00:53:21,907
- Fish... / - Yes.

1254
00:53:22,073 --> 00:53:23,473
- Fish? / - Yes, fish.

1255
00:53:24,007 --> 00:53:25,173
Fish?

1256
00:53:25,673 --> 00:53:26,940
That looks good.

1257
00:53:27,873 --> 00:53:29,107
- Is this alimango? / - Yes.

1258
00:53:29,840 --> 00:53:32,473
- Gosh. / - That looks really good.

1259
00:53:32,640 --> 00:53:33,707
Rice.

1260
00:53:33,707 --> 00:53:36,173
- Can I order a drink? / - Okay.

1261
00:53:38,073 --> 00:53:39,440
Nami is perfect.

1262
00:53:39,673 --> 00:53:40,807
Wow.

1263
00:53:40,807 --> 00:53:42,073
Panga.

1264
00:53:42,073 --> 00:53:43,407
It looks like pork ribs.

1265
00:53:44,873 --> 00:53:46,440
(She's carrying a tray full of food)

1266
00:53:47,473 --> 00:53:50,107
(It looks plentiful even at a glance)

1267
00:53:52,340 --> 00:53:54,373
(The seafood dishes of the 52 Tour)

1268
00:53:54,373 --> 00:53:55,407
I'm hungry.

1269
00:53:56,907 --> 00:53:59,207
- Wow. / - It must be a really big tuna.

1270
00:54:03,073 --> 00:54:04,840
It took a little long.

1271
00:54:04,840 --> 00:54:07,907
- They grilled everything. / - That looks so good.

1272
00:54:07,907 --> 00:54:11,173
Grilled tuna chin and alimango are both

1273
00:54:11,173 --> 00:54:12,773
rare in the Philippines.

1274
00:54:12,773 --> 00:54:14,640
If you go to a seafood restaurant,

1275
00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:16,340
you have to check the menu first.

1276
00:54:16,340 --> 00:54:17,940
- To see if they have it or not? / - Yes.

1277
00:54:18,407 --> 00:54:20,307
I've never had grilled tuna jaw yet.

1278
00:54:20,307 --> 00:54:22,007
- It was also my first time. / - I've never had it.

1279
00:54:22,007 --> 00:54:24,473
- It looks like meat. / - I was curious at first.

1280
00:54:24,740 --> 00:54:26,173
(Is this dish tuna jaw?)

1281
00:54:26,173 --> 00:54:27,240
- Doesn't it? / - I'm curious.

1282
00:54:27,240 --> 00:54:28,340
Wow, that's...

1283
00:54:28,507 --> 00:54:30,707
- I've never seen anything like this. / - That's right.

1284
00:54:30,707 --> 00:54:32,773
- They didn't have to do that. / - That's too much.

1285
00:54:32,773 --> 00:54:34,840
- That's cruel. / - That's so cruel.

1286
00:54:34,940 --> 00:54:36,140
Look at all that flesh.

1287
00:54:36,140 --> 00:54:38,540
(The grilled jaw is cut so tenderly)

1288
00:54:38,673 --> 00:54:40,907
- It looks like pork ribs. / - That's right.

1289
00:54:40,907 --> 00:54:42,907
- That's right. / - At a glance...

1290
00:54:42,907 --> 00:54:44,240
- It looks like pork. / - It looked undercooked.

1291
00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:45,307
- Isn't that right? / - Yes.

1292
00:54:46,240 --> 00:54:48,673
- We waited for a long time. / - Waited for a long time.

1293
00:54:48,673 --> 00:54:50,407
(What does the grilled tuna jaw taste like?)

1294
00:54:52,840 --> 00:54:55,873
It tastes a little like Okhotsk atka mackerel.

1295
00:54:55,873 --> 00:54:57,373
(Nami appreciates the scent first)

1296
00:55:01,673 --> 00:55:04,640
The flesh isn't flaky.

1297
00:55:04,740 --> 00:55:07,807
- The flesh is chewy. / - Yes, it's chewy.

1298
00:55:07,807 --> 00:55:09,073
- It doesn't seem like fish. / - Right.

1299
00:55:09,073 --> 00:55:10,340
Should we spray some of this on?

1300
00:55:11,273 --> 00:55:14,140
The scent will change if we spray this on.

1301
00:55:14,140 --> 00:55:15,807
The scent is so nice.

1302
00:55:16,907 --> 00:55:19,573
- I've only had that as drinks. / - Sprinkle that on.

1303
00:55:19,573 --> 00:55:20,673
It looks so good.

1304
00:55:20,673 --> 00:55:22,373
- We ate it plain at first. / - We sprinkled it ourselves.

1305
00:55:22,373 --> 00:55:25,040
It tastes a little different with the calamansi.

1306
00:55:25,040 --> 00:55:27,407
- The last taste would be fresh. / - It's really fresh.

1307
00:55:27,407 --> 00:55:29,340
When you go to the Philippines

1308
00:55:29,340 --> 00:55:30,973
and put calamansi in soju,

1309
00:55:30,973 --> 00:55:32,007
it tastes really good.

1310
00:55:32,007 --> 00:55:33,640
- That's the trend these days. / - It's like a cocktail.

1311
00:55:34,040 --> 00:55:36,940
(How is grilled tuna jaw with calamansi?)

1312
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:43,507
- It has a particular scent. / - Yes.

1313
00:55:43,807 --> 00:55:46,407
But the scent changes...

1314
00:55:47,507 --> 00:55:48,740
When you squeeze the calamansi on.

1315
00:55:48,740 --> 00:55:52,807
- The tangy and sweet scent... / - Really?

1316
00:55:53,073 --> 00:55:54,907
- Makes it more flavorful. / - That's right.

1317
00:55:55,273 --> 00:55:56,873
I love it with calamansi.

1318
00:55:57,040 --> 00:55:57,907
(She squeezes calamansi without hesitation)

1319
00:55:57,907 --> 00:55:59,240
Add some more.

1320
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:00,707
Why is it so sweet?

1321
00:56:00,707 --> 00:56:02,140
(Greatly satisfied)

1322
00:56:02,140 --> 00:56:05,307
They must have made a sauce that goes well...

1323
00:56:05,307 --> 00:56:07,373
- With the tuna. / - You're right.

1324
00:56:07,373 --> 00:56:09,773
- Koreans will love this taste. / - Yes.

1325
00:56:11,707 --> 00:56:13,207
You wouldn't know it was tuna jaw

1326
00:56:13,207 --> 00:56:14,807
if no one tells you about it.

1327
00:56:14,807 --> 00:56:17,173
Right? It's grilled tuna jaw.

1328
00:56:17,173 --> 00:56:19,840
It's called panga in the Philippines.

1329
00:56:19,940 --> 00:56:21,907
- Panga? / - Panga.

1330
00:56:23,607 --> 00:56:25,140
(The huge grilled tuna jaw isn't getting any smaller)

1331
00:56:25,140 --> 00:56:26,373
Why does it have so much flesh?

1332
00:56:26,373 --> 00:56:27,473
It's really big.

1333
00:56:27,473 --> 00:56:29,640
No matter how much we eat, it won't end.

1334
00:56:31,540 --> 00:56:33,007
- It has a lot of flesh. / - I want to eat it.

1335
00:56:33,007 --> 00:56:34,673
It has a lot of flesh. It must've been a big tuna.

1336
00:56:34,673 --> 00:56:35,973
That must be really good.

1337
00:56:36,773 --> 00:56:39,007
- That's a lot. / - It's like soy braised beef.

1338
00:56:39,007 --> 00:56:42,240
I think it will taste good with a little horseradish.

1339
00:56:42,240 --> 00:56:43,807
But here,

1340
00:56:43,807 --> 00:56:46,173
we'll eat it with calamansi.

1341
00:56:46,173 --> 00:56:48,473
(We strongly recommend it with calamansi)

1342
00:56:51,107 --> 00:56:53,473
(They fall in love because of the novelty)

1343
00:56:53,473 --> 00:56:56,407
(And because of the wonderful taste)

1344
00:56:56,407 --> 00:56:57,740
It's so good.

1345
00:56:57,940 --> 00:57:00,073
(Grilled tuna jaw! Panga!)

1346
00:57:01,573 --> 00:57:03,540
- The amount is plentiful also. / - Yes.

1347
00:57:04,773 --> 00:57:06,007
It's like a festival.

1348
00:57:07,640 --> 00:57:09,107
I'm also going to try the other food.

1349
00:57:10,207 --> 00:57:11,507
- I'm going to eat the crab. / - The crab?

1350
00:57:11,607 --> 00:57:13,873
(Alimango with chili sauce)

1351
00:57:15,173 --> 00:57:17,140
- It's a Filipino-style crab dish. / - Yes.

1352
00:57:17,140 --> 00:57:18,407
(Alimango with chili, $23.80)

1353
00:57:19,207 --> 00:57:20,807
I'm going to try the sauce first.

1354
00:57:20,807 --> 00:57:22,973
(The sauce that determines the taste of the dish)

1355
00:57:25,940 --> 00:57:27,540
- How is it? / - You have to mix it with rice.

1356
00:57:27,540 --> 00:57:28,707
- You need rice? / - Yes.

1357
00:57:29,840 --> 00:57:31,407
Is it a little spicy?

1358
00:57:31,407 --> 00:57:32,440
(Nami also tries a bite)

1359
00:57:33,540 --> 00:57:36,040
(She finally tries the crab meat)

1360
00:57:38,340 --> 00:57:40,373
- The meat is really good. / - Yes.

1361
00:57:40,373 --> 00:57:41,707
You're really picky when it comes to food.

1362
00:57:43,873 --> 00:57:44,973
- Is it good? / - Yes.

1363
00:57:44,973 --> 00:57:47,140
I can't drink alcohol but I wanted to drink

1364
00:57:47,140 --> 00:57:48,240
because it was so delicious.

1365
00:57:48,240 --> 00:57:50,207
Sookyung taught Nami how to drink,

1366
00:57:50,207 --> 00:57:51,707
and Nami taught Sookyung how to travel.

1367
00:57:51,707 --> 00:57:53,007
- That's right. / - That's right.

1368
00:57:53,007 --> 00:57:54,040
It's the best.

1369
00:57:57,307 --> 00:58:01,207
(Crabs taste the best when you eat with your hands)

1370
00:58:01,207 --> 00:58:06,007
You can eat the crab as a whole with Thai crab curry.

1371
00:58:06,007 --> 00:58:08,507
- But this one tastes stronger. / - Right.

1372
00:58:08,507 --> 00:58:09,973
Crabs in Thailand are softer

1373
00:58:09,973 --> 00:58:11,307
and they feel somewhat feminine.

1374
00:58:11,307 --> 00:58:12,773
This one, on the other hand,

1375
00:58:12,773 --> 00:58:14,040
tastes strong and passionate.

1376
00:58:14,040 --> 00:58:15,207
- That's right. / - Yes.

1377
00:58:16,507 --> 00:58:17,673
(Ah)

1378
00:58:18,207 --> 00:58:19,373
Ah.

1379
00:58:19,707 --> 00:58:23,340
(The young Nami is taking good care of her sister)

1380
00:58:25,140 --> 00:58:27,207
That looks good. It's good if you mix it with rice.

1381
00:58:27,307 --> 00:58:28,407
Seriously.

1382
00:58:29,273 --> 00:58:30,973
- Nami is doing good. / - Seriously.

1383
00:58:31,373 --> 00:58:33,607
- It's like marinated crabs. / - I've been to Yeosu.

1384
00:58:33,607 --> 00:58:35,140
- She eats it like marinated crabs. / - Yes.

1385
00:58:37,307 --> 00:58:39,807
(You can't eat crabs without eating rice in the shell)

1386
00:58:39,807 --> 00:58:41,373
It's so pretty, Nami.

1387
00:58:46,207 --> 00:58:48,807
(It tastes the best when you eat it in one bite)

1388
00:58:50,473 --> 00:58:51,673
Is it really good?

1389
00:58:51,673 --> 00:58:52,907
(The taste is spot on)

1390
00:58:53,307 --> 00:58:54,373
How is it?

1391
00:58:56,040 --> 00:58:57,973
(There's no need for words)

1392
00:58:58,073 --> 00:59:00,140
It feels like you're curing your hangover.

1393
00:59:02,173 --> 00:59:04,673
- We're full now. / - Yes.

1394
00:59:05,307 --> 00:59:06,573
What will we do next?

1395
00:59:06,773 --> 00:59:09,640
- We enjoyed nature in Oslob. / - Yes.

1396
00:59:09,707 --> 00:59:11,640
Now we have to see...

1397
00:59:11,640 --> 00:59:14,107
The panorama of Cebu City.

1398
00:59:14,673 --> 00:59:16,573
- At the observatory? / - Yes, at the observatory.

1399
00:59:16,573 --> 00:59:18,573
I planned a fun event.

1400
00:59:19,173 --> 00:59:20,340
(Conquering the Cebu City)

1401
00:59:20,340 --> 00:59:24,040
(Unusual city observatory)

1402
00:59:24,040 --> 00:59:29,040
(20 minutes by car to the city observatory)

1403
00:59:30,807 --> 00:59:32,307
The weather is really nice today.

1404
00:59:32,307 --> 00:59:35,140
- It's nice. Can you feel it now? / - Yes.

1405
00:59:35,140 --> 00:59:36,473
It really feels like we're on a city tour.

1406
00:59:36,473 --> 00:59:38,040
- Right? / - Where are we going right now?

1407
00:59:38,040 --> 00:59:40,707
There's a place where you see Cebu City in a glance.

1408
00:59:40,707 --> 00:59:41,840
- Really? / - Yes.

1409
00:59:41,840 --> 00:59:43,407
It's the highest building among all the buildings.

1410
00:59:43,907 --> 00:59:45,640
- In Cebu? / - Yes, among all of Cebu.

1411
00:59:45,640 --> 00:59:47,740
- Is it dangerous? / - No, it's not dangerous at all.

1412
00:59:47,740 --> 00:59:49,640
If it was dangerous, they wouldn't make it here.

1413
00:59:49,640 --> 00:59:51,107
- It's on the 38th floor. / - Yes.

1414
00:59:51,340 --> 00:59:53,507
- Even babies do it. / - Even babies do it?

1415
00:59:54,107 --> 00:59:55,273
You're talking about weird babies.

1416
00:59:55,973 --> 00:59:58,840
They always say that even babies can do it.

1417
00:59:58,840 --> 01:00:00,540
Did I see it wrong?

1418
01:00:00,540 --> 01:00:02,340
Are we going to do this?

1419
01:00:03,573 --> 01:00:05,707
Yes. Doesn't it seem like a lot of fun?

1420
01:00:05,707 --> 01:00:08,140
Do you want to do this or the skywalk?

1421
01:00:08,573 --> 01:00:10,140
I'll do this.

1422
01:00:10,140 --> 01:00:12,373
- This is better. / - Gosh.

1423
01:00:12,373 --> 01:00:15,407
- It's similar to the Las Vegas one. / - Yes.

1424
01:00:15,407 --> 01:00:16,540
- It's high. / - Gosh.

1425
01:00:17,773 --> 01:00:19,040
(A zip line across buildings)

1426
01:00:19,040 --> 01:00:20,440
- What is that? / - Gosh.

1427
01:00:20,440 --> 01:00:22,907
- That's so scary. / - There really isn't an age limit.

1428
01:00:22,907 --> 01:00:25,773
They restrict by people's height.

1429
01:00:25,773 --> 01:00:28,240
(But this is the reason why they came here)

1430
01:00:30,307 --> 01:00:31,973
- Gosh. / - Just the look of it is thrilling.

1431
01:00:32,373 --> 01:00:34,207
- Just the look of it is thrilling. / - This was so...

1432
01:00:34,207 --> 01:00:35,573
Even I was scared.

1433
01:00:35,840 --> 01:00:38,907
(A thrilling activity in the sky)

1434
01:00:38,907 --> 01:00:40,040
- I can't do it. / - Oh, my.

1435
01:00:40,207 --> 01:00:43,507
- Let's not do that. / - What is that?

1436
01:00:43,507 --> 01:00:46,540
That's ridiculous. I'm scared.

1437
01:00:47,373 --> 01:00:50,240
(Edge coaster and entrance fee, $11.60)

1438
01:00:50,240 --> 01:00:51,540
This view...

1439
01:00:51,540 --> 01:00:54,273
We can't see Cebu City in one glance.

1440
01:00:54,273 --> 01:00:55,807
- Right... / - Yes.

1441
01:00:56,473 --> 01:00:57,840
It'll relieve my stress.

1442
01:00:58,507 --> 01:01:01,507
I think they're going to make something for us.

1443
01:01:01,507 --> 01:01:04,140
Are they giving us safety regulations...

1444
01:01:05,040 --> 01:01:07,807
- And asking for our signatures? / - No.

1445
01:01:07,807 --> 01:01:10,607
It's just saying that it'll be fun.

1446
01:01:10,607 --> 01:01:12,340
It says that it'll be fun?

1447
01:01:13,273 --> 01:01:14,673
- That it's fun? / - Nami is doing a good job.

1448
01:01:14,673 --> 01:01:17,307
- Is it okay? / - It's okay. It's safe.

1449
01:01:17,307 --> 01:01:20,307
Won't it shake when the wind blows?

1450
01:01:20,307 --> 01:01:23,040
No, it's been 10 years since it opened.

1451
01:01:23,040 --> 01:01:24,140
They never had an accident.

1452
01:01:24,740 --> 01:01:26,440
- Where do you want to sit? / - But the view is...

1453
01:01:26,440 --> 01:01:28,340
- Really nice. / - Isn't it amazing?

1454
01:01:28,973 --> 01:01:30,507
It's so beautiful today.

1455
01:01:30,507 --> 01:01:32,107
- Isn't it beautiful? / - Yes.

1456
01:01:32,107 --> 01:01:34,073
I think we have a good range of visibility here.

1457
01:01:34,073 --> 01:01:36,607
- But it's too windy. / - Yes.

1458
01:01:36,773 --> 01:01:38,907
Help me? Really?

1459
01:01:39,040 --> 01:01:44,073
(She sits down frantically)

1460
01:01:45,507 --> 01:01:48,407
- It's done? / - Yes.

1461
01:01:49,207 --> 01:01:51,407
Okay, just hold here.

1462
01:01:51,407 --> 01:01:53,173
Or free hands, okay?

1463
01:01:53,640 --> 01:01:55,140
The view is really amazing.

1464
01:01:55,773 --> 01:01:56,973
What is this place?

1465
01:01:57,973 --> 01:01:59,240
Isn't this amazing?

1466
01:01:59,540 --> 01:02:02,173
The view is so nice.

1467
01:02:02,473 --> 01:02:05,707
- The view... / - But I wish I wasn't sitting here.

1468
01:02:06,007 --> 01:02:07,207
It would have been so nice.

1469
01:02:07,207 --> 01:02:08,740
Do you wish you weren't sitting here?

1470
01:02:09,573 --> 01:02:12,907
- Look, it's safe. / - What?

1471
01:02:14,307 --> 01:02:16,307
(Serious)

1472
01:02:16,307 --> 01:02:18,640
- All we do is just sit here, right? / - Yes.

1473
01:02:18,640 --> 01:02:20,140
As if you'd just sit there.

1474
01:02:20,140 --> 01:02:22,940
(She can't relax at all)

1475
01:02:24,007 --> 01:02:25,807
Slow, okay?

1476
01:02:25,807 --> 01:02:26,907
(52 Tour can't back down anymore)

1477
01:02:26,907 --> 01:02:30,340
- Let's go! / - Do you watch the view there?

1478
01:02:30,340 --> 01:02:32,607
- I also thought that at first. / - We're moving.

1479
01:02:32,607 --> 01:02:34,840
- I'm sure it would lean forward. / - Right.

1480
01:02:34,840 --> 01:02:37,907
- Oh, my God. / - It isn't that fast.

1481
01:02:37,907 --> 01:02:39,073
(Screaming)

1482
01:02:39,073 --> 01:02:40,140
What happened?

1483
01:02:40,140 --> 01:02:41,773
I didn't know that it would be like this.

1484
01:02:42,373 --> 01:02:45,640
It doesn't move straight. It tilts to the front.

1485
01:02:45,640 --> 01:02:47,207
(Edge Coaster starts tilting as soon as it moves)

1486
01:02:47,207 --> 01:02:48,973
What's going on?

1487
01:02:49,573 --> 01:02:50,573
(Oh, my)

1488
01:02:52,040 --> 01:02:54,073
- Are you looking down? / - As if you'll fall off?

1489
01:02:54,073 --> 01:02:55,373
Yes, it feels like you'll fall off.

1490
01:02:55,373 --> 01:02:56,573
(Thrilling)

1491
01:02:57,573 --> 01:02:59,440
(The beautiful panorama of the city is before them)

1492
01:02:59,440 --> 01:03:00,740
What are we going to do?

1493
01:03:01,840 --> 01:03:04,373
- That must be really scary. / - It really was.

1494
01:03:04,373 --> 01:03:06,107
(The thrilling charm of Edge Coaster)

1495
01:03:06,107 --> 01:03:08,707
- We kept going like that. / - Oh, my.

1496
01:03:08,707 --> 01:03:11,573
Nami! How can I enjoy this?

1497
01:03:11,573 --> 01:03:15,373
This isn't enjoying the view of downtown!

1498
01:03:15,873 --> 01:03:18,340
Are you sure it's not broken? Is it usually like this?

1499
01:03:18,340 --> 01:03:20,173
Yes, it goes like this automatically at first.

1500
01:03:20,173 --> 01:03:22,140
Hold on, how do I do this?

1501
01:03:22,140 --> 01:03:25,007
There we go. It's okay now.

1502
01:03:26,340 --> 01:03:28,673
- We can control it. / - I found out how to control it.

1503
01:03:28,907 --> 01:03:31,173
- Can you control it? / - I found out how to control it.

1504
01:03:31,173 --> 01:03:33,107
- Did you find out then? / - Yes.

1505
01:03:33,407 --> 01:03:35,540
- I was really scared. / - This is fun.

1506
01:03:35,540 --> 01:03:37,607
I think Sookyung will lose her voice from that.

1507
01:03:37,607 --> 01:03:38,840
Don't touch that.

1508
01:03:39,240 --> 01:03:41,707
- Don't touch that. / - Enjoy the view now.

1509
01:03:42,773 --> 01:03:45,873
- Can you control it? / - Yes, we can control it.

1510
01:03:45,873 --> 01:03:46,973
But we didn't know at first.

1511
01:03:46,973 --> 01:03:48,073
(She regained her peace of mind)

1512
01:03:48,073 --> 01:03:49,607
I wondered what this was for.

1513
01:03:49,607 --> 01:03:51,207
Look at that.

1514
01:03:52,273 --> 01:03:53,940
(After screaming, they saw picturesque views)

1515
01:03:53,940 --> 01:03:55,707
I can't see anything right now.

1516
01:03:56,007 --> 01:03:57,340
Look afar.

1517
01:04:02,807 --> 01:04:07,840
(It makes you feel like you can forgive anything)

1518
01:04:07,840 --> 01:04:09,407
No!

1519
01:04:10,573 --> 01:04:13,007
You have to do that.

1520
01:04:13,007 --> 01:04:15,173
(It's really entertaining for the viewers)

1521
01:04:16,740 --> 01:04:20,540
(Press)

1522
01:04:21,607 --> 01:04:23,607
(Excited, horrified)

1523
01:04:25,073 --> 01:04:26,440
This is really funny.

1524
01:04:27,740 --> 01:04:29,173
It must be fun.

1525
01:04:29,173 --> 01:04:30,407
It was fun.

1526
01:04:30,773 --> 01:04:33,073
Nami wouldn't have done...

1527
01:04:33,073 --> 01:04:35,807
Anything if Sookyung didn't react at all.

1528
01:04:35,807 --> 01:04:38,473
It's fun to tease people like her.

1529
01:04:38,473 --> 01:04:41,207
- Yes. / - It seems like she's laughing.

1530
01:04:41,207 --> 01:04:43,273
I think she's enjoying it.

1531
01:04:43,273 --> 01:04:44,473
No!

1532
01:04:45,640 --> 01:04:47,907
- She's playful. / - Yes, I'm playful.

1533
01:04:47,907 --> 01:04:50,107
- I wanted it to be fun. / - It's fun if you ride it like that.

1534
01:04:50,107 --> 01:04:51,773
This is so funny.

1535
01:04:52,840 --> 01:04:54,773
(Crying)

1536
01:04:54,773 --> 01:04:56,173
You're so adorable.

1537
01:04:56,373 --> 01:04:58,407
Why aren't they letting us get off?

1538
01:04:59,107 --> 01:05:00,740
Sookyung.

1539
01:05:00,740 --> 01:05:03,940
It's funny for the viewers to see you cry.

1540
01:05:03,940 --> 01:05:06,307
I don't want to show people this.

1541
01:05:06,307 --> 01:05:09,473
I want to be seen as the strongest person in the world.

1542
01:05:09,473 --> 01:05:13,173
Sookyung. Sookyung is crying.

1543
01:05:13,173 --> 01:05:14,140
She's still pretty.

1544
01:05:14,140 --> 01:05:16,207
- Isn't she so pretty? / - She's still pretty.

1545
01:05:16,207 --> 01:05:17,207
It's funny.

1546
01:05:17,207 --> 01:05:19,673
It seems like Sookyung is laughing.

1547
01:05:19,673 --> 01:05:21,673
(Nami enjoys teasing Sookyung)

1548
01:05:21,673 --> 01:05:23,840
It's so moving.

1549
01:05:24,840 --> 01:05:28,373
I can't explain this in words.

1550
01:05:28,373 --> 01:05:29,873
There's more to what you can see.

1551
01:05:29,873 --> 01:05:32,907
Please come here and experience it yourself.

1552
01:05:32,907 --> 01:05:35,373
- I want to kill you. / - Do you want to kill me?

1553
01:05:35,840 --> 01:05:38,107
We're going to eat...

1554
01:05:38,107 --> 01:05:40,773
- Your favorite food. / - She's crying.

1555
01:05:40,773 --> 01:05:43,140
- Yes. / - I'll do everything for you.

1556
01:05:43,140 --> 01:05:44,907
I made it so fun that she cried.

1557
01:05:44,907 --> 01:05:46,507
I'll do everything you want.

1558
01:05:46,707 --> 01:05:49,573
- I want to grab your hair. / - I'll let you grab my hair.

1559
01:05:49,573 --> 01:05:50,973
I have a lot of hair.

1560
01:05:56,140 --> 01:06:00,040
(Conquering the Cebu City, popular places)

1561
01:06:00,040 --> 01:06:02,707
(10 minutes by car from the observatory)

1562
01:06:02,707 --> 01:06:04,707
Is it already over? What?

1563
01:06:04,707 --> 01:06:06,407
- Is it already 52 hours? / - I feel sad.

1564
01:06:06,407 --> 01:06:07,740
- What a shame. / - Already?

1565
01:06:07,740 --> 01:06:10,907
It's such a shame that it's already the last day.

1566
01:06:10,907 --> 01:06:13,373
- This is the last location, right? / - That's right.

1567
01:06:13,373 --> 01:06:16,473
I heard it was nice if we end

1568
01:06:16,473 --> 01:06:19,273
the tour at a hot place.

1569
01:06:19,273 --> 01:06:21,773
This is the night market.

1570
01:06:21,773 --> 01:06:23,807
- The night market? / - You have to go there.

1571
01:06:23,807 --> 01:06:26,007
This place is called IT Park.

1572
01:06:26,007 --> 01:06:28,073
It feels similar to Korea's Cheongdam.

1573
01:06:28,073 --> 01:06:31,140
- Is this Cebu's Cheongdam? / - Yes, Cheongdam.

1574
01:06:33,907 --> 01:06:37,307
It feels like Cheonggyecheon...

1575
01:06:37,307 --> 01:06:38,173
That's right.

1576
01:06:38,173 --> 01:06:40,940
It feels like where there are a lot of food trucks.

1577
01:06:40,940 --> 01:06:42,440
- Doesn't it feel like that? / - Yes.

1578
01:06:42,440 --> 01:06:45,707
This place is called Sugbo Mercado.

1579
01:06:45,707 --> 01:06:47,440
"Sugbo" means Cebu and

1580
01:06:47,440 --> 01:06:49,440
"Mercado" means night market.

1581
01:06:50,040 --> 01:06:52,607
It's the hottest place in Cebu.

1582
01:06:52,607 --> 01:06:53,973
Does it open every day?

1583
01:06:53,973 --> 01:06:56,973
- Only on Thursdays to Sundays. / - Weekends.

1584
01:06:56,973 --> 01:07:00,307
- Can we go there on the weekends? / - Of course.

1585
01:07:00,307 --> 01:07:03,773
It starts from 5 p.m. to 1 a.m.

1586
01:07:03,773 --> 01:07:06,240
- You can eat before your flight. / - Yes.

1587
01:07:06,240 --> 01:07:09,307
That's so nice. It's a perfect course.

1588
01:07:09,307 --> 01:07:12,540
You should eat there and then go to the airport.

1589
01:07:12,540 --> 01:07:16,040
Since it's the last day, eat whatever you want.

1590
01:07:16,040 --> 01:07:20,740
Eat everything. There are also a lot of things to see.

1591
01:07:20,740 --> 01:07:22,640
What do you want? I want to eat that.

1592
01:07:23,373 --> 01:07:25,173
- "I want to eat that." / - That looks good.

1593
01:07:25,173 --> 01:07:28,307
- Let's have one each. / - That sounds nice.

1594
01:07:31,907 --> 01:07:34,173
- There are a lot of people. / - It's crowded, right?

1595
01:07:34,173 --> 01:07:36,540
- Since it's the weekend. / - You're right.

1596
01:07:36,540 --> 01:07:38,973
(The last bit of 52 Tour will start right now)

1597
01:07:40,907 --> 01:07:42,373
We should have come earlier.

1598
01:07:42,373 --> 01:07:45,240
It's been 3 years since this place has opened.

1599
01:07:45,240 --> 01:07:46,440
- About 3 years? / - Yes.

1600
01:07:46,440 --> 01:07:49,340
- I think it will be perfect... / - Yes.

1601
01:07:49,340 --> 01:07:50,907
If we end the trip like a festival and go back.

1602
01:07:50,907 --> 01:07:53,273
- There are so many good foods. / - This.

1603
01:07:53,273 --> 01:07:54,840
Do you want to eat this?

1604
01:07:54,840 --> 01:07:57,573
This is called lechon.

1605
01:07:58,307 --> 01:08:00,140
- You have to eat lechon. / - That's right.

1606
01:08:01,573 --> 01:08:02,573
Is that a baby pig?

1607
01:08:02,573 --> 01:08:04,073
You don't need anything else.

1608
01:08:04,073 --> 01:08:05,373
It's the traditional dish.

1609
01:08:05,373 --> 01:08:05,573
It's so savory.

1610
01:08:05,573 --> 01:08:07,307
It's a rare dish that they treat for guests.

1611
01:08:07,307 --> 01:08:08,407
- It's a whole pig. / - It's so tender.

1612
01:08:08,407 --> 01:08:10,940
I heard about this. It's a traditional Filipino dish.

1613
01:08:10,940 --> 01:08:12,407
Let's try a little.

1614
01:08:12,407 --> 01:08:13,607
The skin looks good.

1615
01:08:13,607 --> 01:08:15,240
- Let's try this. / - Wait in line.

1616
01:08:15,240 --> 01:08:16,607
Wait in line.

1617
01:08:16,607 --> 01:08:18,107
Everything grill?

1618
01:08:18,107 --> 01:08:19,373
(Crowded)

1619
01:08:21,740 --> 01:08:24,040
- Hello. / - Hello.

1620
01:08:24,040 --> 01:08:27,373
- The skewers look good. / - I want to eat shrimp.

1621
01:08:27,373 --> 01:08:29,440
- 99 pesos. / - Shrimp.

1622
01:08:29,707 --> 01:08:31,940
- Chicken? / - You need to eat one each.

1623
01:08:31,940 --> 01:08:34,907
(Chicken skewers and shrimp skewers)

1624
01:08:34,907 --> 01:08:36,440
(Pork skewers)

1625
01:08:36,440 --> 01:08:37,373
- Should we try one each? / - Okay.

1626
01:08:37,373 --> 01:08:39,173
- One, one, one. / - Yeah.

1627
01:08:39,173 --> 01:08:40,073
Thank you.

1628
01:08:40,073 --> 01:08:42,673
- Enjoy your food. / - Enjoy your food.

1629
01:08:42,673 --> 01:08:45,040
- It's a set. / - They have everything.

1630
01:08:45,640 --> 01:08:48,873
- That looks good. / - It looks good with the sauce.

1631
01:08:48,873 --> 01:08:50,340
(The last banquet they enjoyed before going home)

1632
01:08:50,340 --> 01:08:52,407
The grilled skewers were $3.10.

1633
01:08:53,573 --> 01:08:54,707
It looks good.

1634
01:08:55,373 --> 01:08:58,140
- Let's finish this and eat dessert. / - Okay.

1635
01:08:58,873 --> 01:09:01,407
- Thank you for the food. / - I'll try the lechon first.

1636
01:09:01,407 --> 01:09:02,473
(She tries the traditional Filipino dish, lechon, first)

1637
01:09:04,040 --> 01:09:05,840
(Crispy)

1638
01:09:06,240 --> 01:09:07,873
It's so good.

1639
01:09:08,573 --> 01:09:12,207
- I shot a movie in the Philippines. / - Yes, that's right.

1640
01:09:12,207 --> 01:09:14,507
I have a memory of this being really delicious.

1641
01:09:14,507 --> 01:09:16,373
- Really? / - Yes.

1642
01:09:16,373 --> 01:09:17,973
It's still good no matter when I eat it.

1643
01:09:17,973 --> 01:09:20,640
- It's good. / - It feels like I'm treated like royalty.

1644
01:09:20,640 --> 01:09:22,007
That's right.

1645
01:09:22,840 --> 01:09:24,407
It's so tender.

1646
01:09:25,073 --> 01:09:27,973
(It's delicious)

1647
01:09:28,940 --> 01:09:31,807
Eat the shrimp since we didn't get to eat them at all.

1648
01:09:31,807 --> 01:09:33,073
(They have shrimp for the first time)

1649
01:09:33,807 --> 01:09:35,373
- Cheers. / - Cheers.

1650
01:09:38,173 --> 01:09:39,773
(52 Tour fell in love with the charm of the night market)

1651
01:09:39,773 --> 01:09:42,240
It feels different from how it looks.

1652
01:09:42,573 --> 01:09:43,707
But it's good.

1653
01:09:45,107 --> 01:09:48,140
- How could it be so moist? / - Right?

1654
01:09:48,140 --> 01:09:49,807
This is perfect to eat with alcohol.

1655
01:09:50,340 --> 01:09:52,807
It's perfect for alcohol, but I'm afraid that we might

1656
01:09:52,807 --> 01:09:54,540
just stay here and eat when we have to go.

1657
01:09:54,540 --> 01:09:55,207
No, we can't do that.

1658
01:09:55,207 --> 01:09:57,473
We can't do that. That's why I'm holding back.

1659
01:09:57,840 --> 01:10:00,907
I love these Filipino peppers so much.

1660
01:10:00,907 --> 01:10:03,673
- Isn't it spicy? / - I brought it with me. It's spicy.

1661
01:10:04,173 --> 01:10:05,273
Should I also try it?

1662
01:10:05,740 --> 01:10:07,173
My mouth is on fire right now.

1663
01:10:07,173 --> 01:10:08,807
- Really? Is it that spicy? / - Yes.

1664
01:10:09,440 --> 01:10:10,907
Should I just try half of it?

1665
01:10:10,907 --> 01:10:12,440
- I can't eat spicy food. / - Oh, my.

1666
01:10:12,440 --> 01:10:14,307
- No, don't do it. / - Don't eat it.

1667
01:10:15,773 --> 01:10:17,040
(She tries fearlessly)

1668
01:10:17,273 --> 01:10:18,273
How is it?

1669
01:10:18,273 --> 01:10:19,807
- I knew that. / - How is it?

1670
01:10:21,040 --> 01:10:22,973
(The spiciness suddenly hit her)

1671
01:10:22,973 --> 01:10:23,840
It's spicy, right?

1672
01:10:23,840 --> 01:10:26,007
It'd be cool to ride the coaster while eating that.

1673
01:10:26,007 --> 01:10:27,207
That'd be crazy.

1674
01:10:27,207 --> 01:10:28,373
That'll make her mad.

1675
01:10:28,373 --> 01:10:29,907
It feels like I'm on a trip

1676
01:10:29,907 --> 01:10:32,773
where I experience extreme situations.

1677
01:10:33,373 --> 01:10:35,207
(The extreme experience she forgot about)

1678
01:10:35,440 --> 01:10:36,973
It's getting hot suddenly.

1679
01:10:36,973 --> 01:10:38,173
Are you okay?

1680
01:10:38,773 --> 01:10:40,707
Have some more of this.

1681
01:10:41,140 --> 01:10:42,907
I want to eat halo-halo.

1682
01:10:42,907 --> 01:10:45,507
- Do you want halo-halo? Okay. / - Yes.

1683
01:10:45,507 --> 01:10:48,073
- What's halo-halo? / - It's Filipino shaved ice.

1684
01:10:49,307 --> 01:10:51,140
I wanted to try something.

1685
01:10:51,140 --> 01:10:52,640
- Ice cream? / - Yes.

1686
01:10:53,540 --> 01:10:56,540
- What's mix? / - Mixed, you will have...

1687
01:10:56,540 --> 01:10:58,640
French vanilla and taro together.

1688
01:10:58,640 --> 01:10:59,807
I want that one.

1689
01:11:02,173 --> 01:11:04,573
That's also English. "I want that one."

1690
01:11:05,007 --> 01:11:07,840
- I want that one. / - They made bread themselves...

1691
01:11:07,840 --> 01:11:09,907
And placed ice cream on top of that.

1692
01:11:09,907 --> 01:11:14,373
- It looks so good. / - They eat that in France.

1693
01:11:14,373 --> 01:11:15,607
But they also make it there.

1694
01:11:17,040 --> 01:11:19,407
- Even the performance is perfect. / - Yes.

1695
01:11:19,407 --> 01:11:21,307
It's best performance.

1696
01:11:23,273 --> 01:11:25,440
- Oh, my. / - It has the devil's jam.

1697
01:11:25,440 --> 01:11:27,140
- What is that? / - It was amazing.

1698
01:11:27,140 --> 01:11:29,107
- It must be high in calories. / - What is that?

1699
01:11:30,307 --> 01:11:33,007
Oh, my. I can't believe it.

1700
01:11:33,007 --> 01:11:35,640
- Some people don't eat the cone. / - That's right.

1701
01:11:35,640 --> 01:11:37,840
- But they will eat all of that. / - That looks so good.

1702
01:11:37,840 --> 01:11:40,507
- Stop sprinkling. / - It will taste good until the end.

1703
01:11:41,507 --> 01:11:43,473
It's bad for your diet.

1704
01:11:43,473 --> 01:11:44,873
That ice cream...

1705
01:11:44,873 --> 01:11:46,340
Be careful, it's hot.

1706
01:11:48,807 --> 01:11:51,407
- It's very hot. / - Yes.

1707
01:11:53,540 --> 01:11:55,307
(They're enjoying their ice cream)

1708
01:11:55,307 --> 01:11:56,807
- What should we eat next? / - Halo-halo.

1709
01:11:56,807 --> 01:11:58,173
- Let's eat halo-halo. / - Okay.

1710
01:11:58,807 --> 01:12:00,740
We must eat something cold when it's hot.

1711
01:12:00,740 --> 01:12:01,840
That's right.

1712
01:12:02,407 --> 01:12:03,607
Halo-halo.

1713
01:12:04,140 --> 01:12:05,707
We have tropical.

1714
01:12:05,973 --> 01:12:07,207
Tropical.

1715
01:12:08,373 --> 01:12:09,773
What does halo-halo mean?

1716
01:12:09,773 --> 01:12:12,273
Halo-halo means to mix everything.

1717
01:12:12,273 --> 01:12:14,507
In Filipino, it means to mix everything.

1718
01:12:14,507 --> 01:12:17,907
It's shaved ice, but you mix a lot of ingredients in it.

1719
01:12:19,173 --> 01:12:20,473
It's pretty.

1720
01:12:21,873 --> 01:12:24,740
- It has ube ice cream. / - Ube ice cream?

1721
01:12:24,740 --> 01:12:27,973
The purple ice cream is ube.

1722
01:12:27,973 --> 01:12:29,573
(Halo-halo to blow away the heat)

1723
01:12:31,240 --> 01:12:33,840
(She finally takes a bite of halo-halo)

1724
01:12:34,340 --> 01:12:36,173
- Why? / - Try it. It's good.

1725
01:12:36,173 --> 01:12:37,407
Is it good?

1726
01:12:40,973 --> 01:12:42,240
(Enough to make them forget about the heat)

1727
01:12:42,240 --> 01:12:43,907
How is it? Isn't it good?

1728
01:12:44,940 --> 01:12:46,407
- Isn't it really good? / - Yes.

1729
01:12:49,007 --> 01:12:52,840
They all have different flavors. Isn't that right?

1730
01:12:52,840 --> 01:12:54,307
You won't get tired of it.

1731
01:12:59,373 --> 01:13:02,107
- I want to go there. / - You won't get tired...

1732
01:13:02,107 --> 01:13:04,907
Even if you hung out there until 1 a.m.

1733
01:13:04,907 --> 01:13:05,973
That's right.

1734
01:13:05,973 --> 01:13:07,873
I also saw this earlier.

1735
01:13:07,873 --> 01:13:09,140
- What do you want to eat? / - I saw this earlier.

1736
01:13:09,540 --> 01:13:10,640
What is this?

1737
01:13:11,240 --> 01:13:13,307
- There were so many things. / - Eat this and that.

1738
01:13:13,407 --> 01:13:15,407
You can enjoy eating everything.

1739
01:13:15,407 --> 01:13:17,307
- What is that? It's so cute. / - It's cotton candy.

1740
01:13:17,307 --> 01:13:18,473
I can't believe it.

1741
01:13:19,107 --> 01:13:20,740
Oh, my.

1742
01:13:20,740 --> 01:13:22,040
- Sookyung. / - Gosh.

1743
01:13:22,907 --> 01:13:24,307
(They're happy like little children)

1744
01:13:24,307 --> 01:13:26,207
Stay still. I'll take a photo for you.

1745
01:13:26,773 --> 01:13:28,207
Can you see it? Take it like this.

1746
01:13:28,207 --> 01:13:29,040
I should take it like that.

1747
01:13:29,040 --> 01:13:31,340
1, 2, 3.

1748
01:13:32,840 --> 01:13:34,707
(Just like when we were young)

1749
01:13:34,707 --> 01:13:36,207
- That's so adorable. / - That's so adorable.

1750
01:13:36,973 --> 01:13:38,640
- Hold it. / - 1...

1751
01:13:38,940 --> 01:13:40,007
1, 2, 3.

1752
01:13:40,007 --> 01:13:42,440
(Separated)

1753
01:13:42,440 --> 01:13:43,607
Get the straw.

1754
01:13:43,773 --> 01:13:46,273
- It's so hot that it's melting. / - Gosh.

1755
01:13:46,440 --> 01:13:49,240
I think the reason why

1756
01:13:49,240 --> 01:13:51,840
they put cotton candy on top of juice...

1757
01:13:52,073 --> 01:13:54,173
Is to stop the cotton candy from melting...

1758
01:13:54,440 --> 01:13:56,207
Since the weather is so hot and humid.

1759
01:13:56,207 --> 01:14:00,273
- It will be really sweet together. / - Yeah.

1760
01:14:00,907 --> 01:14:04,573
- Sookyung looks sugar high right now. / - Yes.

1761
01:14:04,573 --> 01:14:06,507
I really love sweets.

1762
01:14:07,540 --> 01:14:09,573
- I like sweets so much. / - It's really good.

1763
01:14:09,573 --> 01:14:11,473
(It's sweet)

1764
01:14:12,773 --> 01:14:14,273
Doesn't it melt in your mouth?

1765
01:14:15,073 --> 01:14:16,207
There's nothing left.

1766
01:14:16,540 --> 01:14:17,940
It disappeared in a second.

1767
01:14:22,473 --> 01:14:25,540
(52 hours are almost up)

1768
01:14:25,540 --> 01:14:27,940
We don't have a lot of time left

1769
01:14:27,940 --> 01:14:29,507
and this is the last stop for us.

1770
01:14:29,507 --> 01:14:33,573
We took a break from Friday to Sunday for 3 days.

1771
01:14:35,440 --> 01:14:37,240
(52 Tour spent their short time in the city and nature)

1772
01:14:37,240 --> 01:14:40,173
We saw the whale shark and went to the waterfall.

1773
01:14:40,173 --> 01:14:43,340
We spent today in a completely different atmosphere.

1774
01:14:43,340 --> 01:14:45,440
It was a short time but it felt like we were here...

1775
01:14:45,440 --> 01:14:48,040
- For a week to relax. / - Yeah.

1776
01:14:48,540 --> 01:14:51,107
For the last week...

1777
01:14:51,573 --> 01:14:53,540
I shot "Gag Concert,"

1778
01:14:53,540 --> 01:14:55,173
had meetings, had rehearsals

1779
01:14:55,173 --> 01:14:58,607
and came here right away after that.

1780
01:14:58,607 --> 01:15:02,040
I felt like an office worker.

1781
01:15:02,340 --> 01:15:05,007
I wish people would think that they will be able

1782
01:15:05,007 --> 01:15:07,507
to go on a trip after seeing me.

1783
01:15:07,507 --> 01:15:10,373
I had a sense of responsibility to provide fun.

1784
01:15:10,373 --> 01:15:13,307
52 Tour really used 52 hours...

1785
01:15:13,740 --> 01:15:17,107
Really well and beautifully.

1786
01:15:17,107 --> 01:15:19,873
I think these 52 hours will be the most

1787
01:15:19,873 --> 01:15:22,807
memorable days of this year for me.

1788
01:15:28,507 --> 01:15:32,473
(Hour 0 of the 52 Tour)

1789
01:15:33,873 --> 01:15:34,640
Nice.

1790
01:15:34,640 --> 01:15:38,207
- We won. / - They're our opponents...

1791
01:15:38,207 --> 01:15:39,240
If I was an office worker,

1792
01:15:39,240 --> 01:15:41,440
I think I would like to go on the weekend.

1793
01:15:41,440 --> 01:15:43,240
- That's right. / - I only need...

1794
01:15:43,240 --> 01:15:45,807
To see the whale shark to be satisfied.

1795
01:15:45,807 --> 01:15:48,873
Families will surely love the whale sharks.

1796
01:15:48,873 --> 01:15:49,873
- Of course. / - Yes.

1797
01:15:49,873 --> 01:15:51,973
If Seoeon and Seojun see this, they will make a fuss.

1798
01:15:51,973 --> 01:15:54,040
They will really enjoy it.

1799
01:15:54,040 --> 01:15:55,940
- Children will really like it. / - Is there anything...

1800
01:15:55,940 --> 01:15:59,040
To be aware of on the whale shark tour?

1801
01:15:59,040 --> 01:16:02,640
- You must wear a life vest. / - Yes.

1802
01:16:02,640 --> 01:16:05,507
You can't touch the whale shark

1803
01:16:05,507 --> 01:16:08,107
or do anything threatening to it.

1804
01:16:08,107 --> 01:16:12,907
Also, we can't stop or disturb their movements.

1805
01:16:12,907 --> 01:16:14,407
That's right.

1806
01:16:14,407 --> 01:16:16,173
What if the whale shark doesn't come out

1807
01:16:16,173 --> 01:16:17,540
because it doesn't feel like it?

1808
01:16:17,540 --> 01:16:19,007
- They might not be there, right? / - But those guys...

1809
01:16:19,007 --> 01:16:21,340
Have a sense of responsibility, so they'll be there.

1810
01:16:21,340 --> 01:16:23,407
- The whale sharks? / - Yes.

1811
01:16:23,407 --> 01:16:24,973
Can you see them every day?

1812
01:16:24,973 --> 01:16:27,973
As long as there isn't a problem with the weather,

1813
01:16:27,973 --> 01:16:29,940
they live around there.

1814
01:16:30,340 --> 01:16:31,207
- You'll be able to see. / - Also...

1815
01:16:31,207 --> 01:16:33,373
The government takes care of them.

1816
01:16:33,373 --> 01:16:35,440
- They're not locked up there. / - Right.

1817
01:16:35,440 --> 01:16:37,140
Let's check the expenses.

1818
01:16:37,140 --> 01:16:38,673
- Already? / - Are you confident about it?

1819
01:16:38,673 --> 01:16:40,907
- Of course. / - You saw the prices earlier.

1820
01:16:40,907 --> 01:16:43,607
I think they spent $500 to $600, at least.

1821
01:16:43,607 --> 01:16:45,707
- $500 to $600? / - For an average trip...

1822
01:16:45,707 --> 01:16:47,773
- For both of them? / - That's way too high.

1823
01:16:47,773 --> 01:16:50,240
Not including airfares,

1824
01:16:50,240 --> 01:16:52,607
what is the final expense?

1825
01:16:52,607 --> 01:16:55,240
- The expense. / - Per person.

1826
01:16:55,607 --> 01:16:57,040
In total...

1827
01:16:57,040 --> 01:16:59,873
$285.

1828
01:16:59,873 --> 01:17:01,573
($285 per person)

1829
01:17:01,573 --> 01:17:03,673
- That's quite cheap. / - It's really cheap.

1830
01:17:03,673 --> 01:17:05,140
- Isn't it so nice? / - Isn't it so good?

1831
01:17:05,140 --> 01:17:06,473
- It doesn't include airfares. / - Yes.

1832
01:17:06,640 --> 01:17:09,840
- With the hotel and snorkeling? / - Yes.

1833
01:17:09,907 --> 01:17:11,773
The pick-up service, entrance fee

1834
01:17:11,773 --> 01:17:12,807
and snorkeling equipment.

1835
01:17:12,807 --> 01:17:15,273
- All included. / - That's all included.

1836
01:17:15,273 --> 01:17:16,540
It's too cheap over there.

1837
01:17:17,140 --> 01:17:18,607
It's cheap.

1838
01:17:18,607 --> 01:17:21,840
We went to Oslob right after we landed.

1839
01:17:21,840 --> 01:17:23,140
So we didn't stay...

1840
01:17:23,140 --> 01:17:25,073
- At a hotel for the first day. / - That's right.

1841
01:17:25,073 --> 01:17:27,107
- We slept in the car. / - They slept in the car.

1842
01:17:27,740 --> 01:17:29,973
- They went to Oslob. / - They saved on a hotel.

1843
01:17:29,973 --> 01:17:32,240
People who were stressed from work

1844
01:17:32,240 --> 01:17:34,340
will feel better after seeing...

1845
01:17:34,340 --> 01:17:35,973
- The whale shark in the morning. / - Yes.

1846
01:17:35,973 --> 01:17:38,840
I think their plan deserves five stars.

1847
01:17:38,840 --> 01:17:40,307
It's because...

1848
01:17:40,307 --> 01:17:43,773
Okay, would you like to go to Cebu, Philippines

1849
01:17:43,773 --> 01:17:45,307
according to 52 Tour's plan?

1850
01:17:45,640 --> 01:17:47,507
Please vote.

1851
01:17:48,673 --> 01:17:51,807
(They planned a trip for last-minute summer vacation)

1852
01:17:52,873 --> 01:17:56,273
(What will the judges choose?)

1853
01:17:56,273 --> 01:17:57,840
We saw the Cebu trip.

1854
01:17:57,840 --> 01:18:00,573
Next week, the dream team will leave.

1855
01:18:00,573 --> 01:18:01,873
They really are the dream team.

1856
01:18:02,040 --> 01:18:03,773
- They can speak the language. / - Yes.

1857
01:18:03,773 --> 01:18:06,007
- They know good foods. / - They're gourmets.

1858
01:18:06,007 --> 01:18:08,673
Next week, we will reveal the Chengdu trip in China.

1859
01:18:08,673 --> 01:18:10,773
Please look forward to next week too.

1860
01:18:10,773 --> 01:18:12,773
- Thank you. / - Thank you.

1861
01:18:14,840 --> 01:18:16,207
(Next Episode)

1862
01:18:17,573 --> 01:18:18,740
I feel excited.

1863
01:18:18,740 --> 01:18:20,573
I see it, I see it. I saw a foot.

1864
01:18:20,573 --> 01:18:23,373
- Wow. / - Wow, this is it.

1865
01:18:24,240 --> 01:18:26,473
Sichuan and Chengdu equals...

1866
01:18:27,973 --> 01:18:30,373
- Panda... / - Oh, my goodness.

1867
01:18:31,840 --> 01:18:33,707
It's time to eat.

1868
01:18:34,273 --> 01:18:36,373
- Everyone will like this. / - Everyone.

1869
01:18:38,773 --> 01:18:40,173
This is the Anshun Bridge.

1870
01:18:40,173 --> 01:18:41,240
It's so pretty.

1871
01:18:41,240 --> 01:18:43,940
It expresses China perfectly.

1872
01:18:44,640 --> 01:18:48,040
(Battle Trip)

1873
01:18:48,040 --> 01:19:05,473
("Power Up" by Red Velvet)
