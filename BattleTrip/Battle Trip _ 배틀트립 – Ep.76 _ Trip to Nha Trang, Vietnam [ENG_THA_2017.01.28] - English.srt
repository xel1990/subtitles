1
00:00:02,843 --> 00:00:05,477
It's time for Battle Trip where we give you

2
00:00:05,477 --> 00:00:07,043
great tips for trips.

3
00:00:07,043 --> 00:00:08,443
It's winter. The weather's colder.

4
00:00:08,443 --> 00:00:10,477
You tend not to leave the house at times like this.

5
00:00:10,477 --> 00:00:13,010
But going on trips is like a treasure

6
00:00:13,010 --> 00:00:14,043
at times like this.

7
00:00:14,043 --> 00:00:17,010
This can be the peak of the travel season.

8
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:19,377
- It is. / - Because of the holidays.

9
00:00:19,377 --> 00:00:25,610
People tend to go away with their children on holidays.

10
00:00:25,610 --> 00:00:27,043
Hwijae...

11
00:00:27,043 --> 00:00:28,677
When you think of traveling with your kids,

12
00:00:28,677 --> 00:00:29,510
shouldn't you be happy?

13
00:00:29,510 --> 00:00:31,710
- Of course. / - It makes me really happy...

14
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:32,810
But it's also so hard.

15
00:00:32,810 --> 00:00:34,477
Up till what age is it hard?

16
00:00:34,477 --> 00:00:36,110
How much do they need to grow...

17
00:00:36,110 --> 00:00:37,877
It's still getting harder.

18
00:00:37,877 --> 00:00:39,743
Now that they can talk, they don't listen.

19
00:00:40,610 --> 00:00:41,777
It's that time.

20
00:00:41,777 --> 00:00:44,510
For the 2 week holiday,

21
00:00:44,510 --> 00:00:46,377
we traveled to Guam with the kids.

22
00:00:47,343 --> 00:00:49,077
- Enjoy life. / - Yeah.

23
00:00:49,077 --> 00:00:50,677
You went quickly.

24
00:00:50,677 --> 00:00:51,877
I really like it

25
00:00:51,877 --> 00:00:54,677
when the airport and the hotel are close.

26
00:00:54,677 --> 00:00:56,110
- Being close... / - I prefer that.

27
00:00:56,110 --> 00:00:56,810
That's a good thing.

28
00:00:56,810 --> 00:00:58,377
That's most convenient with kids.

29
00:00:58,377 --> 00:01:01,043
With an evening flight, the kids go to sleep.

30
00:01:01,043 --> 00:01:03,210
And I can drink then on the plane.

31
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:04,743
There are various conditions.

32
00:01:04,743 --> 00:01:06,543
So I really prefer Guam and Saipan.

33
00:01:06,543 --> 00:01:08,043
I favor Southeast Asia.

34
00:01:08,043 --> 00:01:08,877
It's warm there too.

35
00:01:08,877 --> 00:01:10,410
- It's good to travel. / - Sikyung...

36
00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:12,143
When I call him on the weekends,

37
00:01:12,143 --> 00:01:13,410
he's always in Japan.

38
00:01:13,410 --> 00:01:16,310
I'm a rookie singer in Japan.

39
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:17,477
What are you doing over there?

40
00:01:17,477 --> 00:01:18,677
You are a rookie?

41
00:01:18,677 --> 00:01:20,243
I go on radio.

42
00:01:20,243 --> 00:01:22,110
I've been on TV for 7 minutes.

43
00:01:24,110 --> 00:01:26,377
I sing in front of the shopping mall.

44
00:01:26,377 --> 00:01:27,710
- You're back to being a rookie? / - Yes.

45
00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:30,310
They announce me in front of the crowds.

46
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:32,743
It's kind of my second life...

47
00:01:32,743 --> 00:01:33,943
- As a rookie singer. / - In Japan?

48
00:01:33,943 --> 00:01:35,977
No one there knows who I am.

49
00:01:35,977 --> 00:01:37,110
Didn't you go on holiday, Kim Sook?

50
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:39,777
I'm too busy to travel these days.

51
00:01:39,777 --> 00:01:43,210
If I could sit in a warm room, watch Battle Trip

52
00:01:43,210 --> 00:01:45,110
and eat mandarins until my fingers go yellow...

53
00:01:45,110 --> 00:01:46,577
- Right. / - Nothing would beat that.

54
00:01:46,577 --> 00:01:48,877
Where will we go today?

55
00:01:48,877 --> 00:01:50,643
Let's meet the person that requested the trip.

56
00:01:50,643 --> 00:01:52,043
Let's meet them now.

57
00:01:52,043 --> 00:01:54,577
Hello, I live in Jinju.

58
00:01:54,577 --> 00:01:56,943
I'm Gwon Minseong, 33 years old.

59
00:01:56,943 --> 00:02:00,177
I'm planning a hot spring trip for the winter.

60
00:02:00,177 --> 00:02:02,410
Please plan a unique hot spring trip

61
00:02:02,410 --> 00:02:06,110
that will refresh my mind and body on Battle Trip.

62
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:09,010
A hot spring trip is perfect.

63
00:02:09,010 --> 00:02:10,843
Going to a hot spring when it's cold...

64
00:02:10,843 --> 00:02:14,477
Hot springs are like theme parks these days.

65
00:02:14,477 --> 00:02:16,477
There are all sorts of varieties.

66
00:02:16,477 --> 00:02:18,177
- It'd be fun to go to each one. / - In Korea...

67
00:02:18,177 --> 00:02:19,577
There's Paradise Spa Dogo in Chungcheon

68
00:02:19,577 --> 00:02:20,677
and Onyang Hot Spring.

69
00:02:20,677 --> 00:02:21,277
So many nice places.

70
00:02:21,277 --> 00:02:22,677
There's Suanbo Hot Spring as well.

71
00:02:22,677 --> 00:02:25,177
The greatest charm of the hot spring is in winter...

72
00:02:25,177 --> 00:02:27,010
- And the ones that are outdoors. / - They're so nice.

73
00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:29,510
When you go in there and just have your head out,

74
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:30,843
you start to sweat on your face.

75
00:02:30,843 --> 00:02:33,577
- Then you step out and sit on the ice. / - After rest.

76
00:02:33,577 --> 00:02:35,143
Then it starts steaming from your body.

77
00:02:35,143 --> 00:02:37,677
- The metabolism kicks in. / - You go back when it's cold.

78
00:02:37,677 --> 00:02:39,210
The snow piles up, right?

79
00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:41,377
You leave the beer in there

80
00:02:41,377 --> 00:02:42,210
before you go in the water.

81
00:02:43,243 --> 00:02:44,177
Just like when you go skiing.

82
00:02:44,177 --> 00:02:46,310
After 10 minutes of being in the hot spring,

83
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:47,810
the beer is really cold.

84
00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:49,243
Like watermelon in the stream.

85
00:02:49,243 --> 00:02:51,310
Right before it freezes.

86
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:53,177
- Wow, and you drink it? / - That's right.

87
00:02:53,177 --> 00:02:55,277
I'm starting to drool.

88
00:02:55,277 --> 00:02:57,977
Who visited which hot spring today?

89
00:02:57,977 --> 00:02:59,143
Let's meet them.

90
00:02:59,143 --> 00:03:01,443
Let's welcome this week's trip planners.

91
00:03:01,443 --> 00:03:02,477
Welcome.

92
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:06,010
A vacation spot like a hidden gem in Vietnam.

93
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:07,843
It's good we came here.

94
00:03:07,843 --> 00:03:09,677
Nha Trang Tour.

95
00:03:09,677 --> 00:03:10,677
Let's go!

96
00:03:11,377 --> 00:03:12,277
Check it out.

97
00:03:13,210 --> 00:03:14,577
This is perfect.

98
00:03:15,543 --> 00:03:17,143
We'll bare Fukuoka.

99
00:03:17,143 --> 00:03:18,043
Fukuoka Tour.

100
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:22,377
(Revealing the hidden hot springs)

101
00:03:22,377 --> 00:03:24,943
This week's hot spring tour is an actress special.

102
00:03:24,943 --> 00:03:25,777
Welcome!

103
00:03:26,177 --> 00:03:27,310
Hello.

104
00:03:27,843 --> 00:03:28,910
Park Jungsoo.

105
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:31,543
- You hardly appear on variety shows. / - Right.

106
00:03:31,543 --> 00:03:33,577
- I was shocked. / - I came for Hyunjoo.

107
00:03:33,577 --> 00:03:35,343
- Because of Hyunjoo? / - Yes.

108
00:03:35,343 --> 00:03:37,177
She likes me so much.

109
00:03:37,177 --> 00:03:39,077
Are you normally close?

110
00:03:39,077 --> 00:03:40,710
We're in the same agency.

111
00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:42,510
Same agency.

112
00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:44,277
With Hyunjoo...

113
00:03:44,277 --> 00:03:46,543
Her hobby is traveling and so is mine.

114
00:03:46,543 --> 00:03:47,543
So we said

115
00:03:47,543 --> 00:03:49,943
we should go together one day.

116
00:03:49,943 --> 00:03:51,477
At first, it must've been...

117
00:03:51,477 --> 00:03:52,343
You must've felt shy.

118
00:03:52,343 --> 00:03:53,443
Wasn't it embarrassing?

119
00:03:53,443 --> 00:03:54,777
She was so

120
00:03:54,777 --> 00:03:56,843
adamant about letting go.

121
00:03:56,843 --> 00:03:57,910
She told me that.

122
00:03:57,910 --> 00:04:00,877
She told me that we must let go.

123
00:04:00,877 --> 00:04:03,210
So we didn't put on makeup...

124
00:04:03,210 --> 00:04:04,443
I said this...

125
00:04:04,443 --> 00:04:05,677
She wore a bathing suit.

126
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:09,143
- Yeah, that photo... / - Even we don't wear that.

127
00:04:09,143 --> 00:04:11,210
There's a difference in their makeup.

128
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:12,643
You're right.

129
00:04:12,643 --> 00:04:15,010
- Right. / - We were completely without makeup.

130
00:04:15,010 --> 00:04:16,243
- Natural. / - I didn't wear makeup.

131
00:04:16,743 --> 00:04:18,943
With Kong Hyunjoo...

132
00:04:18,943 --> 00:04:21,710
- You'll see our bare faces. / - Okay.

133
00:04:21,710 --> 00:04:23,077
You'll see two different people.

134
00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:24,943
Following on.

135
00:04:24,943 --> 00:04:27,043
They traveled to Japan for their hot spring trip.

136
00:04:27,043 --> 00:04:29,343
We have Yang Jungah and Yun Hyeyeong.

137
00:04:29,343 --> 00:04:31,110
Hello.

138
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:34,043
We're not in the same agency...

139
00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:38,043
- But we've been close for a long time. / - We're close.

140
00:04:38,043 --> 00:04:40,243
- They're really great actresses. / - Of course.

141
00:04:40,243 --> 00:04:42,410
- And pretty. / - Are you saying we're bad actresses?

142
00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:44,310
- And pretty. / - Are you saying we're bad actresses?

143
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:46,010
No, I mean all four of you.

144
00:04:46,010 --> 00:04:47,443
No, the thing is...

145
00:04:47,443 --> 00:04:49,110
- Oh, no. / - Sung Sikyung!

146
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:51,410
- Serves you right! / - We got caught.

147
00:04:51,410 --> 00:04:53,610
It feels like I'm watching a drama.

148
00:04:54,377 --> 00:04:57,177
I've been in a drama with Sikyung.

149
00:04:57,177 --> 00:04:57,810
In the past.

150
00:04:57,810 --> 00:04:59,477
- You were in a drama together? / - Yes.

151
00:04:59,477 --> 00:05:01,677
He was a cameo in my drama.

152
00:05:01,677 --> 00:05:03,110
You're a good actor.

153
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:04,677
He's no actor.

154
00:05:04,677 --> 00:05:06,610
Hyeyeong, was there a special reason that

155
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:08,477
you chose to go to Fukuoka with Yang Jungah?

156
00:05:08,477 --> 00:05:10,477
We chose Fukuoka because...

157
00:05:10,477 --> 00:05:14,277
- It's the closest place by plane. / - It's close.

158
00:05:14,277 --> 00:05:15,377
When it comes to Fukuoka...

159
00:05:15,377 --> 00:05:17,510
- Beppu, Yufuin... / - Yufuin.

160
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:19,410
- They're the focal areas. / - Lots of Koreans.

161
00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:20,810
Instead of those places...

162
00:05:20,810 --> 00:05:22,543
We chose places

163
00:05:22,543 --> 00:05:24,177
that aren't must-visit.

164
00:05:24,177 --> 00:05:26,143
We chose secret places.

165
00:05:26,143 --> 00:05:27,643
- We love things like this. / - Really?

166
00:05:28,277 --> 00:05:29,310
That's where we went.

167
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:31,043
Being a hot spring trip,

168
00:05:31,043 --> 00:05:34,243
I feel like we had a special experience.

169
00:05:34,243 --> 00:05:35,543
I'm so curious.

170
00:05:35,543 --> 00:05:37,443
You went to Nha Trang.

171
00:05:37,443 --> 00:05:39,510
I've never heard of Nha Trang, Vietnam before.

172
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:41,610
- Are hot springs famous there? / - To be honest...

173
00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:42,910
It's the first time I've heard Nha Trang said like that.

174
00:05:42,910 --> 00:05:45,343
- I always knew of Nha Trang. / - Oh, Nha Trang.

175
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:47,643
But I've never heard of it said the Korean way.

176
00:05:47,643 --> 00:05:50,477
That's what they call Nha Trang these days.

177
00:05:50,477 --> 00:05:51,810
So you went to Nha Trang?

178
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:53,210
Yes, Nha Trang.

179
00:05:53,210 --> 00:05:55,410
I've heard of Nha Trang.

180
00:05:55,410 --> 00:05:56,877
You'll find out in a minute

181
00:05:56,877 --> 00:05:57,877
but I loved it.

182
00:05:57,877 --> 00:05:58,643
- Really? / - Yes, yes.

183
00:05:58,643 --> 00:06:00,277
You must've been to Japanese hot springs before.

184
00:06:00,277 --> 00:06:00,910
- Right. / - Yes, yes.

185
00:06:00,910 --> 00:06:01,710
Honestly,

186
00:06:01,710 --> 00:06:02,943
I had no idea there were hot springs...

187
00:06:02,943 --> 00:06:05,043
- I know. / - In Nha Trang.

188
00:06:05,043 --> 00:06:06,543
- Is there a unique hot spring? / - Because...

189
00:06:06,543 --> 00:06:10,510
I said I like hot springs, Hyunjoo looked it up.

190
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:13,377
She didn't want to get cursed out by me.

191
00:06:13,377 --> 00:06:14,410
I wanted to visit

192
00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:17,177
a special hot spring with a theme...

193
00:06:17,177 --> 00:06:19,077
- You must've been so nervous. / - So I searched...

194
00:06:19,077 --> 00:06:20,543
- What if you took her and she's like... / - I was.

195
00:06:21,343 --> 00:06:23,177
- What is this? / - What's this?

196
00:06:23,177 --> 00:06:24,277
What is this?

197
00:06:24,277 --> 00:06:24,843
That's right.

198
00:06:24,843 --> 00:06:26,610
- Like a mother-in-law. / - That's right.

199
00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:28,243
What is this place?

200
00:06:29,477 --> 00:06:30,877
On this trip...

201
00:06:30,877 --> 00:06:32,677
You won't see her act like that even for a second.

202
00:06:32,677 --> 00:06:33,210
Not at all?

203
00:06:33,210 --> 00:06:33,943
What kind of hot spring is it?

204
00:06:33,943 --> 00:06:36,277
Tell us about it.

205
00:06:36,277 --> 00:06:40,743
Nha Trang is a hidden gem of Vietnam.

206
00:06:40,743 --> 00:06:43,943
It hasn't been tainted yet.

207
00:06:43,943 --> 00:06:46,543
- You can see beautiful views. / - How was the food?

208
00:06:46,543 --> 00:06:47,743
You can look forward to it.

209
00:06:47,743 --> 00:06:48,710
Food...

210
00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:51,043
- Vietnamese food is good. / - The best?

211
00:06:51,043 --> 00:06:52,310
In terms of cost-effectiveness...

212
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:53,477
- Best in terms of cost-effectiveness. / - Effective...

213
00:06:53,477 --> 00:06:54,243
I wondered

214
00:06:54,243 --> 00:06:59,043
when I liked Vietnamese food so much.

215
00:06:59,043 --> 00:07:00,877
That's how impressed I was. I ate so much.

216
00:07:00,877 --> 00:07:02,677
- We'll have to check it out. / - It's so different.

217
00:07:02,677 --> 00:07:05,077
Japanese food is good too but Vietnamese is different.

218
00:07:05,077 --> 00:07:06,410
- Right. / - Yes.

219
00:07:06,410 --> 00:07:07,677
Let's check it out now.

220
00:07:08,477 --> 00:07:11,377
The Nha Trang, Vietnam trip.

221
00:07:11,377 --> 00:07:12,543
Let's check it out together.

222
00:07:15,477 --> 00:07:17,543
(Nha Trang, Vietnam)

223
00:07:17,543 --> 00:07:20,043
You can't leave out motorbikes with Vietnam.

224
00:07:20,043 --> 00:07:21,077
That's right.

225
00:07:24,443 --> 00:07:27,010
It's really humid over there.

226
00:07:27,010 --> 00:07:27,643
The weather was so nice.

227
00:07:27,643 --> 00:07:29,410
- What is this place? / - I thought it was Hawaii.

228
00:07:29,410 --> 00:07:30,377
It was so nice.

229
00:07:30,377 --> 00:07:31,977
(Experience both Mediterranean)

230
00:07:31,977 --> 00:07:35,377
(And Vietnamese culture)

231
00:07:35,643 --> 00:07:36,777
I need to go to Nha Trang.

232
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:39,510
(Who will plan the trip to Vietnam?)

233
00:07:40,477 --> 00:07:42,877
Hyunjoo suffered because of me.

234
00:07:44,943 --> 00:07:47,110
Where is your partner?

235
00:07:47,110 --> 00:07:48,543
Right now...

236
00:07:48,543 --> 00:07:49,710
She's not in Korea.

237
00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:52,277
She left everything to me like it was a given

238
00:07:52,277 --> 00:07:54,643
and left on a trip to Spain.

239
00:07:56,410 --> 00:07:57,110
Amazing.

240
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:58,743
She's a traveler.

241
00:07:58,743 --> 00:08:01,277
We haven't been in any dramas together...

242
00:08:01,277 --> 00:08:03,677
But we've been to many events...

243
00:08:03,677 --> 00:08:05,077
Events...

244
00:08:05,077 --> 00:08:07,343
Together.

245
00:08:07,343 --> 00:08:11,143
So I got close with her on a personal level.

246
00:08:11,143 --> 00:08:13,243
She's very young at heart.

247
00:08:13,243 --> 00:08:14,577
Like a young girl.

248
00:08:14,577 --> 00:08:15,810
And easy going.

249
00:08:15,810 --> 00:08:17,810
Because she's easy going and daring,

250
00:08:17,810 --> 00:08:20,443
she doesn't like things to be stuffy.

251
00:08:21,243 --> 00:08:23,243
So I...

252
00:08:23,243 --> 00:08:26,843
I stressed a lot about this trip.

253
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:30,777
She's anxious.

254
00:08:30,777 --> 00:08:32,510
- Why? / - She looks really anxious.

255
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:34,410
But we have similar personalities.

256
00:08:37,143 --> 00:08:41,310
(Who is her daring partner?)

257
00:08:45,477 --> 00:08:47,910
I'm trembling because I'm nervous.

258
00:08:48,677 --> 00:08:50,410
She looks like she's trembling a lot.

259
00:08:50,410 --> 00:08:52,910
- I was really trembling. / - Does she hit you?

260
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:54,777
- No. / - Why are you trembling so much?

261
00:08:54,777 --> 00:08:56,810
I don't know what to do.

262
00:08:58,243 --> 00:08:59,877
Where is she right now?

263
00:09:00,410 --> 00:09:01,177
Is she here?

264
00:09:01,810 --> 00:09:03,243
She must be here.

265
00:09:03,243 --> 00:09:04,477
She's here, right?

266
00:09:05,277 --> 00:09:06,343
Is she here?

267
00:09:06,343 --> 00:09:07,410
Where is she?

268
00:09:08,210 --> 00:09:09,543
Goodness.

269
00:09:11,710 --> 00:09:12,777
Hello!

270
00:09:13,377 --> 00:09:15,110
She's really running out to welcome her.

271
00:09:15,110 --> 00:09:15,877
Goodness.

272
00:09:15,877 --> 00:09:17,210
They're like mother and daughter.

273
00:09:17,210 --> 00:09:18,077
When did you arrive?

274
00:09:18,077 --> 00:09:19,343
Me?

275
00:09:19,343 --> 00:09:20,877
- Of course I came earlier... / - You're wearing loafers?

276
00:09:20,877 --> 00:09:22,610
- Loafers! / - Why am I still so short?

277
00:09:22,610 --> 00:09:23,843
I feel even shorter.

278
00:09:23,843 --> 00:09:25,610
I'm annoyed. Stand over there.

279
00:09:25,610 --> 00:09:26,277
Let's hold hands.

280
00:09:26,277 --> 00:09:27,843
Hyunjoo is tall.

281
00:09:28,543 --> 00:09:29,177
Should I sit?

282
00:09:29,177 --> 00:09:30,910
Thank you for calling me...

283
00:09:30,910 --> 00:09:32,843
- Hyunjoo. / - Not at all. I've prepared something.

284
00:09:32,843 --> 00:09:33,810
Ma'am.

285
00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:35,877
Have you seen this?

286
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:37,743
No. What is this?

287
00:09:38,377 --> 00:09:39,643
Is this that...

288
00:09:39,643 --> 00:09:42,077
It's the signature item on Battle Trip.

289
00:09:42,077 --> 00:09:45,043
- You carry it around and film like this? / - Yes, like this.

290
00:09:45,043 --> 00:09:46,143
Self-camera.

291
00:09:47,643 --> 00:09:49,477
If you give this to us...

292
00:09:49,477 --> 00:09:51,310
- It won't be good. / - Still.

293
00:09:51,310 --> 00:09:52,943
Okay. I'll do my best.

294
00:09:54,210 --> 00:09:56,610
(So much cuteness)

295
00:09:56,610 --> 00:09:58,943
She really liked that later on.

296
00:09:58,943 --> 00:10:00,110
Ta-da.

297
00:10:01,077 --> 00:10:02,143
Goodness.

298
00:10:02,143 --> 00:10:03,677
- What? / - Ta-da.

299
00:10:04,377 --> 00:10:05,677
Goodness.

300
00:10:05,677 --> 00:10:07,277
- Guide Kong. / - Guide Kong.

301
00:10:07,277 --> 00:10:08,777
- That's very cool. / - Yes...

302
00:10:08,777 --> 00:10:10,510
Guide Kong's Nha Trang Tour.

303
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:12,477
Welcome to the Kong Tour.

304
00:10:13,777 --> 00:10:16,510
- That's awkward. / - It's so unnatural.

305
00:10:17,243 --> 00:10:18,710
She must've studied a lot.

306
00:10:20,443 --> 00:10:22,810
How many countries have you been?

307
00:10:22,810 --> 00:10:23,577
Which countries?

308
00:10:23,577 --> 00:10:25,543
For the show,

309
00:10:25,543 --> 00:10:28,443
I sat down and counted.

310
00:10:28,443 --> 00:10:30,577
Around 24 to 25 countries.

311
00:10:30,577 --> 00:10:33,110
And around 50 regions?

312
00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:33,843
Really?

313
00:10:33,843 --> 00:10:35,677
- 50 cities. / - Japan, China, Hong Kong, Macau...

314
00:10:35,677 --> 00:10:38,543
Vietnam, the Philippines, Mongolia, Thailand, Taiwan,

315
00:10:38,543 --> 00:10:40,510
Australia, New Zealand, Bali, Hawaii,

316
00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:42,477
Fiji, Samoa, Kenya, England,

317
00:10:42,477 --> 00:10:44,243
Germany, France, Spain, Italy,

318
00:10:44,243 --> 00:10:46,410
Switzerland, Czech Republic, Monaco.

319
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:49,310
I have never

320
00:10:49,310 --> 00:10:51,510
been on a package tour.

321
00:10:51,510 --> 00:10:56,010
From the airline to the hotel

322
00:10:56,010 --> 00:10:58,210
to the local destinations...

323
00:10:58,210 --> 00:11:01,477
- I plan them all. / - She's a master traveler.

324
00:11:01,477 --> 00:11:02,677
It's easy if you have...

325
00:11:02,677 --> 00:11:03,377
- Someone like that. / - You need them.

326
00:11:03,377 --> 00:11:04,277
- So good. / - It's comfortable.

327
00:11:04,277 --> 00:11:06,743
- You need to travel with her. / - I have to do it myself.

328
00:11:06,743 --> 00:11:08,043
With language...

329
00:11:08,043 --> 00:11:11,577
I can speak enough to travel without problems.

330
00:11:11,577 --> 00:11:14,077
But with Vietnam or China...

331
00:11:14,077 --> 00:11:15,210
It's a bit...

332
00:11:15,210 --> 00:11:17,210
- It's not easy. / - There's like this card...

333
00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:19,543
For people who travel.

334
00:11:19,543 --> 00:11:22,177
It has pictures and phrases.

335
00:11:22,177 --> 00:11:24,277
So I prepare the picture cards.

336
00:11:24,277 --> 00:11:25,377
She's very meticulous.

337
00:11:25,377 --> 00:11:27,743
She could be a travel guide.

338
00:11:27,743 --> 00:11:30,010
I do want to be a travel guide.

339
00:11:30,010 --> 00:11:32,143
I wanted to be a travel writer as well.

340
00:11:32,143 --> 00:11:33,943
This is my debut as a guide.

341
00:11:35,243 --> 00:11:35,977
Also...

342
00:11:35,977 --> 00:11:37,977
I've prepared a schedule.

343
00:11:38,543 --> 00:11:40,177
- Oh, schedule? / - Yes.

344
00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:45,377
It has to be perfect when you go with a senior.

345
00:11:46,877 --> 00:11:49,177
(Girly at times)

346
00:11:49,177 --> 00:11:50,077
This is nice.

347
00:11:50,077 --> 00:11:51,543
Can't we just stay here?

348
00:11:51,543 --> 00:11:53,377
The fact that they don't give you napkins...

349
00:11:53,377 --> 00:11:54,510
Argh.

350
00:11:54,510 --> 00:11:55,810
Milk!

351
00:11:55,810 --> 00:11:57,010
Are you crazy?

352
00:11:58,543 --> 00:11:59,643
What do we do?

353
00:11:59,643 --> 00:12:01,210
(Two-faced customer, Park Jungsoo)

354
00:12:01,477 --> 00:12:03,410
In Vietnam...

355
00:12:03,410 --> 00:12:05,610
There's a legend that's similar to one in Korea.

356
00:12:05,610 --> 00:12:07,843
I'm really scared.

357
00:12:07,843 --> 00:12:09,077
Please.

358
00:12:09,110 --> 00:12:13,710
(Guide of misfortune, Kong Hyunjoo)

359
00:12:17,710 --> 00:12:19,643
It's so nice here.

360
00:12:19,643 --> 00:12:21,443
- Is that the hot spring? / - Yes.

361
00:12:21,443 --> 00:12:23,477
- Hot spring. / - It's a theme park.

362
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:26,877
Since everything costs so little...

363
00:12:26,877 --> 00:12:29,043
- Order whatever you want. / - Food, food.

364
00:12:29,043 --> 00:12:30,410
I'm going there no matter what.

Let's go!

368
00:12:37,743 --> 00:12:39,877
I really like Guide Kong.

369
00:12:40,243 --> 00:12:46,010
(Korea to Nha Trang, Vietnam)

370
00:12:46,010 --> 00:12:47,810
Guide Kong.

371
00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:50,710
(Is this how you use this?)

372
00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:53,610
What do we ride in?

373
00:12:53,610 --> 00:12:56,810
We can use an airport pickup service.

374
00:12:56,810 --> 00:12:58,810
It's $20, one-way.

375
00:12:58,810 --> 00:13:00,210
Great job.

376
00:13:00,210 --> 00:13:02,377
It's good that I came with you.

377
00:13:02,377 --> 00:13:03,410
Let's go.

378
00:13:04,843 --> 00:13:06,543
Let's leave.

379
00:13:06,543 --> 00:13:09,077
We've arrived at night

380
00:13:09,077 --> 00:13:11,477
and it's so great. I love it.

00:13:12,943 --> 00:13:15,510
- If you use the pickup service... / - Pickup service.

382
00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:18,010
A local service will come and get you.

383
00:13:18,677 --> 00:13:20,210
Wow, so nice.

384
00:13:21,577 --> 00:13:23,710
It's great that I came with you.

385
00:13:24,443 --> 00:13:26,010
The swimming pool is so pretty.

386
00:13:26,010 --> 00:13:27,777
It's so pretty.

387
00:13:27,777 --> 00:13:29,577
Tomorrow night...

388
00:13:29,577 --> 00:13:30,477
Should we go for a swim?

389
00:13:30,477 --> 00:13:31,810
- It feels great just thinking about it. / - Great, right?

390
00:13:31,810 --> 00:13:34,177
That's the swimming pool at our resort.

391
00:13:34,177 --> 00:13:35,477
It was so sick.

392
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:38,043

393
00:13:38,043 --> 00:13:39,577

We'll have the buffet breakfast

399
00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:50,877
and head out quickly.

400
00:13:50,877 --> 00:13:53,077
- Let's walk around the beach. / - Beach? Okay.

401
00:13:53,577 --> 00:13:55,110
Good night, good night.

- You're right in front of the beach? / - Yes!

403
00:13:59,677 --> 00:14:01,877

This beach is so nice.

406
00:14:15,610 --> 00:14:17,110
This place is incredible.

00:14:17,110 --> 00:14:18,443

408
00:14:18,443 --> 00:14:19,843
Vietnam...

409
00:14:19,843 --> 00:14:22,343
It's really clean from up close.

410
00:14:22,343 --> 00:14:24,110
Ma'am.

411
00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:29,643
We are currently at Nha Trang.

412
00:14:29,643 --> 00:14:31,143
She really looks like a guide.

413
00:14:33,377 --> 00:14:34,543
It's called the Naples of Asia,

414
00:14:34,543 --> 00:14:37,477
the Mediterranean of Vietnam.

415
00:14:37,477 --> 00:14:40,310
It's the hidden gem of Vietnam.

416
00:14:40,310 --> 00:14:43,077
What's Nha Trang famous for?

417
00:14:43,077 --> 00:14:44,577
When it comes to Nha Trang...

418
00:14:44,577 --> 00:14:47,543
The beach we're walking along right now...

419
00:14:48,343 --> 00:14:50,977
It's 6km long.

420
00:14:52,177 --> 00:14:53,877
It's really...

421
00:14:53,877 --> 00:14:56,077
It keeps going. I think this is pretty.

422
00:14:56,677 --> 00:14:58,043
I think it's prettier here than Naples.

423
00:14:58,043 --> 00:14:59,743
It's much more tranquil than I expected.

424
00:14:59,743 --> 00:15:01,077
Nha Trang...

425
00:15:01,077 --> 00:15:05,543
It's not a well known vacation spot.

426
00:15:05,543 --> 00:15:06,877
So compared to other areas...

427
00:15:06,877 --> 00:15:09,310
- I love that. / - You can relax and enjoy it.

428
00:15:11,543 --> 00:15:13,843
Why didn't you wear your bathing suit?

429
00:15:13,843 --> 00:15:14,810
- Huh? / - Bathing suit.

430
00:15:14,810 --> 00:15:16,410
- Forget it. / - What?

431
00:15:16,410 --> 00:15:17,843
You need to swim.

432
00:15:17,843 --> 00:15:18,810
No, no, no.

433
00:15:20,243 --> 00:15:21,643
Also, I...

434
00:15:21,643 --> 00:15:23,510
Prepared this especially for you.

435
00:15:23,510 --> 00:15:26,943
A course to conquer the hot springs in Nha Trang.

436
00:15:26,943 --> 00:15:28,577
There are hot springs here?

437
00:15:28,577 --> 00:15:31,743
They're no ordinary hot springs. There are mud ones.

438
00:15:31,743 --> 00:15:34,543
There are natural open air hot springs.

439
00:15:34,543 --> 00:15:36,310
- That's so good. / - Look forward to it.

440
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:39,677
Thank you. You thought of my skin care.

441
00:15:39,677 --> 00:15:42,310
We're going to eat pho now.

442
00:15:42,310 --> 00:15:44,843
- It'll be boring to just go... / - Great.

443
00:15:44,843 --> 00:15:47,510
So we'll head there on a cyclo.

444
00:15:47,510 --> 00:15:49,777
- Great. / - Shall we head off?

445
00:15:51,777 --> 00:15:52,777
Seeing Hyunjoo like this...

446
00:15:52,777 --> 00:15:54,243
You seem like a Vietnamese person.

447
00:15:54,243 --> 00:15:55,343
Yeah.

448
00:15:55,343 --> 00:15:56,610
A Vietnamese beauty.

449
00:16:02,010 --> 00:16:04,643
This is quite fun.

450
00:16:04,643 --> 00:16:05,877
Cyclos...

451
00:16:05,877 --> 00:16:06,910
You must haggle.

452
00:16:08,243 --> 00:16:09,777
How much?

453
00:16:10,643 --> 00:16:12,810
20,000 VND.

454
00:16:12,810 --> 00:16:14,243
One? One?

455
00:16:14,243 --> 00:16:16,177
Hey, Hyunjoo.

456
00:16:16,177 --> 00:16:18,910
Just ride this even if it's expensive. Save elsewhere.

457
00:16:18,910 --> 00:16:21,210
- Just get on. / - Ma'am.

458
00:16:21,210 --> 00:16:22,310
It's only $1.

459
00:16:22,310 --> 00:16:23,177
- Really? / - Yes.

460
00:16:23,177 --> 00:16:24,277
It's only $1.

461
00:16:24,277 --> 00:16:25,377
- Really? / - Yes.

462
00:16:25,377 --> 00:16:26,177
Is that okay?

463
00:16:26,177 --> 00:16:27,510
Wow, get on already.

464
00:16:27,510 --> 00:16:28,310
Okay.

465
00:16:28,310 --> 00:16:29,910
- Okay. / - Yes, okay.

466
00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:31,810
The good thing about Vietnam...

467
00:16:31,810 --> 00:16:33,243
About Nha Trang is that

468
00:16:33,243 --> 00:16:36,110
you can enjoy so much with so little.

469
00:16:36,777 --> 00:16:38,177
It's the best.

470
00:16:38,877 --> 00:16:39,510
Goodness.

471
00:16:39,510 --> 00:16:41,243
When you calculate the exchange rates...

472
00:16:41,243 --> 00:16:44,177
Remove a zero and divide by half.

473
00:16:44,177 --> 00:16:46,477
I went to Vietnam as well

474
00:16:46,477 --> 00:16:48,210
and I was told to haggle.

475
00:16:48,210 --> 00:16:51,410
But it's only like 20, 30 cents.

476
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:53,410
- So you just end up paying. / - I know.

477
00:16:53,410 --> 00:16:55,610
- Let's go. / - Go.

478
00:16:55,610 --> 00:16:56,777
Okay.

479
00:16:59,177 --> 00:17:02,510
I wish we could ride around all day in this cyclo.

480
00:17:03,010 --> 00:17:05,310
This is so nice. It's cool.

481
00:17:05,810 --> 00:17:10,110
The pho place we're going to is really famous

482
00:17:10,110 --> 00:17:11,677
so all the drivers know where it is.

483
00:17:11,677 --> 00:17:13,577
- Really? / - Yes.

484
00:17:13,577 --> 00:17:16,310
The place we're going to is extremely famous.

485
00:17:17,610 --> 00:17:19,110
- Is this it? / - Yes.

486
00:17:19,743 --> 00:17:20,510
Here.

487
00:17:21,310 --> 00:17:23,643
This place...

488
00:17:23,643 --> 00:17:25,810
Is a hidden pho eatery.

489
00:17:27,177 --> 00:17:31,277
(The deep aroma and flavor of beef pho)

490
00:17:31,477 --> 00:17:33,010
It's so good.

491
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:35,110
Vietnamese pho is the best.

492
00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:36,377
It's refreshing.

493
00:17:36,377 --> 00:17:38,410
The broth is extremely refreshing.

494
00:17:38,410 --> 00:17:40,310
At this place...

495
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:42,843
The menu is just like that.

496
00:17:43,943 --> 00:17:45,510
Large or small.

497
00:17:45,510 --> 00:17:46,677
- Not much to choose? / - They only have one menu.

498
00:17:46,677 --> 00:17:48,277
That's usually the case with famous places.

499
00:17:48,677 --> 00:17:50,010
Hey...

500
00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:53,443
- The large one is 50,000 VND. / - Yes, 50,000.

501
00:17:53,443 --> 00:17:56,010
The small one is 45,000 VND.

502
00:17:56,010 --> 00:17:57,977
To calculate into dollars...

503
00:17:57,977 --> 00:18:00,143
Remove a zero.

504
00:18:01,043 --> 00:18:02,643
- Then divide by two, right? / - Yes.

505
00:18:02,643 --> 00:18:04,243
- That means... / - You divide by half.

506
00:18:04,243 --> 00:18:06,077
Is that $2.50 then?

507
00:18:06,077 --> 00:18:08,443
- The large one is $2.50. / - 25 cents?

508
00:18:08,443 --> 00:18:10,943
- $2.25, $2.50. / - That's right.

509
00:18:10,943 --> 00:18:11,843
It's extremely cheap.

510
00:18:11,843 --> 00:18:14,077
Isn't it better to eat the large then?

511
00:18:14,077 --> 00:18:15,877
- It's only $2.50? / - Yes.

512
00:18:16,777 --> 00:18:19,743
The two of us can eat our fill for $4.50.

513
00:18:19,743 --> 00:18:21,810
That's two bowls of pho.

514
00:18:21,810 --> 00:18:22,577
Okay, pho.

515
00:18:22,577 --> 00:18:24,443
I like pho.

516
00:18:24,443 --> 00:18:25,343
- Let's eat it. / - Okay.

517
00:18:25,343 --> 00:18:26,777
Lots of coriander for you?

518
00:18:28,243 --> 00:18:30,210
You can ask for it if you can say it in Vietnamese.

519
00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:32,410
- Just a little coriander for me. / - Okay then.

520
00:18:32,410 --> 00:18:34,510
- What I'll do is... / - You ask for a lot.

521
00:18:34,510 --> 00:18:36,310
Ta-da. I've prepared this.

522
00:18:36,310 --> 00:18:37,477
Ta-da. I've prepared this.

523
00:18:37,477 --> 00:18:40,243
If you prepare pictures in advance,

524
00:18:40,243 --> 00:18:41,677
it's easy to communicate.

525
00:18:44,177 --> 00:18:45,210
No.

526
00:18:45,210 --> 00:18:46,477
Are you saying hello?

527
00:18:46,477 --> 00:18:48,277
No, that is...

528
00:18:48,277 --> 00:18:50,177
- Hello, coriander. / - She understood.

529
00:18:50,177 --> 00:18:50,843

- Lots for me. / - No.

A lot.

532
00:18:55,577 --> 00:18:56,377
Okay?

533
00:18:58,010 --> 00:19:01,143
It's so convenient to have this.

534
00:19:01,143 --> 00:19:03,477
- You brought that for me, right? / - Yes.

535
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:06,643
Wow, looks delicious.

536
00:19:12,877 --> 00:19:14,077
Oh, that looks so good.

537
00:19:14,077 --> 00:19:15,243
It was so good.

538
00:19:15,243 --> 00:19:17,010
- Try it. / - The visuals...

539
00:19:17,010 --> 00:19:19,177
It's so well presented and looks delicious.

540
00:19:19,177 --> 00:19:20,343
You're right.

541
00:19:23,943 --> 00:19:25,577
(Ah)

542
00:19:25,577 --> 00:19:27,143
- How is it? / - It's so good.

543
00:19:27,143 --> 00:19:29,077
- Really? / - It's so good.

544
00:19:29,077 --> 00:19:29,977
Seriously...

545
00:19:29,977 --> 00:19:33,443
- I just want one spoonful of the broth. / - No...

546
00:19:33,443 --> 00:19:36,043
- You need the hot sauce. / - You need it.

547
00:19:36,043 --> 00:19:37,543
What is it?

548
00:19:37,543 --> 00:19:38,543
- Lime? / - The chili peppers.

549
00:19:38,543 --> 00:19:40,443
Squeeze in some lime and add plenty of peppers.

550
00:19:41,777 --> 00:19:43,443
I'm drooling again.

551
00:19:44,377 --> 00:19:46,010
That looks so good.

552
00:19:46,010 --> 00:19:47,610
It really makes you salivate.

553
00:19:56,043 --> 00:19:57,543
It's really like...

554
00:19:57,543 --> 00:20:00,143
The pho you have at the place of origin.

555
00:20:00,143 --> 00:20:03,277
It tastes lighter than the pho in Korea.

556
00:20:03,277 --> 00:20:04,777
Yes, it's clean.

557
00:20:04,777 --> 00:20:07,810
Right, it tastes clean. It's not greasy.

558
00:20:07,810 --> 00:20:09,977
It tastes lighter.

559
00:20:10,977 --> 00:20:12,410
(What is this?)

560
00:20:13,143 --> 00:20:14,977
Is this the thing we add in?

561
00:20:15,810 --> 00:20:16,810
The spicy thing?

562
00:20:17,943 --> 00:20:19,410
- For me... / - Just add it all!

563
00:20:19,410 --> 00:20:20,777
- For me... / - Just add it all!

564
00:20:22,077 --> 00:20:23,243
Just add everything.

565
00:20:23,243 --> 00:20:24,477
That's really spicy.

566
00:20:26,143 --> 00:20:28,010
- Add it all. / - You like spicy food, right?

567
00:20:28,010 --> 00:20:29,310
Yeah, I like spicy food.

568
00:20:30,343 --> 00:20:31,743
I didn't add any coriander...

569
00:20:32,110 --> 00:20:34,677
(Did it succeed in captivating her taste bud?)

570
00:20:35,743 --> 00:20:37,777
It's not overbearing.

571
00:20:37,777 --> 00:20:39,077
It's so good.

572
00:20:39,677 --> 00:20:42,543
It's kind of like rib soup in Korea.

573
00:20:42,543 --> 00:20:44,977
I'd like mine to be spicier.

574
00:20:45,843 --> 00:20:46,743
You're adding more?

575
00:20:47,610 --> 00:20:49,043
She wants it spicier.

576
00:20:49,043 --> 00:20:51,610
It wasn't that spicy. It was really good.

577
00:20:51,610 --> 00:20:52,677
It was so good.

578
00:20:52,677 --> 00:20:54,610
If you really like spicy food...

579
00:20:54,610 --> 00:20:56,277
I'm starting to sweat here.

580
00:20:58,543 --> 00:20:59,410
Ma'am, the broth...

581
00:20:59,410 --> 00:21:01,877
It's starting to look like instant noodle broth.

582
00:21:04,177 --> 00:21:04,910
Is it good?

583
00:21:06,510 --> 00:21:07,810
Isn't that too spicy?

584
00:21:07,810 --> 00:21:10,010
Isn't there more sauce than broth now?

585
00:21:11,610 --> 00:21:13,343
I'd like to ask for more broth.

586
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:18,677
That looks good.

587
00:21:18,677 --> 00:21:20,777
- You'd drool watching that... / - It was really good.

588
00:21:21,443 --> 00:21:23,010
The viewers must be cooking instant noodles now.

589
00:21:24,677 --> 00:21:25,610
Isn't it spicy?

590
00:21:26,310 --> 00:21:28,243
- I like it. / - You like it?

591
00:21:28,243 --> 00:21:30,277
In my throat...

592
00:21:32,177 --> 00:21:34,010
- With this... / - Milk!

593
00:21:34,010 --> 00:21:35,343
Milk!

594
00:21:35,343 --> 00:21:36,643
It's spicy.

595
00:21:36,643 --> 00:21:37,810
It is spicy for her.

596
00:21:39,143 --> 00:21:40,477
Milk!

597
00:21:40,477 --> 00:21:41,877
Milk!

598
00:21:41,877 --> 00:21:43,377
It's too spicy!

599
00:21:44,810 --> 00:21:46,177
So spicy.

600
00:21:47,177 --> 00:21:49,643
Don't my eyes look weird because it's too spicy?

601
00:21:49,643 --> 00:21:52,177
She's really daring with food too.

602
00:21:52,177 --> 00:21:54,310
It's a charming kind of spiciness.

603
00:21:54,877 --> 00:21:57,010
It felt like she was eating a punishment meal.

604
00:21:57,010 --> 00:21:59,777
- She really likes pungent foods. / - She likes it strong.

605
00:21:59,777 --> 00:22:01,643
It's too spicy.

606
00:22:01,643 --> 00:22:03,243
How will you eat this?

607
00:22:03,243 --> 00:22:06,077
But it's nice that I'm sweating. It's refreshing.

608
00:22:09,010 --> 00:22:13,110
This is the first restaurant you've taken me to...

609
00:22:13,110 --> 00:22:15,810
- After we arrived in Nha Trang. / - Yes.

610
00:22:15,810 --> 00:22:16,943
Do you like it?

611
00:22:16,943 --> 00:22:17,843
I do like it

612
00:22:17,843 --> 00:22:19,677
and it's having a huge impact.

613
00:22:19,677 --> 00:22:20,743
- Really? / - Yes.

614
00:22:20,743 --> 00:22:22,277
- From now... / - The spiciness.

615
00:22:22,277 --> 00:22:25,010
You're the one who made it spicy.

616
00:22:26,810 --> 00:22:29,410
We're going to a hot spring later.

617
00:22:30,177 --> 00:22:32,243
- Okay. / - So eat up.

618
00:22:32,243 --> 00:22:34,177
Then we shouldn't eat too much.

619
00:22:34,177 --> 00:22:36,210
- Since we're going into hot water. / - Yes.

620
00:22:37,743 --> 00:22:39,743
She's sweating before she reaches the hot spring.

621
00:22:39,743 --> 00:22:41,443
On the first day...

622
00:22:41,443 --> 00:22:44,677
We're going to hot spring with a special theme.

623
00:22:45,010 --> 00:22:46,610
Recently with my mom,

624
00:22:46,610 --> 00:22:49,143
I visited the Daegwallyeong Sheep Ranch.

625
00:22:49,143 --> 00:22:50,977
She loved it.

626
00:22:50,977 --> 00:22:52,910
It was like going back to her childhood.

627
00:22:52,910 --> 00:22:54,943
Enjoying the animals and nature...

628
00:22:54,943 --> 00:22:56,977
I thought she'd really like it.

629
00:22:56,977 --> 00:23:00,577
It'd be nice to see rare animals and

630
00:23:00,577 --> 00:23:02,210
when you get tired,

631
00:23:02,210 --> 00:23:04,377
it'd be nice to hit the hot springs.

632
00:23:04,377 --> 00:23:07,510
So I'll take her there for the hot springs...

633
00:23:07,510 --> 00:23:11,143
Since I've traveled with my mom before...

634
00:23:11,143 --> 00:23:14,810
- I had an idea of what mothers like. / - You'd know.

635
00:23:15,677 --> 00:23:18,543
(5 ways to enjoy Nha Trang, Yang Bay Eco Park)

636
00:23:19,777 --> 00:23:23,710
Yang Bay is really charming.

637
00:23:23,710 --> 00:23:25,343
Where is this place?

638
00:23:25,343 --> 00:23:27,677
It's called Yang Bay.

- Everything in here without further pay. / - $40?

646
00:23:44,543 --> 00:23:45,410
That's expensive.

- That's... / - The entrance fee?

648
00:23:46,410 --> 00:23:49,077
Yes, it includes lunch

649

and a pickup service.

650
00:23:51,077 --> 00:23:52,277
Everything.

651

The entrance fee is $7.50.

652
00:23:53,943 --> 00:23:55,210
- Guide Kong. / - Yes.

653
00:23:55,210 --> 00:23:56,410
What is that tree?

654
00:23:56,410 --> 00:23:56,977
That tree...

655
00:23:56,977 --> 00:24:00,310
- It looks special. / - It's a special tree.

656
00:24:00,310 --> 00:24:03,010
You can make a wish and hang it.

657
00:24:03,010 --> 00:24:04,377
Since it's the end of year,

658
00:24:04,377 --> 00:24:07,943
how about we make a new year's wish?

659
00:24:12,143 --> 00:24:13,043
The fun thing is,

660
00:24:13,043 --> 00:24:17,443
you use a slingshot to hang the wishes.

661
00:24:17,443 --> 00:24:18,377
- Let's try it. / - Slingshot?

662
00:24:18,377 --> 00:24:19,277
Yes.

663
00:24:19,277 --> 00:24:20,910
You hit the tree with a slingshot?

664
00:24:20,910 --> 00:24:22,677
Yes, that's how you hang it.

665
00:24:22,677 --> 00:24:23,210
Try it.

666
00:24:23,210 --> 00:24:25,110
That's interesting. Okay.

667
00:24:25,110 --> 00:24:26,210
Okay.

668
00:24:26,210 --> 00:24:29,543
(The wish tree that will grant the new year's wish)

669
00:24:32,777 --> 00:24:36,910
(They write their wishes on the ribbon)

670
00:24:40,410 --> 00:24:41,577
You have to hang it high.

671
00:24:42,410 --> 00:24:44,977
(With the hope that their wishes will come true)

672
00:24:44,977 --> 00:24:45,943
(Jungsoo fails)

673
00:24:45,943 --> 00:24:47,077
- Goodness. / - Oh, my. Oh, my.

674
00:24:47,077 --> 00:24:48,277
It's not easy.

675
00:24:50,077 --> 00:24:52,343
(Jungsoo fails)

676
00:24:52,343 --> 00:24:55,110
- Will it work? / - This isn't so easy.

677
00:24:55,110 --> 00:24:56,810
You didn't trick me, did you?

678
00:24:58,243 --> 00:24:59,910
You didn't trick me, did you?

679
00:25:03,377 --> 00:25:05,510
How do you hang this? It won't work.

680
00:25:06,543 --> 00:25:09,477
- It won't hit. It pops out. / - It won't.

681
00:25:09,477 --> 00:25:11,310
It's supposed to latch on.

682
00:25:11,310 --> 00:25:12,977
That's right.

683
00:25:16,177 --> 00:25:17,910
Argh!

684
00:25:17,910 --> 00:25:19,443
Was that Vietnamese? Argh?

685
00:25:24,877 --> 00:25:25,710
Did you get it?

686
00:25:31,577 --> 00:25:33,810
- I think it'll work... / - It stuck to the top.

687
00:25:33,810 --> 00:25:36,810
- Doesn't it work? / - It's a tree...

688
00:25:36,810 --> 00:25:39,110
You have to shoot it where it'll hang...

689
00:25:39,110 --> 00:25:41,043
It wasn't easy.

690
00:25:41,043 --> 00:25:43,410
- Shoot it high. / - Why you...

691
00:25:43,410 --> 00:25:45,643
Hey! This tree...

692
00:25:47,010 --> 00:25:47,877
This tree...

693
00:25:49,877 --> 00:25:52,810
Mine wouldn't stick but Hyunjoo's did.

694
00:25:52,810 --> 00:25:54,143
You'd feel so sorry...

695
00:25:54,143 --> 00:25:56,477
- Mine worked first so... / - I know.

696
00:25:56,477 --> 00:25:57,710
The guide made a mistake.

697
00:25:57,710 --> 00:25:58,443
Why did you do that?

698
00:25:58,443 --> 00:25:59,343
- Mine caught on. / - So tactless.

699
00:25:59,343 --> 00:26:01,143
You should've done it later.

700
00:26:01,143 --> 00:26:02,210
- Really? / - Ma'am.

701
00:26:03,977 --> 00:26:05,210
- Failed again? / - Oh, no.

702
00:26:08,943 --> 00:26:10,443
This program, today...

703
00:26:10,443 --> 00:26:13,777
We won't be moving on until I get this.

704
00:26:13,777 --> 00:26:14,410
Just so you know.

705
00:26:14,410 --> 00:26:16,143
It'd be so funny if she did it until sunset.

706
00:26:17,377 --> 00:26:18,943
- Just keeps going? / - I told you.

707
00:26:18,943 --> 00:26:21,310
If you fire it this way from up close...

708
00:26:22,443 --> 00:26:24,643
Guide Kong, don't excite me. Stay still.

709
00:26:25,177 --> 00:26:28,177
I've put everything on the line for this.

710
00:26:29,077 --> 00:26:30,210
Next year...

711
00:26:31,477 --> 00:26:32,743
- If she shot with more power. / - Why won't it work?

712
00:26:32,743 --> 00:26:35,077
I'm getting really angry now.

713
00:26:37,043 --> 00:26:39,910
I went right up to the tree and it still didn't work.

714
00:26:39,910 --> 00:26:41,977
- Isn't that cheating? / - Want me to do it for you?

715
00:26:41,977 --> 00:26:43,810
- It still didn't work. / - Please!

716
00:26:45,343 --> 00:26:47,177
I climbed the tree.

717
00:26:47,177 --> 00:26:48,743
I actually hung it myself.

718
00:26:51,177 --> 00:26:52,643
- Hey. / - Yes?

719
00:26:52,643 --> 00:26:54,177
This is the best I can do.

720
00:26:54,177 --> 00:26:55,143
I'm so angry.

721
00:26:55,143 --> 00:26:58,110
- So long as you hang it. / - That's right.

722
00:26:59,343 --> 00:27:01,543
(We hope your wish comes true)

723
00:27:03,043 --> 00:27:06,410

724
00:27:08,610 --> 00:27:11,077
Come here. It's over here.

725
00:27:13,410 --> 00:27:14,910
Oh, there...

726
00:27:15,977 --> 00:27:17,010
Oh, no!

727
00:27:20,910 --> 00:27:22,077
What's going on?

728
00:27:26,377 --> 00:27:27,877
There we go, there we go.

729
00:27:27,877 --> 00:27:28,743
Oh, my, oh, my, oh, my.

730
00:27:28,743 --> 00:27:30,177
- Oh, carp! / - They're carp.

731
00:27:30,177 --> 00:27:31,677
- Here, here, here. / - Over there...

732
00:27:31,677 --> 00:27:33,877
The carp are fed with bottles.

733
00:27:35,377 --> 00:27:36,543
That looks scary.

734
00:27:36,543 --> 00:27:37,810
That's cute.

735
00:27:37,810 --> 00:27:38,910
They suck on it?

736
00:27:38,910 --> 00:27:40,343
I'm so scared.

737
00:27:40,977 --> 00:27:42,577
- Nice, right? / - I'm scared.

738
00:27:45,010 --> 00:27:46,443
Oh, no.

739
00:27:54,810 --> 00:27:56,510
I normally don't get scared like this.

740
00:28:00,143 --> 00:28:03,577
(Meanwhile, Madam Jungsoo)

741
00:28:03,577 --> 00:28:05,810
(Is giving out love evenly to all)

742
00:28:05,810 --> 00:28:07,643
There you go, there you go.

743
00:28:07,643 --> 00:28:08,843
There, there.

744
00:28:10,343 --> 00:28:12,777
(So many fish)

745
00:28:13,443 --> 00:28:14,443
There you go.

746
00:28:16,777 --> 00:28:18,310
- They eating so well. / - They're sucking on it.

747
00:28:18,310 --> 00:28:19,543
My goodness.

748
00:28:19,543 --> 00:28:20,943
- Goodness. / - That's fascinating.

749
00:28:24,977 --> 00:28:27,210
They're not scared of people.

750
00:28:27,210 --> 00:28:27,677
They're...

751
00:28:27,677 --> 00:28:29,410
- What was that? / - It jumped out.

752
00:28:29,410 --> 00:28:30,610
Are you insane?

753
00:28:31,743 --> 00:28:33,077
Did you just get mad at a carp?

754
00:28:33,077 --> 00:28:34,243
- Are you insane? / - Are you insane?

755
00:28:35,077 --> 00:28:35,710
Thing is...

756
00:28:35,710 --> 00:28:37,010
That sounded like a line from a drama.

757
00:28:38,577 --> 00:28:39,610
Are you insane?

758
00:28:40,843 --> 00:28:41,777
They ate it all.

759
00:28:41,777 --> 00:28:42,943
All done.

760
00:28:42,943 --> 00:28:44,110
They ate it all.

761
00:28:47,843 --> 00:28:49,410
What's wrong with you?

762
00:28:50,210 --> 00:28:51,343
This is

763
00:28:51,343 --> 00:28:54,343
the difference between a mother and a single lady.

764
00:28:54,343 --> 00:28:56,210
That was fun.

765
00:28:56,210 --> 00:28:58,343
We'll go in there.

766
00:28:58,343 --> 00:29:00,443
Do you want to feed a crocodile?

767
00:29:00,443 --> 00:29:01,477
Yes, let's try it.

768
00:29:02,477 --> 00:29:03,877
(1. Wish tree, 2. Feeding carp)

769
00:29:03,877 --> 00:29:06,010
(3. Feeding crocodiles)

770
00:29:07,343 --> 00:29:08,243
Oh, this.

771
00:29:08,943 --> 00:29:11,643
That was scary. It's alive.

772
00:29:11,643 --> 00:29:14,077
(A tough leather back)

773
00:29:14,077 --> 00:29:17,177
(Sharp teeth and exceptional hunting skills)

774
00:29:21,477 --> 00:29:24,043
(Welcome)

775
00:29:24,843 --> 00:29:25,743
Over there, over there.

776
00:29:25,743 --> 00:29:27,510
Do you see the crocodile?

777
00:29:27,510 --> 00:29:28,443
It's here.

778
00:29:29,310 --> 00:29:30,343
There are so many.

779
00:29:30,343 --> 00:29:32,143
It's too expensive to feed the crocodiles.

780
00:29:32,143 --> 00:29:33,410
It's 50 cents.

781
00:29:34,310 --> 00:29:36,010
Are these crocodiles grown for eating?

782
00:29:36,010 --> 00:29:37,877
They look so tender and delicious.

783
00:29:40,410 --> 00:29:42,310
They didn't look very tough,

784
00:29:42,310 --> 00:29:44,510
they looked really tender.

785
00:29:44,510 --> 00:29:46,243
Are these crocodiles grown for eating?

786
00:29:46,243 --> 00:29:48,310
They look so tender and delicious.

787
00:29:48,310 --> 00:29:49,410
No.

788
00:29:50,210 --> 00:29:53,410
(They attempt to feed the crocodiles)

789
00:29:53,943 --> 00:29:54,777
Goodness.

790
00:29:55,543 --> 00:29:58,143
They look like floating logs.

791
00:30:01,077 --> 00:30:02,610
They stay still

792
00:30:02,610 --> 00:30:05,110
then just bite out of nowhere.

793
00:30:05,110 --> 00:30:06,143
It looks scary.

794
00:30:07,643 --> 00:30:10,743
I'm going to faint because of your screams.

795
00:30:13,010 --> 00:30:14,143
(Chomp)

796
00:30:15,243 --> 00:30:16,877
(Steal)

797
00:30:17,810 --> 00:30:19,943
Darn, it ate it!

798
00:30:19,943 --> 00:30:21,543
I was trying to hoist it

799
00:30:21,543 --> 00:30:23,077
and they cut it off.

800
00:30:23,077 --> 00:30:24,310
- Goodness. / - Oh, my.

801
00:30:24,310 --> 00:30:25,810
They ate it.

802
00:30:26,910 --> 00:30:28,943
(Only Guide Kong is left with feed)

803
00:30:32,677 --> 00:30:33,543
It bit it.

804
00:30:33,543 --> 00:30:34,510
It bit it. Pull, pull.

805
00:30:34,510 --> 00:30:36,277
Lift it up.

806
00:30:36,277 --> 00:30:37,043
It bit it.

807
00:30:37,043 --> 00:30:37,977
It bit it. Pull, pull.

808
00:30:37,977 --> 00:30:39,677
Lift it up.

809
00:30:40,443 --> 00:30:41,577
Lift.

810
00:30:41,577 --> 00:30:43,077
Good, good.

811
00:30:43,077 --> 00:30:45,043
It's scarier when you lift it up.

812
00:30:45,943 --> 00:30:47,843
It's better when they're in the water.

813
00:30:48,977 --> 00:30:51,110
Can't we try one more time?

814
00:30:51,110 --> 00:30:51,843
Guide Kong?

815
00:30:51,843 --> 00:30:53,843
Are you trying to catch one?

816
00:30:53,843 --> 00:30:55,743
I want to catch just one.

817
00:30:56,577 --> 00:30:57,643
- One more time? / - Yeah.

818
00:30:57,643 --> 00:30:58,277
Once more?

819
00:30:58,277 --> 00:30:59,977
It's such a shame.

820
00:30:59,977 --> 00:31:00,410
Not yet...

821
00:31:00,410 --> 00:31:03,877
- Jungsoo is really competitive. / - Yes.

822
00:31:05,210 --> 00:31:06,943
I'm so scared.

823
00:31:11,843 --> 00:31:13,610
It's really thrilling.

824
00:31:16,210 --> 00:31:19,510
(A battle with the crocodiles)

825
00:31:20,677 --> 00:31:23,377
She keeps snatching it to try and catch them.

826
00:31:23,377 --> 00:31:24,643
I think that day was

827
00:31:24,643 --> 00:31:27,077
the day the crocodiles were the angriest.

828
00:31:29,277 --> 00:31:33,610
(All eyes on the feed)

829
00:31:35,177 --> 00:31:37,443
Their eyes look closed but they're all watching.

830
00:31:37,443 --> 00:31:38,377
Bite it.

831
00:31:39,343 --> 00:31:40,243
That'd be more fun than fishing.

832
00:31:40,243 --> 00:31:42,210
It's going to break a tooth.

833
00:31:43,577 --> 00:31:46,210
Who's faster? You or me?

834
00:31:46,210 --> 00:31:47,110
Darn it!

835
00:31:47,810 --> 00:31:48,710
Darn it!

836
00:31:50,543 --> 00:31:51,443
Hey!

837
00:31:54,110 --> 00:31:56,643
Fine, I lose. I give up.

838
00:31:56,643 --> 00:31:57,510
You can eat it all.

839
00:31:58,110 --> 00:31:59,277
- Ma'am... / - Happy, right?

840
00:31:59,277 --> 00:32:00,110
Bye.

841
00:32:00,710 --> 00:32:02,143
(Thanks for the food)

842
00:32:03,243 --> 00:32:04,477
Crocodile, are you insane?

843
00:32:08,177 --> 00:32:10,443
When I raised it, its teeth...

844
00:32:10,443 --> 00:32:11,243
That sound.

845
00:32:13,877 --> 00:32:17,243
(What did Guide Kong see?)

846
00:32:17,810 --> 00:32:19,310
Is that a real crocodile?

847
00:32:19,310 --> 00:32:20,377
- It must be real. / - Don't be like that.

848
00:32:20,377 --> 00:32:21,977
- It's real. / - It's alive?

849
00:32:21,977 --> 00:32:23,343
Is that a real crocodile?

850
00:32:23,343 --> 00:32:24,643
- It must be real. / - Don't be like that.

851
00:32:24,643 --> 00:32:25,743
- It's real. / - It's alive?

852
00:32:25,743 --> 00:32:26,810
Darn it.

853
00:32:28,410 --> 00:32:29,243
Hey!

854
00:32:29,843 --> 00:32:31,643
Aren't they being raised to be eaten?

855
00:32:31,643 --> 00:32:33,243
They look so tender and tasty.

856
00:32:34,943 --> 00:32:37,610
(She's face to face with a crocodile)

857
00:32:39,343 --> 00:32:41,477
What will we do?

858
00:32:41,477 --> 00:32:42,710
Please.

859
00:32:46,743 --> 00:32:48,177
- She has no fear. / - She's fearless.

860
00:32:48,177 --> 00:32:49,310
She's touching the crocodile.

861
00:32:49,310 --> 00:32:50,710
It's fine.

862
00:32:50,710 --> 00:32:51,843
It's alive.

863
00:32:53,143 --> 00:32:55,277
- It's for taking photos. / - Please, please.

864
00:32:55,277 --> 00:32:58,443
It's really warm.

865
00:32:58,443 --> 00:32:58,843
Hey.

866
00:32:58,843 --> 00:33:01,077
Its claws are digging into your skin. Are you okay?

867
00:33:02,243 --> 00:33:03,943
(Grabs)

868
00:33:05,177 --> 00:33:06,643
I'm so scared.

869
00:33:06,643 --> 00:33:07,810
This guy...

870
00:33:07,810 --> 00:33:10,343
His neck is moving.

871
00:33:10,343 --> 00:33:13,543
- He's breathing. / - I was completely frozen.

872
00:33:14,577 --> 00:33:15,877
Ma'am...

873
00:33:15,877 --> 00:33:17,543
1, 2,

874
00:33:17,543 --> 00:33:18,310
3

875
00:33:21,243 --> 00:33:23,043
That's not a genuine smile.

876
00:33:25,243 --> 00:33:26,210
She's frozen with fear.

877
00:33:26,210 --> 00:33:27,977
- That's not a genuine smile. / - Nice photo though.

878
00:33:28,543 --> 00:33:31,277
What are we going to do now?

879
00:33:31,277 --> 00:33:32,710
Now...

880
00:33:33,477 --> 00:33:36,043
- Let's climb up. / - Shall we go to the hot spring?

881
00:33:36,043 --> 00:33:38,177
Okay. Let's go.

882
00:33:39,643 --> 00:33:41,643
So you've enjoyed the park

883
00:33:41,643 --> 00:33:42,677
before the hot spring,

884
00:33:42,677 --> 00:33:44,477
with all the animals, right?

885
00:33:45,677 --> 00:33:49,943
(5 ways to enjoy Nha Trang, Yang Bay hot spring)

886
00:33:49,943 --> 00:33:51,910
- It's a forest. / - It's a natural...

887
00:33:51,910 --> 00:33:54,210
Open air hot spring.

888
00:33:54,210 --> 00:33:56,943
- This place is called Yang Bay, right? / - Yeah.

889
00:33:56,943 --> 00:34:00,710
Yang means heaven.

890
00:34:00,710 --> 00:34:02,810
And bay means water.

891
00:34:02,810 --> 00:34:03,810
So it's heavenly water.

892
00:34:04,510 --> 00:34:07,010
The people of Nha Trang

893
00:34:07,010 --> 00:34:09,710
believe this water is very sacred.

894
00:34:09,710 --> 00:34:11,410
Really? Wow, check out that water.

895
00:34:11,410 --> 00:34:13,977
I was scared when we crossed that bridge.

896
00:34:13,977 --> 00:34:16,177
She's scared of everything.

897
00:34:17,510 --> 00:34:19,243
So you weren't holding on for Jungsoo's sake.

898
00:34:19,243 --> 00:34:20,410
You were holding on to her back, right?

899
00:34:20,410 --> 00:34:21,810
I was holding on tight.

900
00:34:33,310 --> 00:34:35,277
Is hot spring water good for you?

901
00:34:35,277 --> 00:34:37,810
It doesn't feel soft.

902
00:34:37,810 --> 00:34:39,410
It doesn't seem to have any sulfur.

903
00:34:39,410 --> 00:34:43,777
This hot spring water is close to the sea.

904
00:34:43,777 --> 00:34:46,110
It's high in salinity and minerals.

905
00:34:46,110 --> 00:34:47,443
Good for skin recovery,

906
00:34:47,443 --> 00:34:50,243
circulation, and skin beauty.

907
00:34:53,177 --> 00:34:57,810
But we sweat it out doing activities earlier

908
00:34:57,810 --> 00:35:00,310
so it's really nice being in warm water

909
00:35:00,310 --> 00:35:01,410
with the rain falling on us.

910
00:35:05,077 --> 00:35:05,877
That day...

911
00:35:05,877 --> 00:35:07,010
- It rained a lot. / - Isn't it warm?

912
00:35:07,010 --> 00:35:08,043
- Isn't it warm? / - It's not warm.

913
00:35:08,043 --> 00:35:09,743
- It was around 35℃. / - That day...

914
00:35:09,743 --> 00:35:13,277
- The rained cooled the spring. / - The rain...

915
00:35:13,277 --> 00:35:15,410
In the rain...

916
00:35:15,410 --> 00:35:17,343
Sitting in warm water in the rain...

917
00:35:17,343 --> 00:35:19,343
You know that feeling?

918
00:35:19,343 --> 00:35:21,910
- Being warm in the rain. / - It's so nice.

919
00:35:21,910 --> 00:35:24,477
- That'd be so nice. / - I was worried by the rain...

920
00:35:24,477 --> 00:35:27,643
She's learned how to swim. She looks professional.

921
00:35:27,643 --> 00:35:29,643
- She's learned it properly. / - That's true.

922
00:35:32,943 --> 00:35:34,443
Are you happy?

923
00:35:35,077 --> 00:35:37,043
(This is the best)

924
00:35:37,043 --> 00:35:38,677
You can enter the stream

925
00:35:38,677 --> 00:35:40,777
and swim in there as well.

926
00:35:41,710 --> 00:35:43,443
This is so nice.

927
00:35:43,443 --> 00:35:44,777
This is great.

928
00:35:46,143 --> 00:35:47,977
This is really nice.

929
00:35:49,077 --> 00:35:51,777
- I was worried. / - You can stop filming now.

930
00:35:51,777 --> 00:35:54,143
We'll hang out a bit more here...

931
00:35:54,143 --> 00:35:55,710
By ourselves.

932
00:35:58,077 --> 00:35:59,410
There must be a variety of pools.

933
00:35:59,410 --> 00:36:01,110
Yes, there were round springs

934
00:36:01,110 --> 00:36:03,177
and ones over there. There were a few.

935
00:36:03,177 --> 00:36:05,977
The important thing about hot spring water

936
00:36:05,977 --> 00:36:08,243
is that it gets tiring when you take a hot bath.

937
00:36:08,243 --> 00:36:08,943
- Yes. / - Right.

938
00:36:08,943 --> 00:36:11,210
But when you go in a hot spring filled with minerals,

939
00:36:11,210 --> 00:36:13,143
even though it's hot, your body...

940
00:36:13,143 --> 00:36:14,177
- That's right. / - It relaxes.

941
00:36:14,177 --> 00:36:15,877
- The fatigue drains away. / - It feels different...

942
00:36:15,877 --> 00:36:17,443
To the tap water.

943
00:36:17,443 --> 00:36:19,243
It's all absorbed into your body.

944
00:36:20,043 --> 00:36:22,810
If we just go where everyone goes,

945
00:36:22,810 --> 00:36:23,977
it'd be boring.

946
00:36:23,977 --> 00:36:26,110
So there's a really famous

947
00:36:26,110 --> 00:36:28,677
restaurant loved by the locals.

948
00:36:28,677 --> 00:36:31,543
It doesn't even have an English menu. It's local.

949
00:36:31,543 --> 00:36:34,610
I wanted to show Jungsoo

950
00:36:34,610 --> 00:36:36,977
what the locals enjoy.

951
00:36:36,977 --> 00:36:40,477
So I chose a special place for the first dinner.

952
00:36:41,210 --> 00:36:43,543
(5 ways to enjoy Nha Trang, bo lac)

953
00:36:45,377 --> 00:36:49,443
(A popular restaurant among locals)

954
00:36:51,510 --> 00:36:53,010
This is a famous place?

955
00:36:53,010 --> 00:36:55,543
They don't even have an English menu.

956
00:36:55,543 --> 00:36:58,010
The tourists don't know about it.

957
00:36:58,010 --> 00:37:00,077
It's a Vietnamese local eatery.

958
00:37:00,077 --> 00:37:01,677
What's good here?

959
00:37:01,677 --> 00:37:04,243
The best dish here

960
00:37:04,243 --> 00:37:06,377
is this bo lac.

961
00:37:06,377 --> 00:37:07,677
Bo means beef.

962
00:37:07,677 --> 00:37:09,877
And lac means shake.

963
00:37:09,877 --> 00:37:11,943
They shake the beef in a pot.

964
00:37:11,943 --> 00:37:14,710
If you eat it with banh mi,

965
00:37:14,710 --> 00:37:16,310
it's really delicious.

966
00:37:16,310 --> 00:37:18,310
They call baguettes

967
00:37:18,310 --> 00:37:19,610
banh mi over there.

968
00:37:19,610 --> 00:37:22,277
That's because of their colonization influence.

969
00:37:22,277 --> 00:37:23,777
- France. / - The French...

970
00:37:23,777 --> 00:37:25,743
They needed their baguettes but they didn't have any

971
00:37:25,743 --> 00:37:27,177
so they made it with local ingredients.

972
00:37:27,177 --> 00:37:28,677
- Oh, really? / - Yes.

973
00:37:28,677 --> 00:37:30,610
Vietnamese food

974
00:37:30,610 --> 00:37:31,710
has less calories than you'd think.

975
00:37:31,710 --> 00:37:32,777
- Really? / - Yes.

976
00:37:32,777 --> 00:37:34,643
I ate so much.

977
00:37:34,643 --> 00:37:35,610
- Over there. / - But you didn't gain much weight?

978
00:37:35,610 --> 00:37:38,343
I really stuffed myself over there.

979
00:37:38,343 --> 00:37:40,343
But then...

980
00:37:40,343 --> 00:37:41,677
- I didn't gain that much weight. / - Right?

981
00:37:41,677 --> 00:37:42,910
How about this corn?

982
00:37:42,910 --> 00:37:45,143
- Okay. / - This corn looks good.

983
00:37:45,143 --> 00:37:46,577
It's called bap xao tom.

984
00:37:46,577 --> 00:37:48,943
Bap means corn and tom means shrimp.

985
00:37:48,943 --> 00:37:50,810
- I think it'd be good. / - Really?

986
00:38:01,510 --> 00:38:03,810
- Is this that shaken thing? / - Yes.

987
00:38:04,510 --> 00:38:06,043
That looks so good.

988
00:38:06,043 --> 00:38:08,177
The bread looks delicious.

989
00:38:08,177 --> 00:38:09,777
Looks good!

990
00:38:09,777 --> 00:38:11,410
For 20 cents,

991
00:38:11,410 --> 00:38:12,577
you can keep ordering more bread.

992
00:38:12,577 --> 00:38:14,143
The bread is 20 cents.

993
00:38:24,477 --> 00:38:26,810
The food here...

994
00:38:27,977 --> 00:38:30,443
It suits the Korean palate.

995
00:38:30,443 --> 00:38:33,443
They use refreshing Vietnamese spices

996
00:38:33,443 --> 00:38:36,943
but it tastes similar to our braised ribs.

997
00:38:36,943 --> 00:38:39,343
It's a flavor that everyone can enjoy.

998
00:38:40,543 --> 00:38:41,610
Yeah, it's good.

999
00:38:43,377 --> 00:38:45,410
I normally like coriander.

1000
00:38:46,210 --> 00:38:48,643
- It's good with coriander. / - Because you sweat...

1001
00:38:48,643 --> 00:38:49,943
- Of course. / - In hot countries...

1002
00:38:49,943 --> 00:38:52,210
- The food is salty and stimulating. / - Right.

1003
00:38:52,210 --> 00:38:54,977
- The coriander tasted so good. / - That looks good.

1004
00:38:54,977 --> 00:38:58,410
This isn't eaten often

1005
00:38:58,410 --> 00:39:00,043
here in Vietnam.

1006
00:39:00,043 --> 00:39:03,010
They eat it at parties and on special days.

1007
00:39:03,677 --> 00:39:05,777
Really?

1008
00:39:05,777 --> 00:39:07,010
Let me try this

1009
00:39:07,010 --> 00:39:08,543
in a wrap.

1010
00:39:09,243 --> 00:39:15,543
(How does bo lac taste with vegetables?)

1011
00:39:16,643 --> 00:39:17,910
This tastes better with bread.

1012
00:39:17,910 --> 00:39:19,910
This tastes better with bread.

1013
00:39:20,743 --> 00:39:23,010
Does it not go with the lettuce? Like this?

1014
00:39:23,010 --> 00:39:25,643
- With the bread. / - They're like mother and daughter.

1015
00:39:25,643 --> 00:39:26,443
- Right. / - Yeah.

1016
00:39:26,443 --> 00:39:28,743
You get really hungry after a bath.

1017
00:39:28,743 --> 00:39:30,043
You do.

1018
00:39:30,910 --> 00:39:33,710
(I pair well with leafy vegetables)

1019
00:39:35,510 --> 00:39:36,910
This is so...

1020
00:39:36,910 --> 00:39:38,843
- In the wrap... / - That has to be good.

1021
00:39:38,843 --> 00:39:39,377
That looks so good.

1022
00:39:39,377 --> 00:39:41,343
It looks like stir-fried pork.

1023
00:39:41,343 --> 00:39:42,377
The bo lac...

1024
00:39:44,277 --> 00:39:45,910
That looks similar to lettuce.

1025
00:39:47,443 --> 00:39:48,143
Let's see.

1026
00:39:51,043 --> 00:39:52,377
if you eat it like that,

1027
00:39:52,377 --> 00:39:54,243
you don't get tired of it.

1028
00:39:55,177 --> 00:39:55,777
It's really good.

1029
00:39:55,777 --> 00:39:57,643
This tastes different to this one.

1030
00:39:57,643 --> 00:39:59,743
This seems more Korean.

1031
00:40:00,510 --> 00:40:01,877
It's not refreshing.

1032
00:40:01,877 --> 00:40:03,843
It's a little spicy.

1033
00:40:05,343 --> 00:40:07,143
You can't stop eating it.

1034
00:40:07,143 --> 00:40:09,043
Like Korean stir-fried pork.

1035
00:40:10,277 --> 00:40:12,210
- If you had to compare. / - Made of beef.

1036
00:40:12,210 --> 00:40:14,077
If you had to compare.

1037
00:40:14,077 --> 00:40:15,043
For me...

1038
00:40:15,043 --> 00:40:17,243
I like it better with this lettuce.

1039
00:40:20,543 --> 00:40:23,177
I thought only Koreans ate meat

1040
00:40:23,177 --> 00:40:24,643
wrapped in vegetables.

1041
00:40:24,643 --> 00:40:26,877
- But they do this Vietnam too. / - Yeah.

1042
00:40:27,977 --> 00:40:29,243
From what I see...

1043
00:40:29,243 --> 00:40:33,177
Bo lac is more delicious than this dish.

1044
00:40:33,177 --> 00:40:34,310
More than this one.

1045
00:40:34,310 --> 00:40:35,577
Yes, bo lac is better.

1046
00:40:38,543 --> 00:40:40,343
This is the dish you chose.

1047
00:40:42,143 --> 00:40:44,343
They must've fried the corn.

1048
00:40:44,343 --> 00:40:45,477
Is this dried shrimp?

1049
00:40:45,477 --> 00:40:46,777
That one!

1050
00:40:46,777 --> 00:40:49,377
- I'd like them to sell it in Korea. / - Stir-fried corn.

1051
00:40:49,377 --> 00:40:51,110
The price is amazing. It's $1.50.

1052
00:40:51,277 --> 00:40:53,943
- It's too expensive. How would you eat it? / - $1.50.

1053
00:40:54,277 --> 00:40:55,910
(Bap xao tom, $1.50)

1054
00:41:00,443 --> 00:41:01,443
How is it?

1055
00:41:02,077 --> 00:41:04,343
(Thumbs up)

1056
00:41:04,777 --> 00:41:06,177
For me...

1057
00:41:06,177 --> 00:41:07,843
(A whole new world)

1058
00:41:07,843 --> 00:41:09,610
You made an excellent choice.

1059
00:41:09,610 --> 00:41:10,777
This is so good.

1060
00:41:11,843 --> 00:41:14,743
This is something I haven't tasted before.

1061
00:41:14,743 --> 00:41:17,643
- It's savory and salty. / - It's so cheap.

1062
00:41:17,643 --> 00:41:18,910
- Perfect with beer. / - Yes, perfect with beer.

1063
00:41:18,910 --> 00:41:20,677
- With beer. / - It's perfect with beer.

1064
00:41:20,677 --> 00:41:22,610
- It's very crunchy. / - Oh, you ordered the beer.

1065
00:41:22,610 --> 00:41:23,910
- Hyunjoo, thank you. / - You worked hard.

1066
00:41:23,910 --> 00:41:25,877
Not at all. Traveling with you...

1067
00:41:25,877 --> 00:41:29,177
I'm able to experience things I wouldn't on my own.

1068
00:41:29,177 --> 00:41:31,477
I got to eat good food thanks to you.

1069
00:41:31,477 --> 00:41:32,143
Things I like.

1070
00:41:32,143 --> 00:41:33,377
Look forward to tomorrow as well.

1071
00:41:33,377 --> 00:41:35,177
Okay. Thank you.

1072
00:41:39,010 --> 00:41:40,077
The hot spring we'll be visiting today...

1073
00:41:40,077 --> 00:41:42,777
It's mud hot spring with an egg theme.

1074
00:41:42,777 --> 00:41:43,977
This is nice.

1075
00:41:43,977 --> 00:41:45,110
What is that?

1076
00:41:45,110 --> 00:41:47,377
- Mud hot spring. / - Okay.

1077
00:41:49,910 --> 00:41:51,343
If you look here...

1078
00:41:52,543 --> 00:41:53,610
This is so nice.

1079
00:41:53,610 --> 00:41:55,810
It's great that she's having fun.

1080
00:41:56,443 --> 00:41:58,243
- She eats well. / - Hyunjoo must've been real happy.

1081
00:41:58,243 --> 00:41:59,677
It's good.

1082
00:41:59,677 --> 00:42:01,710
This is my favorite.

1083
00:42:01,710 --> 00:42:02,643
This is nice.

1084
00:42:02,643 --> 00:42:04,410
It's good we came to Nha Trang.

1085
00:42:06,010 --> 00:42:07,577
This is nice.

1086
00:42:07,577 --> 00:42:08,777
- Yang Bay... / - Is ours over already?

1087
00:42:08,777 --> 00:42:09,910
For now.

1088
00:42:09,910 --> 00:42:12,143
- It ended too soon. / - That theme park...

1089
00:42:12,143 --> 00:42:13,943
You paid for a tour package, right?

1090
00:42:13,943 --> 00:42:15,477
You can apply for it.

1091
00:42:15,477 --> 00:42:18,077
You can pay a $7.50 entry fee

1092
00:42:18,077 --> 00:42:20,110
and enter the park.

1093
00:42:20,110 --> 00:42:22,243
If you use a tour package,

1094
00:42:22,243 --> 00:42:24,810
they pick you up, provide the meal,

1095
00:42:24,810 --> 00:42:28,543
and even give you an English guide.

1096
00:42:28,543 --> 00:42:30,010
- $7.50 for just the entry? / - Yes.

1097
00:42:30,010 --> 00:42:32,743
I shouldn't say this but the Fukuoka Tour team

1098
00:42:32,743 --> 00:42:33,743
just said,

1099
00:42:33,743 --> 00:42:35,210
"Let's go to Nha Trang next time."

1100
00:42:36,743 --> 00:42:39,077
Jungah, are you on our side now?

1101
00:42:39,077 --> 00:42:40,577
No, that's not it.

1102
00:42:40,577 --> 00:42:41,877
It's so affordable.

1103
00:42:41,877 --> 00:42:44,477
- I love eating. / - Really?

1104
00:42:44,477 --> 00:42:45,343
- It's awesome there. / - To be honest...

1105
00:42:45,343 --> 00:42:48,810
It's definitely cheaper than Japan and seems delicious.

1106
00:42:48,810 --> 00:42:50,210
- I was a tiny bit jealous. / - I hesitated at first.

1107
00:42:50,210 --> 00:42:51,943
But it was so good.

1108
00:42:53,310 --> 00:42:53,710
So good.

1109
00:42:53,710 --> 00:42:55,743
I want to applaud Guide Kong.

1110
00:42:55,743 --> 00:42:56,843
Well done, Guide Kong.

1111
00:42:56,843 --> 00:43:02,810
she enjoyed the trip way more than I thought.

1112
00:43:02,810 --> 00:43:03,743
She really liked it.

1113
00:43:03,743 --> 00:43:05,243
So from the first day,

1114
00:43:05,243 --> 00:43:07,210
I was able to let go of my concerns.

1115
00:43:07,210 --> 00:43:08,777
- She's so energetic. / - Very nice.

1116
00:43:08,777 --> 00:43:10,543
If she was tired and couldn't be bothered...

1117
00:43:10,543 --> 00:43:11,710
- It's really exhausting. / - Of course.

1118
00:43:11,710 --> 00:43:14,043
- But you really enjoyed it. / - The idea of traveling...

1119
00:43:14,043 --> 00:43:16,643
- Is to enjoy the local food. / - Right.

1120
00:43:16,643 --> 00:43:18,243
That's the point of traveling.

1121
00:43:18,243 --> 00:43:19,777
- It's to have fun. / - Right.

1122
00:43:19,777 --> 00:43:21,210
If you have time,

1123
00:43:21,210 --> 00:43:23,477
would you like to be an MC on our show?

1124
00:43:24,310 --> 00:43:25,977
- How about being a regular? / - We need one more.

1125
00:43:25,977 --> 00:43:27,577
How about becoming a regular member?

1126
00:43:27,577 --> 00:43:29,410
- You're so fun. / - That's a bit...

1127
00:43:29,410 --> 00:43:30,577
I'll think about it.

1128
00:43:30,577 --> 00:43:31,477
Yes, thank you.

1129
00:43:31,477 --> 00:43:32,477
Nha Trang, Vietnam.

1130
00:43:32,477 --> 00:43:35,743
Let's see what kind of fun they have now.

1131
00:43:35,743 --> 00:43:37,343
Guide Kong's Nha Trang Tour.

1132
00:43:37,343 --> 00:43:38,610
Let's check out the second half.

1133
00:43:40,777 --> 00:43:43,310
(Guide Kong's Nha Trang Tour, day 2)

1134
00:43:47,077 --> 00:43:48,377
The people are all so polite.

1135
00:43:48,377 --> 00:43:49,177
They're very polite.

1136
00:43:49,177 --> 00:43:50,843
- It's so good. / - They're all nice.

1137
00:43:58,443 --> 00:44:00,843
(What are the plans for day 2?)

1138
00:44:01,743 --> 00:44:07,110
(6 ways to enjoy Nha Trang, Po Nagar)

1139
00:44:07,977 --> 00:44:09,243
Guide Kong.

1140
00:44:09,243 --> 00:44:10,910
Where are we starting off today?

1141
00:44:11,377 --> 00:44:13,710
What you see here

1142
00:44:13,710 --> 00:44:18,110
is a place that existed for 1,300 years in Vietnam.

1143
00:44:18,110 --> 00:44:22,043
It's a Hindu temple raised by the Champa Kingdom.

1144
00:44:22,043 --> 00:44:24,577
Entry is $1.10.

1145
00:44:24,577 --> 00:44:25,777
Really?

1146
00:44:27,377 --> 00:44:29,110
- That's amazing. / - It's so good.

1147
00:44:30,177 --> 00:44:32,177
- Champa Kingdom? / - Yes.

1148
00:44:32,177 --> 00:44:34,243
There are many minority groups in Vietnam.

1149
00:44:34,243 --> 00:44:36,710
And the oldest group, the Champa Kingdom,

1150
00:44:36,710 --> 00:44:37,977
built this historic site.

1151
00:44:38,543 --> 00:44:42,043
It's called Po Nagar Cham tower.

1152
00:44:42,043 --> 00:44:45,077
As you can see, it's built on high grounds

1153
00:44:45,077 --> 00:44:47,543
so if you look down from there,

1154
00:44:47,543 --> 00:44:49,843
you can see all of Nha Trang city.

1155
00:44:49,843 --> 00:44:52,810
It was unique that the temple was in the city.

1156
00:44:52,810 --> 00:44:54,143
That was really charming.

1157
00:44:54,143 --> 00:44:57,143
- The fact that you don't have to go far... / - In the city.

1158
00:44:57,143 --> 00:44:59,477
To see a historic site. It's very convenient.

1159
00:44:59,477 --> 00:45:02,210
I guess it's a must to see this in Nha Trang.

1160
00:45:02,210 --> 00:45:05,043
- At least once... / - How did they build that back then?

1161
00:45:05,043 --> 00:45:07,643
There were 8 in total but only 4 are left.

1162
00:45:09,043 --> 00:45:11,843
(Entrance fee for Po Nagar, $1.10)

1163
00:45:12,977 --> 00:45:14,377
Also...

1164
00:45:14,377 --> 00:45:16,377
Are you okay to climb the steps?

1165
00:45:16,377 --> 00:45:17,943
I'm okay.

1166
00:45:17,943 --> 00:45:18,643
Why?

1167
00:45:18,643 --> 00:45:19,710
Are you short of breath?

1168
00:45:19,710 --> 00:45:20,710
No, I'm...

1169
00:45:20,710 --> 00:45:21,443
This is...

1170
00:45:21,443 --> 00:45:24,777
I feel like you're more fit than me.

1171
00:45:24,777 --> 00:45:26,210
I'm so embarrassed.

1172
00:45:26,210 --> 00:45:27,610
No, no.

1173
00:45:27,610 --> 00:45:28,510
My goodness.

1174
00:45:28,510 --> 00:45:31,543
How did they stack the stones like that?

1175
00:45:31,543 --> 00:45:35,343
How they delicately stacked the stones

1176
00:45:35,343 --> 00:45:40,077
is still a mystery like the Pyramids.

1177
00:45:40,077 --> 00:45:42,210
Yeah, yeah.

1178
00:45:42,210 --> 00:45:44,443
Those stones...

1179
00:45:44,443 --> 00:45:46,110
How did they stack them so neatly

1180
00:45:46,110 --> 00:45:47,677
like steamed rice cakes?

1181
00:45:47,677 --> 00:45:48,810
Like steamed rice cakes?

1182
00:45:48,810 --> 00:45:49,810
Rice cakes...

1183
00:45:49,810 --> 00:45:52,543
- It does seem like rice cakes. / - It does.

1184
00:45:52,543 --> 00:45:54,443
This is the Po Nagar temple

1185
00:45:54,443 --> 00:45:57,510
so there's a place that houses the goddess.

1186
00:45:57,510 --> 00:46:02,443
Po Nagar defines the goddess with 10 arms.

1187
00:46:02,443 --> 00:46:05,243
They come and pray here to have sons.

1188
00:46:05,243 --> 00:46:06,577
They have this...

1189
00:46:07,110 --> 00:46:08,410
In every country.

1190
00:46:09,043 --> 00:46:10,710
- Should we go further in? / - Okay.

1191
00:46:14,610 --> 00:46:16,410
You can go there in shorts, right?

1192
00:46:16,410 --> 00:46:16,777
You can't.

1193
00:46:16,777 --> 00:46:19,943
- They give you a gown to rent. / - Lengthy clothes.

1194
00:46:19,943 --> 00:46:24,077
(They're praying right now)

1195
00:46:24,977 --> 00:46:26,743
Did you pray?

1196
00:46:26,743 --> 00:46:27,777
I did.

1197
00:46:27,777 --> 00:46:31,543
I asked for lots of work next year.

1198
00:46:31,543 --> 00:46:34,310
I'm healthy now but...

1199
00:46:34,310 --> 00:46:36,310
- For good health? / - Yes, for good health.

1200
00:46:36,310 --> 00:46:38,277
I prayed for family health and happiness.

1201
00:46:38,277 --> 00:46:39,577
And that I'd get lots of work.

1202
00:46:39,577 --> 00:46:42,377
- Health... / - Health is most important.

1203
00:46:42,377 --> 00:46:44,410
Our episode of Battle Trip...

1204
00:46:44,977 --> 00:46:46,377
High viewer ratings.

1205
00:46:47,377 --> 00:46:49,643
She even thought of our ratings.

1206
00:46:49,643 --> 00:46:51,010
Thank you, ma'am.

1207
00:46:51,010 --> 00:46:52,410
Please be a regular.

1208
00:46:53,843 --> 00:46:55,043
I think the ratings will be too high.

1209
00:46:55,043 --> 00:46:57,243
Great ratings thanks to you.

1210
00:46:57,243 --> 00:46:58,977
Don't you think we'll win?

1211
00:46:58,977 --> 00:46:59,877
Done.

1212
00:47:03,010 --> 00:47:03,877
Nem nuong.

1213
00:47:04,743 --> 00:47:05,577
That was delicious.

1214
00:47:05,577 --> 00:47:06,643
Nem nuong?

1215
00:47:06,643 --> 00:47:11,077
(Po Nagar to nem nuong, 6 minutes)

1216
00:47:12,043 --> 00:47:13,243
- Hyunjoo. / - Yes.

1217
00:47:13,243 --> 00:47:15,510
Where are we headed right now?

1218
00:47:15,510 --> 00:47:16,943
Oh, here...

1219
00:47:16,943 --> 00:47:18,377
It's nem nuong.

1220
00:47:18,377 --> 00:47:21,277
It's a place with grilled meat restaurants.

1221
00:47:21,277 --> 00:47:22,210
- Really? / - Yes.

1222
00:47:22,910 --> 00:47:25,810
(A street filled with nem nuong places)

1223
00:47:26,043 --> 00:47:27,177
Nem.

1224
00:47:28,010 --> 00:47:29,010
- Nem nuong. / - Nem nuong.

1225
00:47:29,610 --> 00:47:31,377
They're all nem nuong.

1226
00:47:31,377 --> 00:47:34,177
- It's like pork hocks street in Korea. / - That's right.

1227
00:47:34,177 --> 00:47:35,277
- Famous places. / - Which one's the original?

1228
00:47:35,277 --> 00:47:36,110
That one is really famous.

1229
00:47:36,110 --> 00:47:37,710
The place with the stacked chairs.

1230
00:47:37,710 --> 00:47:39,543
Apparently, there's nowhere to sit in the evening.

1231
00:47:40,610 --> 00:47:44,143
(The nem nuong restaurant chosen by Guide Kong)

1232
00:47:44,143 --> 00:47:45,143
Nem nuong?

1233
00:47:45,143 --> 00:47:47,077
- Yes. / - Nem nuong?

1234
00:47:47,077 --> 00:47:48,010
If you look here...

1235
00:47:48,010 --> 00:47:49,810
- Oh, I see it. / - It's unique, right?

1236
00:47:49,810 --> 00:47:51,610
It's minced pork.

1237
00:47:51,610 --> 00:47:53,710
Cooked on charcoal.

1238
00:47:53,710 --> 00:47:55,877
They look like hotdogs.

1239
00:47:55,877 --> 00:47:57,110
They look like sausages, right?

1240
00:47:57,110 --> 00:47:58,443
Yes, sausages.

1241
00:47:58,443 --> 00:48:01,610
Is nem nuong

1242
00:48:01,610 --> 00:48:03,343
commonly eaten in Vietnam?

1243
00:48:03,343 --> 00:48:06,477
It's like our charcoal meat.

1244
00:48:06,477 --> 00:48:08,810
It's a dish enjoyed by Vietnamese.

1245
00:48:08,810 --> 00:48:10,610
- A native dish? / - Native dish.

1246
00:48:11,943 --> 00:48:13,477
Sikyung, you must want some.

1247
00:48:13,477 --> 00:48:14,043
I want to eat that.

1248
00:48:14,043 --> 00:48:16,010
When you shake your legs, it means you want it.

1249
00:48:17,077 --> 00:48:19,110
- Hyunjoo, nem nuong? / - Yes.

1250
00:48:19,110 --> 00:48:21,710
We saw the meat being cooked earlier.

1251
00:48:21,710 --> 00:48:23,910
Do we eat the cooked meat as is,

1252
00:48:23,910 --> 00:48:25,577
dipped in sauce?

1253
00:48:25,577 --> 00:48:27,743
Just as we have Vietnamese wraps in Korea...

1254
00:48:27,743 --> 00:48:31,010
You get dry rice paper

1255
00:48:31,010 --> 00:48:35,243
and just wrap it and eat it.

1256
00:48:35,243 --> 00:48:37,477
- It's a bit... / - But then it'd be too dry.

1257
00:48:37,477 --> 00:48:38,877
How do you eat that?

1258
00:48:38,877 --> 00:48:40,510
It's different to in Korea.

1259
00:48:40,510 --> 00:48:42,810
It's prepared in a more local way.

1260
00:48:42,810 --> 00:48:45,177
That's a famous place even there, right?

1261
00:48:45,177 --> 00:48:46,710
It's a really famous place.

1262
00:48:47,243 --> 00:48:50,243
It's packed even when it's not lunch time.

1263
00:48:51,543 --> 00:48:52,543
Nice.

1264
00:48:53,143 --> 00:48:55,810
(A table full of Vietnamese cuisine)

1265
00:48:55,810 --> 00:48:57,310
(Fried rice paper)

1266
00:48:57,310 --> 00:49:00,443
(Nem nuong)

1267
00:49:01,143 --> 00:49:03,910
(Nem nuong meal, $2,30 per person)

1268
00:49:03,910 --> 00:49:06,310
What is this?

1269
00:49:06,310 --> 00:49:07,143
What's this?

1270
00:49:07,143 --> 00:49:07,910
Mango.

1271
00:49:07,910 --> 00:49:09,710
- Mango? / - Yes.

1272
00:49:12,477 --> 00:49:14,710
- An unripe mango. / - No mango!

1273
00:49:14,710 --> 00:49:15,477
So sour.

1274
00:49:17,377 --> 00:49:18,543
What kind of mango is this?

1275
00:49:18,543 --> 00:49:21,243
They served unripe mango.

1276
00:49:21,243 --> 00:49:22,977
How do we eat this?

1277
00:49:25,977 --> 00:49:27,243
He would've washed his hands, right?

1278
00:49:28,177 --> 00:49:29,477
Your hands clean?

1279
00:49:31,577 --> 00:49:32,943
Your hands clean?

1280
00:49:33,577 --> 00:49:34,843
Your hands clean?

1281
00:49:37,677 --> 00:49:39,877
Just like with Vietnamese wraps.

1282
00:49:39,877 --> 00:49:41,077
Like this...

1283
00:49:41,077 --> 00:49:42,710
Isn't everything so fresh?

1284
00:49:43,543 --> 00:49:44,877
This is nem nuong.

1285
00:49:44,877 --> 00:49:46,843
- Nem nuong. / - Nem nuong.

1286
00:49:48,277 --> 00:49:49,377
So you do this...

1287
00:49:49,377 --> 00:49:51,243
Wrap it up.

1288
00:49:51,243 --> 00:49:51,910
Dip it?

1289
00:49:51,910 --> 00:49:54,010
This a special sauce.

1290
00:49:55,843 --> 00:49:57,210
That looks so good.

1291
00:49:57,210 --> 00:49:58,877
- It's so good. / - So good.

1292
00:49:58,877 --> 00:49:59,943
That looks so good.

1293
00:49:59,943 --> 00:50:01,377
- That looks really good. / - So good.

1294
00:50:04,110 --> 00:50:04,910
Let's see.

1295
00:50:06,110 --> 00:50:08,943
(Crunch)

1296
00:50:09,810 --> 00:50:11,243
How is it? How does it taste?

1297
00:50:12,743 --> 00:50:14,910
(Mmm)

1298
00:50:15,610 --> 00:50:20,077
It's not as refreshing as spring rolls in Korea.

1299
00:50:20,077 --> 00:50:21,410
Rather...

1300
00:50:21,410 --> 00:50:23,043
It'd taste better...

1301
00:50:23,943 --> 00:50:26,077
With these chilies and garlic.

1302
00:50:26,077 --> 00:50:27,410
I'll try it.

1303
00:50:27,410 --> 00:50:29,010
I'll try it.

1304
00:50:29,010 --> 00:50:30,910
- That's really spicy! / - It's really spicy.

1305
00:50:30,910 --> 00:50:33,077
That pepper is too spicy.

1306
00:50:33,077 --> 00:50:34,643
Oh, no.

1307
00:50:34,643 --> 00:50:35,077
No!

1308
00:50:35,077 --> 00:50:36,610
- Whole... / - It tastes good with it.

1309
00:50:36,610 --> 00:50:37,877
- So daring. / - What?

1310
00:50:37,877 --> 00:50:38,877
That...

1311
00:50:38,877 --> 00:50:41,177
There's pleasure in that intense heat coming and leaving.

1312
00:50:41,177 --> 00:50:43,343
- That's... / - That'd be so spicy.

1313
00:50:43,343 --> 00:50:45,943
You eat that for punishments.

1314
00:50:48,310 --> 00:50:50,310
Isn't it spicy? It's too spicy.

1315
00:50:50,310 --> 00:50:51,077
Are you okay?

1316
00:50:53,477 --> 00:50:54,477
- Oh, my. / - Oh, my God.

1317
00:50:54,477 --> 00:50:55,177
Are you okay?

1318
00:50:55,910 --> 00:50:58,543
(Oh, no)

1319
00:51:01,710 --> 00:51:03,177
It's spicy but good.

1320
00:51:04,343 --> 00:51:05,577
This nem nuong

1321
00:51:05,577 --> 00:51:08,343
needs pepper and raw garlic.

1322
00:51:08,343 --> 00:51:09,510
For my personal tastes.

1323
00:51:09,810 --> 00:51:12,177
With that nem nuong,

1324
00:51:12,177 --> 00:51:14,043
you can't stop eating.

1325
00:51:14,043 --> 00:51:15,643
- Look so good. / - You keep wrapping them.

1326
00:51:15,643 --> 00:51:17,810
- You keep wrapping. With beer. / - Order more.

1327
00:51:17,810 --> 00:51:19,710
- It's not fattening and it's low calories. / - Also...

1328
00:51:19,710 --> 00:51:24,010
That meat has the flavor that kids like.

1329
00:51:24,010 --> 00:51:25,143
It's perfect for them.

1330
00:51:26,077 --> 00:51:27,443
- I'll try it. / - Try some.

1331
00:51:27,977 --> 00:51:29,477
- First. / - Lettuce and chives.

1332
00:51:33,043 --> 00:51:37,077
I think it'd taste good with this in it.

1333
00:51:37,943 --> 00:51:40,677
(Will Guide Kong like it too?)

1334
00:51:41,777 --> 00:51:43,777
(Crunch)

1335
00:51:43,777 --> 00:51:45,077
How is it? Is it good?

1336
00:51:45,077 --> 00:51:46,677
It's so crunchy and nice.

1337
00:51:46,677 --> 00:51:48,043
The texture...

1338
00:51:48,043 --> 00:51:51,910
Vietnamese wraps have that chewy texture.

1339
00:51:51,910 --> 00:51:54,110
But since you don't wet the paper,

1340
00:51:54,110 --> 00:51:57,277
it's crunchy and the flavor of the meat

1341
00:51:57,277 --> 00:51:59,077
mixes well with the vegetables.

1342
00:51:59,077 --> 00:52:01,143
It's really savory.

1343
00:52:01,143 --> 00:52:03,710
I don't prefer strong flavors.

1344
00:52:03,710 --> 00:52:07,410
I preferred it without the chili.

1345
00:52:07,410 --> 00:52:11,377
I wrapped it with the sauce inside.

1346
00:52:11,377 --> 00:52:12,010
Really?

1347
00:52:12,010 --> 00:52:14,043
- I found it easier to eat that way. / - Was it?

1348
00:52:16,943 --> 00:52:22,143
(They try the meat on its own)

1349
00:52:24,343 --> 00:52:27,810
This is perfect for kids.

1350
00:52:27,810 --> 00:52:29,643
- Tastes like sausages. / - Sausages?

1351
00:52:29,643 --> 00:52:32,177
It has a sweet seasoning.

1352
00:52:33,510 --> 00:52:36,377
(Crunchy fried rice paper)

1353
00:52:36,377 --> 00:52:38,477
I think this provides the savory flavor.

1354
00:52:38,810 --> 00:52:41,343
(I am the reason for savory flavor)

1355
00:52:41,710 --> 00:52:44,077
I like vegetables so I'll add a lot.

1356
00:52:44,710 --> 00:52:47,277
(A lot of veggies)

1357
00:52:47,677 --> 00:52:48,843
Add lots.

1358
00:52:51,010 --> 00:52:52,610
Nice.

1359
00:52:53,043 --> 00:52:53,977
Goodness.

1360
00:52:54,610 --> 00:52:56,443
Aren't you being too greedy?

1361
00:52:56,443 --> 00:52:58,143
(Let's try this)

1362
00:53:03,777 --> 00:53:05,910
(Thumbs up)

1363
00:53:07,177 --> 00:53:09,343
The way you eat it...

1364
00:53:09,343 --> 00:53:12,443
It makes you want to pick up the phone and order.

1365
00:53:12,443 --> 00:53:16,410
It feels like it'll be sold out on home shopping.

1366
00:53:18,010 --> 00:53:22,643
She eats better than the people on "Delicious Guys."

1367
00:53:22,643 --> 00:53:23,843
Sold out.

1368
00:53:24,477 --> 00:53:26,310
Now...

1369
00:53:26,310 --> 00:53:28,443
The theme of this trip is

1370
00:53:28,443 --> 00:53:31,643
conquering the hot springs, right?

1371
00:53:32,077 --> 00:53:35,743
There's a special hot spring I've prepared for today.

1372
00:53:36,043 --> 00:53:38,010
The hot spring you'll visit today...

1373
00:53:38,010 --> 00:53:39,543
It's a mud hot spring.

1374
00:53:40,310 --> 00:53:42,577
Can we eat some more first?

1375
00:53:44,177 --> 00:53:47,410
- Next up is the mud hot spring. / - Okay.

1376
00:53:47,410 --> 00:53:49,110
- Do you like it? / - Yes.

1377
00:53:49,110 --> 00:53:50,310
I love it.

1378
00:53:51,010 --> 00:53:53,043
She's healthy because she eats well.

1379
00:53:53,043 --> 00:53:54,343
I think that's why I'm healthy.

1380
00:53:54,343 --> 00:53:56,377
- Because I eat well. / - Nem nuong is a must.

1381
00:53:58,443 --> 00:54:02,743
(Nem nuong to egg mud hot spring, 30 minutes)

1382
00:54:03,410 --> 00:54:05,210
It's called Tram Trung?

1383
00:54:05,543 --> 00:54:07,310
- Egg? / - Oh, here.

1384
00:54:07,310 --> 00:54:10,010
It's a mud hot spring with an egg theme.

1385
00:54:10,010 --> 00:54:12,343
You see the eggs there?

1386
00:54:12,343 --> 00:54:14,877
- That was so funny. / - Why?

1387
00:54:15,143 --> 00:54:18,243
They've decorated with eggs and chickens.

1388
00:54:18,243 --> 00:54:21,577
It was so cute.

1389
00:54:22,510 --> 00:54:25,810
- It'd be good to go there with kids. / - It's the concept.

1390
00:54:25,810 --> 00:54:27,143
It's chickens everywhere.

1391
00:54:27,143 --> 00:54:30,410
With lots of chickens and eggs...

1392
00:54:30,410 --> 00:54:32,343
1, 2, 3.

1393
00:54:33,543 --> 00:54:34,977
1, 2, 3.

1394
00:54:39,043 --> 00:54:41,643
Since I love eggs,

1395
00:54:41,643 --> 00:54:42,943
I feel like eating...

1396
00:54:42,943 --> 00:54:44,110
Boiled eggs.

1397
00:54:44,110 --> 00:54:49,043
That hot spring is fairly new

1398
00:54:49,043 --> 00:54:51,277
so it's really clean.

1399
00:54:51,277 --> 00:54:53,977
This is the hot spring swimming pool.

1400
00:54:53,977 --> 00:54:56,977
If you just pay the entry fee, you can swim

1401
00:54:56,977 --> 00:54:58,943
and enjoy the hot spring.

1402
00:55:00,177 --> 00:55:01,710
It's really big.

1403
00:55:01,710 --> 00:55:04,710
You could spend an entire day there.

1404
00:55:06,110 --> 00:55:08,343
- So we go up this way? / - Yes.

1405
00:55:08,343 --> 00:55:10,277
There are so many eggs here.

1406
00:55:10,277 --> 00:55:12,177
We did spend some money...

1407
00:55:12,177 --> 00:55:14,777
- And we got individual springs. / - Oh, really?

1408
00:55:14,777 --> 00:55:18,577
It's one egg per person.

1409
00:55:18,577 --> 00:55:20,277
- Private? / - Yeah.

1410
00:55:23,177 --> 00:55:25,477
- So we go in here? / - Yes.

1411
00:55:25,477 --> 00:55:27,677
It's mud.

1412
00:55:31,810 --> 00:55:34,077
They have numbers like hotel rooms.

1413
00:55:34,743 --> 00:55:35,777
Oh, my goodness.

1414
00:55:36,677 --> 00:55:39,343
(So beautiful)

1415
00:55:39,343 --> 00:55:41,643
(She enters the egg mud with a great body)

1416
00:55:43,410 --> 00:55:44,410
It's deep.

1417
00:55:45,210 --> 00:55:46,277
Is it deeper than it looks?

1418
00:55:46,277 --> 00:55:48,677
- So deep. / - What's deep?

1419
00:55:48,677 --> 00:55:51,810
- Hyunjoo's just... / - It's not deep.

1420
00:55:52,477 --> 00:55:53,910
Okay.

1421
00:55:53,910 --> 00:55:56,277
She's already inside.

1422
00:55:56,277 --> 00:55:58,210
It feels like my skin is getting sleek.

1423
00:55:58,210 --> 00:56:00,110
I can stay in here for 40 minutes.

1424
00:56:00,110 --> 00:56:01,577
I don't want to leave.

1425
00:56:01,577 --> 00:56:02,977
Was it warm? How was it?

1426
00:56:02,977 --> 00:56:05,310
It's warm.

1427
00:56:05,310 --> 00:56:07,010
That'd be so nice then.

1428
00:56:07,010 --> 00:56:08,877
- Ma'am. / - Yes.

1429
00:56:10,510 --> 00:56:11,877
Through here?

1430
00:56:13,710 --> 00:56:15,443
She's so cute.

1431
00:56:16,543 --> 00:56:18,477
Hey, this is nice.

1432
00:56:18,477 --> 00:56:21,343
- So cute. / - The theme is fun.

1433
00:56:21,343 --> 00:56:23,243
In this forest...

1434
00:56:23,243 --> 00:56:25,777
- It's like we're in the jungle. / - Exactly.

1435
00:56:25,777 --> 00:56:27,143
So nice.

1436
00:56:27,143 --> 00:56:29,477
The private tubs are good.

1437
00:56:29,477 --> 00:56:32,577
Nice, nice. With all those trees...

1438
00:56:32,577 --> 00:56:33,310
It's so nice like this.

1439
00:56:33,310 --> 00:56:35,577
It'd be nice here with kids.

1440
00:56:35,577 --> 00:56:37,977
Mothers and daughters...

1441
00:56:37,977 --> 00:56:38,477
It'd be nice to come together.

1442
00:56:38,477 --> 00:56:39,810
I think that'd be nice.

01:04:35,977 --> 01:04:37,643
we've come a slightly

1620
01:04:37,643 --> 01:04:39,510
fancy Vietnamese restaurant.

1621
01:04:39,510 --> 01:04:41,877
Why didn't you take me here earlier?

1622
01:04:41,877 --> 01:04:43,843
If we had started with places like this...

1623
01:04:43,843 --> 01:04:47,410
- You'd be dissatisfied with the others. / - True.

1624
01:04:47,410 --> 01:04:49,277
This is a really famous place

1625
01:04:49,277 --> 01:04:53,110
many locals and tourists come here.

1626
01:04:54,877 --> 01:04:57,743
(A table full of food)

1627
01:04:58,943 --> 01:05:04,543
(Food looks as good as the restaurant)

1628
01:05:05,743 --> 01:05:08,077
(How will the food taste?)

1629
01:05:08,077 --> 01:05:09,243
- Shall we try it? / - Okay.

1630
01:05:09,243 --> 01:05:11,143
Let's dig in.

1631
01:05:11,143 --> 01:05:14,377
- This is the spring roll? / - Yes.

1632
01:05:14,377 --> 01:05:16,610
- These are like the spring rolls in Korea? / - Yes.

1633
01:05:16,610 --> 01:05:17,943
This is called goi cuon.

1634
01:05:17,943 --> 01:05:20,410
It's a traditional Vietnamese dish.

1635
01:05:20,943 --> 01:05:24,577
We normally have it with peanut sauce.

1636
01:05:24,577 --> 01:05:29,243
But it's a different peanut sauce here.

1637
01:05:29,243 --> 01:05:31,310
I want to try this first.

1638
01:05:33,010 --> 01:05:35,577
That's really good.

1639
01:05:35,577 --> 01:05:37,343
This isn't right.

1640
01:05:37,377 --> 01:05:40,210
This is just...

1641
01:05:45,710 --> 01:05:47,577
It's a spring roll.

1642
01:05:47,577 --> 01:05:49,677
It's a bit different to Korea.

1643
01:05:49,677 --> 01:05:51,743
It's a wrap.

1644
01:05:51,743 --> 01:05:54,110
- That isn't fattening at all. / - It's a spring roll.

1645
01:05:54,110 --> 01:05:56,243
But it's different to spring rolls in Korea.

1646
01:05:56,243 --> 01:05:58,877
The previous place we went to...

1647
01:05:58,877 --> 01:06:02,077
They just put meat and vegetables.

1648
01:06:02,077 --> 01:06:05,677
But here they add seafood

1649
01:06:05,677 --> 01:06:07,710
and wrap it in rice paper.

1650
01:06:07,710 --> 01:06:12,677
Even I think we're eating way too much here.

1651
01:06:12,677 --> 01:06:14,443
When we travel overseas,

1652
01:06:14,443 --> 01:06:16,843
the most important thing is a good restaurant.

1653
01:06:16,843 --> 01:06:19,177
You just introduce the places

1654
01:06:19,177 --> 01:06:20,477
and I'm doing all the eating here.

1655
01:06:20,477 --> 01:06:23,277
You won't get fat but I'll gain tons of weight.

1656
01:06:23,277 --> 01:06:25,243
Is she a rapper?

1657
01:06:25,243 --> 01:06:27,310
Show me the money.

1658
01:06:29,410 --> 01:06:31,610
I'm eating a lot too.

1659
01:06:31,610 --> 01:06:33,943
You don't like coriander as much as me...

1660
01:06:36,310 --> 01:06:38,910
It tastes good no matter how much weight I'd gain.

1661
01:06:40,377 --> 01:06:43,243
(She eats the last bite)

1662
01:06:44,877 --> 01:06:46,543
- Shrimp. / - Fried shrimp.

1663
01:06:47,810 --> 01:06:51,177
- Shrimp cha gio. / - It's good.

1664
01:06:51,177 --> 01:06:53,910
My favorite Vietnamese dish is cha gio.

1665
01:06:53,910 --> 01:06:55,410
- Shall we have a taste? / - Yes.

1666
01:07:03,510 --> 01:07:05,177
(Thumbs up)

1667
01:07:05,177 --> 01:07:06,610
It's good.

1668
01:07:06,810 --> 01:07:09,943
It has shrimps and minced meat.

1669
01:07:10,477 --> 01:07:12,243
It's good.

1670
01:07:12,243 --> 01:07:14,177
(Simultaneously)

1671
01:07:14,910 --> 01:07:16,443
I'll be thinking of this in Korea.

1672
01:07:16,443 --> 01:07:18,277
I'll crave it.

1673
01:07:23,477 --> 01:07:26,443
Vietnam is famous for pho, right?

1674
01:07:26,443 --> 01:07:28,343
For today,

1675
01:07:28,343 --> 01:07:29,677
I ordered a famous

1676
01:07:29,677 --> 01:07:31,943
mixed noodles in Vietnam.

1677
01:07:31,943 --> 01:07:34,477
At Vietnamese restaurants in Korea,

1678
01:07:34,477 --> 01:07:36,277
they sell this as bun cha.

1679
01:07:36,277 --> 01:07:38,810
It's popular among Koreans too.

1680
01:07:38,810 --> 01:07:40,510
Try some.

1681
01:07:41,077 --> 01:07:43,243
They eat like there's no tomorrow.

1682
01:07:43,243 --> 01:07:45,843
It was just so good.

1683
01:07:46,943 --> 01:07:48,043
Like this...

1684
01:07:48,443 --> 01:07:50,010
Dip it in the sauce.

1685
01:07:56,743 --> 01:08:02,710
(How does local bun cha taste?)

1686
01:08:06,710 --> 01:08:09,077
- It's good, right? / - It's good.

1687
01:08:10,177 --> 01:08:14,143
The basic taste of Southeast Asian cuisine.

1688
01:08:14,510 --> 01:08:17,943
They have a special sauce of this region

1689
01:08:17,943 --> 01:08:20,177
that's different to coriander.

1690
01:08:20,177 --> 01:08:22,243
It's sweet yet salty.

1691
01:08:22,243 --> 01:08:24,610
It has a sweeter taste.

1692
01:08:24,610 --> 01:08:26,677
That tastes like pork ribs.

1693
01:08:26,677 --> 01:08:29,110
- The sauce... / - It's stimulating.

1694
01:08:29,110 --> 01:08:31,443
- Yes, with veggies... / - Jungah is on our side.

1695
01:08:31,443 --> 01:08:32,877
No.

1696
01:08:32,877 --> 01:08:35,210
I'm just concentrating.

1697
01:08:36,343 --> 01:08:38,277
I'd better try it.

1698
01:08:38,477 --> 01:08:40,977
Since it's so cheap here,

1699
01:08:40,977 --> 01:08:44,110
it's great that we can order everything we want.

1700
01:08:44,110 --> 01:08:45,810
How much was all this?

1701
01:08:45,810 --> 01:08:48,277
This is a fancy restaurant.

1702
01:08:48,277 --> 01:08:51,077
We ordered so many dishes but...

1703
01:08:51,077 --> 01:08:54,210
- How much? I wouldn't know. / - $11?

1704
01:08:54,210 --> 01:08:55,710
Hyunjoo paid.

1705
01:08:55,710 --> 01:08:58,943
If you come as a family...

1706
01:08:58,943 --> 01:09:01,610
I think this is a tourist spot

1707
01:09:01,610 --> 01:09:03,910
where you can eat everything...

1708
01:09:03,910 --> 01:09:07,843
- You and your kids want. / - Nha Trang?

1709
01:09:07,843 --> 01:09:11,377
- It's expensive in Japan. / - It is.

1710
01:09:11,510 --> 01:09:14,410
I think it's great for an eating trip here.

1711
01:09:14,410 --> 01:09:16,143
Yes, very cost-effective.

1712
01:09:19,010 --> 01:09:23,477
(It's already the final night)

1713
01:09:24,743 --> 01:09:30,677
(The beautiful night view of Nha Trang)

1714
01:09:33,877 --> 01:09:36,577
Even young kids can go in there.

1715
01:09:36,577 --> 01:09:37,910
- There? / - Yes.

1716
01:09:37,910 --> 01:09:41,143
The club only opens late at night.

1717
01:09:41,143 --> 01:09:43,210
If you avoid those times...

1718
01:09:43,210 --> 01:09:45,777
- You can go there with family. / - That's good.

1719
01:09:45,777 --> 01:09:48,810
We went up there and the cool breeze...

1720
01:09:48,810 --> 01:09:50,843
Since it gets cooler in the evening.

1721
01:09:50,843 --> 01:09:52,743
The cool air was nice.

1722
01:09:52,743 --> 01:09:57,243
You can see a 360 degree view of the night.

1723
01:09:57,243 --> 01:09:59,477
If you go there...

1724
01:09:59,477 --> 01:10:00,443
- Oh, yes. / - Yes.

1725
01:10:00,443 --> 01:10:03,743
I see a stage over there.

1726
01:10:03,743 --> 01:10:05,610
After 10 o'clock, it's a club.

1727
01:10:07,510 --> 01:10:10,810
I have to see Guide Kong's dance skills.

1728
01:10:11,210 --> 01:10:12,310
Okay.

1729
01:10:15,043 --> 01:10:17,210
She's so funny.

1730
01:10:17,210 --> 01:10:19,377
You can feel our groove, right?

1731
01:10:21,877 --> 01:10:25,110
- What's wrong with me? / - She was too good for me.

1732
01:10:25,110 --> 01:10:26,677
- She really knows how to have fun. / - What's wrong?

1733
01:10:26,677 --> 01:10:29,077
Are you insane, Jungsoo?

1734
01:10:30,377 --> 01:10:33,110
There she goes again.

1735
01:10:34,243 --> 01:10:36,777
(She wants to dance some more)

1736
01:10:38,277 --> 01:10:40,377
You need to groove.

1737
01:10:40,377 --> 01:10:41,377
Oh, yeah.

1738
01:10:41,377 --> 01:10:43,077
It seems like you've been to lots of clubs.

1739
01:10:43,077 --> 01:10:44,810
I only studied.

1740
01:10:46,610 --> 01:10:50,743
(A cocktail for the studious Jungsoo)

1741
01:10:55,477 --> 01:10:58,043
- It's $7.50 for entry. / - Free drinks?

1742
01:10:58,043 --> 01:11:00,077
- With a free drink. / - For real?

1743
01:11:02,110 --> 01:11:03,710
That's part of the entry fee?

1744
01:11:03,710 --> 01:11:06,143
That drink was nice too.

1745
01:11:07,243 --> 01:11:08,443
Thank you.

1746
01:11:08,443 --> 01:11:10,410
Our final night.

1747
01:11:10,410 --> 01:11:12,610
- Let's end on a high. / - Yes.

1748
01:11:16,910 --> 01:11:18,110
It's good.

1749
01:11:19,410 --> 01:11:20,910
It's so good.

1750
01:11:23,377 --> 01:11:24,843
- It's refreshing, right? / - Yeah.

1751
01:11:24,843 --> 01:11:26,743
- Let me try yours. / - Yeah.

1752
01:11:26,743 --> 01:11:28,910
(She takes out the mint)

1753
01:11:29,277 --> 01:11:30,010
(Pick)

1754
01:11:30,010 --> 01:11:32,577
(To her mouth)

1755
01:11:33,177 --> 01:11:34,077
This...

1756
01:11:34,077 --> 01:11:36,577
Why do I like herbs so much?

1757
01:11:37,110 --> 01:11:39,943
- When I see these... / - It's for decoration.

1758
01:11:39,943 --> 01:11:41,210
Try it.

1759
01:11:41,210 --> 01:11:43,543
- It's mint. / - Yeah, mint is delicious.

1760
01:11:46,143 --> 01:11:47,477
Isn't it good?

1761
01:11:49,543 --> 01:11:51,477
(While she's busy with the cocktail)

1762
01:11:51,477 --> 01:11:53,377
(Spits it out)

1763
01:11:54,077 --> 01:11:57,577
- Don't you like mint? / - No, it's too strong.

1764
01:11:59,810 --> 01:12:01,577
I like it.

1765
01:12:01,577 --> 01:12:04,043
Let me just live in Vietnam.

1766
01:12:04,043 --> 01:12:06,143
Being here on a rooftop...

1767
01:12:06,143 --> 01:12:09,110
Listening to music and having a drink... How is it?

1768
01:12:09,110 --> 01:12:10,210
I love it.

1769
01:12:10,210 --> 01:12:12,877
When you first suggested we come here,

1770
01:12:12,877 --> 01:12:15,977
I don't really like being up on high places.

1771
01:12:15,977 --> 01:12:18,210
But if you visit Nha Trang,

1772
01:12:18,210 --> 01:12:21,043
make sure you go to a rooftop.

1773
01:12:21,043 --> 01:12:23,743
It's so cool here.

1774
01:12:24,710 --> 01:12:26,877
With incredible music...

1775
01:12:26,877 --> 01:12:30,643
And a cocktail.

1776
01:12:30,643 --> 01:12:33,077
It's nice.

1777
01:12:33,077 --> 01:12:35,343
How was the tour?

1778
01:12:35,343 --> 01:12:37,710
First, I never knew

1779
01:12:37,710 --> 01:12:40,710
that I liked Vietnamese food this much.

1780
01:12:40,710 --> 01:12:42,777
I realized it for the first time.

1781
01:12:43,343 --> 01:12:46,977
When I don't have an appetite,

1782
01:12:46,977 --> 01:12:50,110
sometimes I had Vietnamese food.

1783
01:12:50,110 --> 01:12:55,110
But I really had no idea

1784
01:12:55,110 --> 01:12:57,577
that I'd enjoy local Vietnamese food this much.

1785
01:12:57,577 --> 01:13:00,110
With my loving junior...

1786
01:13:00,110 --> 01:13:03,510
It was great to share special moments.

1787
01:13:03,510 --> 01:13:05,010
I liked that the best.

1788
01:13:05,010 --> 01:13:10,043
It felt like I was traveling with a friend my age.

1789
01:13:10,043 --> 01:13:13,610
You had more fun than me.

1790
01:13:13,610 --> 01:13:14,610
When I saw that...

1791
01:13:14,610 --> 01:13:17,143
The things I hesitated with,

1792
01:13:17,143 --> 01:13:20,243
you enjoyed without fear.

1793
01:13:20,243 --> 01:13:21,177
It was embarrassing.

1794
01:13:21,177 --> 01:13:23,410
I was supposed to be the guide.

1795
01:13:24,610 --> 01:13:29,910
(The final part of the memorable Nha Trang Tour)

1796
01:13:30,410 --> 01:13:32,343
- Nha Trang Tour. / - Nha Trang Tour.

1797
01:13:32,343 --> 01:13:33,843
- Let's go! / - Let's go!

1798
01:13:37,310 --> 01:13:39,943
Isn't that Gangbyeonbuk-ro in Korea?

1799
01:13:45,177 --> 01:13:47,677
That was...

1800
01:13:47,677 --> 01:13:49,810
Such an energetic trip

1801
01:13:49,810 --> 01:13:51,910
despite being in Spain not long ago.

1802
01:13:51,910 --> 01:13:53,210
It was so nice to watch again.

1803
01:13:53,210 --> 01:13:53,943
I want to go again.

1804
01:13:53,943 --> 01:13:56,777
I think this tour was so perfect.

1805
01:13:56,777 --> 01:14:00,510
You should make a travel package named Kong Tour.

1806
01:14:00,510 --> 01:14:02,243
I really like that idea.

1807
01:14:02,243 --> 01:14:04,277
- Kong Hyunjoo... / - It was perfect.

1808
01:14:04,277 --> 01:14:05,810
I'm asking as a father.

1809
01:14:05,810 --> 01:14:07,677
How long from the airport to hotel?

1810
01:14:07,677 --> 01:14:09,077
From the airport to hotel...

1811
01:14:09,077 --> 01:14:10,677
Was it 50 minutes?

1812
01:14:10,677 --> 01:14:11,810
- How long? 50 minutes? / - It's far.

1813
01:14:11,810 --> 01:14:14,043
The hotel is too far from the airport.

1814
01:14:14,043 --> 01:14:14,877
He's doing that on purpose.

1815
01:14:14,877 --> 01:14:17,177
We'll attack one more time.

1816
01:14:17,177 --> 01:14:19,410
Let's check the travel expenses of Kong Tour,

1817
01:14:19,410 --> 01:14:20,543
excluding the airfare.

1818
01:14:20,543 --> 01:14:22,910
For 3 days and 2 nights, you ate so much.

1819
01:14:22,910 --> 01:14:24,010
- Enjoyed hot springs to the fullest. / - Yes.

1820
01:14:24,010 --> 01:14:26,677
- You stayed at a 5 star hotel? / - Of course.

1821
01:14:26,677 --> 01:14:29,577
- For 3 days on the Kong Tour... / - You'll be shocked.

1822
01:14:29,577 --> 01:14:31,877
- The expenses at Nha Trang... / - Total costs.

1823
01:14:31,877 --> 01:14:33,843
- Per person... / - Per person?

1824
01:14:33,843 --> 01:14:34,410
Please tell them.

1825
01:14:34,410 --> 01:14:37,277
$225.90.

1826
01:14:39,477 --> 01:14:40,210
This is so...

1827
01:14:40,210 --> 01:14:41,277
$225.90.

1828
01:14:41,277 --> 01:14:43,377
- The cost-effectiveness... / - $220.

1829
01:14:43,377 --> 01:14:46,077
Isn't that the cost of one meal in Fukuoka?

1830
01:14:46,077 --> 01:14:48,110
It's not that expensive.

1831
01:14:48,110 --> 01:14:49,343
That's going too far.

1832
01:14:49,343 --> 01:14:50,810
If you have proper sashimi...

1833
01:14:50,810 --> 01:14:52,177
- It'd cost more. / - With drinks...

1834
01:14:52,177 --> 01:14:54,610
We didn't eat sashimi.

1835
01:14:58,477 --> 01:15:01,110
- For me, Vietnam... / - We ate cheap food.

1836
01:15:01,110 --> 01:15:02,143
I knew it was cheap.

1837
01:15:02,143 --> 01:15:04,743
- But I didn't think it was this cheap. / - The hotel...

1838
01:15:04,743 --> 01:15:07,477
It cost $57 per person.

1839
01:15:07,477 --> 01:15:08,810
We accept that.

1840
01:15:08,810 --> 01:15:10,243
- Including breakfast. / - We accept it.

1841
01:15:10,243 --> 01:15:12,710
Nha Trang was good.

1842
01:15:12,710 --> 01:15:14,110
How long did the flight take?

1843
01:15:14,110 --> 01:15:15,610
The flight took some time.

1844
01:15:15,610 --> 01:15:19,110
- That's a bit... / - 5 hours and 20 minutes.

1845
01:15:19,110 --> 01:15:20,843
- It's a direct flight. / - Direct flight?

1846
01:15:20,843 --> 01:15:21,843
- There's a direct flight. / - There is!

1847
01:15:21,843 --> 01:15:24,543
- To Nha Trang? / - Yes.

1848
01:15:24,543 --> 01:15:27,710
They're going to make another direct flight.

1849
01:15:27,710 --> 01:15:29,277
We took a direct flight.

1850
01:15:29,277 --> 01:15:31,810
Great. Now we'll head to Fukuoka.

1851
01:15:31,810 --> 01:15:33,843
- Next week. / - Are you confident?

1852
01:15:33,843 --> 01:15:34,343
- Us? / - Yes.

1853
01:15:34,343 --> 01:15:35,743
Jungah is already on our side.

1854
01:15:35,743 --> 01:15:37,943
No, I'm...

1855
01:15:37,943 --> 01:15:41,010
She's completely into our trip.

1856
01:15:41,010 --> 01:15:43,343
The food looked so delicious

1857
01:15:43,343 --> 01:15:45,477
and it cost so little.

1858
01:15:45,477 --> 01:15:47,877
That was pretty good.

1859
01:15:47,877 --> 01:15:49,910
- We accept it. / - We do...

1860
01:15:49,910 --> 01:15:52,010
- But Fukuoka is close. / - Right.

1861
01:15:52,010 --> 01:15:53,777
- You can go there fast. / - It's...

1862
01:15:53,777 --> 01:15:55,710
15 minutes from the airport.

1863
01:15:55,710 --> 01:15:57,510
A cheap trip doesn't mean...

1864
01:15:57,510 --> 01:15:59,110
- It's good. / - That's right.

1865
01:15:59,110 --> 01:15:59,743
That's obvious.

1866
01:15:59,743 --> 01:16:01,310
Don't compare the costs.

1867
01:16:01,310 --> 01:16:03,510
Let's check out your trip first.

1868
01:16:03,510 --> 01:16:04,277
- Should we? / - Good.

1869
01:16:04,277 --> 01:16:05,943
The hot springs were so good.

1870
01:16:05,943 --> 01:16:07,543
- Our skin got better. / - Good.

1871
01:16:07,543 --> 01:16:09,077
I look younger now.

1872
01:16:09,077 --> 01:16:10,343
No?

1873
01:16:11,177 --> 01:16:14,343
It'd be hard to believe

1874
01:16:14,343 --> 01:16:16,210
but she's my age and she's 1 year older.

1875
01:16:16,210 --> 01:16:17,277
This is how young they became.

1876
01:16:17,277 --> 01:16:19,710
- I know. / - It's because of Fukuoka.

1877
01:16:19,710 --> 01:16:21,677
Next week, Fukuoka.

1878
01:16:21,677 --> 01:16:24,043
Look forward to our hot springs.

1879
01:16:25,777 --> 01:16:28,343
(Next episode)

1880
01:16:29,243 --> 01:16:31,043
Fukuoka.

1881
01:16:31,210 --> 01:16:33,943
This is our secret course.

1882
01:16:33,943 --> 01:16:34,977
So pretty.

1883
01:16:35,810 --> 01:16:37,410
I didn't know such a place existed.

1884
01:16:37,410 --> 01:16:40,177
They have over 28 hot springs.

1885
01:16:40,177 --> 01:16:41,810
This is awesome.

1886
01:16:43,177 --> 01:16:44,777
It's getting hot, isn't it?

1887
01:16:45,243 --> 01:16:46,943
We're becoming skin beauties.

1888
01:16:46,943 --> 01:16:48,643
Hot springs are so nice.

1889
01:16:49,510 --> 01:16:50,910
Nice!
