1
00:00:01,576 --> 00:00:04,742
Myanmar feels like a world of mystery.

2
00:00:05,409 --> 00:00:06,209
Wow.

3
00:00:06,976 --> 00:00:07,942
Unbelievable.

4
00:00:10,042 --> 00:00:11,376
I would've regretted not doing this.

5
00:00:12,376 --> 00:00:14,942
Tuhi Trip!

6
00:00:16,476 --> 00:00:19,342
(Healing city, Pai in Thailand)

7
00:00:19,342 --> 00:00:20,942
It's so pretty.

8
00:00:20,942 --> 00:00:22,942
This atmosphere is just so beautiful.

9
00:00:23,776 --> 00:00:25,409
Pai, Pai.

10
00:00:25,409 --> 00:00:26,776
Hey, it's no joke.

11
00:00:26,776 --> 00:00:29,509
(91 votes for Thailand, 82 votes for Myanmar)

12
00:00:30,542 --> 00:00:33,009
(Which team will win?)

13
00:00:34,742 --> 00:00:38,709
(Numerous great tips on trips)

00:00:40,876 --> 00:00:42,042
(Special host, Lee Suji)

15
00:00:43,042 --> 00:00:44,576
(Hongbin and N of VIXX)

16
00:00:45,376 --> 00:00:46,776
(Sojin of Girl's Day, Shin Ayoung)

17
00:00:47,709 --> 00:00:48,842
Travel is war!

18
00:00:48,842 --> 00:00:51,609
Battle Trip!

19
00:00:54,042 --> 00:00:55,609
This is our third week of

20
00:00:55,609 --> 00:00:58,809
the international festival special

21
00:00:58,809 --> 00:01:00,542
and we're joined by our trip planners.

22
00:01:00,542 --> 00:01:02,209
- Welcome. / - Nice to meet you.

23
00:01:04,142 --> 00:01:06,942
Suji is also with us for 3 weeks.

24
00:01:06,942 --> 00:01:07,842
How is it?

25
00:01:07,842 --> 00:01:11,376
I get a lot of information from Battle Trip.

26
00:01:11,376 --> 00:01:15,342
It feels like I'm reading a book.

27
00:01:15,342 --> 00:01:16,609
We published a book.

28
00:01:16,609 --> 00:01:18,942
I see.

29
00:01:18,942 --> 00:01:21,609
Please show a lot of love for the Battle Trip book.

30
00:01:22,542 --> 00:01:25,342
For the last 2 weeks, the results were

31
00:01:25,342 --> 00:01:28,142
91 vs. 82. We have 9 more votes.

32
00:01:28,142 --> 00:01:32,042
The topic is to enjoy international festivals.

33
00:01:32,042 --> 00:01:33,509
- We saved it for today. / - You're right.

34
00:01:33,509 --> 00:01:35,476
You must tune in today.

35
00:01:35,476 --> 00:01:36,176
This is the highlight.

36
00:01:36,176 --> 00:01:37,942
Today is the real match.

37
00:01:37,942 --> 00:01:41,109
After seeing the festivals in Myanmar and Thailand,

38
00:01:41,109 --> 00:01:42,642
the judges will make a final decision.

39
00:01:42,642 --> 00:01:44,009
Traveling is important.

40
00:01:44,009 --> 00:01:45,609
But when there's also a festival,

41
00:01:45,609 --> 00:01:46,709
it's like a buy-one-get-one-free deal.

42
00:01:46,709 --> 00:01:48,009
Right, if you can get the timing right.

43
00:01:48,009 --> 00:01:51,009
If you can, you can really enjoy the festival.

44
00:01:51,009 --> 00:01:53,642
And you also get the basics, the food and

45
00:01:53,642 --> 00:01:55,042
things to see as well.

46
00:01:55,042 --> 00:01:56,642
Look, we've been here for 2 weeks

47
00:01:56,642 --> 00:01:58,276
and there's still more left to watch.

48
00:01:58,276 --> 00:02:00,709
Do you know of any other festivals?

49
00:02:00,709 --> 00:02:03,176
- Ayoung is a bookworm... / - Of course.

50
00:02:03,176 --> 00:02:04,642
- She has all the information. / - Tell us about festivals.

51
00:02:04,642 --> 00:02:05,842
- I... / - Did you read a book on festivals?

52
00:02:05,842 --> 00:02:07,109
In Spain and Mexico,

53
00:02:07,109 --> 00:02:11,276
they strike a bell 12 times on December 31st

54
00:02:11,276 --> 00:02:13,176
in honor of the New Year's Day.

55
00:02:13,176 --> 00:02:15,242
Whenever they strike the bell,

56
00:02:15,242 --> 00:02:16,542
they eat 1 grape,

57
00:02:16,542 --> 00:02:18,609
so they eat 12 grapes in total.

58
00:02:18,609 --> 00:02:19,976
That's interesting.

59
00:02:19,976 --> 00:02:22,676
It's a pity that a year only has 12 months.

60
00:02:22,676 --> 00:02:25,209
It's a pity that a year only has 12 months.

61
00:02:26,476 --> 00:02:29,609
Suji's sad because you only eat 12 grapes.

62
00:02:29,609 --> 00:02:31,609
In South Africa...

63
00:02:31,609 --> 00:02:35,109
They break old home appliances

64
00:02:35,109 --> 00:02:38,542
and furniture on New Year's Day

65
00:02:38,542 --> 00:02:40,142
to get rid of the past bad luck.

66
00:02:40,142 --> 00:02:41,809
I heard that's also a tradition.

67
00:02:41,809 --> 00:02:43,542
These water festivals are for the New Year

68
00:02:43,542 --> 00:02:44,809
but they're held in April.

69
00:02:44,809 --> 00:02:46,876
Thailand, Myanmar, Laos and Cambodia are

70
00:02:46,876 --> 00:02:50,042
Buddhist countries so they use a Buddhist calendar.

71
00:02:50,042 --> 00:02:52,642
That's why their New Year's Day starts in April.

72
00:02:52,642 --> 00:02:54,842
In Korea, the dates for Seollal and Chuseok

73
00:02:54,842 --> 00:02:56,442
always change because of the lunar calendar.

74
00:02:56,442 --> 00:02:57,542
The date for the New Year changes

75
00:02:57,542 --> 00:02:58,509
each year in Southeast Asia.

76
00:02:58,509 --> 00:03:00,809
The festivals are held on April 13th to 15th.

77
00:03:00,809 --> 00:03:02,576
The dates are fixed every year.

78
00:03:02,576 --> 00:03:03,376
- It's a 3-day festival. / - Yes.

79
00:03:03,376 --> 00:03:05,409
The number of people around the world who enjoy

80
00:03:05,409 --> 00:03:06,809
this festival is immense.

81
00:03:06,809 --> 00:03:08,276
In Myanmar, the water festival

82
00:03:08,276 --> 00:03:10,409
starts before New Year's Day.

83
00:03:10,409 --> 00:03:13,176
This year, April 17th is New Year's Day.

84
00:03:13,176 --> 00:03:16,176
So the festival started on April 13th.

85
00:03:16,176 --> 00:03:18,609
We went there and enjoyed the festival on the first day.

86
00:03:18,609 --> 00:03:21,976
There's an interesting origin story of Thingyan.

87
00:03:21,976 --> 00:03:23,942
There's a deity in Buddhism that divides

88
00:03:23,942 --> 00:03:25,109
heaven and hell.

89
00:03:25,109 --> 00:03:28,076
He writes the names of people going to heaven on

90
00:03:28,076 --> 00:03:30,009
a golden register, and those going to hell

91
00:03:30,009 --> 00:03:32,609
on a register made of dog skin.

92
00:03:32,609 --> 00:03:37,076
This deity's weakness is water.

93
00:03:37,076 --> 00:03:39,576
So they splash water on each other

94
00:03:39,576 --> 00:03:40,976
to avoid being written in the hell register.

95
00:03:40,976 --> 00:03:42,809
- Since you can erase on the name on that list. / - Yes.

96
00:03:42,809 --> 00:03:44,242
To erase their names.

97
00:03:44,242 --> 00:03:45,876
I think there must be things

98
00:03:45,876 --> 00:03:47,842
to prepare before you go.

99
00:03:47,842 --> 00:03:50,276
I thought they would splash water with water guns.

100
00:03:50,276 --> 00:03:52,309
But they just directly pour water on you.

101
00:03:52,309 --> 00:03:54,076
- Using buckets. / - Splash, pour.

102
00:03:54,076 --> 00:03:55,542
They use buckets.

103
00:03:55,542 --> 00:03:57,209
- Yes, they pour it on you like this. / - My goodness.

104
00:03:57,209 --> 00:03:58,409
- Yes, they pour it on you like this. / - My goodness.

105
00:03:58,409 --> 00:04:00,842
So you must wear a bathing suit underneath.

106
00:04:00,842 --> 00:04:03,509
That makes it easier to wash as well.

107
00:04:04,076 --> 00:04:06,442
And make sure you use a waterproof bag

108
00:04:06,442 --> 00:04:07,842
to protect things like your phone.

109
00:04:07,842 --> 00:04:09,376
It's similar to Songkran.

110
00:04:09,376 --> 00:04:11,642
I was clueless and thought

111
00:04:11,642 --> 00:04:13,776
they'd announce the start of the splashing.

112
00:04:13,776 --> 00:04:15,942
I left my bag outside of the car as I got in.

113
00:04:15,942 --> 00:04:17,609
To my right.

114
00:04:17,609 --> 00:04:19,609
Then a kid came running to me

115
00:04:19,609 --> 00:04:20,942
with a big smile

116
00:04:20,942 --> 00:04:22,442
and gave me a great New Year's blessing.

117
00:04:23,276 --> 00:04:26,342
There are cars with curtain doors.

118
00:04:26,342 --> 00:04:27,976
The kid opened the door and was like...

119
00:04:29,342 --> 00:04:30,976
- He opened the curtain door? / - A kid?

120
00:04:30,976 --> 00:04:32,509
With a straight face?

121
00:04:32,509 --> 00:04:34,109
He was so happy.

122
00:04:34,109 --> 00:04:36,942
Looks like we'll see some fun footage today.

123
00:04:36,942 --> 00:04:37,742
So the important thing is...

124
00:04:37,742 --> 00:04:40,242
- You should carry a waterproof bag. / - That's right.

125
00:04:40,242 --> 00:04:42,042
You should just leave it at home.

126
00:04:42,042 --> 00:04:43,876
They don't just splash you with water.

127
00:04:43,876 --> 00:04:46,309
There's this popular mango sticky rice snack.

128
00:04:46,309 --> 00:04:47,409
- That's really good. / - Mango sticky rice.

129
00:04:47,409 --> 00:04:49,709
Everyone eats mango sticky rice

130
00:04:49,709 --> 00:04:51,942
during the Songkran Festival, including the monks.

131
00:04:51,942 --> 00:04:55,576
It's just like us eating rice cake soup on New Year's.

132
00:04:55,576 --> 00:04:56,709
You'd think rice and mango

133
00:04:56,709 --> 00:04:58,076
would taste really weird together.

134
00:04:58,076 --> 00:05:00,209
- But they really go well together. / - You're right.

135
00:05:00,209 --> 00:05:00,809
Right.

136
00:05:00,809 --> 00:05:02,609
I really recommend that you try it.

137
00:05:02,609 --> 00:05:03,609
- It was really interesting. / - Me too.

138
00:05:03,609 --> 00:05:05,909
During Thingyan,

139
00:05:05,909 --> 00:05:08,309
all the shops are closed.

140
00:05:08,309 --> 00:05:09,976
Instead, when you go to temples,

141
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:11,709
they have these rice cakes

142
00:05:11,709 --> 00:05:13,909
that are floating on water.

143
00:05:13,909 --> 00:05:15,376
Kind of like a New Year's food.

144
00:05:15,376 --> 00:05:17,276
They hand those out for free.

145
00:05:17,276 --> 00:05:19,476
- Just like our temple rice? / - Yes.

146
00:05:19,476 --> 00:05:20,876
They hand it out.

147
00:05:20,876 --> 00:05:21,942
So you can eat that.

148
00:05:21,942 --> 00:05:23,209
Is it all-you-can-eat?

149
00:05:23,209 --> 00:05:24,509
Is it all-you-can-eat?

150
00:05:26,409 --> 00:05:28,009
- How much do you want to eat? / - Let's go, Suji.

151
00:05:28,009 --> 00:05:29,242
Suji, let's go there.

152
00:05:29,242 --> 00:05:30,576
- Let's go. / - Let's go today.

153
00:05:30,576 --> 00:05:32,842
Are there some key points to look out for?

154
00:05:32,842 --> 00:05:36,909
The key thing to watch out for at Songkran, Thailand,

155
00:05:36,909 --> 00:05:38,876
is our leader, N.

156
00:05:38,876 --> 00:05:41,609
I heard he got into a real fight with some kids.

157
00:05:41,609 --> 00:05:42,476
The thing is,

158
00:05:42,476 --> 00:05:45,809
I don't go wild when I party.

159
00:05:45,809 --> 00:05:48,242
- But you can't do that at Songkran. / - He went all out.

160
00:05:48,242 --> 00:05:49,342
The thing is,

161
00:05:49,342 --> 00:05:51,209
when your water gun is out of water, you have to refill.

162
00:05:51,209 --> 00:05:53,076
And while you do that, the kids...

163
00:05:53,076 --> 00:05:54,376
They spray you.

164
00:05:54,376 --> 00:05:55,509
"Just a sec, kids."

165
00:05:56,976 --> 00:05:58,309
- It can get you mad. / - That'd be annoying.

166
00:05:59,109 --> 00:06:01,542
It's the finale after 3 weeks, today.

167
00:06:01,542 --> 00:06:03,042
We'll decide who wins today.

168
00:06:03,042 --> 00:06:04,842
We have our 100 impartial judges

169
00:06:04,842 --> 00:06:06,509
who will vote on today's trips.

170
00:06:06,509 --> 00:06:07,942
- Nice to meet you. / - Welcome.

171
00:06:10,076 --> 00:06:11,942
You're up by 9 votes.

172
00:06:11,942 --> 00:06:14,809
We're only up by 9 votes.

173
00:06:15,442 --> 00:06:18,009
We'll be combining today's scores to this

174
00:06:18,009 --> 00:06:18,976
for the final result.

175
00:06:18,976 --> 00:06:19,842
You know how it works on TV, right?

176
00:06:19,842 --> 00:06:21,242
It's always more fun if there's a twist.

177
00:06:22,309 --> 00:06:24,542
We watched Myanmar first last time.

178
00:06:24,542 --> 00:06:25,976
Let's watch Thailand first today.

179
00:06:25,976 --> 00:06:26,742
- Really? / - Yes.

180
00:06:26,742 --> 00:06:28,542
- Since we're in the lead? / - Yes, yes.

181
00:06:28,542 --> 00:06:29,776
Okay then.

182
00:06:29,776 --> 00:06:30,776
Okay, everyone.

183
00:06:30,776 --> 00:06:33,842
It's one of the 10 most famous festivals worldwide.

184
00:06:33,842 --> 00:06:36,042
It's the Songkran Festival of Thailand.

185
00:06:36,042 --> 00:06:38,109
I hope you join us and

186
00:06:38,109 --> 00:06:39,376
actually feel like you're there

187
00:06:39,376 --> 00:06:40,876
enjoying the water.

188
00:06:40,876 --> 00:06:42,576
Let's check it out.

189
00:06:45,442 --> 00:06:46,576
5, 6, 7, 8.

190
00:06:46,576 --> 00:06:49,209
Hakyeon, Hongbin, Tuhi Trip. Yeah!

191
00:06:53,509 --> 00:06:55,776
(Pai, the resting place for backpackers)

192
00:06:56,276 --> 00:06:57,676
This is great.

193
00:06:57,676 --> 00:06:59,342
It's like my own hideout.

194
00:06:59,342 --> 00:07:01,809
It's so quiet and you can hear the birds.

195
00:07:01,809 --> 00:07:03,909
The breeze is so nice.

196
00:07:04,509 --> 00:07:07,476
It's hard to see such an open space in Seoul.

197
00:07:07,476 --> 00:07:09,542
They made it so you can relax.

198
00:07:13,576 --> 00:07:15,442
Their water festival started here.

199
00:07:17,442 --> 00:07:21,109
(They said good-bye to the cheerful memories in Pai)

200
00:07:23,342 --> 00:07:24,309
This place is the best.

201
00:07:24,309 --> 00:07:25,876
Now we're in Songkran.

202
00:07:25,876 --> 00:07:27,176
There are so many people.

203
00:07:28,576 --> 00:07:30,776
Dancing while soaked in water. How exciting.

204
00:07:36,009 --> 00:07:37,576
They pour water on you when you're filling up.

205
00:07:37,576 --> 00:07:38,576
They pour water on you when you're filling up.

206
00:07:38,576 --> 00:07:40,442
(Splashed and splashed again)

207
00:07:40,442 --> 00:07:42,142
Can you please stop the car for a sec.

208
00:07:43,776 --> 00:07:45,442
Wow. N is angry.

209
00:07:45,442 --> 00:07:46,242
How courteous.

210
00:07:46,242 --> 00:07:47,442
That makes you angry.

211
00:07:49,976 --> 00:07:52,276
I think we were mostly up against kids.

212
00:07:55,876 --> 00:07:58,442
(2 weeks before they leave, preliminary meeting)

213
00:07:59,276 --> 00:08:01,142
This week's special is

214
00:08:01,142 --> 00:08:03,376
an international festival special.

215
00:08:04,509 --> 00:08:05,376
Festival.

216
00:08:07,609 --> 00:08:09,442
I'll give you

217
00:08:09,442 --> 00:08:11,376
a list of places...

218
00:08:12,176 --> 00:08:13,476
That you can go to.

219
00:08:13,476 --> 00:08:14,342
Thank you.

220
00:08:15,809 --> 00:08:18,609
Pi Mai Festival. Thingyan Festival.

221
00:08:18,609 --> 00:08:19,976
Songkran sounds nice.

222
00:08:21,176 --> 00:08:24,309
It looks like they're spraying water on each other.

223
00:08:24,309 --> 00:08:27,109
It celebrates the traditional New Year's Day.

224
00:08:27,109 --> 00:08:28,776
Thailand considers

225
00:08:28,776 --> 00:08:31,409
April the start of a year.

226
00:08:31,409 --> 00:08:34,042
That's why they greet the new year starting from April.

227
00:08:34,042 --> 00:08:35,909
It's some background information.

228
00:08:35,909 --> 00:08:36,642
It's all written here.

229
00:08:36,642 --> 00:08:38,676
(Self complimenting)

230
00:08:39,976 --> 00:08:41,842
I thought you were reading from this but you weren't.

231
00:08:44,676 --> 00:08:47,242
It's held everywhere in Thailand.

232
00:08:48,009 --> 00:08:51,109
It's held in Bangkok, Chiang Mai, Pattaya, Ko Samui.

233
00:08:51,109 --> 00:08:53,076
I think it's held everywhere.

234
00:08:53,076 --> 00:08:55,342
And the original festival

235
00:08:55,342 --> 00:08:58,642
was based on Chiang Mai.

236
00:08:58,642 --> 00:09:00,809
We should go to Chiang Mai then.

237
00:09:00,809 --> 00:09:01,976
You need to go to Myanmar.

238
00:09:04,876 --> 00:09:08,576
(Chiang Mai, the center of Northern Thailand culture)

239
00:09:09,176 --> 00:09:13,042
(The old capital of ancient Lanna Kingdom)

240
00:09:13,709 --> 00:09:16,942
(Preserved just as it was)

241
00:09:16,942 --> 00:09:18,009
It was really hot.

242
00:09:18,009 --> 00:09:19,509
It looks very peaceful here.

243
00:09:19,509 --> 00:09:20,442
You're right.

244
00:09:21,209 --> 00:09:22,442
- It wasn't peaceful at all. / - Wasn't it?

245
00:09:22,442 --> 00:09:24,542
The place where I went wasn't like that.

246
00:09:24,542 --> 00:09:26,176
Before the festival,

247
00:09:26,176 --> 00:09:27,276
it's peaceful.

248
00:09:30,842 --> 00:09:32,742
It changes completely.

249
00:09:35,542 --> 00:09:40,909
(Held every April to celebrate New Year's Day)

250
00:09:40,909 --> 00:09:44,576
(Blessing each other by splashing water on them)

251
00:09:44,576 --> 00:09:46,409
They splash water cheerfully.

252
00:09:46,409 --> 00:09:47,476
You're right.

253
00:09:47,476 --> 00:09:48,676
It's not like they're fighting.

254
00:09:48,676 --> 00:09:50,876
I want to dance while being sprayed with water.

255
00:09:52,942 --> 00:09:54,076
They did that to my bag.

256
00:09:55,476 --> 00:09:58,009
It doesn't matter if you have a camera.

257
00:09:58,009 --> 00:09:58,842
Right, it doesn't matter.

258
00:09:59,642 --> 00:10:02,542
(Let's go to Chiang Mai, the origin of Songkran)

259
00:10:02,542 --> 00:10:04,042
People think you're strange if you get angry

260
00:10:04,042 --> 00:10:05,142
from getting wet.

261
00:10:05,142 --> 00:10:05,876
That's right.

262
00:10:05,876 --> 00:10:07,442
You looked very strange.

263
00:10:08,809 --> 00:10:10,376
Someone got angry, right?

264
00:10:13,176 --> 00:10:15,442
(Tuhi Trip, day 2 in Chiang Mai)

265
00:10:15,442 --> 00:10:18,742
(Going to Chiang Mai)

266
00:10:19,642 --> 00:10:21,076
(Pai)

267
00:10:21,076 --> 00:10:22,076
(Chiang Mai)

268
00:10:22,076 --> 00:10:24,809
(3 hours by minivan)

269
00:10:25,476 --> 00:10:27,876
(Chiang Mai bus terminal)

270
00:10:29,909 --> 00:10:30,776
Let's go.

271
00:10:33,042 --> 00:10:34,109
- This is it. / - It's so hot.

272
00:10:34,109 --> 00:10:35,409
This is

273
00:10:35,409 --> 00:10:38,709
the bus terminal people arrive in Chiang Mai.

274
00:10:38,709 --> 00:10:41,076
They have what's called a songthaew.

275
00:10:41,076 --> 00:10:42,276
It's a red bus.

276
00:10:42,276 --> 00:10:44,342
We'll take that bus and go to downtown.

277
00:10:44,342 --> 00:10:45,909
There's a lot of buses.

278
00:10:45,909 --> 00:10:49,509
In Thailand, it's the common way to travel.

279
00:10:49,509 --> 00:10:50,609
So it's like a taxi.

280
00:10:50,609 --> 00:10:54,009
It's like a taxi and bus.

281
00:10:54,009 --> 00:10:55,809
- How... / - Is he in?

282
00:10:55,809 --> 00:10:56,409
Sawadikap.

283
00:10:57,476 --> 00:10:58,442
- Hello. / - Hello.

284
00:10:58,442 --> 00:10:59,909
They were all waiting there.

285
00:11:01,609 --> 00:11:02,742
300?

286
00:11:02,742 --> 00:11:03,976
If it's 300...

287
00:11:03,976 --> 00:11:05,042
- That's about $10. / - He's good at communicating.

288
00:11:05,042 --> 00:11:06,942
- We can bargain. / - We can bargain the price down?

289
00:11:06,942 --> 00:11:07,642
Yes, we can.

290
00:11:07,642 --> 00:11:09,042
- You can bargain with public transport? / - Yeah.

291
00:11:09,042 --> 00:11:11,576
It's different to Korean taxis.

292
00:11:11,576 --> 00:11:16,209
The driver sets the price.

293
00:11:16,209 --> 00:11:18,609
The driver said 300 so you should bargain to 200.

294
00:11:19,476 --> 00:11:21,542
You need to go lower.

295
00:11:21,542 --> 00:11:23,676
That's basically a failed bargain.

296
00:11:24,309 --> 00:11:25,776
We felt bad since it was our first time.

297
00:11:26,509 --> 00:11:28,942
280?

298
00:11:28,942 --> 00:11:29,776
Okay.

299
00:11:29,776 --> 00:11:30,909
See? I told you it works.

300
00:11:31,576 --> 00:11:33,776
The price isn't set here.

301
00:11:33,776 --> 00:11:36,009
It's whatever they call.

302
00:11:36,009 --> 00:11:37,476
Thank you.

303
00:11:37,476 --> 00:11:38,209
He readily accepted it.

304
00:11:38,209 --> 00:11:40,642
He probably thought of 250.

305
00:11:41,609 --> 00:11:42,976
Since it was 280, he was grateful.

306
00:11:42,976 --> 00:11:45,142
Right. He even smiled when he agreed.

307
00:11:45,142 --> 00:11:46,609
If you look around...

308
00:11:47,376 --> 00:11:49,342
This place has a different vibe from Pai.

309
00:11:49,342 --> 00:11:51,876
Every store closed today.

310
00:11:51,876 --> 00:11:53,442
- The festival already started? / - Yes.

311
00:11:53,442 --> 00:11:54,476
It was during the festival.

312
00:11:54,476 --> 00:11:57,009
I think the stores are closed for the whole day.

313
00:11:57,009 --> 00:11:58,842
There was no starting point to the festival.

314
00:11:58,842 --> 00:11:59,376
It's just everywhere.

315
00:11:59,376 --> 00:12:00,209
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

316
00:12:00,209 --> 00:12:01,576
- Hey, hey, hey, hey. / - No, no, no, no.

317
00:12:01,576 --> 00:12:02,442
No, no, no.

318
00:12:04,209 --> 00:12:05,976
(Oh, no)

319
00:12:06,242 --> 00:12:07,076
- Hey, hey, hey, hey. / - No, no, no, no.

320
00:12:07,076 --> 00:12:08,042
Just like that.

321
00:12:08,042 --> 00:12:09,476
He's so happy.

322
00:12:11,076 --> 00:12:12,776
You didn't block any of it.

323
00:12:13,976 --> 00:12:16,409
(He only laughs in vain)

324
00:12:17,309 --> 00:12:20,076
This is what the festival is like.

325
00:12:20,076 --> 00:12:21,976
He just came and splashed it.

326
00:12:21,976 --> 00:12:22,876
However, we must smile.

327
00:12:23,542 --> 00:12:24,676
Thank you, kids.

328
00:12:24,676 --> 00:12:25,742
That's not fair.

329
00:12:26,442 --> 00:12:27,742
We weren't even ready.

330
00:12:27,742 --> 00:12:29,876
- I think you should get ready. / - The festival's started.

331
00:12:29,876 --> 00:12:31,876
But they're doing it to wish you good fortune,

332
00:12:31,876 --> 00:12:33,376
so you can't get mad.

333
00:12:34,376 --> 00:12:36,009
That's so funny.

334
00:12:36,009 --> 00:12:37,409
They're merciless.

335
00:12:37,409 --> 00:12:38,576
Look at N.

336
00:12:38,576 --> 00:12:40,442
He's starting to get mad.

337
00:12:41,576 --> 00:12:43,376
- This is so funny. / - That's so not fair.

338
00:12:44,076 --> 00:12:46,342
They do it from inside the car?

339
00:12:46,342 --> 00:12:48,209
I'll open the car door and splash a bucket.

340
00:12:48,209 --> 00:12:48,976
Wait, I shouldn't say that.

341
00:12:48,976 --> 00:12:49,709
Don't be like that.

342
00:12:49,709 --> 00:12:50,576
I shouldn't say that.

343
00:12:50,576 --> 00:12:52,976
- I'm not in the Songkran mood yet. / - Calm down.

344
00:12:52,976 --> 00:12:53,909
Don't get mad.

345
00:12:53,909 --> 00:12:54,809
Not yet.

346
00:12:54,809 --> 00:12:56,309
I'm not into it yet.

347
00:12:56,309 --> 00:12:57,476
You can't get mad here.

348
00:12:57,476 --> 00:12:58,609
Seriously.

349
00:12:58,609 --> 00:12:59,876
Let's calm our anger.

350
00:12:59,876 --> 00:13:00,842
This is Songkran.

351
00:13:00,842 --> 00:13:01,609
Yes, it's Songkran.

352
00:13:01,609 --> 00:13:03,376
Can they splash the water to the back of the taxi?

353
00:13:03,376 --> 00:13:05,542
Even the driver wasn't bothered by it.

354
00:13:05,542 --> 00:13:06,742
- Even the drivers? / - Right.

355
00:13:06,742 --> 00:13:07,609
That's amazing.

356
00:13:09,809 --> 00:13:11,042
Are you heading downtown now?

357
00:13:13,409 --> 00:13:16,209
The people on the trucks are the scariest.

358
00:13:16,209 --> 00:13:17,476
- They're hardcore. / - Yeah.

359
00:13:17,476 --> 00:13:19,942
- No joke. / - They melt ice on the trucks.

360
00:13:19,942 --> 00:13:21,576
To blast you with cold water.

361
00:13:22,342 --> 00:13:24,476
When we go to the street over there,

362
00:13:24,476 --> 00:13:26,476
that's the main street for the Songkran Festival.

363
00:13:26,476 --> 00:13:28,876
Everyone is shooting water over there.

364
00:13:28,876 --> 00:13:31,409
That's right. So we should go over there

365
00:13:31,409 --> 00:13:32,476
and check it out first.

366
00:13:32,476 --> 00:13:33,942
Is it okay to enter there?

367
00:13:33,942 --> 00:13:35,442
Just get ready there.

368
00:13:35,442 --> 00:13:37,309
They just shoot water at the camera.

369
00:13:37,309 --> 00:13:39,042
They don't care.

370
00:13:39,809 --> 00:13:41,409
Check out that hose.

371
00:13:41,409 --> 00:13:42,942
You can't beat that hose.

372
00:13:42,942 --> 00:13:43,476
You have to run.

373
00:13:43,476 --> 00:13:44,676
- That's going too far. / - Isn't that a bathhouse hose?

374
00:13:44,742 --> 00:13:50,642
(The parade signals the start of the Songkran Festival)

375
00:13:51,176 --> 00:13:55,509
(Various parades of traditional clothes and statues)

376
00:13:56,109 --> 00:13:59,976
(Pours the water on their shoulders wholeheartedly)

377
00:14:00,542 --> 00:14:02,242
This is the tradition.

378
00:14:02,242 --> 00:14:04,442
Pouring water on each other's shoulders.

379
00:14:04,442 --> 00:14:05,509
Originally...

380
00:14:05,509 --> 00:14:07,476
- That's so nice. / - That's the normal way.

381
00:14:08,876 --> 00:14:11,442
They say that's how it all started.

382
00:14:11,442 --> 00:14:13,009
That was the start

383
00:14:13,009 --> 00:14:13,842
and it developed to what it is now.

384
00:14:13,842 --> 00:14:15,642
Since it's a Buddhist country,

385
00:14:15,642 --> 00:14:18,176
they splash water on statutes.

386
00:14:18,176 --> 00:14:20,042
- There's this flower water. / - Initially...

387
00:14:20,042 --> 00:14:21,709
- That's how it started, right? / - Yes.

388
00:14:21,709 --> 00:14:23,309
While praying to the statutes.

389
00:14:24,876 --> 00:14:28,809
(They get splashed with water from all over the place)

390
00:14:29,642 --> 00:14:30,709
Now, we should...

391
00:14:30,709 --> 00:14:32,376
Let's go buy outfits.

392
00:14:32,376 --> 00:14:33,642
And join in.

393
00:14:33,642 --> 00:14:34,876
Okay. Let's go, let's go.

394
00:14:39,209 --> 00:14:41,776
Warorot Market is the representative traditional market

395
00:14:41,776 --> 00:14:42,976
of the Chiang Mai.

396
00:14:42,976 --> 00:14:44,376
This place is called

397
00:14:44,376 --> 00:14:46,276
Warorot Market.

398
00:14:47,376 --> 00:14:49,042
Is it a street market?

399
00:14:49,042 --> 00:14:50,776
Yes, indeed. There's a market on the street.

400
00:14:50,776 --> 00:14:52,942
And the inside is all market as well.

401
00:14:52,942 --> 00:14:55,509
We should buy outfits here and get changed.

402
00:14:55,509 --> 00:14:57,642
Let's enjoy the Songkran Festival to the fullest.

403
00:14:57,642 --> 00:14:58,842
This shop has a lot of outfits.

404
00:14:58,842 --> 00:15:00,509
They have goggles too.

405
00:15:00,509 --> 00:15:01,476
Yes, we need to buy these goggles.

406
00:15:01,476 --> 00:15:03,642
You need goggles.

407
00:15:03,642 --> 00:15:05,742
That would've been convenient.

408
00:15:05,742 --> 00:15:06,742
This is 50 baht.

409
00:15:06,742 --> 00:15:07,942
- This is the cheapest. / - You're right.

410
00:15:07,942 --> 00:15:09,276
Can't buy expensive ones.

411
00:15:09,276 --> 00:15:10,976
This is 100 baht.

412
00:15:10,976 --> 00:15:12,409
They're a must.

413
00:15:12,409 --> 00:15:14,476
Let's just buy the 50 baht ones.

414
00:15:15,242 --> 00:15:16,409
Because...

415
00:15:16,409 --> 00:15:17,776
There are a lot of people here

416
00:15:17,776 --> 00:15:18,909
and you'll knock into them

417
00:15:18,909 --> 00:15:20,376
during the Songkran Festival.

418
00:15:20,376 --> 00:15:22,509
So they break easily.

419
00:15:23,276 --> 00:15:24,876
So we don't need ones that cost 100 baht.

420
00:15:24,876 --> 00:15:26,176
Just buy the 50 baht ones.

421
00:15:26,176 --> 00:15:28,909
Let's just enjoy the day with these cheap ones.

422
00:15:29,309 --> 00:15:30,942
We can be practical and wear them just for today.

423
00:15:31,642 --> 00:15:33,409
- We'll only wear them for one day. / - Yeah.

424
00:15:33,409 --> 00:15:35,109
I'll go with the cheaper ones.

425
00:15:35,109 --> 00:15:36,442
I'll be practical.

426
00:15:36,442 --> 00:15:37,909
I'll choose a different pair.

427
00:15:37,909 --> 00:15:39,009
- With a different frame? / - Yeah.

428
00:15:39,009 --> 00:15:40,076
Okay. Let's get these.

429
00:15:40,076 --> 00:15:40,776
They're on me.

430
00:15:40,776 --> 00:15:42,076
That's a great idea.

431
00:15:42,076 --> 00:15:43,109
Goggles are the best.

432
00:15:43,109 --> 00:15:43,642
Here.

433
00:15:43,642 --> 00:15:45,809
Now that we have our goggles,

434
00:15:45,809 --> 00:15:48,142
we should buy outfits that...

435
00:15:48,142 --> 00:15:49,776
- Fit this country, region and festival. / - Okay!

436
00:15:49,776 --> 00:15:52,042
It won't be as fun to just go and buy them.

437
00:15:52,042 --> 00:15:53,176
I'm having plenty of fun already.

438
00:15:53,176 --> 00:15:54,642
Let's choose each other's outfits.

439
00:15:54,642 --> 00:15:56,009
- Choose each other's outfits? / - Yes.

440
00:15:56,009 --> 00:15:57,909
If you can't trust me, you should come with me.

441
00:15:58,542 --> 00:15:59,709
No, no. We'll shop separately.

442
00:15:59,709 --> 00:16:01,909
Let's get ones that suit each other.

443
00:16:01,909 --> 00:16:02,976
I saw the outfits over there.

444
00:16:02,976 --> 00:16:04,342
Okay. Let's see what happens.

445
00:16:06,076 --> 00:16:07,809
For Hongbin,

446
00:16:07,809 --> 00:16:10,276
I'll get a very nice outfit.

447
00:16:12,042 --> 00:16:13,576
Wouldn't he need something like this?

448
00:16:14,876 --> 00:16:15,976
This is great.

449
00:16:18,242 --> 00:16:19,209
Goodness.

450
00:16:19,209 --> 00:16:21,442
We'd carry that too pools back in the day.

451
00:16:21,442 --> 00:16:22,976
Since you need to put your phone somewhere.

452
00:16:22,976 --> 00:16:24,242
- A waterproof bag. / - How much is this?

453
00:16:24,242 --> 00:16:25,476
120.

454
00:16:25,476 --> 00:16:27,176
- 120? / - Yes.

455
00:16:27,176 --> 00:16:28,042
Discount?

456
00:16:28,042 --> 00:16:29,576
No discount. I sell for 120.

457
00:16:30,909 --> 00:16:32,009
She sounds firm.

458
00:16:32,009 --> 00:16:33,142
Please.

459
00:16:34,009 --> 00:16:35,142
Please.

460
00:16:38,576 --> 00:16:39,742
Please.

461
00:16:40,776 --> 00:16:41,909
Please.

462
00:16:41,909 --> 00:16:43,976
- Please. / - No discount.

463
00:16:43,976 --> 00:16:45,209
Please.

464
00:16:46,109 --> 00:16:47,176
Please.

465
00:16:47,776 --> 00:16:49,076
- Please. / - That's how you bought it.

466
00:16:49,076 --> 00:16:51,309
Yeah. Discount.

467
00:16:51,309 --> 00:16:52,542
100 baht.

468
00:16:52,542 --> 00:16:53,909
- 100 baht? / - Yes.

469
00:16:53,909 --> 00:16:55,076
Okay, okay, okay.

470
00:16:55,076 --> 00:16:56,542
I got a 20 baht discount.

471
00:16:57,509 --> 00:16:59,176
He saved 20 baht.

472
00:16:59,176 --> 00:17:01,009
- Thank you. / - Thank you.

473
00:17:01,009 --> 00:17:03,509
100 baht is $3.40.

474
00:17:03,509 --> 00:17:04,442
It's very cheap.

475
00:17:04,442 --> 00:17:07,142
You haggle like crazy and you save like 30 cents.

476
00:17:07,142 --> 00:17:08,642
- That's right. / - Yeah.

477
00:17:09,709 --> 00:17:10,642
What's going on?

478
00:17:10,642 --> 00:17:12,276
Should we take it easy and get a mango?

479
00:17:14,242 --> 00:17:15,609
While I was busy picking his outfit.

480
00:17:16,642 --> 00:17:17,676
I see some shirts.

481
00:17:18,342 --> 00:17:19,409
There are a lot of people here.

482
00:17:20,609 --> 00:17:21,809
How much is it?

483
00:17:21,809 --> 00:17:23,542
199

484
00:17:23,542 --> 00:17:24,676
199?

485
00:17:25,376 --> 00:17:27,309
- Discount please. / - No discount. Last price.

486
00:17:27,309 --> 00:17:28,409
- No discount? / - Yes.

487
00:17:28,409 --> 00:17:29,242
Please.

488
00:17:29,242 --> 00:17:29,876
Please.

489
00:17:32,309 --> 00:17:33,509
You did it too.

490
00:17:33,509 --> 00:17:35,309
190 is okay.

491
00:17:35,309 --> 00:17:36,942
- 190? / - 190.

492
00:17:38,442 --> 00:17:39,942
I saved 9 cents.

493
00:17:39,942 --> 00:17:40,742
She was so firm.

494
00:17:40,742 --> 00:17:42,576
No, no.

495
00:17:42,576 --> 00:17:43,976
- 100. / - No.

496
00:17:43,976 --> 00:17:44,542
One more.

497
00:17:44,542 --> 00:17:45,976
Please.

498
00:17:45,976 --> 00:17:47,409
- 100. / - No.

499
00:17:47,409 --> 00:17:49,542
130

500
00:17:49,542 --> 00:17:51,176
140

501
00:17:51,176 --> 00:17:53,942
Please, please.

502
00:17:53,942 --> 00:17:57,142
120.

503
00:17:57,142 --> 00:17:58,976
Let's go. Let's go.

504
00:17:58,976 --> 00:18:00,442
120?

505
00:18:00,442 --> 00:18:01,376
Okay.

506
00:18:01,376 --> 00:18:02,209
Okay?

507
00:18:02,209 --> 00:18:03,309
I heard that business owners

508
00:18:03,309 --> 00:18:04,276
have fun bargaining

509
00:18:04,276 --> 00:18:06,276
instead of just selling the products.

510
00:18:06,276 --> 00:18:07,909
Don't you think word got around about you?

511
00:18:08,809 --> 00:18:09,842
As the Please Boy.

512
00:18:10,909 --> 00:18:12,709
- Are you back, Hongbin? / - Yes.

513
00:18:12,709 --> 00:18:15,442
- We should present the outfits now. / - Okay.

514
00:18:15,442 --> 00:18:17,109
1, 2, 3.

515
00:18:17,109 --> 00:18:17,976
- The entire outfit? / - Ta-da.

516
00:18:17,976 --> 00:18:18,709
What is that?

517
00:18:18,709 --> 00:18:19,542
Hey, seriously.

518
00:18:19,542 --> 00:18:21,009
This is a hidden item.

519
00:18:21,009 --> 00:18:23,009
First of all, we should each wear this.

520
00:18:24,076 --> 00:18:26,076
- They've become flower boys. / - Tops first.

521
00:18:26,076 --> 00:18:27,142
Tops first.

522
00:18:27,142 --> 00:18:28,809
Are you ready?

523
00:18:28,809 --> 00:18:30,242
Wait. Let me see which one it is.

524
00:18:30,242 --> 00:18:30,842
I'm ready now.

525
00:18:30,842 --> 00:18:32,109
You don't know which one is the top?

526
00:18:32,109 --> 00:18:32,742
I got confused.

527
00:18:32,742 --> 00:18:33,576
Is it that kind of outfit?

528
00:18:33,576 --> 00:18:34,276
Okay, I'm ready.

529
00:18:34,276 --> 00:18:35,476
Okay, here goes.

530
00:18:35,476 --> 00:18:37,109
1, 2, 3.

531
00:18:37,109 --> 00:18:37,942
Ta-da.

532
00:18:37,942 --> 00:18:39,376
They're both flowers.

533
00:18:39,376 --> 00:18:41,009
You two have a similar taste.

534
00:18:41,009 --> 00:18:42,509
- Pant? Are you ready? / - Yes.

535
00:18:42,509 --> 00:18:44,076
- Here goes. / - Yes. 1, 2, 3.

536
00:18:44,076 --> 00:18:44,976
Ta-da.

537
00:18:44,976 --> 00:18:45,609
What is that?

538
00:18:45,609 --> 00:18:46,442
Why? Why?

539
00:18:46,442 --> 00:18:47,476
Ta-da.

540
00:18:47,476 --> 00:18:48,209
What is that?

541
00:18:48,209 --> 00:18:49,076
Why? Why?

542
00:18:49,076 --> 00:18:51,042
It's blue again.

543
00:18:51,042 --> 00:18:52,542
Everyone's dressed like this.

544
00:18:52,542 --> 00:18:53,809
I prepared something else too.

545
00:18:53,809 --> 00:18:55,609
A handbag for you to get attention.

546
00:18:56,542 --> 00:18:58,142
I heard you prepared something so...

547
00:18:58,142 --> 00:19:01,776
This is for you to walk easily through the water.

548
00:19:01,776 --> 00:19:04,009
(What is that?)

549
00:19:04,709 --> 00:19:05,409
What?

550
00:19:05,409 --> 00:19:07,142
- Oh, my. / - Amazing.

551
00:19:07,142 --> 00:19:07,976
It's cute.

552
00:19:07,976 --> 00:19:09,142
It's pretty.

553
00:19:12,176 --> 00:19:13,376
This is so...

554
00:19:13,376 --> 00:19:14,876
This is a nice item.

555
00:19:16,109 --> 00:19:17,576
- It's so... / - That's so cute.

556
00:19:17,576 --> 00:19:19,009
They look like real fish.

557
00:19:19,009 --> 00:19:21,442
You need these slippers to play with water.

558
00:19:21,442 --> 00:19:23,076
It was the biggest size, I had no choice.

559
00:19:23,076 --> 00:19:24,109
- Wait. / - It's kind of scary.

560
00:19:24,109 --> 00:19:25,909
They have pink and purple...

561
00:19:25,909 --> 00:19:26,576
They don't fit.

562
00:19:26,576 --> 00:19:28,076
Did you have to buy one that looks like a real fish?

563
00:19:28,076 --> 00:19:30,042
Who will think he's an idol in these?

564
00:19:32,042 --> 00:19:33,376
His feet look like fish.

565
00:19:34,509 --> 00:19:35,442
This is perfect.

566
00:19:35,442 --> 00:19:38,942
This is for you to walk easily through the water.

567
00:19:40,542 --> 00:19:41,642
They're so good.

568
00:19:41,642 --> 00:19:43,609
I want to buy a pair.

569
00:19:44,442 --> 00:19:45,809
Do you want to try these on?

570
00:19:45,809 --> 00:19:47,609
Why would I wear fish on my feet?

571
00:19:48,609 --> 00:19:50,009
Why would I wear fish on my feet?

572
00:19:50,609 --> 00:19:52,142
How much were the fish shoes?

573
00:19:52,142 --> 00:19:53,842
$5.40.

574
00:19:53,842 --> 00:19:55,309
I want to buy one.

575
00:19:56,309 --> 00:19:58,142
Who would wear fish here?

576
00:19:59,276 --> 00:20:00,509
This was such a great buy.

577
00:20:01,476 --> 00:20:03,009
- I'm angry. / - I'm relieved.

578
00:20:04,142 --> 00:20:05,542
Alright.

579
00:20:05,542 --> 00:20:06,242
This might

580
00:20:06,242 --> 00:20:07,542
come across as outdated.

581
00:20:07,542 --> 00:20:08,876
In order to save time?

582
00:20:08,876 --> 00:20:10,176
5, 6, 7, 8.

583
00:20:10,176 --> 00:20:11,909
Hakyeon, Hongbin, Tuhi Trip!

584
00:20:11,909 --> 00:20:13,276
Ta-da.

585
00:20:14,909 --> 00:20:17,209
Look, his shoes stand out.

586
00:20:17,209 --> 00:20:18,876
Doesn't something smell fishy?

587
00:20:18,876 --> 00:20:20,276
What are you saying?

588
00:20:20,276 --> 00:20:21,709
They look pretty.

589
00:20:23,276 --> 00:20:25,909
They're so pretty.

590
00:20:25,909 --> 00:20:28,542
You should keep them on.

591
00:20:28,542 --> 00:20:30,042
Only three of your toes stick out.

592
00:20:30,042 --> 00:20:33,442
Anyway, we're wearing the outfits but we don't have...

593
00:20:33,442 --> 00:20:34,509
- The most important item. / - Right.

594
00:20:34,509 --> 00:20:36,076
We don't have any weapons yet.

595
00:20:36,076 --> 00:20:38,509
- We'll go to buy water guns. / - Let's go.

596
00:20:38,509 --> 00:20:39,276
Water gun.

597
00:20:40,476 --> 00:20:44,109
(The atmosphere on the street got even hotter)

598
00:20:44,109 --> 00:20:45,242
The people shooting water...

599
00:20:45,242 --> 00:20:47,676
- I'm anxious. / - Remember their faces.

600
00:20:48,476 --> 00:20:49,642
Here we go.

601
00:20:49,642 --> 00:20:50,542
Remember their faces.

602
00:20:53,409 --> 00:20:55,042
I see you.

603
00:20:55,042 --> 00:20:56,309
Okay, okay.

604
00:20:58,842 --> 00:21:01,309
It was very rough on the way to buy the water guns.

605
00:21:01,309 --> 00:21:02,176
So cute.

606
00:21:05,109 --> 00:21:06,942
Water gun.

607
00:21:09,742 --> 00:21:12,476
Your outfit makes me want to splash water on you.

608
00:21:13,742 --> 00:21:14,676
Isn't that right?

609
00:21:14,676 --> 00:21:15,542
- Yes. / - They're so fancy.

610
00:21:15,542 --> 00:21:17,042
We really stood out.

611
00:21:18,442 --> 00:21:21,209
We thought about buying water guns in Korea.

612
00:21:21,209 --> 00:21:23,076
But water guns are also classified as guns.

613
00:21:23,076 --> 00:21:24,942
- We couldn't take it with us. / - That's right.

614
00:21:24,942 --> 00:21:26,709
It looks like a gun.

615
00:21:26,709 --> 00:21:28,742
We recommend buying water guns there.

616
00:21:28,742 --> 00:21:30,642
You're getting soaked on the way to buying the guns.

617
00:21:30,642 --> 00:21:31,609
- That's right. / - Yes.

618
00:21:32,409 --> 00:21:34,576
Here, here, here. Let's hurry up and buy some.

619
00:21:34,576 --> 00:21:35,942
Who is this? Okay.

620
00:21:36,609 --> 00:21:38,642
I heard that we have

621
00:21:38,642 --> 00:21:40,709
to buy expensive guns.

622
00:21:40,709 --> 00:21:42,809
The higher number, the more powerful

623
00:21:42,809 --> 00:21:44,609
and they hold more water.

624
00:21:44,609 --> 00:21:46,542
That's a strong one.

625
00:21:46,542 --> 00:21:48,042
- They shoot far. / - Isn't there a stronger one?

626
00:21:48,042 --> 00:21:49,709
- What is that? / - Okay.

627
00:21:49,709 --> 00:21:51,376
- 5,500. / - 2 please.

628
00:21:52,476 --> 00:21:54,376
5,500 is the most powerful one.

629
00:21:54,376 --> 00:21:56,109
You don't seem to want to haggle.

630
00:21:56,109 --> 00:21:57,676
- I need to buy it quickly. / - We need to hurry.

631
00:21:57,676 --> 00:21:59,809
Please put some water in here, I need to go right now.

632
00:22:01,276 --> 00:22:02,442
- It's powerful. / - Okay, okay.

633
00:22:02,442 --> 00:22:03,709
- Hongbin. / - It sounds different.

634
00:22:03,709 --> 00:22:06,209
Let's go back the way we came and

635
00:22:06,209 --> 00:22:07,976
avenge ourselves.

636
00:22:07,976 --> 00:22:09,276
Let's go. Okay. Go, go.

637
00:22:09,276 --> 00:22:11,942
(Tuhi Trip enjoying Songkran)

638
00:22:11,942 --> 00:22:15,176
(1st step, revenge battle)

639
00:22:19,476 --> 00:22:21,842
(The center of Songkran)

640
00:22:21,842 --> 00:22:23,376
They're so pretty.

641
00:22:25,709 --> 00:22:27,109
- What's that? / - I sprayed him.

642
00:22:27,109 --> 00:22:28,709
I accidentally shot him.

643
00:22:28,709 --> 00:22:30,876
I had my finger on the trigger and I shot him.

644
00:22:30,876 --> 00:22:32,576
I'm pretty sure he did that on purpose.

645
00:22:34,776 --> 00:22:36,242
I didn't know.

646
00:22:36,942 --> 00:22:38,109
- Hongbin. / - I don't know.

647
00:22:38,109 --> 00:22:39,576
I see some targets.

648
00:22:40,276 --> 00:22:41,342
Should we try it?

649
00:22:41,342 --> 00:22:42,976
Should we attack the people on the car?

650
00:22:43,642 --> 00:22:46,876
(They carefully start their first attack)

651
00:22:51,376 --> 00:22:54,709
(Such a commotion)

652
00:22:54,942 --> 00:22:57,409
(These guys are relaxed)

653
00:22:57,976 --> 00:22:59,409
- They look too strong. / - Let's go.

654
00:23:00,309 --> 00:23:01,342
Hongbin, let's go.

655
00:23:04,242 --> 00:23:05,176
Let's go.

656
00:23:07,876 --> 00:23:09,642
You can tell he knows what he's doing.

657
00:23:11,642 --> 00:23:13,076
He's not talking anymore.

658
00:23:13,842 --> 00:23:14,709
What's wrong with me?

659
00:23:15,542 --> 00:23:16,642
What's wrong with me?

660
00:23:18,242 --> 00:23:18,976
Oh, no.

661
00:23:19,409 --> 00:23:20,409
Why are they only shooting us?

662
00:23:20,976 --> 00:23:21,776
Just us...

663
00:23:25,709 --> 00:23:27,642
N was shooting everyone around us.

664
00:23:28,476 --> 00:23:30,609
You really get soaked.

665
00:23:30,609 --> 00:23:31,942
We can't lose.

666
00:23:32,509 --> 00:23:33,542
We can't lose.

667
00:23:35,176 --> 00:23:36,309
No one can attack me.

668
00:23:36,809 --> 00:23:37,742
No one can attack me.

669
00:23:37,742 --> 00:23:39,209
I think everyone is attacking him.

670
00:23:39,709 --> 00:23:40,676
Everyone attacked us.

671
00:23:41,409 --> 00:23:42,442
No one can attack me.

672
00:23:43,009 --> 00:23:43,876
No one can attack me.

673
00:23:45,642 --> 00:23:46,709
Calm down. Calm down.

674
00:23:46,709 --> 00:23:47,609
Calm down.

675
00:23:47,609 --> 00:23:48,476
Calm down.

676
00:23:50,476 --> 00:23:51,442
Where are we?

677
00:23:51,442 --> 00:23:52,542
Calm down. Calm down.

678
00:23:52,542 --> 00:23:53,376
Calm down.

679
00:23:54,342 --> 00:23:55,609
I feel like a kid again.

680
00:23:55,609 --> 00:23:57,276
- Isn't it fun? / - Yeah, it's fun.

681
00:23:57,276 --> 00:23:58,542
Thing is...

682
00:23:58,542 --> 00:24:00,742
- You're already soaked. / - We're just walking...

683
00:24:00,742 --> 00:24:02,742
It's a New Year Festival, right?

684
00:24:02,742 --> 00:24:03,909
So normally,

685
00:24:03,909 --> 00:24:05,342
at home...

686
00:24:05,342 --> 00:24:06,109
I want to get revenge.

687
00:24:06,109 --> 00:24:07,442
At home...

688
00:24:08,309 --> 00:24:09,109
He can't speak.

689
00:24:11,942 --> 00:24:13,109
Weren't you saying something?

690
00:24:13,109 --> 00:24:14,809
- What? / - Weren't you saying something?

691
00:24:14,809 --> 00:24:18,276
People would originally clean their house...

692
00:24:18,276 --> 00:24:20,676
And then enjoy the water festival.

693
00:24:21,476 --> 00:24:22,776
Everyone is saying Happy New Year

694
00:24:22,776 --> 00:24:24,742
as they splash water.

695
00:24:24,742 --> 00:24:26,442
They wish you good fortune with a water gun.

696
00:24:26,442 --> 00:24:27,876
And since everyone is having fun

697
00:24:27,876 --> 00:24:29,609
without getting angry...

698
00:24:29,609 --> 00:24:30,876
(Splash)

699
00:24:31,409 --> 00:24:32,209
I'm so happy.

700
00:24:32,709 --> 00:24:35,809
(Happy New Year)

701
00:24:36,742 --> 00:24:38,576
Hongbin is smiling

702
00:24:38,576 --> 00:24:40,209
but N isn't smiling.

703
00:24:41,342 --> 00:24:43,309
(N is the focus target)

704
00:24:44,376 --> 00:24:45,476
There...

705
00:24:46,442 --> 00:24:48,576
Oh, no.

706
00:24:48,576 --> 00:24:49,976
We were shooting each other

707
00:24:49,976 --> 00:24:52,542
then someone ran over with a box.

708
00:24:52,542 --> 00:24:53,976
So I pretended I wasn't with him.

709
00:24:56,076 --> 00:24:57,742
I was surrounded like that.

710
00:24:57,742 --> 00:24:58,509
The water...

711
00:25:00,876 --> 00:25:03,442
(He's run out of water)

712
00:25:03,876 --> 00:25:06,309
(Takes Hongbin's gun)

713
00:25:06,309 --> 00:25:07,409
That's mine.

714
00:25:09,276 --> 00:25:10,576
Look at him.

715
00:25:10,576 --> 00:25:11,609
N.

716
00:25:11,609 --> 00:25:12,642
Learn to enjoy it.

717
00:25:12,642 --> 00:25:14,209
Why are you so angry?

718
00:25:14,209 --> 00:25:16,142
I may look angry but I wasn't.

719
00:25:21,376 --> 00:25:23,142
All those people only attacked me.

720
00:25:23,676 --> 00:25:24,542
Retreat.

721
00:25:24,542 --> 00:25:26,309
It's because you attacked first.

722
00:25:26,309 --> 00:25:27,176
That's why we retreated.

723
00:25:27,176 --> 00:25:28,509
Let's go there one more time.

724
00:25:29,076 --> 00:25:30,009
I can't let this happen.

725
00:25:30,009 --> 00:25:31,909
It's like some video game.

726
00:25:31,909 --> 00:25:33,542
It was really fun.

727
00:25:34,576 --> 00:25:36,876
Can you get water from anywhere?

728
00:25:36,876 --> 00:25:38,476
You have to pay for some places.

729
00:25:38,476 --> 00:25:41,609
But a lot of stores give you water

730
00:25:41,609 --> 00:25:43,376
during the festival.

731
00:25:43,376 --> 00:25:45,442
- Let's go get revenge. / - Okay.

732
00:25:45,442 --> 00:25:46,376
In the spirit of Songkran.

733
00:25:46,376 --> 00:25:48,276
That's the main corner.

734
00:25:48,276 --> 00:25:48,976
Come with me, Hongbin.

735
00:25:49,676 --> 00:25:50,376
Come with me, Hongbin.

736
00:25:52,576 --> 00:25:53,509
He chases after them.

737
00:25:53,509 --> 00:25:54,609
Chase her.

738
00:25:57,876 --> 00:25:58,676
This is no joke.

739
00:25:58,676 --> 00:26:01,342
She wished you luck with a bowl.

740
00:26:02,709 --> 00:26:04,276
Wait...

741
00:26:04,276 --> 00:26:06,276
He said he'd go hard on the strong

742
00:26:06,276 --> 00:26:08,709
and easy on the weak...

743
00:26:08,709 --> 00:26:09,676
But he went after everyone.

744
00:26:14,409 --> 00:26:16,076
Hey, I'm out of water.

745
00:26:16,076 --> 00:26:16,876
I'm out of water.

746
00:26:16,876 --> 00:26:18,142
Me too.

747
00:26:18,142 --> 00:26:20,076
Did you return there by yourself?

748
00:26:22,942 --> 00:26:23,842
He looks determined.

749
00:26:24,909 --> 00:26:25,742
He just attacks everyone.

750
00:26:30,542 --> 00:26:32,142
Those guys were scary.

751
00:26:34,442 --> 00:26:35,809
(There are too many to take down on his own)

752
00:26:36,476 --> 00:26:37,542
For real?

753
00:26:38,576 --> 00:26:39,442
This is so funny.

754
00:26:39,442 --> 00:26:41,109
That really looks fun.

755
00:26:41,942 --> 00:26:42,809
Did you help him?

756
00:26:46,142 --> 00:26:47,542
Still...

757
00:26:49,809 --> 00:26:51,476
He's helping from behind.

758
00:26:56,009 --> 00:26:56,709
Where are you?

759
00:26:58,142 --> 00:26:58,776
This is no joke.

760
00:27:00,476 --> 00:27:02,176
N, please smile.

761
00:27:03,309 --> 00:27:06,076
This is a festival.

762
00:27:11,709 --> 00:27:12,642
He lost his shoes.

763
00:27:13,642 --> 00:27:16,376
(His fish were abandoned on the battlefield)

764
00:27:17,309 --> 00:27:18,442
He's shooting the fish.

765
00:27:18,442 --> 00:27:19,776
I'm saving them.

766
00:27:20,809 --> 00:27:21,809
I'm saving the fish.

767
00:27:24,542 --> 00:27:26,042
What is this?

768
00:27:26,042 --> 00:27:27,309
He just sprayed the fish.

769
00:27:27,309 --> 00:27:28,042
I need to save them.

770
00:27:31,542 --> 00:27:34,009
You can tell Hongbin is having fun.

771
00:27:40,642 --> 00:27:41,876
So funny.

772
00:27:42,976 --> 00:27:44,309
We...

773
00:27:44,309 --> 00:27:45,242
Here...

774
00:27:47,176 --> 00:27:48,409
You went too hard, right?

775
00:27:49,242 --> 00:27:50,209
I feel totally depleted.

776
00:27:50,809 --> 00:27:52,576
We need to recharge.

777
00:27:52,576 --> 00:27:53,342
Let's get some food.

778
00:27:53,342 --> 00:27:54,576
Yes, let's eat and then fight again.

779
00:27:54,576 --> 00:27:55,476
Let's recharge.

780
00:27:55,476 --> 00:27:56,109
Recharge.

781
00:27:56,109 --> 00:27:57,142
Okay, let's go.

782
00:27:57,142 --> 00:27:58,309
It's dangerous over there.

783
00:27:58,309 --> 00:27:59,476
It's dangerous over there.

784
00:28:01,309 --> 00:28:04,342
(Tuhi Trip, how to enjoy Songkran)

785
00:28:04,342 --> 00:28:07,476
(Snack time)

786
00:28:07,476 --> 00:28:08,909
This place.

787
00:28:08,909 --> 00:28:11,009
It's called Tha Pae Gate.

788
00:28:11,009 --> 00:28:13,042
This is the new town.

789
00:28:13,042 --> 00:28:15,142
If we enter this, it's the old town.

790
00:28:15,142 --> 00:28:17,776
- They divided it with a wall. / - That's right.

791
00:28:17,776 --> 00:28:18,742
From this point on,

792
00:28:18,742 --> 00:28:20,909
it's all food and drinks.

793
00:28:20,909 --> 00:28:21,742
- Let's go. / - Go, go, go.

794
00:28:21,742 --> 00:28:22,676
Let's recharge our energy.

795
00:28:22,676 --> 00:28:23,976
During the festival,

796
00:28:23,976 --> 00:28:26,542
big places like department stores are all closed.

797
00:28:26,542 --> 00:28:28,442
There are street vendors though.

798
00:28:28,442 --> 00:28:30,509
Places to eat in each alley.

799
00:28:30,509 --> 00:28:33,609
You can rest and eat there.

800
00:28:33,609 --> 00:28:36,742
You have to eat this during Songkran.

801
00:28:36,742 --> 00:28:37,709
We planned it out.

802
00:28:37,709 --> 00:28:39,442
- The must-have dish. / - You know it, right?

803
00:28:39,442 --> 00:28:40,242
Mango sticky rice.

804
00:28:41,142 --> 00:28:42,342
Are you eating mango sticky rice?

805
00:28:42,342 --> 00:28:43,476
Mango sticky rice

806
00:28:43,476 --> 00:28:45,442
is traditional food for Songkran.

807
00:28:45,442 --> 00:28:46,176
We looked so normal there.

808
00:28:46,176 --> 00:28:47,442
You have to enjoy a country's culture

809
00:28:47,442 --> 00:28:49,376
and come back to be able to say

810
00:28:49,376 --> 00:28:51,376
that the trip was a successful one.

811
00:28:51,376 --> 00:28:52,176
Right.

812
00:28:52,176 --> 00:28:54,642
So, we must eat mango sticky rice

813
00:28:54,642 --> 00:28:55,776
to enjoy their culture.

814
00:28:56,576 --> 00:28:58,176
Hey, it's mango sticky rice here.

815
00:29:01,876 --> 00:29:04,409
- Hello. / - Hello.

816
00:29:04,409 --> 00:29:07,176
- Hello. / - They were kind and greeted us well.

817
00:29:07,176 --> 00:29:07,876
Mango sticky rice?

818
00:29:10,376 --> 00:29:11,042
But she understood, right?

819
00:29:11,042 --> 00:29:12,709
Yes, she did.

820
00:29:12,709 --> 00:29:13,376
Mango sticky rice?

821
00:29:16,642 --> 00:29:18,176
Two please.

822
00:29:19,109 --> 00:29:20,976
They pour condensed milk on top.

823
00:29:20,976 --> 00:29:21,776
What is that?

824
00:29:21,776 --> 00:29:23,142
That's it.

825
00:29:23,142 --> 00:29:24,809
It's not with actual rice?

826
00:29:24,809 --> 00:29:26,476
- There's rice underneath. / - The rice is on the bottom?

827
00:29:26,476 --> 00:29:28,276
- Underneath. / - Let's eat rice for Songkran.

828
00:29:28,276 --> 00:29:29,576
You mix it with the rice.

829
00:29:29,576 --> 00:29:31,042
Really?

830
00:29:31,042 --> 00:29:31,742
It's really sweet.

831
00:29:31,742 --> 00:29:33,309
Mango sticky rice is

832
00:29:33,309 --> 00:29:36,076
more like a snack than a meal.

833
00:29:36,076 --> 00:29:38,376
It's like a snack you eat during the festival.

834
00:29:38,376 --> 00:29:39,276
Let's try it.

835
00:29:39,276 --> 00:29:42,109
(This is their first meal of the day)

836
00:29:43,842 --> 00:29:46,176
(Hongbin also takes a big bite)

837
00:29:48,609 --> 00:29:50,042
They put mangos,

838
00:29:50,042 --> 00:29:51,376
condensed milk.

839
00:29:51,376 --> 00:29:53,109
- And pine nuts on top. / - So sweet.

840
00:29:53,109 --> 00:29:54,109
- Look at the flakes. / - That's really...

841
00:29:54,109 --> 00:29:56,676
- It's really sweet. / - What an unusual combination.

842
00:29:57,876 --> 00:29:59,909
I thought it wouldn't go well but it goes well together.

843
00:30:01,009 --> 00:30:03,609
It's perfect to eat when you're tired.

844
00:30:03,609 --> 00:30:05,076
It's kind of like ice cream as well.

845
00:30:05,076 --> 00:30:06,176
Ice cream flavor.

846
00:30:06,176 --> 00:30:07,876
The rice is sticky.

847
00:30:07,876 --> 00:30:10,109
- The pine nuts are really crunchy. / - Yes.

848
00:30:10,109 --> 00:30:11,909
I thought fruit and rice

849
00:30:11,909 --> 00:30:14,542
wouldn't go well with together.

850
00:30:14,542 --> 00:30:14,976
How is it for you?

851
00:30:14,976 --> 00:30:16,342
I thought that the rice would taste bad

852
00:30:16,342 --> 00:30:19,376
because the mango is so sweet.

853
00:30:19,376 --> 00:30:21,142
But the condensed milk helps...

854
00:30:21,142 --> 00:30:22,476
Yes.

855
00:30:22,476 --> 00:30:23,809
The fruit go well with the rice.

856
00:30:23,809 --> 00:30:25,776
- It's delicious. / - It doesn't look like a lot...

857
00:30:25,776 --> 00:30:26,942
But you get a surge of energy after you eat it.

858
00:30:26,942 --> 00:30:28,376
- That's right. / - Yes.

859
00:30:28,376 --> 00:30:30,476
You get tired after you play in the water, right?

860
00:30:30,476 --> 00:30:33,442
You can go revenge after you replenish your sugar.

861
00:30:33,442 --> 00:30:34,876
Isn't your revenge over yet?

862
00:30:34,876 --> 00:30:38,309
There were 5 or so people that I needed to get back.

863
00:30:38,309 --> 00:30:39,642
I heard you're going back this year

864
00:30:39,642 --> 00:30:40,976
to get revenge.

865
00:30:41,842 --> 00:30:44,309
- I'll go back next year. / - After your promotions.

866
00:30:45,142 --> 00:30:47,209
Let's eat and go.

867
00:30:47,209 --> 00:30:48,342
To another area.

868
00:30:49,876 --> 00:30:51,276
You're hooked on it.

869
00:30:51,276 --> 00:30:52,876
It was really fun.

870
00:30:52,876 --> 00:30:54,742
I got rid of all my stress.

871
00:30:54,742 --> 00:30:57,109
I've never had the chance to run around like that.

872
00:31:00,276 --> 00:31:01,909
Now that we have a new weapon,

873
00:31:01,909 --> 00:31:03,442
let's go have our second round.

874
00:31:03,442 --> 00:31:05,542
- We improved our weapon. / - You put it on your back?

875
00:31:06,609 --> 00:31:08,009
We can't beat them with this.

876
00:31:08,009 --> 00:31:09,142
We can't beat 12 people

877
00:31:09,142 --> 00:31:10,776
with this water gun.

878
00:31:10,776 --> 00:31:11,809
Something like that...

879
00:31:11,809 --> 00:31:13,509
You want an upgrade.

880
00:31:17,776 --> 00:31:18,576
Revenge...

881
00:31:19,942 --> 00:31:20,676
It's you, kid!

882
00:31:21,276 --> 00:31:22,576
- It's you, kid! / - It's a little kid.

883
00:31:23,509 --> 00:31:25,509
(Splash)

884
00:31:26,909 --> 00:31:28,209
But those stores...

885
00:31:28,209 --> 00:31:29,409
You can't beat them.

886
00:31:29,409 --> 00:31:31,142
They have unlimited water.

887
00:31:34,276 --> 00:31:35,376
Little kids.

888
00:31:36,542 --> 00:31:38,542
(Cute)

889
00:31:38,542 --> 00:31:39,809
Kids, be careful.

890
00:31:40,809 --> 00:31:42,309
They won't go easy on you.

891
00:31:42,309 --> 00:31:44,142
- Not the kids. / - Don't shoot their faces.

892
00:31:45,076 --> 00:31:46,109
So cute.

893
00:31:46,109 --> 00:31:47,609
Their guns won't work.

894
00:31:47,609 --> 00:31:48,742
So pretty.

895
00:31:49,376 --> 00:31:51,509
(I'll help you get mean N)

896
00:31:51,776 --> 00:31:53,609
It was even better because

897
00:31:53,609 --> 00:31:54,976
the kids enjoyed it too.

898
00:31:54,976 --> 00:31:56,409
How fun would it be for the kids.

899
00:31:57,342 --> 00:31:59,842
(It was fun playing with you)

900
00:31:59,842 --> 00:32:01,642
Let's go this way.

901
00:32:02,776 --> 00:32:04,109
It's a massage shop.

902
00:32:04,109 --> 00:32:07,109
Relieve fatigue.

903
00:32:07,109 --> 00:32:08,176
You go get massages like that?

904
00:32:08,176 --> 00:32:09,209
Yes.

905
00:32:09,209 --> 00:32:11,742
But a lot of people went in.

906
00:32:11,742 --> 00:32:12,676
You're right.

907
00:32:13,309 --> 00:32:14,742
It's open.

908
00:32:16,209 --> 00:32:18,042
We're wet though. Can we still get a massage?

909
00:32:19,376 --> 00:32:20,176
Should I ask?

910
00:32:21,476 --> 00:32:22,342
Massage?

911
00:32:24,342 --> 00:32:25,542
Massage?

912
00:32:25,542 --> 00:32:26,209
Massage?

913
00:32:26,209 --> 00:32:26,842
Yes.

914
00:32:26,842 --> 00:32:28,076
Is it just a foot massage?

915
00:32:28,076 --> 00:32:30,042
- They do full body as well. / - They do?

916
00:32:30,042 --> 00:32:31,176
But we just got our feet done.

917
00:32:31,176 --> 00:32:32,109
Thailand massage

918
00:32:32,109 --> 00:32:33,442
is the best.

919
00:32:33,442 --> 00:32:34,909
Their massages are the best.

920
00:32:37,109 --> 00:32:38,309
During the festival,

921
00:32:38,309 --> 00:32:40,909
they welcome customers

922
00:32:40,909 --> 00:32:42,176
even though they're drenched.

923
00:32:42,176 --> 00:32:43,142
I love that.

924
00:32:43,142 --> 00:32:45,642
- Have lots of fun then get a foot massage. / - Right.

925
00:32:45,642 --> 00:32:47,642
Then go back for round 3?

926
00:32:47,642 --> 00:32:49,842
We recharge our feet then go back for revenge.

927
00:32:49,842 --> 00:32:50,976
More revenge?

928
00:32:50,976 --> 00:32:53,076
When will this revenge end?

929
00:32:53,076 --> 00:32:54,509
The foot massage was really cheap.

930
00:32:55,176 --> 00:32:58,876
It's 140 baht for a 1 hour foot massage.

931
00:32:58,876 --> 00:33:00,542
- That's $4.80. / - $4.80.

932
00:33:00,542 --> 00:33:01,976
- Seriously. / - They're so wrinkly.

933
00:33:02,609 --> 00:33:03,342
They're completely swollen.

934
00:33:03,342 --> 00:33:05,042
They turned into fish.

935
00:33:05,042 --> 00:33:06,942
We came to Chiang Mai from Pai

936
00:33:06,942 --> 00:33:08,709
without taking a rest.

937
00:33:08,709 --> 00:33:09,976
We got off and bought outfits.

938
00:33:09,976 --> 00:33:11,509
- Why is your skin so smooth? / - Had fun.

939
00:33:11,509 --> 00:33:13,976
- Your feet. / - We ate.

940
00:33:13,976 --> 00:33:15,109
And now we're relaxing.

941
00:33:16,742 --> 00:33:18,909
Let's relax our muscles here,

942
00:33:18,909 --> 00:33:20,409
restore our energy

943
00:33:20,409 --> 00:33:21,942
and enjoy the Songkran Festival a bit more.

944
00:33:22,942 --> 00:33:24,742
That's so great.

945
00:33:24,742 --> 00:33:26,342
I love those fish shoes.

946
00:33:26,342 --> 00:33:28,476
You can massages 2, 3 times in a row.

947
00:33:28,476 --> 00:33:30,176
You're right. That's still under $20.

948
00:33:30,176 --> 00:33:30,742
It's cheap.

949
00:33:30,742 --> 00:33:32,442
4 massages are less than $20.

950
00:33:34,142 --> 00:33:35,442
I actually fell asleep like that.

951
00:33:35,442 --> 00:33:36,976
- We were so tired. / - It's really tiring, right?

952
00:33:36,976 --> 00:33:39,776
You two are like kids. Having fun then dozing off.

953
00:33:39,776 --> 00:33:41,242
That's right.

954
00:33:41,242 --> 00:33:44,042
- We just got foot massages. / - Yes.

955
00:33:44,042 --> 00:33:45,242
Since we're well-rested,

956
00:33:45,242 --> 00:33:47,409
we must enjoy the last round.

957
00:33:47,409 --> 00:33:49,809
The festival is almost over.

958
00:33:49,809 --> 00:33:52,342
I can see that a lot of people here

959
00:33:52,342 --> 00:33:53,742
are feeling tired now.

960
00:33:53,742 --> 00:33:55,209
The same goes for us, right?

961
00:33:55,209 --> 00:33:57,109
Let's upgrade our weapons one more time.

962
00:33:57,109 --> 00:33:57,909
Again?

963
00:33:58,409 --> 00:33:59,942
You can get a further upgrade?

964
00:33:59,942 --> 00:34:00,976
We can.

965
00:34:00,976 --> 00:34:02,542
Just like the locals,

966
00:34:02,542 --> 00:34:03,642
let's ride a taxi...

967
00:34:04,709 --> 00:34:07,976
(It's a tuk-tuk)

968
00:34:07,976 --> 00:34:09,342
It's an ambush now.

969
00:34:11,642 --> 00:34:14,009
They carry around water like that.

970
00:34:15,042 --> 00:34:16,542
We can't beat those people.

971
00:34:16,542 --> 00:34:17,976
Because it's a drive by.

972
00:34:19,042 --> 00:34:20,042
During the primitive times,

973
00:34:20,042 --> 00:34:21,276
people on horseback always won.

974
00:34:21,276 --> 00:34:22,409
That's right.

975
00:34:23,209 --> 00:34:24,276
If you stayed for 2 more days,

976
00:34:24,276 --> 00:34:25,576
you would've hired a truck.

977
00:34:25,576 --> 00:34:26,342
Of course.

978
00:34:26,342 --> 00:34:28,442
I hear you're taking a fire truck next year.

979
00:34:31,109 --> 00:34:32,809
(Argh)

980
00:34:33,042 --> 00:34:35,076
(Argh)

981
00:34:38,376 --> 00:34:39,442
The disadvantage is

982
00:34:39,442 --> 00:34:40,609
that you can't get revenge.

983
00:34:40,609 --> 00:34:41,742
Because you drive away.

984
00:34:41,742 --> 00:34:43,242
You know those safari tours?

985
00:34:44,609 --> 00:34:46,009
Instead of watching things on safari,

986
00:34:46,009 --> 00:34:47,109
you get soaked.

987
00:34:47,109 --> 00:34:48,142
We can't let our guard down.

988
00:34:48,709 --> 00:34:49,376
What is this?

989
00:34:50,142 --> 00:34:51,276
What do we do?

990
00:34:51,276 --> 00:34:52,209
Seriously.

991
00:34:52,209 --> 00:34:52,976
I'm getting mad.

992
00:34:52,976 --> 00:34:53,642
I'm getting mad.

993
00:34:53,642 --> 00:34:55,376
Hey, they're right there. On the left!

994
00:34:59,676 --> 00:35:03,009
They try their best but it's not enough

995
00:35:03,276 --> 00:35:04,576
I'm so annoyed.

996
00:35:05,909 --> 00:35:07,409
This is no upgrade.

997
00:35:07,409 --> 00:35:08,976
- This is... / - It's a downgrade.

998
00:35:08,976 --> 00:35:10,342
We just have to let go.

999
00:35:10,942 --> 00:35:13,042
This is the downside of the taxi.

1000
00:35:13,042 --> 00:35:15,009
We can't get revenge.

1001
00:35:15,009 --> 00:35:15,876
You get hit and you have to keep going.

1002
00:35:15,876 --> 00:35:18,409
Since we only have one chance, we must focus.

1003
00:35:18,409 --> 00:35:19,642
That's true.

1004
00:35:19,642 --> 00:35:21,842
As you drive along, you reach these streets

1005
00:35:21,842 --> 00:35:23,976
and the cars get backed up.

1006
00:35:23,976 --> 00:35:26,009
- Like this. / - If the car stops there...

1007
00:35:26,009 --> 00:35:27,776
Now you're in trouble.

1008
00:35:29,676 --> 00:35:31,042
This must be like some club.

1009
00:35:31,042 --> 00:35:32,576
Hey, I'm out of water!

1010
00:35:32,576 --> 00:35:33,409
I'm out of water.

1011
00:35:33,409 --> 00:35:34,609
- Oh, no. / - You should've used it sparingly.

1012
00:35:34,609 --> 00:35:36,009
Don't do that.

1013
00:35:36,009 --> 00:35:37,142
You should've used it sparingly.

1014
00:35:37,142 --> 00:35:38,242
Don't do that.

1015
00:35:38,709 --> 00:35:39,742
Don't.

1016
00:35:46,242 --> 00:35:47,909
Can you stop the car?

1017
00:35:49,109 --> 00:35:50,442
So that's how I looked.

1018
00:35:51,476 --> 00:35:53,842
We're enjoying the Songkran Festival to the fullest.

1019
00:35:56,042 --> 00:35:57,242
We had so much fun.

1020
00:35:58,076 --> 00:35:59,209
Too much fun.

1021
00:35:59,209 --> 00:36:01,142
We just did

1022
00:36:01,142 --> 00:36:03,542
everything you can at Songkran in one day.

1023
00:36:03,542 --> 00:36:05,209
Let's go for some beer.

1024
00:36:05,209 --> 00:36:07,642
We're going for some beer.

1025
00:36:07,642 --> 00:36:09,442
I looked up this pub.

1026
00:36:09,442 --> 00:36:11,176
Don't you think I came up with a great itinerary?

1027
00:36:11,176 --> 00:36:13,076
I do want to go to the Songkran Festival once.

1028
00:36:13,076 --> 00:36:15,309
- It's so much fun. / - It looks really fun.

1029
00:36:16,909 --> 00:36:18,042
Right at the end...

1030
00:36:19,909 --> 00:36:21,109
You're going to impress us.

1031
00:36:22,276 --> 00:36:23,209
A pub with a view.

1032
00:36:27,342 --> 00:36:28,609
We finally get to enjoy a glass of beer now.

1033
00:36:32,209 --> 00:36:33,442
It was so packed.

1034
00:36:33,442 --> 00:36:34,976
What a great atmosphere.

1035
00:36:35,676 --> 00:36:36,409
This is so nice.

1036
00:36:38,209 --> 00:36:39,309
He's exhausted.

1037
00:36:39,309 --> 00:36:40,676
You really aged.

1038
00:36:41,576 --> 00:36:43,709
It was exhausting.

1039
00:36:45,542 --> 00:36:47,076
This dish is really famous here.

1040
00:36:47,076 --> 00:36:48,709
This one. We must try this.

1041
00:36:48,709 --> 00:36:50,576
This is Thai fried pork hocks.

1042
00:36:50,576 --> 00:36:51,676
We must try this.

1043
00:36:51,676 --> 00:36:53,676
Is it similar to the German dish?

1044
00:36:53,676 --> 00:36:54,442
Yes, a bit.

1045
00:36:54,442 --> 00:36:56,042
It's like the meat in cartoons.

1046
00:36:56,642 --> 00:36:57,609
We have to drink beer.

1047
00:36:57,609 --> 00:36:59,076
To wrap up the day.

1048
00:36:59,076 --> 00:37:01,509
The German dish is baked and here it's fried.

1049
00:37:01,509 --> 00:37:02,676
That's right.

1050
00:37:02,676 --> 00:37:04,176
This place is really famous.

1051
00:37:04,176 --> 00:37:05,442
It's the Ping River.

1052
00:37:05,442 --> 00:37:06,809
- It's so pretty. / - There are many...

1053
00:37:06,809 --> 00:37:08,109
Restaurants around the river.

1054
00:37:08,109 --> 00:37:08,976
The view is amazing.

1055
00:37:08,976 --> 00:37:10,542
- That's beautiful. / - So pretty.

1056
00:37:11,676 --> 00:37:13,409
Maybe because it was evening but it was

1057
00:37:13,409 --> 00:37:14,442
really cool there.

1058
00:37:14,442 --> 00:37:16,276
Thank you.

1059
00:37:16,276 --> 00:37:17,742
- Let's drink. Cheers. / - Yes.

1060
00:37:17,742 --> 00:37:18,909
You have to drink that bottoms up.

1061
00:37:20,942 --> 00:37:22,509
If you're that exhausted in that weather.

1062
00:37:24,476 --> 00:37:25,142
This is good.

1063
00:37:26,876 --> 00:37:27,942
Your mouth got so big.

1064
00:37:28,909 --> 00:37:30,576
Now, I feel like I'm on a trip.

1065
00:37:30,576 --> 00:37:33,976
Beer tastes the best beside a mountain or river.

1066
00:37:35,042 --> 00:37:36,709
(At last!)

1067
00:37:38,476 --> 00:37:39,842
Is this it? This must be the pork hocks.

1068
00:37:44,976 --> 00:37:45,942
That was the best.

1069
00:37:46,942 --> 00:37:48,609
- Fried. / - That looks tasty.

1070
00:37:48,609 --> 00:37:50,009
That looks so good.

1071
00:37:50,009 --> 00:37:51,542
I want to eat it again.

1072
00:37:51,542 --> 00:37:52,642
Amazing.

1073
00:37:52,642 --> 00:37:54,242
(I want to eat it)

1074
00:37:56,042 --> 00:37:58,042
- Was it really good? / - It was really good.

1075
00:37:58,042 --> 00:38:00,142
- It was amazing. / - It looks like it.

1076
00:38:00,142 --> 00:38:02,176
If it tastes bad, we'd say so.

1077
00:38:02,176 --> 00:38:03,542
It was really good.

1078
00:38:03,976 --> 00:38:05,576
The skin is fried.

1079
00:38:06,309 --> 00:38:07,676
Korean pork hocks have that

1080
00:38:07,676 --> 00:38:10,309
jelly-like texture.

1081
00:38:10,309 --> 00:38:12,676
But here, it's more...

1082
00:38:12,676 --> 00:38:14,042
Crispy.

1083
00:38:14,042 --> 00:38:16,209
It's tender just like boiled pork slices.

1084
00:38:16,209 --> 00:38:21,809
Right. It tastes like boiled pork slices but the skin is

1085
00:38:21,809 --> 00:38:23,009
battered and fried like chicken.

1086
00:38:24,142 --> 00:38:25,709
(Mouth watering)

1087
00:38:25,709 --> 00:38:26,476
When we were filming,

1088
00:38:26,476 --> 00:38:28,676
they scolded us for not showcasing any of the food.

1089
00:38:30,142 --> 00:38:32,242
We were supposed to shoot while we ate.

1090
00:38:32,242 --> 00:38:33,109
But we were so hungry.

1091
00:38:33,109 --> 00:38:36,042
I think it's better since we were playing with water.

1092
00:38:36,042 --> 00:38:38,242
There must be a reason.

1093
00:38:38,242 --> 00:38:39,976
I think this sauce is this restaurant's special sauce.

1094
00:38:39,976 --> 00:38:41,742
I think it depends on how you make your sauce.

1095
00:38:41,742 --> 00:38:44,642
Now, I can admire the view.

1096
00:38:44,642 --> 00:38:47,576
Earlier, because I was so hungry, I didn't think much

1097
00:38:47,576 --> 00:38:50,109
of the river or the pub.

1098
00:38:50,109 --> 00:38:53,042
(Time to feast)

1099
00:38:53,376 --> 00:38:55,809
He starts the conversation then just eats.

1100
00:38:56,576 --> 00:38:57,876
He wanted you to talk a lot.

1101
00:38:58,576 --> 00:39:00,876
He'd say, "I booked this place. How is it?"

1102
00:39:00,876 --> 00:39:02,576
Then as I answer him, he'd just eat.

1103
00:39:02,576 --> 00:39:03,742
I heard everything you said.

1104
00:39:04,809 --> 00:39:05,576
Nice.

1105
00:39:08,009 --> 00:39:12,109
I came up with the itinerary this time.

1106
00:39:12,109 --> 00:39:14,176
I'm curious what you thought about the trip.

1107
00:39:14,176 --> 00:39:18,376
First of all, your itinerary was so different from mine.

1108
00:39:18,376 --> 00:39:21,209
I usually let the nature take its course.

1109
00:39:21,209 --> 00:39:23,642
I hate it when things don't go to plan

1110
00:39:23,642 --> 00:39:25,009
or when you miss the time

1111
00:39:25,009 --> 00:39:26,542
so I normally just didn't make plans.

1112
00:39:26,542 --> 00:39:28,909
I got to relax from my tiring schedule

1113
00:39:28,909 --> 00:39:30,542
and unburden my problems.

1114
00:39:30,542 --> 00:39:32,376
We took our time to look around

1115
00:39:32,376 --> 00:39:36,242
then here, we got all energetic. We burned it up.

1116
00:39:36,242 --> 00:39:38,642
I think we enjoyed it to the fullest.

1117
00:39:39,242 --> 00:39:40,176
The trip is over.

1118
00:39:40,176 --> 00:39:41,676
Let's focus on our album now.

1119
00:39:41,676 --> 00:39:43,409
Hakyeon, Hongbin, Tuhi Trip!

1120
00:39:44,442 --> 00:39:49,909
(The end of the Tuhi Trip in Thailand)

1121
00:40:01,209 --> 00:40:03,942
(Myanmar, Bagan, Yangon)

1122
00:40:04,376 --> 00:40:07,609
Myanmar feels like a world of mystery.

1123
00:40:08,676 --> 00:40:11,542
Myanmar is a land of gold.

1124
00:40:13,176 --> 00:40:14,709
Amazing.

1125
00:40:14,709 --> 00:40:16,342
There's a temple everywhere.

1126
00:40:16,342 --> 00:40:19,976
There's a pagoda you must see before you die.

1127
00:40:20,509 --> 00:40:23,209
Firefighting Tour, bboom bboom.

1128
00:40:23,209 --> 00:40:24,709
This is so nice.

1129
00:40:24,709 --> 00:40:26,276
It feels like a dream.

1130
00:40:26,276 --> 00:40:27,976
This is so beautiful.

1131
00:40:27,976 --> 00:40:30,176
I'm so moved by this.

1132
00:40:32,576 --> 00:40:33,876
How exciting.

1133
00:40:34,109 --> 00:40:36,009
Go faster.

1134
00:40:36,009 --> 00:40:37,342
I'm taking a right.

1135
00:40:37,842 --> 00:40:40,042
Right turn. I'm taking a right.

1136
00:40:40,376 --> 00:40:41,642
- Hey. / - Amazing.

1137
00:40:43,709 --> 00:40:45,709
The colors are so pretty.

1138
00:40:46,709 --> 00:40:48,842
Amazing. This is so nice.

1139
00:40:48,842 --> 00:40:50,742
It's full of charm.

1140
00:40:50,742 --> 00:40:52,109
Amazing.

1141
00:40:52,109 --> 00:40:54,209
I think we can take it there.

1142
00:40:55,542 --> 00:40:57,809
I'm grateful that you enjoyed it.

1143
00:40:57,809 --> 00:40:59,742
I'm grateful that you brought me here.

1144
00:41:00,309 --> 00:41:02,976
Today is my day. Sojin's day.

1145
00:41:02,976 --> 00:41:04,109
It's the day of water.

1146
00:41:04,109 --> 00:41:07,142
So we'll have foods related to water.

1147
00:41:07,142 --> 00:41:08,642
It's delicious.

1148
00:41:08,642 --> 00:41:11,342
- How refreshing. / - So refreshing.

1149
00:41:11,342 --> 00:41:12,442
Cheers.

1150
00:41:12,442 --> 00:41:13,909
Look forward to it.

1151
00:41:13,909 --> 00:41:17,342
You are entering the real world of water.

1152
00:41:18,009 --> 00:41:19,442
It looks fun.

1153
00:41:19,442 --> 00:41:21,342
That's how they spray you with water.

1154
00:41:24,209 --> 00:41:25,276
You're all dead.

1155
00:41:28,209 --> 00:41:31,076
We're going in.

1156
00:41:31,076 --> 00:41:32,209
Look forward to it.

1157
00:41:32,209 --> 00:41:33,376
It's so cool.

1158
00:41:33,376 --> 00:41:34,276
(Thingyan Festival)

1159
00:41:34,276 --> 00:41:37,809
(Yangon traditional market)

1160
00:41:39,209 --> 00:41:40,709
(Sojin and Ayoung enjoyed Myanmar traditional tea)

1161
00:41:40,709 --> 00:41:44,042
Then let's split up and buy our stuff.

1162
00:41:44,042 --> 00:41:45,409
- Where do we meet back? / - 6 p.m.

1163
00:41:45,409 --> 00:41:47,276
Let's meet at that big gold thing.

1164
00:41:47,276 --> 00:41:49,642
- In front of the Sule Pagoda. / - Okay.

1165
00:41:49,642 --> 00:41:51,042
- I'll go this way. / - Okay, you go that way.

1166
00:41:51,042 --> 00:41:52,276
- See you later. / - See you.

1167
00:41:54,609 --> 00:41:58,076
They're setting up the stage for the Thingyan Festival

1168
00:41:58,076 --> 00:41:59,342
tomorrow.

1169
00:41:59,342 --> 00:42:02,676
(The street is busy as if the festival has begun)

1170
00:42:02,676 --> 00:42:04,942
I think this is a popular place.

1171
00:42:04,942 --> 00:42:06,076
How much?

1172
00:42:06,076 --> 00:42:09,142
The restaurants will be closed, so I bought in advance.

1173
00:42:09,142 --> 00:42:10,809
In case you run low on sugar.

1174
00:42:10,809 --> 00:42:11,642
You bought in advance.

1175
00:42:11,642 --> 00:42:15,476
I don't think there's much to accumulate.

1176
00:42:15,476 --> 00:42:17,509
This is what we call emergency food.

1177
00:42:19,442 --> 00:42:22,876
(She easily got emergency food ready)

1178
00:42:26,809 --> 00:42:27,942
(Great!)

1179
00:42:30,742 --> 00:42:33,976
(This encounter is meant to be)

1180
00:42:33,976 --> 00:42:34,842
- It's cilantro. / - Isn't that cilantro?

1181
00:42:34,842 --> 00:42:38,042
The fish is immersed in cilantro.

1182
00:42:39,442 --> 00:42:41,509
- That sauce looks delicious. / - It was so delicious.

1183
00:42:41,509 --> 00:42:42,209
- Right? / - Yes.

1184
00:42:42,209 --> 00:42:43,042
Totally good.

1185
00:42:43,042 --> 00:42:44,642
It's the perfect mix.

1186
00:42:45,276 --> 00:42:46,976
(She can't walk by the street food)

1187
00:42:46,976 --> 00:42:48,442
It's good.

1188
00:42:48,942 --> 00:42:50,109
(I'll eat first and then get ready)

1189
00:42:50,942 --> 00:42:52,809
What are these? They're water guns.

1190
00:42:54,609 --> 00:42:57,742
So I put this around my neck and dance like this.

1191
00:42:57,742 --> 00:42:59,576
Is this the most powerful one?

1192
00:42:59,576 --> 00:43:01,209
This one doesn't look bad either.

1193
00:43:01,642 --> 00:43:02,876
They have something like this too.

1194
00:43:04,176 --> 00:43:08,876
(Surprised)

1195
00:43:09,342 --> 00:43:10,776
My goodness.

1196
00:43:10,776 --> 00:43:11,909
Look at this.

1197
00:43:12,409 --> 00:43:13,609
This is the best one.

1198
00:43:16,576 --> 00:43:19,209
I'll defeat the water goddess.

1199
00:43:19,209 --> 00:43:22,109
Got it. I'll destroy everyone.

1200
00:43:22,109 --> 00:43:24,342
This and the dustpan.

1201
00:43:26,076 --> 00:43:29,309
I'm looking for a water gun and a waterproof bag.

1202
00:43:30,176 --> 00:43:31,576
It's so pretty.

1203
00:43:32,809 --> 00:43:35,776
(These flowers are so pretty)

1204
00:43:35,776 --> 00:43:37,109
What is this?

1205
00:43:40,776 --> 00:43:42,709
Hello, I'm Sandara.

1206
00:43:43,409 --> 00:43:44,809
Goodness.

1207
00:43:44,809 --> 00:43:46,409
Isn't that hilarious?

1208
00:43:47,476 --> 00:43:49,042
My goodness! This is amazing!

1209
00:43:49,942 --> 00:43:52,642
You can shoot really far with this.

1210
00:43:52,642 --> 00:43:54,842
- That's not a water gun. / - It's good.

1211
00:43:54,842 --> 00:43:56,709
Give me that one.

1212
00:43:56,709 --> 00:43:58,442
I should buy that one.

1213
00:44:00,076 --> 00:44:02,909
(Ayoung heads to Sule Pagoda)

1214
00:44:03,242 --> 00:44:07,176
- Huh? / - Ayoung.

1215
00:44:08,976 --> 00:44:10,209
What is this?

1216
00:44:11,476 --> 00:44:13,042
What is this?

1217
00:44:13,042 --> 00:44:16,509
This is the weapon I'm going to use tomorrow.

1218
00:44:16,509 --> 00:44:18,242
Is it? That's amazing.

1219
00:44:18,242 --> 00:44:20,109
- Isn't it great? / - Is it just a regular dustpan?

1220
00:44:20,109 --> 00:44:21,876
They must spray water with this too.

1221
00:44:24,176 --> 00:44:25,409
Wait a minute.

1222
00:44:27,042 --> 00:44:28,376
Hey!

1223
00:44:28,376 --> 00:44:31,509
-  What's wrong? / - Hey, wait a minute.

1224
00:44:31,509 --> 00:44:33,709
Unbelievable. Let me see.

1225
00:44:33,709 --> 00:44:35,442
I can carry this around.

1226
00:44:36,342 --> 00:44:38,776
Are you here to farm?

1227
00:44:40,542 --> 00:44:42,942
That's Sojin's water gun.

1228
00:44:42,942 --> 00:44:44,509
Is it a water gun?

1229
00:44:45,509 --> 00:44:47,542
- Hey. / - Isn't it amazing?

1230
00:44:47,542 --> 00:44:48,942
It shoots really far and

1231
00:44:48,942 --> 00:44:51,176
sprays water everywhere.

1232
00:44:51,176 --> 00:44:53,276
- Show me yours. What did you buy? / - No...

1233
00:44:53,276 --> 00:44:55,409
I just bought one dustpan.

1234
00:44:55,409 --> 00:44:59,009
Let me see. It matches our firefighter theme.

1235
00:44:59,909 --> 00:45:03,076
You can't keep pumping like this. Your arms will hurt.

1236
00:45:03,076 --> 00:45:07,009
Well, I thought this was a good idea when I bought it.

1237
00:45:07,009 --> 00:45:08,542
Forget it. We should enjoy it.

1238
00:45:08,542 --> 00:45:10,542
It's a bit... You're right. It's a bit lame.

1239
00:45:10,542 --> 00:45:14,376
You have a dustpan shield and a water gun.

1240
00:45:15,409 --> 00:45:16,442
It's a warzone.

1241
00:45:16,442 --> 00:45:17,742
That's a cute water gun.

1242
00:45:17,742 --> 00:45:19,009
Compared to us.

1243
00:45:19,009 --> 00:45:20,442
They're so nice.

1244
00:45:22,742 --> 00:45:24,209
I don't think so.

1245
00:45:24,609 --> 00:45:26,076
They don't look so nice now.

1246
00:45:26,809 --> 00:45:28,109
She's angry.

1247
00:45:28,109 --> 00:45:30,976
Ayoung is a little upset.

1248
00:45:32,042 --> 00:45:34,609
(It really stands out)

1249
00:45:34,609 --> 00:45:35,876
Isn't that it?

1250
00:45:36,909 --> 00:45:38,576
She holds it with her feet.

1251
00:45:38,576 --> 00:45:39,776
It must be very powerful.

1252
00:45:39,776 --> 00:45:40,676
Is it?

1253
00:45:41,176 --> 00:45:43,709
(It really stands out)

1254
00:45:44,109 --> 00:45:46,342
(It will soon be unveiled)

1255
00:45:46,342 --> 00:45:48,709
- Shall we go now? / - So we bought water guns.

1256
00:45:48,709 --> 00:45:51,109
- We bought food as well. / - Right. I think it's this way.

1257
00:45:51,109 --> 00:45:53,576
There were many cute and interesting things.

1258
00:45:53,576 --> 00:45:55,109
Lots to see.

1259
00:46:00,442 --> 00:46:04,842
(It's the morning of Thingyan Festival)

1260
00:46:06,076 --> 00:46:08,909
(Where are Sojin and Ayoung now?)

1261
00:46:10,576 --> 00:46:12,542
Don't you think this is unfair?

1262
00:46:13,009 --> 00:46:14,709
You'll beat everyone.

1263
00:46:15,409 --> 00:46:17,176
It's going to shock everyone.

1264
00:46:17,176 --> 00:46:18,142
Isn't it awesome?

1265
00:46:18,142 --> 00:46:21,009
It doesn't look like it'll shoot with pressure.

1266
00:46:21,009 --> 00:46:22,576
- Doesn't it spray like a fountain? / - It'll spread out.

1267
00:46:22,576 --> 00:46:25,342
You can adjust the nozzle to shoot straight.

1268
00:46:25,342 --> 00:46:26,276
That's amazing.

1269
00:46:26,276 --> 00:46:27,309
That's going to be so strong.

1270
00:46:27,309 --> 00:46:29,042
I think you're going to be a star in Myanmar.

1271
00:46:29,042 --> 00:46:31,209
My dream is to be Iron Man.

1272
00:46:32,642 --> 00:46:34,642
Like this.

1273
00:46:36,676 --> 00:46:38,842
(What a funny friend)

1274
00:46:40,342 --> 00:46:41,709
So pretty.

1275
00:46:42,542 --> 00:46:44,442
Let's get ready to go out.

1276
00:46:44,442 --> 00:46:46,542
- Amazing. / - So pretty.

1277
00:46:47,642 --> 00:46:49,042
It's already started.

1278
00:46:49,042 --> 00:46:51,042
What is that?

1279
00:46:51,676 --> 00:46:52,876
I wish I had something like that.

1280
00:46:52,876 --> 00:46:54,342
They have lots of the latest equipment.

1281
00:46:54,342 --> 00:46:56,742
They're so prepared.

1282
00:46:56,742 --> 00:46:58,342
It's already started.

1283
00:46:58,809 --> 00:47:01,676
It goes for the entire day.

1284
00:47:01,676 --> 00:47:02,842
It starts at 7 a.m.

1285
00:47:02,842 --> 00:47:05,142
It's different since they're the original festival.

1286
00:47:05,142 --> 00:47:07,476
I thought your festival was more upgraded.

1287
00:47:08,776 --> 00:47:10,109
They just gather in one place...

1288
00:47:10,109 --> 00:47:11,876
- And spray. / - It's upgraded.

1289
00:47:11,876 --> 00:47:13,742
(Preview of Thingyan Festival)

1290
00:47:14,576 --> 00:47:17,342
There's the main street where this festival is held.

1291
00:47:17,342 --> 00:47:19,476
Do we have to go there now?

1292
00:47:19,476 --> 00:47:23,009
This is the street. We're soon near Sule Pagoda.

1293
00:47:23,009 --> 00:47:24,509
- Is that it? / - Yes.

1294
00:47:26,576 --> 00:47:29,276
People are riding trucks there.

1295
00:47:29,776 --> 00:47:31,676
That's how they splash water at each other?

1296
00:47:31,676 --> 00:47:35,142
They carry buckets full of water on the truck.

1297
00:47:35,142 --> 00:47:37,309
There are a lot of festivals.

1298
00:47:37,309 --> 00:47:40,809
It must be festival season in Southeast Asia.

1299
00:47:40,809 --> 00:47:43,042
Laos also has a water festival.

1300
00:47:43,042 --> 00:47:45,309
Myanmar has one too.

1301
00:47:45,309 --> 00:47:49,109
- Cambodia. / - There are so many water festivals.

1302
00:47:49,609 --> 00:47:50,309
It looks fun.

1303
00:47:50,309 --> 00:47:55,576
The original water festival

1304
00:47:55,576 --> 00:47:57,642
is Myanmar.

1305
00:47:57,642 --> 00:47:59,342
Lots of people go to Songkran

1306
00:47:59,342 --> 00:48:01,442
because it's the most famous.

1307
00:48:01,442 --> 00:48:03,776
- Where's the original? / - Myanmar.

1308
00:48:06,509 --> 00:48:08,842
(Thingyan literally means to splash water)

1309
00:48:08,842 --> 00:48:10,909
(Songkran Festival is the most famous)

1310
00:48:10,909 --> 00:48:13,042
(But the original is the Thingyan Festival in Myanmar)

1311
00:48:13,042 --> 00:48:14,342
The original is Myanmar.

1312
00:48:15,976 --> 00:48:17,942
(They celebrate for 4 days before New Year's)

1313
00:48:17,942 --> 00:48:19,709
It's a big festival.

1314
00:48:23,009 --> 00:48:25,509
(Everyone gets together and unites)

1315
00:48:25,509 --> 00:48:26,776
It's a rainbow.

1316
00:48:30,076 --> 00:48:33,109
They have a proper stage there.

1317
00:48:33,109 --> 00:48:34,342
Yes.

1318
00:48:39,042 --> 00:48:45,909
(It's the original water festival)

1319
00:48:48,009 --> 00:48:50,776
You just shoot water at everyone.

1320
00:48:50,776 --> 00:48:53,176
I didn't have time to reload my water gun.

1321
00:48:57,576 --> 00:48:59,409
Where are we, Sojin?

1322
00:49:00,576 --> 00:49:02,509
(This is Thingyan Festival)

1323
00:49:02,509 --> 00:49:04,276
We're on a battlefield.

1324
00:49:04,742 --> 00:49:06,909
- It's from here? / - Yeah.

1325
00:49:10,442 --> 00:49:13,142
(Preview of Thingyan Festival)

1326
00:49:13,142 --> 00:49:16,009
If you're not on the main street, you don't get wet?

1327
00:49:16,009 --> 00:49:17,909
No, you still get wet.

1328
00:49:17,909 --> 00:49:19,809
But the main street is...

1329
00:49:19,809 --> 00:49:21,942
- The real fight. / - The main stage.

1330
00:49:22,776 --> 00:49:25,142
(People are enjoying the water festival)

1331
00:49:25,142 --> 00:49:26,276
So that's how they splash water.

1332
00:49:29,176 --> 00:49:30,842
That's not the main street.

1333
00:49:30,842 --> 00:49:32,476
- That's not the main street? / - No, it's not.

1334
00:49:32,476 --> 00:49:34,442
That's just a preview.

1335
00:49:34,442 --> 00:49:36,742
- Are you ready? / - Wait a minute.

1336
00:49:37,542 --> 00:49:38,776
They keep shooting Ayoung.

1337
00:49:38,776 --> 00:49:41,342
Isn't she the best kind of person to fool around with?

1338
00:49:41,342 --> 00:49:43,576
- She's got good reactions. / - She does.

1339
00:49:43,576 --> 00:49:46,142
If you just stare after getting splashed, they'd stop.

1340
00:49:50,309 --> 00:49:51,809
So mischievous.

1341
00:49:51,809 --> 00:49:54,142
- She reacts so well. / - What's going on?

1342
00:49:54,142 --> 00:49:56,942
Where's the water? Find the water.

1343
00:50:00,176 --> 00:50:02,909
I don't even know where it's coming from.

1344
00:50:05,009 --> 00:50:06,509
I found water.

1345
00:50:07,409 --> 00:50:09,076
(This is the pool Sojin was looking for)

1346
00:50:09,576 --> 00:50:11,809
(Pools are everywhere on the side street)

1347
00:50:12,176 --> 00:50:13,242
I found water.

1348
00:50:13,842 --> 00:50:17,209
(How dare you want my water?)

1349
00:50:17,476 --> 00:50:19,109
Timeout! Timeout!

1350
00:50:19,109 --> 00:50:19,876
I surrender.

1351
00:50:20,476 --> 00:50:23,409
(No mercy)

1352
00:50:23,409 --> 00:50:24,842
That girl...

1353
00:50:25,376 --> 00:50:26,842
She jumped in the air.

1354
00:50:29,342 --> 00:50:31,176
(She hurries over to the pool)

1355
00:50:32,542 --> 00:50:34,409
You're so dead.

1356
00:50:35,909 --> 00:50:37,709
They really didn't think much of us.

1357
00:50:37,709 --> 00:50:39,042
You don't have much water.

1358
00:50:39,042 --> 00:50:41,542
That's why the children gave water to us.

1359
00:50:41,909 --> 00:50:45,509
(The people don't wait for them to fill up)

1360
00:50:45,509 --> 00:50:47,176
(Help me, Ayoung)

1361
00:50:47,176 --> 00:50:49,342
It's really like that. People keep pouring water on you

1362
00:50:49,342 --> 00:50:50,442
while you fill your water gun.

1363
00:50:50,442 --> 00:50:51,876
Ayoung is angry.

1364
00:50:52,376 --> 00:50:53,976
She looks like she could faint.

1365
00:50:53,976 --> 00:50:56,476
This was my secret weapon.

1366
00:50:58,009 --> 00:50:59,376
This is the best.

1367
00:51:00,276 --> 00:51:02,876
I'll beat everyone with this.

1368
00:51:02,876 --> 00:51:05,442
What will you do about this?

1369
00:51:07,442 --> 00:51:11,109
(She excitedly defends Sojin)

1370
00:51:12,676 --> 00:51:13,876
Where did it go'?

1371
00:51:17,009 --> 00:51:18,576
It was too heavy.

1372
00:51:18,576 --> 00:51:21,076
Ayoung is pretty clumsy, isn't she?

1373
00:51:21,076 --> 00:51:22,276
She's so funny.

1374
00:51:22,276 --> 00:51:25,209
- I thought she was smart. / - Me too.

1375
00:51:25,209 --> 00:51:27,142
I didn't know she was this funny.

1376
00:51:27,142 --> 00:51:29,442
- She's so clumsy. / - The children kept attacking us.

1377
00:51:29,442 --> 00:51:30,242
That's right.

1378
00:51:31,276 --> 00:51:35,042
(She lost her dustpan)

1379
00:51:35,809 --> 00:51:38,142
(All she can rely on now is Sojin's water gun)

1380
00:51:38,609 --> 00:51:40,242
Don't shoot into my nostrils.

1381
00:51:40,242 --> 00:51:42,809
- Did you fill it in? / - Yes, they're so dead now.

1382
00:51:42,809 --> 00:51:44,576
Her water tank is finally full.

1383
00:51:44,576 --> 00:51:45,742
Yes, it's full now.

1384
00:51:46,542 --> 00:51:48,442
- Hey. / - Isn't this too incredible?

1385
00:51:48,442 --> 00:51:49,709
It shoots very far and

1386
00:51:49,709 --> 00:51:51,909
sprays a lot.

1387
00:51:51,909 --> 00:51:53,776
I think you'll beat everyone.

1388
00:51:53,776 --> 00:51:55,576
Bring on all of Myanmar.

1389
00:51:56,176 --> 00:51:57,742
It's full now.

1390
00:51:58,542 --> 00:52:00,009
Why won't it work?

1391
00:52:00,009 --> 00:52:02,242
- It doesn't work. / - You should pump it first.

1392
00:52:02,242 --> 00:52:06,142
(They're both flustered by their weapons of choice)

1393
00:52:06,142 --> 00:52:07,776
They're in big trouble.

1394
00:52:07,776 --> 00:52:09,309
I was so flustered.

1395
00:52:10,709 --> 00:52:12,376
I was so thankful to her.

1396
00:52:12,376 --> 00:52:13,676
You need to pump it.

1397
00:52:13,676 --> 00:52:15,309
That's the girl that sprayed you with gusto earlier.

1398
00:52:15,309 --> 00:52:17,876
- It's the one that flew in the air. / - That's right.

1399
00:52:17,876 --> 00:52:19,042
But it's like that there.

1400
00:52:19,042 --> 00:52:21,342
The enemies become your allies.

1401
00:52:21,342 --> 00:52:23,976
- You have fun and you help each other out. / - Right.

1402
00:52:23,976 --> 00:52:28,609
(Water goddess pumps fiercely)

1403
00:52:31,776 --> 00:52:35,209
(Why won't the water come out?)

1404
00:52:37,576 --> 00:52:38,909
Did you just laugh at me?

1405
00:52:40,676 --> 00:52:41,909
Did you just laugh at me?

1406
00:52:41,909 --> 00:52:46,009
(She pumps hard to take revenge)

1407
00:52:47,376 --> 00:52:48,542
Look at her use her feet.

1408
00:52:48,542 --> 00:52:50,609
Primates are good with their feet.

1409
00:52:51,809 --> 00:52:54,176
That's so secure.

1410
00:52:54,176 --> 00:52:55,976
- She's grabbing with her feet. / - Yes.

1411
00:52:55,976 --> 00:52:57,776
She's grabbing it with her feet.

1412
00:52:57,776 --> 00:53:02,109
(Filled with bloodlust)

1413
00:53:03,976 --> 00:53:05,176
Does it work now?

1414
00:53:05,809 --> 00:53:06,776
Go!

1415
00:53:06,776 --> 00:53:08,442
Why won't it work?

1416
00:53:08,442 --> 00:53:10,309
I can't wait to see it working.

1417
00:53:11,476 --> 00:53:13,209
You, come here.

1418
00:53:16,276 --> 00:53:18,409
What is going on here?

1419
00:53:18,409 --> 00:53:20,109
It's like she's holding a water tank.

1420
00:53:23,176 --> 00:53:25,176
- They got owned. / - What is that?

1421
00:53:25,176 --> 00:53:28,109
They don't just use water. They spray foam.

1422
00:53:28,109 --> 00:53:30,042
- And all sorts of stuff. / - That's right.

1423
00:53:30,042 --> 00:53:32,309
Goodness.

1424
00:53:32,876 --> 00:53:36,276
You provided lots of laughs for the people of Myanmar.

1425
00:53:36,276 --> 00:53:38,309
It's completely useless.

1426
00:53:38,309 --> 00:53:40,742
You can't use any of the equipment you prepared.

1427
00:53:41,676 --> 00:53:43,442
I surrender.

1428
00:53:46,509 --> 00:53:49,709
This had better be a good year for me!

1429
00:53:50,309 --> 00:53:56,176
(Thingyan Festival will wash away your misfortune)

1430
00:53:57,942 --> 00:54:00,042
They really blessed us.

1431
00:54:00,042 --> 00:54:01,376
We were really blessed.

1432
00:54:01,376 --> 00:54:04,109
They say, "Happy New Year" as they spray you.

1433
00:54:04,676 --> 00:54:06,442
The festival has started in the main street.

1434
00:54:06,442 --> 00:54:07,876
Wasn't this it?

1435
00:54:08,376 --> 00:54:09,609
It's just begun?

1436
00:54:09,609 --> 00:54:11,976
- The real deal is still left. / - What?

1437
00:54:11,976 --> 00:54:14,042
Not this?

1438
00:54:14,042 --> 00:54:17,409
- Are you okay? / - Do I look okay to you?

1439
00:54:18,509 --> 00:54:20,142
Let's go.

1440
00:54:20,142 --> 00:54:21,676
They're going back?

1441
00:54:21,676 --> 00:54:23,909
- To the main street. / - That wasn't the main street.

1442
00:54:24,676 --> 00:54:26,076
Now the practice is over,

1443
00:54:26,076 --> 00:54:27,509
you're going to the main street.

1444
00:54:27,509 --> 00:54:29,042
You already look exhausted.

1445
00:54:29,042 --> 00:54:30,676
Without any weapons.

1446
00:54:32,476 --> 00:54:34,409
I can't pull myself together.

1447
00:54:34,409 --> 00:54:36,276
Should we ask if we could ride on the truck?

1448
00:54:36,276 --> 00:54:38,076
You want to ride that?

1449
00:54:38,076 --> 00:54:40,576
It's so hot that you dry up after a short walk.

1450
00:54:41,676 --> 00:54:42,776
- It was same for us. / - Can we get on?

1451
00:54:42,776 --> 00:54:45,109
- You dry up after a short while. / - It's so hot.

1452
00:54:45,376 --> 00:54:46,942
Is it safe?

1453
00:54:47,409 --> 00:54:48,409
Do we sit here?

1454
00:54:48,409 --> 00:54:50,876
They were a big family.

1455
00:54:51,442 --> 00:54:53,442
- They drive by the street? / - Yes.

1456
00:54:53,442 --> 00:54:55,209
This is good.

1457
00:54:55,209 --> 00:54:57,076
This is really worth trying.

1458
00:54:57,076 --> 00:54:58,042
That's like going through a car wash

1459
00:54:58,042 --> 00:54:59,809
with the doors open.

1460
00:55:00,976 --> 00:55:03,076
(Excited)

1461
00:55:07,009 --> 00:55:10,276
They splash you as they say hello.

1462
00:55:11,942 --> 00:55:14,842
It's great if you can get a ride like us.

1463
00:55:14,842 --> 00:55:17,276
But even if you can't, you can rent it for

1464
00:55:17,276 --> 00:55:18,709
$100 a day.

1465
00:55:21,709 --> 00:55:25,842
(Main street of Thingyan Festival)

1466
00:55:28,076 --> 00:55:28,942
Wow.

1467
00:55:31,742 --> 00:55:32,976
Amazing.

1468
00:55:33,776 --> 00:55:35,842
This is amazing.

1469
00:55:35,842 --> 00:55:38,276
My gosh, I'm so excited!

1470
00:55:38,709 --> 00:55:40,342
This looks incredible.

1471
00:55:41,476 --> 00:55:43,276
It looks amazing indeed.

1472
00:55:44,109 --> 00:55:47,309
What we had before was nothing.

1473
00:55:47,309 --> 00:55:49,942
We're now really going to the water festival.

1474
00:55:51,776 --> 00:55:54,542
- I'll protect you, Ayoung. / - I'll destroy them.

1475
00:55:55,942 --> 00:55:58,042
- You defend, I'll attack. / - Okay.

1476
00:56:00,042 --> 00:56:06,809
(People won't stop pouring water at each other)

1477
00:56:08,009 --> 00:56:10,642
I hear EDM.

1478
00:56:12,176 --> 00:56:16,642
(The music excites Sojin and Ayoung)

1479
00:56:18,942 --> 00:56:20,409
It's so cold.

1480
00:56:22,776 --> 00:56:24,642
We're now in the main stage.

1481
00:56:24,642 --> 00:56:27,142
- That's still not the main stage. / - Not yet.

1482
00:56:27,542 --> 00:56:29,342
It's coming up.

1483
00:56:29,342 --> 00:56:31,409
There's a traffic jam here.

1484
00:56:37,242 --> 00:56:39,476
Do you see that?

1485
00:56:42,342 --> 00:56:44,609
From both sides...

1486
00:56:47,476 --> 00:56:49,776
- It's like art. / - That's pretty.

1487
00:56:49,776 --> 00:56:52,009
- It's a water cave. / - They use hoses.

1488
00:56:52,009 --> 00:56:53,842
Here we go.

1489
00:56:53,842 --> 00:56:54,976
We're going in.

1490
00:56:55,476 --> 00:56:59,042
Everyone, welcome to the real water world.

1491
00:57:01,842 --> 00:57:03,809
You just get soaked in there, right?

1492
00:57:03,809 --> 00:57:04,642
You go to get soaked.

1493
00:57:04,642 --> 00:57:06,009
That's right.

1494
00:57:06,009 --> 00:57:07,376
We're going in now.

1495
00:57:10,842 --> 00:57:12,509
This is nothing.

1496
00:57:12,509 --> 00:57:13,642
- Really? / - Yes.

1497
00:57:17,176 --> 00:57:19,042
It's different there.

1498
00:57:20,042 --> 00:57:23,509
(This is just the beginning of the main street)

1499
00:57:24,909 --> 00:57:29,842
(Will they make it out alive?)

1500
00:57:31,409 --> 00:57:35,676
(The stream of water become stronger)

1501
00:57:36,609 --> 00:57:39,176
You need goggles in there.

1502
00:57:39,176 --> 00:57:40,476
I know.

1503
00:57:40,476 --> 00:57:42,976
(Street entrance, 5 seconds later)

1504
00:57:43,909 --> 00:57:47,342
(Ayoung and Sojin are out of it)

1505
00:57:47,342 --> 00:57:48,509
(Ayoung and Sojin are out of it)

1506
00:57:48,509 --> 00:57:51,709
- It hurt a bit. / - I got pushed around by the pressure.

1507
00:57:51,709 --> 00:57:52,709
It was so strong.

1508
00:57:52,709 --> 00:57:55,409
This reminds me of the cold waterfall in public baths.

1509
00:57:55,409 --> 00:57:56,842
The water spurts out.

1510
00:57:56,842 --> 00:57:59,776
- You have that in women's baths too? / - It feels good.

1511
00:58:00,409 --> 00:58:02,609
- I thought it was only in men's baths. / - We have it too.

1512
00:58:04,909 --> 00:58:11,342
(This is just the start)

1513
00:58:14,042 --> 00:58:15,442
I caught the water from the back

1514
00:58:15,442 --> 00:58:16,942
and splashed it to the front.

1515
00:58:19,176 --> 00:58:21,842
That's rash. You'll get soaked even more.

1516
00:58:23,809 --> 00:58:26,509
- It's a true festival. / - It is.

1517
00:58:26,509 --> 00:58:28,409
- They're dancing. / - It's like the World Cup.

1518
00:58:28,409 --> 00:58:31,042
- You're right about that. / - Right?

1519
00:58:31,042 --> 00:58:32,876
So much passion there.

1520
00:58:32,876 --> 00:58:36,509
(Thingyan brings everyone together)

1521
00:58:38,542 --> 00:58:40,709
I see a rainbow!

1522
00:58:40,709 --> 00:58:43,609
- Right, we saw a rainbow. / - There was a rainbow.

1523
00:58:46,209 --> 00:58:50,009
(The heat and cold water created the rainbow)

1524
00:58:50,009 --> 00:58:54,109
It'd make you feel like you'll have good fortune.

1525
00:58:54,109 --> 00:58:56,209
- After all that blessing. / - You're right.

1526
00:58:56,209 --> 00:58:58,276
We were soaked in blessings.

1527
00:58:59,709 --> 00:59:04,109
(The rainbow moves with you)

1528
00:59:04,109 --> 00:59:07,076
I felt a sense of relief after being soaked.

1529
00:59:07,742 --> 00:59:09,542
- Right. You do feel that. / - Right?

1530
00:59:09,542 --> 00:59:11,809
It felt like a deep cleanse.

1531
00:59:11,809 --> 00:59:16,376
(They reach the end of the main street)

1532
00:59:17,976 --> 00:59:20,676
(Ayoung is now relaxed)

1533
00:59:20,676 --> 00:59:23,709
We made it out alive.

1534
00:59:23,709 --> 00:59:26,276
- You've passed that part. / - We almost died.

1535
00:59:27,109 --> 00:59:29,176
Playing with water tires you out the most, right?

1536
00:59:29,176 --> 00:59:30,076
Right, it exhausts you.

1537
00:59:30,076 --> 00:59:31,876
- You play a little and you're exhausted. / - It's strange.

1538
00:59:31,876 --> 00:59:33,642
It's really tiring.

1539
00:59:34,042 --> 00:59:35,976
(Rest areas near Sule Pagoda and the main street)

1540
00:59:35,976 --> 00:59:38,776
(They set up tents in the park)

1541
00:59:38,776 --> 00:59:40,509
We got soaked there, right?

1542
00:59:40,509 --> 00:59:42,476
- It must be hot. / - We got completely soaked.

1543
00:59:42,476 --> 00:59:44,176
- They're in the shade. / - Let's go and get them back.

1544
00:59:44,176 --> 00:59:45,676
They couldn't use their water guns even once.

1545
00:59:45,676 --> 00:59:48,142
- The water guns didn't work. / - They hit us hard.

1546
00:59:48,142 --> 00:59:50,309
- We were so prepared but... / - To be honest...

1547
00:59:50,309 --> 00:59:52,742
- We prepared this. / - Is your top dry already?

1548
00:59:53,409 --> 00:59:55,142
You dry up really fast.

1549
00:59:55,142 --> 00:59:57,542
We're pouring water on each other

1550
00:59:57,542 --> 00:59:59,242
to wash off the misfortune.

1551
00:59:59,242 --> 01:00:04,109
Let's see who washes off more misfortune.

1552
01:00:04,109 --> 01:00:06,509
Let's make it a game.

1553
01:00:06,509 --> 01:00:09,209
- Go and fight. / - Seeing who gets soaked more?

1554
01:00:09,209 --> 01:00:14,309
Let's wring our clothes and fill the water bottles here.

1555
01:00:14,309 --> 01:00:17,276
Are you going to take this again?

1556
01:00:17,276 --> 01:00:19,576
I don't have any other weapon.

1557
01:00:19,576 --> 01:00:20,842
This is all I have.

1558
01:00:20,842 --> 01:00:22,676
I'll give this to you then.

1559
01:00:24,009 --> 01:00:25,976
This? Don't you need this?

1560
01:00:25,976 --> 01:00:28,342
This is actually more useful than you think.

1561
01:00:28,342 --> 01:00:30,176
This is better than that.

1562
01:00:30,176 --> 01:00:32,076
- So I'll give it to you. / - Really?

1563
01:00:32,576 --> 01:00:34,842
- I'll see you after 30 minutes. / - Alright.

1564
01:00:34,842 --> 01:00:35,742
It's a competition.

1565
01:00:35,742 --> 01:00:37,976
Let's have a good fight.

1566
01:00:37,976 --> 01:00:40,742
Let's come back alive.

1567
01:00:40,742 --> 01:00:43,809
You're going separately?

1568
01:00:43,809 --> 01:00:45,909
I was actually a bit scared.

1569
01:00:45,909 --> 01:00:48,376
You should walk around together.

1570
01:00:48,376 --> 01:00:50,742
(Game start!)

1571
01:00:51,376 --> 01:00:53,842
(She keeps getting splashed with the water)

1572
01:00:53,842 --> 01:00:55,676
(She's the most popular one here)

1573
01:00:55,676 --> 01:00:57,076
Did you go there for a bath?

1574
01:00:58,409 --> 01:01:00,542
I was so surprised.

1575
01:01:01,676 --> 01:01:03,942
- I couldn't open my eyes. / - See you in 30 minutes.

1576
01:01:03,942 --> 01:01:07,776
Sojin is basically having a shower.

1577
01:01:07,776 --> 01:01:09,942
He just poured a whole bottle on her.

1578
01:01:09,942 --> 01:01:12,542
Later I ended up giving them my shoulders.

1579
01:01:12,542 --> 01:01:15,509
(Someone is running over)

1580
01:01:16,909 --> 01:01:20,309
(Ayoung runs over after being soaked)

1581
01:01:20,309 --> 01:01:21,676
Wait a minute.

1582
01:01:21,676 --> 01:01:22,709
There's nothing.

1583
01:01:22,709 --> 01:01:24,509
You came very early.

1584
01:01:25,409 --> 01:01:27,042
- I couldn't get any water. / - There's none.

1585
01:01:27,776 --> 01:01:28,909
What is she doing?

1586
01:01:30,309 --> 01:01:31,742
What is she doing?

1587
01:01:32,009 --> 01:01:34,242
(Her shoe turned into a secret water pouch)

1588
01:01:34,242 --> 01:01:36,742
Does the loser have to drink that?

1589
01:01:37,942 --> 01:01:39,242
You should wring out your socks.

1590
01:01:39,242 --> 01:01:40,676
The people nearby must've wondered

1591
01:01:40,676 --> 01:01:41,842
what on earth she's doing.

1592
01:01:41,842 --> 01:01:43,909
- Exactly. / - "What is she doing?"

1593
01:01:47,309 --> 01:01:51,476
(Sojin appears after more than 10 minutes)

1594
01:01:52,009 --> 01:01:54,076
(Smiling)

1595
01:01:54,076 --> 01:01:54,909
What is that?

1596
01:01:55,509 --> 01:01:58,342
(She pulls apart a dustpan)

1597
01:01:58,342 --> 01:01:59,976
She's clever.

1598
01:02:02,276 --> 01:02:03,909
- Unbelievable. / - Hey!

1599
01:02:04,776 --> 01:02:06,842
She didn't know.

1600
01:02:06,842 --> 01:02:09,476
I've never seen... No wonder.

1601
01:02:10,809 --> 01:02:13,076
(Pouring in)

1602
01:02:13,342 --> 01:02:14,442
That's a lot.

1603
01:02:14,442 --> 01:02:16,376
I just played with the kids.

1604
01:02:20,176 --> 01:02:23,476
- You did collect the water. / - Right.

1605
01:02:23,476 --> 01:02:25,509
He looks like he doesn't understand.

1606
01:02:25,509 --> 01:02:27,776
- "What's she doing?" / - Then he just pours it on himself.

1607
01:02:28,442 --> 01:02:30,176
So much water is coming out.

1608
01:02:30,776 --> 01:02:33,209
That's how you filled so much.

1609
01:02:34,442 --> 01:02:35,642
- Did you eat something? / - That looks good.

1610
01:02:35,642 --> 01:02:38,376
- What's she eating? / - Did you eat something?

1611
01:02:39,109 --> 01:02:41,242
They both feel betrayed by each other.

1612
01:02:41,242 --> 01:02:43,542
It looks like they traveled separately.

1613
01:02:43,542 --> 01:02:45,376
(Day before the festival)

1614
01:02:45,909 --> 01:02:48,376
- Was that for free? / - It was.

1615
01:02:48,376 --> 01:02:50,742
They give out free food.

1616
01:02:51,476 --> 01:02:54,909
If you go near Sule Pagoda,

1617
01:02:54,909 --> 01:02:57,009
you can eat for free.

1618
01:02:57,009 --> 01:02:59,309
- You can eat for free? / - That's so good.

1619
01:03:00,142 --> 01:03:02,176
- Sikyung, get ready. / - Yes, let's go.

1620
01:03:02,176 --> 01:03:03,542
Let's go.

1621
01:03:03,542 --> 01:03:05,776
- That looks good. How was it? / - It was so good.

1622
01:03:05,776 --> 01:03:06,809
Was it pho?

1623
01:03:06,809 --> 01:03:08,476
I don't know. But it was good.

1624
01:03:08,476 --> 01:03:09,276
- You just ate it. / - Yes.

1625
01:03:09,276 --> 01:03:11,342
Doesn't it look like beef radish soup?

1626
01:03:11,342 --> 01:03:13,509
- Kind of... Right. / - Like chicken and ginseng soup?

1627
01:03:13,509 --> 01:03:15,109
It's sort of like soup rice as well.

1628
01:03:15,109 --> 01:03:17,376
It looks like a clear blood sausage soup.

1629
01:03:18,009 --> 01:03:20,076
All of that food is for free?

1630
01:03:20,076 --> 01:03:20,876
What am I doing there?

1631
01:03:20,876 --> 01:03:23,709
You look happier alone. What happened?

1632
01:03:23,709 --> 01:03:26,276
(This is a festival!)

1633
01:03:26,276 --> 01:03:28,309
Look at that man looking at her.

1634
01:03:28,976 --> 01:03:30,976
Has it been 30 minutes yet?

1635
01:03:32,276 --> 01:03:34,009
Happy New Year!

1636
01:03:34,009 --> 01:03:37,742
(Ayoung, have you forgotten about the game?)

1637
01:03:38,976 --> 01:03:41,276
- I got you! / - You scared me.

1638
01:03:42,142 --> 01:03:44,342
That's what you kept doing.

1639
01:03:44,342 --> 01:03:46,442
What are you doing?

1640
01:03:47,942 --> 01:03:50,009
Is this allowed.

1641
01:03:50,609 --> 01:03:52,242
The dustpan is like my body.

1642
01:03:52,242 --> 01:03:54,376
You keep using your shoes.

1643
01:03:56,709 --> 01:04:00,109
(My shoes are the best!)

1644
01:04:01,142 --> 01:04:03,542
Isn't that too dirty?

1645
01:04:05,076 --> 01:04:07,276
The water should be clear.

1646
01:04:09,376 --> 01:04:11,809
Tell me the truth. How much did you pour?

1647
01:04:11,809 --> 01:04:14,109
You caught me just as I was doing it.

1648
01:04:14,109 --> 01:04:15,942
- I don't think so. / - I mean it.

1649
01:04:15,942 --> 01:04:18,242
- I doubt it. / - This is all from my hair.

1650
01:04:18,242 --> 01:04:19,776
She just got clean water.

1651
01:04:19,776 --> 01:04:20,942
- You can drink that. / - You can drink it.

1652
01:04:20,942 --> 01:04:23,909
Sojin's water isn't that clean either.

1653
01:04:23,909 --> 01:04:25,009
It's over.

1654
01:04:25,642 --> 01:04:27,776
Let me finish this.

1655
01:04:27,776 --> 01:04:29,342
You can't beat Sojin.

1656
01:04:29,342 --> 01:04:31,909
Ayoung's water is murky.

1657
01:04:31,909 --> 01:04:34,609
We went past the main street and

1658
01:04:34,609 --> 01:04:36,309
got splashed with the water.

1659
01:04:36,309 --> 01:04:38,742
We had a water fight with people here.

1660
01:04:38,742 --> 01:04:41,176
We did everything we could at Thingyan.

1661
01:04:41,176 --> 01:04:44,209
It's the day of water. Look. I'm still wet.

1662
01:04:44,209 --> 01:04:45,309
Water is still dripping.

1663
01:04:45,309 --> 01:04:47,642
They do this for a whole week, right?

1664
01:04:47,642 --> 01:04:50,276
- Yes, for around 4 days. / - All week?

1665
01:04:50,276 --> 01:04:52,042
That's a week-long festival?

1666
01:04:52,042 --> 01:04:53,342
I love this because it's about

1667
01:04:53,342 --> 01:04:54,942
chasing away bad luck.

1668
01:04:54,942 --> 01:04:56,842
You wash everything away

1669
01:04:56,842 --> 01:05:00,076
and start your New Year fresh.

1670
01:05:00,076 --> 01:05:01,809
I think things will go well for me.

1671
01:05:01,809 --> 01:05:05,042
- Yes, that's right. I have a good feeling. / - Yeah.

1672
01:05:05,042 --> 01:05:07,876
I'm hungry though. I screamed too much.

1673
01:05:07,876 --> 01:05:10,309
- Me too. / - I ran around too much.

1674
01:05:14,076 --> 01:05:15,909
It's on such a big scale.

1675
01:05:15,909 --> 01:05:18,709
- I want to go next year. / - Yes.

1676
01:05:18,709 --> 01:05:21,942
(They experience Thingyan in a magical country)

1677
01:05:22,042 --> 01:05:23,542
(Thingyan Festival)

1678
01:05:23,542 --> 01:05:27,009
(Beer Street)

1679
01:05:27,409 --> 01:05:30,076
The 19th street China Town.

1680
01:05:30,076 --> 01:05:32,976
- It looks great. / - Yes.

1681
01:05:32,976 --> 01:05:34,976
Everything will taste good there.

1682
01:05:34,976 --> 01:05:36,776
- Starting with the name. / - It's China Town.

1683
01:05:37,642 --> 01:05:40,442
- I can feel it. / - That's amazing.

1684
01:05:40,442 --> 01:05:42,909
- I love this mood. / - I want to go there.

1685
01:05:44,342 --> 01:05:45,309
What a nice atmosphere.

1686
01:05:45,309 --> 01:05:47,609
It's a hot place in Myanmar.

1687
01:05:47,609 --> 01:05:49,676
- It's a place for young people? / - Yes.

1688
01:05:49,676 --> 01:05:50,909
It's hot.

1689
01:05:50,909 --> 01:05:54,042
I had fun but feel so tired today.

1690
01:05:54,042 --> 01:05:56,976
- I'm tired after taking a shower. / - Me too.

1691
01:05:56,976 --> 01:06:00,142
- Did you order the beer? / - I did earlier.

1692
01:06:00,142 --> 01:06:02,876
You can only drink Myanmar beer in Yangon.

1693
01:06:05,142 --> 01:06:07,876
It's called Myanmar Beer.

1694
01:06:07,876 --> 01:06:11,376
They only sell Myanmar Beer in Yangon.

1695
01:06:11,376 --> 01:06:13,542
Recently, they started selling it in other cities.

1696
01:06:13,542 --> 01:06:15,676
- Look at the price. / - It's 800 kyats.

1697
01:06:15,676 --> 01:06:18,342
- How much is that? / - It's 70 cents.

1698
01:06:18,342 --> 01:06:21,609
- 70 cents? / - It's cheap. Less than 80 cents.

1699
01:06:21,609 --> 01:06:23,609
- It's 70 cents for a beer! / - And the taste?

1700
01:06:23,609 --> 01:06:26,376
That's actually cheaper than water in Korea.

1701
01:06:29,709 --> 01:06:32,576
- It's refreshing. / - It's refreshing.

1702
01:06:34,376 --> 01:06:37,642
(This is it)

1703
01:06:38,109 --> 01:06:40,376
It's like soju with beer.

1704
01:06:42,542 --> 01:06:43,742
Really?

1705
01:06:43,742 --> 01:06:44,876
- Is it high in alcohol content? / - Is it strong?

1706
01:06:44,876 --> 01:06:45,909
It's not because it's strong.

1707
01:06:45,909 --> 01:06:47,576
It tastes like soju with beer.

1708
01:06:47,576 --> 01:06:50,442
- It has that taste. / - Because of the fizziness?

1709
01:06:50,442 --> 01:06:53,609
If a draft beer is less than 70 cents...

1710
01:06:53,609 --> 01:06:55,376
- 100 glasses is $80. / - Right.

1711
01:06:55,376 --> 01:06:59,509
A glass for every judge here and it's still only $80.

1712
01:07:01,976 --> 01:07:02,642
Thank you.

1713
01:07:02,642 --> 01:07:04,342
- What should we get? / - I want seafood.

1714
01:07:04,342 --> 01:07:05,742
- Shrimp. / - Yeah, shrimp.

1715
01:07:05,742 --> 01:07:07,542
Let's try the corn.

1716
01:07:08,709 --> 01:07:10,242
That looks so good.

1717
01:07:10,242 --> 01:07:11,342
That looks really delicious.

1718
01:07:11,342 --> 01:07:15,676
You pick the skewers and they grill them on the spot.

1719
01:07:15,676 --> 01:07:19,676
(Looks delicious)

1720
01:07:21,342 --> 01:07:29,142
(The grilled skewers are mouth-watering)

1721
01:07:33,842 --> 01:07:34,642
That's nice.

1722
01:07:34,642 --> 01:07:36,176
That's less than $10.

1723
01:07:36,176 --> 01:07:38,342
- 12,300 kyats. / - Look at the corn.

1724
01:07:38,342 --> 01:07:39,309
It's huge.

1725
01:07:39,309 --> 01:07:40,809
How can a shrimp be so big?

1726
01:07:40,809 --> 01:07:43,542
All their shrimp are huge there.

1727
01:07:44,676 --> 01:07:46,509
This is the best complement to beer.

1728
01:07:47,342 --> 01:07:48,809
It's huge.

1729
01:07:48,809 --> 01:07:51,476
That would taste really great after playing in the water.

1730
01:07:51,476 --> 01:07:53,309
It would taste twice as good.

1731
01:07:54,609 --> 01:07:56,742
- That looks good. / - It was really good.

1732
01:07:56,742 --> 01:07:57,876
That looks really delicious.

1733
01:07:58,709 --> 01:08:00,142
Thank you.

1734
01:08:00,142 --> 01:08:03,076
- The corn? / - Should we try corn?

1735
01:08:04,676 --> 01:08:06,576
I wonder what the corn tastes like.

1736
01:08:06,576 --> 01:08:09,009
- They put it on a plate? / - Is it buttered?

1737
01:08:09,009 --> 01:08:10,776
- Is it with butter? / - Do they cut it for you?

1738
01:08:17,309 --> 01:08:19,642
They put butter and a little bit of cheese.

1739
01:08:19,642 --> 01:08:21,776
- Kind of like addictive corn? / - Yes.

1740
01:08:21,776 --> 01:08:23,709
- Addictive corn. / - Oh, that.

1741
01:08:23,709 --> 01:08:25,809
Beer snack! Beer snack!

1742
01:08:25,809 --> 01:08:28,242
You can't say anything bad about this.

1743
01:08:28,242 --> 01:08:30,409
- It's cheating. / - Even the smell...

1744
01:08:30,409 --> 01:08:33,342
- That looks so good. / - We'll have to eat that.

1745
01:08:33,342 --> 01:08:34,842
- After the show, right? / - Grilled corn.

1746
01:08:34,842 --> 01:08:36,709
- With a beer. / - In butter.

1747
01:08:37,476 --> 01:08:41,442
(Grilled corn is served on a plate)

1748
01:08:41,442 --> 01:08:42,842
Shall we try the corn?

1749
01:08:46,242 --> 01:08:47,676
It's fried with butter.

1750
01:08:49,976 --> 01:08:52,242
You have you eat that with a spoon.

1751
01:08:52,242 --> 01:08:53,742
With a spoon.

1752
01:08:55,342 --> 01:08:57,509
You'll have to order more of this.

1753
01:08:57,509 --> 01:09:00,242
When I was young, they'd serve that...

1754
01:09:00,242 --> 01:09:02,176
- At Japanese bars for free. / - Right.

1755
01:09:02,176 --> 01:09:03,876
I'd always ask for more of that.

1756
01:09:06,076 --> 01:09:07,809
That place is so charming.

1757
01:09:07,809 --> 01:09:10,309
I'd love to visit each shop and have a beer.

1758
01:09:10,309 --> 01:09:11,642
The atmosphere is great.

1759
01:09:11,642 --> 01:09:13,442
How far do you think we'll get?

1760
01:09:14,409 --> 01:09:21,576
(It's always sad to see a journey coming to an end)

1761
01:09:21,576 --> 01:09:23,509
If you come here around this time,

1762
01:09:23,509 --> 01:09:25,909
you can enjoy all this, so it'd be really nice.

1763
01:09:25,909 --> 01:09:28,409
The hot-air balloon tour was coming to an end

1764
01:09:28,409 --> 01:09:30,142
and the water festival was just starting.

1765
01:09:30,142 --> 01:09:33,976
You can enjoy everything right at this time.

1766
01:09:33,976 --> 01:09:35,376
If someone asks me what the Southeast Asian

1767
01:09:35,376 --> 01:09:36,409
country is the best...

1768
01:09:36,409 --> 01:09:39,309
- I'll tell them Myanmar. / - I'll recommend it as well.

1769
01:09:39,309 --> 01:09:42,242
The whole city was

1770
01:09:42,242 --> 01:09:44,476
enjoying the water festival.

1771
01:09:44,476 --> 01:09:47,709
The whole nation takes a break

1772
01:09:47,709 --> 01:09:50,109
for around 5 days and enjoys it together.

1773
01:09:50,109 --> 01:09:50,942
I think it's great.

1774
01:09:50,942 --> 01:09:52,376
- After this... / - And it's meaningful.

1775
01:09:52,376 --> 01:09:55,442
They start saving water for 2 weeks.

1776
01:09:55,442 --> 01:09:58,342
Even if you have to save water,

1777
01:09:58,342 --> 01:10:00,609
this is so important to them.

1778
01:10:00,609 --> 01:10:02,842
- They consider it important. / - They have no complaints.

1779
01:10:03,809 --> 01:10:06,176
I never knew Southeast Asia was so charming.

1780
01:10:06,176 --> 01:10:08,342
I haven't traveled much

1781
01:10:08,342 --> 01:10:10,376
but I never knew it was this much fun.

1782
01:10:10,376 --> 01:10:12,109
I was so surprised.

1783
01:10:12,109 --> 01:10:13,809
When you meet people,

1784
01:10:13,809 --> 01:10:16,876
there are some that aren't polite.

1785
01:10:16,876 --> 01:10:19,309
But everyone we met here was so polite.

1786
01:10:19,309 --> 01:10:21,509
They wanted to help us

1787
01:10:21,509 --> 01:10:23,076
and they always smiled.

1788
01:10:23,076 --> 01:10:26,609
We learned that "myan myan" means...

1789
01:10:26,609 --> 01:10:29,309
"Hurry up" in Burmese.

1790
01:10:30,109 --> 01:10:32,276
It feels strange.

1791
01:10:32,276 --> 01:10:34,209
In Korean, it means "sorry."

1792
01:10:34,209 --> 01:10:36,276
But here it means "hurry up."

1793
01:10:36,276 --> 01:10:40,076
I feel sorry for myself for always being in haste.

1794
01:10:41,476 --> 01:10:43,909
(We've been living in a fast-paced life with no answers)

1795
01:10:43,909 --> 01:10:46,909
I think Myanmar is so charming.

1796
01:10:46,909 --> 01:10:48,676
It was so charming.

1797
01:10:48,676 --> 01:10:50,609
- It's so pretty. / - I think it's romantic.

1798
01:10:50,609 --> 01:10:52,176
- Right. / - It's romantic.

1799
01:10:52,176 --> 01:10:54,509
I would cry if I went there too.

1800
01:10:54,509 --> 01:10:56,009
I'd get very emotional.

1801
01:10:56,009 --> 01:10:59,342
(They realize they're living busy lives)

1802
01:11:00,909 --> 01:11:03,909
In hindsight, it doesn't even matter.

1803
01:11:05,009 --> 01:11:08,209
I can newly discover myself and

1804
01:11:08,209 --> 01:11:10,342
pull my thoughts together when I'm on a trip.

1805
01:11:10,342 --> 01:11:13,609
And Myanmar was a perfect place to do that.

1806
01:11:16,476 --> 01:11:18,142
This is the last.

1807
01:11:18,142 --> 01:11:19,442
- Let's cheer for the Firefighting Tour. / - Okay.

1808
01:11:19,442 --> 01:11:20,709
I love the atmosphere there.

1809
01:11:20,709 --> 01:11:21,642
Ready, go.

1810
01:11:21,642 --> 01:11:24,476
Firefighting Tour, bboom bboom!

1811
01:11:26,876 --> 01:11:28,276
Nice.

1812
01:11:29,276 --> 01:11:32,776
(Firefighting Tour in Myanmar is over)

1813
01:11:35,109 --> 01:11:37,976
I was disappointed that all the shops were closed.

1814
01:11:37,976 --> 01:11:40,742
- But this street was... / - China Town.

1815
01:11:40,742 --> 01:11:41,676
It's a treasure.

1816
01:11:41,676 --> 01:11:43,009
Is there anything you should be

1817
01:11:43,009 --> 01:11:44,576
careful for at the festival?

1818
01:11:44,576 --> 01:11:47,409
There is. You can't remodel your water gun.

1819
01:11:47,409 --> 01:11:49,109
- It might be too dangerous. / - Right.

1820
01:11:49,109 --> 01:11:51,342
- You can't throw ice. / - You should never do that.

1821
01:11:51,342 --> 01:11:52,509
You can't throw any other powder

1822
01:11:52,509 --> 01:11:54,342
or solid besides water

1823
01:11:54,342 --> 01:11:55,609
since you could hurt someone.

1824
01:11:55,609 --> 01:11:58,642
You can't leave out alcohol on a trip and for festivals.

1825
01:11:58,642 --> 01:12:01,342
But to have a safe festival,

1826
01:12:01,342 --> 01:12:04,209
you can't drink during certain hours of the day.

1827
01:12:04,209 --> 01:12:06,576
You can't drink from midnight to 11 a.m.

1828
01:12:06,576 --> 01:12:07,676
That's the rule.

1829
01:12:07,676 --> 01:12:10,442
- From midnight to 11 a.m.? / - And from 2 to 5 p.m.

1830
01:12:10,442 --> 01:12:12,109
They have prohibition hours.

1831
01:12:12,109 --> 01:12:14,476
That's the time to have fun.

1832
01:12:14,476 --> 01:12:15,942
That's ridiculous.

1833
01:12:17,909 --> 01:12:21,209
I'm a grown man. I go on a trip with my own money.

1834
01:12:21,209 --> 01:12:23,209
But I'm not allowed to drink?

1835
01:12:23,709 --> 01:12:27,076
Both teams had good food and a lot of fun.

1836
01:12:27,076 --> 01:12:30,009
Let's check the cost which is the most important.

1837
01:12:30,009 --> 01:12:33,176
For the 6 days and 5 nights...

1838
01:12:33,176 --> 01:12:36,742
- It was 6 days? / - Yes, it was a long trip.

1839
01:12:36,742 --> 01:12:40,109
The amount we spent in Myanmar for 6 days...

1840
01:12:40,109 --> 01:12:41,142
The total is?

1841
01:12:41,142 --> 01:12:43,742
Excluding airfares.

1842
01:12:43,742 --> 01:12:45,242
- Per person. / - Per person.

1843
01:12:45,242 --> 01:12:48,842
We spent $985.30.

1844
01:12:49,642 --> 01:12:51,109
- Okay. / - Alright.

1845
01:12:51,109 --> 01:12:54,476
- Not bad, right? / - It was double the price of our trip.

1846
01:12:54,476 --> 01:12:55,442
- It was double. / - Yes.

1847
01:12:55,442 --> 01:12:56,942
And you need an entry visa, right?

1848
01:12:56,942 --> 01:12:59,576
You need an entry visa to go to Myanmar.

1849
01:12:59,576 --> 01:13:02,909
It costs $69 per person.

1850
01:13:02,909 --> 01:13:04,076
It's about $70.

1851
01:13:04,076 --> 01:13:07,376
80% of what we spent

1852
01:13:07,376 --> 01:13:09,609
was in Bagan.

1853
01:13:09,609 --> 01:13:13,609
- The domestic flight costs $250. / - That took up a lot.

1854
01:13:13,609 --> 01:13:17,709
- And the hot-air balloon is $360 per person. / - That was expensive.

1855
01:13:17,709 --> 01:13:20,609
- Then you spent $600 on that. / - Yes.

1856
01:13:20,609 --> 01:13:22,942
If you take that out, the trip doesn't cost anything.

1857
01:13:22,942 --> 01:13:24,776
But you can't take that out.

1858
01:13:25,542 --> 01:13:27,176
Thailand, Chiang Mai.

1859
01:13:27,176 --> 01:13:28,609
How much did the Tuhi Trip spend?

1860
01:13:28,609 --> 01:13:30,976
Excluding airfares. What was the total cost?

1861
01:13:30,976 --> 01:13:33,142
For 3 days and 2 nights,

1862
01:13:33,142 --> 01:13:35,442
the Tuhi Trip Tour spent a total of...

1863
01:13:35,442 --> 01:13:37,242
- A total of? / - Total of?

1864
01:13:37,242 --> 01:13:38,642
- Per person. / - Per person?

1865
01:13:38,642 --> 01:13:41,442
- It's 3 days and 2 nights. / - $219.

1866
01:13:42,409 --> 01:13:45,209
- That's just... / - That's so...

1867
01:13:45,209 --> 01:13:47,542
This is just so...

1868
01:13:48,676 --> 01:13:50,509
Great work. Great work.

1869
01:13:50,509 --> 01:13:52,442
- But they... / - We did it.

1870
01:13:52,442 --> 01:13:54,309
They slept at the airport.

1871
01:13:54,309 --> 01:13:56,276
- We slept at a hotel. / - It's 91 vs. 82.

1872
01:13:56,276 --> 01:13:57,676
- We're slightly in the lead. / - Right.

1873
01:13:57,676 --> 01:13:59,242
We'll add up the final scores

1874
01:13:59,242 --> 01:14:01,176
to decide the winner.

1875
01:14:01,176 --> 01:14:02,176
I'm so nervous.

1876
01:14:02,176 --> 01:14:04,076
- It was a good trip. / - We had a lot of fun.

1877
01:14:04,076 --> 01:14:05,176
This is the final vote.

1878
01:14:05,176 --> 01:14:07,342
Did you enjoy the Firefighting Tour and feel

1879
01:14:07,342 --> 01:14:08,909
you want to visit Myanmar...

1880
01:14:08,909 --> 01:14:11,476
Or will you visit Thailand and enjoy

1881
01:14:11,476 --> 01:14:14,709
the Songkran Festival just like the Tuhi Trip?

1882
01:14:14,709 --> 01:14:17,242
Please vote!

1883
01:14:18,209 --> 01:14:23,042
(What will the judges choose?)

1884
01:14:23,576 --> 01:14:28,342
Will it be the Firefighting Tour in Thingyan, Myanmar,

1885
01:14:28,342 --> 01:14:30,276
that let it all go and enjoyed the festival?

1886
01:14:30,276 --> 01:14:32,576
Will it be the Tuhi Trip in Songkran, Thailand,

1887
01:14:32,576 --> 01:14:36,742
the Mecca of those who love water festivals?

1888
01:14:36,742 --> 01:14:39,409
What did the judges choose?

1889
01:14:40,976 --> 01:14:42,476
Here we go.

1890
01:14:42,476 --> 01:14:44,409
This is a lighting system that you can only see on

1891
01:14:44,409 --> 01:14:45,509
"Immortal Songs" and Battle Trip.

1892
01:14:46,976 --> 01:14:48,009
Here we go.

1893
01:14:48,676 --> 01:14:50,142
We'll start with the first digit.

1894
01:14:51,076 --> 01:14:53,242
- Is it the last digit? / - We got over 100.

1895
01:14:53,242 --> 01:14:54,776
- The last digit? / - That's the way.

1896
01:14:56,109 --> 01:14:57,109
That's the way.

1897
01:14:58,442 --> 01:15:00,242
No!

1898
01:15:00,242 --> 01:15:01,276
What's going on?

1899
01:15:01,676 --> 01:15:02,809
What's going on?

1900
01:15:03,242 --> 01:15:04,109
No!

1901
01:15:04,109 --> 01:15:05,276
What's going on?

1902
01:15:09,642 --> 01:15:11,876
We won! We won!

1903
01:15:13,442 --> 01:15:16,309
You were the special host for 3 weeks, Suji.

1904
01:15:16,309 --> 01:15:17,842
How was it?

1905
01:15:17,842 --> 01:15:20,509
I got to learn about great trip locations

1906
01:15:20,509 --> 01:15:21,742
and received lots of good information.

1907
01:15:21,742 --> 01:15:24,042
I also know how to enjoy festivals now.

1908
01:15:24,042 --> 01:15:26,942
Now all I need to do is go off on a trip.

1909
01:15:26,942 --> 01:15:29,742
I'd like to greet you again from a trip location.

1910
01:15:29,742 --> 01:15:31,742
- Let me be a trip planner. / - I see.

1911
01:15:31,742 --> 01:15:34,009
- I really want to go. / - With who?

1912
01:15:34,542 --> 01:15:37,142
I'd like it to be a guy.

1913
01:15:38,242 --> 01:15:40,442
We can't do that unless you're married.

1914
01:15:40,442 --> 01:15:42,909
I'm sorry. I really want to go on a trip.

1915
01:15:42,909 --> 01:15:44,142
Okay.

1916
01:15:44,142 --> 01:15:46,476
We showed you local and

1917
01:15:46,476 --> 01:15:48,909
international festivals over the past 5 weeks.

1918
01:15:48,909 --> 01:15:51,842
We'll be back with a new special.

1919
01:15:51,842 --> 01:15:53,142
That's right.

1920
01:15:53,142 --> 01:15:56,409
We'll see you with a new special next week.

1921
01:15:56,409 --> 01:15:57,909
The world is your school. Life is a journey.

1922
01:15:57,909 --> 01:16:00,609
Battle Trip!

1924
01:16:05,409 --> 01:16:07,842
Oh, my. How nice.

1925
01:16:09,009 --> 01:16:10,842
- Isn't it so pretty? / - This is insane.

1927
01:16:15,842 --> 01:16:17,609
It's a 400-year-old island.

You can't help but take photos.

1929

It's different during the day and night.

1930

What is that?

1931
01:16:24,176 --> 01:16:26,242
I love Hangzhou.

1932
01:16:26,242 --> 01:16:28,176
The best to see in Kyoto.

1933
01:16:28,176 --> 01:16:29,909
- Okay, I'll look forward to it. / - No one knows about it.

1934
01:16:31,209 --> 01:16:32,542
This is so funny.

1935
01:16:33,176 --> 01:16:34,409
This is amazing.

1936
01:16:34,409 --> 01:16:36,142
It'll be an incredible trip.
