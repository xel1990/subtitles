1
00:00:00,443 --> 00:00:02,143
Xin chao, Hanoi!

2
00:00:03,910 --> 00:00:05,610
The Yeom Tour is no ordinary tour.

3
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:08,576
With Yeom Tour, there's just us.

4
00:00:08,576 --> 00:00:10,043
A place you must visit before you die

5
00:00:10,043 --> 00:00:11,843
but it's still not very well known.

6
00:00:11,843 --> 00:00:13,176
It's Ha Long Bay on land.

7
00:00:13,876 --> 00:00:15,010
Unbelievable!

8
00:00:15,010 --> 00:00:16,243
It was really good.

9
00:00:16,243 --> 00:00:17,943
It's Vietnamese style sausage stew.

10
00:00:19,543 --> 00:00:21,110
It's so good.

11
00:00:21,110 --> 00:00:22,543
It's just too good.

12
00:00:23,243 --> 00:00:25,610
(Which team will win?)

13
00:00:27,910 --> 00:00:30,810
(Numerous great tips on trips)

14
00:00:31,676 --> 00:00:32,676
(Choi Eunkyeong, Ahn Sunyeong)

15
00:00:33,476 --> 00:00:34,510
(Lee Jihye, Boom)

16
00:00:36,176 --> 00:00:37,376
Travel is war!

17
00:00:37,376 --> 00:00:39,743
Battle Trip!

18
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:43,443
Following on from last week...

19
00:00:43,443 --> 00:00:46,610
We're joined by our travelers who went on a tour

20
00:00:46,610 --> 00:00:48,143
planned by locals.

21
00:00:48,143 --> 00:00:50,476
We have our 100 impartial judges

22
00:00:50,476 --> 00:00:52,843
who will vote on today's trips.

23
00:00:52,843 --> 00:00:56,010
(100 judges in the audience)

24
00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:57,810
We had Eric Nam

25
00:00:57,810 --> 00:00:58,976
as our special host last week.

26
00:00:59,643 --> 00:01:01,543
He was almost lost for words.

27
00:01:01,543 --> 00:01:02,443
He kept saying he wanted to go.

28
00:01:02,443 --> 00:01:04,043
- Right. / - That's what he kept saying.

29
00:01:04,043 --> 00:01:05,810
I wanted to try all the dishes you were eating

30
00:01:05,810 --> 00:01:07,010
and visit there.

31
00:01:07,010 --> 00:01:09,076
I think I'll be visiting Hanoi very soon.

32
00:01:09,076 --> 00:01:10,676
- Yeom Tour. / - Yeom Tour.

33
00:01:10,676 --> 00:01:13,976
Eric, if you join us as a trip designer,

34
00:01:13,976 --> 00:01:15,676
where would you go? Except Hanoi.

35
00:01:15,676 --> 00:01:16,810
If I were a trip designer?

36
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:18,476
I'd go to a place I've never been.

37
00:01:18,476 --> 00:01:19,143
Where?

38
00:01:19,143 --> 00:01:20,510
I think somewhere in Africa would be fun.

39
00:01:21,843 --> 00:01:23,876
I think it'd be tough but fun.

40
00:01:23,876 --> 00:01:24,676
He's been to Africa.

41
00:01:24,676 --> 00:01:25,743
He has.

42
00:01:25,743 --> 00:01:27,543
- Where? / - I visited Ghana.

43
00:01:27,543 --> 00:01:28,576
Ghana?

44
00:01:28,576 --> 00:01:29,476
- With Sam. / - Sam Okyere.

45
00:01:29,476 --> 00:01:30,576
Yes, I visited Ghana.

46
00:01:30,576 --> 00:01:33,310
But the people there are all so energetic.

47
00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:35,743
- They're just exploding with energy. / - Right.

48
00:01:35,743 --> 00:01:37,410
Eric would feel dizzy there.

49
00:01:37,410 --> 00:01:38,243
They dance non-stop.

50
00:01:38,243 --> 00:01:39,643
- It's worse than here? / - They dance non-stop.

51
00:01:39,643 --> 00:01:41,410
They do greetings like this.

52
00:01:43,143 --> 00:01:44,276
Like this.

53
00:01:44,276 --> 00:01:45,710
I'm telling you.

54
00:01:45,710 --> 00:01:46,843
- I mean it. / - Too much exaggeration.

55
00:01:46,843 --> 00:01:48,043
- Are you serious? / - No way.

56
00:01:48,043 --> 00:01:50,610
Sam boasted about it.

57
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:52,043
They don't need to go clubbing.

58
00:01:52,043 --> 00:01:54,710
Wherever you go, they're laughing and dancing.

59
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:56,476
It's just an African thing.

60
00:01:56,476 --> 00:01:57,743
How do they greet you?

61
00:01:57,743 --> 00:01:58,943
Like this.

62
00:02:01,276 --> 00:02:02,910
They're the best. The most energetic.

63
00:02:02,910 --> 00:02:06,510
We're looking at tours that were planned by locals.

64
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:08,843
There are hidden local restaurants

65
00:02:08,843 --> 00:02:11,110
and hidden tourist attractions.

66
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:12,510
When I go on a trip,

67
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:14,676
I eat 7 meals a day.

68
00:02:14,676 --> 00:02:15,443
7?

69
00:02:15,443 --> 00:02:17,276
As soon as I get off at the Incheon Airport,

70
00:02:17,276 --> 00:02:19,243
I go to a good sashimi restaurant nearby.

71
00:02:19,243 --> 00:02:20,676
- Knife-cut noodles. / - I have that first.

72
00:02:20,676 --> 00:02:22,343
I cross the river to Paju

73
00:02:22,343 --> 00:02:23,510
for some good bean paste stew.

74
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:25,010
- That sounds good. / - I eat a meal there.

75
00:02:25,010 --> 00:02:26,843
Then I go to a cockle restaurant in Ilsan.

76
00:02:26,843 --> 00:02:29,243
Then go for some tea in Hongdae.

77
00:02:29,243 --> 00:02:30,776
Then Mapo for soy sauce marinated crab

78
00:02:30,776 --> 00:02:32,310
and fritters.

79
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:33,910
Then once you cross over Samgakji...

80
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:35,810
- They have that good codfish soup. / - Stop, stop.

81
00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:37,476
There's a lot to introduce to foreigners in Korea

82
00:02:37,476 --> 00:02:39,476
because they love our rice wine.

83
00:02:39,476 --> 00:02:41,976
And strangely, they really enjoy the fish market.

84
00:02:41,976 --> 00:02:42,976
It's fascinating.

85
00:02:42,976 --> 00:02:46,243
- That's true. / - They love small octopus.

86
00:02:46,243 --> 00:02:48,210
And they really like the fact you can eat fresh sashimi.

87
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:50,076
- They find that interesting. / - They do.

88
00:02:50,076 --> 00:02:51,510
Just as we announced,

89
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:52,743
today, it's a Filipino top star.

90
00:02:52,743 --> 00:02:55,143
A trip planned by Ryan Bang.

91
00:02:55,143 --> 00:02:57,043
We'll be heading off to Boracay in the Philippines.

92
00:02:57,043 --> 00:02:57,910
I can't wait.

93
00:02:57,910 --> 00:02:59,743
Boracay is such a famous tourist destination.

94
00:02:59,743 --> 00:03:01,076
It's a popular honeymoon spot.

95
00:03:01,076 --> 00:03:03,376
It's a popular destination worldwide.

96
00:03:03,376 --> 00:03:06,443
It's almost too popular in that it's been abused.

97
00:03:06,443 --> 00:03:08,343
I'm sure you've read the articles.

98
00:03:08,343 --> 00:03:09,876
They're planning to shut the island down

99
00:03:09,876 --> 00:03:11,676
temporarily for environmental cleanup.

100
00:03:12,376 --> 00:03:13,843
So if you're planning to go there,

101
00:03:13,843 --> 00:03:16,710
you need to check before you go.

102
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:18,876
When it comes to environmental issues,

103
00:03:18,876 --> 00:03:20,243
it's not just Boracay.

104
00:03:20,243 --> 00:03:22,743
- It's a global issue. / - It is.

105
00:03:22,743 --> 00:03:25,076
We'll have to be careful to keep

106
00:03:25,076 --> 00:03:27,076
the environment clean and come back.

107
00:03:27,076 --> 00:03:29,576
We'll start the Boracay trip.

108
00:03:29,576 --> 00:03:33,376
How satisfied were you with Ryan Bang?

109
00:03:33,376 --> 00:03:35,210
In Yeom Tour, Yeom Gyeonghwan was

110
00:03:35,210 --> 00:03:37,543
like the CEO of a travel agency.

111
00:03:37,543 --> 00:03:39,643
Ryan Bang is like the deputy section chief.

112
00:03:39,643 --> 00:03:41,043
He's like the head of the department.

113
00:03:41,043 --> 00:03:42,943
- Yes, he's full of energy. / - That's great.

114
00:03:42,943 --> 00:03:44,376
It will feel really different.

115
00:03:44,376 --> 00:03:46,710
- He'll try his best to show you more. / - Guide...

116
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:47,776
He doesn't rest.

117
00:03:47,776 --> 00:03:49,476
I have also been to Boracay.

118
00:03:49,476 --> 00:03:51,910
- A lot of people have been there. / - Really?

119
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:54,776
- Boracay is... / - People might be disappointed...

120
00:03:54,776 --> 00:03:56,776
- If you go on a basic tour. / - That's right.

121
00:03:56,776 --> 00:03:58,376
Is there anything special?

122
00:03:58,376 --> 00:03:59,443
It really isn't obvious.

123
00:03:59,443 --> 00:04:01,376
We've been to hidden attractions.

124
00:04:01,376 --> 00:04:02,076
It's amazing.

125
00:04:02,076 --> 00:04:04,076
- Even the name is charming. / - What is it?

126
00:04:04,076 --> 00:04:05,476
This is Blue Lagoon.

127
00:04:06,643 --> 00:04:08,310
It's called This is Blue Lagoon?

128
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:09,110
No.

129
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:12,010
It's Boracay's Blue Lagoon.

130
00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:14,276
- It's Blue Lagoon. / - You got it wrong.

131
00:04:14,276 --> 00:04:16,010
Boracay's Blue Lagoon.

132
00:04:16,010 --> 00:04:18,510
- This is Malumpati. / - That's right.

133
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:20,176
You'll like that place too.

134
00:04:20,176 --> 00:04:21,943
- It sounds like "party." / - Right.

135
00:04:21,943 --> 00:04:23,110
It's a party in itself.

136
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:24,410
It's the wrong spelling though.

137
00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:26,443
- The spelling's different. / - Yours is "pati."

138
00:04:26,443 --> 00:04:28,976
The spelling doesn't matter when we travel.

139
00:04:29,343 --> 00:04:30,876
You said that language was important.

140
00:04:30,876 --> 00:04:32,076
This is Malumpati.

141
00:04:32,076 --> 00:04:33,076
Pati, pati.

142
00:04:33,076 --> 00:04:34,310
Not "party," it's pati.

143
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:36,043
- I'm looking forward to it. / - I was surprised...

144
00:04:36,043 --> 00:04:38,443
After looking at the water.

145
00:04:38,443 --> 00:04:40,176
The water was so blue...

146
00:04:40,176 --> 00:04:42,076
It was like, this is emerald.

147
00:04:42,076 --> 00:04:43,376
This is emerald.

148
00:04:43,376 --> 00:04:45,043
- Emerald. / - They really were.

149
00:04:45,043 --> 00:04:46,710
- She got it from Boom. / - This is emerald.

150
00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:47,843
It was so beautiful.

151
00:04:47,843 --> 00:04:50,276
This is the harmful effect of Korea's English education.

152
00:04:50,276 --> 00:04:51,743
- What's wrong? / - Wait a minute.

153
00:04:51,743 --> 00:04:56,176
We experienced both the sky and sea of Boracay.

154
00:04:56,176 --> 00:04:59,743
Valuable attractions that you didn't know about

155
00:04:59,743 --> 00:05:01,810
will continue to come out.

156
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:05,076
Why would people keep talking about Boracay?

157
00:05:05,810 --> 00:05:08,010
It's 1 of the 3 best beaches in the world.

158
00:05:08,010 --> 00:05:09,876
- One of the best 3 in the world? / - Top 3.

159
00:05:09,876 --> 00:05:11,610
There are three 3 beaches in the world.

160
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:13,576
Gold Coast, Australia.

161
00:05:13,576 --> 00:05:14,576
- Yes, Gold Coast. / - And...

162
00:05:14,576 --> 00:05:16,376
- In Miami, U.S.A. / - Palm Beach.

163
00:05:16,376 --> 00:05:17,076
That's right.

164
00:05:17,076 --> 00:05:19,776
Then there's Boracay.

165
00:05:19,776 --> 00:05:20,810
- White Beach. / - White Beach in Boracay.

166
00:05:20,810 --> 00:05:21,643
That's right.

167
00:05:21,643 --> 00:05:24,210
The sunset is also amazing.

168
00:05:24,210 --> 00:05:26,510
It's so pretty.

169
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:28,010
Is it one of the best 3 sunsets in the world?

170
00:05:28,010 --> 00:05:28,843
It is.

171
00:05:28,843 --> 00:05:29,343
Actually, it isn't.

172
00:05:29,343 --> 00:05:30,010
It is.

173
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:30,776
Actually, it isn't.

174
00:05:30,776 --> 00:05:32,510
- It isn't? / - It's not one of the top 3 sunsets.

175
00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:33,476
We never discussed this beforehand.

176
00:05:33,476 --> 00:05:34,876
They're a bit strange.

177
00:05:34,876 --> 00:05:36,176
Where are the top 3 sunsets?

178
00:05:36,176 --> 00:05:36,743
Where?

179
00:05:36,743 --> 00:05:38,910
Kota Kinabalu in Malaysia,

180
00:05:38,910 --> 00:05:40,210
- And... / - It's really pretty there.

181
00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:41,876
- Santorini. / - Santorini in Greece,

182
00:05:41,876 --> 00:05:42,776
That's right, Santorini.

183
00:05:42,776 --> 00:05:43,643
And then...

184
00:05:43,643 --> 00:05:45,410
- Bali. / - Bali!

185
00:05:45,410 --> 00:05:46,910
- Boracay isn't one of them? / - It's Bali.

186
00:05:46,910 --> 00:05:47,743
Boracay isn't one of them?

187
00:05:47,743 --> 00:05:49,343
- Why are they talking about it then? / - No.

188
00:05:49,343 --> 00:05:52,443
- It's not even top 3. / - It might not be top 3...

189
00:05:52,443 --> 00:05:55,276
But the sunset is as beautiful as rare jewels.

190
00:05:55,276 --> 00:05:57,143
That's how we actually got the Korean term

191
00:05:57,143 --> 00:05:58,243
for "jewels."

192
00:06:01,776 --> 00:06:05,010
- From Boracay's sunset to jewels... / - Jewels...

193
00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:06,043
So the locals say,

194
00:06:06,043 --> 00:06:07,543
Hey, let's go watch the jewel.

195
00:06:07,543 --> 00:06:09,443
The locals there refer to the sunset in Korean?

196
00:06:09,443 --> 00:06:10,510
They know the word?

197
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:12,443
- Korean has been globalized... / - Excuse me.

198
00:06:12,443 --> 00:06:13,810
- So did you see the jewel? / - Anyway...

199
00:06:13,810 --> 00:06:14,743
- We did. / - To be honest...

200
00:06:14,743 --> 00:06:15,843
Yes, we saw it.

201
00:06:15,843 --> 00:06:17,410
The sunset we saw...

202
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:19,143
- Was the best in the world. / - You'll be shocked.

203
00:06:19,143 --> 00:06:20,976
It was that beautiful.

204
00:06:20,976 --> 00:06:23,243
Please pay attention to that.

205
00:06:24,443 --> 00:06:26,976
Let's start the Boracay trip.

206
00:06:26,976 --> 00:06:31,543
The food and trip itself was good in Hanoi...

207
00:06:31,543 --> 00:06:33,610
- But the costs... / - Great affordability.

208
00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:34,910
How about Boracay?

209
00:06:34,910 --> 00:06:37,910
Boracay is a city that makes money from tourism.

210
00:06:37,910 --> 00:06:39,610
So you can't compare with Hanoi.

211
00:06:39,610 --> 00:06:41,543
- It must be expensive. / - The cost is quite expensive.

212
00:06:41,543 --> 00:06:43,143
- It's a tourist spot. / - You need to spend at times.

213
00:06:43,143 --> 00:06:45,576
That's right. You're going there to spend money,

214
00:06:45,576 --> 00:06:47,376
why try to save?

215
00:06:47,376 --> 00:06:48,743
It's expensive compared to other Filipino islands?

216
00:06:48,743 --> 00:06:50,276
- We worked so hard to earn money. / - Of course.

217
00:06:50,276 --> 00:06:51,543
We're going to have an amazing tour.

218
00:06:51,543 --> 00:06:53,043
You need to spend to have fun.

219
00:06:53,043 --> 00:06:54,343
It's an expensive place.

220
00:06:54,343 --> 00:06:55,743
It's going to be hard for us today.

221
00:06:55,743 --> 00:06:57,143
It's expensive.

222
00:06:57,143 --> 00:06:58,710
- How's the exchange rate? / - It's a little too much.

223
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:00,610
The exchange rate changes every day.

224
00:07:00,610 --> 00:07:01,743
The exchange rate changes every day.

225
00:07:02,976 --> 00:07:04,676
- What? / - Yes, it changes every day.

226
00:07:04,676 --> 00:07:05,410
- That's right. / - Is it?

227
00:07:05,410 --> 00:07:06,443
It changes by the hour.

228
00:07:06,443 --> 00:07:08,043
Is there no standard?

229
00:07:08,043 --> 00:07:09,443
To set a standard...

230
00:07:09,443 --> 00:07:12,543
Take the Filipino peso and calculate to Korean won...

231
00:07:12,543 --> 00:07:13,643
This is the easiest way.

232
00:07:13,643 --> 00:07:16,343
Just multiply the given price by 20.

233
00:07:16,343 --> 00:07:17,910
Then you will get the Korean price.

234
00:07:17,910 --> 00:07:19,276
Hanoi took a zero out.

235
00:07:19,276 --> 00:07:20,543
- They removed a zero. / - Multiply by 20.

236
00:07:20,543 --> 00:07:21,476
- It's the complete opposite. / - Yes.

237
00:07:21,476 --> 00:07:23,610
For example, if it's 1,500 peso,

238
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:24,510
multiply by 20.

239
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:25,610
- It's $30. / - It's $30.

240
00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:26,743
You get $30.

241
00:07:26,743 --> 00:07:28,443
That's how you calculate it.

242
00:07:28,443 --> 00:07:30,943
- I see. / - Anyway, when it comes to Boracay...

243
00:07:30,943 --> 00:07:32,543
It is so beautiful.

244
00:07:32,543 --> 00:07:34,876
I have a quiz for you now.

245
00:07:34,876 --> 00:07:36,410
- Try to get it right. / - Quiz?

246
00:07:36,410 --> 00:07:39,510
In Boracay, there are 5 "S."

247
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:40,543
5 "S."

248
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:42,610
"S." Guess what they are.

249
00:07:42,610 --> 00:07:44,543
- Picturesque 5 "S." / - Sky.

250
00:07:44,543 --> 00:07:45,443
Sea.

251
00:07:45,443 --> 00:07:46,543
Sky?

252
00:07:46,543 --> 00:07:48,610
Correct. Sea, correct.

253
00:07:48,610 --> 00:07:50,576
- Sky is correct. / - Steak, sausage...

254
00:07:50,576 --> 00:07:51,676
- Smoothie. / - Wrong.

255
00:07:52,510 --> 00:07:54,076
What?

256
00:07:54,076 --> 00:07:55,410
- It's not food. / - Food is important.

257
00:07:55,410 --> 00:07:56,776
- It's important. / - Excuse me.

258
00:07:56,776 --> 00:07:58,310
Don't you know how important steak is?

259
00:07:58,310 --> 00:07:59,176
- What could it be? / - Sand.

260
00:07:59,176 --> 00:08:00,443
- Sand? / - Sand?

261
00:08:00,443 --> 00:08:01,443
Sun.

262
00:08:01,443 --> 00:08:02,210
Sun?

263
00:08:02,210 --> 00:08:03,176
- Sun... / - Sun...

264
00:08:03,176 --> 00:08:04,076
Stamina?

265
00:08:04,076 --> 00:08:05,243
Sunset, sunset.

266
00:08:05,243 --> 00:08:06,443
- Sikyung? / - Sunset.

267
00:08:06,443 --> 00:08:07,876
- Sunset. / - Sunset.

268
00:08:07,876 --> 00:08:08,643
Correct.

269
00:08:08,643 --> 00:08:09,276
Do we have all the answers?

270
00:08:09,276 --> 00:08:10,576
I'll give you a hint.

271
00:08:10,576 --> 00:08:11,410
Beer.

272
00:08:11,410 --> 00:08:13,410
- Oh, San Miguel! / - Correct!

273
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:14,976
- San Miguel. / - Beer?

274
00:08:14,976 --> 00:08:16,743
There's one left.

275
00:08:16,743 --> 00:08:17,643
You didn't mention star.

276
00:08:17,643 --> 00:08:19,276
- Stars? / - Yes.

277
00:08:19,276 --> 00:08:20,910
It'd be great to do all of that at once.

278
00:08:20,910 --> 00:08:22,343
- 5... / - Sitting under the stars in the sky...

279
00:08:22,343 --> 00:08:24,210
Drinking beer.

280
00:08:24,210 --> 00:08:25,843
- We did that! / - With the sunset...

281
00:08:25,843 --> 00:08:26,710
We did it.

282
00:08:26,710 --> 00:08:28,010
- I just got goose bumps. / - We did it.

283
00:08:28,010 --> 00:08:30,810
- Do you want to enjoy 5 "S?" / - Yes!

284
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:32,410
Just wait a little bit more.

285
00:08:33,876 --> 00:08:34,910
Okay.

286
00:08:35,810 --> 00:08:38,843
We really hope that we get to see those 5 "S."

287
00:08:38,843 --> 00:08:41,310
We head off on the RaBang Tour to Boracay!

288
00:08:41,310 --> 00:08:42,476
Let's go.

289
00:08:43,810 --> 00:08:44,943
It's Boom.

290
00:08:44,943 --> 00:08:46,143
Hello. Nice to meet you.

291
00:08:46,143 --> 00:08:48,043
Did you get your husband's permission?

292
00:08:48,043 --> 00:08:49,510
I didn't get his permission yet.

293
00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:50,443
I'll tell him once I come back.

294
00:08:50,443 --> 00:08:51,476
You can't do that.

295
00:08:51,476 --> 00:08:53,476
- I'll tell him later. / - I'll be in an awkward position.

296
00:08:53,476 --> 00:08:55,743
It's okay. Business is just business.

297
00:08:55,743 --> 00:08:56,243
Really?

298
00:08:56,243 --> 00:08:57,976
How is your traveling style?

299
00:08:57,976 --> 00:09:00,110
I'd describe my traveling style as...

300
00:09:00,110 --> 00:09:01,643
Day fire, night fire, dawn fire.

301
00:09:01,643 --> 00:09:02,310
What is that?

302
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:04,810
I'm on fire during the day, night and dawn.

303
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:05,943
When do you rest then?

304
00:09:05,943 --> 00:09:07,610
- You could get tired... / - When do you rest?

305
00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:10,876
I don't get enjoyment by abusing my body.

306
00:09:10,876 --> 00:09:12,943
Then what about something dynamic?

307
00:09:12,943 --> 00:09:14,543
- Do you like leisure sports? / - No, no, no.

308
00:09:14,543 --> 00:09:17,043
I like to eat, rest,

309
00:09:17,043 --> 00:09:18,110
then eat some more.

310
00:09:18,110 --> 00:09:19,910
Then have a little drink.

311
00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:20,910
She's like my mom.

312
00:09:22,443 --> 00:09:23,710
- Excuse me. / - That's travel for the elderly.

313
00:09:23,710 --> 00:09:24,576
That's how my mom travels.

314
00:09:24,576 --> 00:09:26,510
You should take rests while doing anything.

315
00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:27,643
That's like a senior's travel package.

316
00:09:27,643 --> 00:09:29,776
No, no. But I like that.

317
00:09:29,776 --> 00:09:31,910
But I have a lot of energy

318
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:33,343
so I can keep up.

319
00:09:33,343 --> 00:09:35,376
I always take a Bluetooth operated mic with me.

320
00:09:35,376 --> 00:09:36,910
I always sing when I'm excited.

321
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:38,810
I attach a mic here like a musical actor.

322
00:09:38,810 --> 00:09:40,743
Right here.

323
00:09:40,743 --> 00:09:41,843
- Really? / - Yes.

324
00:09:41,843 --> 00:09:43,410
- It's Bluetooth operated. / - You mean it.

325
00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:45,410
- Make sure you do it for me. / - Okay, okay.

326
00:09:45,410 --> 00:09:49,076
A local who lives in that country...

327
00:09:49,076 --> 00:09:50,010
A local?

328
00:09:50,010 --> 00:09:52,143
Will plan your trip.

329
00:09:52,143 --> 00:09:54,176
That's the special you will take part in.

330
00:09:54,176 --> 00:09:56,110
The Philippines in Southeast Asia.

331
00:09:56,110 --> 00:09:57,210
- The Philippines? / - Yes.

332
00:09:57,210 --> 00:10:00,243
Who lives in the Philippines?

333
00:10:00,243 --> 00:10:02,676
If it's the Philippines, isn't it Sandara Park?

334
00:10:02,676 --> 00:10:04,376
You don't pronounce her name like that.

335
00:10:04,376 --> 00:10:05,943
It's Sandara.

336
00:10:05,943 --> 00:10:07,143
That doesn't sound right.

337
00:10:07,143 --> 00:10:07,843
No, I mean it.

338
00:10:07,843 --> 00:10:09,443
- Are you sure? / - Sandara.

339
00:10:09,443 --> 00:10:11,076
- It's Sandara. / - I think how I said it was correct.

340
00:10:11,076 --> 00:10:14,410
He's the Yu Jaeseok of the Philippines.

341
00:10:15,210 --> 00:10:16,843
Yu Jaeseok of the Philippines.

342
00:10:16,843 --> 00:10:18,610
He hosts shows.

343
00:10:18,610 --> 00:10:20,443
- Really? / - He's so good at Tagalog.

344
00:10:20,443 --> 00:10:23,943
- He's like the local Yu Jaeseok. / - He's Korean?

345
00:10:23,943 --> 00:10:25,576
Yes, he's Korean.

346
00:10:25,576 --> 00:10:26,643
He's funny.

347
00:10:26,643 --> 00:10:28,176
He's my junior.

348
00:10:28,176 --> 00:10:29,443
No, you're a singer.

349
00:10:29,443 --> 00:10:31,710
No, I'm a TV personality.

350
00:10:31,710 --> 00:10:33,643
- Ida Daussy is my senior. / - Right.

351
00:10:33,643 --> 00:10:34,943
We are TV personalities.

352
00:10:34,943 --> 00:10:36,310
- Robert Holley is also my senior. / - Robert Holley.

353
00:10:37,043 --> 00:10:37,776
- That's funny. / - So...

354
00:10:37,776 --> 00:10:39,443
- He's my junior. / - You're so funny.

355
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:41,943
Hello.

356
00:10:41,943 --> 00:10:44,810
I've been working in the Philippines since 2010

357
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:46,343
to the present.

358
00:10:46,343 --> 00:10:47,743
My name is Ryan Bang.

359
00:10:47,743 --> 00:10:50,776
I came to the Philippines when I was in 7th grade

360
00:10:50,776 --> 00:10:52,476
due to my parents.

361
00:10:52,476 --> 00:10:55,510
I came here as an overseas student.

362
00:10:55,510 --> 00:10:58,410
Then in 2010,

363
00:10:58,410 --> 00:11:01,510
I starred in "Pinoy Big Brother," the audition program,

364
00:11:01,510 --> 00:11:03,176
and came 2nd.

365
00:11:03,176 --> 00:11:05,543
I started working in television since then.

366
00:11:05,543 --> 00:11:07,510
That's right. He came 2nd in an audition program.

367
00:11:08,476 --> 00:11:09,943
- Here we go. / - He's extremely popular.

368
00:11:09,943 --> 00:11:12,976
- He's unbelievably popular. / - Which one is he?

369
00:11:12,976 --> 00:11:14,176
- On the far left. / - Really?

370
00:11:14,176 --> 00:11:16,010
He's loved by the middle aged women

371
00:11:16,010 --> 00:11:18,043
in the Philippines like a son.

372
00:11:19,210 --> 00:11:22,743
- The national son of the Philippines is here. / - Hey!

373
00:11:24,176 --> 00:11:26,376
That's right. He was on the Dara Tour.

374
00:11:26,376 --> 00:11:28,276
- He's a celebrity. / - Hello.

375
00:11:28,276 --> 00:11:30,443
- He really is a national celebrity. / - Hello.

376
00:11:30,443 --> 00:11:32,276
Yeah, Ryan Bang.

377
00:11:32,276 --> 00:11:34,243
Are you at a restaurant?

378
00:11:35,310 --> 00:11:37,310
- I'm on a drama set. / - Our first meeting.

379
00:11:37,310 --> 00:11:38,743
- A drama? / - Drama?

380
00:11:38,743 --> 00:11:39,810
Do you also act?

381
00:11:39,810 --> 00:11:41,476
I'm on a daily drama.

382
00:11:42,810 --> 00:11:43,910
He's so busy.

383
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:46,643
I've been to Boracay many times

384
00:11:46,643 --> 00:11:48,243
so I know it well.

385
00:11:48,243 --> 00:11:51,076
Boracay has the most beautiful sunset in the Philippines.

386
00:11:51,076 --> 00:11:52,276
The sunset.

387
00:11:52,276 --> 00:11:54,243
- It was amazing. / - I ask with caution.

388
00:11:54,243 --> 00:11:57,643
Is there a party we can enjoy during the sunset?

389
00:11:58,343 --> 00:12:00,876
Boracay is the most popular in the Philippines

390
00:12:00,876 --> 00:12:02,710
among Boracay, Cebu and Palawan.

391
00:12:02,710 --> 00:12:06,143
That's because there are clubs three steps away

392
00:12:06,143 --> 00:12:08,210
from the beach in Boracay.

393
00:12:09,943 --> 00:12:10,976
Here we go.

394
00:12:10,976 --> 00:12:13,043
When you walk on the beach, it's all clubs.

395
00:12:13,043 --> 00:12:15,310
- Really? / - Like outdoor clubs.

396
00:12:15,310 --> 00:12:17,010
By the way...

397
00:12:17,010 --> 00:12:18,310
Do you have a car?

398
00:12:18,310 --> 00:12:19,010
- Car? / - Car?

399
00:12:19,010 --> 00:12:21,310
Will you drive us around?

400
00:12:21,310 --> 00:12:24,976
Motorcycles in Boracay are

401
00:12:24,976 --> 00:12:26,543
convenient like taxis.

402
00:12:26,543 --> 00:12:28,043
Motorcycles are dangerous.

403
00:12:28,043 --> 00:12:29,943
Have you ever thought about buying a car?

404
00:12:31,076 --> 00:12:32,943
Boom wanted to travel conveniently.

405
00:12:32,943 --> 00:12:34,443
- Something like that. / - Like in a van.

406
00:12:35,543 --> 00:12:38,943
I still have a year left on the car I bought in Manila.

407
00:12:38,943 --> 00:12:40,010
I took out a loan for that.

408
00:12:40,010 --> 00:12:41,710
I can't buy another car in Boracay.

409
00:12:42,476 --> 00:12:43,476
Please visit.

410
00:12:43,476 --> 00:12:46,443
I'll relieve all of your stress in Boracay.

411
00:12:46,443 --> 00:12:47,310
He's so kind

412
00:12:47,310 --> 00:12:49,210
when he must be so busy, isn't he?

413
00:12:49,210 --> 00:12:51,243
I think it's going to be so fun.

414
00:12:51,243 --> 00:12:52,976
Let's meet soon.

415
00:12:52,976 --> 00:12:54,076
Yes, come here quickly.

416
00:12:54,076 --> 00:12:56,843
I'll wait for you in Boracay.

417
00:12:56,843 --> 00:12:58,476
- Bye. / - He's so trustworthy.

418
00:12:58,476 --> 00:12:59,610
He's trustworthy.

419
00:12:59,610 --> 00:13:01,510
He's very meticulous.

420
00:13:01,510 --> 00:13:03,876
It would be great if you had a friend like him there.

421
00:13:03,876 --> 00:13:05,310
- Of course. / - Boracay is good.

422
00:13:05,310 --> 00:13:06,443
Someone as enthusiastic as him.

423
00:13:08,543 --> 00:13:09,276
Look at the sea.

424
00:13:10,676 --> 00:13:11,810
It's so pretty.

425
00:13:11,810 --> 00:13:13,376
Look at the color. Look at the sky.

426
00:13:13,376 --> 00:13:18,043
(One of the top 3 beaches in the world)

427
00:13:19,810 --> 00:13:23,076
I'll use the knowledge and skills

428
00:13:23,076 --> 00:13:25,910
I have gathered from my trips to Boracay.

429
00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:28,510
Boracay is fairly well-known to Korean tourists.

430
00:13:28,510 --> 00:13:30,076
I've prepared a lot of unique activities

431
00:13:30,076 --> 00:13:33,010
that not many tourists know of.

432
00:13:33,010 --> 00:13:33,976
I can trust Ryan.

433
00:13:33,976 --> 00:13:36,410
Gyeonghwan's only lived in Vietnam for 2 years.

434
00:13:36,410 --> 00:13:38,476
- Ryan's been there for 13. / - No need for words.

435
00:13:38,476 --> 00:13:39,510
- The thing is... / - That's true.

436
00:13:39,510 --> 00:13:42,310
We know that it's at least 5 times better in person.

437
00:13:42,310 --> 00:13:44,543
- That's right. / - I've prepared...

438
00:13:44,543 --> 00:13:47,076
Places Koreans don't know of.

439
00:13:47,076 --> 00:13:47,876
I love that.

440
00:13:47,876 --> 00:13:49,243
I'll give you a tip.

441
00:13:49,243 --> 00:13:49,876
Tip?

442
00:13:49,876 --> 00:13:51,110
- How much? / - How much?

443
00:13:51,110 --> 00:13:52,043
Hey...

444
00:13:52,043 --> 00:13:53,710
Why do you keep saying my lines.

445
00:13:53,710 --> 00:13:55,443
We kept saying the same thing.

446
00:13:55,443 --> 00:13:58,343
Koreans come here and only spend time on the island.

447
00:13:58,343 --> 00:14:00,043
But we'll take a boat out.

448
00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:01,643
Outside of the island.

449
00:14:01,643 --> 00:14:02,776
We head out.

450
00:14:02,776 --> 00:14:03,976
Check it out!

451
00:14:03,976 --> 00:14:05,243
Isn't this amazing?

452
00:14:06,443 --> 00:14:07,776
This place is the best.

453
00:14:07,776 --> 00:14:09,476
It's the cleanest area.

454
00:14:09,476 --> 00:14:12,010
I'm certain I will never forget this trip.

455
00:14:12,010 --> 00:14:13,176
I'll remember the nature when

456
00:14:13,176 --> 00:14:14,676
I'm about to die.

457
00:14:14,676 --> 00:14:16,576
And the traditions we experienced.

458
00:14:16,576 --> 00:14:17,776
- What is that? / - Tradition.

459
00:14:17,776 --> 00:14:19,576
- Traditional meal. / - You eat with your hands.

460
00:14:19,576 --> 00:14:21,243
We could experience everything there was.

461
00:14:21,943 --> 00:14:23,076
That's what I loved about the trip.

462
00:14:24,743 --> 00:14:26,843
The trip begins the day before you depart.

463
00:14:29,643 --> 00:14:32,176
(Their destination is Kalibo International Airport)

464
00:14:32,176 --> 00:14:34,243
It's such a big city, you know.

465
00:14:34,976 --> 00:14:36,443
What do you want to do the most

466
00:14:36,443 --> 00:14:37,843
when you get to Boracay?

467
00:14:37,843 --> 00:14:38,976
I want to go clubbing.

468
00:14:38,976 --> 00:14:40,343
Clubbing?

469
00:14:40,343 --> 00:14:42,310
I quit going to clubs a long time ago.

470
00:14:42,310 --> 00:14:43,110
Is this Jihye's husband?

471
00:14:43,876 --> 00:14:45,876
Well, your wife just said that she wants to go...

472
00:14:45,876 --> 00:14:47,176
Geez.

473
00:14:48,010 --> 00:14:48,510
Don't do that.

474
00:14:48,510 --> 00:14:50,143
- You need his permission. / - No, no. He needs rest.

475
00:14:50,143 --> 00:14:51,176
My husband needs his rest.

476
00:14:51,176 --> 00:14:53,043
I'm sure he'll go clubbing too.

477
00:14:53,043 --> 00:14:54,610
- How could you say that? / - He must rest too.

478
00:14:54,610 --> 00:14:55,676
What's with that?

479
00:14:55,676 --> 00:14:57,510
Here are your meals. Please enjoy.

480
00:15:00,676 --> 00:15:02,176
I love the in-flight meals.

481
00:15:02,176 --> 00:15:03,810
- It was delicious. / - Aren't the meals delicious?

482
00:15:04,476 --> 00:15:06,410
I'm sure that next to the pilot

483
00:15:06,410 --> 00:15:07,643
is a row of crocks for the kimchi.

484
00:15:07,643 --> 00:15:08,843
Like a kimchi fridge.

485
00:15:08,843 --> 00:15:10,043
This kimchi is so good.

486
00:15:11,843 --> 00:15:12,710
(Korea)

487
00:15:12,710 --> 00:15:13,643
(Kalibo International Airport)

488
00:15:14,243 --> 00:15:15,210
(Kalibo International Airport)

489
00:15:15,210 --> 00:15:17,576
(Boracay island dock)

490
00:15:20,676 --> 00:15:22,343
The ocean there was breathtaking.

491
00:15:22,343 --> 00:15:25,143
If you spend 3 days just watching the ocean...

492
00:15:25,143 --> 00:15:26,443
What is that?

493
00:15:27,176 --> 00:15:28,243
- Just sand. / - I see.

494
00:15:31,276 --> 00:15:32,443
I love things like this.

495
00:15:33,176 --> 00:15:34,543
My gosh, look at that.

496
00:15:36,243 --> 00:15:36,943
This is great.

497
00:15:36,943 --> 00:15:37,710
Which song does it remind you of?

498
00:15:37,710 --> 00:15:39,743
What's the first song you thought of?

499
00:15:39,743 --> 00:15:42,476
♪ How can it be so good? ♪

500
00:15:42,476 --> 00:15:44,410
It's Jihye's song.

501
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:45,943
Jihye really loves herself.

502
00:15:45,943 --> 00:15:47,610
I have a bit of narcissism so

503
00:15:47,610 --> 00:15:49,243
I sing my songs often.

504
00:15:49,243 --> 00:15:52,476
♪ Under the burning sun ♪

505
00:15:53,043 --> 00:15:53,943
POSITION.

506
00:15:53,943 --> 00:15:55,043
That's right!

507
00:15:55,876 --> 00:15:56,743
Right.

508
00:15:56,743 --> 00:16:00,010
♪ Summer time ♪

509
00:16:00,776 --> 00:16:02,510
This is incredible. It's like a music video.

510
00:16:03,776 --> 00:16:06,010
Come to think of it, the old school songs

511
00:16:06,010 --> 00:16:08,810
all shot music videos in a place like that.

512
00:16:08,810 --> 00:16:10,710
- Starting with COOL... / - Right.

513
00:16:10,710 --> 00:16:13,076
- Doing this on the yacht. / - On the ocean...

514
00:16:13,076 --> 00:16:13,876
Bang, Bang.

00:16:13,876 --> 00:16:14,810
- RaBang? / - Yeah.

516
00:16:14,810 --> 00:16:15,776
Our Ryan Bang.

517
00:16:15,776 --> 00:16:17,476
We're supposed to meet him at the beach.

518
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:19,476
- How can we find him? It's big. / - We can't find him.

519
00:16:19,476 --> 00:16:20,910
- Ryan! / - Where are you, Ryan?

520
00:16:22,643 --> 00:16:23,576
Isn't that Ryan Bang?

521
00:16:24,543 --> 00:16:26,410
Where is he?

522
00:16:27,176 --> 00:16:28,976
We can... Hey, he's right there!

523
00:16:28,976 --> 00:16:29,776
Where? Where?

524
00:16:31,476 --> 00:16:32,343
Ryan.

525
00:16:33,043 --> 00:16:34,743
Is that you, Ryan?

526
00:16:34,743 --> 00:16:36,976
- Ryan Bang? / - Don't act like you didn't see me.

527
00:16:36,976 --> 00:16:38,510
- Ryan. / - Hello.

528
00:16:41,043 --> 00:16:43,310
Welcome to the Philippines.

529
00:16:43,310 --> 00:16:45,610
When did you get here?

530
00:16:45,610 --> 00:16:47,910
When I don't have work, I come to Boracay very often.

531
00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:51,743
From Manila, Boracay is the closest island

532
00:16:51,743 --> 00:16:53,410
that has beautiful beaches.

533
00:16:53,410 --> 00:16:55,310
It only takes me about 30 or 40 minutes.

534
00:16:55,310 --> 00:16:57,910
We are at Angol Beach now.

535
00:16:57,910 --> 00:16:59,810
- Angol Beach? / - Angol Beach.

536
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:00,676
Angol Beach.

537
00:17:00,676 --> 00:17:02,876
I wanted to meet you here

538
00:17:02,876 --> 00:17:05,143
because Korean tourists don't know about it.

539
00:17:05,143 --> 00:17:06,976
Only the locals know about it.

540
00:17:06,976 --> 00:17:09,943
Yes, locals and Westerners come here.

541
00:17:09,943 --> 00:17:12,143
Because in the past, Boracay

542
00:17:12,143 --> 00:17:14,443
didn't have Stations 1 and 2.

543
00:17:14,443 --> 00:17:15,776
20 to 30 years ago,

544
00:17:15,776 --> 00:17:18,610
there was only Station 3 at Angol Beach.

545
00:17:18,610 --> 00:17:19,643
30 years ago.

546
00:17:19,643 --> 00:17:21,610
It was a long strip of beach.

547
00:17:21,610 --> 00:17:23,143
3, 2, 1.

548
00:17:23,143 --> 00:17:24,576
We like the sound of that.

549
00:17:24,576 --> 00:17:25,376
3, 2.

550
00:17:29,310 --> 00:17:31,410
(Surprised)

551
00:17:31,743 --> 00:17:32,543
He's cute.

552
00:17:32,543 --> 00:17:33,843
He doesn't know this song.

553
00:17:33,843 --> 00:17:36,310
- Let's check out 3 and 2 first. / - He doesn't know.

554
00:17:36,310 --> 00:17:38,276
Only his hair is old-fashioned. He doesn't know.

555
00:17:40,043 --> 00:17:41,743
He has the SOLID hairstyle.

556
00:17:41,743 --> 00:17:43,110
- SOLID hairstyle. / - Lee Jun.

557
00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:45,776
- Lee Jun's hair. / - He uses a tub of gel.

558
00:17:45,776 --> 00:17:50,176
Boracay is the best from December to May.

559
00:17:50,176 --> 00:17:51,943
- Why? The weather? / - The peak season.

560
00:17:51,943 --> 00:17:53,943
- I see. / - The weather's great and so is the air.

561
00:17:53,943 --> 00:17:55,443
Prices go up a little but...

562
00:17:55,443 --> 00:17:56,243
Prices go up?

563
00:17:56,243 --> 00:17:58,443
- Just a bit. / - But that's normal during peak season.

564
00:17:58,443 --> 00:18:00,143
Aren't you hungry?

565
00:18:00,143 --> 00:18:02,976
We'll walk toward Station 2 as we feel the ocean.

566
00:18:02,976 --> 00:18:04,676
Boracay is very famous for

567
00:18:04,676 --> 00:18:05,776
it's steaks.

568
00:18:05,776 --> 00:18:07,143
We should cut up some steak since we're here.

569
00:18:07,143 --> 00:18:09,576
- So this is connected to Station 1? / - Yes.

570
00:18:09,576 --> 00:18:11,476
You'll lose weight if you walk to there. Too far.

571
00:18:11,476 --> 00:18:13,010
It's like 6, 7km.

572
00:18:13,010 --> 00:18:13,910
Amazing.

573
00:18:15,310 --> 00:18:16,276
We're here.

574
00:18:16,276 --> 00:18:17,410
You can walk along the beach.

575
00:18:17,410 --> 00:18:19,043
I was grateful to Gyeonghwan...

576
00:18:19,043 --> 00:18:21,143
- But I'm grateful to Ryan too. / - Yes.

577
00:18:21,943 --> 00:18:23,010
For people who live there...

578
00:18:23,010 --> 00:18:26,076
- Taking care of guests is work. / - That's true.

579
00:18:26,076 --> 00:18:27,243
- Is that it? / - Yes.

580
00:18:27,243 --> 00:18:28,443
Jihye, look at that.

581
00:18:28,443 --> 00:18:29,910
The ambience here is great.

582
00:18:30,476 --> 00:18:33,576
Koreans don't know Station 3.

583
00:18:34,376 --> 00:18:35,243
Check it out.

584
00:18:35,243 --> 00:18:36,476
I love places like this.

585
00:18:37,376 --> 00:18:38,376
Here's the menu.

586
00:18:38,376 --> 00:18:39,976
- The menu? / - It's here?

587
00:18:39,976 --> 00:18:41,843
If you look, the burgers are good here

588
00:18:41,843 --> 00:18:42,976
and so is the salad.

589
00:18:42,976 --> 00:18:44,876
Steak with beer...

590
00:18:44,876 --> 00:18:46,143
- At the beach? / - Yes.

591
00:18:46,143 --> 00:18:48,510
The menu is as thick as an encyclopedia.

592
00:18:48,510 --> 00:18:49,476
It's so big.

593
00:18:50,610 --> 00:18:52,676
(There are more English descriptions than photos)

594
00:18:53,410 --> 00:18:54,976
(If this is the case)

595
00:18:55,276 --> 00:18:56,976
Let's stand up.

596
00:18:56,976 --> 00:18:59,210
This is how they hand over documents at the summit.

597
00:18:59,210 --> 00:19:00,576
We'll hand the menu over to you.

598
00:19:00,576 --> 00:19:01,210
Thank you.

599
00:19:01,210 --> 00:19:02,710
Me too.

600
00:19:02,710 --> 00:19:03,510
Thank you.

601
00:19:05,243 --> 00:19:06,410
What's happening?

602
00:19:06,410 --> 00:19:07,676
- You want me to order for you? / - That's right.

603
00:19:07,676 --> 00:19:08,976
- You want me to order for you? / - That's right.

604
00:19:08,976 --> 00:19:10,476
- That's right. / - He's so nice.

605
00:19:10,476 --> 00:19:12,143
He always plays along.

606
00:19:14,510 --> 00:19:15,243
Filipino language.

607
00:19:15,243 --> 00:19:16,510
It's Tagalog.

608
00:19:16,510 --> 00:19:17,410
He's extremely fluent.

609
00:19:18,543 --> 00:19:21,276
Big size, big size.

610
00:19:21,276 --> 00:19:22,943
White wine.

611
00:19:22,943 --> 00:19:24,143
One glass of white wine.

612
00:19:26,443 --> 00:19:28,543
He brought a new sheet of paper

613
00:19:28,543 --> 00:19:30,443
and he's filled it to the bottom.

614
00:19:31,143 --> 00:19:32,676
Is this a group order?

615
00:19:33,610 --> 00:19:34,943
We ordered so much

616
00:19:34,943 --> 00:19:37,143
that they've come out of the kitchen.

617
00:19:37,143 --> 00:19:38,776
They're wondering who put in such an order.

618
00:19:38,776 --> 00:19:40,710
I'm guessing this the most

619
00:19:40,710 --> 00:19:43,376
that three people have ever ordered at this place.

620
00:19:45,243 --> 00:19:47,410
Buffalo wings. Spicy chicken.

621
00:19:47,410 --> 00:19:49,376
- Look so good. / - Looks delicious.

622
00:19:49,376 --> 00:19:50,543
- It's for beer. / - Buffalo wings.

623
00:19:50,543 --> 00:19:51,476
It's beer.

624
00:19:51,476 --> 00:19:53,176
It tastes exactly like you expect it to taste.

625
00:19:53,176 --> 00:19:55,276
- It's that exact flavor? / - Yes.

626
00:20:00,676 --> 00:20:02,676
Let me debone a wing for you.

627
00:20:02,676 --> 00:20:03,810
There's a way to do that.

628
00:20:03,810 --> 00:20:06,276
Grab the bone,

629
00:20:06,276 --> 00:20:07,976
and turn it twice

630
00:20:07,976 --> 00:20:09,110
like you're turning a screwdriver.

631
00:20:09,110 --> 00:20:10,543
Then you can separate the bone like this. Look.

632
00:20:10,543 --> 00:20:11,476
Right?

633
00:20:11,476 --> 00:20:12,543
Turn this one twice too.

634
00:20:12,543 --> 00:20:14,543
You just need to turn it twice.

635
00:20:14,543 --> 00:20:16,076
And you can give the love of your life...

636
00:20:16,076 --> 00:20:18,410
- It's all meat. / - A boneless chicken wing.

637
00:20:18,410 --> 00:20:19,410
You can do that for her.

638
00:20:21,410 --> 00:20:22,476
There's no bone, right?

639
00:20:23,310 --> 00:20:24,243
It's completely boneless.

640
00:20:24,243 --> 00:20:25,010
What is it?

641
00:20:25,843 --> 00:20:26,910
There's a bone.

642
00:20:26,910 --> 00:20:27,576
Did you bite on something?

643
00:20:27,576 --> 00:20:29,810
- Did you? / - Don't do this to me.

644
00:20:30,143 --> 00:20:30,943
I'll spit it out here.

645
00:20:32,076 --> 00:20:33,343
Boneless chicken.

646
00:20:33,343 --> 00:20:34,210
Isn't it great?

647
00:20:34,210 --> 00:20:36,376
What do the locals usually eat?

648
00:20:36,376 --> 00:20:38,410
The locals eat bread. It's called pandesal.

649
00:20:39,176 --> 00:20:42,076
That's why when you go to a club

650
00:20:42,076 --> 00:20:44,843
that opened for the first time 30 years ago,

651
00:20:44,843 --> 00:20:46,676
they drink beer from jam jars because

652
00:20:46,676 --> 00:20:48,910
they have so many jars left over.

653
00:20:48,910 --> 00:20:49,643
Really?

654
00:20:49,643 --> 00:20:50,876
That's the history.

655
00:20:51,876 --> 00:20:52,976
That's interesting.

656
00:20:52,976 --> 00:20:54,410
Isn't this the great thing about having a guide?

657
00:20:54,410 --> 00:20:55,743
Of course. You need to hear these stories.

658
00:20:57,310 --> 00:20:59,210
Here's the steak which is the main dish.

659
00:20:59,210 --> 00:21:00,943
Is that the steak?

660
00:21:00,943 --> 00:21:01,710
It's so thick.

661
00:21:01,710 --> 00:21:02,710
Look how thick it is.

662
00:21:04,810 --> 00:21:06,043
Jihye, you have a taste first.

663
00:21:06,043 --> 00:21:07,310
Hold on. Let me do this.

664
00:21:07,310 --> 00:21:08,176
- Check out the thickness. / - Like so...

665
00:21:12,410 --> 00:21:14,576
- Hurry, hurry. / - The juices are dripping.

666
00:21:14,576 --> 00:21:16,176
Hurry up and eat it!

667
00:21:16,176 --> 00:21:17,910
Drip, drip.

668
00:21:17,910 --> 00:21:19,643
I'm drooling.

669
00:21:19,643 --> 00:21:20,610
You first, Jihye.

670
00:21:22,210 --> 00:21:23,110
Thanks.

671
00:21:25,910 --> 00:21:26,676
Is it hot?

672
00:21:29,176 --> 00:21:30,210
What the?

673
00:21:30,210 --> 00:21:31,276
- It was too hot. / - Why?

674
00:21:31,276 --> 00:21:32,676
- It was too hot. / - What are you doing?

675
00:21:32,676 --> 00:21:34,110
- You should've held it in. / - It was hot.

676
00:21:34,110 --> 00:21:35,810
- So what? / -She's very honest.

677
00:21:35,810 --> 00:21:37,543
You should've kept it in for the show.

678
00:21:37,543 --> 00:21:38,376
You should've burned the roof of your mouth.

679
00:21:38,376 --> 00:21:40,876
That's a given.

680
00:21:40,876 --> 00:21:42,376
I thought a frog jumped out of her mouth.

681
00:21:44,910 --> 00:21:49,010
(So far, they're enjoying their fancy meal)

682
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:54,776
The texture is different to the steak we normally have.

683
00:21:54,776 --> 00:21:56,743
Thin steak melts in your mouth.

684
00:21:56,743 --> 00:21:57,576
It's really good.

685
00:21:57,576 --> 00:21:59,176
I don't like steak that just melts.

686
00:21:59,176 --> 00:22:00,776
You want something you can chew on.

687
00:22:00,776 --> 00:22:02,443
- Nice and chewy. / - Kind of rough.

688
00:22:04,410 --> 00:22:06,110
But you can find buffalo wings and steaks...

689
00:22:06,110 --> 00:22:07,910
We eat them in Korea too.

690
00:22:07,910 --> 00:22:09,676
- Eat it at Itaewon. / - Yes, but it's just the start.

691
00:22:09,676 --> 00:22:12,376
- I'm sorry. / - But you can get that local flavor.

692
00:22:12,376 --> 00:22:14,043
- You're sorry? / - You're sorry?

693
00:22:14,610 --> 00:22:16,510
I wanted to eat it so bad.

694
00:22:16,510 --> 00:22:18,443
It's known as the 5 "S."

695
00:22:18,443 --> 00:22:19,976
- So 5 things that start with "S?" / - "S?"

696
00:22:19,976 --> 00:22:20,976
5 "S."

697
00:22:20,976 --> 00:22:21,643
Sexy?

698
00:22:21,643 --> 00:22:23,510
- Sexy? / - Sexy.

699
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:27,310
- You can find sexy in Gangnam. / - ♪ You're so sexy ♪

700
00:22:28,543 --> 00:22:29,410
You are sexy.

701
00:22:29,410 --> 00:22:31,443
Clubs in Gangnam played this song often.

702
00:22:31,443 --> 00:22:33,010
- Sea. / - Sea. The ocean.

703
00:22:33,010 --> 00:22:34,510
- Okay. One right. / - Correct.

704
00:22:34,510 --> 00:22:37,176
- Sky. / - Sky, correct.

705
00:22:37,976 --> 00:22:40,043
This is the best part of trips.

706
00:22:40,043 --> 00:22:41,176
Secret.

707
00:22:42,543 --> 00:22:43,410
- Wrong. / - Secret.

708
00:22:44,276 --> 00:22:45,343
5 p.m.

709
00:22:46,910 --> 00:22:47,510
Sunset!

710
00:22:47,510 --> 00:22:48,910
- Sunset. / - Sunset.

711
00:22:48,910 --> 00:22:50,243
- Sunset. / - Sunset.

712
00:22:50,243 --> 00:22:51,276
- Right. / - Sunset.

713
00:22:51,276 --> 00:22:52,210
Do you know Noel?

714
00:22:52,210 --> 00:22:52,876
I know it.

715
00:22:52,876 --> 00:22:56,576
- ♪ I miss you, I miss you ♪ / - ♪ I miss you ♪

716
00:22:56,576 --> 00:23:00,110
- ♪ I miss you, I miss you ♪ / - ♪ I miss you ♪

717
00:23:00,110 --> 00:23:05,576
♪ Because I miss you so much ♪

718
00:23:05,576 --> 00:23:06,343
Not that Noel.

719
00:23:06,343 --> 00:23:08,376
- The sunset. / - Oh, the sunset.

720
00:23:08,376 --> 00:23:09,376
It's really beautiful.

721
00:23:10,710 --> 00:23:11,843
That's what I meant.

722
00:23:13,243 --> 00:23:15,776
It's so cool. You can go down further if you want.

723
00:23:15,776 --> 00:23:17,610
Goodness, it's a turtle.

724
00:23:17,610 --> 00:23:18,610
What is that?

725
00:23:18,610 --> 00:23:19,610
A turtle.

726
00:23:19,610 --> 00:23:20,843
We're flying. We're flying now.

727
00:23:21,510 --> 00:23:22,643
We're flying.

728
00:23:24,743 --> 00:23:25,543
Unbelievable.

729
00:23:27,543 --> 00:23:29,010
Sunset.

730
00:23:30,010 --> 00:23:31,910
- It really is breathtaking. / - So pretty.

731
00:23:32,676 --> 00:23:33,876
This isn't a postcard.

732
00:23:33,876 --> 00:23:34,843
That's amazing.

733
00:23:34,843 --> 00:23:37,376
It disappears in a moment.

734
00:23:38,076 --> 00:23:39,310
The stars are so pretty.

735
00:23:42,010 --> 00:23:43,710
The atmosphere seems great there.

736
00:23:43,710 --> 00:23:45,776
They're the best parts of Boracay.

737
00:23:45,776 --> 00:23:46,510
Amazing.

738
00:23:46,510 --> 00:23:48,176
Now that we've eaten, next up...

739
00:23:48,176 --> 00:23:50,943
Of the 5 "S," we'll do the sky.

740
00:23:51,976 --> 00:23:53,710
- A helicopter tour is expensive. / - A helicopter tour?

741
00:23:53,710 --> 00:23:55,243
- Yes. / - That would've been really expensive.

742
00:23:55,243 --> 00:23:56,110
Jihye and Boom.

743
00:23:56,110 --> 00:23:58,343
- I've never been on one. / - It's hot to walk around.

744
00:23:59,210 --> 00:24:00,410
And it's far.

745
00:24:00,410 --> 00:24:02,143
Then use the e-trike.

746
00:24:02,143 --> 00:24:02,976
E-trike?

747
00:24:02,976 --> 00:24:03,843
Use this to get around.

748
00:24:03,843 --> 00:24:05,910
- You can get on right away? / - Yes.

749
00:24:05,910 --> 00:24:07,176
Grab one that's waiting

750
00:24:07,176 --> 00:24:08,610
and for a dollar or two...

751
00:24:08,610 --> 00:24:10,443
- You can bargain the rate? / - Yes.

752
00:24:10,443 --> 00:24:12,476
I love the color. It's so pink.

753
00:24:12,476 --> 00:24:13,376
It's the perfect color.

754
00:24:13,376 --> 00:24:14,943
It's pretty.

755
00:24:14,943 --> 00:24:15,710
So cute.

756
00:24:15,710 --> 00:24:17,410
You must post a photo of that trike.

757
00:24:17,410 --> 00:24:19,376
I want to buy one.

758
00:24:21,810 --> 00:24:22,810
30 minutes.

759
00:24:22,810 --> 00:24:24,510
- 30 minutes. / - The island is quite small.

760
00:24:25,776 --> 00:24:27,310
It's windy.

761
00:24:27,310 --> 00:24:29,243
The weather here is amazing.

762
00:24:29,243 --> 00:24:32,043
Of the 5 "S" that I mentioned...

763
00:24:32,043 --> 00:24:33,276
Which one is it?

764
00:24:33,276 --> 00:24:34,910
This is sky.

765
00:24:34,910 --> 00:24:35,576
- Sky? / - Sky.

766
00:24:35,576 --> 00:24:36,843
The sky in Boracay is beautiful.

767
00:24:36,843 --> 00:24:38,410
Yes, it is beautiful indeed.

768
00:24:38,410 --> 00:24:39,576
We are hiking, right?

769
00:24:39,576 --> 00:24:42,010
We'll be close to the sky.

770
00:24:42,010 --> 00:24:43,510
Please come this way.

771
00:24:43,510 --> 00:24:44,876
I prepared this for you two.

772
00:24:44,876 --> 00:24:46,176
Seriously, it's so...

773
00:24:46,176 --> 00:24:48,043
I have to live off instant noodles for a week now.

774
00:24:48,043 --> 00:24:49,710
- What is it? / - I prepared this for you.

775
00:24:49,710 --> 00:24:51,276
I prepared this.

776
00:24:51,276 --> 00:24:52,376
You mean it?

777
00:24:52,376 --> 00:24:53,710
Come this way.

778
00:24:53,710 --> 00:24:55,810
The helicopter was just right there.

779
00:24:56,143 --> 00:24:58,676
(We'll go up to the sky on that?)

780
00:24:59,343 --> 00:25:01,176
I'm slightly afraid of heights.

781
00:25:01,176 --> 00:25:05,110
I can go up to 5 to 7m...

782
00:25:05,110 --> 00:25:06,976
5m is only this high!

783
00:25:06,976 --> 00:25:09,210
I prefer being safe.

784
00:25:09,210 --> 00:25:11,576
You're easily scared.

785
00:25:13,043 --> 00:25:14,376
- Why don't you get on it? / - Don't be like that.

786
00:25:14,376 --> 00:25:16,710
This must be an aviation museum.

787
00:25:16,710 --> 00:25:17,843
No, it's not a museum.

788
00:25:17,843 --> 00:25:18,543
What is that?

789
00:25:18,543 --> 00:25:19,910
Why is that drone so big?

790
00:25:19,910 --> 00:25:21,343
- Let me control it. / - That's not a drone.

791
00:25:21,343 --> 00:25:23,010
- It's not? / - It's not.

792
00:25:23,010 --> 00:25:24,210
Get on it.

793
00:25:24,210 --> 00:25:25,476
Is this for real?

794
00:25:25,476 --> 00:25:26,410
Come this way.

795
00:25:26,976 --> 00:25:27,743
Look here.

796
00:25:27,743 --> 00:25:29,743
Hop on for now.

797
00:25:29,743 --> 00:25:30,843
Step inside...

798
00:25:30,843 --> 00:25:32,510
- No... / - First...

799
00:25:32,510 --> 00:25:34,310
It's hired on a timed rate.

800
00:25:34,310 --> 00:25:35,943
If it goes over 30 minutes, it gets very expensive.

801
00:25:36,810 --> 00:25:39,476
- Are we really flying in this? / - Just get on first.

802
00:25:39,476 --> 00:25:40,976
- Is this for real? / -  Just go in.

803
00:25:41,576 --> 00:25:42,810
You don't have to take off your slippers.

804
00:25:42,810 --> 00:25:44,376
We're really using this?

805
00:25:44,376 --> 00:25:45,643
(Sealed in)

806
00:25:45,643 --> 00:25:47,243
- Goodness. / - What's this?

807
00:25:47,243 --> 00:25:49,876
He didn't mention this beforehand.

808
00:25:49,876 --> 00:25:51,010
You're slim so...

809
00:25:51,010 --> 00:25:52,243
- Be careful. / - Really?

810
00:25:54,376 --> 00:25:55,810
Driver on call.

811
00:25:57,476 --> 00:25:59,576
He just turned on the engine.

812
00:25:59,576 --> 00:26:00,543
Wait, isn't Ryan getting on?

813
00:26:00,543 --> 00:26:01,343
He didn't.

814
00:26:01,343 --> 00:26:03,243
Saying he's scared of heights.

815
00:26:03,243 --> 00:26:06,643
Ryan just dumped us in here.

816
00:26:06,643 --> 00:26:08,610
I'm scared of heights so...

817
00:26:08,610 --> 00:26:10,276
When you ride it for the first time,

818
00:26:10,276 --> 00:26:12,076
you do get nervous.

819
00:26:12,076 --> 00:26:14,676
You get a little nervous when it goes up.

820
00:26:14,676 --> 00:26:16,043
He's saying he's the worst.

821
00:26:16,043 --> 00:26:17,543
He's not getting along with the guide.

822
00:26:20,310 --> 00:26:21,610
That's when it's the scariest.

823
00:26:21,610 --> 00:26:23,076
- It's scary. / - That is scary.

824
00:26:23,076 --> 00:26:23,810
Really?

825
00:26:23,810 --> 00:26:25,210
It's really scary.

826
00:26:25,210 --> 00:26:26,076
We're going up.

827
00:26:30,910 --> 00:26:31,676
Amazing.

828
00:26:31,676 --> 00:26:32,743
Wow, amazing.

829
00:26:33,443 --> 00:26:36,210
The wind is strong so it'll shake a lot.

830
00:26:36,210 --> 00:26:37,676
It'll be really pretty though.

831
00:26:38,643 --> 00:26:39,876
Wow. Oh, my God.

832
00:26:39,876 --> 00:26:41,376
Oh, my God.

833
00:26:42,576 --> 00:26:43,843
Using all the English he knows.

834
00:26:43,843 --> 00:26:44,943
This is crazy.

835
00:26:44,943 --> 00:26:45,976
He's scared.

836
00:26:46,710 --> 00:26:47,643
He's scared.

837
00:26:48,376 --> 00:26:49,676
Jihye, look.

838
00:26:51,676 --> 00:26:53,910
(He's really happy now)

839
00:26:54,110 --> 00:26:56,010
Forget being scared.

840
00:26:56,010 --> 00:26:57,610
It's so beautiful.

841
00:26:57,610 --> 00:26:58,710
He took a turn.

842
00:26:59,743 --> 00:27:00,976
Look at the island. Jihye, look.

843
00:27:02,076 --> 00:27:04,976
Jihye, we are about to see Stage 1, 2, 3.

844
00:27:04,976 --> 00:27:06,343
It's Station not Stage.

845
00:27:06,876 --> 00:27:07,510
We perform on a stage.

846
00:27:07,510 --> 00:27:08,876
This is Station.

847
00:27:08,876 --> 00:27:10,476
- Stage 1, 2, 3? / - Stage.

848
00:27:12,176 --> 00:27:14,243
It's like three stages.

849
00:27:14,243 --> 00:27:17,043
We can see the harbor where we took the ferry.

850
00:27:18,376 --> 00:27:19,243
There's the harbor.

851
00:27:19,243 --> 00:27:20,743
You can see everything.

852
00:27:21,476 --> 00:27:23,776
I can't believe I get to see Boracay from the sky.

853
00:27:23,776 --> 00:27:25,076
This is spectacular.

854
00:27:25,076 --> 00:27:26,443
What a fantastic view.

855
00:27:26,443 --> 00:27:29,776
♪ I believe I can fly ♪

856
00:27:29,776 --> 00:27:33,143
♪ I believe I can touch the sky ♪

857
00:27:33,143 --> 00:27:36,343
♪ I think about it every night and day ♪

858
00:27:37,276 --> 00:27:39,076
I don't know the lyrics.

859
00:27:40,376 --> 00:27:41,610
Wow, beautiful.

860
00:27:41,610 --> 00:27:43,710
Look at the shape of the island.

861
00:27:45,410 --> 00:27:48,243
It looks different from there.

862
00:27:48,243 --> 00:27:49,510
From this point of view,

863
00:27:49,510 --> 00:27:52,543
it's not a big island but it's definitely beautiful.

864
00:27:52,543 --> 00:27:55,110
Now, I understand why Ryan prepared this for us.

865
00:27:56,943 --> 00:27:59,643
The water there is so clean.

866
00:27:59,643 --> 00:28:00,910
Even from up here.

867
00:28:00,910 --> 00:28:02,610
Say that if you're a couple...

868
00:28:02,610 --> 00:28:04,910
- It's worth taking a ride. / - I agree.

869
00:28:04,910 --> 00:28:06,576
- You can confess your love up there. / - Right.

870
00:28:06,576 --> 00:28:09,410
You should take 10,000 photos in the air.

871
00:28:10,143 --> 00:28:12,310
Jihye, I see where we're going to land.

872
00:28:12,310 --> 00:28:14,443
(I can see you too)

873
00:28:14,776 --> 00:28:16,043
Why is it going down so fast?

874
00:28:16,043 --> 00:28:17,176
Slow down...

875
00:28:19,143 --> 00:28:20,610
(The helicopter is about to land)

876
00:28:20,610 --> 00:28:22,643
(Argh)

877
00:28:28,043 --> 00:28:30,010
(A perfect landing)

878
00:28:31,310 --> 00:28:32,676
His face just changed.

879
00:28:33,243 --> 00:28:34,543
He's relieved to be alive.

880
00:28:35,543 --> 00:28:37,476
- Captain! Captain! / - Captain! Captain!

881
00:28:37,476 --> 00:28:38,310
- Captain! / - Captain!

882
00:28:38,310 --> 00:28:39,643
Hey, that's overdoing it.

883
00:28:40,310 --> 00:28:42,076
Why would you bow to the helicopter?

884
00:28:42,076 --> 00:28:43,343
I'm just so thankful.

885
00:28:43,343 --> 00:28:43,943
Wasn't it fun?

886
00:28:43,943 --> 00:28:45,476
Isn't that too excessive?

887
00:28:45,476 --> 00:28:47,810
My knees are very glossy

888
00:28:47,810 --> 00:28:49,076
because I kneel down so often.

889
00:28:49,076 --> 00:28:49,976
Wasn't it beautiful?

890
00:28:49,976 --> 00:28:51,076
It was beautiful.

891
00:28:51,076 --> 00:28:54,010
I was nervous but I saw such a beautiful scenery.

892
00:28:54,010 --> 00:28:56,810
A weird sensation surged through me.

893
00:28:56,810 --> 00:28:58,376
Everyone should try this.

894
00:28:58,376 --> 00:28:59,943
Of the 5 "S..."

895
00:28:59,943 --> 00:29:02,476
- Sky. The sky is beautiful, right? / - Yes.

896
00:29:02,476 --> 00:29:03,710
- I agree. / - This time...

897
00:29:03,710 --> 00:29:05,443
We'll check out another "S."

898
00:29:05,443 --> 00:29:06,310
Where will we go?

899
00:29:06,310 --> 00:29:07,643
To the sea.

900
00:29:07,643 --> 00:29:09,543
Then let's ride the helicopter and dive into the water.

901
00:29:10,376 --> 00:29:12,243
Okay. Let's take it slow.

902
00:29:12,243 --> 00:29:13,776
- Yes, we'll take it slow. / - Do you have red ginseng?

903
00:29:15,243 --> 00:29:16,043
You went snorkeling.

904
00:29:16,043 --> 00:29:17,243
- You learned how to free-dive? / - Yes.

905
00:29:17,243 --> 00:29:18,343
Free-diving.

906
00:29:19,010 --> 00:29:20,876
You just dive down.

907
00:29:20,876 --> 00:29:22,243
It's really fun once you're hooked.

908
00:29:23,610 --> 00:29:25,276
Of the 5 "S..."

909
00:29:25,276 --> 00:29:26,676
We saw Boracay's sky.

910
00:29:26,676 --> 00:29:29,043
We need to focus.

911
00:29:29,043 --> 00:29:29,810
And?

912
00:29:29,810 --> 00:29:31,643
This time...

913
00:29:31,643 --> 00:29:32,810
Of the 5 "S..."

914
00:29:32,810 --> 00:29:34,143
We'll go to sea.

915
00:29:34,143 --> 00:29:34,976
- Sea. / - The sea.

916
00:29:34,976 --> 00:29:37,043
- We need to go in the water. / - You're coming too?

917
00:29:37,043 --> 00:29:40,176
It's beautiful to observe the sea in Boracay

918
00:29:40,176 --> 00:29:41,710
but it's even more beautiful underwater.

919
00:29:41,710 --> 00:29:44,210
That's why I prepared free-diving as an activity.

920
00:29:44,210 --> 00:29:45,210
- Free-diving. / - Be free.

921
00:29:45,210 --> 00:29:46,743
Normally, for free-diving...

922
00:29:48,076 --> 00:29:49,510
You go in without the oxygen tank.

923
00:29:49,510 --> 00:29:51,110
you go in without the oxygen tank.

924
00:29:51,110 --> 00:29:52,776
It's probably with no oxygen.

925
00:29:52,776 --> 00:29:53,710
The oxygen mask...

926
00:29:53,710 --> 00:29:55,143
Jihye, have fun.

927
00:29:55,143 --> 00:29:56,310
I'll see you later.

928
00:29:56,310 --> 00:29:58,076
Why would we remove our masks?

929
00:29:58,076 --> 00:29:59,610
- You have to come. / - Why remove our masks?

930
00:29:59,610 --> 00:30:02,176
How could you think about ditching me?

931
00:30:02,176 --> 00:30:04,510
(What is free-diving?)

932
00:30:08,110 --> 00:30:09,310
We go in without the oxygen tank.

933
00:30:09,310 --> 00:30:11,376
- You dive in without any gear? / - Yes, yes.

934
00:30:11,376 --> 00:30:12,310
Without any gear.

935
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:14,543
First, you grab the rope to go down.

936
00:30:14,543 --> 00:30:15,710
I've tried that before.

937
00:30:15,710 --> 00:30:17,443
It gets tough because your ears ring.

938
00:30:22,310 --> 00:30:23,976
We're heading to the Boracay sea.

939
00:30:23,976 --> 00:30:24,876
Let's go.

940
00:30:24,876 --> 00:30:28,176
(Let's go and free-dive)

941
00:30:28,610 --> 00:30:31,443
(They head to the free-diving spot)

942
00:30:31,443 --> 00:30:32,410
Look at the color of the water.

943
00:30:32,410 --> 00:30:34,443
The color of the sea is so pretty.

944
00:30:34,443 --> 00:30:36,176
Welcome to Boracay!

945
00:30:38,376 --> 00:30:42,376
(You can't not sing here!)

946
00:30:44,810 --> 00:30:46,043
It's a tough experience.

947
00:30:46,043 --> 00:30:48,210
Look at Ryan.

948
00:30:48,210 --> 00:30:49,043
Ryan Bang...

949
00:30:49,043 --> 00:30:52,043
It was the same for Gyeonghwan.

950
00:30:52,043 --> 00:30:53,610
They get exhausted on the first day.

951
00:30:53,610 --> 00:30:56,110
- You're right. / - He's aged rapidly.

952
00:30:56,110 --> 00:30:59,210
Go, go. Go, go.

953
00:30:59,210 --> 00:31:02,676
- ♪ Always waiting ♪ / - ♪ Always waiting ♪

954
00:31:02,676 --> 00:31:06,443
♪ Boracay is always waiting ♪

955
00:31:06,443 --> 00:31:07,510
Boracay! Boracay!

956
00:31:07,510 --> 00:31:09,443
Bora, Bora, Boracay!

957
00:31:11,776 --> 00:31:12,976
We're here already?

958
00:31:14,543 --> 00:31:16,543
(Everyone, come here)

959
00:31:18,976 --> 00:31:20,776
It was scary at first.

960
00:31:20,776 --> 00:31:21,743
Was Ryan Bang good?

961
00:31:21,743 --> 00:31:22,943
Yes, he was good.

962
00:31:30,643 --> 00:31:33,076
(Jihye joins them too)

963
00:31:33,243 --> 00:31:35,576
(They are clustered together)

964
00:31:35,576 --> 00:31:36,076
That looks great.

965
00:31:36,076 --> 00:31:37,676
The color of the water is so pretty.

966
00:31:39,143 --> 00:31:42,643
(The instructor demonstrates)

967
00:31:46,710 --> 00:31:47,610
Who is that?

968
00:31:47,610 --> 00:31:49,410
- It's the instructor. / - Oh, the instructor.

969
00:31:53,076 --> 00:31:55,476
(You're so cool)

970
00:31:56,743 --> 00:31:59,376
(Let's dive in without the breathing gear)

971
00:32:00,476 --> 00:32:03,443
It wasn't easy because of the waves.

972
00:32:03,443 --> 00:32:04,710
Plus we were beginners.

973
00:32:04,710 --> 00:32:06,110
Ryan goes down.

974
00:32:06,110 --> 00:32:09,776
(The beginner's course is good for practicing)

975
00:32:12,610 --> 00:32:16,776
(Ryan goes all the way to the bottom in one breath)

976
00:32:19,710 --> 00:32:21,310
(I'm fine)

977
00:32:22,010 --> 00:32:23,943
(They are relieved)

978
00:32:29,410 --> 00:32:30,943
(It's the best)

979
00:32:32,576 --> 00:32:34,943
Since you're going down without oxygen,

980
00:32:34,943 --> 00:32:36,476
I was on my own.

981
00:32:36,476 --> 00:32:38,510
- Right. / - That was the frightening part.

982
00:32:38,510 --> 00:32:39,376
I'm going down now.

983
00:32:39,376 --> 00:32:40,743
- You're taking forever. / - Is that you, Boom?

984
00:32:41,376 --> 00:32:42,876
- That is me. / - Are you really going down?

985
00:32:42,876 --> 00:32:45,076
Don't I look like a fish who doesn't move?

986
00:32:47,776 --> 00:32:50,910
(Going slow)

987
00:32:51,543 --> 00:32:53,810
(I'm out of breath now)

988
00:32:53,810 --> 00:32:55,210
I'm coming back up. I need air.

989
00:32:55,210 --> 00:32:56,610
- He has to return. / - I had to go back up.

990
00:32:56,610 --> 00:32:57,676
On the way up...

991
00:32:57,676 --> 00:32:59,143
I'm really fast on the way up.

992
00:32:59,143 --> 00:33:01,110
- You can't do that. It's dangerous. / - No, no.

993
00:33:01,110 --> 00:33:03,076
When you wear the scuba gear

994
00:33:03,076 --> 00:33:04,943
and breathe in the air,

995
00:33:04,943 --> 00:33:06,043
there's nitrogen too.

996
00:33:06,043 --> 00:33:07,943
That's why coming up fast is dangerous.

997
00:33:07,943 --> 00:33:10,610
But you hold your breath for this,

998
00:33:10,610 --> 00:33:13,110
so it doesn't matter how fast you go up.

999
00:33:13,110 --> 00:33:14,476
Oh.

1000
00:33:22,376 --> 00:33:25,643
(This is a beginner's course, mostly for practicing)

1001
00:33:25,643 --> 00:33:32,676
(But if you're skilled, you can free-dive in various spots)

1002
00:33:35,543 --> 00:33:39,776
(This time, Ryan goes down without holding the rope)

1003
00:33:42,610 --> 00:33:44,876
(I want to go down without holding the rope too)

1004
00:33:46,576 --> 00:33:47,543
What is she doing?

1005
00:33:47,543 --> 00:33:48,710
She's floundering.

1006
00:33:48,710 --> 00:33:50,676
- It's not as easy as you think. / - What is this?

1007
00:33:50,676 --> 00:33:51,710
You should do that under water.

1008
00:33:51,710 --> 00:33:52,810
You should pull yourself down.

1009
00:33:54,010 --> 00:33:55,943
It isn't as easy as you think.

1010
00:33:55,943 --> 00:33:58,176
(This is how you do it)

1011
00:34:02,676 --> 00:34:04,610
(Happy)

1012
00:34:05,910 --> 00:34:07,610
(Safety is important)

1013
00:34:07,610 --> 00:34:08,610
I heard it's fun.

1014
00:34:08,610 --> 00:34:09,576
It is fun.

1015
00:34:09,576 --> 00:34:11,276
I heard it's incredibly fun once you become skilled.

1016
00:34:11,276 --> 00:34:12,843
Once you overcome the fear in the beginning,

1017
00:34:12,843 --> 00:34:14,576
you will enjoy it a lot.

1018
00:34:14,576 --> 00:34:15,876
- It looks fun. / - It's exhilarating.

1019
00:34:16,610 --> 00:34:21,610
(They enjoy their time underwater in Boracay)

1020
00:34:22,743 --> 00:34:24,976
(Let's go back)

1021
00:34:25,943 --> 00:34:29,443
(They're finished with free-diving)

1022
00:34:29,443 --> 00:34:31,276
When you go to a place with clean water,

1023
00:34:31,276 --> 00:34:32,476
you must do things like that.

1024
00:34:32,476 --> 00:34:33,776
- You're right. / - You must see inside the water.

1025
00:34:35,076 --> 00:34:36,043
Applause.

1026
00:34:36,043 --> 00:34:36,943
Free-diving!

1027
00:34:36,943 --> 00:34:38,810
- Free-diving! / - You were great.

1028
00:34:38,810 --> 00:34:40,976
Ryan was great.

1029
00:34:40,976 --> 00:34:42,476
He was leading us underwater,

1030
00:34:42,476 --> 00:34:43,976
which helped us go down deeper...

1031
00:34:43,976 --> 00:34:45,710
- Ryan is... / - Ryan looks very exhausted though.

1032
00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:48,543
- He needs some food. / - He looks down.

1033
00:34:48,543 --> 00:34:49,943
- Ryan looks so exhausted. / - I'm hungry.

1034
00:34:49,943 --> 00:34:51,310
- Hungry, right? / - Yes, I'm hungry.

1035
00:34:51,310 --> 00:34:53,810
We're going to a restaurant in Boracay.

1036
00:34:53,810 --> 00:34:56,476
These days, well-being food is popular in Korea.

1037
00:34:56,476 --> 00:34:58,910
We're going to go eat well-being food.

1038
00:34:58,910 --> 00:35:00,743
- Let's go! / - Let's go!

1039
00:35:00,743 --> 00:35:02,810
- Let's go! / - Let's go!

1040
00:35:02,810 --> 00:35:03,876
Let's go.

1041
00:35:07,143 --> 00:35:10,743
We're going to head out to eat now.

1042
00:35:11,710 --> 00:35:17,210
(5 minutes to the Well-being restaurant)

1043
00:35:17,743 --> 00:35:19,810
This restaurant is known

1044
00:35:19,810 --> 00:35:21,243
for their well-being food.

1045
00:35:21,243 --> 00:35:22,076
We're here.

1046
00:35:22,076 --> 00:35:23,843
- I'm hungry! Let's go. / - Let's go in.

1047
00:35:27,043 --> 00:35:28,810
- What's this? / - This place was really delicious.

1048
00:35:29,776 --> 00:35:31,643
- It looks delicious. / - It's a hip restaurant.

1049
00:35:31,643 --> 00:35:33,776
It's a hip place in Boracay nowadays.

1050
00:35:35,176 --> 00:35:36,376
Well-being food.

1051
00:35:37,076 --> 00:35:39,243
(The well-being meal in Boracay will soon be revealed)

1052
00:35:42,510 --> 00:35:43,443
What is that?

1053
00:35:44,143 --> 00:35:47,043
Tour guides usually prepare gifts.

1054
00:35:47,043 --> 00:35:47,910
What is that?

1055
00:35:47,910 --> 00:35:49,310
Ryan prepared those himself?

1056
00:35:49,310 --> 00:35:50,843
- Yes, he did. / - Souvenir shirts.

1057
00:35:50,843 --> 00:35:52,176
Boracay.

1058
00:35:52,176 --> 00:35:54,310
- It's a T-shirt of this place. / - It's Boracay.

1059
00:35:55,310 --> 00:35:58,376
The local guides sometimes give presents like this

1060
00:35:58,376 --> 00:35:59,343
when they like the tourists they guide.

1061
00:35:59,343 --> 00:36:01,210
Jihye, we saw all this.

1062
00:36:01,210 --> 00:36:01,943
- Right? / - We did.

1063
00:36:01,943 --> 00:36:03,310
We took off here and...

1064
00:36:04,043 --> 00:36:05,976
- We flew around the island. / - It was this shape.

1065
00:36:05,976 --> 00:36:07,143
The shape of a janggu.

1066
00:36:07,143 --> 00:36:09,176
I can't just sit like this when I got a present.

1067
00:36:09,176 --> 00:36:10,943
I think we should give him something as well.

1068
00:36:12,143 --> 00:36:14,343
I heard you guys were coming

1069
00:36:14,343 --> 00:36:15,743
so I prepared something.

1070
00:36:15,743 --> 00:36:18,110
Please open it. It's a T-shirt.

1071
00:36:18,110 --> 00:36:19,576
Jihye.

1072
00:36:19,576 --> 00:36:20,710
What's this? Wait a minute.

1073
00:36:20,710 --> 00:36:21,643
Wait a minute.

1074
00:36:21,643 --> 00:36:22,476
Go ahead.

1075
00:36:22,476 --> 00:36:23,476
It's fine.

1076
00:36:23,476 --> 00:36:26,543
What is this? It's Boom T-shirt.

1077
00:36:26,543 --> 00:36:27,043
It's a Boom shirt.

1078
00:36:27,043 --> 00:36:28,010
Feel free to wear it anytime.

1079
00:36:28,010 --> 00:36:29,510
Look on the back side.

1080
00:36:29,510 --> 00:36:30,776
Who is this?

1081
00:36:30,776 --> 00:36:31,943
It's me.

1082
00:36:31,943 --> 00:36:33,976
Gold comes out of my mouth.

1083
00:36:33,976 --> 00:36:35,510
And this...

1084
00:36:35,510 --> 00:36:36,610
This is my signed CD.

1085
00:36:39,776 --> 00:36:41,510
You took your CDs all the way there?

1086
00:36:41,510 --> 00:36:42,576
This is my signed CD.

1087
00:36:42,576 --> 00:36:44,143
What's with these signed CDs?

1088
00:36:44,143 --> 00:36:45,543
Thank you so much.

1089
00:36:45,543 --> 00:36:46,410
You don't have to thank me.

1090
00:36:46,410 --> 00:36:47,643
I have about 400 of them at home.

1091
00:36:48,510 --> 00:36:50,176
I have too many CDs at home.

1092
00:36:51,143 --> 00:36:52,810
Leftovers.

1093
00:36:52,810 --> 00:36:55,076
It's a barbecue burger with kimchi.

1094
00:36:55,076 --> 00:36:55,810
Well-being.

1095
00:36:57,643 --> 00:36:59,110
- That looks delicious. / - That looks delicious.

1096
00:36:59,110 --> 00:37:00,710
- It was incredibly good. / - I'd love that.

1097
00:37:00,710 --> 00:37:03,776
The kimchi is homemade from the restaurant.

1098
00:37:06,910 --> 00:37:08,676
That must taste very unique.

1099
00:37:08,676 --> 00:37:10,210
After diving, we were so hungry.

1100
00:37:12,643 --> 00:37:15,643
In this restaurant, they make the kimchi themselves.

1101
00:37:15,643 --> 00:37:17,376
It's a new kind of dish.

1102
00:37:17,376 --> 00:37:19,110
I should just eat it with hands

1103
00:37:19,110 --> 00:37:20,610
rather than use forks and knives.

1104
00:37:22,843 --> 00:37:24,210
Let me try.

1105
00:37:24,210 --> 00:37:26,410
The viewers would not know

1106
00:37:26,410 --> 00:37:28,043
that we're in Boracay.

1107
00:37:29,576 --> 00:37:30,210
It's tasty, isn't it?

1108
00:37:31,076 --> 00:37:32,910
The person who made this kimchi must be a master.

1109
00:37:32,910 --> 00:37:34,076
It's so good.

1110
00:37:34,076 --> 00:37:35,243
They make good kimchi.

1111
00:37:35,243 --> 00:37:37,410
The kimchi was very delicious. I was surprised.

1112
00:37:38,376 --> 00:37:39,543
The bun looks really good.

1113
00:37:39,543 --> 00:37:40,210
The bun as good.

1114
00:37:40,210 --> 00:37:43,643
I didn't think the bun and kimchi would go together

1115
00:37:43,643 --> 00:37:46,643
but it tastes like rice with toppings.

1116
00:37:46,643 --> 00:37:47,476
You're right.

1117
00:37:47,476 --> 00:37:48,743
It tastes a bit like boiled pork too.

1118
00:37:48,743 --> 00:37:51,676
- It does. / - This meat is the brisket.

1119
00:37:51,676 --> 00:37:53,043
It's used in jangjorim.

1120
00:37:53,043 --> 00:37:55,710
With kimchi, it tastes like boiled pork.

1121
00:37:55,710 --> 00:37:57,210
It must be like eating jangjorim,

1122
00:37:57,210 --> 00:37:58,943
kimchi and rice.

1123
00:37:58,943 --> 00:38:01,043
It's similar to that but it's a little different.

1124
00:38:01,676 --> 00:38:02,710
It's so delicious.

1125
00:38:03,510 --> 00:38:05,076
This kimchi is very delicious.

1126
00:38:05,676 --> 00:38:08,443
The combination of bun, kimchi and meat

1127
00:38:08,443 --> 00:38:10,376
is something new

1128
00:38:10,376 --> 00:38:11,610
but they go so well.

1129
00:38:11,610 --> 00:38:13,110
They have a lot of great skewer dishes there.

1130
00:38:13,810 --> 00:38:14,843
- The sauce is great. / - Grilled over charcoal.

1131
00:38:14,843 --> 00:38:16,476
Anything grilled on charcoal is delicious.

1132
00:38:19,676 --> 00:38:22,276
You're right. It's barley.

1133
00:38:22,276 --> 00:38:23,943
Wow, it's barley.

1134
00:38:23,943 --> 00:38:26,176
It's charcoaled meat with barley rice.

1135
00:38:26,176 --> 00:38:28,810
This is perfect for Korean palate.

1136
00:38:30,976 --> 00:38:32,410
The barley rice is good too.

1137
00:38:36,276 --> 00:38:37,076
It's so delicious.

1138
00:38:39,010 --> 00:38:40,176
- It's good, isn't it? / - Yes.

1139
00:38:40,176 --> 00:38:41,143
It's like

1140
00:38:41,143 --> 00:38:43,376
cream risotto made with barley...

1141
00:38:43,376 --> 00:38:43,876
And barbecued meat.

1142
00:38:43,876 --> 00:38:45,310
With barbecued meat on it.

1143
00:38:48,910 --> 00:38:50,443
(What is this?)

1144
00:38:50,876 --> 00:38:52,843
This is a Filipino dish called kangkong.

1145
00:38:52,843 --> 00:38:53,710
It looks like spinach.

1146
00:38:53,710 --> 00:38:55,243
Isn't it too strong?

1147
00:38:55,243 --> 00:38:57,010
It's good. It's something Koreans would love.

1148
00:38:57,010 --> 00:38:58,743
This is a common ingredient in China as well.

1149
00:38:59,676 --> 00:39:01,210
- Kangkong. / - Kangkong.

1150
00:39:02,643 --> 00:39:03,676
It's just like herbs, right?

1151
00:39:06,210 --> 00:39:07,976
Hey, this is good.

1152
00:39:09,376 --> 00:39:10,476
Is it soft boiled?

1153
00:39:11,310 --> 00:39:12,276
Yes.

1154
00:39:13,543 --> 00:39:14,976
My gosh.

1155
00:39:14,976 --> 00:39:16,810
Soft boiled eggs are the best.

1156
00:39:16,810 --> 00:39:19,410
- Eggs are good anywhere. / - I liked the chef there.

1157
00:39:20,010 --> 00:39:21,343
Add some kangkong on top.

1158
00:39:21,343 --> 00:39:23,210
Let's add our love on his spoon.

1159
00:39:23,210 --> 00:39:25,043
Let's do that.

1160
00:39:25,543 --> 00:39:28,010
- Add this on the egg? / - Of course.

1161
00:39:32,010 --> 00:39:33,510
- It's soft and delicious, right? / - It is.

1162
00:39:33,510 --> 00:39:35,843
- This is the friendship of Korea. / - Friendship.

1163
00:39:36,343 --> 00:39:37,343
It's so delicious.

1164
00:39:41,543 --> 00:39:43,843
- It's dessert. / - It looks so pretty.

1165
00:39:43,843 --> 00:39:46,576
This dessert was amazing.

1166
00:39:46,576 --> 00:39:47,410
- Mango? / - It's like yogurt...

1167
00:39:47,410 --> 00:39:50,643
- It's the best. / - It's 100% mango puree.

1168
00:39:51,043 --> 00:39:53,276
- That'd be good. / - It was really good.

1169
00:39:53,276 --> 00:39:57,110
- You have to eat fruit there. / - You must eat mango.

1170
00:39:57,110 --> 00:39:59,676
- There's millet in it. / - There's millet and oats.

1171
00:39:59,676 --> 00:40:02,043
There are strawberries, banana, mango.

1172
00:40:02,043 --> 00:40:03,810
And is this mango porridge?

1173
00:40:03,810 --> 00:40:06,643
- Mango. / - I think it's crushed mango.

1174
00:40:06,643 --> 00:40:08,410
It was very thick.

1175
00:40:09,110 --> 00:40:11,143
- I don't think it was thick. / - Oh, yes...

1176
00:40:12,243 --> 00:40:13,543
Are you sure you ate the same thing?

1177
00:40:13,543 --> 00:40:15,110
- It's not thick. It's very soft. / - Excuse me.

1178
00:40:15,110 --> 00:40:16,743
When are you going to have teamwork?

1179
00:40:16,743 --> 00:40:17,976
They use these terms

1180
00:40:17,976 --> 00:40:19,476
on the home shopping network,

1181
00:40:19,476 --> 00:40:20,476
so I tried using it.

1182
00:40:21,543 --> 00:40:23,343
Let's have a bite.

1183
00:40:23,343 --> 00:40:24,410
Let's mix them.

1184
00:40:26,076 --> 00:40:27,176
Look. It looks thick.

1185
00:40:27,176 --> 00:40:28,810
- That doesn't look thick at all. / - It doesn't look thick.

1186
00:40:28,810 --> 00:40:30,410
- It looks soft. / - That would melt in your mouth.

1187
00:40:30,410 --> 00:40:32,476
- It melts in your mouth. / - It melts.

1188
00:40:32,476 --> 00:40:34,143
That would melt in your mouth.

1189
00:40:34,143 --> 00:40:35,543
- Wow. / - It's so good.

1190
00:40:35,543 --> 00:40:39,176
- It kind of feels like baby food. / - Baby food.

1191
00:40:39,176 --> 00:40:40,510
It's similar to pumpkin soup

1192
00:40:40,510 --> 00:40:43,276
but it's cold and refreshing.

1193
00:40:43,276 --> 00:40:45,710
- It's like mango yogurt. / - Yes, it's like yogurt.

1194
00:40:45,710 --> 00:40:46,576
Mango yogurt.

1195
00:40:46,576 --> 00:40:49,410
Things like that bloat in your stomach

1196
00:40:49,410 --> 00:40:51,076
so you feel full for longer.

1197
00:40:51,076 --> 00:40:52,810
It's a good diet food.

1198
00:40:53,643 --> 00:40:55,543
Whatever food Sunyeong explains, I want to eat that.

1199
00:40:56,276 --> 00:40:57,376
Please keep explaining.

1200
00:40:57,376 --> 00:40:59,276
Shall I? Should I add some comments?

1201
00:40:59,276 --> 00:41:01,243
This is the best restaurant in Southeast Asia

1202
00:41:01,243 --> 00:41:02,643
that I've ever been to.

1203
00:41:02,643 --> 00:41:03,743
- Seriously? / - Yes.

1204
00:41:03,743 --> 00:41:06,310
When you travel, you start to miss Korean food

1205
00:41:06,310 --> 00:41:07,543
on the second day.

1206
00:41:07,543 --> 00:41:08,943
- Here, I don't miss Korean food. / - Right?

1207
00:41:08,943 --> 00:41:10,610
- Yeah. / - It's amazing.

1208
00:41:10,610 --> 00:41:11,710
What are we doing next?

1209
00:41:11,710 --> 00:41:14,510
Now we will take a break back at the hotel.

1210
00:41:14,510 --> 00:41:18,476
Then experience the nightlife in Boracay.

1211
00:41:19,443 --> 00:41:21,010
- Club. / - Her eyes are sparkling.

1212
00:41:21,010 --> 00:41:23,510
We actually don't enjoy ourselves much in clubs.

1213
00:41:23,510 --> 00:41:25,443
I'm a married woman

1214
00:41:25,443 --> 00:41:30,443
so I will just briefly drop by the place and leave.

1215
00:41:30,443 --> 00:41:32,276
I'm a little conservative.

1216
00:41:32,276 --> 00:41:34,976
So I just wanted to go there for a short time and leave.

1217
00:41:34,976 --> 00:41:37,910
You're saying this now but you won't change like this

1218
00:41:37,910 --> 00:41:39,176
when you're in there, right?

1219
00:41:39,843 --> 00:41:41,110
What is this?

1220
00:41:41,110 --> 00:41:42,943
She's very conservative.

1221
00:41:42,943 --> 00:41:43,710
What is this?

1222
00:41:43,710 --> 00:41:46,076
She's very conservative.

1223
00:41:46,076 --> 00:41:48,610
Her outfit looks very conservative.

1224
00:41:48,610 --> 00:41:51,943
- Her outfit looks so conservative. / -  Her outfit...

1225
00:41:51,943 --> 00:41:54,443
She looks like a tropical fish in Boracay.

1226
00:41:54,443 --> 00:41:56,510
We're running out of time. We've got to hurry.

1227
00:41:56,510 --> 00:41:57,743
Let's go.

1228
00:41:59,343 --> 00:42:01,310
It's going to be fun this evening.

1229
00:42:08,210 --> 00:42:09,443
Oh, Ryan...

1230
00:42:09,876 --> 00:42:11,610
- Goodness. / - I'm a reflector.

1231
00:42:11,610 --> 00:42:15,476
- I look like a reflector. / - I thought you were a fish.

1232
00:42:15,476 --> 00:42:17,176
You and I are dressed up...

1233
00:42:17,176 --> 00:42:20,043
- But Ryan... / - He took a jacket.

1234
00:42:20,043 --> 00:42:21,143
He looks funnier.

1235
00:42:21,143 --> 00:42:23,743
- Are shorts allowed? / - Why did you wear that?

1236
00:42:23,743 --> 00:42:25,010
What's great about clubs in Boracay

1237
00:42:25,010 --> 00:42:28,076
is that you can wear whatever you like.

1238
00:42:28,076 --> 00:42:30,143
Everyone is wearing shorts and flip-flops here.

1239
00:42:30,143 --> 00:42:32,376
- It's very free. / - Yes.

1240
00:42:32,376 --> 00:42:35,943
Inside, they'll think you own the club.

1241
00:42:35,943 --> 00:42:38,410
- He's over-dressed. / - The club owner.

1242
00:42:38,410 --> 00:42:40,010
You need to wear a jacket.

1243
00:42:40,010 --> 00:42:42,543
- Boracay. / - This is so good.

1244
00:42:42,543 --> 00:42:44,310
It's been a while since we introduced a club.

1245
00:42:44,310 --> 00:42:48,043
(Club "G" is a new hot place for nightlife in Boracay)

1246
00:42:49,643 --> 00:42:52,676
It's a bit similar to old-fashioned night clubs in Korea.

1247
00:42:52,676 --> 00:42:55,243
- There are tables as well. / - Tables lined up.

1248
00:42:55,243 --> 00:42:56,576
- There are booths as well. / - You're right.

1249
00:42:56,576 --> 00:42:57,976
That's so us.

1250
00:42:57,976 --> 00:43:01,110
And you can dress in shorts and flip-flops.

1251
00:43:01,110 --> 00:43:02,443
That's fascinating.

1252
00:43:02,776 --> 00:43:05,210
- This place is newly opened. / - Really?

1253
00:43:05,210 --> 00:43:08,076
Not many know there's such a big club in Boracay.

1254
00:43:08,610 --> 00:43:09,376
It's so big.

1255
00:43:09,376 --> 00:43:12,076
- There's an entrance fee. / - That's the entrance fee.

1256
00:43:12,076 --> 00:43:15,210
- Let's order. / - Yes, let's order.

1257
00:43:15,210 --> 00:43:16,610
For me...

1258
00:43:17,276 --> 00:43:18,410
San Miguel.

1259
00:43:18,943 --> 00:43:22,576
This is a new club that's popular in Boracay.

1260
00:43:23,010 --> 00:43:24,376
It opened not too long ago.

1261
00:43:25,843 --> 00:43:28,510
Hey, it's "Run To You."

1262
00:43:30,210 --> 00:43:31,376
Let's step out.

1263
00:43:31,810 --> 00:43:34,276
Wait. Jihye, you said you'd leave after saying hi.

1264
00:43:34,276 --> 00:43:35,310
Oh, dear.

1265
00:43:35,310 --> 00:43:38,210
- You said you wouldn't stay. / - Here she comes.

1266
00:43:38,210 --> 00:43:41,210
- Here's the conservative girl. / - Conservative.

1267
00:43:41,676 --> 00:43:44,410
The Boracay tropical fish is here.

1268
00:43:44,943 --> 00:43:45,943
Oh, dear.

1269
00:43:45,943 --> 00:43:47,610
It's a function.

1270
00:43:49,376 --> 00:43:50,876
You're too conservative.

1271
00:43:50,876 --> 00:43:53,976
(Filipino style)

1272
00:43:54,610 --> 00:43:57,943
(He repeats the same dance moves)

1273
00:43:58,843 --> 00:44:02,176
(Boom takes over the stage)

1274
00:44:02,743 --> 00:44:05,676
(Shake it, Boom)

1275
00:44:06,676 --> 00:44:08,110
He's going off.

1276
00:44:08,110 --> 00:44:10,510
What will we do about him?

1277
00:44:11,276 --> 00:44:12,710
Oh, dear.

1278
00:44:14,043 --> 00:44:16,643
They'll think that every Korean is like him.

1279
00:44:16,643 --> 00:44:19,343
We've never seen anything like this on Battle Trip.

1280
00:44:19,843 --> 00:44:21,876
I became friends with the locals right away.

1281
00:44:23,843 --> 00:44:24,943
He still got it.

1282
00:44:25,576 --> 00:44:27,176
This is Boracay.

1283
00:44:27,176 --> 00:44:28,410
I can't believe we're sober.

1284
00:44:28,410 --> 00:44:30,710
- This is Boracay. / - We went when it was empty.

1285
00:44:31,176 --> 00:44:32,643
That's so funny.

1286
00:44:34,176 --> 00:44:36,310
I feel like all my stress is melting.

1287
00:44:37,576 --> 00:44:38,510
So funny.

1288
00:44:38,976 --> 00:44:41,410
- But Boom doesn't drink. / - I can't drink either.

1289
00:44:41,410 --> 00:44:42,543
Boom can't drink.

1290
00:44:45,010 --> 00:44:49,076
(I can't stay down here like this)

1291
00:44:50,310 --> 00:44:53,543
(The night in Boracay begins now)

1292
00:44:53,543 --> 00:44:55,710
I made him go up

1293
00:44:55,710 --> 00:44:57,176
to liven up the mood.

1294
00:44:59,343 --> 00:45:00,876
RaBoom.

1295
00:45:00,876 --> 00:45:02,010
Boom and Bang.

1296
00:45:02,010 --> 00:45:03,510
- RaBoom is good. / - Boom and Bang.

1297
00:45:05,576 --> 00:45:08,043
(People respond to Boom and Bang's music)

1298
00:45:09,076 --> 00:45:13,110
(The stage starts to fill up)

1299
00:45:13,543 --> 00:45:16,076
(Jihye also goes up on the stage)

1300
00:45:20,010 --> 00:45:23,976
(I'll take care of the night in Boracay)

1301
00:45:26,043 --> 00:45:28,243
Hello!

1302
00:45:29,210 --> 00:45:30,576
- She's so conservative. / - So polite.

1303
00:45:30,576 --> 00:45:31,943
- She's way too conservative. / - So polite.

1304
00:45:31,943 --> 00:45:33,010
What's with the greeting?

1305
00:45:33,010 --> 00:45:36,710
She did say that she'd say hello and leave.

1306
00:45:36,710 --> 00:45:38,376
Why did you say hello like this?

1307
00:45:42,743 --> 00:45:44,310
He looks so cool.

1308
00:45:46,043 --> 00:45:49,310
(Let's dance like crazy)

1309
00:45:53,176 --> 00:45:57,610
(They would've regretted it if they didn't come here)

1310
00:45:59,910 --> 00:46:01,576
Are they a new group?

1311
00:46:02,543 --> 00:46:04,010
We seem like KOYOTE.

1312
00:46:04,010 --> 00:46:05,376
KOYOTE.

1313
00:46:07,643 --> 00:46:10,043
- They won't be able to get up tomorrow. / - I know.

1314
00:46:12,210 --> 00:46:14,043
You did so well.

1315
00:46:16,376 --> 00:46:18,643
(The sky is clear the next morning)

1316
00:46:18,643 --> 00:46:20,176
The course I've prepared

1317
00:46:20,176 --> 00:46:22,843
has many things that Koreans don't know about.

1318
00:46:22,843 --> 00:46:24,110
- I love that. / - We love things like this.

1319
00:46:24,110 --> 00:46:26,343
Koreans come here and only stay on the island.

1320
00:46:26,343 --> 00:46:28,376
But we'll take a boat and go outside of it.

1321
00:46:28,376 --> 00:46:30,310
I love the idea of going outside of the island.

1322
00:46:30,943 --> 00:46:32,910
That was awesome.

1323
00:46:32,910 --> 00:46:34,443
It's like rafting.

1324
00:46:34,443 --> 00:46:37,743
You flow down the river.

1325
00:46:37,743 --> 00:46:40,076
The water is clean enough to drink.

1326
00:46:40,076 --> 00:46:41,576
- I drank some. / - For real?

1327
00:46:41,576 --> 00:46:43,510
For real.

1328
00:46:48,676 --> 00:46:49,543
Nature.

1329
00:46:50,010 --> 00:46:52,376
Don't you feel phytoncide just by looking at it?

1330
00:46:53,076 --> 00:46:54,376
It's too short.

1331
00:46:54,776 --> 00:46:56,043
That's really good.

1332
00:46:56,043 --> 00:46:58,110
- I love this place. / - Diving.

1333
00:46:58,110 --> 00:47:01,143
(Around $98 for the Malumpati tour)

1334
00:47:01,143 --> 00:47:03,376
We're the first to broadcast the Blue Lagoon

1335
00:47:03,376 --> 00:47:05,876
of Boracay on TV.

1336
00:47:05,876 --> 00:47:07,143
Boracay's Blue Lagoon?

1337
00:47:07,143 --> 00:47:09,243
It's probably the first time anyone's seen it.

1338
00:47:09,243 --> 00:47:13,343
This one's bigger than the one in Laos.

1339
00:47:14,110 --> 00:47:15,476
It's something we didn't know about.

1340
00:47:15,476 --> 00:47:18,610
This is the hottest place right now.

1341
00:47:18,610 --> 00:47:20,910
If you look from here, it's just water.

1342
00:47:20,910 --> 00:47:22,743
But it's blue in the deep areas.

1343
00:47:22,743 --> 00:47:24,010
It's really deep.

1344
00:47:24,010 --> 00:47:26,810
This place has never been on TV.

1345
00:47:27,476 --> 00:47:29,343
I recommend this place because...

1346
00:47:31,210 --> 00:47:32,076
I thought you were conservative.

1347
00:47:32,076 --> 00:47:34,810
I didn't know.

1348
00:47:34,810 --> 00:47:37,010
I was just told it was a swimming pool.

1349
00:47:37,010 --> 00:47:38,576
I recommend it because...

1350
00:47:38,576 --> 00:47:39,210
It's nature.

1351
00:47:39,210 --> 00:47:43,843
In Boracay, the way to the airport...

1352
00:47:43,843 --> 00:47:46,410
Most of the flights returning to Korea are at night.

1353
00:47:46,410 --> 00:47:48,376
You're right. It's at 1 a.m.

1354
00:47:48,376 --> 00:47:49,610
There's nothing to do on the way.

1355
00:47:49,610 --> 00:47:52,010
This is on the way to Kalibo Airport.

1356
00:47:53,010 --> 00:47:54,610
- You should stop by. / - Yes, you should.

1357
00:47:54,610 --> 00:47:56,543
When you go to a water park...

1358
00:47:56,543 --> 00:47:58,943
- You go around in a tube. / - Right.

1359
00:47:58,943 --> 00:48:01,743
Here, you're floating down the river

1360
00:48:01,743 --> 00:48:03,643
with a guide's escort.

1361
00:48:03,643 --> 00:48:05,876
Just a little bit of man-power.

1362
00:48:05,876 --> 00:48:08,010
By hand. With human power.

1363
00:48:08,010 --> 00:48:10,876
There is a cave up there.

1364
00:48:10,876 --> 00:48:12,510
It's about 40m deep.

1365
00:48:13,310 --> 00:48:15,343
This is amazing. This is nature.

1366
00:48:15,343 --> 00:48:16,443
Goodness.

1367
00:48:19,176 --> 00:48:20,376
Gosh, look at the sky.

1368
00:48:23,810 --> 00:48:25,543
How much longer do we need to walk?

1369
00:48:25,543 --> 00:48:28,410
- 20 more minutes. / - Really?

1370
00:48:28,410 --> 00:48:31,376
All of a sudden, I was hiking in a swimsuit.

1371
00:48:31,376 --> 00:48:33,043
- That became your hiking clothes. / - I know.

1372
00:48:33,043 --> 00:48:34,043
You have to climb the mountain?

1373
00:48:34,043 --> 00:48:36,443
- Look here. / - Don't film me.

1374
00:48:37,043 --> 00:48:38,543
It's the jungle.

1375
00:48:39,543 --> 00:48:41,510
What is that?

1376
00:48:41,510 --> 00:48:43,743
- Please apologize to the viewers. / - I'm sorry.

1377
00:48:44,210 --> 00:48:46,310
How can you make us laugh with this?

1378
00:48:46,310 --> 00:48:47,110
I'm sorry.

1379
00:48:47,610 --> 00:48:50,143
(1990s Miss Korea's swimsuit style)

1380
00:48:50,143 --> 00:48:53,043
I would've brought my pants if I knew about the hike.

1381
00:48:53,043 --> 00:48:56,210
Everyone, start recording with your own cameras.

1382
00:48:56,210 --> 00:48:57,843
Let's do that.

1383
00:48:57,843 --> 00:48:58,776
Make sure you pack your pants.

1384
00:48:58,776 --> 00:49:01,210
The most important thing to remember is no bikini.

1385
00:49:01,210 --> 00:49:04,710
Wearing a bikini might look too over the top.

1386
00:49:06,110 --> 00:49:08,876
We'll talk about bracken today.

1387
00:49:09,776 --> 00:49:12,343
Alright. Bracken fern.

1388
00:49:12,776 --> 00:49:14,910
You can see it here.

1389
00:49:14,910 --> 00:49:15,610
Bracken.

1390
00:49:16,910 --> 00:49:24,143
(Ryan Bang's Pinoy News)

1391
00:49:24,143 --> 00:49:24,843
They're coming.

1392
00:49:24,843 --> 00:49:26,843
I'll tell you about the rafting later.

1393
00:49:26,843 --> 00:49:27,943
- Bye. / - They're coming.

1394
00:49:27,943 --> 00:49:29,676
- Viewers, right now... / - Hello.

1395
00:49:30,543 --> 00:49:34,043
- They're coming right now. / - The rafting has begun.

1396
00:49:34,743 --> 00:49:37,443
- 1st place. / - Many are coming in together...

1397
00:49:38,610 --> 00:49:40,543
That looks like fun.

1398
00:49:45,510 --> 00:49:47,443
We'll go down the river like them.

1399
00:49:47,443 --> 00:49:49,110
- Is that it? / - That looks like fun.

1400
00:49:49,910 --> 00:49:52,910
(You wear a life vest and receive safety training)

1401
00:49:53,943 --> 00:49:55,076
Unbelievable.

1402
00:49:55,876 --> 00:49:58,243
Right here. It's 40m deep here.

1403
00:49:58,243 --> 00:49:58,876
Really?

1404
00:49:58,876 --> 00:50:00,876
This is where the water starts.

1405
00:50:00,876 --> 00:50:02,210
This is cool. Awesome.

1406
00:50:02,776 --> 00:50:04,676
You'll be surprised.

1407
00:50:04,676 --> 00:50:06,243
This is where the water starts.

1408
00:50:06,243 --> 00:50:09,343
This is so...

1409
00:50:09,343 --> 00:50:11,343
- It's so unbelievably clean. / - Amazing.

1410
00:50:11,343 --> 00:50:13,943
You can just drink it.

1411
00:50:13,943 --> 00:50:15,143
Look at the fish.

1412
00:50:16,943 --> 00:50:19,410
You can drink this water.

1413
00:50:19,410 --> 00:50:21,576
It's the second cleanest water in the world.

1414
00:50:22,143 --> 00:50:24,343
(Boom tastes the water)

1415
00:50:27,676 --> 00:50:28,776
How is it?

1416
00:50:29,143 --> 00:50:32,110
It doesn't smell at all.

1417
00:50:32,110 --> 00:50:34,576
It's pure water.

1418
00:50:34,576 --> 00:50:36,843
It doesn't smell at all.

1419
00:50:36,843 --> 00:50:38,243
It's clean like spring water.

1420
00:50:38,243 --> 00:50:40,376
Freshwater can smell.

1421
00:50:40,376 --> 00:50:41,910
But that has no smell.

1422
00:50:41,910 --> 00:50:43,876
This is completely natural.

1423
00:50:43,876 --> 00:50:45,610
- Look at the color. / - It's so beautiful.

1424
00:50:45,610 --> 00:50:48,110
- It's like paint. / - People can't go in there.

1425
00:50:48,110 --> 00:50:49,910
They drink water from there

1426
00:50:49,910 --> 00:50:51,043
and move downward.

1427
00:50:51,043 --> 00:50:52,843
People just drink from it

1428
00:50:52,843 --> 00:50:55,010
and move down.

1429
00:50:58,443 --> 00:51:00,476
- Is it cold? / - Wait a minute.

1430
00:51:01,843 --> 00:51:04,110
Oh, it's too cold.

1431
00:51:04,110 --> 00:51:06,043
- It's too cold. / - It's too cold?

1432
00:51:06,043 --> 00:51:08,143
- You go second. / - Slowly please.

1433
00:51:08,143 --> 00:51:10,076
I'll be startled if it's too cold.

1434
00:51:10,076 --> 00:51:11,843
- I have a weak heart. / - Water tastes like water.

1435
00:51:11,843 --> 00:51:14,676
- You're in. / - Wait.

1436
00:51:14,676 --> 00:51:16,610
Oh, it's cold.

1437
00:51:16,610 --> 00:51:18,710
I think it's the same as the hotel water.

1438
00:51:21,143 --> 00:51:23,210
(He's overreacting)

1439
00:51:23,210 --> 00:51:24,610
Wait.

1440
00:51:25,310 --> 00:51:27,210
- That looks like fun. / - It is fun.

1441
00:51:27,210 --> 00:51:30,876
The tube has a cross on it, so you don't fall through.

1442
00:51:32,076 --> 00:51:34,410
Each person has a guide.

1443
00:51:39,110 --> 00:51:40,610
That looks like so much fun.

1444
00:51:40,610 --> 00:51:41,776
It was really great.

1445
00:51:41,776 --> 00:51:42,810
In that clean water.

1446
00:51:42,810 --> 00:51:46,010
It was like going back to our childhoods.

1447
00:51:46,010 --> 00:51:48,643
Experiencing nature has its own charm.

1448
00:51:48,643 --> 00:51:50,676
You just have to float.

1449
00:51:50,676 --> 00:51:52,276
- You just relax. / - So nice.

1450
00:51:53,043 --> 00:51:53,943
I love it.

1451
00:51:55,076 --> 00:51:58,010
- Your guide escorts you... / - So it's safe.

1452
00:51:58,010 --> 00:51:59,343
To keep you safe.

1453
00:51:59,343 --> 00:52:01,510
I really want to try that.

1454
00:52:06,010 --> 00:52:08,643
(Screaming)

1455
00:52:10,176 --> 00:52:13,376
- That looks so fun. / - I love that.

1456
00:52:13,376 --> 00:52:15,243
It's nice because it's not too rough.

1457
00:52:20,143 --> 00:52:23,410
(The water flows more rapidly as they go down)

1458
00:52:25,410 --> 00:52:26,710
It's getting rough now.

1459
00:52:27,876 --> 00:52:29,376
You go in and out.

1460
00:52:30,810 --> 00:52:34,043
Since you can drink that water.

1461
00:52:36,410 --> 00:52:38,543
- Gosh, this is nice. / - It's really nice.

1462
00:52:38,543 --> 00:52:39,710
- Ryan. / - Yes?

1463
00:52:39,710 --> 00:52:42,143
Thank you. Thank you so much.

1464
00:52:42,143 --> 00:52:44,143
- Isn't this great? / - Totally.

1465
00:52:44,143 --> 00:52:46,276
- This place is the best. / - I love outdoor activities.

1466
00:52:46,276 --> 00:52:46,943
It looks so good.

1467
00:52:46,943 --> 00:52:48,943
You have to check this place out.

1468
00:52:48,943 --> 00:52:50,710
- It's not very well known yet. / - I should go there.

1469
00:52:50,710 --> 00:52:52,210
- Yes. / - Look at the water.

1470
00:52:54,676 --> 00:52:56,876
That's nature in its original form.

1471
00:53:02,043 --> 00:53:04,343
- This is like a pool. / - That's paradise.

1472
00:53:04,343 --> 00:53:06,876
A lot of people came with kids.

1473
00:53:06,876 --> 00:53:08,743
There were many local families.

1474
00:53:09,976 --> 00:53:12,943
- You could sleep there. / - Right.

1475
00:53:12,943 --> 00:53:16,010
- They have hotels, right? / - It's near the airport.

1476
00:53:20,810 --> 00:53:22,343
Ryan Bang!

1477
00:53:27,910 --> 00:53:29,176
It's so high.

1478
00:53:29,176 --> 00:53:31,076
Didn't Ryan say he's scared of heights?

1479
00:53:31,076 --> 00:53:33,510
He was so scared

1480
00:53:33,510 --> 00:53:35,276
but there are so many people cheering for him.

1481
00:53:36,176 --> 00:53:38,976
- It's so high. / - It's about 7m high.

1482
00:53:38,976 --> 00:53:40,176
You can do it.

1483
00:53:41,410 --> 00:53:44,010
(An official cheering squad for Ryan)

1484
00:53:53,476 --> 00:53:54,810
(Hang on a second)

1485
00:53:55,776 --> 00:53:57,476
(He gives up)

1486
00:53:57,476 --> 00:53:59,576
Ryan is scared of heights.

1487
00:53:59,576 --> 00:54:01,676
So instead of him, I...

1488
00:54:01,676 --> 00:54:03,310
So Ryan didn't jump?

1489
00:54:03,310 --> 00:54:04,843
- You're a man. / - He tries again later.

1490
00:54:04,843 --> 00:54:07,276
- Gosh, Jihye. It's so high up here. / - Boom first.

1491
00:54:07,976 --> 00:54:10,476
I worry about my safety a lot.

1492
00:54:11,110 --> 00:54:13,410
I'm very sensitive when it comes to safety.

1493
00:54:13,410 --> 00:54:16,476
I try to be as safe as possible.

1494
00:54:16,476 --> 00:54:18,210
That's how I travel.

1495
00:54:18,210 --> 00:54:21,810
I can go up 5 to 7m.

1496
00:54:21,810 --> 00:54:23,610
Hey, that's like only this high.

1497
00:54:24,176 --> 00:54:27,043
5m is meaningless.

1498
00:54:27,876 --> 00:54:30,443
(That's why this is 4m)

1499
00:54:30,443 --> 00:54:32,976
- Is it 4m? / - It's only 4m.

1500
00:54:32,976 --> 00:54:35,210
(Gosh, I don't think I can do this)

1501
00:54:38,010 --> 00:54:39,376
No, no, no. You'll get hurt.

1502
00:54:39,376 --> 00:54:39,910
What?

1503
00:54:43,243 --> 00:54:44,676
We can't do that.

1504
00:54:46,376 --> 00:54:48,143
We can't do that.

1505
00:54:48,543 --> 00:54:49,610
I was so shocked.

1506
00:54:50,743 --> 00:54:53,843
I heard it's incredibly deep

1507
00:54:53,843 --> 00:54:55,243
under the water.

1508
00:54:55,243 --> 00:54:57,010
I heard it's deeper than 50m.

1509
00:54:57,010 --> 00:54:58,510
That's scary.

1510
00:54:58,510 --> 00:55:01,576
(Please cheer for me)

1511
00:55:04,310 --> 00:55:09,310
(He jumped)

1512
00:55:11,810 --> 00:55:14,976
(He plucked up courage to fight the fear in himself)

1513
00:55:14,976 --> 00:55:17,143
(Great job)

1514
00:55:17,743 --> 00:55:19,143
Good job, Lee Minho.

1515
00:55:19,943 --> 00:55:21,943
Good job. You looked really cool.

1516
00:55:23,910 --> 00:55:25,943
(I was so cool)

1517
00:55:30,076 --> 00:55:33,210
(Ryan gives it another try)

1518
00:55:33,210 --> 00:55:35,010
Ryan retries.

1519
00:55:36,743 --> 00:55:39,376
- Jump! / - Everyone there cheered for him.

1520
00:55:41,910 --> 00:55:44,010
It doesn't look so scary from here

1521
00:55:44,010 --> 00:55:46,343
but it was so scary there.

1522
00:55:46,343 --> 00:55:47,910
It's a frightening height.

1523
00:55:47,910 --> 00:55:50,243
- Once you do it, you feel good. / - It's like this.

1524
00:55:50,243 --> 00:55:53,576
The water was so deep, it was scary to go in.

1525
00:55:53,576 --> 00:55:54,643
You can't see the bottom.

1526
00:55:54,643 --> 00:55:57,243
- Seriously... / - It's way deeper than the ocean.

1527
00:55:58,776 --> 00:56:01,276
It was so scary. You're really cool.

1528
00:56:01,276 --> 00:56:03,176
It was scary, right?

1529
00:56:03,176 --> 00:56:05,710
I could only do it because you went first.

1530
00:56:05,710 --> 00:56:07,410
After doing this, I feel like,

1531
00:56:07,410 --> 00:56:08,576
I can do everything.

1532
00:56:08,576 --> 00:56:10,410
- I feel confident. / - Go again?

1533
00:56:10,410 --> 00:56:11,876
- No, no. / - No?

1534
00:56:11,876 --> 00:56:14,376
- You guys must be hungry by now. / - I'm hungry.

1535
00:56:15,043 --> 00:56:18,076
Since we're hungry... Do you guys like buffet?

1536
00:56:18,076 --> 00:56:18,876
Buffet.

1537
00:56:18,876 --> 00:56:20,010
- I love it. / - Let's go.

1538
00:56:20,010 --> 00:56:21,743
- Buffet time. / - Let's go.

1539
00:56:24,143 --> 00:56:25,643
(2nd day of RaBang Tour)

1540
00:56:25,643 --> 00:56:25,943
(Local buffet)

1541
00:56:25,943 --> 00:56:28,143
We were hungry so we went to eat again.

1542
00:56:29,676 --> 00:56:30,976
Not many Korean people know about

1543
00:56:30,976 --> 00:56:32,243
boodle fight.

1544
00:56:32,943 --> 00:56:35,276
Here you can experience the traditional way

1545
00:56:35,276 --> 00:56:37,110
of eating with your hands here.

1546
00:56:37,110 --> 00:56:38,710
- They eat with their hands? / - Traditionally.

1547
00:56:38,710 --> 00:56:40,410
Eating with your hands.

1548
00:56:40,410 --> 00:56:42,010
It's very delicious.

1549
00:56:42,010 --> 00:56:43,143
It's my favorite dish here.

1550
00:56:44,276 --> 00:56:45,443
You must be hungry.

1551
00:56:45,443 --> 00:56:47,710
I could eat anything right now.

1552
00:56:47,710 --> 00:56:49,810
- I'm starving. / - Swimming makes you hungry.

1553
00:56:49,810 --> 00:56:52,076
I prepared food for you.

1554
00:56:52,076 --> 00:56:54,676
It's a fancy buffet.

1555
00:56:54,676 --> 00:56:55,976
- Really? / - Yes.

1556
00:56:55,976 --> 00:56:58,410
- Like a welcome ceremony. / - Since it's a valley...

1557
00:56:58,410 --> 00:57:00,510
- I feel like boiled chicken. / - Here?

1558
00:57:00,510 --> 00:57:02,243
Can you see the buffet?

1559
00:57:02,243 --> 00:57:03,210
What is that?

1560
00:57:03,210 --> 00:57:05,576
- That's the buffet I prepared. / - Really?

1561
00:57:05,576 --> 00:57:06,910
- What is this? / - We can eat this?

1562
00:57:06,910 --> 00:57:08,676
- This is called boodle fight. / - This is amazing.

1563
00:57:08,676 --> 00:57:10,376
Boodle fight.

1564
00:57:10,376 --> 00:57:13,643
This is the way soldiers used to eat.

1565
00:57:13,643 --> 00:57:15,276
- The weather was great. / - They'd remove their ranks.

1566
00:57:15,276 --> 00:57:17,643
- What is this? / - And enjoy food together as equals.

1567
00:57:17,643 --> 00:57:20,476
That's where boodle fight originated from.

1568
00:57:20,476 --> 00:57:23,343
This is how Filipinos eat with their families and relatives

1569
00:57:23,343 --> 00:57:25,410
on family holidays like

1570
00:57:25,410 --> 00:57:27,176
Chuseok or Seollal in Korea.

1571
00:57:27,176 --> 00:57:29,010
They set the food like this

1572
00:57:29,010 --> 00:57:30,276
and eat together with their hands.

1573
00:57:30,276 --> 00:57:31,776
There's chicken as well?

1574
00:57:31,776 --> 00:57:33,343
- It's a variety of flavors. / - Yes.

1575
00:57:33,343 --> 00:57:34,443
- It looks good. / - There's pork too.

1576
00:57:34,443 --> 00:57:36,610
Everyone stands around the table and

1577
00:57:36,610 --> 00:57:38,310
eats the food with their hands.

1578
00:57:38,310 --> 00:57:40,010
It's a Filipino buffet.

1579
00:57:40,010 --> 00:57:42,010
You wash with the calamansi like this.

1580
00:57:42,010 --> 00:57:44,610
- I've never used calamansi as soap before. / - Yes.

1581
00:57:44,610 --> 00:57:46,143
This is a natural soap...

1582
00:57:46,143 --> 00:57:48,610
- Since it's acidic. / - Exactly. It's a disinfectant.

1583
00:57:48,610 --> 00:57:49,810
I'm nervous.

1584
00:57:49,810 --> 00:57:52,010
Grab some rice like this...

1585
00:57:52,010 --> 00:57:53,976
And put some meat on the rice.

1586
00:57:53,976 --> 00:57:57,876
Jihye, this is the culture of this region.

1587
00:57:57,876 --> 00:57:59,410
I think it's a good idea to experience

1588
00:57:59,410 --> 00:58:01,376
how locals eat here.

1589
00:58:01,376 --> 00:58:03,843
It was strange for me because it was my first time.

1590
00:58:03,843 --> 00:58:04,243
Goodness.

1591
00:58:04,243 --> 00:58:06,876
It was hard to try in the beginning.

1592
00:58:06,876 --> 00:58:09,310
But once you try, it's delicious to eat with your hands.

1593
00:58:09,310 --> 00:58:10,443
It's very tender.

1594
00:58:11,876 --> 00:58:12,476
It's good, right?

1595
00:58:12,476 --> 00:58:13,743
I've been to the Philippines many times

1596
00:58:13,743 --> 00:58:15,543
but I've never seen something like this.

1597
00:58:15,543 --> 00:58:17,676
- This is similar to... / - It looks delicious.

1598
00:58:17,676 --> 00:58:19,376
- Pork ribs in Korea. / - I love pork ribs.

1599
00:58:19,376 --> 00:58:20,976
It tastes like ribs.

1600
00:58:20,976 --> 00:58:22,843
I think I will miss this food back in Seoul.

1601
00:58:22,843 --> 00:58:24,210
- Really? / - I'm sure I'll miss this.

1602
00:58:24,210 --> 00:58:27,043
If you like the food after a bite, go like this...

1603
00:58:27,543 --> 00:58:28,710
And then do this.

1604
00:58:30,543 --> 00:58:32,343
Send your mom a heart to tell her it's good.

1605
00:58:32,343 --> 00:58:36,110
This is the traditional Filipino noodle, pancit canton.

1606
00:58:36,110 --> 00:58:37,976
- You eat that with hands too? / - This is delicious.

1607
00:58:37,976 --> 00:58:40,276
- The noodle was delicious. / - I like the noodles.

1608
00:58:42,310 --> 00:58:43,843
You're good with chopsticks.

1609
00:58:43,843 --> 00:58:45,210
I can eat it like this.

1610
00:58:48,110 --> 00:58:49,310
Seriously...

1611
00:58:49,910 --> 00:58:51,143
We all have this.

1612
00:58:51,143 --> 00:58:53,443
- This is comfortable. / - This is good for noodles.

1613
00:58:53,443 --> 00:58:54,776
I think you adapt very well.

1614
00:58:54,776 --> 00:58:56,910
There's a spicy sauce next to the food.

1615
00:58:56,910 --> 00:59:00,376
It's soy sauce mixed with spicy chili peppers.

1616
00:59:00,376 --> 00:59:02,410
If you eat it with the chili pepper and sauce,

1617
00:59:02,410 --> 00:59:04,010
it's spicy and tasty.

1618
00:59:06,176 --> 00:59:08,276
I prepared a surprise here.

1619
00:59:08,276 --> 00:59:09,876
- It's good for your health. / - Really?

1620
00:59:09,876 --> 00:59:11,276
- I prepared something. / - I love things like that.

1621
00:59:11,276 --> 00:59:12,910
Things to do with good health.

1622
00:59:12,910 --> 00:59:14,910
It felt like eating chicken next to a valley.

1623
00:59:14,910 --> 00:59:16,743
It was fun to eat with our hands.

1624
00:59:16,743 --> 00:59:18,343
- It was nice. / - Here comes the chicken.

1625
00:59:18,343 --> 00:59:20,176
- Really? / - This was amazing. It's boiled chicken.

1626
00:59:21,443 --> 00:59:23,043
- What is that? / - They add the meat whole.

1627
00:59:23,043 --> 00:59:24,343
Yes, whole.

1628
00:59:24,343 --> 00:59:25,243
It's so good.

1629
00:59:25,243 --> 00:59:26,043
Is that a pot?

1630
00:59:26,043 --> 00:59:27,643
- It's a pot. / - They add it whole.

1631
00:59:27,643 --> 00:59:29,343
How big is the dish?

1632
00:59:29,343 --> 00:59:31,710
It was big enough to feed all the staff.

1633
00:59:32,210 --> 00:59:35,076
They're cooking something similar boiled chicken.

1634
00:59:35,076 --> 00:59:36,343
They added the vegetables.

1635
00:59:36,343 --> 00:59:39,010
- Is this like shabu shabu? / - Exactly.

1636
00:59:39,010 --> 00:59:40,810
They even put flowers in it. Can you eat the flowers?

1637
00:59:40,810 --> 00:59:41,810
You should go in.

1638
00:59:42,910 --> 00:59:43,776
Oh, no.

1639
00:59:43,776 --> 00:59:45,976
Whatever you imagine, this is beyond.

1640
00:59:45,976 --> 00:59:47,010
What's going on?

1641
00:59:47,510 --> 00:59:49,576
It's good for you.

1642
00:59:50,043 --> 00:59:51,110
Isn't this for cooking?

1643
00:59:51,110 --> 00:59:52,476
We're going to cook you.

1644
00:59:52,476 --> 00:59:54,076
It feels weird.

1645
00:59:55,643 --> 00:59:57,976
This is like a public bath in Korea.

1646
00:59:57,976 --> 01:00:00,043
- Not many people know about this. / - It's a bath.

1647
01:00:00,043 --> 01:00:02,976
It's so nice in here.

1648
01:00:02,976 --> 01:00:04,943
- It prevents flu. / - It smells good.

1649
01:00:04,943 --> 01:00:05,576
Yes, it does.

1650
01:00:05,576 --> 01:00:08,443
- There's lemon in it. / - Excuse me, sir.

1651
01:00:08,443 --> 01:00:10,010
Sir?

1652
01:00:10,010 --> 01:00:12,343
You can leave the fire alone.

1653
01:00:14,243 --> 01:00:15,543
Wait a minute.

1654
01:00:15,543 --> 01:00:16,876
He's heating the pot.

1655
01:00:17,776 --> 01:00:18,976
What the?

1656
01:00:20,943 --> 01:00:23,243
- For real? / - He's heating it up.

1657
01:00:24,976 --> 01:00:27,943
- Wait a minute. Is this okay? / - Amazing.

1658
01:00:27,943 --> 01:00:28,843
He's heating it up.

1659
01:00:28,843 --> 01:00:30,843
Just like a barbecue.

1660
01:00:31,343 --> 01:00:32,810
If you heat the bottom...

1661
01:00:32,810 --> 01:00:35,043
- Amazing. / - The heat fills the pot.

1662
01:00:35,043 --> 01:00:37,676
Once they're done cooking, you eat them?

1663
01:00:41,576 --> 01:00:44,476
The traditional Filipino pot spa...

1664
01:00:45,010 --> 01:00:46,410
Is very popular these days.

1665
01:00:46,410 --> 01:00:51,276
Some people come to Boracay just for this spa.

1666
01:00:51,276 --> 01:00:52,943
This is comforting.

1667
01:00:53,643 --> 01:00:55,243
- It's nice. / - This is really nice.

1668
01:00:55,243 --> 01:00:56,176
It's so good.

1669
01:00:58,110 --> 01:01:00,176
When else would you experience such a hot spring

1670
01:01:00,176 --> 01:01:02,710
here, in the mountains of Boracay.

1671
01:01:02,710 --> 01:01:03,510
The three of us...

1672
01:01:05,376 --> 01:01:08,143
But isn't Ryan's fire too strong? Sir?

1673
01:01:08,143 --> 01:01:09,443
It's so hot here.

1674
01:01:09,443 --> 01:01:10,976
- It's so hot here. / - Oh, dear.

1675
01:01:11,443 --> 01:01:13,143
He shouldn't have taken off his shirt.

1676
01:01:13,810 --> 01:01:16,843
- It's like he's being cooked. / - He took it off.

1677
01:01:16,843 --> 01:01:18,943
That isn't CG.

1678
01:01:18,943 --> 01:01:20,110
It's good for your skin too.

1679
01:01:20,543 --> 01:01:21,876
- It's really good. / - I love it.

1680
01:01:21,876 --> 01:01:25,610
It feels really nice to sit in here...

1681
01:01:25,610 --> 01:01:27,376
- Bathing in nature like this... / - This is so nice.

1682
01:01:27,376 --> 01:01:29,376
I feel like I'm one with nature.

1683
01:01:29,376 --> 01:01:31,510
It's like Gangwon-do. It's so nice.

1684
01:01:31,510 --> 01:01:32,443
It's a very unique experience.

1685
01:01:33,010 --> 01:01:35,810
(I'm one with nature)

1686
01:01:36,576 --> 01:01:37,710
He's hilarious.

1687
01:01:37,710 --> 01:01:38,843
It was so warm.

1688
01:01:39,343 --> 01:01:42,410
After this, we'll go back to Boracay.

1689
01:01:42,410 --> 01:01:45,376
It's the pork hock place with the best view in the world.

1690
01:01:45,810 --> 01:01:47,510
- A pork hock place with a view? / - With a view.

1691
01:01:48,843 --> 01:01:50,910
(See you again in Boracay)

1692
01:01:50,910 --> 01:01:52,143
This is so nice.

1693
01:01:53,910 --> 01:01:55,943
- That looks really unique. / - That was great.

1694
01:01:55,943 --> 01:01:57,343
- Eating with your hands, then that. / - So nice.

1695
01:01:57,343 --> 01:01:58,610
- It's the best. / - It looks fun.

1696
01:01:58,610 --> 01:02:00,876
In Boracay, you eat and play, eat and play.

1697
01:02:00,876 --> 01:02:02,010
Yes, yes.

1698
01:02:03,276 --> 01:02:05,976
When we first arrived here, we ate near Station 3.

1699
01:02:05,976 --> 01:02:08,110
- We're now at Station 2. / - No. 2?

1700
01:02:08,110 --> 01:02:11,210
This is the most crowded area.

1701
01:02:12,043 --> 01:02:14,876
Not many Koreans know about this place.

1702
01:02:14,876 --> 01:02:17,076
The reason why the pork hocks are so good...

1703
01:02:17,076 --> 01:02:18,976
- Because the view here is... / - Amazing.

1704
01:02:18,976 --> 01:02:20,110
It's the view of Boracay.

1705
01:02:20,676 --> 01:02:23,376
While looking at the emerald ocean and the sunset...

1706
01:02:23,876 --> 01:02:24,843
You eat pork hocks.

1707
01:02:24,843 --> 01:02:27,576
- Sunset of 5 "S." / - Let's go.

1708
01:02:27,576 --> 01:02:30,210
- Let's go and have pork hocks. / - Let's go.

1709
01:02:31,010 --> 01:02:34,243
That's about when the sun starts going down.

1710
01:02:34,243 --> 01:02:36,243
- It looks so nice. / - That's the dream life.

1711
01:02:36,243 --> 01:02:38,243
They have local Filipino dishes.

1712
01:02:38,243 --> 01:02:39,810
- We should have local dishes. / - Pork hocks...

1713
01:02:39,810 --> 01:02:42,310
I didn't know they ate pork hocks here.

1714
01:02:42,310 --> 01:02:44,010
I've never been to such a fancy pork hock place.

1715
01:02:44,010 --> 01:02:45,543
- This is like... / - I know.

1716
01:02:45,543 --> 01:02:47,876
- The setting... / - Check out the view.

1717
01:02:48,810 --> 01:02:50,410
- It's beautiful, isn't it? / - It is.

1718
01:02:50,410 --> 01:02:52,543
It looks different in the evening when

1719
01:02:52,543 --> 01:02:54,210
the boats come together.

1720
01:02:54,210 --> 01:02:55,443
It looks beautiful.

1721
01:02:55,443 --> 01:02:58,476
Many couples ride boats here

1722
01:02:58,476 --> 01:02:59,376
at this time of the day.

1723
01:02:59,376 --> 01:03:02,676
It's a view that you really want to share.

1724
01:03:02,676 --> 01:03:04,710
The sound of the waves is nice.

1725
01:03:04,710 --> 01:03:06,876
You can come here straight from the beach too.

1726
01:03:06,876 --> 01:03:08,343
Food tastes so good when you do that.

1727
01:03:08,343 --> 01:03:10,343
- It does. / - Here's another booklet.

1728
01:03:10,343 --> 01:03:12,210
- A thick booklet. / - Menu.

1729
01:03:12,210 --> 01:03:14,843
We need to order the crispy pata first,

1730
01:03:14,843 --> 01:03:16,043
the pork hocks.

1731
01:03:16,043 --> 01:03:19,043
- Crispy pata. / - It tastes good already.

1732
01:03:20,443 --> 01:03:21,710
I felt like beer again.

1733
01:03:21,710 --> 01:03:23,076
Bulalo soup.

1734
01:03:23,076 --> 01:03:24,143
Adobong pusit.

1735
01:03:24,143 --> 01:03:25,410
It's squid.

1736
01:03:25,410 --> 01:03:29,243
The Koreans living in Boracay come here for this.

1737
01:03:29,243 --> 01:03:30,410
- Let's order one of these. / -  Okay.

1738
01:03:30,410 --> 01:03:33,143
Looks so good. Crispy on the outside.

1739
01:03:33,143 --> 01:03:35,043
Of all the places I've been in Southeast Asia,

1740
01:03:35,043 --> 01:03:37,343
this place matches the Korean palate the best.

1741
01:03:37,343 --> 01:03:38,310
The squid.

1742
01:03:38,310 --> 01:03:39,476
- Here it is. / - It's here.

1743
01:03:39,476 --> 01:03:41,410
- Bulalo soup? / - Bulalo.

1744
01:03:41,410 --> 01:03:44,210
- It's a bone broth. / - Like ox bone soup?

1745
01:03:45,143 --> 01:03:46,143
(Bulalo)

1746
01:03:46,143 --> 01:03:47,910
(Made by boiling the hind leg of a cow for a long time)

1747
01:03:47,910 --> 01:03:49,510
The bulalo was amazing.

1748
01:03:50,343 --> 01:03:52,810
The soup was so rich because they boiled bones.

1749
01:03:54,210 --> 01:03:55,743
The meat was so tender.

1750
01:03:58,876 --> 01:04:01,176
- It suits our taste. / - It does?

1751
01:04:01,176 --> 01:04:03,910
Yes, it suits Koreans. It feels a bit like ox tail soup.

1752
01:04:06,576 --> 01:04:07,543
It's so good.

1753
01:04:08,076 --> 01:04:10,210
You know that clean ox tail soup?

1754
01:04:10,210 --> 01:04:12,176
- It's just like Korean food. / - You're right.

1755
01:04:12,176 --> 01:04:14,210
The beef is so tender and it suits our taste.

1756
01:04:14,210 --> 01:04:16,743
This place is amazing.

1757
01:04:16,743 --> 01:04:18,543
I'd say this has a 50-year history.

1758
01:04:18,710 --> 01:04:22,043
(Bulalo with a taste of 50-years of tradition?)

1759
01:04:22,043 --> 01:04:24,676
This dish is from...

1760
01:04:25,110 --> 01:04:26,743
The cold regions of the Philippines.

1761
01:04:26,743 --> 01:04:27,876
The people living in the colder regions...

1762
01:04:27,876 --> 01:04:30,410
- Eat this to warm up? / - Exactly.

1763
01:04:30,410 --> 01:04:32,210
So it suits Korean tastes really well.

1764
01:04:32,210 --> 01:04:34,243
I want to take this with me in a tumbler.

1765
01:04:34,243 --> 01:04:35,743
That was like short rib soup.

1766
01:04:35,743 --> 01:04:38,143
- Rib soup? / - You can slap 2 bottles of soju easy...

1767
01:04:38,143 --> 01:04:39,243
Slap what?

1768
01:04:39,243 --> 01:04:40,976
So conservative.

1769
01:04:40,976 --> 01:04:42,910
There she goes again.

1770
01:04:44,976 --> 01:04:45,643
What is this?

1771
01:04:45,643 --> 01:04:47,276
This is what Koreans like best.

1772
01:04:47,276 --> 01:04:49,476
- It's squid ink. / - That looks so good.

1773
01:04:49,476 --> 01:04:50,510
This is the pork hocks?

1774
01:04:50,510 --> 01:04:52,810
- The famous pork hocks. / - They were so good.

1775
01:04:52,810 --> 01:04:55,143
- It's fried, right? / - Yes, on the outside.

1776
01:04:55,143 --> 01:04:56,876
Inside, it has really tender pork.

1777
01:04:56,876 --> 01:04:59,343
- It's like Beijing duck. / - Yes, Beijing duck.

1778
01:04:59,343 --> 01:05:01,210
The outside is cooked crispy.

1779
01:05:01,210 --> 01:05:03,076
Do you eat it dipped in a sauce?

1780
01:05:03,443 --> 01:05:05,643
This is the sauce for crispy pata.

1781
01:05:05,643 --> 01:05:07,143
Let me tell you how to make the sauce.

1782
01:05:07,143 --> 01:05:09,110
- Put peppers in. / - You have to put spicy ones in it.

1783
01:05:09,110 --> 01:05:09,643
That looks so good.

1784
01:05:09,643 --> 01:05:11,910
- With lots of onions. / - Use your fork.

1785
01:05:11,910 --> 01:05:13,843
That's calamansi.

1786
01:05:13,843 --> 01:05:15,676
Using the fork to keep the seeds out.

1787
01:05:16,743 --> 01:05:17,876
Filipino pork hocks.

1788
01:05:18,276 --> 01:05:19,776
Filipino pork hocks.

1789
01:05:23,610 --> 01:05:24,576
It's so good!

1790
01:05:26,876 --> 01:05:27,910
Isn't it amazing?

1791
01:05:30,010 --> 01:05:31,210
This means that Jihye really likes it.

1792
01:05:31,210 --> 01:05:32,043
It was so good.

1793
01:05:32,043 --> 01:05:34,110
- It looks so good. / - I can't lie.

1794
01:05:34,110 --> 01:05:36,076
It's like meat...

1795
01:05:36,076 --> 01:05:38,643
The skin is crispy so

1796
01:05:38,643 --> 01:05:42,043
the texture in your mouth...

1797
01:05:42,043 --> 01:05:44,143
Should we buy some pork hocks and fry it?

1798
01:05:44,143 --> 01:05:46,543
It's pork hocks but tastes like boiled pork.

1799
01:05:46,543 --> 01:05:47,510
Boiled pork.

1800
01:05:47,810 --> 01:05:50,343
It's really good. I'm speechless.

1801
01:05:50,343 --> 01:05:54,143
Even old Korean people who can't eat

1802
01:05:54,143 --> 01:05:55,676
foreign foods will love this.

1803
01:05:56,610 --> 01:05:59,943
(She courageously takes a bite)

1804
01:06:00,510 --> 01:06:01,843
(Her eyes get bigger)

1805
01:06:03,343 --> 01:06:05,176
- Isn't it really good? / - Amazing.

1806
01:06:05,176 --> 01:06:06,710
When you go to Korean restaurants,

1807
01:06:06,710 --> 01:06:08,343
they have stir-fried squid.

1808
01:06:08,343 --> 01:06:09,176
It's like that.

1809
01:06:09,176 --> 01:06:11,110
You can taste the sauce more than the ink.

1810
01:06:11,110 --> 01:06:12,510
It doesn't smell fishy at all.

1811
01:06:12,510 --> 01:06:14,176
How could it taste so clean?

1812
01:06:14,176 --> 01:06:16,243
Since we like to do variety shows...

1813
01:06:16,243 --> 01:06:19,110
- When they see this. / - He's an old comedian.

1814
01:06:19,110 --> 01:06:20,143
Old comedian.

1815
01:06:20,143 --> 01:06:22,210
- You have to make this funny. / - Of course.

1816
01:06:22,210 --> 01:06:23,010
We have to get footage of us eating.

1817
01:06:23,010 --> 01:06:23,843
What should we do?

1818
01:06:23,843 --> 01:06:25,243
Let's just eat it naturally.

1819
01:06:25,243 --> 01:06:27,943
Just take a bite and give a big smile.

1820
01:06:27,943 --> 01:06:30,143
Take a big bite and give us a big smile.

1821
01:06:31,343 --> 01:06:32,710
(Expectant)

1822
01:06:32,710 --> 01:06:33,610
It's so good.

1823
01:06:33,610 --> 01:06:36,143
(Ta-da)

1824
01:06:37,210 --> 01:06:38,343
He has to do it.

1825
01:06:38,343 --> 01:06:41,510
You're so ugly. What are you going to do?

1826
01:06:41,510 --> 01:06:42,143
You should also try it.

1827
01:06:46,710 --> 01:06:48,576
She did well.

1828
01:06:50,276 --> 01:06:52,043
This is how they really do it in the Philippines.

1829
01:06:52,043 --> 01:06:54,210
My emotions really welled up earlier...

1830
01:06:57,643 --> 01:07:00,310
(The reason why everyone exclaimed)

1831
01:07:02,010 --> 01:07:05,243
(You can see Boracay's sunset as time goes by)

1832
01:07:06,043 --> 01:07:09,443
- It looks like a calendar. / - That's another "S."

1833
01:07:10,510 --> 01:07:11,976
This is amazing.

1834
01:07:15,343 --> 01:07:17,343
It really is one of the 5 "S," sunset.

1835
01:07:18,176 --> 01:07:19,076
Isn't it really pretty?

1836
01:07:20,376 --> 01:07:22,343
You have to acknowledge that's a beautiful sunset.

1837
01:07:22,343 --> 01:07:23,443
We have no choice.

1838
01:07:24,110 --> 01:07:25,910
- It was like art. / - It's really pretty.

1839
01:07:25,910 --> 01:07:27,643
- It was an unforgettable scene. / - The clouds...

1840
01:07:27,643 --> 01:07:29,610
I feel like we're saying good-bye

1841
01:07:29,610 --> 01:07:31,210
to the sunset at this moment.

1842
01:07:31,210 --> 01:07:33,610
I feel emotional.

1843
01:07:34,110 --> 01:07:36,276
- Isn't the Philippines beautiful? / - It's so beautiful.

1844
01:07:36,276 --> 01:07:39,076
The Filipinos also acknowledge that Boracay has

1845
01:07:39,076 --> 01:07:41,710
one of the most beautiful sunsets.

1846
01:07:42,276 --> 01:07:44,376
Some people come here to visit and don't go back.

1847
01:07:44,376 --> 01:07:45,510
- Because it's so nice. / - Because they like it.

1848
01:07:45,510 --> 01:07:49,010
- The view, experience, it's perfect. / - I know.

1849
01:07:50,576 --> 01:07:52,343
We'd better do this when he comes to Korea.

1850
01:07:52,343 --> 01:07:55,110
Yes, the next time RyBang comes to Korea...

1851
01:07:55,110 --> 01:07:58,376
- He's not RyBang. / - Ryan Bang.

1852
01:07:58,376 --> 01:08:01,243
- Not RyBang. / - That's not right.

1853
01:08:01,243 --> 01:08:04,543
- Sorry, I meant Ryan Bang. / - Geez, Jihye...

1854
01:08:04,543 --> 01:08:08,276
(Beach bar)

1855
01:08:08,710 --> 01:08:14,210
(8 minutes to the beach bar from the restaurant)

1856
01:08:15,776 --> 01:08:18,176
You hear music the entire walk.

1857
01:08:19,743 --> 01:08:22,376
You can just sit on the beach.

1858
01:08:22,376 --> 01:08:24,443
- You can drink on the beach? / - This is Boracay.

1859
01:08:25,710 --> 01:08:27,310
It feels so good here. Singing songs...

1860
01:08:27,310 --> 01:08:29,076
They have live performances too.

1861
01:08:29,076 --> 01:08:33,810
There are a lot of clubs on the sand beach.

1862
01:08:33,810 --> 01:08:36,976
Let's enjoy this while drinking cocktails.

1863
01:08:36,976 --> 01:08:38,543
- Isn't it so nice? / - It is.

1864
01:08:39,810 --> 01:08:41,210
This is the sea breeze.

1865
01:08:41,976 --> 01:08:45,443
Boracay has two different charms by day and night.

1866
01:08:45,443 --> 01:08:48,476
- Three steps forward and it's the ocean. / - Ocean.

1867
01:08:49,076 --> 01:08:52,610
- Three steps back and there are clubs. / - So good.

1868
01:08:52,610 --> 01:08:54,976
Which "S" is this then?

1869
01:08:54,976 --> 01:08:59,410
- Of the 5 "S," this is star. / - Star.

1870
01:08:59,410 --> 01:09:01,043
- Star. / - Star.

1871
01:09:02,243 --> 01:09:02,910
For real?

1872
01:09:02,910 --> 01:09:05,743
The sky was so clear.

1873
01:09:05,743 --> 01:09:09,176
(Drinking cocktails on the beach under the stars)

1874
01:09:09,176 --> 01:09:11,543
- You have to go there with your lover. / - Yes.

1875
01:09:14,476 --> 01:09:16,110
Pizza! Thank you.

1876
01:09:16,110 --> 01:09:18,043
This place is famous

1877
01:09:18,043 --> 01:09:20,910
for having pizza with cocktails.

1878
01:09:20,910 --> 01:09:22,976
- Do you eat it with the cocktails? / - Yes, together.

1879
01:09:22,976 --> 01:09:23,776
I love it.

1880
01:09:24,676 --> 01:09:25,710
- Let's eat it. / - Let's eat it.

1881
01:09:27,243 --> 01:09:29,310
It's delicious to eat pizza with the cocktails.

1882
01:09:30,076 --> 01:09:35,310
(They try pizza with cocktails as Ryan recommended)

1883
01:09:35,876 --> 01:09:36,843
Isn't it so delicious?

1884
01:09:36,843 --> 01:09:38,976
- Don't they go well together? / - Yes.

1885
01:09:38,976 --> 01:09:40,476
- It goes so well with the cocktails. / - Right?

1886
01:09:40,476 --> 01:09:42,710
- It's pizza. / - The owner is a European.

1887
01:09:42,710 --> 01:09:45,376
He's an Italian and he makes pizza here.

1888
01:09:45,376 --> 01:09:46,843
- It's so good. / - Italy...

1889
01:09:47,643 --> 01:09:51,976
(Boom kept eating and drinking since it was so good)

1890
01:09:53,843 --> 01:09:54,810
He's drunk.

1891
01:09:56,043 --> 01:09:57,076
He's a terrible drinker.

1892
01:09:57,710 --> 01:09:58,443
Seriously...

1893
01:09:58,443 --> 01:10:01,110
He looks like he'd be a very strong drinker

1894
01:10:01,110 --> 01:10:04,043
but he's actually quite like a model student.

1895
01:10:04,043 --> 01:10:05,943
He's really like a model student.

1896
01:10:05,943 --> 01:10:08,410
- Just lie down. / - I can't drink.

1897
01:10:08,410 --> 01:10:10,810
- And the cocktail was so strong. / - He's cute.

1898
01:10:10,810 --> 01:10:12,743
- Really? / - He woke up right away.

1899
01:10:12,743 --> 01:10:14,876
Time out.

1900
01:10:14,876 --> 01:10:17,676
- You're red too. / - I'm drunk too.

1901
01:10:17,676 --> 01:10:21,476
- The two guys here can't drink. / - Ryan can't drink.

1902
01:10:21,476 --> 01:10:23,076
Only Jihye can drink well.

1903
01:10:23,076 --> 01:10:24,410
They don't go well with liquor.

1904
01:10:24,410 --> 01:10:26,276
- Only Jihye. / - Yes.

1905
01:10:26,276 --> 01:10:28,676
- They drank a lot. / - Please blur me out.

1906
01:10:28,676 --> 01:10:30,910
- He's drunk. / - How is that possible?

1907
01:10:30,910 --> 01:10:32,776
He had like a sip.

1908
01:10:33,243 --> 01:10:35,476
This is our last night.

1909
01:10:35,476 --> 01:10:36,676
I'm sad for it to end.

1910
01:10:36,676 --> 01:10:38,643
Let's say one good thing and one bad thing.

1911
01:10:38,643 --> 01:10:41,243
Let's say a bad thing first. How was it?

1912
01:10:41,243 --> 01:10:44,143
You didn't give us a lot of snacks during the tour.

1913
01:10:45,476 --> 01:10:48,010
I was so hungry while we were in the water.

1914
01:10:48,010 --> 01:10:49,143
We played a lot in the water.

1915
01:10:49,143 --> 01:10:50,310
I was so hungry.

1916
01:10:51,010 --> 01:10:52,576
The reason why we didn't have snacks was

1917
01:10:52,576 --> 01:10:53,876
to make you enjoy the meals.

1918
01:10:55,010 --> 01:10:56,276
Are you drunk?

1919
01:10:58,476 --> 01:10:59,943
The reason why we didn't have snacks was

1920
01:10:59,943 --> 01:11:03,010
to enhance Boom's reactions when eating meals.

1921
01:11:03,010 --> 01:11:05,143
- I made you hungry on purpose. / - That's right.

1922
01:11:05,143 --> 01:11:07,510
Say one good thing.

1923
01:11:07,510 --> 01:11:11,243
I felt that there was more to Boracay than the beach.

1924
01:11:12,310 --> 01:11:14,543
There's nature...

1925
01:11:14,543 --> 01:11:16,743
The activities we could experience...

1926
01:11:16,743 --> 01:11:17,910
The sea.

1927
01:11:17,910 --> 01:11:20,476
We could experience so many things.

1928
01:11:21,043 --> 01:11:22,976
- I liked that so much. / - Thank you.

1929
01:11:22,976 --> 01:11:24,676
I met a new Boracay.

1930
01:11:24,676 --> 01:11:26,010
A new Boracay.

1931
01:11:26,010 --> 01:11:28,476
I feel like I've healed on this trip too.

1932
01:11:28,476 --> 01:11:30,210
- Ryan Bang is so adorable. / - So good.

1933
01:11:30,210 --> 01:11:31,210
I really love this, Jihye.

1934
01:11:31,210 --> 01:11:33,776
This is unforgettable for me.

1935
01:11:33,776 --> 01:11:35,076
It doesn't matter if we lose.

1936
01:11:35,076 --> 01:11:36,410
So long as we're happy.

1937
01:11:36,410 --> 01:11:37,376
- Let's do this. / - Let's go.

1938
01:11:37,376 --> 01:11:40,610
♪ Cay, Cay, Boracay ♪

1939
01:11:43,076 --> 01:11:44,410
Battle Trip!

1940
01:11:44,410 --> 01:11:46,110
(RaBang Tour in Boracay, the end)

1941
01:11:48,243 --> 01:11:49,976
The mood is amazing there.

1942
01:11:50,376 --> 01:11:53,376
Continuing from last week,

1943
01:11:53,376 --> 01:11:56,010
a lot of people go to Boracay for their honeymoon.

1944
01:11:56,010 --> 01:11:58,210
They only think about the beach.

1945
01:11:58,210 --> 01:12:00,676

It looked so nice.

1948
01:12:02,843 --> 01:12:06,910
Malumpati has never been shown on TV.

1949
01:12:08,276 --> 01:12:09,710
Not even on Pinoy TV.

1950
01:12:09,710 --> 01:12:11,476
- Really? / - It's never been aired.

1951
01:12:11,476 --> 01:12:12,443
But it's such an amazing place.

1952
01:12:12,443 --> 01:12:13,876
If you ask the travel agencies,

1953
01:12:13,876 --> 01:12:15,010
there are package tours

1954
01:12:15,010 --> 01:12:17,010
where they provide pick up services.

1955
01:12:17,010 --> 01:12:18,143

1956
01:12:18,143 --> 01:12:19,643

1957
01:12:19,643 --> 01:12:21,710
Being boiled in the pot.

1958
01:12:22,343 --> 01:12:24,243
I love it.

1959
01:12:24,243 --> 01:12:25,843
And I want to taste the pork hocks so bad.

1960
01:12:26,843 --> 01:12:28,810
I was surprised at first,

1961
01:12:28,810 --> 01:12:30,143
because I thought they were boiling something

1962
01:12:30,143 --> 01:12:31,943
since we ate right next to there.

1963
01:12:31,943 --> 01:12:33,843
I thought they were boiling pork hocks

1964
01:12:33,843 --> 01:12:35,076
or something.

1965
01:12:35,076 --> 01:12:35,943
- Then all of a sudden... / - They tell you to go in.

1966
01:12:35,943 --> 01:12:38,110
Yes, they told me to go in.

1967
01:12:38,110 --> 01:12:39,910
I was surprised.

1968
01:12:39,910 --> 01:12:42,210
But the temperature was perfect and

1969
01:12:42,210 --> 01:12:43,310
the scent of lemon...

1970
01:12:43,310 --> 01:12:45,276
There was a stream right next to it.

1971
01:12:45,276 --> 01:12:47,210
It felt like paradise

1972
01:12:47,210 --> 01:12:49,743
looking down from there.

1973
01:12:49,743 --> 01:12:52,810
Japanese hot springs are famous.

1974
01:12:52,810 --> 01:12:55,810
But I never knew that they had such an amazing spa.

1975
01:12:55,810 --> 01:12:57,676

- Let's check the expenses. / - Okay.

1978
01:13:01,343 --> 01:13:03,310
The Yeom Tour in Hanoi

1979
01:13:03,310 --> 01:13:06,976
cost $217.70 cents for 2 days.

1980
01:13:06,976 --> 01:13:09,510
- It was cheap. / - What about the RaBang Tour.

1981
01:13:09,510 --> 01:13:12,110
Excluding air fares, how much did you spend?

1982
01:13:12,110 --> 01:13:15,610
Our trip was 4 days and 3 nights.

1983
01:13:15,610 --> 01:13:17,043

1988

1989
01:13:29,743 --> 01:13:31,576
- It's okay. / - It's double our budget.

1990
01:13:31,576 --> 01:13:33,543
They went on that expensive helicopter ride.

1991
01:13:33,543 --> 01:13:36,310
If you take that out...

1992
01:13:36,310 --> 01:13:37,976
And it cost an extra day for accommodation.

1993
01:13:37,976 --> 01:13:39,776
- That's right. It was 4 days. / - More on accommodation.

1994
01:13:39,776 --> 01:13:41,543
And you spent more on food.

1995
01:13:41,543 --> 01:13:43,776
Final remarks, Boom.

1996
01:13:43,776 --> 01:13:46,443
People say a lot of things about Boracay, right?

1997
01:13:46,443 --> 01:13:49,376
But there's only one thing I felt about Boracay.

1998
01:13:49,376 --> 01:13:51,110
Boracay is a treasure to the world.

1999
01:13:51,110 --> 01:13:53,976
Tourists around the world should protect the island.

2000
01:13:53,976 --> 01:13:55,910
It's beautiful.

2001
01:13:55,910 --> 01:13:59,410
And I want to go there again sometime

2002
01:13:59,410 --> 01:14:01,710
when I get a break.

2003
01:14:01,710 --> 01:14:03,943
That's what I felt about Boracay.

2004
01:14:03,943 --> 01:14:07,110
This could be our last so let's sing it one last time.
