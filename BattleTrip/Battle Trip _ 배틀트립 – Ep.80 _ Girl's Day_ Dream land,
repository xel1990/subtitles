(Yura, Minah of Girl's Day)

4
00:00:10,076 --> 00:00:11,209
Travel is war!

5
00:00:11,209 --> 00:00:13,609
Battle Trip!

6
00:00:15,209 --> 00:00:16,076
Continuing on from last week,

7
00:00:16,076 --> 00:00:18,143
we have California as our travel destination.

8
00:00:18,143 --> 00:00:20,209
We're joined again

9
00:00:20,209 --> 00:00:21,309
by our trip planners.

10
00:00:21,309 --> 00:00:23,309
- It was incredible last week. / - We're joined by...

11
00:00:23,309 --> 00:00:24,809
Han Donggeun, California expert..

12
00:00:24,809 --> 00:00:25,743
Hello.

13
00:00:27,076 --> 00:00:28,343
(Special host, Han Donggeun)

14
00:00:29,009 --> 00:00:31,743
After watching the California trip last week,

15
00:00:31,743 --> 00:00:33,609
didn't you feel like going back?

16
00:00:33,609 --> 00:00:35,576
I really wanted to go back.

17
00:00:35,576 --> 00:00:38,276
As I watched the video, I wanted to leave right away.

18
00:00:38,276 --> 00:00:39,509
What did you really want to do there?

19
00:00:39,509 --> 00:00:42,809
Among the foods that they didn't eat...

20
00:00:42,809 --> 00:00:43,943
Burrito.

21
00:00:43,943 --> 00:00:45,576
- Burrito! / - Burrito.

22
00:00:45,576 --> 00:00:46,876
- Burrito is... / - It's...

23
00:00:46,876 --> 00:00:48,709
- A favorite dish for students. / - Mexican food is popular.

24
00:00:48,709 --> 00:00:49,743
It was so unfortunate they didn't eat that.

25
00:00:49,743 --> 00:00:50,876
Why talk about unfortunate things?

26
00:00:50,876 --> 00:00:53,276
Well... Besides that,

27
00:00:53,276 --> 00:00:55,109
I was impressed by the camping.

28
00:00:55,109 --> 00:00:56,309
Don't change the subject.

29
00:00:56,309 --> 00:00:57,376
Camping? You mean the meat they ate?

30
00:00:57,376 --> 00:00:59,109
- Yes. / - The meat?

31
00:01:00,076 --> 00:01:01,643
I've never thought...

32
00:01:01,643 --> 00:01:02,376
You haven't done it yet?

33
00:01:02,376 --> 00:01:04,143
I could do such things.

34
00:01:04,143 --> 00:01:05,676
- Over there... / - It's because he was a student.

35
00:01:05,676 --> 00:01:06,443
- That's right. / - Right.

36
00:01:06,443 --> 00:01:07,743
And I was a minor too.

37
00:01:08,743 --> 00:01:11,376
Since you were a minor, all you could eat was burrito.

38
00:01:11,376 --> 00:01:14,276
- They sold it at school. / - With cola.

39
00:01:14,276 --> 00:01:15,476
It's cheap and tasty.

40
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:17,443
Well, today,

41
00:01:17,443 --> 00:01:19,076
we have our 100 impartial judges

42
00:01:19,076 --> 00:01:20,343
who will vote on today's trips.

43
00:01:20,343 --> 00:01:21,343
- Welcome. / - Welcome.

44
00:01:21,343 --> 00:01:22,676
Nice to meet you.

45
00:01:23,409 --> 00:01:25,576
(100 judges in the audience)

46
00:01:25,576 --> 00:01:27,909
Kim Sook, you like traveling.

47
00:01:27,909 --> 00:01:29,809
While you were watching the trip last week...

48
00:01:29,809 --> 00:01:31,976
- For me, the most envious... / - What made you envy?

49
00:01:31,976 --> 00:01:33,043
The wine train.

50
00:01:33,043 --> 00:01:34,709
- The wine train. / - I was most envious of that.

51
00:01:34,709 --> 00:01:35,909
The next was...

52
00:01:35,909 --> 00:01:37,443
Jihun, the pink boy.

53
00:01:38,409 --> 00:01:39,609
The way he goes bright red.

54
00:01:40,443 --> 00:01:43,309
It's a given for bad drinkers like me.

55
00:01:43,309 --> 00:01:46,343
Even if you can drink as well as Sikyung,

56
00:01:46,343 --> 00:01:48,643
you should be able to drink your fill of wine.

57
00:01:48,643 --> 00:01:51,776
He'd have the time of his life there.

58
00:01:51,776 --> 00:01:53,909
To be honest, the thing I found

59
00:01:53,909 --> 00:01:54,976
most regrettable about Northern California...

60
00:01:54,976 --> 00:01:56,543
- Was the reactions. / - Oh, the reactions.

61
00:01:56,543 --> 00:01:58,509
- Garbage reactions. / - Oh, the reactions.

62
00:01:58,509 --> 00:02:00,276
Garbage?

63
00:02:00,276 --> 00:02:01,576
But still.

64
00:02:01,576 --> 00:02:03,043
- Garbage? / - "This tastes the best."

65
00:02:03,043 --> 00:02:04,109
That's right.

66
00:02:04,109 --> 00:02:05,276
It was death.

67
00:02:05,276 --> 00:02:06,343
Jungwon was the worst.

68
00:02:06,343 --> 00:02:08,043
That's the best we could do as guys.

69
00:02:08,043 --> 00:02:10,376
This was a guy's trip.

70
00:02:11,176 --> 00:02:13,009
You guys made an eating show.

71
00:02:13,009 --> 00:02:14,843
- Of course. You can count on it. / - You two...

72
00:02:14,843 --> 00:02:16,609
- They love eating. / - They're good eaters.

73
00:02:16,609 --> 00:02:18,176
We're looking forward to the food.

74
00:02:18,176 --> 00:02:20,209
Yura, last week,

75
00:02:20,209 --> 00:02:20,976
I noticed you salivating

76
00:02:20,976 --> 00:02:22,876
when they drank wine.

77
00:02:22,876 --> 00:02:25,776
I personally love wine.

78
00:02:25,776 --> 00:02:29,243
So I... I can drink about a bottle and a half?

79
00:02:29,243 --> 00:02:30,309
- If she says one and half on TV... / - 1.5?

80
00:02:30,309 --> 00:02:31,676
That means she drinks 3 bottles in real life.

81
00:02:31,676 --> 00:02:33,609
Not 3 bottles.

82
00:02:33,609 --> 00:02:34,709
That's how you do it on TV, right?

83
00:02:34,709 --> 00:02:36,076
- You halve your actual limit. / - For TV.

84
00:02:36,076 --> 00:02:37,176
Just say about half.

85
00:02:37,176 --> 00:02:39,876
If it's 9% to 10% alcohol...

86
00:02:39,876 --> 00:02:41,609
When it comes to Yura...

87
00:02:41,609 --> 00:02:43,043
At the Napa Valley,

88
00:02:43,043 --> 00:02:45,509
take the wine train and buy some wine.

89
00:02:45,509 --> 00:02:47,309
Then head to Yosemite, go camping

90
00:02:47,309 --> 00:02:48,909
and drink some wine.

91
00:02:48,909 --> 00:02:50,376
I totally recommend that course for her.

92
00:02:50,376 --> 00:02:51,009
It's the best.

93
00:02:51,009 --> 00:02:53,476
For me personally, it was when you went star gazing.

94
00:02:53,476 --> 00:02:56,209
Would it better to do that with family or a lover?

95
00:02:56,209 --> 00:02:57,743
Why would you stargaze with family?

96
00:02:57,743 --> 00:02:58,909
Why not?

97
00:02:58,909 --> 00:02:59,976
Why?

98
00:02:59,976 --> 00:03:01,143
What's with you?

99
00:03:01,143 --> 00:03:02,943
- What's wrong? / - Why stargaze with your dad?

100
00:03:02,943 --> 00:03:04,476
- With a nice conversation. / - It's great to stargaze...

101
00:03:04,476 --> 00:03:05,243
With your son.

102
00:03:05,243 --> 00:03:06,909
But rather than do that with your father,

103
00:03:06,909 --> 00:03:08,409
wouldn't it be better with a lover?

104
00:03:08,409 --> 00:03:10,676
I don't think it matters.

105
00:03:10,676 --> 00:03:12,909
- The fact that you can share it with someone. / - Anyone.

106
00:03:12,909 --> 00:03:13,843
- Someone you love. / - That's so...

107
00:03:13,843 --> 00:03:15,176
- It's such a precious time. / - One definite thing.

108
00:03:15,176 --> 00:03:17,176
If you do it with a lover,

109
00:03:17,176 --> 00:03:18,943
you'll fall...

110
00:03:18,943 --> 00:03:20,276
- It'll go further. / - Deeper in love.

111
00:03:20,276 --> 00:03:22,276
I almost fell in love with Jungwon.

112
00:03:23,843 --> 00:03:26,876
Today, we'll look at the place Donggeun used to live in.

113
00:03:26,876 --> 00:03:29,043
- That's right. / - How do you feel?

114
00:03:29,043 --> 00:03:31,009
First, I'm looking forward to it.

115
00:03:31,009 --> 00:03:32,209
What exactly?

116
00:03:32,209 --> 00:03:34,443
I wonder where they've been to.

117
00:03:34,443 --> 00:03:35,276
I'm so curious.

118
00:03:35,276 --> 00:03:35,943
Because

119
00:03:35,943 --> 00:03:37,843
I know every spot there.

120
00:03:37,843 --> 00:03:39,509
- Of course. / - I guess so.

121
00:03:39,509 --> 00:03:41,943
First, to understand where you've been to,

122
00:03:41,943 --> 00:03:43,909
can you explain the places?

123
00:03:43,909 --> 00:03:46,476
You usually see the Hollywood sign...

124
00:03:46,476 --> 00:03:47,709
- Sign? / - From a...

125
00:03:47,709 --> 00:03:49,443
From the distance, right?

126
00:03:49,443 --> 00:03:50,743
The sign?

127
00:03:50,743 --> 00:03:51,743
- Hollywood. / - The Hollywood signboard.

128
00:03:51,743 --> 00:03:53,543
- The Hollywood? The signboard? / - That thing...

129
00:03:53,543 --> 00:03:55,609
The board you see on TV all the time?

130
00:03:55,609 --> 00:03:56,609
- Yes, but we... / - That...

131
00:03:56,609 --> 00:03:58,376
- On "L.A. Arirang?" / - We did something special.

132
00:03:58,376 --> 00:04:00,509
- We saw it from up close. / - It was special.

133
00:04:00,509 --> 00:04:01,743
It's actually a part of a tour course.

134
00:04:01,743 --> 00:04:04,176
You can see that in Gumi, Gyeongsangbuk-do.

135
00:04:04,176 --> 00:04:06,043
No, no.

136
00:04:06,043 --> 00:04:07,176
It was really awesome.

137
00:04:07,176 --> 00:04:08,576
On top of that,

138
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:10,776
we had a romantic dinner cruise.

139
00:04:10,776 --> 00:04:11,909
- Yes, a dinner cruise. / - A cruise?

140
00:04:11,909 --> 00:04:12,909
- Yes. / - Yes.

141
00:04:12,909 --> 00:04:14,109
On the second floor.

142
00:04:14,109 --> 00:04:16,309
- That's my dream. / - Enjoying live music.

143
00:04:16,309 --> 00:04:17,076
Cruises are really nice.

144
00:04:17,076 --> 00:04:20,009
The dinner cruise is similar to our wine train.

145
00:04:20,009 --> 00:04:20,609
The same feeling.

146
00:04:20,609 --> 00:04:23,009
No, it overlaps with their star gazing.

147
00:04:23,009 --> 00:04:24,076
Anyway.

148
00:04:24,076 --> 00:04:25,743
Will it be sadder when two men stargaze?

149
00:04:25,743 --> 00:04:27,643
- Stars... / - Or when two women do a dinner cruise?

150
00:04:27,643 --> 00:04:29,509
It's not enough to compare to stars.

151
00:04:29,509 --> 00:04:31,376
Aren't cruises for old people?

152
00:04:32,209 --> 00:04:34,243
Two women going on cruise together is weird.

153
00:04:34,243 --> 00:04:35,909
Don't old people stargaze on the mountain?

154
00:04:36,709 --> 00:04:37,843
No?

155
00:04:37,843 --> 00:04:40,643
Let's not dis each other too much.

156
00:04:40,643 --> 00:04:41,509
It's beautiful.

157
00:04:41,509 --> 00:04:44,143
We didn't want to just stay in the city

158
00:04:44,143 --> 00:04:46,909
so we went to Palm Springs

159
00:04:46,909 --> 00:04:48,476
which is a 2-hour drive from L.A.

160
00:04:48,476 --> 00:04:50,709
- It's a desert area. / - Palm Springs!

161
00:04:50,709 --> 00:04:52,209
It's a luxurious vacation spot.

162
00:04:52,209 --> 00:04:53,676
- That desert area is luxurious? / - Sure.

163
00:04:53,676 --> 00:04:55,676
There, we watched the desert and snow.

164
00:04:55,676 --> 00:04:58,509
We also enjoyed a variety of activities.

165
00:04:58,509 --> 00:05:01,143
- Did you go to a desert? / - But deserts in California...

166
00:05:01,143 --> 00:05:02,743
- They're extremely hot. / - Maybe.

167
00:05:02,743 --> 00:05:04,076
- What? / - They're extremely hot.

168
00:05:04,076 --> 00:05:05,943
- No shade? / - No.

169
00:05:05,943 --> 00:05:07,143
No shade at all.

170
00:05:07,143 --> 00:05:08,576
- No way. / - It wasn't hot at all.

171
00:05:08,576 --> 00:05:09,943
You haven't been, have you?

172
00:05:09,943 --> 00:05:11,243
He lived there for 4 years.

173
00:05:11,243 --> 00:05:12,576
- In the desert? / - Yes.

174
00:05:12,576 --> 00:05:14,076
Not in the desert.

175
00:05:14,076 --> 00:05:15,409
- The desert... / - Good job.

176
00:05:15,409 --> 00:05:17,843
He's not an insect. Living 4 years in the desert.

177
00:05:17,843 --> 00:05:19,376
- Is he a snake? / - It's not hot at all.

178
00:05:19,376 --> 00:05:21,676
The desert isn't just hot.

179
00:05:21,676 --> 00:05:23,843
We saw snow in the desert.

180
00:05:23,843 --> 00:05:24,576
- What? / - That's right.

181
00:05:24,576 --> 00:05:26,476
- We saw snow in the desert. / - In the desert?

182
00:05:26,476 --> 00:05:28,076
- You guys don't make sense. / - You can see snow?

183
00:05:28,076 --> 00:05:29,543
- You'll see. / - You'll see soon enough.

184
00:05:29,543 --> 00:05:31,143
- You'll see that it makes sense. / - Fascinating.

185
00:05:31,143 --> 00:05:33,876
When you think of California, you think warm weather,

186
00:05:33,876 --> 00:05:36,843
and the beach.

187
00:05:36,843 --> 00:05:38,176
Even the song.

188
00:05:38,176 --> 00:05:41,776
- ♪ California dreaming... ♪ / - What did you say?

189
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:45,609
- ♪ California dreaming... ♪ / - Kenya dream?

190
00:05:45,609 --> 00:05:46,576
Kenya dream?

191
00:05:46,576 --> 00:05:48,909
- You know the song. / - I know it.

192
00:05:48,909 --> 00:05:50,876
You think of it immediately.

193
00:05:50,876 --> 00:05:52,009
I think today...

194
00:05:52,009 --> 00:05:54,009
- We'll see that kind of footage. / - Yes.

195
00:05:54,009 --> 00:05:54,976
It's an incredible place.

196
00:05:54,976 --> 00:05:56,709
As we've been doing Battle Trip...

197
00:05:56,709 --> 00:05:58,843
There have been so many popular destinations.

198
00:05:58,843 --> 00:06:00,809
L.A. is a long distance

199
00:06:00,809 --> 00:06:02,309
but it's always in the top

200
00:06:02,309 --> 00:06:04,276
as a place people want to visit.

201
00:06:04,276 --> 00:06:06,409
- Right. / - But you've been...

202
00:06:06,409 --> 00:06:07,776
What's so good about it?

203
00:06:07,776 --> 00:06:11,276
At first, what I was most attracted to was the weather.

204
00:06:11,276 --> 00:06:13,309
The weather was very sunny.

205
00:06:13,309 --> 00:06:15,176
It's sunny but

206
00:06:15,176 --> 00:06:16,476
the breeze is very cool.

207
00:06:16,476 --> 00:06:18,643
- It's great weather. / - Good weather to have fun.

208
00:06:18,643 --> 00:06:20,509
- It was incredible. / - That's what L.A. is about.

209
00:06:20,509 --> 00:06:24,309
And did you see the orange sunset in "La La Land?"

210
00:06:24,309 --> 00:06:27,076
- Yes. / - We heard it actually exists.

211
00:06:27,076 --> 00:06:28,443
- Did you see it? / - Do we see it?

212
00:06:28,443 --> 00:06:29,843
- We win if that comes out. / - It comes out.

213
00:06:29,843 --> 00:06:30,743
- Did you film it? / - Did we?

214
00:06:30,743 --> 00:06:32,609
- We saw it on the dinner cruise. / - Right, right.

215
00:06:32,609 --> 00:06:34,309
- Did you actually see it? / - We did.

216
00:06:34,309 --> 00:06:35,209
At the restaurant.

217
00:06:35,209 --> 00:06:37,743
I didn't want to introduce obvious places.

218
00:06:37,743 --> 00:06:38,909
So we kind of...

219
00:06:38,909 --> 00:06:40,376
We made it less obvious.

220
00:06:40,376 --> 00:06:42,109
- Less obvious? / - If you made it really obvious...

221
00:06:42,109 --> 00:06:43,143
Like just stayed in Korea Town, it'd be good.

222
00:06:44,943 --> 00:06:46,143
- Let's check it out. / - Shall we?

223
00:06:46,143 --> 00:06:48,643
- Let's shout your tour name. / - Let's go.

224
00:06:48,643 --> 00:06:50,343
Shout out your tour name.

225
00:06:50,343 --> 00:06:51,743
- Yul... / - Yul...

226
00:06:51,743 --> 00:06:53,043
- Yul... / - Yul...

227
00:06:53,043 --> 00:06:54,176
- Bang! / - Argh!

228
00:06:55,409 --> 00:06:56,509
Let's check it out.

229
00:06:56,509 --> 00:06:58,809
(Southern California starts now!)

230
00:07:00,076 --> 00:07:02,843
(The day when the two teams met up)

231
00:07:03,643 --> 00:07:04,743
I'm so sorry.

232
00:07:04,743 --> 00:07:06,276
Hello.

233
00:07:06,276 --> 00:07:07,376
We just got here too.

234
00:07:08,443 --> 00:07:11,576
We'll decide north or south.

235
00:07:12,309 --> 00:07:13,509
So in the end...

236
00:07:13,509 --> 00:07:15,709
This is California, right?

237
00:07:15,709 --> 00:07:19,309
The south is from L.A. to San Diego.

238
00:07:19,309 --> 00:07:20,743
And the north is

239
00:07:20,743 --> 00:07:23,543
San Jose to San Francisco.

240
00:07:23,543 --> 00:07:25,343
I actually didn't know about the northern area before.

241
00:07:25,343 --> 00:07:28,676
As I watched them going there, I really want to visit.

242
00:07:28,676 --> 00:07:31,676
Since I'm not familiar with California,

243
00:07:31,676 --> 00:07:33,843
I'm so curious about everything.

244
00:07:34,943 --> 00:07:36,976
Good for you since we're going to where you want to go.

245
00:07:37,843 --> 00:07:39,376
From now, you'll like there too.

246
00:07:39,376 --> 00:07:40,609
I'm okay about everything

247
00:07:40,609 --> 00:07:43,109
except that I have a bad memory about L.A.

248
00:07:43,109 --> 00:07:45,943
Last year, you were too sick

249
00:07:45,943 --> 00:07:48,643
so you might have a painful memory about L.A.

250
00:07:48,643 --> 00:07:50,476
This time,

251
00:07:50,476 --> 00:07:53,276
let's travel around properly.

252
00:07:53,276 --> 00:07:55,643
- You'll erase my painful memories? / - Of course.

253
00:07:55,643 --> 00:07:56,809
You're a healer.

254
00:07:58,276 --> 00:07:59,276
Healed.

255
00:07:59,909 --> 00:08:02,043
She's a healer on a game commercial.

256
00:08:03,209 --> 00:08:06,609
We have to show the viewers what's there.

257
00:08:06,609 --> 00:08:08,609
We have to inform them.

258
00:08:08,609 --> 00:08:10,709
But for me personally...

259
00:08:10,709 --> 00:08:13,009
Hollywood Boulevard,

260
00:08:13,009 --> 00:08:14,509
Griffith Observatory...

261
00:08:14,509 --> 00:08:17,076
- That's right. / - A true special host.

262
00:08:18,576 --> 00:08:20,009
Griffith Observatory...

263
00:08:20,009 --> 00:08:23,376
- "La La Land" shoot location. They're so trite. / - Right.

264
00:08:23,376 --> 00:08:24,843
They're the trite places?

265
00:08:26,743 --> 00:08:28,543
It could be disadvantageous.

266
00:08:28,543 --> 00:08:30,009
- It was so hard. / - Not the obvious places.

267
00:08:30,809 --> 00:08:32,109
Rather than those places...

268
00:08:32,109 --> 00:08:35,009
I want them to say, "That's in L.A.?"

269
00:08:35,009 --> 00:08:36,609
- Kind of... / - Like what the locals do?

270
00:08:36,609 --> 00:08:38,876
- Yes, uncommon. / - There...

271
00:08:38,876 --> 00:08:40,476
I'd like to discover those types of places.

272
00:08:40,476 --> 00:08:42,343
I think that could be fun.

273
00:08:42,343 --> 00:08:44,909
Doing something active...

274
00:08:44,909 --> 00:08:47,409
Something that we can do physically.

275
00:08:47,409 --> 00:08:50,809
I'd like to go slightly outside of L.A.

276
00:08:50,809 --> 00:08:53,309
and discover some new places.

277
00:08:53,876 --> 00:08:54,943
Let's see.

278
00:08:54,943 --> 00:08:58,009
I really don't want to introduce common places.

279
00:08:58,009 --> 00:09:02,309
I was introduced to this place by someone...

280
00:09:02,309 --> 00:09:04,243
There's a totally wealthy neighborhood.

281
00:09:04,243 --> 00:09:05,709
Wealthy neighborhood?

282
00:09:05,709 --> 00:09:06,476
Wealthy?

283
00:09:06,476 --> 00:09:07,943
It's called Palm Springs.

284
00:09:07,943 --> 00:09:08,743
Palm Springs.

285
00:09:08,743 --> 00:09:12,343
- They say Leonardo DiCaprio... / - DiCaprio...

286
00:09:12,343 --> 00:09:13,876
He goes there so often.

287
00:09:13,876 --> 00:09:15,209
Then I can meet him there?

288
00:09:15,209 --> 00:09:16,976
I want to meet him.

289
00:09:16,976 --> 00:09:18,009
I love him.

290
00:09:18,009 --> 00:09:19,576
Palm Springs is a desert.

291
00:09:20,343 --> 00:09:22,343
I heard that it's so nice there.

292
00:09:22,343 --> 00:09:24,543
I saw it on some travel program.

293
00:09:24,543 --> 00:09:26,609
They slide on desert sand.

294
00:09:26,609 --> 00:09:27,676
- Do you know it? / - I know that.

295
00:09:27,676 --> 00:09:29,109
I'd like to do that if possible.

296
00:09:29,709 --> 00:09:31,809
- It's not that kind of desert. / - Oh, really?

297
00:09:31,809 --> 00:09:33,176
It's not a desert with sand.

298
00:09:33,176 --> 00:09:35,176
Is it like the place we did our photo shoot?

299
00:09:35,176 --> 00:09:36,276
Yes, kind of like that.

300
00:09:36,276 --> 00:09:38,276
That's the goddess concept.

301
00:09:39,376 --> 00:09:42,143
If we slide down there, we'll get all torn up.

302
00:09:44,743 --> 00:09:46,809
This place. Orange County is supposed to be nice.

303
00:09:47,409 --> 00:09:51,309
I heard that area is famous for surfing.

304
00:09:51,309 --> 00:09:54,109
It has 100 years of history.

305
00:09:54,776 --> 00:09:57,443
Then we'll go to L.A.,

306
00:09:57,443 --> 00:09:58,609
Orange County,

307
00:09:58,609 --> 00:10:02,076
and Palm Springs.

308
00:10:02,076 --> 00:10:03,876
Let's beat San Francisco.

309
00:10:03,876 --> 00:10:06,709
Should we end it by shouting our team name?

310
00:10:06,709 --> 00:10:07,509
Sure.

311
00:10:07,509 --> 00:10:09,409
I want something like this...

312
00:10:09,409 --> 00:10:11,676
Together with Yul and Bang.

313
00:10:11,676 --> 00:10:13,643
Yul, Yul, Yul, Bang! Argh!

314
00:10:14,709 --> 00:10:15,309
Sorry.

315
00:10:15,309 --> 00:10:16,309
- Yul. / - Yul.

316
00:10:16,309 --> 00:10:17,509
- Yul. / - Yul.

317
00:10:17,509 --> 00:10:18,576
- Yul, Bang. / - Argh!

318
00:10:18,576 --> 00:10:19,543
- Tour! / - Tour!

319
00:10:20,243 --> 00:10:21,343
What is that?

320
00:10:21,943 --> 00:10:23,043
So cute.

321
00:10:25,109 --> 00:10:26,343
- Yul Bang Tour. / - What are you guys saying?

322
00:10:27,509 --> 00:10:28,709
- Do it one more time. / - Yul.

323
00:10:28,709 --> 00:10:29,743
- Yul. / - Yul.

324
00:10:29,743 --> 00:10:31,376
- Yul. Argh! / - Bang. Argh!

325
00:10:31,376 --> 00:10:32,109
Tour.

326
00:10:33,009 --> 00:10:34,876
That's smart. You're a team with a good sense.

327
00:10:34,876 --> 00:10:35,743
What did you say?

328
00:10:36,809 --> 00:10:38,176
- Is it me who's talking? / - Is that you, Jihun?

329
00:10:38,176 --> 00:10:40,009
- Were you still there? / - Were you?

330
00:10:40,009 --> 00:10:42,243
- Why didn't you go, Jihun? / - We had our meeting.

331
00:10:43,209 --> 00:10:44,476
You're a team with a good sense.

332
00:10:44,476 --> 00:10:45,776
We might lose.

333
00:10:46,876 --> 00:10:47,676
Nice.

334
00:10:47,676 --> 00:10:49,743
(Yul Bang Tour, let's go!)

335
00:11:00,743 --> 00:11:02,976
(City of angels, blessed by the sun)

336
00:11:04,343 --> 00:11:06,443
(Great weather all year round, center of movies)

337
00:11:09,843 --> 00:11:11,376
It's L.A. for a reason.

338
00:11:11,376 --> 00:11:13,809
- It's the main city. / - That's right.

339
00:11:13,809 --> 00:11:16,076
I'm so curious since it's my first time.

340
00:11:19,109 --> 00:11:20,709
They drove a convertible too.

341
00:11:20,709 --> 00:11:22,876
It's a must.

342
00:11:24,443 --> 00:11:26,676
(Treasure vacation spot in the desert)

343
00:11:27,876 --> 00:11:29,443
The beach is 20km long.

344
00:11:29,443 --> 00:11:30,676
We're both standing.

345
00:11:30,676 --> 00:11:31,609
You did well.

346
00:11:33,343 --> 00:11:35,776
(Orange County)

347
00:11:36,343 --> 00:11:38,643
- Like the lead in a movie. / - In a movie.

348
00:11:40,476 --> 00:11:42,243
For California.

349
00:11:42,243 --> 00:11:43,143
Tastes so good.

350
00:11:43,143 --> 00:11:44,209
- Yul. / - Yul.

351
00:11:44,209 --> 00:11:45,543
- Yul. / - Yul.

352
00:11:45,543 --> 00:11:46,676
- Yul. / - Yul.

353
00:11:46,676 --> 00:11:48,043
- Bang. Argh! / - Argh!

354
00:11:48,043 --> 00:11:49,376
They really have fun together.

355
00:11:49,376 --> 00:11:50,143
- Tour. / - Tour.

356
00:11:51,076 --> 00:11:53,309
(Heading to the City of L.A.)

357
00:11:55,676 --> 00:11:56,909
There are direct flights, right?

358
00:11:56,909 --> 00:11:58,276
Direct flights to L.A...

359
00:11:58,276 --> 00:12:00,076
- There are several per day. / - Right?

360
00:12:00,076 --> 00:12:02,109
We've arrived in L.A.

361
00:12:02,109 --> 00:12:03,276
We have!

362
00:12:07,576 --> 00:12:08,276
I'm excited.

363
00:12:09,409 --> 00:12:10,876
Welcome to L.A.

364
00:12:11,443 --> 00:12:12,576
L.A.

365
00:12:13,209 --> 00:12:14,743
Los Angeles.

366
00:12:14,743 --> 00:12:16,009
Yura.

367
00:12:16,776 --> 00:12:19,076
I prepared something.

368
00:12:19,076 --> 00:12:20,676
- Right now? / - Sure.

369
00:12:20,676 --> 00:12:22,643
- What is it? / - I...

370
00:12:22,643 --> 00:12:24,376
Prepared a Korean taxi.

371
00:12:24,376 --> 00:12:26,143
- Korean taxi? / - A Korean taxi?

372
00:12:26,143 --> 00:12:27,776
You can book a Korean taxi?

373
00:12:27,776 --> 00:12:29,109
- You have to reserve it in advance. / - Yes.

374
00:12:29,976 --> 00:12:31,243
The great thing is that

375
00:12:31,243 --> 00:12:34,143
it's cheaper than ordinary taxis.

376
00:12:34,143 --> 00:12:36,709
Plus we can communicate with the driver.

377
00:12:36,709 --> 00:12:39,143
- There's no reason not to take it. / - Exactly.

378
00:12:39,143 --> 00:12:41,776
- It's convenient for Koreans. / - It's great that it's cheap.

379
00:12:41,776 --> 00:12:43,109
Isn't it?

380
00:12:43,109 --> 00:12:43,976
It's here!

381
00:12:45,709 --> 00:12:46,843
It's so big!

382
00:12:46,843 --> 00:12:47,876
This is our taxi.

383
00:12:49,709 --> 00:12:51,776
- It has an automatic door. / - Automatic door.

384
00:12:53,043 --> 00:12:56,009
(Make sure to check if it's an authorized vehicle)

385
00:12:56,776 --> 00:12:58,409
Is the driver Korean?

386
00:12:58,409 --> 00:12:59,309
Hello.

387
00:12:59,309 --> 00:13:00,743
- Hello and welcome. / - Hello.

388
00:13:00,743 --> 00:13:02,609
It's so nice to see you.

389
00:13:02,609 --> 00:13:04,876
- Hello. / - Hello.

390
00:13:04,876 --> 00:13:06,376
- Goodness. / - This is fascinating.

391
00:13:06,376 --> 00:13:09,043
Nothing to fear if you take a Korean taxi.

392
00:13:09,043 --> 00:13:10,176
Right.

393
00:13:10,176 --> 00:13:11,209
- Automatic door! / - Heading out now.

394
00:13:11,209 --> 00:13:11,876
- Okay. / - Okay.

395
00:13:12,443 --> 00:13:15,909
(In a taxi with an automatic door)

396
00:13:15,909 --> 00:13:19,343
(They go to L.A. from the airport)

397
00:13:21,343 --> 00:13:22,376
I like

398
00:13:22,376 --> 00:13:24,809
these trees in L.A. so much.

399
00:13:24,809 --> 00:13:26,043
The palm trees here.

400
00:13:26,843 --> 00:13:28,509
These trees are beautiful.

401
00:13:29,676 --> 00:13:31,176
By the way, the weather is really nice.

402
00:13:31,176 --> 00:13:32,643
That's incredible.

403
00:13:32,643 --> 00:13:34,476
It was so hot last time.

404
00:13:34,476 --> 00:13:35,709
Look at the sky!

405
00:13:35,709 --> 00:13:36,976
- It's spring. / - The sky!

406
00:13:38,843 --> 00:13:39,576
The weather is just right.

407
00:13:39,576 --> 00:13:42,509
It's spring here now, right?

408
00:13:42,509 --> 00:13:44,043
Actually, it's winter here now.

409
00:13:44,043 --> 00:13:45,809
Actually, it's winter here now.

410
00:13:45,809 --> 00:13:47,309
- It's winter now? / - Yes.

411
00:13:47,309 --> 00:13:48,809
- I envy the weather here. / - From November...

412
00:13:48,809 --> 00:13:52,009
To January, February, it's winter.

413
00:13:52,009 --> 00:13:53,109
We don't have rain here.

414
00:13:54,009 --> 00:13:55,043
I wonder what it'd be like

415
00:13:55,043 --> 00:13:56,643
to have the same weather all through the year.

416
00:13:56,643 --> 00:13:58,309
I want to get out of the car right now.

417
00:13:58,309 --> 00:14:00,009
I just want to open this door and get out.

418
00:14:00,009 --> 00:14:02,309
It's my third time in L.A.

419
00:14:02,309 --> 00:14:03,943
Don't worry about anything.

420
00:14:03,943 --> 00:14:04,776
No worries.

421
00:14:04,776 --> 00:14:07,109
In L.A.,

422
00:14:07,109 --> 00:14:09,809
I'll make sure it's not an obvious trip.

423
00:14:09,809 --> 00:14:11,776
I'm worried all we'll do is eat.

424
00:14:14,743 --> 00:14:17,276
It takes 30 minutes from the airport to Korea Town?

425
00:14:17,276 --> 00:14:18,676
It takes about 30 to 40 minutes.

426
00:14:18,676 --> 00:14:20,409
But sometimes there's traffic so...

427
00:14:20,409 --> 00:14:22,409
You should plan about an hour.

428
00:14:22,409 --> 00:14:24,043
(A fun Bang's Day Tour)

429
00:14:24,043 --> 00:14:25,309
(Arts District)

430
00:14:25,309 --> 00:14:26,443
(Sunset Ranch Hollywood)

431
00:14:26,443 --> 00:14:28,343
(Fancy dinner)

432
00:14:30,643 --> 00:14:32,176
L.A. is awesome.

433
00:14:32,176 --> 00:14:33,343
- Seriously. / - So sunny.

434
00:14:33,343 --> 00:14:34,943
I love it!

435
00:14:34,943 --> 00:14:36,509
The weather is so nice.

436
00:14:36,509 --> 00:14:38,176
That's right. The color of the sky is different there.

437
00:14:38,176 --> 00:14:39,543
The light is different.

438
00:14:39,543 --> 00:14:40,609
That's the middle of winter?

439
00:14:41,276 --> 00:14:43,376
Isn't this more like L.A.?

440
00:14:43,376 --> 00:14:44,776
Where's L.A.?

441
00:14:44,776 --> 00:14:47,176
- Yura, look at the sky. / - No Hollywood sign.

442
00:14:47,176 --> 00:14:48,943
(The sky?)

443
00:14:49,143 --> 00:14:53,509
- ♪ The sky is open for us ♪ / - It's too bright.

444
00:14:53,509 --> 00:14:54,476
So where are we?

445
00:14:54,476 --> 00:14:55,809
You need to explain since you brought me here.

446
00:14:55,809 --> 00:14:57,676
Yura, where I'm taking you now...

447
00:14:57,676 --> 00:14:59,309
It's called Arts District.

448
00:14:59,309 --> 00:15:01,976
We're in front of a subway station.

449
00:15:01,976 --> 00:15:03,276
Is that a subway station?

450
00:15:03,276 --> 00:15:04,209
Isn't it interesting?

451
00:15:04,209 --> 00:15:06,243
It's different to Korean subways.

452
00:15:06,243 --> 00:15:08,243
It's my first time taking the subway in L.A.

453
00:15:08,243 --> 00:15:10,976
I've only ever taken the taxi.

454
00:15:10,976 --> 00:15:13,243
- I've never seen L.A. metro. / - We're here now.

455
00:15:13,243 --> 00:15:15,943
1, 2, 3, 4. It only takes 4 stops.

456
00:15:16,776 --> 00:15:18,609
- 2, 3, 4. / - We can just buy a ticket and go.

457
00:15:20,509 --> 00:15:22,276
My first time in L.A.

458
00:15:22,276 --> 00:15:25,076
I'll show you how to get the ticket.

459
00:15:25,076 --> 00:15:27,276
One way trip.

460
00:15:27,276 --> 00:15:29,143
Oh, should we get the one-day pass?

461
00:15:29,143 --> 00:15:31,376
Yeah. That's sounds cheaper.

462
00:15:31,376 --> 00:15:33,543
But we didn't really take

463
00:15:33,543 --> 00:15:35,409
the subway much so...

464
00:15:35,409 --> 00:15:37,176
- One way? / - So we just bought the one-way ticket.

465
00:15:39,176 --> 00:15:41,476
- It's easy to take the subway in L.A. / - Easy.

466
00:15:41,476 --> 00:15:42,576
It's nothing.

467
00:15:42,576 --> 00:15:44,543
You can press "A" four times.

468
00:15:45,209 --> 00:15:46,509
Press "A" three times...

469
00:15:46,509 --> 00:15:49,009
You just have to press "A" three times.

470
00:15:49,009 --> 00:15:50,609
The subway in L.A.

471
00:15:51,776 --> 00:15:55,243
(What's this?)

472
00:15:55,809 --> 00:15:57,476
Can I just go?

473
00:15:57,476 --> 00:15:58,609
No, you can't.

474
00:15:58,609 --> 00:16:00,309
Doesn't an alarm go off? Don't they have it?

475
00:16:00,309 --> 00:16:01,576
There's no one there.

476
00:16:01,576 --> 00:16:02,776
No one to check your ticket.

477
00:16:02,776 --> 00:16:03,809
That's common when you go abroad.

478
00:16:03,809 --> 00:16:04,976
- It's up to your conscience. / - But...

479
00:16:04,976 --> 00:16:06,609
You pay 50 times when caught.

480
00:16:06,609 --> 00:16:07,743
I heard that they have a heavy fine.

481
00:16:07,743 --> 00:16:09,709
They won't know if you decide to get a free ride.

482
00:16:09,709 --> 00:16:12,143
You might get caught if you don't have a ticket.

483
00:16:12,143 --> 00:16:14,109
I guess so. There's no barrier here.

484
00:16:14,109 --> 00:16:15,076
There's nothing like that.

485
00:16:15,076 --> 00:16:16,943
- Why is that here? / - It's unique.

486
00:16:16,943 --> 00:16:17,676
That's really unique.

487
00:16:17,676 --> 00:16:18,909
It's so unique that no one checks your ticket.

488
00:16:18,909 --> 00:16:20,076
It must be a cultural difference.

489
00:16:21,409 --> 00:16:22,909
Here it comes!

490
00:16:24,243 --> 00:16:26,009
- Hello! / - It rang a bell.

491
00:16:26,009 --> 00:16:27,576
It's really a train.

492
00:16:27,576 --> 00:16:29,376
It said hello.

493
00:16:29,376 --> 00:16:30,443
I think it said hello to us.

494
00:16:31,576 --> 00:16:32,609
Can we get in here?

495
00:16:33,476 --> 00:16:34,443
I think we can.

496
00:16:38,209 --> 00:16:40,109
- Should we sit here? / - Should we?

497
00:16:41,276 --> 00:16:44,009
Is it because we're in L.A.? It's really cool.

498
00:16:47,576 --> 00:16:50,276
It's really different from the subway in Korea.

499
00:16:51,809 --> 00:16:52,843
It's so amazing.

500
00:16:52,843 --> 00:16:54,676
The seats are hanging.

501
00:16:54,676 --> 00:16:55,643
There are no legs?

502
00:16:55,643 --> 00:16:56,543
What's that?

503
00:16:56,543 --> 00:16:57,409
Amazing, right?

504
00:16:57,409 --> 00:16:58,776
The seats are hanging in the air.

505
00:16:58,776 --> 00:17:01,576
- There are no legs. / - No legs.

506
00:17:01,576 --> 00:17:02,576
Amazing.

507
00:17:02,576 --> 00:17:03,843
Very observant.

508
00:17:06,443 --> 00:17:07,409
We need to get off now.

509
00:17:07,409 --> 00:17:08,243
Let's get off.

510
00:17:08,876 --> 00:17:10,076
Let's go now.

511
00:17:12,243 --> 00:17:15,609
There's an area called Arts District.

512
00:17:15,609 --> 00:17:16,743
If we go there...

513
00:17:17,443 --> 00:17:19,409
The neighborhood itself is a work of art.

514
00:17:19,409 --> 00:17:21,776
It's so beautifully decorated.

515
00:17:21,776 --> 00:17:23,676
I suppose it's trendy place these days.

516
00:17:23,676 --> 00:17:24,709
You know...

517
00:17:24,709 --> 00:17:25,876
Instagram.

518
00:17:25,876 --> 00:17:28,109
Perfect place for Instagram photos.

519
00:17:29,276 --> 00:17:30,576
I have this thing...

520
00:17:32,176 --> 00:17:34,476
The most important thing for me when I travel

521
00:17:34,476 --> 00:17:35,676
is photos.

522
00:17:35,676 --> 00:17:38,809
And showing others where I've been.

523
00:17:39,443 --> 00:17:40,176
Therefore...

524
00:17:40,176 --> 00:17:41,176
Yeah, you're an attention seeker.

525
00:17:41,176 --> 00:17:42,076
Yeah, you're an attention seeker.

526
00:17:42,776 --> 00:17:44,576
Yes, that's true.

527
00:17:44,576 --> 00:17:45,543
I am an attention seeker.

528
00:17:46,743 --> 00:17:48,243
Then I need to take good photos.

529
00:17:48,243 --> 00:17:49,309
I'm really good at that.

530
00:17:49,309 --> 00:17:52,109
I took all the best shots for Hyeri and Sojin.

531
00:17:52,109 --> 00:17:53,576
I'm confident about that.

532
00:17:55,309 --> 00:17:57,643
(Arts District Station)

533
00:17:58,076 --> 00:18:00,176
Where's Arts Districtson?

534
00:18:00,176 --> 00:18:01,743
Arts Districtson?

535
00:18:03,143 --> 00:18:04,143
Arts Districtson.

536
00:18:04,143 --> 00:18:05,509
Where is that?

537
00:18:05,509 --> 00:18:07,409
Is that Arts Districtson?

538
00:18:08,243 --> 00:18:08,943
This is?

539
00:18:11,076 --> 00:18:13,043
It must start from here.

540
00:18:13,043 --> 00:18:16,209
This is Arts District.

541
00:18:17,009 --> 00:18:18,376
It's so pretty.

542
00:18:19,143 --> 00:18:20,776
Arts District was

543
00:18:20,776 --> 00:18:23,009
originally empty buildings

544
00:18:23,009 --> 00:18:24,876
and factories.

545
00:18:24,876 --> 00:18:27,276
From the 1970s,

546
00:18:27,276 --> 00:18:28,876
artists started living here

547
00:18:28,876 --> 00:18:31,209
and decorated the streets like this.

548
00:18:34,209 --> 00:18:35,676
Don't people shoot a lot of music videos there?

549
00:18:35,676 --> 00:18:37,409
- That's right! / - Foreign artists...

550
00:18:37,409 --> 00:18:40,843
- And most singers have shot there. / - Right?

551
00:18:40,843 --> 00:18:42,476
It's so pretty.

552
00:18:43,476 --> 00:18:45,643
Every single street is so pretty.

553
00:18:46,276 --> 00:18:48,143
Look, I'm going to capture everything here.

554
00:18:48,776 --> 00:18:50,943
I think the pillars are so pretty.

555
00:18:50,943 --> 00:18:52,576
How did they first think

556
00:18:52,576 --> 00:18:54,976
of these ideas for a utility pole?

557
00:18:55,909 --> 00:18:57,943
Even the trash cans are pretty here.

558
00:18:57,943 --> 00:18:59,343
- You're right. / - It's so...

559
00:18:59,343 --> 00:18:59,909
Take photos.

560
00:18:59,909 --> 00:19:04,343
Even the trash cans on the street were stylish.

561
00:19:04,343 --> 00:19:06,609
The trash can is very stylish.

562
00:19:06,609 --> 00:19:07,809
I want to take it home with me.

563
00:19:09,309 --> 00:19:10,843
Hey! Look at that.

564
00:19:10,843 --> 00:19:12,743
Hey! Look at that.

565
00:19:12,743 --> 00:19:14,509
The shoes...

566
00:19:15,909 --> 00:19:18,376
- There are shoes hanging there. / - Over the line.

567
00:19:18,376 --> 00:19:20,409
Even that seemed like a work of art.

568
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:23,009
You can't see this outside of L.A.

569
00:19:24,909 --> 00:19:25,709
Yura!

570
00:19:25,709 --> 00:19:26,609
This is it right here.

571
00:19:26,609 --> 00:19:28,609
- What is it? / - This utility pole...

572
00:19:28,609 --> 00:19:30,309
They created a work of art with tires.

573
00:19:30,309 --> 00:19:31,576
What?

574
00:19:31,576 --> 00:19:33,509
They created a work of art with tires.

575
00:19:33,509 --> 00:19:34,343
Amazing, right?

576
00:19:34,343 --> 00:19:39,409
- That's a famous piece around there. / - Fascinating.

577
00:19:40,076 --> 00:19:41,443
- This is so... / - It's really cool

578
00:19:41,443 --> 00:19:42,643
It really is cool.

579
00:19:42,643 --> 00:19:44,409
- You'd get great photos. / - It's starting.

580
00:19:45,076 --> 00:19:47,243
I'll take two versions of the same photo.

581
00:19:47,243 --> 00:19:48,943
I'll show you a comparison.

582
00:19:50,843 --> 00:19:52,876
1, 2, 3.

583
00:19:54,443 --> 00:19:56,343
People look shorter

584
00:19:56,343 --> 00:19:59,176
if there is a lot of space underneath them.

585
00:19:59,176 --> 00:20:00,176
But why do I look tall?

586
00:20:01,543 --> 00:20:03,343
You're originally tall.

587
00:20:03,343 --> 00:20:05,376
No, it's because I stretched my feet.

588
00:20:05,376 --> 00:20:07,609
You'll be surprised when you see the next photo.

589
00:20:07,609 --> 00:20:09,009
1, 2, 3.

590
00:20:09,943 --> 00:20:10,743
It's great.

591
00:20:13,209 --> 00:20:14,209
Isn't that amazing?

592
00:20:14,976 --> 00:20:18,376
Try to place the feet on the bottom of the photo.

593
00:20:18,376 --> 00:20:20,243
People will look two times taller.

594
00:20:20,243 --> 00:20:21,943
Not 2 times, but maybe 1.5 times.

595
00:20:21,943 --> 00:20:23,909
- You should've taken it like this. / - What is this?

596
00:20:23,909 --> 00:20:24,543
She really looks taller.

597
00:20:24,543 --> 00:20:27,043
It's the same pose but she looks taller

598
00:20:27,043 --> 00:20:28,576
because of the angle.

599
00:20:28,576 --> 00:20:29,776
(For some reason he's the loser)

600
00:20:29,776 --> 00:20:31,009
Isn't this amazing?

601
00:20:31,009 --> 00:20:32,743
I like how my face looks here.

602
00:20:34,343 --> 00:20:35,609
- Edit it. / - Do you want me to take yours?

603
00:20:35,609 --> 00:20:36,943
Yes!

604
00:20:36,943 --> 00:20:37,909
Take another photo for me.

605
00:20:38,609 --> 00:20:40,009
Okay.

606
00:20:40,009 --> 00:20:41,443
Do another pose.

607
00:20:41,443 --> 00:20:43,543
Like I'm waiting for someone.

608
00:20:43,543 --> 00:20:45,443
We took photos for 20 minutes there.

609
00:20:46,543 --> 00:20:49,176
We have to become angels since we're in L.A.

610
00:20:52,009 --> 00:20:52,743
Look at me.

611
00:20:52,743 --> 00:20:55,009
They must have taken a lot of photos there.

612
00:20:55,643 --> 00:20:57,443
This is California.

613
00:20:57,443 --> 00:20:58,609
So nice.

614
00:21:03,109 --> 00:21:05,576
(This place is)

615
00:21:05,576 --> 00:21:10,076
(Arts District)

616
00:21:12,343 --> 00:21:13,643
Don't you notice this?

617
00:21:13,643 --> 00:21:14,809
For girls...

618
00:21:14,809 --> 00:21:17,109
When you go on a trip with girl friends,

619
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:19,809
don't you enjoy the trip more

620
00:21:19,809 --> 00:21:21,343
if there's a good photographer among your friends?

621
00:21:21,343 --> 00:21:22,243
That's important.

622
00:21:22,243 --> 00:21:23,343
It's really important.

623
00:21:23,343 --> 00:21:25,709
80% of the trip depends on

624
00:21:25,709 --> 00:21:29,143
whether you take good photos or not.

625
00:21:29,143 --> 00:21:30,109
Both of us...

626
00:21:30,876 --> 00:21:32,343
- Are good at it. / - Minah.

627
00:21:32,343 --> 00:21:33,243
- Yul. / - Good work.

628
00:21:33,243 --> 00:21:34,143
- Yul. / - Yul.

629
00:21:34,143 --> 00:21:35,376
- Yul. Bang! / - Yul!

630
00:21:35,376 --> 00:21:36,209
- Argh! / - Argh!

631
00:21:36,209 --> 00:21:37,409
- Argh! / - Argh!

632
00:21:37,409 --> 00:21:38,176
- Tour. / - Tour.

633
00:21:39,009 --> 00:21:40,243
- Such a good match. / - They do it so well.

634
00:21:40,643 --> 00:21:41,376
I'm so hungry.

635
00:21:41,376 --> 00:21:42,909
As soon as we turn the corner...

636
00:21:42,909 --> 00:21:44,076
- We're here now. / - Where is it?

637
00:21:44,076 --> 00:21:45,043
- Is this the place? / - Pie...

638
00:21:45,043 --> 00:21:46,343
A pie place.

639
00:21:47,243 --> 00:21:48,976
- Pie restaurant. / - Los Angeles.

640
00:21:48,976 --> 00:21:50,676
- This place is so pretty. / - Isn't it so pretty?

641
00:21:50,676 --> 00:21:52,976
I also went there this time.

642
00:21:52,976 --> 00:21:53,809
- Really? / - Yes.

643
00:21:53,809 --> 00:21:56,109
I went for coffee and ended up having a pie as well.

644
00:21:56,909 --> 00:21:57,809
It looks so good.

645
00:21:59,576 --> 00:22:01,043
It looks so good.

646
00:22:04,143 --> 00:22:05,576
It looks really good.

647
00:22:05,576 --> 00:22:06,843
What is this? It looks so good.

648
00:22:06,843 --> 00:22:08,509
I can't choose.

649
00:22:08,509 --> 00:22:12,276
There are two really popular pies here.

650
00:22:12,276 --> 00:22:14,076
- Two? / - The Earl Grey pie.

651
00:22:14,076 --> 00:22:15,576
And the Mexican chocolate pie.

652
00:22:15,576 --> 00:22:16,709
They look so good.

653
00:22:17,509 --> 00:22:20,109
Mexican chocolate pie, one...

654
00:22:20,109 --> 00:22:23,376
- Earl Grey tea pie, one. / - Earl Grey...

655
00:22:24,643 --> 00:22:26,109
Just one piece, please.

656
00:22:27,709 --> 00:22:29,609
- The blue bricks are so pretty. / - That's right.

657
00:22:33,076 --> 00:22:33,609
Thank you!

658
00:22:33,609 --> 00:22:34,909
- Heart! / - Of course.

659
00:22:34,909 --> 00:22:35,743
- Love. / - There you go.

660
00:22:36,376 --> 00:22:38,676
You can have your pie right here.

661
00:22:38,676 --> 00:22:39,576
Thank you.

662
00:22:39,576 --> 00:22:40,643
- Thank you. / - This is your chocolate.

663
00:22:41,543 --> 00:22:42,343
It doesn't matter.

664
00:22:42,343 --> 00:22:44,043
I'm sorry, I'm not good at English.

665
00:22:45,809 --> 00:22:47,809
Thank you...

666
00:22:47,809 --> 00:22:49,109
So much.

667
00:22:49,109 --> 00:22:50,009
"So much."

668
00:22:50,009 --> 00:22:51,143
She looks really happy.

669
00:22:51,143 --> 00:22:52,043
The hot chocolate is so pretty.

670
00:22:52,043 --> 00:22:53,909
Why didn't she put my drink in a pretty cup?

671
00:22:55,676 --> 00:22:56,643
Take a picture.

672
00:22:56,643 --> 00:22:58,743
The hot chocolate is so pretty.

673
00:22:58,743 --> 00:22:59,876
Photos are important.

674
00:22:59,876 --> 00:23:01,909
- She's taking photos before eating. / - Can't eat.

675
00:23:01,909 --> 00:23:04,109
That's so pretty. They look so delicious.

676
00:23:04,109 --> 00:23:05,376
It's mine.

677
00:23:06,509 --> 00:23:08,576
I think we could take your drink out of the photo.

678
00:23:10,609 --> 00:23:11,809
Oh? Fork.

679
00:23:11,809 --> 00:23:12,509
I'm serious.

680
00:23:12,509 --> 00:23:13,309
Oh? Fork.

681
00:23:13,309 --> 00:23:13,943
I'm serious.

682
00:23:14,776 --> 00:23:15,609
No!

683
00:23:17,509 --> 00:23:18,209
Nice one.

684
00:23:19,109 --> 00:23:20,643
(What happened?)

685
00:23:21,576 --> 00:23:22,143
No!

686
00:23:22,143 --> 00:23:23,543
No!

687
00:23:23,543 --> 00:23:24,109
No!

688
00:23:24,109 --> 00:23:24,943
No!

689
00:23:26,743 --> 00:23:29,809
(Mean Yura)

690
00:23:30,609 --> 00:23:32,909
You have a weird personality.

691
00:23:32,909 --> 00:23:33,943
Yo, man!

692
00:23:34,609 --> 00:23:36,109
Men don't understand what's going on here.

693
00:23:37,409 --> 00:23:39,009
I'm still angry.

694
00:23:39,009 --> 00:23:40,176
I think it turned more artistic.

695
00:23:40,176 --> 00:23:41,309
I'm still angry.

696
00:23:41,309 --> 00:23:43,209
This street is like this.

697
00:23:43,209 --> 00:23:45,109
This is art.

698
00:23:45,109 --> 00:23:46,609
Stop talking nonsense.

699
00:23:48,676 --> 00:23:49,609
Look at her face.

700
00:23:49,609 --> 00:23:51,143
Isn't her personality weird?

701
00:23:54,909 --> 00:23:55,676
Is it good?

702
00:23:57,276 --> 00:23:58,276
It's really good.

703
00:23:59,076 --> 00:24:00,809
(Is it that good?)

704
00:24:02,609 --> 00:24:03,743
Isn't it really good?

705
00:24:04,843 --> 00:24:06,276
They put honey on top.

706
00:24:06,276 --> 00:24:07,743
- Is it honey? / - It's honey.

707
00:24:07,743 --> 00:24:08,843
Let's try them.

708
00:24:08,843 --> 00:24:10,076
What do you want to try first?

709
00:24:10,076 --> 00:24:11,643
- This is Earl Grey tea. / - Do you want to try this?

710
00:24:11,643 --> 00:24:14,443
You have to eat this together.

711
00:24:14,443 --> 00:24:15,476
What is that?

712
00:24:15,476 --> 00:24:16,443
Earl Grey looks good.

713
00:24:16,443 --> 00:24:17,709
That must be really delicious.

714
00:24:17,709 --> 00:24:18,743
This is awesome.

715
00:24:21,343 --> 00:24:22,843
It smells like Earl Grey tea.

716
00:24:24,676 --> 00:24:25,609
That must be delicious.

717
00:24:26,909 --> 00:24:28,776
(Oh, my)

718
00:24:28,976 --> 00:24:30,576
It's just like Earl Grey tea.

719
00:24:31,309 --> 00:24:33,376
It's like a taste I've never had before.

720
00:24:33,376 --> 00:24:34,576
The cream is amazing.

721
00:24:36,009 --> 00:24:37,443
The cream feels

722
00:24:37,443 --> 00:24:39,009
kind of like...

723
00:24:39,009 --> 00:24:40,509
Like you're taking a big bite.

724
00:24:40,509 --> 00:24:41,209
Chomp.

725
00:24:41,209 --> 00:24:42,209
Sugar recharge.

726
00:24:43,376 --> 00:24:46,076
- I like... / - I think this will be too sweet.

727
00:24:47,809 --> 00:24:50,409
(Mexican chocolate pie, $6.50)

728
00:24:51,509 --> 00:24:52,643
That looks sweet.

729
00:24:52,643 --> 00:24:54,509
It's the best if you have it with coffee.

730
00:24:54,509 --> 00:24:56,843
This is like red bean jelly.

731
00:24:57,443 --> 00:24:59,309
I thought it was red bean jelly.

732
00:24:59,309 --> 00:25:01,309
It's so thick.

733
00:25:01,309 --> 00:25:02,309
Doesn't it taste like red bean jelly?

734
00:25:02,309 --> 00:25:05,109
I'm expressing it. That it's thick like red bean jelly.

735
00:25:05,109 --> 00:25:07,409
So people understand what it tastes like.

736
00:25:07,409 --> 00:25:08,143
Nice face.

737
00:25:12,176 --> 00:25:14,076
It's completely different from the what I imagined.

738
00:25:15,776 --> 00:25:17,009
It's not that sweet.

739
00:25:17,009 --> 00:25:19,476
It really isn't as sweet as I expected.

740
00:25:19,476 --> 00:25:22,476
It looks really sweet...

741
00:25:22,476 --> 00:25:24,209
It's not the sweetness you like though.

742
00:25:24,209 --> 00:25:25,109
That's right.

743
00:25:25,109 --> 00:25:26,676
- Is it not sweet? / - It's not as sweet as expected.

744
00:25:26,676 --> 00:25:28,643
I ate it thinking it'd be real sweet.

745
00:25:28,643 --> 00:25:30,376
Is this what Mexican chocolate tastes like?

746
00:25:30,376 --> 00:25:31,943
It tastes like cinnamon.

747
00:25:31,943 --> 00:25:34,576
I had pecan pie there.

748
00:25:34,576 --> 00:25:36,843
It tasted exactly the same as Korean pecan pies.

749
00:25:38,243 --> 00:25:38,843
It's sweet.

750
00:25:38,843 --> 00:25:40,009
It's really sweet.

751
00:25:41,176 --> 00:25:41,909
But it's really delicious.

752
00:25:41,909 --> 00:25:43,009
Here.

753
00:25:43,876 --> 00:25:45,409
The crust is really good.

754
00:25:45,409 --> 00:25:48,243
- The crust is different for both. / - They are.

755
00:25:48,243 --> 00:25:50,209
- It's really sweet. / - Thing is...

756
00:25:50,209 --> 00:25:52,009
I'm satisfied with everything.

757
00:25:52,009 --> 00:25:54,376
But I'm happy just sitting here like this.

758
00:25:54,376 --> 00:25:56,809
I just like the fact I'm here.

759
00:25:56,809 --> 00:25:58,476
I love this overflow of relaxation.

760
00:25:59,609 --> 00:26:02,376
I just feel really relaxed.

761
00:26:02,376 --> 00:26:04,743
- Even the people around seem relaxed. / - Yeah.

762
00:26:06,409 --> 00:26:08,609
(Where will you go next?)

763
00:26:09,343 --> 00:26:11,409
Shouldn't we see the autographs of stars

764
00:26:11,409 --> 00:26:13,343
since we're going to L.A.?

765
00:26:13,343 --> 00:26:15,509
It's the symbol of L.A.

766
00:26:15,509 --> 00:26:18,276
We only get to see

767
00:26:18,276 --> 00:26:19,476
a tiny Hollywood sign.

768
00:26:19,476 --> 00:26:21,576
You can ride horses in front of there.

769
00:26:21,576 --> 00:26:24,776
It would be so nice to post that on Instagram.

770
00:26:24,776 --> 00:26:26,743
I think horse riding there...

771
00:26:27,643 --> 00:26:29,509
Wouldn't be obvious.

772
00:26:29,509 --> 00:26:30,676
This was really awesome.

773
00:26:30,676 --> 00:26:33,176
You won't know until you try it.

774
00:26:34,143 --> 00:26:36,676
(L.A.'s symbol, the Hollywood sign)

775
00:26:37,809 --> 00:26:41,709
(People only took small photos of it)

776
00:26:41,709 --> 00:26:44,743
(Let's enjoy it from up close)

777
00:26:45,576 --> 00:26:46,476
It feels so good.

778
00:26:47,609 --> 00:26:48,876
It's right in front of your eyes.

779
00:26:48,876 --> 00:26:50,243
This is awesome.

780
00:26:50,243 --> 00:26:52,609
It feels like I'm the main character in a movie.

781
00:26:53,743 --> 00:26:55,676
- There must be a way there. / - Follow me.

782
00:26:55,676 --> 00:27:00,943
(20 minutes by taxi to Sunset Ranch Hollywood)

783
00:27:01,443 --> 00:27:02,909
(The song is good)

784
00:27:06,776 --> 00:27:08,776
We're finally here to see the Hollywood sign.

785
00:27:08,776 --> 00:27:11,776
I told you that I would show it in a more special way.

786
00:27:11,776 --> 00:27:13,876
Where is the Hollywood sign?

787
00:27:13,876 --> 00:27:15,209
Is it near here?

788
00:27:15,209 --> 00:27:18,743
We will go to the Hollywood sign on horses.

789
00:27:18,743 --> 00:27:19,876
We will see it from close up.

790
00:27:25,476 --> 00:27:27,009
That's nice.

791
00:27:27,009 --> 00:27:29,876
- Only $60 for 2 hours? / - It was incredible.

792
00:27:29,876 --> 00:27:31,943
- Yes. Good price, right? / - Yes.

793
00:27:34,243 --> 00:27:35,976
(Welcome)

794
00:27:36,976 --> 00:27:40,609
(1-hour course per person, $40)

795
00:27:41,709 --> 00:27:43,543
- Hello. / - Hello.

796
00:27:45,609 --> 00:27:48,176
(After filling out the application form)

797
00:27:48,609 --> 00:27:49,543
Can you breathe?

798
00:27:51,409 --> 00:27:52,543
- Okay? / - Okay!

799
00:27:53,976 --> 00:27:55,843
(Heave)

800
00:27:57,676 --> 00:27:59,643
Do you know how to ride horses?

801
00:27:59,643 --> 00:28:01,309
The guides take the lead

802
00:28:01,309 --> 00:28:02,543
so you can ride safe alone.

803
00:28:03,276 --> 00:28:04,343
(Focused)

804
00:28:05,743 --> 00:28:07,709
Hello.

805
00:28:07,709 --> 00:28:08,609
Hello.

806
00:28:09,143 --> 00:28:10,576
Hurray!

807
00:28:12,576 --> 00:28:14,209
It's my first time riding a horse in such a place.

808
00:28:15,176 --> 00:28:16,776
This is fun.

809
00:28:16,776 --> 00:28:18,609
It feels strange to ride a horse in a place like this.

810
00:28:19,609 --> 00:28:20,776
I feel like I'm really riding a horse.

811
00:28:20,776 --> 00:28:23,643
Yura, we saw the Hollywood sign from a distance...

812
00:28:23,643 --> 00:28:25,143
- Doesn't this feel different? / - I know.

813
00:28:25,143 --> 00:28:26,809
It's right over there.

814
00:28:27,443 --> 00:28:28,709
It's right there.

815
00:28:28,709 --> 00:28:30,676
Yeah, we're going up there.

816
00:28:33,376 --> 00:28:36,676
(Incredible)

817
00:28:38,376 --> 00:28:39,909
- This is an incredible view. / - It's to die for.

818
00:28:39,909 --> 00:28:41,909
It's so good. Isn't this view amazing?

819
00:28:41,909 --> 00:28:43,209
It really is.

820
00:28:47,443 --> 00:28:48,576
It's so amazing.

821
00:28:48,576 --> 00:28:50,943
- The weather really is good. / - Oh, there...

822
00:28:50,943 --> 00:28:53,076
The camera can't really capture it.

823
00:28:53,076 --> 00:28:54,576
Seriously.

824
00:28:54,576 --> 00:28:56,009
Can you see the panoramic view behind me?

825
00:28:57,209 --> 00:28:58,509
The view in front of me is even better.

826
00:29:00,576 --> 00:29:03,676
Riding a horse here feels awesome.

827
00:29:04,976 --> 00:29:07,676
I heard you can see the whole of L.A. up there.

828
00:29:08,476 --> 00:29:09,176
Really?

829
00:29:10,643 --> 00:29:12,576
Goodness. This is incredible.

830
00:29:13,643 --> 00:29:15,309
I feel like I'm in a movie.

831
00:29:16,176 --> 00:29:18,309
You really feel like the lead of a movie.

832
00:29:22,576 --> 00:29:24,276
It's really amazing!

833
00:29:24,276 --> 00:29:25,676
Minah, look in front of you!

834
00:29:27,009 --> 00:29:29,409
I can see the entire city of L.A. here.

835
00:29:29,409 --> 00:29:30,243
All in one view.

836
00:29:32,343 --> 00:29:33,976
We can see everything.

837
00:29:35,143 --> 00:29:37,209
We're higher up than those buildings.

838
00:29:37,209 --> 00:29:39,409
This course is nice.

839
00:29:39,409 --> 00:29:40,943
It makes you feel great.

840
00:29:41,876 --> 00:29:44,343
(And)

841
00:29:44,343 --> 00:29:46,409
Goodness, Minah. It's right in front of us.

842
00:29:49,076 --> 00:29:51,243
Yura! This is amazing.

843
00:29:51,243 --> 00:29:52,676
Wow, this is seriously awesome.

844
00:29:54,109 --> 00:29:55,676
My goodness.

845
00:29:55,676 --> 00:29:56,976
Gosh, this is awesome.

846
00:29:56,976 --> 00:29:58,809
I can't describe how moved I was.

847
00:30:00,109 --> 00:30:01,776
This is insane. We're so close to it.

848
00:30:03,276 --> 00:30:04,309
Hey,

849
00:30:04,309 --> 00:30:05,776
this course is amazing.

850
00:30:09,643 --> 00:30:14,476
(Its very name excites us)

851
00:30:20,476 --> 00:30:22,409
I've never seen it this close.

852
00:30:22,409 --> 00:30:23,676
This is amazing.

853
00:30:25,943 --> 00:30:28,643
Each letter is 14m high.

854
00:30:28,643 --> 00:30:30,809
- Is it that big? / - It's really big up close.

855
00:30:31,476 --> 00:30:33,443
I thought the Hollywood sign was something...

856
00:30:33,443 --> 00:30:35,509
- You see only from a distance. / - Me too.

857
00:30:35,509 --> 00:30:37,776
So you can actually see it up close.

858
00:30:38,743 --> 00:30:39,709
I feel so good.

859
00:30:39,709 --> 00:30:41,643
Everyone would like this place.

860
00:30:41,643 --> 00:30:43,276
This place is the best.

861
00:30:43,276 --> 00:30:46,476
I didn't know there was a path where you can

862
00:30:46,476 --> 00:30:47,743
see the sign so close from.

863
00:30:47,743 --> 00:30:51,009
We were a little far because we were short on time

864
00:30:51,009 --> 00:30:52,709
but you can actually go right in front of it...

865
00:30:53,409 --> 00:30:54,176
On horseback.

866
00:30:54,176 --> 00:30:55,876
Riding a horse here...

867
00:30:55,876 --> 00:30:56,976
- It's so... / - It feels nice, doesn't it?

868
00:30:56,976 --> 00:30:59,676
Makes me feel like a heroine in a movie.

869
00:30:59,676 --> 00:31:02,276
- It does. / - ♪ Like a heroine ♪

870
00:31:02,276 --> 00:31:03,376
♪ Baby ♪

871
00:31:04,743 --> 00:31:05,776
This place is amazing.

872
00:31:06,643 --> 00:31:08,909
We should take a picture here.

873
00:31:08,909 --> 00:31:10,109
Will they get a photo of their lives?

874
00:31:10,109 --> 00:31:10,943
We do.

875
00:31:10,943 --> 00:31:13,109
Of course, we take those photos here.

876
00:31:15,643 --> 00:31:16,409
That's nice.

877
00:31:18,309 --> 00:31:19,909
- That's amazing. / - Right?

878
00:31:22,876 --> 00:31:25,376
This one wasn't obvious at all.

879
00:31:25,376 --> 00:31:26,809
I did a good job, didn't I?

880
00:31:26,809 --> 00:31:27,509
Yes, I'm so...

881
00:31:27,509 --> 00:31:28,943
I feel great.

882
00:31:28,943 --> 00:31:31,976
- Yura... / - The view is just insane.

883
00:31:31,976 --> 00:31:33,809
It isn't over.

884
00:31:33,809 --> 00:31:35,076
Today is the first day.

885
00:31:35,076 --> 00:31:35,776
Is there more?

886
00:31:35,776 --> 00:31:36,943
Of course.

887
00:31:36,943 --> 00:31:38,309
What's the beauty of traveling?

888
00:31:38,309 --> 00:31:39,643
- They should go eat. / - They should eat.

889
00:31:39,643 --> 00:31:40,343
It's time to eat something.

890
00:31:40,343 --> 00:31:41,276
Exactly.

891
00:31:41,276 --> 00:31:42,243
It's food.

892
00:31:44,043 --> 00:31:45,876
- So I... / - You're right.

893
00:31:45,876 --> 00:31:47,809
I didn't eat anything but pie today.

894
00:31:47,809 --> 00:31:49,043
I didn't eat anything but pie today.

895
00:31:51,843 --> 00:31:53,343
The next course will be

896
00:31:53,343 --> 00:31:54,976
quite impressive.

897
00:31:54,976 --> 00:31:56,043
Just follow me.

898
00:31:56,809 --> 00:31:58,209
- Let's hurry. / - Follow me.

899
00:31:58,209 --> 00:31:59,243
Let's go.

900
00:31:59,243 --> 00:32:01,209
- Let's go. / - Horseback is good too...

901
00:32:01,209 --> 00:32:02,543
But I'd love to walk up there.

902
00:32:02,543 --> 00:32:05,009
- It'd be fantastic to walk up. / - It'd be great.

903
00:32:05,009 --> 00:32:06,776
- The horseback riding was awesome. / - So good.

904
00:32:06,776 --> 00:32:08,476
- The horseback riding was great. / - It was.

905
00:32:12,943 --> 00:32:16,743
(This is a great place for family outings)

906
00:32:17,243 --> 00:32:18,509
Marina del Ray.

907
00:32:18,509 --> 00:32:19,943
- This place was really pretty. / - You went there?

908
00:32:19,943 --> 00:32:20,943
It was pretty.

909
00:32:20,943 --> 00:32:23,643
Yura, there are over 6,000 ships here.

910
00:32:23,643 --> 00:32:24,809
6,000?

911
00:32:24,809 --> 00:32:26,009
Yura, they're not just ships.

912
00:32:26,009 --> 00:32:27,409
The ships look huge.

913
00:32:27,409 --> 00:32:28,276
Right?

914
00:32:29,176 --> 00:32:30,043
It's a cruise.

915
00:32:30,043 --> 00:32:31,943
Are you boarding the dinner cruise now?

916
00:32:31,943 --> 00:32:34,943
Yes, because we had to see the sunset there.

917
00:32:34,943 --> 00:32:36,443
We had to hurry.

918
00:32:36,443 --> 00:32:38,409
The lighthouse and the houses look so pretty.

919
00:32:38,409 --> 00:32:39,409
It looks so pretty.

920
00:32:39,409 --> 00:32:40,176
Look at the houses.

921
00:32:40,176 --> 00:32:43,009
- I love the colors. / - It looks so pretty.

922
00:32:43,009 --> 00:32:44,609
- Is this it? / - They're waiting for us.

923
00:32:44,609 --> 00:32:45,409
Hi.

924
00:32:45,409 --> 00:32:46,243
Hello.

925
00:32:47,376 --> 00:32:48,276
This is so nice.

926
00:32:49,209 --> 00:32:50,343
Let's go.

927
00:32:52,409 --> 00:32:53,709
This is great.

928
00:32:53,709 --> 00:32:56,809
- So you're leaving on the ship. / - Where do you go?

929
00:32:56,809 --> 00:32:58,009
We just sail around the area.

930
00:32:58,009 --> 00:32:58,976
- Go around once? / - Yes.

931
00:32:58,976 --> 00:33:00,409
Just like a real cruise.

932
00:33:00,409 --> 00:33:01,609
Hey, check that out!

933
00:33:04,143 --> 00:33:05,076
- Hey. / - Yura.

934
00:33:07,076 --> 00:33:08,409
The sun is going down.

935
00:33:13,009 --> 00:33:15,176
It's different from L.A. we know.

936
00:33:15,176 --> 00:33:16,943
It's just a sea.

937
00:33:16,943 --> 00:33:18,143
- What's this? / - It's champagne.

938
00:33:18,143 --> 00:33:19,043
- Champagne. / - Nice.

939
00:33:19,043 --> 00:33:20,209
Thank you.

940
00:33:20,209 --> 00:33:21,643
Oh, it's champagne.

941
00:33:25,243 --> 00:33:26,743
To California.

942
00:33:26,743 --> 00:33:27,976
It tastes really good.

943
00:33:27,976 --> 00:33:29,543
- To California. / - It tastes really good.

944
00:33:31,043 --> 00:33:33,143
This tastes so good.

945
00:33:33,143 --> 00:33:33,843
It's good.

946
00:33:33,843 --> 00:33:34,743
It's so good.

947
00:33:35,409 --> 00:33:37,009
What do you think about what I prepared?

948
00:33:37,776 --> 00:33:38,709
This is darn fancy.

949
00:33:38,709 --> 00:33:39,643
This is darn fancy.

950
00:33:40,743 --> 00:33:41,876
Darn fancy?

951
00:33:41,876 --> 00:33:44,109
Darn fancy. My face is in trouble.

952
00:33:44,109 --> 00:33:45,143
My face is in trouble.

953
00:33:46,176 --> 00:33:47,209
Great expressions.

954
00:33:48,509 --> 00:33:50,343
When did I say that?

955
00:33:50,343 --> 00:33:51,109
Sunset.

956
00:33:51,109 --> 00:33:52,443
What's wrong with me?

957
00:33:52,443 --> 00:33:53,643
Are you filming "Titanic?"

958
00:33:53,643 --> 00:33:55,043
This is...

959
00:34:00,176 --> 00:34:01,176
Hurry up and take the photo.

960
00:34:03,576 --> 00:34:04,609
Okay.

961
00:34:05,476 --> 00:34:07,309
Your photographer is here.

962
00:34:07,443 --> 00:34:09,376
(Singing)

963
00:34:10,476 --> 00:34:13,276
(It's a musical on a cruise)

964
00:34:16,776 --> 00:34:19,109
♪ I don't know the lyrics ♪

965
00:34:21,343 --> 00:34:22,843
They don't know the lyrics.

967
00:34:26,809 --> 00:34:27,709
Jack!

968
00:34:27,709 --> 00:34:28,943
Turn around.

969
00:34:28,943 --> 00:34:29,976
Come back!

970
00:34:31,076 --> 00:34:33,676
Can you film my tear?

971
00:34:33,676 --> 00:34:34,776
It shows that I'm trying my best.

972
00:34:34,776 --> 00:34:36,876
- Let me see. / - Look at my tears.

973
00:34:36,876 --> 00:34:38,443
I'm shedding tears.

974
00:34:38,443 --> 00:34:39,643
I'm shedding tears because I was

975
00:34:39,643 --> 00:34:41,443
so passionate taking Minah's picture.

976
00:34:42,443 --> 00:34:43,909
This is not champagne. It's tear.

977
00:34:43,909 --> 00:34:46,076
It's a sad picture then.

978
00:34:46,076 --> 00:34:47,409
It's so sad.

979
00:34:47,409 --> 00:34:48,776
Let's go in.

980
00:34:48,776 --> 00:34:49,909
But seriously...

981
00:34:49,909 --> 00:34:51,676
- The atmosphere is really great here. / - I cried.

982
00:34:52,843 --> 00:34:55,176
- The pictures look great. / - It was really nice.

983
00:34:55,176 --> 00:34:56,876
Look at the pictures.

984
00:34:56,876 --> 00:34:58,343
She took nice pictures.

985
00:34:58,343 --> 00:35:00,143
- Lots of good photos. / - She's a photographer.

986
00:35:06,176 --> 00:35:07,143
Unbelievable.

987
00:35:07,143 --> 00:35:08,409
Unbelievable, Minah.

988
00:35:10,476 --> 00:35:12,376
- We have a live band. / - It's really nice here.

989
00:35:14,276 --> 00:35:16,076
Look at the sunset behind you.

990
00:35:17,276 --> 00:35:19,043
It's really nice here.

991
00:35:19,709 --> 00:35:24,109
This isn't the cheapest cruise...

992
00:35:24,109 --> 00:35:25,443
But $90 is pretty good, isn't it?

993
00:35:25,443 --> 00:35:27,009
It's not that expensive.

994
00:35:27,609 --> 00:35:29,009
I thought it'd be over $100.

995
00:35:29,009 --> 00:35:31,043
Still, $90 for one meal

996
00:35:31,043 --> 00:35:33,143
isn't exactly cheap.

997
00:35:33,143 --> 00:35:35,476
- So... / - But for this vibe...

998
00:35:35,476 --> 00:35:37,409
I think it's worth the money.

999
00:35:37,409 --> 00:35:39,509
$90 isn't bad at all.

1000
00:35:39,509 --> 00:35:42,176
This was really thoughtful. It's a sailor cap.

1001
00:35:42,176 --> 00:35:44,309
♪ Tell me your wish ♪

1002
00:35:44,309 --> 00:35:46,009
- ♪ Tell me your wish ♪ / - ♪ Just tell me 4 ♪

1003
00:35:46,009 --> 00:35:47,676
- Is that how the lyrics go? / - Yes.

1004
00:35:47,676 --> 00:35:49,209
Isn't it a four-course meal?

1005
00:35:49,976 --> 00:35:51,176
What?

1006
00:35:51,176 --> 00:35:52,443
I want four dishes.

1007
00:35:53,009 --> 00:35:55,343
(A luxury dinner for Yura)

1008
00:35:57,909 --> 00:36:00,043
I drank so much champagne.

1009
00:36:00,043 --> 00:36:00,909
This is the course menu?

1010
00:36:00,909 --> 00:36:02,476
- Yes. / - That's the set menu.

1011
00:36:06,643 --> 00:36:08,509
That tasted so good.

1012
00:36:08,509 --> 00:36:09,643
It looks good already.

1013
00:36:09,643 --> 00:36:10,576
It was so good.

1014
00:36:10,576 --> 00:36:12,809
Here come the reactions.

1015
00:36:12,809 --> 00:36:14,743
Check out that butter.

1016
00:36:16,909 --> 00:36:17,809
It's the pre-meal bread.

1017
00:36:18,476 --> 00:36:19,576
Thank you.

1018
00:36:19,576 --> 00:36:21,576
Forget photos. Just dig in already.

1019
00:36:21,576 --> 00:36:22,509
Get in there.

1020
00:36:23,076 --> 00:36:24,443
- She took off her hat. / - "Get in there."

1021
00:36:24,443 --> 00:36:25,209
"Get in there,"

1022
00:36:25,209 --> 00:36:26,009
Let's go.

1023
00:36:27,076 --> 00:36:28,109
Thank you.

1024
00:36:29,576 --> 00:36:31,676
- Thank you. / - How is this for free?

1025
00:36:31,676 --> 00:36:34,509
You can drink as much

1026
00:36:34,509 --> 00:36:36,309
champagne as you want.

1027
00:36:36,309 --> 00:36:37,309
You can drink as much as you want.

1028
00:36:37,309 --> 00:36:38,243
You can drink as much as you want?

1029
00:36:38,243 --> 00:36:39,443
- Yes. / - Champagne is unlimited.

1030
00:36:39,443 --> 00:36:40,576
- Unlimited champagne. / - Let's go.

1031
00:36:40,576 --> 00:36:42,409
- Yura, be honest. How many bottles? / - Let's go.

1032
00:36:42,409 --> 00:36:44,876
- Do we go to L.A.? / - 6 to 7 glasses.

1033
00:36:47,476 --> 00:36:49,143
(Dancing)

1034
00:36:51,643 --> 00:36:53,076
This champagne is so good.

1035
00:36:54,743 --> 00:36:58,343
(Time to start digging in)

1036
00:36:58,343 --> 00:36:59,443
What is this?

1037
00:36:59,443 --> 00:37:00,843
I think it's herb butter.

1038
00:37:00,843 --> 00:37:02,209
- Isn't that butter? / - That butter...

1039
00:37:02,209 --> 00:37:03,843
I wanted to bring that back home.

1040
00:37:03,843 --> 00:37:04,943
How does it taste?

1041
00:37:07,543 --> 00:37:09,443
Herb and pepper.

1042
00:37:09,443 --> 00:37:11,176
- It tasted of rosemary. / - It's cream butter.

1043
00:37:11,176 --> 00:37:12,376
- It was so good. / - Just so good.

1044
00:37:13,576 --> 00:37:15,343
You can have champagne and bread...

1045
00:37:15,343 --> 00:37:16,709
- Until you die. / - That's right.

1046
00:37:16,709 --> 00:37:17,609
Right, right.

1047
00:37:18,409 --> 00:37:19,676
- Things like that... / - Here it comes.

1048
00:37:20,476 --> 00:37:21,976
(Something is served)

1049
00:37:23,709 --> 00:37:25,543
Her hands are faster than our eyes.

1050
00:37:25,543 --> 00:37:28,509
We have a grilled coconut curry chicken

1051
00:37:28,509 --> 00:37:30,743
with mango chutney and duck and bananas.

1052
00:37:30,743 --> 00:37:32,509
- Duck? / - Help yourself.

1053
00:37:33,476 --> 00:37:35,209
- Duck? / - Help yourself.

1054
00:37:36,109 --> 00:37:37,543
(She unwittingly fights for the plate)

1055
00:37:38,176 --> 00:37:39,709
(Laughing out loud)

1056
00:37:39,709 --> 00:37:40,309
What's going on?

1057
00:37:40,309 --> 00:37:41,309
It looks like they're fighting.

1058
00:37:41,309 --> 00:37:42,276
They look like they're fighting.

1059
00:37:42,909 --> 00:37:44,509
(She unwittingly fights for the plate)

1060
00:37:44,509 --> 00:37:45,309
What's going on?

1061
00:37:45,309 --> 00:37:46,076
It looks like they're fighting.

1062
00:37:46,076 --> 00:37:47,143
They look like they're fighting.

1063
00:37:47,143 --> 00:37:49,276
(Scratch)

1064
00:37:49,276 --> 00:37:50,843
Ah, choice?

1065
00:37:50,843 --> 00:37:51,443
Yes!

1066
00:37:52,209 --> 00:37:54,276
(Disappointed)

1067
00:37:54,843 --> 00:37:55,643
Two?

1068
00:37:55,643 --> 00:37:57,176
Did you see her glaring?

1069
00:37:57,176 --> 00:37:58,109
I did.

1070
00:37:58,109 --> 00:37:58,809
Telling her to let go.

1071
00:38:00,343 --> 00:38:01,609
So that's what we actually did.

1072
00:38:01,609 --> 00:38:02,576
I only realized now.

1073
00:38:02,576 --> 00:38:04,209
You really jumped in there.

1074
00:38:05,209 --> 00:38:07,843
I would've been angry if she only let me take one.

1075
00:38:07,843 --> 00:38:09,976
But she let me take 3 so it's enough.

1076
00:38:11,376 --> 00:38:12,343
She's so funny.

1077
00:38:12,343 --> 00:38:14,276
She got drunk and went at it with the waitress.

1078
00:38:14,276 --> 00:38:15,376
The plate.

1079
00:38:15,376 --> 00:38:16,109
That's so...

1080
00:38:16,109 --> 00:38:18,043
She fought with her in that instant.

1081
00:38:18,676 --> 00:38:21,243
(Today's highlight is finally here)

1082
00:38:22,009 --> 00:38:22,743
Minah.

1083
00:38:24,243 --> 00:38:26,009
Wait a minute. I need a shot of this.

1084
00:38:26,009 --> 00:38:28,409
- Goodness. / - The gradation is really great.

1085
00:38:28,409 --> 00:38:30,176
The sky looks so beautiful.

1086
00:38:30,176 --> 00:38:32,743
It's so red. It looks like magma.

1087
00:38:33,576 --> 00:38:36,676
I thought the "La La Land" background was CGI

1088
00:38:36,676 --> 00:38:38,476
but it actually looked like that.

1089
00:38:38,476 --> 00:38:41,476
The sky looks like that wherever you are in California.

1090
00:38:41,476 --> 00:38:42,976
It was really beautiful.

1091
00:38:42,976 --> 00:38:45,143
Salmon with vegetables.

1092
00:38:45,143 --> 00:38:46,109
It's salmon.

1093
00:38:46,109 --> 00:38:47,609
Carrots and asparagus.

1094
00:38:49,276 --> 00:38:50,476
How did that taste?

1095
00:38:50,476 --> 00:38:52,109
- It was so delicious. / - It's salmon.

1096
00:38:53,943 --> 00:38:55,409
Thank you for the food.

1097
00:38:55,409 --> 00:38:56,543
It must be delicious.

1098
00:38:56,543 --> 00:38:57,409
(Surprised)

1099
00:38:58,609 --> 00:39:00,276
It felt so soft when I cut this.

1100
00:39:02,076 --> 00:39:04,309
- It melted in my mouth. / - Right.

1101
00:39:08,176 --> 00:39:10,143
(She puts it in her mouth)

1102
00:39:10,143 --> 00:39:12,509
The sun set into Minah's face.

1103
00:39:13,909 --> 00:39:15,643
Her face blushes in a cute way.

1104
00:39:15,643 --> 00:39:17,676
I blush in a sexual way.

1105
00:39:22,776 --> 00:39:25,209
(We are pink people)

1106
00:39:27,776 --> 00:39:28,909
It looks so delicious.

1107
00:39:31,143 --> 00:39:32,243
- Is it hot? / - It's so hot.

1108
00:39:35,543 --> 00:39:37,343
(Gosh)

1109
00:39:39,176 --> 00:39:40,276
I was so surprised.

1110
00:39:43,109 --> 00:39:45,209
If you do skits, we'll lose.

1111
00:39:47,109 --> 00:39:49,109
It's so soft. It melts in my mouth.

1112
00:39:49,109 --> 00:39:50,409
The salmon is so soft.

1113
00:39:53,143 --> 00:39:54,209
Try the salmon.

1114
00:39:54,976 --> 00:39:56,709
Did they fry this a little

1115
00:39:56,709 --> 00:39:57,876
on the outside?

1116
00:39:57,876 --> 00:39:58,909
It's so delicious.

1117
00:39:58,909 --> 00:40:00,109
- Right? / - It's so delicious.

1118
00:40:00,109 --> 00:40:01,209
What's after this?

1119
00:40:02,909 --> 00:40:03,709
There's more?

1120
00:40:04,643 --> 00:40:05,709
What is it? Steak?

1121
00:40:09,143 --> 00:40:11,176
Here we have braised short rib

1122
00:40:11,176 --> 00:40:12,476
with mashed potatoes

1123
00:40:12,476 --> 00:40:14,043
and a demi-glace.

1124
00:40:14,043 --> 00:40:15,843
Thank you.

1125
00:40:15,843 --> 00:40:17,209
I would have been upset if

1126
00:40:17,209 --> 00:40:18,876
we were not having meat tonight.

1127
00:40:18,876 --> 00:40:19,976
Yura.

1128
00:40:19,976 --> 00:40:22,009
What is this? Is this an onion?

1129
00:40:22,009 --> 00:40:23,543
Is this fried onion?

1130
00:40:23,543 --> 00:40:24,676
I think so too.

1131
00:40:24,676 --> 00:40:25,909
Is it steak?

1132
00:40:26,943 --> 00:40:29,276
Wow, look. The fork glides in.

1133
00:40:29,976 --> 00:40:30,976
What's this?

1134
00:40:30,976 --> 00:40:33,109
It wasn't steak. It was braised ribs.

1135
00:40:33,109 --> 00:40:34,043
Braised ribs?

1136
00:40:34,043 --> 00:40:35,643
It's different to steak.

1137
00:40:35,643 --> 00:40:37,143
It feels like braised ribs.

1138
00:40:37,143 --> 00:40:38,543
Check this out.

1139
00:40:40,943 --> 00:40:42,109
I don't need a knife.

1140
00:40:42,843 --> 00:40:44,209
I cut it and it melted.

1141
00:40:44,209 --> 00:40:46,076
I am going to eat this with the onion.

1142
00:40:53,043 --> 00:40:54,243
It's amazing.

1143
00:40:54,243 --> 00:40:55,209
It's so tasty.

1144
00:40:56,143 --> 00:40:57,143
Is it amazing?

1145
00:40:57,143 --> 00:41:00,043
- It was so delicious. / - Her mouth is so big.

1146
00:41:04,109 --> 00:41:06,209
Its texture was similar to Korean braised ribs.

1147
00:41:06,209 --> 00:41:07,509
Yeah, beef braised ribs.

1148
00:41:07,509 --> 00:41:11,109
I think Korean people will find this familiar

1149
00:41:11,109 --> 00:41:12,876
and enjoy it.

1150
00:41:12,876 --> 00:41:14,109
It's delicious.

1151
00:41:15,176 --> 00:41:16,476
It's so delicious.

1152
00:41:18,109 --> 00:41:20,443
This is so romantic, eating on the water.

1153
00:41:20,443 --> 00:41:23,309
I know. I forgot we were on a boat.

1154
00:41:26,443 --> 00:41:31,143
(Time passes like a dream)

1155
00:41:31,143 --> 00:41:32,976
Today was so fun, right?

1156
00:41:32,976 --> 00:41:35,009
We even rode a horse.

1157
00:41:35,009 --> 00:41:36,676
It was so fun to ride the horses.

1158
00:41:37,143 --> 00:41:39,543
We went to the Arts District too.

1159
00:41:39,543 --> 00:41:41,643
The dinner ended everything.

1160
00:41:42,409 --> 00:41:44,309
I prepared this trip for a long time.

1161
00:41:44,309 --> 00:41:47,876
I prepared the trip from start to end.

1162
00:41:48,443 --> 00:41:50,109
The schedule worked out well.

1163
00:41:52,143 --> 00:41:53,809
So proud of myself.

1164
00:41:53,809 --> 00:41:57,043
I'm planning to move away from the city.

1165
00:41:57,043 --> 00:41:58,309
Sounds good.

1166
00:41:58,309 --> 00:42:00,509
I prepared something really cool.

1167
00:42:00,509 --> 00:42:01,776
Just wait.

1168
00:42:01,776 --> 00:42:05,309
For tomorrow...

1169
00:42:05,743 --> 00:42:09,376
- Yul... / - Yul...

1170
00:42:10,109 --> 00:42:10,776
Yul.

1171
00:42:11,809 --> 00:42:13,143
- Bang! / - Argh!

1172
00:42:14,509 --> 00:42:15,643
Tour!

1173
00:42:16,109 --> 00:42:17,376
Cheers.

1174
00:42:17,376 --> 00:42:18,609
Cheers to us.

1175
00:42:18,609 --> 00:42:20,476
- They look so happy. / - That's so nice.

1176
00:42:20,476 --> 00:42:21,643
I want to go there.

1177
00:42:22,276 --> 00:42:24,643
I feel so good!

1178
00:42:25,776 --> 00:42:27,243
I'm so happy right now.

1179
00:42:28,976 --> 00:42:35,109
(Yura planned an active day full of excitement)

1180
00:42:35,109 --> 00:42:36,276
What is that?

1181
00:42:39,043 --> 00:42:40,343
Nice, nice.

1182
00:42:40,943 --> 00:42:43,109
You guys look a bit down.

1183
00:42:44,076 --> 00:42:46,576
When they had the shrimp and duck...

1184
00:42:46,576 --> 00:42:48,943
She was so strong. How could we beat that power?

1185
00:42:50,043 --> 00:42:52,576
The waitress must have been flustered.

1186
00:42:52,576 --> 00:42:54,676
- "Please choose one." / - But she grabs on.

1187
00:42:55,376 --> 00:42:56,143
Wait...

1188
00:42:56,943 --> 00:42:59,409
Give it. I even cleaned the whole table for this.

1189
00:43:00,309 --> 00:43:02,109
I was surprised that

1190
00:43:02,109 --> 00:43:05,009
L.A. had such a place nearby.

1191
00:43:05,009 --> 00:43:06,876
I felt like I was in Australia.

1192
00:43:06,876 --> 00:43:08,276
I agree.

1193
00:43:08,276 --> 00:43:09,643
It was special.

1194
00:43:09,643 --> 00:43:11,409
I have never seen people doing such things in L.A.

1195
00:43:11,409 --> 00:43:13,543
The weather was perfect too.

1196
00:43:13,543 --> 00:43:15,576
- The art... / - Arts District.

1197
00:43:16,843 --> 00:43:20,343
- I loved the place. / - It was cool.

1198
00:43:20,343 --> 00:43:22,243
I think I could stay there the whole day.

1199
00:43:22,243 --> 00:43:23,809
- And take photos. / - If you like photos...

1200
00:43:23,809 --> 00:43:28,143
It's the best. You can take photo shoot quality

1201
00:43:28,143 --> 00:43:29,709
photos there.

1202
00:43:29,709 --> 00:43:31,143
The thing I really like...

1203
00:43:31,143 --> 00:43:33,176
I was there around 2 days too...

1204
00:43:33,176 --> 00:43:35,476
It's like of like Seongsu-dong.

1205
00:43:35,476 --> 00:43:38,909
- There are cars and restaurants... / - That's right.

1206
00:43:38,909 --> 00:43:40,409
Why are you helping them?

1207
00:43:40,409 --> 00:43:42,676
- Keep going. / - No, keep talking.

1208
00:43:42,676 --> 00:43:43,776
- Please continue. / - And?

1209
00:43:43,776 --> 00:43:46,709
- You mean you'd rather go to Seongsu-dong? / - Yes.

1210
00:43:48,676 --> 00:43:51,709
If you want to go there, go to Seongsu-dong.

1211
00:43:51,709 --> 00:43:53,743
We'll vote for the first half now.

1212
00:43:53,743 --> 00:43:55,709
Will you visit Southern California

1213
00:43:55,709 --> 00:43:57,809
according to Yul Bang's plan. Yes or no?

1214
00:43:57,809 --> 00:43:59,609
Please vote!

1215
00:44:02,409 --> 00:44:04,976
(Yul Bang Tour planned a trip to Southern California)

1216
00:44:04,976 --> 00:44:06,676
(What will the judges choose?)

1217
00:44:06,676 --> 00:44:08,109
- The first half... / - It's here.

1218
00:44:09,609 --> 00:44:12,109
- I don't think many voted. / - Don't be shocked.

1219
00:44:12,109 --> 00:44:13,009
I don't expect much.

1220
00:44:14,009 --> 00:44:15,209
They're lovable.

1221
00:44:15,209 --> 00:44:17,343
- He's surprised. / - He's shocked.

1222
00:44:17,343 --> 00:44:19,543
- It's okay. / - For real?

1223
00:44:20,543 --> 00:44:22,476
We have some incredible judges here.

1224
00:44:22,476 --> 00:44:24,809
We would've gotten higher than this.

1225
00:44:24,809 --> 00:44:27,476
- No. There's no way. / - No way.

1226
00:44:27,476 --> 00:44:30,409
- You did not get higher than that. / - It's not that high.

1227
00:44:30,409 --> 00:44:31,409
- Really? / - Yeah.

1228
00:44:31,409 --> 00:44:33,143
- For real? / - I'm in shock.

1229
00:44:33,143 --> 00:44:34,776
Why are they so cheap?

1230
00:44:34,776 --> 00:44:37,376
Is it in the high 60s?

1231
00:44:37,376 --> 00:44:38,909
- No... / - I got it right.

1232
00:44:40,976 --> 00:44:42,243
I saw him flinch.

1233
00:44:42,243 --> 00:44:44,243
I'm right, aren't I?

1234
00:44:44,243 --> 00:44:47,243
You're going to look really foolish on TV later.

1235
00:44:47,243 --> 00:44:49,143
- Fine. / - They're really cheap.

1236
00:44:49,143 --> 00:44:50,209
Let's check out the second half.

1237
00:44:50,209 --> 00:44:53,076
- We've saved our best for last. / - Let's watch.

1238
00:44:53,076 --> 00:44:55,743
The Yul Bang Tour's Southern California trip.

1239
00:44:55,743 --> 00:44:57,376
Let's tune in to the end.

1240
00:44:57,376 --> 00:44:58,343
Let's go.

1241
00:45:01,843 --> 00:45:06,743
(Yul Bang Tour, day 2)

1242
00:45:08,209 --> 00:45:13,643
(L.A. is peaceful today as ever)

1243
00:45:18,043 --> 00:45:19,443
Ta-da.

1244
00:45:20,076 --> 00:45:21,843
So where are we going today?

1245
00:45:21,843 --> 00:45:24,143
Yura will be the guide for today.

1246
00:45:24,143 --> 00:45:25,976
We will rent a car today

1247
00:45:25,976 --> 00:45:27,509
to drive to Palm Springs.

1248
00:45:27,943 --> 00:45:30,876
I thought we will look cooler if we rent

1249
00:45:30,876 --> 00:45:33,443
a nice car.

1250
00:45:33,443 --> 00:45:34,209
Are we going to speed?

1251
00:45:34,209 --> 00:45:35,876
This is the car rental place.

1252
00:45:36,376 --> 00:45:38,076
- Did you make the reservation? / - Yes.

1253
00:45:38,543 --> 00:45:40,543
We... Reservation.

1254
00:45:42,176 --> 00:45:43,609
Where's the rest of that sentence?

1255
00:45:43,609 --> 00:45:44,609
Yura, wait a minute.

1256
00:45:44,609 --> 00:45:46,643
I have reservation.

1257
00:45:46,643 --> 00:45:47,676
She's good.

1258
00:45:48,509 --> 00:45:50,409
- Isn't it cheaper than San Francisco? / - $60 a day?

1259
00:45:50,409 --> 00:45:52,509
- That's all it cost? / - It's so cheap, right?

1260
00:45:52,509 --> 00:45:55,376
If you make the reservation earlier, it's cheaper.

1261
00:45:56,976 --> 00:45:59,676
(They successfully rent a car)

1262
00:45:59,676 --> 00:46:00,809
So excited.

1263
00:46:01,076 --> 00:46:02,409
Convertible!

1264
00:46:04,709 --> 00:46:05,676
Where is it?

1265
00:46:05,676 --> 00:46:07,143
- I think this is it. / - This?

1266
00:46:08,443 --> 00:46:10,676
- It's a red car. / - We got our car.

1267
00:46:10,676 --> 00:46:13,209
It looks so hot.

1268
00:46:13,209 --> 00:46:14,676
It really does.

1269
00:46:16,076 --> 00:46:17,943
Let's head to Palm Springs.

1270
00:46:17,943 --> 00:46:20,076
Let's go.

1271
00:46:20,076 --> 00:46:23,176
- Let's drive off. / - Let's go.

1272
00:46:23,976 --> 00:46:25,643
This is awesome.

1273
00:46:26,243 --> 00:46:27,143
No joke.

1274
00:46:28,009 --> 00:46:29,876
(Palm Springs' day)

1275
00:46:29,876 --> 00:46:33,243
(Tram)

1276
00:46:34,343 --> 00:46:38,443
(They are getting out of the city to go to Palm Springs)

1277
00:46:38,443 --> 00:46:40,476
The sky looks so beautiful.

1278
00:46:41,343 --> 00:46:43,276
The sky is always so pretty.

1279
00:46:43,276 --> 00:46:45,643
It's great that they don't have fine dust in the U.S.

1280
00:46:46,509 --> 00:46:48,376
Welcome to Palm Springs!

1281
00:46:50,843 --> 00:46:52,409
It looks so beautiful.

1282
00:46:52,409 --> 00:46:53,843
The fascinating thing is...

1283
00:46:53,843 --> 00:46:56,709
- It's only 2 hours away from L.A. / - Exactly.

1284
00:46:56,709 --> 00:46:58,843
It's only 2 hours...

1285
00:46:58,843 --> 00:47:00,609
- But it feels so different. / - Exactly!

1286
00:47:00,609 --> 00:47:03,576
Unlike our opposition.

1287
00:47:03,576 --> 00:47:07,076
We can enjoy the city in L.A.

1288
00:47:07,076 --> 00:47:09,743
then drive out a little to enjoy nature.

1289
00:47:09,743 --> 00:47:11,543
This is really amazing.

1290
00:47:11,543 --> 00:47:13,309
I think we will win this battle.

1291
00:47:13,309 --> 00:47:14,909
We've won already.

1292
00:47:15,376 --> 00:47:18,409
This is wonderful. Palm Springs is so good.

1293
00:47:18,409 --> 00:47:20,076
It's so cool.

1294
00:47:20,709 --> 00:47:23,343
The California we knew wasn't the real California.

1295
00:47:26,076 --> 00:47:27,843
It's that beautiful.

1296
00:47:28,609 --> 00:47:32,543
(They are driving fast in this wide desert)

1297
00:47:33,576 --> 00:47:36,209
If you drive fast there...

1298
00:47:36,209 --> 00:47:38,209
- Like that. / - It's just so...

1299
00:47:38,209 --> 00:47:39,776
- How exciting. / - It feels so good.

1300
00:47:39,776 --> 00:47:41,276
There aren't many cars.

1301
00:47:41,743 --> 00:47:44,709
(So excited)

1302
00:47:46,476 --> 00:47:47,976
(Having a blast)

1303
00:47:47,976 --> 00:47:50,376
I feel great!

1304
00:47:51,343 --> 00:47:53,243
I am so happy.

1305
00:47:54,643 --> 00:47:58,609
(Yul Bang Tour in Palm Springs)

1306
00:47:59,276 --> 00:48:03,509
This is the largest gondola lift in the world.

1307
00:48:03,809 --> 00:48:06,309
It goes all the way to the top of an alpine mountain.

1308
00:48:06,309 --> 00:48:07,543
(It only take 10 minutes?)

1309
00:48:08,209 --> 00:48:10,543
- Wouldn't it be so scary? / - It'll feel like a ride.

1310
00:48:10,543 --> 00:48:12,376
What if it travels up like this?

1311
00:48:12,376 --> 00:48:13,476
(Firing into the sky)

1312
00:48:13,476 --> 00:48:15,476
You've seen "Kingsman," right?

1313
00:48:15,476 --> 00:48:17,909
It's the same tram in the movie.

1314
00:48:17,909 --> 00:48:19,109
- That's the place? / - Really?

1315
00:48:19,109 --> 00:48:21,709
- Not the exact same one. / - Oh...

1316
00:48:21,709 --> 00:48:23,643
Wasn't "Kingsman" shot in England?

1317
00:48:23,643 --> 00:48:24,976
But it's the same thing.

1318
00:48:26,376 --> 00:48:28,009
(Tram Way)

1319
00:48:28,009 --> 00:48:29,309
(The world's largest rotary tram)

1320
00:48:29,309 --> 00:48:30,476
(Travel between the hot desert and alpine mountain)

1321
00:48:30,476 --> 00:48:32,376
- It rotates? / - It spins 360 degrees.

1322
00:48:32,376 --> 00:48:33,976
- But... / - You'd get dizzy.

1323
00:48:33,976 --> 00:48:37,409
- Not at all. It's quiet. / - It's really cool.

1324
00:48:37,409 --> 00:48:39,643
- It spins slowly. / - Looks so good.

1325
00:48:39,643 --> 00:48:44,009
(Tram Way, $25.95 per person)

1326
00:48:46,343 --> 00:48:47,609
Awesome!

1327
00:48:47,609 --> 00:48:50,743
- It looks just like the one in "Kingsman." / - Yeah.

1328
00:48:51,009 --> 00:48:53,643
(It really does look similar)

1329
00:48:56,476 --> 00:48:59,543
- Hi. / - If it goes fast, it'd be so fun.

1330
00:49:00,409 --> 00:49:01,643
It's very big.

1331
00:49:03,443 --> 00:49:05,776
(They're finally going up)

1332
00:49:07,843 --> 00:49:08,943
It's spinning.

1333
00:49:08,943 --> 00:49:12,609
(Eyes widen)

1334
00:49:13,243 --> 00:49:14,609
Oh, we're spinning?

1335
00:49:14,609 --> 00:49:16,276
Not the tram?

1336
00:49:18,176 --> 00:49:21,143
- That's interesting. / - The inside spins.

1337
00:49:22,176 --> 00:49:23,209
This is so cool.

1338
00:49:23,843 --> 00:49:27,709
There aren't many people now because of the shoot

1339
00:49:27,709 --> 00:49:30,343
but normally it's packed.

1340
00:49:31,609 --> 00:49:33,843
There are heaps of people normally.

1341
00:49:34,909 --> 00:49:37,376
We went there before it actually opens.

1342
00:49:37,376 --> 00:49:39,876
It's like the subway in the morning to work.

1343
00:49:40,676 --> 00:49:41,976
This is so scary!

1344
00:49:43,776 --> 00:49:45,309
This is so scary!

1345
00:49:45,876 --> 00:49:47,343
It's bumpy, right?

1346
00:49:47,343 --> 00:49:49,676
It's really high. It's the height of Baekdusan.

1347
00:49:49,676 --> 00:49:51,409
- It's really high. / - It really is.

1348
00:49:51,409 --> 00:49:54,343
- Where are you headed now? / - To the top.

1349
00:49:54,343 --> 00:49:56,476
(Almost crying)

1350
00:49:56,476 --> 00:49:58,243
It's shaking too much.

1351
00:49:58,243 --> 00:50:00,076
It's really scary!

1352
00:50:01,876 --> 00:50:03,309
(She's grabbing on tightly)

1353
00:50:05,343 --> 00:50:06,609
How was the speed?

1354
00:50:06,609 --> 00:50:07,909
- It was fast. / - Was it fast?

1355
00:50:07,909 --> 00:50:09,343
It looks like it's going up very slowly.

1356
00:50:09,343 --> 00:50:12,043
When you go past the tram next to you, it's like...

1357
00:50:12,876 --> 00:50:14,143
This is amazing.

1358
00:50:14,143 --> 00:50:16,443
It looks darn amazing here.

1359
00:50:17,976 --> 00:50:19,743
We're already up this far.

1360
00:50:19,743 --> 00:50:21,676
We can see everything.

1361
00:50:21,676 --> 00:50:23,709
We really need to shoot this. It's amazing.

1362
00:50:23,709 --> 00:50:24,576
It's amazing.

1363
00:50:26,343 --> 00:50:29,209
Here, the mountains are all rocky.

1364
00:50:29,209 --> 00:50:30,676
- This is amazing. / - I know.

1365
00:50:31,409 --> 00:50:33,176
Those trees are growing up from the rocks?

1366
00:50:35,043 --> 00:50:36,243
So nice.

1367
00:50:36,243 --> 00:50:39,176
- Wow, it's so... / - It's so cool.

1368
00:50:39,809 --> 00:50:42,043
It really heals you.

1369
00:50:44,609 --> 00:50:46,543
I feel so great.

1370
00:50:48,809 --> 00:50:50,476
You can see everything here.

1371
00:50:50,476 --> 00:50:52,209
You can see all of Palm Springs.

1372
00:50:52,209 --> 00:50:55,743
(It's an opportunity to see all of Palm Springs at once)

1373
00:50:57,009 --> 00:50:59,143
I think we're almost there.

1374
00:51:00,309 --> 00:51:01,476
Has it been 10 minutes?

1375
00:51:01,476 --> 00:51:03,176
You arrive in 10 minutes.

1376
00:51:03,176 --> 00:51:04,209
2,956m?

1377
00:51:04,576 --> 00:51:07,176
- That's about 3,000m. / - We're arrived.

1378
00:51:09,409 --> 00:51:11,343
- It's really fast. / - Yeah.

1379
00:51:13,809 --> 00:51:17,576
(How is it like to see Palms Springs from up here?)

1380
00:51:18,043 --> 00:51:20,476
It's Palms Springs!

1381
00:51:22,876 --> 00:51:24,743
This is fantastic.

1382
00:51:27,709 --> 00:51:29,976
It's truly wonderful.

1383
00:51:32,743 --> 00:51:35,943
- It feels like a dream. / - It's like a painting.

1384
00:51:38,409 --> 00:51:40,043
This is so pretty here.

1385
00:51:40,043 --> 00:51:43,343
- It has a totally different view here. / - Totally.

1386
00:51:44,209 --> 00:51:45,909
They have snow in California.

1387
00:51:48,043 --> 00:51:50,209
Snow, snow, snow! See it?

1388
00:51:50,776 --> 00:51:51,909
There really is snow.

1389
00:51:53,009 --> 00:51:56,143
- All you can do is marvel at the sight, right? / - Yeah.

1390
00:51:56,143 --> 00:52:01,209
I'm overwhelmed by the greatness of nature.

1391
00:52:02,543 --> 00:52:05,443
I feel like I'm being healed just by being here.

1392
00:52:08,643 --> 00:52:10,343
Hi, Yura!

1393
00:52:12,843 --> 00:52:13,909
She must be in a good mood.

1394
00:52:14,476 --> 00:52:15,709
- What the? / - She's dancing.

1395
00:52:16,576 --> 00:52:19,043
(Dance of delight)

1396
00:52:20,243 --> 00:52:22,743
(Put down your camera and enjoy the view)

1397
00:52:23,443 --> 00:52:25,676
It's Palm Springs.

1398
00:52:26,176 --> 00:52:29,743
- I'm at the highest point! / - This is made of rock.

1399
00:52:30,443 --> 00:52:31,809
I feel great.

1400
00:52:33,043 --> 00:52:35,076
I feel really good.

1401
00:52:35,476 --> 00:52:38,243
When you're up there, you really feel great.

1402
00:52:40,009 --> 00:52:43,476
This is that place where DiCaprio comes often.

1403
00:52:43,476 --> 00:52:45,343
Where's DiCaprio?

1404
00:52:45,343 --> 00:52:46,576
Let's walk around.

1405
00:52:46,576 --> 00:52:48,943
Jack, come back!

1406
00:52:48,943 --> 00:52:50,743
Come back, Jack!

1407
00:52:51,076 --> 00:52:53,009
Come back, Jack!

1408
00:52:54,343 --> 00:52:57,509
Since we're up on the top,

1409
00:52:57,509 --> 00:53:00,943
let's go back to Palm Springs and take a look around.

1410
00:53:00,943 --> 00:53:02,843
Let's look for DiCaprio.

1411
00:53:02,843 --> 00:53:04,643
I'll find him today no matter what.

1412
00:53:04,643 --> 00:53:05,743
We could run into him.

1413
00:53:05,743 --> 00:53:09,609
- Let's go! / - Go!

1414
00:53:11,276 --> 00:53:14,409
(ATV in the middle of the desert)

1415
00:53:14,409 --> 00:53:17,043
(12 minutes by car)

1416
00:53:19,543 --> 00:53:20,609
What is this place?

1417
00:53:21,143 --> 00:53:23,143
Have you heard of ATV?

1418
00:53:23,143 --> 00:53:24,843
I'm so excited.

1419
00:53:25,509 --> 00:53:28,376
When you go to the desert, you can ride an ATV.

1420
00:53:28,376 --> 00:53:29,743
I heard you can ride it here.

1421
00:53:29,743 --> 00:53:31,443
We can drive it.

1422
00:53:31,443 --> 00:53:32,609
I love things like this.

1423
00:53:35,409 --> 00:53:38,109
It's so fun when it's your first time.

1424
00:53:38,109 --> 00:53:39,809
It's really good here.

1425
00:53:42,976 --> 00:53:43,976
Won't it fall over?

1426
00:53:43,976 --> 00:53:45,509
- What is that? / - It never falls over.

1427
00:53:46,043 --> 00:53:48,909
The sand there is white and very fine

1428
00:53:48,909 --> 00:53:51,709
so you won't get hurt even if you fall.

1429
00:53:51,709 --> 00:53:54,143
This must be the protocol.

1430
00:53:55,376 --> 00:53:56,743
Isn't it so cute?

1431
00:53:57,709 --> 00:54:00,643
(How to safely use the ATV, wear a plastic cap)

1432
00:54:00,909 --> 00:54:02,143
- You have to wear it. / - What's that?

1433
00:54:02,143 --> 00:54:05,243
- Plastic cap? / - Because there's so much sand...

1434
00:54:05,243 --> 00:54:06,309
- You wear that first. / - Right.

1435
00:54:06,309 --> 00:54:07,243
What are these?

1436
00:54:07,243 --> 00:54:08,943
There are glasses in there.

1437
00:54:08,943 --> 00:54:10,709
To protect your eyes from the sand.

1438
00:54:10,709 --> 00:54:13,576
(Time to pick their sunglasses)

1439
00:54:13,909 --> 00:54:15,443
I'll take these.

1440
00:54:15,443 --> 00:54:17,943
- So much detail. / - We were really detailed.

1441
00:54:18,943 --> 00:54:20,843
(Put on a helmet)

1442
00:54:21,409 --> 00:54:23,509
(Safety lesson before driving the ATV)

1443
00:54:23,509 --> 00:54:26,743
(Learn how to use, get on and basic safety)

1444
00:54:27,609 --> 00:54:31,876
(She's excited and nervous at the same time)

1445
00:54:31,876 --> 00:54:33,276
Does this ever fall over?

1446
00:54:33,809 --> 00:54:35,209
I'm scared.

1447
00:54:36,076 --> 00:54:37,643
I was a little frightened.

1448
00:54:37,643 --> 00:54:39,109
Yura looks so excited.

1449
00:54:40,309 --> 00:54:41,209
Okay.

1450
00:54:42,376 --> 00:54:46,309
(They finally head off)

1451
00:54:46,309 --> 00:54:47,443
Nice.

1452
00:54:52,009 --> 00:54:54,076
(Moved)

1453
00:54:54,743 --> 00:54:56,009
I'm good at riding stuff.

1454
00:54:56,443 --> 00:54:59,309
- I like snowboarding too. / - Right.

1455
00:55:00,609 --> 00:55:03,409
- That was so much fun. / - It was so fun.

1456
00:55:03,409 --> 00:55:05,643
It feels heavy.

1457
00:55:08,309 --> 00:55:10,609
(Yura even stands up)

1458
00:55:11,376 --> 00:55:13,076
(She looks so cool!)

1459
00:55:13,809 --> 00:55:15,376
(Embarrassed)

1460
00:55:19,409 --> 00:55:21,509
She even goes in there.

1461
00:55:21,509 --> 00:55:22,843
Goes in and out.

1462
00:55:22,843 --> 00:55:24,409
There's nothing she won't do.

1463
00:55:25,343 --> 00:55:28,276
(She's very excited)

1464
00:55:29,176 --> 00:55:32,243
(Meanwhile, Minah is still afraid)

1465
00:55:32,843 --> 00:55:35,109
(Laughing out loud)

1466
00:55:35,109 --> 00:55:36,943
What's with that face?

1467
00:55:36,943 --> 00:55:38,076
I thought it was a cartoon.

1468
00:55:39,076 --> 00:55:40,443
Goodness, I'm so scared.

1469
00:55:41,243 --> 00:55:44,043
Why do those goggles look so good on her?

1470
00:55:47,609 --> 00:55:49,076
I'm so scared!

1471
00:55:49,776 --> 00:55:51,276
Where did she go? Where is she?

1472
00:55:51,276 --> 00:55:53,976
(Her fear results in getting stuck in sand)

1473
00:55:54,509 --> 00:55:56,876
(She's struggling to get out)

1474
00:55:58,543 --> 00:56:00,509
- Hey, Minah. / - It's hard once you get stuck.

1475
00:56:01,043 --> 00:56:04,609
(A fountain of sand)

1476
00:56:04,609 --> 00:56:06,676
Looks like a baby peeing.

1477
00:56:07,509 --> 00:56:09,109
(Very worried)

1478
00:56:09,609 --> 00:56:12,109
- Her goggles looks so good on her. / - I keep sinking.

1479
00:56:12,109 --> 00:56:14,576
I keep sinking.

1480
00:56:14,576 --> 00:56:17,009
It keeps sinking instead of coming out.

1481
00:56:17,009 --> 00:56:19,043
- Oh, dear. / - Oh, no.

1482
00:56:19,043 --> 00:56:20,443
Are you still sinking?

1483
00:56:24,109 --> 00:56:25,776
(Looking around)

1484
00:56:26,176 --> 00:56:27,976
Is anyone out there?

1485
00:56:28,776 --> 00:56:30,909
Help me!

1486
00:56:32,776 --> 00:56:35,009
Help me!

1487
00:56:35,443 --> 00:56:37,443
Help me, please!

1488
00:56:38,443 --> 00:56:41,276
(Someone appears in the speed of light)

1489
00:56:41,276 --> 00:56:42,109
Where did he come from?

1490
00:56:44,243 --> 00:56:44,776
(Lifts with one hand)

1491
00:56:44,776 --> 00:56:46,109
(With a help of the staff, she gets out safely)

1492
00:56:47,843 --> 00:56:49,076
He's so cool.

1493
00:56:49,376 --> 00:56:51,076
(It's not my business)

1494
00:56:51,076 --> 00:56:52,143
Thank you.

1495
00:56:54,443 --> 00:56:56,709
(She sheds her fear and enjoys the view)

1496
00:56:56,709 --> 00:56:58,109
This is so amazing.

1497
00:56:58,609 --> 00:56:59,409
This is awesome.

1498
00:56:59,943 --> 00:57:01,243
What a wonderful place.

1499
00:57:02,209 --> 00:57:03,543
We're really in the desert.

1500
00:57:03,543 --> 00:57:10,076
(They're enjoying their ride in the wide open desert)

1501
00:57:10,076 --> 00:57:11,809
I want to try standing too.

1502
00:57:13,243 --> 00:57:15,643
How exciting!

1503
00:57:17,976 --> 00:57:19,643
(Traversing the desert to their heart's content)

1504
00:57:25,176 --> 00:57:26,609
This is so much fun!

1505
00:57:29,643 --> 00:57:32,343
In my opinion...

1506
00:57:32,343 --> 00:57:34,809
- Eating is very crucial to get more votes. / - Right.

1507
00:57:34,809 --> 00:57:36,943
When they see delicious food,

1508
00:57:36,943 --> 00:57:39,509
they really want to visit and taste that food.

1509
00:57:39,509 --> 00:57:41,643
Choosing the right food is really important.

1510
00:57:41,643 --> 00:57:42,643
We should look into the best restaurants in the area.

1511
00:57:42,643 --> 00:57:45,143
You can't leave out food on a trip.

1512
00:57:45,143 --> 00:57:47,076
- Let's look for unique places. / - Yeah, let's look.

1513
00:57:48,676 --> 00:57:50,176
(Yul's Day)

1514
00:57:50,176 --> 00:57:51,543
- It's... / - To a local restaurant?

1515
00:57:51,543 --> 00:57:53,343
It's a local restaurant

1516
00:57:53,343 --> 00:57:54,709
with a unique design.

1517
00:57:54,709 --> 00:57:58,909
(Only enjoying nature in Palm Springs?)

1518
00:57:59,909 --> 00:58:02,309
(After driving through nature for 30 minutes)

1519
00:58:02,309 --> 00:58:05,509
I felt like I was living in that neighborhood.

1520
00:58:05,509 --> 00:58:07,209
- You felt that. / - It was that kind of a trip.

1521
00:58:07,209 --> 00:58:08,276
That makes the trip fun.

1522
00:58:10,709 --> 00:58:15,209
I reserved a famous restaurant in Palm Springs.

1523
00:58:15,209 --> 00:58:18,476
Wow, you prepared a lot.

1524
00:58:18,476 --> 00:58:21,143
This is the most famous one in Palm Springs.

1525
00:58:21,143 --> 00:58:23,976
- What's the best menu here? / - Just go in first.

1526
00:58:23,976 --> 00:58:25,576
So confident.

1527
00:58:28,076 --> 00:58:29,609
It's nice here.

1528
00:58:30,443 --> 00:58:32,409
It's so nice.

1529
00:58:32,409 --> 00:58:34,509
I really like it here.

1530
00:58:34,509 --> 00:58:37,043
It's modern and fancy at the same time.

1531
00:58:37,809 --> 00:58:40,709
- The interior is colorful. / - It's a very big place.

1532
00:58:40,709 --> 00:58:43,143
- It was so beautiful. / - It's really pretty.

1533
00:58:43,143 --> 00:58:46,676
It feels free and beautiful.

1534
00:58:48,276 --> 00:58:51,109
What I really liked was the variety of food.

1535
00:58:52,543 --> 00:58:54,809
(Looking around)

1536
00:58:55,209 --> 00:58:57,943
If you look around, the food looks good.

1537
00:58:57,943 --> 00:59:00,176
There's a lot of variety. They sell burgers too.

1538
00:59:00,909 --> 00:59:02,176
What's that?

1539
00:59:03,676 --> 00:59:05,109
(What are you doing?)

1540
00:59:06,076 --> 00:59:07,343
(Spying on other's food)

1541
00:59:09,843 --> 00:59:11,309
They're a team.

1542
00:59:12,009 --> 00:59:14,276
To be honest, I want to taste everything

1543
00:59:14,276 --> 00:59:15,509
that the people on other tables are eating.

1544
00:59:16,109 --> 00:59:17,409
Here we go.

1545
00:59:18,243 --> 00:59:20,576
Beautiful wild mushroom soup.

1546
00:59:20,676 --> 00:59:23,309
- It really looks delicious. / - That was so good.

1547
00:59:23,876 --> 00:59:24,743
What is this?

1548
00:59:24,743 --> 00:59:25,876
Mushroom soup.

1549
00:59:25,876 --> 00:59:27,776
It was really delicious.

1550
00:59:27,776 --> 00:59:29,076
- I think they ground it. / - You're right.

1551
00:59:29,076 --> 00:59:30,209
It smells incredible.

1552
00:59:31,009 --> 00:59:31,909
It's truffle oil.

1553
00:59:32,776 --> 00:59:34,976
I really like button mushroom soup.

1554
00:59:34,976 --> 00:59:37,143
Such a big portion size.

1555
00:59:37,143 --> 00:59:38,643
I guess they grounded mushrooms in here.

1556
00:59:41,909 --> 00:59:43,476
(Is it that delicious?)

1557
00:59:44,343 --> 00:59:45,576
What do we do?

1558
00:59:45,576 --> 00:59:47,209
I really want to eat it again!

1559
00:59:47,209 --> 00:59:49,276
- For real. / - So cute.

1560
00:59:50,143 --> 00:59:53,009
I want to take this home. It's so delicious.

1561
00:59:53,009 --> 00:59:54,509
(It makes her dance)

1562
00:59:54,509 --> 00:59:57,209
We usually have button mushrooms chopped in soup

1563
00:59:57,209 --> 00:59:58,943
but they grounded it here.

1564
00:59:58,943 --> 01:00:02,009
- I definitely taste truffle oil. / - Yes. It's good.

1565
01:00:02,009 --> 01:00:03,176
I...

1566
01:00:05,143 --> 01:00:06,843
I think I'm born to eat. I'm not joking.

1567
01:00:08,143 --> 01:00:10,009
I find great happiness in eating.

1568
01:00:11,076 --> 01:00:14,743
(Her spoon moves so fast)

1569
01:00:15,209 --> 01:00:16,843
You should show them your bowl.

1570
01:00:17,976 --> 01:00:19,576
I almost finished it already.

1571
01:00:19,576 --> 01:00:21,876
I want to eat the main dish now.

1572
01:00:21,876 --> 01:00:24,509
I want to eat it. Give me my food now!

1573
01:00:25,376 --> 01:00:27,609
Here comes our food!

1574
01:00:28,409 --> 01:00:31,043
I noticed it. It looked like ours.

1575
01:00:31,543 --> 01:00:33,509
- You knew it. / - I knew it.

1576
01:00:33,509 --> 01:00:36,576
- Wow. / - Wow.

1577
01:00:37,109 --> 01:00:39,576
- Their reactions are so good. / - So good.

1578
01:00:41,976 --> 01:00:43,643
(It's a perfect reaction)

1579
01:00:45,876 --> 01:00:47,376
It was really delicious.

1580
01:00:49,876 --> 01:00:53,543
(Filet mignon)

1581
01:00:53,543 --> 01:00:54,776
So good.

1582
01:00:54,776 --> 01:00:57,309
It melts in your mouth with the avocado.

1583
01:00:57,309 --> 01:00:58,876
Our food was also very delicious.

1584
01:01:00,076 --> 01:01:05,109
(Seafood pasta)

1585
01:01:05,843 --> 01:01:08,476
(Fillet mignon, seafood pasta, lobster salad)

1586
01:01:08,476 --> 01:01:11,543
And look at the portions.

1587
01:01:11,543 --> 01:01:13,009
Wow, just wow.

1588
01:01:13,609 --> 01:01:15,443
It really looks awesome.

1589
01:01:16,409 --> 01:01:18,276
This place is amazing.

1590
01:01:18,276 --> 01:01:20,843
We can't copy those reactions.

1591
01:01:21,809 --> 01:01:23,809
Look how much seafood is here.

1592
01:01:23,809 --> 01:01:25,809
Is this all lobster?

1593
01:01:26,743 --> 01:01:28,409
Hey, it's all lobster down here.

1594
01:01:29,143 --> 01:01:31,476
- Let's jump in. / - Shall we eat?

1595
01:01:32,143 --> 01:01:33,276
I want to try this.

1596
01:01:34,509 --> 01:01:36,109
A cream tomato sauce.

1597
01:01:45,376 --> 01:01:47,843
It's good.

1598
01:01:50,276 --> 01:01:51,843
This is really delicious.

1599
01:01:52,576 --> 01:01:54,476
- Yura, look at this shrimp. / - Dip it in this.

1600
01:01:54,476 --> 01:01:56,343
- I know. / - Look how big it is.

1601
01:01:59,676 --> 01:02:00,809
Wow.

1602
01:02:01,909 --> 01:02:05,209
(Big bites)

1603
01:02:06,209 --> 01:02:08,543
The meat is so plump.

1604
01:02:09,409 --> 01:02:13,109
I wish we had this place in Korea. I'd come so often.

1605
01:02:13,643 --> 01:02:19,009
(Since it's not in Korea, I'll eat a lot before I go)

1606
01:02:19,676 --> 01:02:21,709
They put so much lobster in here.

1607
01:02:22,343 --> 01:02:24,309
I think they put a whole lobster in here.

1608
01:02:28,976 --> 01:02:31,476
(A bite with lobster and avocado)

1609
01:02:32,609 --> 01:02:34,309
(Goodness)

1610
01:02:34,576 --> 01:02:37,276
Eat it with avocado. It's really delicious.

1611
01:02:37,276 --> 01:02:38,809
It's great. Eat it with this sauce.

1612
01:02:38,809 --> 01:02:39,876
Dip it in this.

1613
01:02:39,876 --> 01:02:42,376
- That sauce was really great. / - It's the best.

1614
01:02:48,043 --> 01:02:49,076
It's really delicious, right?

1615
01:02:49,876 --> 01:02:51,276
The sauce is fantastic.

1616
01:02:51,276 --> 01:02:53,376
It tastes great with sauce.

1617
01:02:53,809 --> 01:02:55,143
It's so delicious.

1618
01:02:55,943 --> 01:02:56,876
It goes so well together.

1619
01:02:56,876 --> 01:02:59,243
The lobster, avocado and sauce.

1620
01:03:06,409 --> 01:03:08,943
(Yum)

1621
01:03:08,943 --> 01:03:09,909
It's so good.

1622
01:03:10,576 --> 01:03:14,009
I'm so happy. I'll make the most of today.

1623
01:03:14,843 --> 01:03:16,376
We had fun today.

1624
01:03:16,376 --> 01:03:17,676
How much fun are we going to have tomorrow?

1625
01:03:17,676 --> 01:03:18,943
Let's eat even better food tomorrow.

1626
01:03:18,943 --> 01:03:20,409
- And have more fun. / - Okay.

1627
01:03:21,143 --> 01:03:23,309
I heard Orange County is nice.

1628
01:03:23,309 --> 01:03:26,843
I heard that area is famous for surfing.

1629
01:03:26,843 --> 01:03:28,009
Are we going to see the beach now?

1630
01:03:28,009 --> 01:03:30,543
- Huntington Beach is... / - Hunting?

1631
01:03:30,543 --> 01:03:32,609
- You mean that hunting? / - That hunting, she says.

1632
01:03:32,609 --> 01:03:34,876
That's why I learn English.

1633
01:03:37,143 --> 01:03:38,676
I heard really famous people

1634
01:03:38,676 --> 01:03:39,909
come here for surfing.

1635
01:03:39,909 --> 01:03:41,809
We can see Hollywood stars here.

1636
01:03:41,809 --> 01:03:42,943
We can pretend we know them.

1637
01:03:42,943 --> 01:03:44,609
- We'll say we're Korean stars. / - Sure.

1638
01:03:44,609 --> 01:03:46,509
Would they pick us up?

1639
01:03:46,909 --> 01:03:48,309
(She's embarrassed)

1640
01:03:48,309 --> 01:03:49,409
So similar.

1641
01:03:49,409 --> 01:03:51,476
That's why this is called Huntington Beach.

1642
01:03:51,476 --> 01:03:53,943
- We must go. / - It's not just any beach.

1643
01:03:53,943 --> 01:03:55,609
- We must go there. / - Yeah.

1644
01:03:56,776 --> 01:04:00,776
(Surfing at Huntington Beach)

1645
01:04:00,776 --> 01:04:02,909
They really had a packed schedule.

1646
01:04:02,909 --> 01:04:06,376
As it's our last day, let's do some surfing.

1647
01:04:06,376 --> 01:04:08,309
I've really been looking forward to it.

1648
01:04:08,309 --> 01:04:11,343
Santa Monica Beach,

1649
01:04:11,343 --> 01:04:13,643
Malibu Beach and Venice Beach...

1650
01:04:13,643 --> 01:04:15,309
- Are very famous. / - Right.

1651
01:04:15,309 --> 01:04:19,576
- Huntington Beach is most famous for surfing. / - I see.

1652
01:04:19,576 --> 01:04:21,276
It has 100 years of history.

1653
01:04:23,643 --> 01:04:26,576
(Huntington Beach is located in the south)

1654
01:04:26,576 --> 01:04:28,576
The view is the best.

1655
01:04:28,576 --> 01:04:29,509
It's so big.

1656
01:04:29,509 --> 01:04:32,443
They all walk around barefoot with surfing boards.

1657
01:04:34,643 --> 01:04:35,376
(Huntington Beach)

1658
01:04:35,376 --> 01:04:36,643
(Can't get better surfing conditions than this)

1659
01:04:36,643 --> 01:04:37,876
(From beginners to experts, they can all have fun here)

1660
01:04:42,543 --> 01:04:45,743
(How good is Yul Bang Tour's surfing skills?)

1661
01:04:48,209 --> 01:04:49,343
Here we are.

1662
01:04:51,109 --> 01:04:52,209
Heave.

1663
01:04:53,876 --> 01:04:56,076
(Where are we?)

1664
01:04:57,509 --> 01:04:58,409
Come here.

1665
01:04:58,409 --> 01:05:00,409
I reserved a surfing school.

1666
01:05:00,409 --> 01:05:02,976
- Really? / - We'll rent wetsuits here...

1667
01:05:02,976 --> 01:05:05,643
- And learn how to surf. / - Okay.

1668
01:05:05,643 --> 01:05:08,176
- Let's go. / - Let's go surfing.

1669
01:05:08,176 --> 01:05:09,309
- Yul. / - Bang.

1670
01:05:09,309 --> 01:05:10,309
Tour.

1671
01:05:10,309 --> 01:05:12,276
- Let's go. / - Let's go.

1672
01:05:12,876 --> 01:05:15,043
- Surfing school. / - Can't wait!

1673
01:05:16,743 --> 01:05:21,009
(You can rent a board, suit and safety equipment)

1674
01:05:23,243 --> 01:05:25,843
- Let's get changed and go surfing. / - Let's go!

1675
01:05:25,843 --> 01:05:28,776
- Let's go! / - I guess we must wear this.

1676
01:05:32,243 --> 01:05:33,509
What is this?

1677
01:05:35,876 --> 01:05:37,143
What is this?

1678
01:05:39,676 --> 01:05:42,143
(Suddenly there's strong wind)

1679
01:05:42,843 --> 01:05:45,309
- The weather. / - It was so.

1680
01:05:45,309 --> 01:05:46,476
I thought a typhoon was coming.

1681
01:05:46,476 --> 01:05:47,943
That...

1682
01:05:50,876 --> 01:05:53,976
(Will Yul Bang Tour get to surf today?)

1683
01:05:55,043 --> 01:05:58,143
(The surfing beginners come for their lesson)

1684
01:05:58,576 --> 01:06:00,943
Whether you're scared, cold, or warm,

1685
01:06:00,943 --> 01:06:02,443
you're going to be smiling and have fun.

1686
01:06:02,443 --> 01:06:03,143
Throw a shock in.

1687
01:06:03,143 --> 01:06:03,576
Okay.

1688
01:06:03,576 --> 01:06:05,843
You know what a shock is? Right there, yeah.

1689
01:06:05,843 --> 01:06:08,376
You're the only two surfing on the beach right now?

1690
01:06:11,043 --> 01:06:13,476
(The instructor demonstrates first)

1691
01:06:14,443 --> 01:06:18,343
(Don't want to be too far back or forward)

1692
01:06:19,243 --> 01:06:22,209
(Feet always at the back of the board)

1693
01:06:23,109 --> 01:06:25,476
(Big paddle movements with both arms)

1694
01:06:26,276 --> 01:06:27,976
(Big like this)

1695
01:06:29,009 --> 01:06:34,076
(Put your hands under your chest and stand up)

1696
01:06:34,443 --> 01:06:35,376
Okay!

1697
01:06:37,709 --> 01:06:39,109
Feet back.

1698
01:06:39,109 --> 01:06:41,409
Arms like this...

1699
01:06:43,576 --> 01:06:44,376
Hop up.

1700
01:06:44,909 --> 01:06:47,443
(Grab the board and hop up)

1701
01:06:49,209 --> 01:06:52,076
- They teach it in one go. / - Are they doing martial arts?

1702
01:06:52,376 --> 01:06:55,343
- It's like Bruce Lee. / - I stood up in one go so...

1703
01:06:55,876 --> 01:06:58,376
(Practicing like it's the real deal)

1704
01:07:01,076 --> 01:07:02,676
(Clapping)

1705
01:07:03,276 --> 01:07:04,776
It's easy.

1706
01:07:06,276 --> 01:07:08,609
I really wanted to learn surfing.

1707
01:07:08,609 --> 01:07:09,943
Was it fun?

1708
01:07:09,943 --> 01:07:11,243
It was really fun.

1709
01:07:13,509 --> 01:07:15,909
But isn't it hard to stand on your first day?

1710
01:07:15,909 --> 01:07:17,243
Right.

1711
01:07:18,709 --> 01:07:19,976
It's dangerous.

1712
01:07:21,443 --> 01:07:22,276
Heads up.

1713
01:07:23,776 --> 01:07:25,809
- Alright, lay down. / - Is it Minah's turn?

1714
01:07:25,809 --> 01:07:27,209
Here comes the wave.

1715
01:07:28,209 --> 01:07:31,009
(Wave is coming right after she gets on the board)

1716
01:07:31,009 --> 01:07:33,443
(She passes the first wave)

1717
01:07:34,076 --> 01:07:36,976
(She passes the second wave)

1718
01:07:37,776 --> 01:07:39,243
The waves are big.

1719
01:07:39,909 --> 01:07:43,343
Here it comes again.

1720
01:07:43,343 --> 01:07:44,976
(Waves come often in a variety of heights)

1721
01:07:44,976 --> 01:07:46,543
(You can choose the right wave for you)

1722
01:07:48,843 --> 01:07:50,576
(After passing the third wave)

1723
01:07:50,576 --> 01:07:52,776
(That's our wave!)

1724
01:07:53,643 --> 01:07:56,709
- Paddle, paddle. / - Let's stand up right away.

1725
01:07:57,009 --> 01:08:00,009
- Paddle, paddle. / - Let's stand up right away.

1726
01:08:00,443 --> 01:08:00,943
Can she do it?

1727
01:08:00,943 --> 01:08:03,909
(First ever surfing in her 26 years of life)

1728
01:08:04,809 --> 01:08:08,576
(Can Minah succeed?)

1729
01:08:08,576 --> 01:08:11,043
- Hey, I think she can do it. / - Since she's light.

1730
01:08:11,043 --> 01:08:12,409
- Will she? / - She's standing, she's standing.

1731
01:08:17,043 --> 01:08:18,643
Goodness.

1732
01:08:19,876 --> 01:08:20,643
No way!

1733
01:08:21,876 --> 01:08:22,909
I crashed right away.

1734
01:08:24,376 --> 01:08:25,176
No way!

1735
01:08:26,009 --> 01:08:29,543
(Stands up for a second)

1736
01:08:30,176 --> 01:08:32,209
- That's really good. / - Isn't that hard, Hwijae?

1737
01:08:32,209 --> 01:08:34,609
- She's really good. / - Really?

1738
01:08:34,609 --> 01:08:36,509
- Did you really get up on your first try? / - Yes.

1739
01:08:36,509 --> 01:08:38,843
- First time. / - It's because she's light.

1740
01:08:38,843 --> 01:08:40,676
I thought he taught her half-heartedly

1741
01:08:40,676 --> 01:08:42,143
but he must be a great teacher.

1742
01:08:42,143 --> 01:08:44,376
Look how happy he is for her.

1743
01:08:45,043 --> 01:08:47,143
(Good job)

1744
01:08:48,676 --> 01:08:51,709
(It's Yura's turn now)

1745
01:08:52,109 --> 01:08:53,176
Come on.

1746
01:08:53,176 --> 01:08:54,476
(Get on)

1747
01:08:54,509 --> 01:08:56,209
Lay down. You can do it.

1748
01:08:58,043 --> 01:08:59,109
All the way.

1749
01:09:00,443 --> 01:09:01,409
On your stomach.

1750
01:09:02,009 --> 01:09:06,609
(The waves attack her two times in a row)

1751
01:09:07,043 --> 01:09:08,909
(Argh)

1752
01:09:08,909 --> 01:09:10,709
(Another wave is coming!)

1753
01:09:12,009 --> 01:09:14,543
(Screaming)

1754
01:09:15,509 --> 01:09:16,876
(Relaxed because she's been through it)

1755
01:09:17,043 --> 01:09:18,376
What's up with your hair?

1756
01:09:19,509 --> 01:09:20,709
Did it freeze?

1757
01:09:21,309 --> 01:09:24,276
(She gets ready for the wave)

1758
01:09:26,676 --> 01:09:27,976
Stand up, stand up.

1759
01:09:29,643 --> 01:09:31,309
- Let's do this! / - Come on!

1760
01:09:33,743 --> 01:09:38,309
(Can Yura overcome her fear and stand up?)

1761
01:09:39,943 --> 01:09:41,676
Get up, please!

1762
01:09:43,576 --> 01:09:45,443
That's wrong, isn't it?

1763
01:09:49,809 --> 01:09:51,343
She reached the beach.

1764
01:09:52,876 --> 01:09:54,609
Hands up!

1765
01:09:55,543 --> 01:09:58,443
- It was too shallow. / - Yes. It was the shore.

1766
01:09:58,443 --> 01:10:00,643
(Couldn't stand up)

1767
01:10:03,376 --> 01:10:04,709
Minah's excited.

1768
01:10:05,176 --> 01:10:06,776
I really wanted to try this.

1769
01:10:09,809 --> 01:10:11,276
Are you ready? Ready, ready?

1770
01:10:11,276 --> 01:10:13,543
Paddle, paddle.

1771
01:10:17,976 --> 01:10:19,276
She's good.

1772
01:10:20,276 --> 01:10:21,843
That's very good.

1773
01:10:29,643 --> 01:10:34,843
(They enjoy the surf despite the bad weather)

1774
01:10:36,543 --> 01:10:37,743
Stand up.

1775
01:10:42,709 --> 01:10:44,209
(They fall and fall again but enjoy the surf)

1776
01:10:44,743 --> 01:10:46,243
She fell right off.

1777
01:11:00,476 --> 01:11:02,843
You must've eaten so much after that.

1778
01:11:02,843 --> 01:11:05,443
Yeah. That expends so much energy.

1779
01:11:06,876 --> 01:11:09,909
- Now that we've surfed, let's eat. / - "Let's eat."

1780
01:11:09,909 --> 01:11:12,509
- Look. / - We got hungry.

1781
01:11:12,509 --> 01:11:15,209
- You get hungry after a swim. / - You do.

1782
01:11:16,576 --> 01:11:18,009
What are they going to eat?

1783
01:11:21,843 --> 01:11:22,843
Let's go eat.

1784
01:11:22,843 --> 01:11:25,009
I'm so hungry after playing.

1785
01:11:25,009 --> 01:11:28,609
Today, we're going to a local spot in Orange County.

1786
01:11:30,109 --> 01:11:32,643
- This is the place. / - Is it here?

1787
01:11:32,643 --> 01:11:34,409
I heard this place is really popular.

1788
01:11:34,409 --> 01:11:36,609
According to the reviews, it's really good here.

1789
01:11:36,609 --> 01:11:38,376
I'm hungry. I'm so hungry.

1790
01:11:39,509 --> 01:11:42,009
(Have you heard of chicken waffle?)

1791
01:11:42,909 --> 01:11:45,476
(Everyone loves chicken waffle)

1792
01:11:46,043 --> 01:11:47,976
(Looks so appetizing)

1793
01:11:48,309 --> 01:11:49,909
Waffle chicken?

1794
01:11:51,976 --> 01:11:53,709
What is that?

1795
01:11:54,509 --> 01:11:55,709
Mac and cheese.

1796
01:11:55,709 --> 01:11:57,709
- This was really... / - It's interesting.

1797
01:11:58,376 --> 01:11:59,943
There's no need for words.

1798
01:12:00,876 --> 01:12:03,143
- It's impossible to taste bad. / - It's moist inside.

1799
01:12:03,143 --> 01:12:06,976
This place is popular among surfers.

1800
01:12:06,976 --> 01:12:10,176
- Really? / - So after they surf...

1801
01:12:10,176 --> 01:12:12,143
They come here to eat.

1802
01:12:12,143 --> 01:12:13,376
It looks so good.

1803
01:12:13,376 --> 01:12:15,843
Those pictures make my mouth water.

1804
01:12:15,843 --> 01:12:17,509
- The egg looks amazing. / - Exactly.

1805
01:12:18,109 --> 01:12:19,109
- There it is. / - It's coming.

1806
01:12:21,576 --> 01:12:22,376
Amazing.

1807
01:12:23,076 --> 01:12:24,243
Thank you!

1808
01:12:25,709 --> 01:12:26,743
This is amazing.

1809
01:12:26,743 --> 01:12:28,176
It looks so tasty.

1810
01:12:30,876 --> 01:12:33,943
- It looks really amazing. / - I want to eat it again.

1811
01:12:33,943 --> 01:12:35,509
- It looks really amazing. / - It does.

1812
01:12:39,276 --> 01:12:40,676
That waffle looks great.

1813
01:12:41,309 --> 01:12:42,443
Look at the egg yolk.

1814
01:12:43,843 --> 01:12:45,209
It was amazing.

1815
01:12:46,143 --> 01:12:47,576
This is what you like.

1816
01:12:47,576 --> 01:12:50,443
- The crispy part? / - You'll totally love it.

1817
01:12:50,443 --> 01:12:52,943
(Crispy)

1818
01:12:52,943 --> 01:12:54,076
- Look at her face. / - You like these parts.

1819
01:12:54,909 --> 01:12:56,509
This looks amazing.

1820
01:12:56,509 --> 01:12:58,243
It looks really amazing. It looks so delicious.

1821
01:12:58,843 --> 01:13:00,876
Yura's in a hurry. She can't wait.

1822
01:13:01,343 --> 01:13:04,276
There's bacon and cheese.

1823
01:13:04,276 --> 01:13:06,409
This can't taste bad.

1824
01:13:07,176 --> 01:13:09,109
I'll add maple syrup.

1825
01:13:09,109 --> 01:13:11,843
You have to soak it in the syrup.

1826
01:13:11,843 --> 01:13:13,276
You pour maple syrup on that?

1827
01:13:13,276 --> 01:13:15,776
- That makes it good. / - You need the syrup.

1828
01:13:15,776 --> 01:13:17,776
Minah's eating well again.

1829
01:13:17,776 --> 01:13:19,809
You have to let go of your diet there.

1830
01:13:19,809 --> 01:13:21,743
I thought that was Moon Seyoon.

1831
01:13:21,743 --> 01:13:23,809
See the way she shoved it in with her fork?

1832
01:13:23,809 --> 01:13:25,543
It was so good.

1833
01:13:26,043 --> 01:13:28,243
They eat well. It's appetizing.

1834
01:13:29,609 --> 01:13:31,609
(It's delicious as expected)

1835
01:13:31,609 --> 01:13:33,409
She really likes it.

1836
01:13:33,409 --> 01:13:35,676
- Her eyes are widen. / - So happy.

1837
01:13:35,676 --> 01:13:38,143
- This is amazing. It's so good. / - It's so delicious.

1838
01:13:38,143 --> 01:13:39,443
This is insane.

1839
01:13:39,443 --> 01:13:41,043
This is perfect to my taste.

1840
01:13:41,043 --> 01:13:43,809
I really love crispy textures.

1841
01:13:43,809 --> 01:13:46,243
The batter and waffle are so crispy,

1842
01:13:46,243 --> 01:13:47,909
and the chicken is so tender.

1843
01:13:47,909 --> 01:13:49,809
This is the kind of texture I love.

1844
01:13:51,276 --> 01:13:53,209
I can see why this is a popular restaurant.

1845
01:13:53,209 --> 01:13:54,409
It's really good.

1846
01:13:54,409 --> 01:13:56,109
It tastes better with the syrup.

1847
01:13:58,843 --> 01:14:01,343
This is the best example of a sweet and salty dish.

1848
01:14:02,043 --> 01:14:03,309
It's so delicious.

1849
01:14:04,609 --> 01:14:06,109
I want to try the next dish.

1850
01:14:06,976 --> 01:14:08,976
(It's the signature menu of this restaurant)

1851
01:14:10,043 --> 01:14:14,343
(Original chicken waffle)

1852
01:14:15,376 --> 01:14:18,143
(It has salad in it to make it less greasy)

1853
01:14:18,976 --> 01:14:24,076
(How does it taste?)

1854
01:14:24,909 --> 01:14:27,576
The chicken is different. It's a different kind of chicken.

1855
01:14:27,576 --> 01:14:29,576
This is like chicken breast.

1856
01:14:29,576 --> 01:14:31,109
Cajun salad.

1857
01:14:31,709 --> 01:14:34,809
- This is good too. / - It's good too.

1858
01:14:34,809 --> 01:14:36,643
This makes no sense.

1859
01:14:39,043 --> 01:14:41,409
- Goodness, she wants to eat it all. / - Yeah.

1860
01:14:41,409 --> 01:14:43,476
Yura can fit it all in.

1861
01:14:43,476 --> 01:14:44,876
- Yura fits it all. / - I'm jealous.

1862
01:14:44,876 --> 01:14:46,709
A senior of eating well.

1863
01:14:49,576 --> 01:14:50,943
It's so good.

1864
01:14:51,843 --> 01:14:52,843
It's so good.

1865
01:14:54,643 --> 01:14:56,543
She eats so well.

1866
01:14:56,543 --> 01:14:58,343
How do you eat so well?

1867
01:14:58,343 --> 01:15:00,943
- It's even more fascinating in person. / - I bet.

1868
01:15:00,943 --> 01:15:02,809
(They continued to eat well)

1869
01:15:03,576 --> 01:15:06,976
- I think I'll miss this food. / - I'm sure I will.

1870
01:15:07,676 --> 01:15:11,776
I heard Huntington Beach is very famous for

1871
01:15:11,776 --> 01:15:13,143
the sunset view.

1872
01:15:13,143 --> 01:15:16,743
- While enjoying a cocktail... / - Sounds good.

1873
01:15:16,743 --> 01:15:18,043
What are we doing? Let's go.

1874
01:15:18,043 --> 01:15:19,409
We have to go before the sun sets.

1875
01:15:19,409 --> 01:15:20,743
Let me eat this first.

1876
01:15:20,743 --> 01:15:22,043
Are you not done yet?

1877
01:15:24,843 --> 01:15:30,343
(Sunset)

1878
01:15:30,543 --> 01:15:33,509
(It's their last evening in California)

1879
01:15:33,976 --> 01:15:35,243
The day in California...

1880
01:15:35,243 --> 01:15:38,476
- This is a typical view of California. / - It's the end.

1881
01:15:38,476 --> 01:15:41,509
This is a cafe inside a hotel

1882
01:15:41,509 --> 01:15:45,509
but it's the best place to see the sunset.

1883
01:15:45,509 --> 01:15:47,909
To the last night.

1884
01:15:52,909 --> 01:15:55,043
This is such a pretty picture.

1885
01:15:55,043 --> 01:15:56,276
Unbelievable.

1886
01:15:56,276 --> 01:16:00,409
- I see why people say it's nice here. / - Right?

1887
01:16:00,409 --> 01:16:03,609
- You can really enjoy the sunset. / - Yeah.

1888
01:16:04,709 --> 01:16:06,943
- It looks so pretty right now. / - So pretty.

1889
01:16:06,943 --> 01:16:08,209
I want to go there again.

1890
01:16:08,209 --> 01:16:09,943
This place was so beautiful.

1891
01:16:10,609 --> 01:16:14,876
(They realize their trip is coming to an end)

1892
01:16:15,276 --> 01:16:18,443
I'm sure the guys are enjoying San Francisco.

1893
01:16:18,443 --> 01:16:20,176
I wonder how it was in San Francisco.

1894
01:16:20,176 --> 01:16:22,209
They finally remembered them.

1895
01:16:22,709 --> 01:16:25,243
I liked that too...

1896
01:16:25,243 --> 01:16:27,309
When we visited Arts District...

1897
01:16:27,309 --> 01:16:28,509
That place was so good.

1898
01:16:28,509 --> 01:16:31,943
It was great to experience the artist's town.

1899
01:16:31,943 --> 01:16:35,176
Then just 2 hours away,

1900
01:16:35,176 --> 01:16:38,543
you can enjoy nature in Palm Springs.

1901
01:16:38,543 --> 01:16:42,409
The fact that you can enjoy both

1902
01:16:42,409 --> 01:16:44,576
is a real advantage of this place.

1903
01:16:44,576 --> 01:16:45,743
You can see the happiness on their faces.

1904
01:16:45,743 --> 01:16:48,209
We experienced both the city...

1905
01:16:48,209 --> 01:16:49,909
- And the nature here. / - Right.

1906
01:16:50,443 --> 01:16:52,176
The sun has set.

1907
01:16:52,176 --> 01:16:54,209
Is the Yul Bang Tour over now?

1908
01:16:54,209 --> 01:16:56,576
- Is it over? / - I feel so sad.

1909
01:16:56,576 --> 01:16:59,343
It's too sad.

1910
01:16:59,343 --> 01:17:01,209
I want to stay longer.

1911
01:17:01,209 --> 01:17:02,509
Seriously.

1912
01:17:03,409 --> 01:17:04,143
It was fun.

1913
01:17:04,143 --> 01:17:07,243
- Yul... / - Yul...

1914
01:17:07,243 --> 01:17:09,076
- Yul. Bang! Argh! / - Argh!

1915
01:17:09,643 --> 01:17:11,343
Thank you, California.

1916
01:17:11,343 --> 01:17:12,943
We'll come back next time.

1917
01:17:18,109 --> 01:17:20,776
- I want to go there too. / - After watching it...

1918
01:17:20,776 --> 01:17:23,743
How was it, California expert, Donggeun?

1919
01:17:23,743 --> 01:17:25,043
- Well... / - Please be objective.

1920
01:17:25,043 --> 01:17:26,943
I didn't know you could ride ATV in Palm Springs.

1921
01:17:26,943 --> 01:17:28,876
I found that out today.

1922
01:17:28,876 --> 01:17:30,076
Did you know about the horseback riding?

1923
01:17:30,076 --> 01:17:33,376
Not many people think of horse riding there.

1924
01:17:33,376 --> 01:17:34,609
- Right? / - And...

1925
01:17:34,609 --> 01:17:37,109
They go to concerts and stuff.

1926
01:17:37,109 --> 01:17:40,309
They visited many places people don't know.

1927
01:17:40,309 --> 01:17:42,576
The atmosphere is really good right now.

1928
01:17:42,576 --> 01:17:44,176
But it's time to check out the costs.

1929
01:17:44,176 --> 01:17:45,409
I'm so curious about how much it cost.

1930
01:17:45,409 --> 01:17:47,476
- It feels a little expensive. / - For us...

1931
01:17:47,476 --> 01:17:50,776
- Northern California was... / - $817.50

1932
01:17:50,776 --> 01:17:52,109
For 3 days and 2 nights.

1933
01:17:52,109 --> 01:17:55,843
Yura, how much did you spend in Southern California?

1934
01:17:55,843 --> 01:17:57,376
- The total cost... / - It's going to be expensive.

1935
01:17:57,376 --> 01:17:58,309
- The total cost? / - The cost?

1936
01:17:58,309 --> 01:17:59,843
Per person.

1937
01:18:00,676 --> 01:18:03,476
$623.

1938
01:18:04,243 --> 01:18:05,276
We did it.

1939
01:18:05,676 --> 01:18:07,576
- We won. / - We did it.

1940
01:18:07,576 --> 01:18:10,176
- We've won if it's $600. / - We went on a cruise.

1941
01:18:10,176 --> 01:18:12,509
- Had a course meal, surfed. / - We won.

1942
01:18:12,509 --> 01:18:14,209
Unlimited champagne.

1943
01:18:16,009 --> 01:18:18,343
Please be impartial in your voting, everyone.

1944
01:18:18,343 --> 01:18:19,609
Will you travel to Southern California

1945
01:18:19,609 --> 01:18:21,276
according to the Yul Bang Tour? Yes or no?

1946
01:18:21,276 --> 01:18:23,176
Please vote.

1947
01:18:24,409 --> 01:18:26,243
(Yul Bang Tour planned a trip to Southern California)

1948
01:18:26,243 --> 01:18:30,176
(What will the judges choose?)

1949
01:18:31,309 --> 01:18:33,876
Time to check the final votes.

1950
01:18:33,876 --> 01:18:37,709
Will it be the Cluck Cluck Tour that

1951
01:18:37,709 --> 01:18:40,876
basked in the magnificence of nature?

1952
01:18:40,876 --> 01:18:42,643
Will it be the Yul Bang Tour that

1953
01:18:42,643 --> 01:18:47,576
experienced new joys of the Southern California.

1954
01:18:47,576 --> 01:18:49,409
What did the judges choose?

1955
01:18:49,809 --> 01:18:50,743
This is our score.

1956
01:18:50,743 --> 01:18:51,876
Here we go.

1957
01:18:51,876 --> 01:18:53,343
The left is our score.

1958
01:18:53,343 --> 01:18:55,009
- The left. / - That's right.

1959
01:18:55,776 --> 01:18:57,609
- This really makes you nervous. / - Right?

1960
01:18:57,609 --> 01:18:59,609
- It's nothing really but you get nervous. / - Why?

1961
01:19:00,376 --> 01:19:02,243
- Is there a punishment? / - No punishment.

1962
01:19:02,243 --> 01:19:04,776
No punishment.

1963
01:19:04,776 --> 01:19:06,143
- 1 vote. / - Got it.

1964
01:19:06,509 --> 01:19:07,609
- Really? / - What's going on?

1965
01:19:07,609 --> 01:19:09,643
- No punishment. / - 1 vote!

1966
01:19:09,643 --> 01:19:10,809
Got it.

1967
01:19:10,809 --> 01:19:12,176
- Really? / - What the?

1968
01:19:12,176 --> 01:19:13,943
- 1 vote. / - Got it.

1969
01:19:13,943 --> 01:19:15,076
- For real? / - What's going on?

1970
01:19:15,076 --> 01:19:18,143
- It must be a big difference. / - More, more.

1971
01:19:18,143 --> 01:19:18,976
- No. / - We won.

1972
01:19:18,976 --> 01:19:20,143
- What if it's a tie? / - I want to win.

1973
01:19:20,143 --> 01:19:25,043

1974
01:19:26,843 --> 01:19:27,843
I want to win.

01:19:27,843 --> 01:19:31,143
(Southern California wins!)

1976
01:19:31,143 --> 01:19:33,876
Thank you.

1977
01:19:33,876 --> 01:19:36,409
We beat San Francisco!

1978
01:19:36,943 --> 01:19:38,576
- Good work. / - What a shame.

1979
01:19:39,476 --> 01:19:41,209
I had goose bumps.

1980
01:19:41,209 --> 01:19:45,109
The first half vote stayed the same.

1981
01:19:45,109 --> 01:19:46,943
Did we do something really wrong?

1982
01:19:46,943 --> 01:19:48,776
No, that's not it.

1983
01:19:48,776 --> 01:19:50,643
- Girl's Day just did much better. / - They did.

1984
01:19:51,109 --> 01:19:53,376
I think we were able to understand

1985
01:19:53,376 --> 01:19:56,843
the difference between San Francisco and L.A.

1986
01:19:56,843 --> 01:19:58,443
If you get the time...

1987
01:19:58,443 --> 01:20:01,943
- Go to both. / - Go here then here.

1988
01:20:01,943 --> 01:20:03,709

Watching the two teams travel today,

1991
01:20:09,309 --> 01:20:10,743
I realized how wonderful California was.

1992
01:20:10,743 --> 01:20:13,843
The fact that I lived there...

1993
01:20:13,843 --> 01:20:15,743
- Thank you. / - We'll call you for California...

1994
01:20:15,743 --> 01:20:17,409
- So always be ready. / - Yes.

1995
01:20:17,409 --> 01:20:19,909
The past two weeks were in California.

1996
01:20:19,909 --> 01:20:21,576
What do we do?

1997
01:20:21,576 --> 01:20:23,176
Next week, it's Europe.

1998
01:20:23,176 --> 01:20:24,443
Wow.

1999
01:20:24,443 --> 01:20:26,143
- Where are we going? / - England.

2000
01:20:27,009 --> 01:20:28,509
It's England, everyone.

2001
01:20:28,943 --> 01:20:30,609
Please look forward to it.

2002
01:20:30,609 --> 01:20:33,043

2005
01:20:40,609 --> 01:20:42,009
How is this possible?

2006
01:20:42,009 --> 01:20:44,343
This is brown...

2007
01:20:44,776 --> 01:20:46,543
This place is awesome.

2008
01:20:47,676 --> 01:20:49,676
Unbelievable.

2009
01:20:49,676 --> 01:20:51,643
We're finally here.

2010
01:20:52,643 --> 01:20:53,743
Let's go!
