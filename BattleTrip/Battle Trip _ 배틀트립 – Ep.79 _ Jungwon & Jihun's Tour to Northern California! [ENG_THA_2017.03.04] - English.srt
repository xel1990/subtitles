(Lee Hwijae, special host, Han Donggeun)

00:00:07,343 --> 00:00:08,510
(Kim Sook, Sung Sikyung)

4
00:00:09,943 --> 00:00:11,210
Travel is war!

5
00:00:11,210 --> 00:00:13,610
Battle Trip!

6
00:00:15,843 --> 00:00:18,343
Today's special host for Battle Trip

7
00:00:18,343 --> 00:00:19,476
is extremely nervous.

8
00:00:19,476 --> 00:00:20,943
It's singer Han Donggeun!

9
00:00:21,743 --> 00:00:24,043
Hello, I'm today's special host,

10
00:00:24,043 --> 00:00:26,176
singer Han Donggeun.

11
00:00:26,176 --> 00:00:26,610
It's nice to meet you.

12
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:27,910
Nice to meet you.

13
00:00:28,443 --> 00:00:29,910
Yes, Han Donggeun.

14
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:31,743
He's such a good singer.

15
00:00:31,743 --> 00:00:34,243
- He can start singing at any minute. / - Thank you.

16
00:00:34,243 --> 00:00:35,743
- Really? / - Yes.

17
00:00:35,743 --> 00:00:37,576
Do you like to travel?

18
00:00:39,076 --> 00:00:41,176
I do like to travel

19
00:00:41,176 --> 00:00:42,910
but I haven't traveled a lot.

20
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:44,143
So I really enjoy the show.

21
00:00:44,143 --> 00:00:45,443
What was your favorite?

22
00:00:45,443 --> 00:00:46,810
Where did you want to go the most

23
00:00:46,810 --> 00:00:48,010
when you watched Battle Trip?

24
00:00:48,010 --> 00:00:49,643
The place Shin Dong went to.

25
00:00:49,643 --> 00:00:50,643
- Shin Dong? / - China?

26
00:00:50,643 --> 00:00:53,976
The place you could take home wine in your bottle.

27
00:00:54,610 --> 00:00:56,410
You like to drink.

28
00:00:56,410 --> 00:00:57,910
I see.

29
00:00:59,176 --> 00:01:01,176
This is good.

30
00:01:01,176 --> 00:01:02,443
We like this sort of thing.

31
00:01:02,876 --> 00:01:04,343
I like his smile.

32
00:01:04,343 --> 00:01:07,076
There's a reason why Donggeun's the guest today.

33
00:01:07,076 --> 00:01:09,343
In fact, he has something to do with today's trip.

34
00:01:09,343 --> 00:01:10,776
- Is that right? / - Yes.

35
00:01:10,776 --> 00:01:11,643
Why?

36
00:01:11,643 --> 00:01:13,676
The thing is

37
00:01:13,676 --> 00:01:15,743
I was an overseas student there

38
00:01:15,743 --> 00:01:17,843
for 4 years.

39
00:01:17,843 --> 00:01:20,310
Can you introduce

40
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:22,610
today's destination in their language?

41
00:01:22,610 --> 00:01:24,010
- That's right. / - Good things about the place.

42
00:01:27,110 --> 00:01:28,476
He's starting with "umm."

43
00:01:28,476 --> 00:01:30,410
- Umm. / - Umm.

44
00:01:31,476 --> 00:01:33,110
It's like...

45
00:01:33,110 --> 00:01:34,810
(Oh)

46
00:01:34,810 --> 00:01:35,743
Yes!

47
00:01:35,743 --> 00:01:36,610
Yes?

48
00:01:36,610 --> 00:01:38,676
That kind of place.

49
00:01:38,676 --> 00:01:39,910
It's an English-speaking country.

50
00:01:39,910 --> 00:01:40,543
- Yes. / - English-speaking country.

51
00:01:40,543 --> 00:01:41,243
And?

52
00:01:41,243 --> 00:01:43,243
It's a very warm place.

53
00:01:44,176 --> 00:01:46,376
And nearby the beach.

54
00:01:48,076 --> 00:01:49,143
Thank you very much.

55
00:01:52,576 --> 00:01:54,543
Today's destination is

56
00:01:54,543 --> 00:01:56,043
connected to Han Donggeun.

57
00:01:56,043 --> 00:01:57,676
It's California in the West America.

58
00:01:59,243 --> 00:02:01,676
- California. / - California.

59
00:02:02,710 --> 00:02:03,943
Where did you stay for 4 years?

60
00:02:04,843 --> 00:02:06,976
- Urban... / - I lived in 3 places.

61
00:02:06,976 --> 00:02:07,743
Did you cause trouble?

62
00:02:08,976 --> 00:02:10,276
- I didn't study very well. / - I see.

63
00:02:11,076 --> 00:02:12,476
- So where did you stay? / - Where?

64
00:02:12,476 --> 00:02:14,110
First, I was in Murrieta.

65
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:16,043
It's in the countryside.

66
00:02:16,043 --> 00:02:16,976
I stayed there for a while.

67
00:02:16,976 --> 00:02:19,143
- You did. / - Then I went to Fullerton.

68
00:02:19,143 --> 00:02:20,410
After Fullerton...

69
00:02:20,410 --> 00:02:21,910
I also lived in La Habra.

70
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:24,343
It's a small city near

71
00:02:24,343 --> 00:02:27,143
Diamond Bar.

72
00:02:27,143 --> 00:02:28,810
I've never been to those cities.

73
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:31,410
If you stayed in 3 cities for 4 years,

74
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:33,076
I guess you're a California expert.

75
00:02:33,076 --> 00:02:35,243
I don't think we should ask him to speak English.

76
00:02:36,743 --> 00:02:38,643
I heard today's trip designers...

77
00:02:38,643 --> 00:02:41,076
- Had a good time there. / - Right.

78
00:02:41,076 --> 00:02:41,910
Let's meet them now.

79
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:43,710
The four trip planners

80
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:46,010
who traveled to California. Come on out!

81
00:02:50,876 --> 00:02:53,043
(Choi Jungwon, Kim Jihun)

82
00:02:54,276 --> 00:02:55,543
Hello.

83
00:02:56,110 --> 00:02:59,043
Minah and Yura are in the same team.

84
00:02:59,043 --> 00:03:00,610
Jihun and Jungwon,

85
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:01,576
how did you know each other?

86
00:03:01,576 --> 00:03:02,976
We're in the same basketball team.

87
00:03:02,976 --> 00:03:05,243
- Oh, you play basketball together. / - Yes.

88
00:03:05,243 --> 00:03:07,743
Jihun, was it your first time in the U.S?

89
00:03:07,743 --> 00:03:10,010
- I've been there a few times. / - Really?

90
00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:10,876
Yes.

91
00:03:11,810 --> 00:03:14,110
What? You thought I've never been to the U.S.?

92
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:15,076
Is that how I look?

93
00:03:15,076 --> 00:03:16,643
So what did you do in California?

94
00:03:16,643 --> 00:03:18,743
L.A. is the most famous city...

95
00:03:18,743 --> 00:03:20,443
- In California. / - Right.

96
00:03:20,443 --> 00:03:23,376
But we traveled the northern part

97
00:03:23,376 --> 00:03:24,510
of California.

98
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:25,743
- So we... / - They saw the real California.

99
00:03:26,376 --> 00:03:28,276
We went to hidden tourist attractions...

100
00:03:28,943 --> 00:03:31,710
Which you haven't seen a lot before.

101
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:32,676
- You did? / - Yes.

102
00:03:33,410 --> 00:03:34,743
When you said you went to the northern part,

103
00:03:34,743 --> 00:03:35,576
Han Donggeun said

104
00:03:35,576 --> 00:03:37,276
you saw the real California.

105
00:03:37,276 --> 00:03:38,676
- Only those who know, know this. / - Yes.

106
00:03:38,676 --> 00:03:39,443
- Really? / - Yes.

107
00:03:39,443 --> 00:03:41,643
First-timers in the U.S. usually go to L.A.

108
00:03:41,643 --> 00:03:44,243
- Or places with a lot of Koreans. / - Right.

109
00:03:44,243 --> 00:03:46,410
But if you're an intermediate traveler,

110
00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:49,376
you head north, where you can experience nature.

111
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:51,376
When Yura was our special host, she said...

112
00:03:51,376 --> 00:03:52,910
- She wanted to go on a trip. / - That's right.

113
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:54,643
- And she finally went on a trip. / - Finally.

114
00:03:54,643 --> 00:03:56,976
I'm sure they will win because

115
00:03:56,976 --> 00:03:58,510
they love to eat.

116
00:03:58,510 --> 00:03:59,643
Definitely.

117
00:03:59,643 --> 00:04:01,476
We ate a lot there.

118
00:04:01,476 --> 00:04:04,143
That's the thing we remember the most.

119
00:04:04,143 --> 00:04:05,310
- We ate so much. / - This is good.

120
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:06,376
That's a successful trip.

121
00:04:06,376 --> 00:04:07,043
We ate too much.

122
00:04:07,043 --> 00:04:09,110
Did you guys hit it off during the trip?

123
00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:11,510
- Yes. We are... / - Since you're so close.

124
00:04:11,510 --> 00:04:13,943
We've been together for 9 years now.

125
00:04:13,943 --> 00:04:17,443
And we have the same taste in food.

126
00:04:17,443 --> 00:04:18,843
- We have similar tastes. / - We like the same food.

127
00:04:18,843 --> 00:04:19,610
- So... / - That's all you need.

128
00:04:19,610 --> 00:04:22,410
- We like crunchy food. / - And flour-based food.

129
00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:23,143
With egg yolk...

130
00:04:23,143 --> 00:04:24,076
Sweet and salty.

131
00:04:24,076 --> 00:04:25,410
With egg yolk...

132
00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:26,810
We eat like kids.

133
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:28,376
There was the perfect sweet-salty combination.

134
00:04:28,376 --> 00:04:29,843
- Okay. / - Normally...

135
00:04:29,843 --> 00:04:32,210
You diet but none of that today, right?

136
00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:33,576
None of that today, right?

137
00:04:33,576 --> 00:04:34,910
You can work out after you eat.

138
00:04:34,910 --> 00:04:35,843
- That's right. / - That's right.

139
00:04:35,843 --> 00:04:37,810
- You should enjoy your food there. / - Right.

140
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:39,310
- Otherwise, you'd be stressed. / - What's the point?

141
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:40,343
You can't travel then.

142
00:04:41,243 --> 00:04:43,243
We will show you the map of California.

143
00:04:43,243 --> 00:04:45,210
We need your explanation.

144
00:04:45,210 --> 00:04:46,710
Please tell us about California with the map.

145
00:04:47,543 --> 00:04:48,910
- It must be very far. / - This is Seoul.

146
00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:50,676
- There we go. / - So far.

147
00:04:51,276 --> 00:04:53,243
It's so big.

148
00:04:53,243 --> 00:04:54,543
Here's Los Angeles.

149
00:04:54,543 --> 00:04:55,676
- Palm Springs. / - Palm Springs.

150
00:04:55,676 --> 00:04:57,776
- There's Orange County. / - Orange County.

151
00:04:57,776 --> 00:04:58,910
- San Francisco. / - San Francisco.

152
00:04:58,910 --> 00:05:00,476
- It's in the northern part. / - It's much more north.

153
00:05:00,476 --> 00:05:01,310
Napa Valley.

154
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:02,976
There's Yosemite National Park.

155
00:05:02,976 --> 00:05:03,610
I've heard of that place before.

156
00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:04,643
- Yosemite. / - The U.S.

157
00:05:04,643 --> 00:05:06,576
The U.S. has huge natural areas, right?

158
00:05:06,576 --> 00:05:07,176
Right.

159
00:05:07,176 --> 00:05:09,243
They have the 3 top national parks.

160
00:05:09,243 --> 00:05:10,610
One was shown here...

161
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:11,743
- Grand Canyon. / - Okay.

162
00:05:11,743 --> 00:05:12,876
- Yellowstone. / - Okay.

163
00:05:12,876 --> 00:05:14,176
And Yosemite.

164
00:05:14,176 --> 00:05:15,076
They're the top 3?

165
00:05:15,076 --> 00:05:16,176
We went to one of them.

166
00:05:16,176 --> 00:05:18,010
The great thing about San Francisco is

167
00:05:18,010 --> 00:05:19,210
that it's always autumn weather.

168
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:21,043
- Always, right? / - Always autumn.

169
00:05:21,043 --> 00:05:24,110
The rainy season is from December to March there.

170
00:05:24,110 --> 00:05:26,210
So we were very worried about it.

171
00:05:26,210 --> 00:05:29,276
But it didn't rain even a single day.

172
00:05:29,276 --> 00:05:30,943
But when you go to Yosemite National Park,

173
00:05:30,943 --> 00:05:33,110
you can see the snow which is unbelievable.

174
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:35,676
So usually, when you go to Yosemite,

175
00:05:35,676 --> 00:05:36,910
you can see the snow...

176
00:05:36,910 --> 00:05:38,676
- And you can go skiing there. / - Right.

177
00:05:38,676 --> 00:05:41,510
But as you know, the Earth is hurting these days.

178
00:05:42,176 --> 00:05:44,243
So due to the change in weather,

179
00:05:44,243 --> 00:05:45,776
it didn't snow.

180
00:05:45,776 --> 00:05:47,610
- That's weird. / - But we saw snow.

181
00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:48,710
You saw snow?

182
00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:50,276
- Actually, we... / - In the south?

183
00:05:50,276 --> 00:05:52,343
It was actually cold for us.

184
00:05:52,343 --> 00:05:53,676
The Earth really is sick.

185
00:05:53,676 --> 00:05:55,543
- We... / - It snowed in L.A.?

186
00:05:55,543 --> 00:05:57,610
- This is so strange. / - It snowed in Palm Springs.

187
00:05:57,610 --> 00:05:59,576
That's unbelievable.

188
00:05:59,576 --> 00:06:01,043
It snowed in Palm Springs.

189
00:06:01,043 --> 00:06:03,243
We enjoyed both the city and the nature.

190
00:06:03,243 --> 00:06:05,010
- You can enjoy both. / - We experienced both.

191
00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:06,510
You can do that in Busan.

192
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:07,610
You can do that in Busan.

193
00:06:08,776 --> 00:06:10,910
- No, no. / - Excuse me. Go to Gangwon-do.

194
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:12,010
Is there a desert in Busan?

195
00:06:12,010 --> 00:06:13,276
L.A. is similar to Korea.

196
00:06:13,276 --> 00:06:14,410
You can get food delivered in L.A.

197
00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:15,210
You're spot on.

198
00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:16,776
I got soft tofu stew delivered.

199
00:06:16,776 --> 00:06:19,376
The owners ask you to order in Korean.

200
00:06:19,376 --> 00:06:21,643
They have better food there than in Korea.

201
00:06:21,643 --> 00:06:23,843
L.A. is on top of the list for cities

202
00:06:23,843 --> 00:06:25,010
Koreans love to travel to.

203
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:26,643
They go to L.A. and San Francisco.

204
00:06:26,643 --> 00:06:28,076
No, no.

205
00:06:28,076 --> 00:06:30,410
- We can confirm this on screen. / - You don't know.

206
00:06:30,410 --> 00:06:32,143
- Thing is... / - This is good. It's competitive.

207
00:06:32,143 --> 00:06:33,210
Okay.

208
00:06:33,210 --> 00:06:35,110
We have our 100 impartial judges

209
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:36,743
who will vote on today's trips.

210
00:06:36,743 --> 00:06:38,076
- Welcome. / - Nice to meet you.

211
00:06:39,976 --> 00:06:42,976
The trips will be divided into two halves.

212
00:06:42,976 --> 00:06:45,376
You'll vote once after each half.

213
00:06:45,376 --> 00:06:46,843
That's four votes in total.

214
00:06:46,843 --> 00:06:47,810
The votes aren't totaled.

215
00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:50,676
Only the vote in the second half is the final vote.

216
00:06:50,676 --> 00:06:52,010
Why don't we start?

217
00:06:52,010 --> 00:06:53,310
Do you want to go first?

218
00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:54,043
Who wants to go first?

219
00:06:54,043 --> 00:06:54,943
Where should we go first?

220
00:06:54,943 --> 00:06:57,310
I think we should check out the gloomy guys first.

221
00:06:57,310 --> 00:06:58,543
Okay.

222
00:06:58,543 --> 00:06:59,410
That'd be better.

223
00:06:59,410 --> 00:07:00,810
Why do you say we're gloomy?

224
00:07:00,810 --> 00:07:02,143
- Since you're guys. / - Men first.

225
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:04,110
What's interesting is that the two teams should have

226
00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:07,343
met for the first time here, in the studio.

227
00:07:07,343 --> 00:07:08,410
But I heard they'd already met.

228
00:07:08,410 --> 00:07:09,976
- Did you meet in the U.S.? / - We met already.

229
00:07:09,976 --> 00:07:11,043
You met already?

230
00:07:11,043 --> 00:07:12,643
We didn't meet in the U.S.

231
00:07:12,643 --> 00:07:16,476
We met on the day when we planned our trips.

232
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:18,110
Oh, then...

233
00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:19,743
Oh, my face. What do I do?

234
00:07:19,743 --> 00:07:21,810
- I just woke up and went. / - Seriously...

235
00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:22,843
Your face is in trouble?

236
00:07:22,843 --> 00:07:24,143
What do I do?

237
00:07:24,143 --> 00:07:25,410
- You have to watch this. / - Her face is in trouble.

238
00:07:25,410 --> 00:07:27,376
- Oh, no. / - We knew it was a shoot.

239
00:07:27,376 --> 00:07:29,710
So we had full makeup on.

240
00:07:29,710 --> 00:07:31,876
But these two came as if they were

241
00:07:31,876 --> 00:07:33,276
visiting the supermarket in front of their house.

242
00:07:33,276 --> 00:07:35,143
Please don't do a before-after comparison.

243
00:07:35,876 --> 00:07:37,910
This doesn't look like a battle.

244
00:07:37,910 --> 00:07:38,610
It's like a family trip.

245
00:07:38,610 --> 00:07:39,943
Are they on a date?

246
00:07:39,943 --> 00:07:42,276
I thought we were all going together.

247
00:07:42,276 --> 00:07:43,610
I thought Battle Trip

248
00:07:43,610 --> 00:07:45,310
was changing concepts.

249
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:47,543
I thought it'd be a Love Trip.

250
00:07:48,443 --> 00:07:50,110
Love Trip?

251
00:07:50,110 --> 00:07:51,610
You thought it was similar to "We Got Married."

252
00:07:51,610 --> 00:07:53,276
We got together and had the meeting so...

253
00:07:54,843 --> 00:07:55,710
For us...

254
00:07:55,710 --> 00:07:56,610
Give us one spoiler.

255
00:07:56,610 --> 00:07:58,076
Who likes to drink?

256
00:07:58,076 --> 00:07:59,110
- Me. / - Me.

257
00:07:59,110 --> 00:08:00,076
- Me. / - You all do, right?

258
00:08:00,743 --> 00:08:02,243
- We... / - Sikyung...

259
00:08:02,243 --> 00:08:03,776
Sikyung, you don't actually have to walk over there.

260
00:08:03,776 --> 00:08:05,176
Sikyung!

261
00:08:05,176 --> 00:08:06,976
He doesn't like to drink. He is alcohol.

262
00:08:06,976 --> 00:08:07,776
He's made of alcohol.

263
00:08:07,776 --> 00:08:09,076
- For today... / - Yura's here too.

264
00:08:09,076 --> 00:08:10,743
I think we've won in this respect.

265
00:08:10,743 --> 00:08:13,143
Because the highest of quality wines

266
00:08:13,143 --> 00:08:15,676
in the U.S. are made in...

267
00:08:15,676 --> 00:08:17,710
- Napa Valley. / - We went to Napa Valley.

268
00:08:17,710 --> 00:08:19,943
- There's a wine train there. / - Sikyung's still there.

269
00:08:19,943 --> 00:08:21,643
- He won't come back. / - We took the wine train.

270
00:08:21,643 --> 00:08:24,343
We had a course meal on it.

271
00:08:24,343 --> 00:08:26,410
Visiting the various wineries...

272
00:08:26,410 --> 00:08:28,876
- Wineries? / - We tasted the wine...

273
00:08:29,676 --> 00:08:32,543
We saw how the wine is made.

274
00:08:32,543 --> 00:08:34,343
Napa Valley wine can be

275
00:08:34,343 --> 00:08:36,110
bought in Korea for cheap.

276
00:08:37,343 --> 00:08:38,076
Who are you?

277
00:08:38,076 --> 00:08:39,310
- Let's just watch. / - You'll see it.

278
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:40,076
Okay then.

279
00:08:40,076 --> 00:08:41,910
Let's check out the gloomy tour.

280
00:08:41,910 --> 00:08:43,410
Let's check out the gloomy tour.

281
00:08:45,610 --> 00:08:47,410
Let's check out Northern California.

282
00:08:54,310 --> 00:08:55,343
You have to play this song.

283
00:08:55,343 --> 00:08:56,043
Are you there already?

284
00:08:56,043 --> 00:08:57,110
- Oh, here... / - This is it!

285
00:08:57,110 --> 00:08:58,943
You can see Girl's Day with no makeup.

286
00:08:58,943 --> 00:08:59,976
It wasn't completely without makeup.

287
00:09:06,210 --> 00:09:07,043
Who is that?

288
00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:10,810
Hello.

289
00:09:12,343 --> 00:09:13,843
No one is here yet.

290
00:09:18,210 --> 00:09:20,643
But with Minah...

291
00:09:20,643 --> 00:09:22,143
- Yura... / - You look better without makeup.

292
00:09:22,143 --> 00:09:23,243
Yeah.

293
00:09:23,243 --> 00:09:24,143
(He's a Girl's Day fan)

294
00:09:24,843 --> 00:09:25,710
She's so cute.

295
00:09:25,710 --> 00:09:28,110
Donggeun just gasped.

296
00:09:28,576 --> 00:09:29,143
Okay.

297
00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:31,643
Today...

298
00:09:31,643 --> 00:09:32,943
Will she...

299
00:09:32,943 --> 00:09:35,143
Will she actually be on time?

300
00:09:35,143 --> 00:09:36,743
I'll keep watch today.

301
00:09:37,976 --> 00:09:39,410
Current time.

302
00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:41,243
1:50.

303
00:09:41,243 --> 00:09:43,376
We agreed to meet at 2 and I'm 10 minutes early.

304
00:09:44,376 --> 00:09:47,043
Do you know your opponents?

305
00:09:47,043 --> 00:09:48,743
(Never met before)

306
00:09:48,743 --> 00:09:50,510
I hope it's Yura.

307
00:09:50,510 --> 00:09:51,876
First meetings are awkward.

308
00:09:53,976 --> 00:09:55,476
(Surprised)

309
00:09:56,876 --> 00:09:58,143
Hello.

310
00:09:58,143 --> 00:09:59,510
Hello.

311
00:09:59,510 --> 00:10:01,276
It's nice to meet you.

312
00:10:01,276 --> 00:10:02,443
He's all dressed up.

313
00:10:03,376 --> 00:10:04,476
He's all dressed up.

314
00:10:05,176 --> 00:10:06,376
Dressed up.

315
00:10:07,376 --> 00:10:09,443
How awkward.

316
00:10:09,443 --> 00:10:13,176
(It's the first time they're meeting)

317
00:10:13,176 --> 00:10:15,610
(Awkward)

318
00:10:17,076 --> 00:10:20,043
(Why does it feel like a date?)

319
00:10:20,043 --> 00:10:20,943
(What do I talk about?)

320
00:10:20,943 --> 00:10:22,610
(Think! Think! Think!)

321
00:10:22,610 --> 00:10:24,476
I'm your senior, right?

322
00:10:24,476 --> 00:10:25,810
- Senior, right? / - It's like a blind date.

323
00:10:26,843 --> 00:10:27,876
That's the first thing you said?

324
00:10:27,876 --> 00:10:28,776
Thought it was "We Got Married."

325
00:10:28,776 --> 00:10:29,843
That was a strange question, right?

326
00:10:29,843 --> 00:10:30,876
"I'm your senior, right?"

327
00:10:30,876 --> 00:10:32,843
That is a very strange first question.

328
00:10:32,843 --> 00:10:34,810
I've watched him ever since

329
00:10:34,810 --> 00:10:36,176
I was a little kid...

330
00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:40,243
Choi Jungwon has changed so much.

331
00:10:40,243 --> 00:10:41,243
Yes, of course.

332
00:10:41,876 --> 00:10:44,643
Can we drink this?

333
00:10:49,743 --> 00:10:51,276
Is Jihun not here yet?

334
00:10:52,743 --> 00:10:53,676
Why isn't he here yet?

335
00:10:53,676 --> 00:10:54,943
He's a better talker.

336
00:11:00,276 --> 00:11:01,710
Why are you doing this to us?

337
00:11:05,210 --> 00:11:07,343
Then how old are you now?

338
00:11:07,343 --> 00:11:08,043
Is this an arranged marriage?

339
00:11:08,043 --> 00:11:09,443
- Is that what you were doing? / - Geez.

340
00:11:09,443 --> 00:11:11,743
Come on, Jungwon!

341
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:13,710
- Jungwon's always serious. / - "I'm your senior."

342
00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:16,510
I'm turning 26 this year.

343
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:17,810
26.

344
00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:19,510
- Year of the Rooster. / - Yes.

345
00:11:21,276 --> 00:11:22,143
What zodiac are you?

346
00:11:23,276 --> 00:11:24,210
Rooster.

347
00:11:24,210 --> 00:11:25,610
- Really? / - Yes.

348
00:11:25,610 --> 00:11:27,176
That's why you calculated so fast.

349
00:11:27,176 --> 00:11:29,343
- Jihun's the same age. / - Same age.

350
00:11:29,343 --> 00:11:30,410
- Same age. / - Year of the Rooster.

351
00:11:31,210 --> 00:11:33,376
What is this? It doesn't feel like I'm on Battle Trip.

352
00:11:34,943 --> 00:11:36,776
Is Battle Trip some kind of a front...

353
00:11:36,776 --> 00:11:38,543
- It's sort of like... / - To pull a prank on us?

354
00:11:40,543 --> 00:11:41,943
When is Jihun going to be here?

355
00:11:42,710 --> 00:11:44,010
Why do you keep asking for me?

356
00:11:45,543 --> 00:11:46,510
That's funny.

357
00:11:47,276 --> 00:11:50,510
(The third trip designer arrives exactly on time at 2)

358
00:11:52,443 --> 00:11:53,810
Hi.

359
00:11:53,810 --> 00:11:56,176
- Hello. / - Hello.

360
00:11:56,743 --> 00:11:57,843
Hello.

361
00:11:58,643 --> 00:11:59,843
Hello.

362
00:12:01,710 --> 00:12:03,276
Oh, I see...

363
00:12:05,043 --> 00:12:07,510
- Oh, I see... / - She's cute.

364
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:09,676
Yura actually has swollen eyes.

365
00:12:11,576 --> 00:12:12,710
Sorry, I'm late.

366
00:12:12,710 --> 00:12:14,076
- Hello. / - I'm sorry.

367
00:12:14,076 --> 00:12:15,276
I just came too.

368
00:12:16,476 --> 00:12:18,110
She's really cool.

369
00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:20,343
She's really cool.

370
00:12:20,343 --> 00:12:21,876
What?

371
00:12:22,676 --> 00:12:24,843
She just got up and came here.

372
00:12:24,843 --> 00:12:27,810
She just got up and came here.

373
00:12:27,810 --> 00:12:29,643
(Jihun, what on earth is wrong with you?)

374
00:12:29,643 --> 00:12:31,843
- I couldn't dare ask. / - I got up an hour ago.

375
00:12:31,843 --> 00:12:33,610
I was shocked when you came in.

376
00:12:33,610 --> 00:12:34,210
Why?

377
00:12:34,210 --> 00:12:35,776
I thought you were a lion.

378
00:12:38,643 --> 00:12:40,410
I feel weird because we're so dressed up.

379
00:12:40,410 --> 00:12:41,876
We shouldn't have dressed up either.

380
00:12:41,876 --> 00:12:43,276
You've got full makeup on?

381
00:12:43,276 --> 00:12:44,776
You've got full makeup on?

382
00:12:47,310 --> 00:12:48,576
You've got full makeup on?

383
00:12:50,243 --> 00:12:51,610
He's put a lot of thought into it.

384
00:12:51,610 --> 00:12:52,676
I see.

385
00:12:53,376 --> 00:12:57,110
You have to choose where you'll go.

386
00:12:57,110 --> 00:13:00,176
I've been on Battle Trip as the special host.

387
00:13:00,176 --> 00:13:01,676
I was a special host once.

388
00:13:01,676 --> 00:13:02,810
In the end,

389
00:13:02,810 --> 00:13:06,043
the destination the judges want to go end up winning.

390
00:13:06,043 --> 00:13:07,110
Nice places.

391
00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:09,843
Then when we pick our destination...

392
00:13:09,843 --> 00:13:12,543
So the team that chooses the better place will win.

393
00:13:12,543 --> 00:13:13,943
So in a nutshell,

394
00:13:13,943 --> 00:13:16,810
Southern California is from L.A. to San Diego.

395
00:13:17,643 --> 00:13:19,010
Northern California is...

396
00:13:19,010 --> 00:13:21,576
San Jose to San Francisco.

397
00:13:21,576 --> 00:13:22,276
San Jose?

398
00:13:22,276 --> 00:13:23,210
There are two major cities.

399
00:13:23,210 --> 00:13:24,810
L.A. and San Francisco.

400
00:13:24,810 --> 00:13:26,210
I like San Francisco...

401
00:13:26,210 --> 00:13:27,210
- Because... / - Me too.

402
00:13:27,210 --> 00:13:28,510
Me too.

403
00:13:28,510 --> 00:13:29,643
What's going on?

404
00:13:29,643 --> 00:13:30,343
What about you, Minah?

405
00:13:31,143 --> 00:13:32,343
Then I choose L.A.

406
00:13:32,343 --> 00:13:33,743
Then let's divide 3 to 1.

407
00:13:33,743 --> 00:13:34,976
- San Francisco. / - You go alone.

408
00:13:34,976 --> 00:13:36,543
- The three of you go. / - Let's go, us three.

409
00:13:36,543 --> 00:13:38,310
- She can travel alone. / - 3 to 1.

410
00:13:38,310 --> 00:13:40,143
- Traveling alone isn't too bad. / - Right.

411
00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:41,843
You can make many good memories.

412
00:13:41,843 --> 00:13:43,943
Let's do a 3 on 1.

413
00:13:43,943 --> 00:13:45,376
It was actually decided

414
00:13:45,376 --> 00:13:47,243
when you entered.

415
00:13:47,243 --> 00:13:48,443
If you look under your seats...

416
00:13:48,443 --> 00:13:49,576
- What's going on? / - You'll see a panel.

417
00:13:50,310 --> 00:13:52,976
One seat has the king panel.

418
00:13:53,610 --> 00:13:54,510
On the floor?

419
00:13:54,510 --> 00:13:56,043
- Oh? / - Is this it?

420
00:13:57,576 --> 00:13:59,876
- So that's how they decided. / - That's how.

421
00:14:03,176 --> 00:14:04,243
Great idea.

422
00:14:05,576 --> 00:14:06,410
Is this it?

423
00:14:06,410 --> 00:14:07,376
Oh, everyone has one?

424
00:14:07,376 --> 00:14:09,410
What? I thought only I had it.

425
00:14:09,410 --> 00:14:10,476
What is this?

426
00:14:10,476 --> 00:14:12,243
1, 2, 3.

427
00:14:14,143 --> 00:14:14,976
What is this?

428
00:14:14,976 --> 00:14:16,143
1, 2, 3.

429
00:14:19,110 --> 00:14:19,876
What is this?

430
00:14:19,876 --> 00:14:20,943
- Who's the king? / - 1, 2, 3.

431
00:14:23,076 --> 00:14:24,176
What's going on?

432
00:14:25,376 --> 00:14:26,343
- You're the king. / - This is...

433
00:14:26,343 --> 00:14:28,010
So the oldest person is king.

434
00:14:28,010 --> 00:14:29,143
It's in order of age?

435
00:14:29,143 --> 00:14:30,010
Order of age.

436
00:14:30,010 --> 00:14:31,110
He and I are the same age.

437
00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:32,910
- Oh, really? / - Don't be like that.

438
00:14:32,910 --> 00:14:33,876
We're the same age.

439
00:14:34,810 --> 00:14:36,443
Then...

440
00:14:37,943 --> 00:14:39,510
Isn't L.A. better?

441
00:14:40,543 --> 00:14:42,343
- It's the "La La Land" shoot location. / - It's hard.

442
00:14:42,343 --> 00:14:43,910
It's the "La La Land" shoot location.

443
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:45,610
I don't really like "La La Land."

444
00:14:46,476 --> 00:14:47,376
I haven't seen it.

445
00:14:48,843 --> 00:14:49,810
Hasn't seen it...

446
00:14:49,810 --> 00:14:51,210
Thing is...

447
00:14:51,210 --> 00:14:52,576
Why are you looking at me like that?

448
00:14:52,576 --> 00:14:54,276
Do you want to go to L.A.?

449
00:14:54,276 --> 00:14:56,110
- I want to go to L.A. / - Really?

450
00:14:56,110 --> 00:14:56,943
Why?

451
00:14:56,943 --> 00:14:58,176
I like warm weather.

452
00:14:59,076 --> 00:15:00,476
Is San Francisco cold?

453
00:15:01,210 --> 00:15:03,743
- San Francisco is more autumn weather. / - I see.

454
00:15:03,743 --> 00:15:05,310
Last year,

455
00:15:05,310 --> 00:15:08,543
and it was the worst cold I've ever had...

456
00:15:09,210 --> 00:15:10,776
- So it's a bit... / - You had a cold?

457
00:15:13,743 --> 00:15:14,843
So it's a bit...

458
00:15:16,243 --> 00:15:17,610
Then for Yura...

459
00:15:19,310 --> 00:15:21,543
(Thanks, Jihun)

460
00:15:21,543 --> 00:15:23,810
Let's let her enjoy L.A. for real this time.

461
00:15:23,810 --> 00:15:25,610
- We'll send you to L.A. / - Okay.

462
00:15:25,610 --> 00:15:27,610
- We'll send you to L.A. / - Okay.

463
00:15:27,610 --> 00:15:29,910
Why does everyone hate L.A.?

464
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:31,510
L.A. is awesome.

465
00:15:31,510 --> 00:15:32,910
Because for us,

466
00:15:32,910 --> 00:15:35,043
we've been to L.A. a few times.

467
00:15:35,043 --> 00:15:37,076
But the northern area...

468
00:15:37,076 --> 00:15:38,910
There wasn't much of an opportunity to go there.

469
00:15:38,910 --> 00:15:40,743
- That's true. / - That being the case...

470
00:15:40,743 --> 00:15:42,510
We'd like to take this opportunity

471
00:15:42,510 --> 00:15:45,343
to really explore California.

472
00:15:46,443 --> 00:15:48,343
- Sorry about this. / - I want to go to San Francisco.

473
00:15:49,376 --> 00:15:50,076
Yura.

474
00:15:50,076 --> 00:15:51,410
- Have fun on your own. / - Yura.

475
00:15:51,410 --> 00:15:52,910
If we go to a warm city,

476
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:54,743
we can go to the beach and surf.

477
00:15:54,743 --> 00:15:56,210
I'm not interested in that.

478
00:15:56,210 --> 00:15:57,210
Yura.

479
00:15:57,210 --> 00:15:58,410
- Then what do you like to do? / - Mark my words.

480
00:15:58,410 --> 00:15:59,943
After the shot of her saying this,

481
00:15:59,943 --> 00:16:03,176
they'll play her having a blast on a surfboard.

482
00:16:03,176 --> 00:16:04,176
I guarantee it.

483
00:16:09,276 --> 00:16:13,876
(Sneak preview of next week's episode)

484
00:16:15,876 --> 00:16:17,743
I wanted to go to San Francisco...

485
00:16:20,510 --> 00:16:21,310
Take this.

486
00:16:22,010 --> 00:16:24,076
We can go to San Francisco.

487
00:16:24,076 --> 00:16:25,310
1, 2, 3. California!

488
00:16:25,310 --> 00:16:26,510
Let's go!

489
00:16:36,676 --> 00:16:38,510
(On the day of departure for Northern California)

490
00:16:38,510 --> 00:16:39,176
Aren't you cold?

491
00:16:39,176 --> 00:16:40,910
It's too cold in Korea.

492
00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:42,176
- Did you get some sleep? / - It's so cold...

493
00:16:42,176 --> 00:16:43,910
But you dressed for looks not warmth.

494
00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:44,610
No, I didn't.

495
00:16:44,610 --> 00:16:46,310
That's the natural look of myself.

496
00:16:46,310 --> 00:16:49,476
Jihun is always late.

497
00:16:49,476 --> 00:16:50,443
So...

498
00:16:50,443 --> 00:16:52,343
I have to always nag him to come early

499
00:16:52,343 --> 00:16:53,310
so that he actually arrives on time.

500
00:16:53,943 --> 00:16:55,076
Stop talking nonsense.

501
00:16:57,443 --> 00:16:59,410
Did you come up with our itinerary?

502
00:16:59,410 --> 00:17:02,676
I sort of have an itinerary.

503
00:17:02,676 --> 00:17:05,210
But we'll go with the feel.

504
00:17:05,210 --> 00:17:07,376
Use our gut feelings to make good decisions.

505
00:17:07,376 --> 00:17:08,676
- Cluck. / - Cluck.

506
00:17:08,676 --> 00:17:09,576
- Cluck. / - Cluck.

507
00:17:09,576 --> 00:17:10,343
Let's go.

508
00:17:13,743 --> 00:17:16,510
(They set out to San Francisco)

509
00:17:21,610 --> 00:17:23,810
- The flight isn't that long. / - Right.

510
00:17:23,810 --> 00:17:24,943
It only takes 10 hours and 20 minutes?

511
00:17:25,476 --> 00:17:27,176
Flights usually take 10 to 11 hours.

512
00:17:31,410 --> 00:17:32,610
Golden Gate Bridge...

513
00:17:33,376 --> 00:17:35,010
It's the bridge we always see in the movies.

514
00:17:35,010 --> 00:17:36,010
That reminds me of our trip.

515
00:17:36,010 --> 00:17:37,110
You must visit there.

516
00:17:37,110 --> 00:17:38,043
I love that place.

517
00:17:38,043 --> 00:17:39,443
That's the symbol of San Francisco.

518
00:17:39,443 --> 00:17:40,643
The beach stretches along the road.

519
00:17:40,643 --> 00:17:42,210
There's a city on a hill

520
00:17:42,210 --> 00:17:43,276
that stretches far behind it.

521
00:17:44,743 --> 00:17:47,010
San Francisco is the no. 1 city

522
00:17:47,010 --> 00:17:48,410
that Americans want to live in.

523
00:17:48,410 --> 00:17:49,776
Seals.

524
00:17:49,776 --> 00:17:51,076
You saw that many seals?

525
00:17:51,076 --> 00:17:52,876
I'm going to San Francisco this year.

526
00:17:55,776 --> 00:17:57,976
The most famous winery in California.

527
00:17:57,976 --> 00:17:59,676
The largest producer of wine.

528
00:18:00,576 --> 00:18:01,976
We take a train...

529
00:18:02,476 --> 00:18:03,343
Wine train!

530
00:18:04,343 --> 00:18:06,043
- That's... / - Winery!

531
00:18:06,043 --> 00:18:07,076
- See that? / - That place, everyone...

532
00:18:07,076 --> 00:18:09,010
- I said I wanted San Francisco! / - Waterfall.

533
00:18:09,010 --> 00:18:11,010
Yosemite!

534
00:18:11,010 --> 00:18:12,076
Is that Yosemite?

535
00:18:12,776 --> 00:18:14,643
- We saw rainbows there too. / - Amazing.

536
00:18:18,376 --> 00:18:19,310
- Right now... / - Wine...

537
00:18:19,310 --> 00:18:20,943
- How can L.A. win? / - We've won.

538
00:18:20,943 --> 00:18:23,076
- How can L.A. win? / - Isn't it game over already?

539
00:18:23,076 --> 00:18:25,076
I've never seen any of this on Battle Trip before.

540
00:18:25,076 --> 00:18:26,443
That's North California.

541
00:18:26,443 --> 00:18:27,710
- Where's that? / - The night sky of Yosemite.

542
00:18:28,743 --> 00:18:30,910
Do we have to win with Korean food or what?

543
00:18:33,843 --> 00:18:37,410
(Day 1 in San Francisco, Northern California)

544
00:18:49,010 --> 00:18:50,243
Now that we're in California,

545
00:18:50,243 --> 00:18:51,810
we must wear our sunglasses.

546
00:18:51,810 --> 00:18:53,943
- The weather is amazing here. / - The weather...

547
00:18:53,943 --> 00:18:56,010
Hey, this is Alamo Square

548
00:18:56,010 --> 00:18:58,676
which is located in the heart of the city.

549
00:18:58,676 --> 00:18:59,810
- Alamo Square? / - Yes.

550
00:19:02,210 --> 00:19:03,076
What do we have here?

551
00:19:03,076 --> 00:19:05,343
First off, this area is...

552
00:19:05,343 --> 00:19:06,476
What's this architecture style?

553
00:19:06,476 --> 00:19:07,476
You mean this?

554
00:19:09,410 --> 00:19:11,476
- Is this called Victorian style? / - Victoria from f(x).

555
00:19:11,476 --> 00:19:12,943
Victoria from f(x).

556
00:19:12,943 --> 00:19:14,610
It's on TV a lot.

557
00:19:16,176 --> 00:19:18,110
You mean those buildings, right?

558
00:19:18,110 --> 00:19:19,376
Seven houses.

559
00:19:19,376 --> 00:19:21,310
But people actually live in them.

560
00:19:21,310 --> 00:19:23,810
- They're all individual houses. / - It's residential.

561
00:19:23,810 --> 00:19:25,710
We came here...

562
00:19:26,776 --> 00:19:28,643
With the intention of taking a great trip.

563
00:19:28,643 --> 00:19:30,476
- We go up here... / - Can you film it from that side?

564
00:19:30,476 --> 00:19:31,843
It's blocking my entire face.

565
00:19:32,443 --> 00:19:34,410
Jihun is really picky.

566
00:19:34,410 --> 00:19:34,843
Be more considerate.

567
00:19:34,843 --> 00:19:37,010
- You should hold it like this. / - I didn't know that.

568
00:19:38,043 --> 00:19:40,643
- Can't you see he's filming me? / - Okay, okay.

569
00:19:43,876 --> 00:19:45,510
The view from here is excellent.

570
00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:49,076
That's the city of San Francisco, right?

571
00:19:49,076 --> 00:19:49,476
Downtown.

572
00:19:49,476 --> 00:19:51,510
All the high-rise buildings are there.

573
00:19:51,510 --> 00:19:53,410
The ocean must be beyond that.

574
00:19:55,410 --> 00:19:57,310
The view is indeed spectacular from here.

575
00:19:57,310 --> 00:19:58,876
This park feels like

576
00:19:58,876 --> 00:20:01,110
a park in your neighborhood.

577
00:20:01,110 --> 00:20:02,410
A park in your neighborhood.

578
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:03,576
- Be quiet. / - That's right.

579
00:20:03,576 --> 00:20:04,343
He's right.

580
00:20:04,343 --> 00:20:07,476
- That's how a regular park looks. / - Regular park.

581
00:20:07,476 --> 00:20:08,276
So what are we doing today?

582
00:20:08,276 --> 00:20:10,710
First...

583
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:13,043
We will rent a convertible today.

584
00:20:14,176 --> 00:20:15,043
A convertible.

585
00:20:15,043 --> 00:20:16,210
Since it's warm weather.

586
00:20:16,210 --> 00:20:17,576
You need to drive a convertible in the U.S.

587
00:20:17,576 --> 00:20:19,676
If you drive a convertible there, you'll freeze to death.

588
00:20:19,676 --> 00:20:21,710
It's really warm in the afternoon.

589
00:20:21,710 --> 00:20:23,376
A convertible...

590
00:20:23,376 --> 00:20:24,576
- Really? / - I booked one.

591
00:20:24,576 --> 00:20:26,776
- A convertible? / - The weather is great here.

592
00:20:26,776 --> 00:20:29,176
- We need to drive a convertible. / - You're right.

593
00:20:29,176 --> 00:20:30,610
But it must be expensive.

594
00:20:30,610 --> 00:20:32,543
I booked us a luxurious one.

595
00:20:32,543 --> 00:20:34,376
- Let's get going. / - Really?

596
00:20:34,376 --> 00:20:35,543
I can drive.

597
00:20:35,543 --> 00:20:36,943
I got the international driver's license from Korea.

598
00:20:36,943 --> 00:20:39,576
Let's take a look around this area on our convertible.

599
00:20:39,576 --> 00:20:40,943
We are like those

600
00:20:40,943 --> 00:20:42,610
rich international students,

601
00:20:42,610 --> 00:20:43,810
living in this posh area.

602
00:20:46,376 --> 00:20:50,443
(They take the cable car downtown)

603
00:20:52,410 --> 00:20:53,976
The cable car is like

604
00:20:53,976 --> 00:20:55,576
the town shuttle bus in Korea.

605
00:20:56,810 --> 00:20:57,710
Bus...

606
00:21:01,210 --> 00:21:02,310
This is...

607
00:21:03,210 --> 00:21:05,743
The famous cable car of San Francisco.

608
00:21:09,710 --> 00:21:11,510
This is so cool though.

609
00:21:11,510 --> 00:21:13,776
When you travel down the hill on the cable car,

610
00:21:13,776 --> 00:21:15,576
you can see the beach.

611
00:21:15,576 --> 00:21:16,510
That's beautiful.

612
00:21:16,510 --> 00:21:17,943
I was finally on the cable car.

613
00:21:18,876 --> 00:21:20,276
(Cluck Cluck Tour in North California)

614
00:21:20,276 --> 00:21:23,843
(Drive around Lombard Street in a convertible)

615
00:21:23,843 --> 00:21:27,510
Let's look around Lombard Street.

616
00:21:27,510 --> 00:21:30,610
This is the street that was in "Inside Out."

617
00:21:30,610 --> 00:21:31,476
It was in that animation film.

618
00:21:31,476 --> 00:21:32,543
No wonder!

619
00:21:32,543 --> 00:21:34,043
- You've seen it a lot, right? / - Yes.

620
00:21:34,043 --> 00:21:35,110
No wonder!

621
00:21:35,110 --> 00:21:36,776
So this is that place.

622
00:21:38,410 --> 00:21:39,776
Hey.

623
00:21:39,776 --> 00:21:41,376
You said you booked a convertible.

624
00:21:42,743 --> 00:21:43,943
- Oh, an old car. / - What's that?

625
00:21:45,610 --> 00:21:47,310
How much did that cost to rent?

626
00:21:47,310 --> 00:21:48,176
It's pretty expensive.

627
00:21:48,176 --> 00:21:51,176
3, 2, 1.

628
00:21:51,176 --> 00:21:52,643
Ta-da.

629
00:21:52,643 --> 00:21:55,576
3, 2, 1.

630
00:21:55,576 --> 00:21:57,276
Ta-da.

631
00:21:59,443 --> 00:22:01,676
(The Cluck Cluck Tour convertible!)

632
00:22:02,310 --> 00:22:03,010
That's cute.

633
00:22:03,010 --> 00:22:04,343
What is this?

634
00:22:04,343 --> 00:22:06,143
Does it use the smell of flowers for gas?

635
00:22:06,143 --> 00:22:07,210
That's so cute.

636
00:22:08,843 --> 00:22:10,743
I didn't know Jungwon was into that.

637
00:22:10,743 --> 00:22:12,143
- It can travel 120km/hr. / - For real?

638
00:22:12,143 --> 00:22:13,443
- You must try it. / - 120?

639
00:22:15,576 --> 00:22:17,643
This is the trend these days.

640
00:22:17,643 --> 00:22:18,976
So cute.

641
00:22:19,743 --> 00:22:21,110
That's so cute!

642
00:22:21,110 --> 00:22:22,076
I want to buy one.

643
00:22:22,076 --> 00:22:24,043
- But it is cute indeed. / - That's really cute.

644
00:22:24,043 --> 00:22:25,576
You wave to people in that

645
00:22:25,576 --> 00:22:27,076
and they all wave back.

646
00:22:27,076 --> 00:22:28,210
You just become friends.

647
00:22:30,410 --> 00:22:34,376
(You get safety training and gear)

648
00:22:36,843 --> 00:22:38,010
It's so hard to get into this thing.

649
00:22:38,576 --> 00:22:40,576
I think we were supposed to ride this with women.

650
00:22:40,576 --> 00:22:41,776
My goodness.

651
00:22:41,776 --> 00:22:42,576
Hey, this is...

652
00:22:42,576 --> 00:22:43,576
Why's it so tight?

653
00:22:43,576 --> 00:22:45,410
Is this the convertible?

654
00:22:46,276 --> 00:22:48,476
Can you move your shoulders? It's too tight.

655
00:22:50,076 --> 00:22:51,743
(He feels guilty)

656
00:22:51,976 --> 00:22:52,676
Let's go.

657
00:22:56,910 --> 00:22:58,010
What is this?

658
00:23:01,110 --> 00:23:03,643
Shouldn't we have rented a convertible like that one?

659
00:23:03,643 --> 00:23:04,710
Isn't that a convertible?

660
00:23:04,710 --> 00:23:07,310
Shouldn't we be in one of those right now?

661
00:23:08,676 --> 00:23:10,110
Why do we look pathetic?

662
00:23:10,110 --> 00:23:11,243
We do look pathetic.

663
00:23:12,210 --> 00:23:13,410
- We look poor. / - It's still a convertible.

664
00:23:13,410 --> 00:23:15,976
It's like we're riding a cart in the amusement park.

665
00:23:17,576 --> 00:23:19,010
Look at the fire truck.

666
00:23:19,010 --> 00:23:20,143
Look at the fire truck.

667
00:23:20,143 --> 00:23:21,810
It's like the one in a museum.

668
00:23:21,810 --> 00:23:22,710
It's so cool.

669
00:23:24,076 --> 00:23:25,343
The fire truck looks so nice.

670
00:23:27,276 --> 00:23:28,443
Keep driving straight,

671
00:23:28,443 --> 00:23:30,210
and we're going to take a left.

672
00:23:31,076 --> 00:23:32,876
Here. Take a left.

673
00:23:33,976 --> 00:23:35,710
(Okay then)

674
00:23:37,176 --> 00:23:39,410
It's the perfect weather to be on a convertible.

675
00:23:46,976 --> 00:23:48,210
You can drift.

676
00:23:48,210 --> 00:23:48,943
Really?

677
00:23:48,943 --> 00:23:49,976
It was fun.

678
00:23:51,176 --> 00:23:53,510
(He drives furiously)

679
00:23:54,843 --> 00:23:58,076
(Let's go to Lombard Street)

680
00:23:59,543 --> 00:24:01,743
(Jihun, could you slow down?)

681
00:24:02,376 --> 00:24:03,976
The fastest speed!

682
00:24:04,776 --> 00:24:06,910
200km/hr!

683
00:24:08,910 --> 00:24:10,310
(Hey, it's dangerous)

684
00:24:11,643 --> 00:24:13,276
Hey, hey. Hey!

685
00:24:13,276 --> 00:24:15,810
- Why are you so scared? / - Hey, slow down.

686
00:24:15,810 --> 00:24:16,676
Right now...

687
00:24:16,676 --> 00:24:19,276
- Hey! Hey! / - I'm driving safely.

688
00:24:20,276 --> 00:24:23,143
(Something feels wrong)

689
00:24:23,143 --> 00:24:24,576
I dropped my phone.

690
00:24:25,476 --> 00:24:26,876
- What? / - Are you serious?

691
00:24:26,876 --> 00:24:28,576
(No way!)

692
00:24:28,576 --> 00:24:30,776
200km/hr!

693
00:24:34,076 --> 00:24:35,576
Good-bye.

694
00:24:35,576 --> 00:24:36,910
- What happened after that? / - We won.

695
00:24:36,910 --> 00:24:38,276
Can you pull over?

696
00:24:38,276 --> 00:24:39,210
Hold on. A car is coming.

697
00:24:43,776 --> 00:24:45,210
You idiot.

698
00:24:47,443 --> 00:24:49,676
I guess he found it. I think he picked it up.

699
00:24:51,743 --> 00:24:53,343
Such a peaceful place.

700
00:24:54,010 --> 00:24:56,176
You look very laid-back.

701
00:24:56,176 --> 00:24:59,010
You should've rented a real convertible, dummy.

702
00:25:00,276 --> 00:25:02,943
(Is your phone okay?)

703
00:25:03,776 --> 00:25:04,810
My gosh. Seriously.

704
00:25:04,810 --> 00:25:06,943
I think I would've cried.

705
00:25:06,943 --> 00:25:10,643
- That's my worst nightmare. / - But those roads...

706
00:25:11,143 --> 00:25:11,943
The cars don't travel fast.

707
00:25:11,943 --> 00:25:13,910
It's because you drove too fast!

708
00:25:13,910 --> 00:25:16,610
You should've got one with doors.

709
00:25:16,610 --> 00:25:17,376
Let's go.

710
00:25:19,676 --> 00:25:20,743
Hey, hey.

711
00:25:20,743 --> 00:25:21,610
A car's coming.

712
00:25:21,610 --> 00:25:22,510
Oh, there's a car.

713
00:25:22,510 --> 00:25:23,910
Get out and push!

714
00:25:23,910 --> 00:25:25,010
Geez!

715
00:25:27,476 --> 00:25:28,743
The one bad thing about those...

716
00:25:28,743 --> 00:25:30,876
- They can't reverse / - They can't reverse?

717
00:25:32,110 --> 00:25:33,076
What?

718
00:25:33,076 --> 00:25:34,876
Next time, get one that can reverse.

719
00:25:36,810 --> 00:25:37,610
Sorry.

720
00:25:38,243 --> 00:25:39,310
Is this it?

721
00:25:39,310 --> 00:25:41,276
You have to drive well from here.

722
00:25:41,276 --> 00:25:42,743
This is a great spot to take pictures.

723
00:25:45,510 --> 00:25:47,476
This is it.

724
00:25:47,476 --> 00:25:48,410
This is from "Inside Out."

725
00:25:49,776 --> 00:25:51,610
It's so pretty.

726
00:25:54,243 --> 00:25:56,210
They made it so it's less steep.

727
00:26:04,576 --> 00:26:05,610
Amazing.

728
00:26:09,943 --> 00:26:11,776
This is like a roller coaster.

729
00:26:13,810 --> 00:26:14,743
You need to get ready

730
00:26:14,743 --> 00:26:16,443
to go down this street.

731
00:26:26,343 --> 00:26:28,143
There are stairs for people

732
00:26:28,143 --> 00:26:29,543
on the side.

733
00:26:35,643 --> 00:26:36,376
Hey, slow down.

734
00:26:36,376 --> 00:26:37,276
Slow down!

735
00:26:39,343 --> 00:26:41,043
That's so pretty.

736
00:26:42,010 --> 00:26:42,976
Hey, hey, hey.

737
00:26:42,976 --> 00:26:43,810
Hey, hey.

738
00:26:43,810 --> 00:26:44,876
Don't worry, we're safe.

739
00:26:46,143 --> 00:26:47,043
Hey, hey.

740
00:26:49,810 --> 00:26:50,276
We're finished.

741
00:26:50,276 --> 00:26:51,610
- Hello. / - That was fast.

742
00:26:53,010 --> 00:26:55,343
The cars are driving very slowly.

743
00:26:55,343 --> 00:26:56,910
That's how we came down.

744
00:26:56,910 --> 00:26:58,810
You drove three times faster than that.

745
00:26:58,810 --> 00:26:59,710
- Really? / - Yes.

746
00:27:00,610 --> 00:27:01,776
- Did I? / - Yes.

747
00:27:01,776 --> 00:27:03,543
This car performs really well.

748
00:27:04,310 --> 00:27:05,210
Great cornering.

749
00:27:06,143 --> 00:27:07,010
You're hungry, aren't you?

750
00:27:07,943 --> 00:27:09,143
- I'm super hungry. / - Me too.

751
00:27:09,143 --> 00:27:11,343
Let's go take pictures with sea lions

752
00:27:11,343 --> 00:27:12,510
then eat some good food.

753
00:27:12,510 --> 00:27:13,843
- Fisherman's Wharf. / - Okay.

754
00:27:13,843 --> 00:27:15,810
Let's transport like this.

755
00:27:15,810 --> 00:27:16,376
How?

756
00:27:16,376 --> 00:27:17,143
Please don't.

757
00:27:17,143 --> 00:27:18,810
- No, no. / - No way.

758
00:27:18,810 --> 00:27:19,676
Jihun, don't do it

759
00:27:19,676 --> 00:27:20,576
Goodness.

760
00:27:20,576 --> 00:27:21,810
Like in the old days.

761
00:27:21,810 --> 00:27:24,110
Let's transport to Fisherman's Wharf.

762
00:27:24,110 --> 00:27:24,943
Like this.

763
00:27:24,943 --> 00:27:26,310
Must we do this?

764
00:27:26,310 --> 00:27:29,010
Many have failed trying to do this.

765
00:27:29,010 --> 00:27:30,576
Let's transport to Fisherman's Wharf!

766
00:27:31,710 --> 00:27:34,276
Why did they do such a poor job in editing?

767
00:27:34,976 --> 00:27:36,476
- Why didn't they use CG? / - "We're sorry."

768
00:27:36,476 --> 00:27:37,676
"We're sorry."

769
00:27:37,676 --> 00:27:38,876
That's clever.

770
00:27:38,876 --> 00:27:40,010
They apologized in advance.

771
00:27:42,943 --> 00:27:44,310
- Did you have fun? / - Yes.

772
00:27:44,310 --> 00:27:45,476
It was cold.

773
00:27:45,476 --> 00:27:46,576
I was cold because it was an open car.

774
00:27:46,576 --> 00:27:48,576
I think my nose is running too much.

775
00:27:48,576 --> 00:27:49,543
Seriously.

776
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:51,243
It's over there.

777
00:27:51,243 --> 00:27:52,810
Fisherman's Wharf.

778
00:27:52,810 --> 00:27:53,776
We're here.

779
00:27:55,343 --> 00:27:58,110
That sign with a crab is huge.

780
00:27:58,110 --> 00:27:59,410
It's here.

781
00:27:59,410 --> 00:28:00,943
It's like a market street.

782
00:28:02,410 --> 00:28:03,510
That looks good.

783
00:28:04,510 --> 00:28:05,176
Do you want to try it?

784
00:28:05,176 --> 00:28:06,610
What's this?

785
00:28:06,610 --> 00:28:07,843
Gosh, that looks good.

786
00:28:08,443 --> 00:28:10,376
- That looks amazing. / - How many claws is that?

787
00:28:12,310 --> 00:28:14,043
- I want the one with crab meat. / - Crab meat?

788
00:28:14,043 --> 00:28:16,676
- What's this one? / - I think it's a lobster roll.

789
00:28:16,676 --> 00:28:18,076
I think this one is a lobster roll

790
00:28:18,076 --> 00:28:19,376
and this one's crab...

791
00:28:19,376 --> 00:28:21,343
With lobster.

792
00:28:21,343 --> 00:28:23,310
Just one please. Here, here.

793
00:28:24,210 --> 00:28:26,010
It's packed with lobster?

794
00:28:26,010 --> 00:28:27,176
Yes, all lobster.

795
00:28:27,176 --> 00:28:28,176
Lobster claw.

796
00:28:28,176 --> 00:28:30,176
Koreans won't be able to finish an entire one.

797
00:28:30,176 --> 00:28:31,776
There's too much.

798
00:28:31,776 --> 00:28:32,810
It's not imitation crab meat?

799
00:28:32,810 --> 00:28:34,176
- It's real lobster? / - Real lobster.

800
00:28:34,176 --> 00:28:35,143
The entire thing.

801
00:28:35,143 --> 00:28:35,976
There's so much.

802
00:28:40,443 --> 00:28:42,710
(While Jungwon is paying)

803
00:28:42,710 --> 00:28:44,210
(A bite)

804
00:28:46,743 --> 00:28:48,510
Are you cutting it? What are you doing?

805
00:28:48,510 --> 00:28:51,043
Why are you eating it alone?

806
00:28:51,043 --> 00:28:52,876
You should wait for me.

807
00:28:52,876 --> 00:28:55,010
You two don't get along well.

808
00:28:55,010 --> 00:28:56,110
I only ate a little.

809
00:28:57,010 --> 00:28:59,643
There's a lot of crab meat.

810
00:29:01,276 --> 00:29:02,276
There's a lot of crab meat.

811
00:29:03,543 --> 00:29:05,276
American food is usually quite salty.

812
00:29:06,510 --> 00:29:08,310
But it's not salty.

813
00:29:09,510 --> 00:29:10,976
There's so much meat.

814
00:29:14,043 --> 00:29:15,710
Lobster and

815
00:29:15,710 --> 00:29:17,243
crab meat together

816
00:29:17,243 --> 00:29:19,410
taste really delicious.

817
00:29:23,376 --> 00:29:25,010
The buns are just regular buns, right?

818
00:29:25,010 --> 00:29:26,176
It's like a baguette.

819
00:29:26,176 --> 00:29:27,610
- American bun. / - Was it good?

820
00:29:27,610 --> 00:29:29,943
The buns tasted like ordinary buns.

821
00:29:29,943 --> 00:29:31,510
Let's try the crab cake.

822
00:29:32,376 --> 00:29:33,276
This?

823
00:29:35,443 --> 00:29:36,243
Just one please.

824
00:29:38,310 --> 00:29:39,510
That's a crab cake.

825
00:29:39,510 --> 00:29:41,776
- What's that? / - It's fried crab meat.

826
00:29:41,776 --> 00:29:42,910
- Like a croquette? / - Croquette.

827
00:29:42,910 --> 00:29:43,676
Yes, it's fried like a croquette.

828
00:29:43,676 --> 00:29:45,476
It's easily found in America

829
00:29:45,476 --> 00:29:47,643
but they don't really sell it here.

830
00:29:47,643 --> 00:29:49,210
This?

831
00:29:49,210 --> 00:29:50,376
It's a croquette.

832
00:29:54,543 --> 00:29:55,843
It could be hot.

833
00:29:59,143 --> 00:29:59,876
How is it?

834
00:30:01,376 --> 00:30:01,943
How is it?

835
00:30:01,943 --> 00:30:02,943
It's cold.

836
00:30:02,943 --> 00:30:03,710
It's cold.

837
00:30:05,676 --> 00:30:06,610
It looks hot.

838
00:30:12,676 --> 00:30:13,476
It's good.

839
00:30:14,343 --> 00:30:16,443
It's like a cold cake.

840
00:30:16,443 --> 00:30:18,510
- Exactly. / - It's a croquette.

841
00:30:18,510 --> 00:30:19,743
It's a crab meat croquette.

842
00:30:19,743 --> 00:30:20,510
That's right.

843
00:30:26,210 --> 00:30:27,076
Was it delicious?

844
00:30:27,076 --> 00:30:28,776
- It was really delicious. / - It was really good.

845
00:30:28,776 --> 00:30:30,310
Donggeun, have you tried it?

846
00:30:30,310 --> 00:30:32,543
I've never even seen it.

847
00:30:32,543 --> 00:30:34,876
I like...

848
00:30:35,676 --> 00:30:36,910
The crab roll better.

849
00:30:36,910 --> 00:30:37,843
Really? I think this is better.

850
00:30:37,843 --> 00:30:38,776
You think so?

851
00:30:39,676 --> 00:30:40,910
Should we go over there?

852
00:30:41,610 --> 00:30:43,676
Okay. There are more people now.

853
00:30:45,910 --> 00:30:47,510
(Pier 39)

854
00:30:47,510 --> 00:30:50,143
(A large shopping center with restaurants and gift shops)

855
00:30:50,143 --> 00:30:52,476
(Built on a pier in San Francisco, California)

856
00:30:53,010 --> 00:30:55,843
(There's a sea lion habitat nearby)

857
00:30:55,843 --> 00:30:58,676
(With street and band performances)

858
00:30:59,476 --> 00:31:00,543
- There are so many of them. / - This is it.

859
00:31:00,543 --> 00:31:03,110
This is the crab sculpture

860
00:31:03,110 --> 00:31:04,010
I told you about.

861
00:31:04,843 --> 00:31:07,543
- It's symbolic. / - We should take a picture.

862
00:31:08,210 --> 00:31:10,576
I can make you look much taller.

863
00:31:11,776 --> 00:31:13,776
Look. This is amazing.

864
00:31:13,776 --> 00:31:14,743
Look at this.

865
00:31:14,743 --> 00:31:15,676
This is so...

866
00:31:15,676 --> 00:31:17,276
- What is this? / - Look.

867
00:31:17,276 --> 00:31:18,110
Check out the next one.

868
00:31:18,110 --> 00:31:19,310
Hey.

869
00:31:19,310 --> 00:31:20,776
- Goodness. / - It's a good shot.

870
00:31:20,776 --> 00:31:21,976
I took a great picture.

871
00:31:21,976 --> 00:31:23,710
These old guys...

872
00:31:23,710 --> 00:31:26,310
Pictures are really important when you go traveling.

873
00:31:26,843 --> 00:31:29,476
Look at the composition. Get the right feel.

874
00:31:29,476 --> 00:31:32,443
I took it like this so you'd look taller.

875
00:31:32,443 --> 00:31:34,310
Let's see how good you are at taking pictures.

876
00:31:34,310 --> 00:31:35,076
Kim Jihun.

877
00:31:35,076 --> 00:31:36,043
When it comes to photos...

878
00:31:36,043 --> 00:31:37,243
- It's all about... / - Geez.

879
00:31:37,243 --> 00:31:38,710
How much care you put into it.

880
00:31:38,710 --> 00:31:39,410
Just take it.

881
00:31:39,410 --> 00:31:41,843
Pictures turn out better if you put more affection.

882
00:31:41,843 --> 00:31:43,410
He's right. You need affection.

883
00:31:43,410 --> 00:31:44,843
He should lie down on the floor.

884
00:31:44,843 --> 00:31:46,943
If the subject looks good,

885
00:31:46,943 --> 00:31:47,810
then the photo turns out good.

886
00:31:49,610 --> 00:31:51,410
Can't you put that bag away?

887
00:31:51,410 --> 00:31:53,076
It's a souvenir. Just take it.

888
00:31:56,143 --> 00:31:57,276
- That looks good. / - Nice use of negative space.

889
00:31:57,276 --> 00:31:57,843
That looks better.

890
00:31:57,843 --> 00:31:59,876
- He cut out the bag. / - Which one is better?

891
00:32:02,710 --> 00:32:04,110
Jihun looks like

892
00:32:04,110 --> 00:32:05,643
he's wearing a crab backpack.

893
00:32:06,843 --> 00:32:07,710
It looks like a heart.

894
00:32:13,543 --> 00:32:14,343
Which one is better?

895
00:32:14,343 --> 00:32:15,010
Yours is better.

896
00:32:15,010 --> 00:32:15,943
- See? / - Let's go.

897
00:32:15,943 --> 00:32:16,910
Photos are all about

898
00:32:16,910 --> 00:32:20,043
how much love you put into it.

899
00:32:20,043 --> 00:32:22,510
- That makes good photos. / - So you love me more.

900
00:32:23,543 --> 00:32:24,876
You hear that, don't you?

901
00:32:24,876 --> 00:32:26,110
You hear what you heard earlier, right?

902
00:32:27,576 --> 00:32:29,076
- Is it the same sound? / - Yes.

903
00:32:29,076 --> 00:32:30,610
They're not seagulls?

904
00:32:30,610 --> 00:32:32,110
No.

905
00:32:32,110 --> 00:32:32,910
I can hear them.

906
00:32:33,643 --> 00:32:34,610
It's their sound.

907
00:32:34,610 --> 00:32:35,810
- I hear it. / - I see them!

908
00:32:38,143 --> 00:32:38,943
There were so many.

909
00:32:38,943 --> 00:32:41,610
Seriously, there were about 2,000 of them.

910
00:32:41,610 --> 00:32:42,476
There are so many.

911
00:32:42,476 --> 00:32:43,810
They're really loud.

912
00:32:44,776 --> 00:32:46,610
- They keep grunting. / - Thing is...

913
00:32:46,610 --> 00:32:47,876
- That... / - They grunt.

914
00:32:47,876 --> 00:32:49,843
Back in the day, people who lived here

915
00:32:49,843 --> 00:32:51,043
didn't like the noise.

916
00:32:51,043 --> 00:32:53,176
They started liking it because

917
00:32:53,176 --> 00:32:54,476
it attracted tourists.

918
00:32:54,476 --> 00:32:56,176
- They're so cute. / - So cute.

919
00:32:57,776 --> 00:32:59,776
I don't know why they're there.

920
00:32:59,776 --> 00:33:02,410
- But they are resting there. / - They're fighting.

921
00:33:02,410 --> 00:33:04,110
It's trying to block the other one from coming up.

922
00:33:06,376 --> 00:33:07,443
- That one? / - Yes.

923
00:33:10,310 --> 00:33:12,876
Look at that. It's not letting it come up.

924
00:33:12,876 --> 00:33:14,343
- Those two... / - Yeah.

925
00:33:14,343 --> 00:33:15,410
It's a lovers' quarrel.

926
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:17,610
It's blocking him. They're fighting.

927
00:33:19,710 --> 00:33:21,876
(Roar)

928
00:33:22,376 --> 00:33:23,610
It won't die, will it?

929
00:33:25,443 --> 00:33:27,243
(I'm leaving)

930
00:33:29,143 --> 00:33:29,843
Let's go.

931
00:33:32,776 --> 00:33:33,576
Do you see the crab?

932
00:33:34,410 --> 00:33:35,676
(Pier 39's seafood set)

933
00:33:35,676 --> 00:33:36,576
That looks good.

934
00:33:36,576 --> 00:33:37,976
Check out the crab.

935
00:33:37,976 --> 00:33:39,376
What should we get?

936
00:33:39,376 --> 00:33:41,110
The recommendation is...

937
00:33:41,876 --> 00:33:43,843
Steamed whole crab.

938
00:33:45,743 --> 00:33:46,910
And...

939
00:33:46,910 --> 00:33:49,576
- It's not clam chowder. / - That looks good.

940
00:33:49,576 --> 00:33:51,410
It's crab chowder.

941
00:33:51,410 --> 00:33:54,176
- Crab chowder? / - It's made with crab...

942
00:33:54,176 --> 00:33:56,743
- Instead of clam. / - Mussels and shrimps.

943
00:33:56,743 --> 00:33:59,310
You can have as much seafood as you like.

944
00:33:59,310 --> 00:34:00,276
There are crabs everywhere.

945
00:34:01,443 --> 00:34:02,276
Look.

946
00:34:02,276 --> 00:34:03,810
Crabs are everywhere.

947
00:34:03,810 --> 00:34:05,510
Seriously, crabs are everywhere.

948
00:34:06,976 --> 00:34:07,876
(Hey)

949
00:34:07,876 --> 00:34:08,743
(Wow)

950
00:34:09,543 --> 00:34:11,543
They serve it as soon as we ordered.

951
00:34:11,543 --> 00:34:14,310
It'd be wonderful around sunset.

952
00:34:14,310 --> 00:34:15,476
- Yes. / - That's right.

953
00:34:15,476 --> 00:34:16,476
It has a great atmosphere.

954
00:34:18,810 --> 00:34:19,810
He's pouring white wine.

955
00:34:24,410 --> 00:34:26,176
(Jihun, look at that)

956
00:34:26,876 --> 00:34:28,143
This is like a work of art.

957
00:34:28,143 --> 00:34:28,743
Right?

958
00:34:28,743 --> 00:34:30,776
The crab even looks handsome.

959
00:34:30,776 --> 00:34:32,376
This is a must-have dish.

960
00:34:33,610 --> 00:34:36,543
This is for you.

961
00:34:36,543 --> 00:34:37,743
Is this crab chowder?

962
00:34:37,743 --> 00:34:38,810
Yes.

963
00:34:40,576 --> 00:34:41,710
That's cute.

964
00:34:41,710 --> 00:34:43,276
- Is it your concept to be cute? / - Is that provided?

965
00:34:43,276 --> 00:34:45,476
- Yes, they gave it to us. / - Is it from the restaurant?

966
00:34:45,476 --> 00:34:46,810
That's so cute though.

967
00:34:48,076 --> 00:34:50,143
Eat it with crab meat.

968
00:34:50,143 --> 00:34:53,343
- There's so much crab meat. / - Cheers.

969
00:34:54,843 --> 00:34:57,510
(What does the special crab chowder taste like?)

970
00:35:03,410 --> 00:35:04,443
Why the face?

971
00:35:05,043 --> 00:35:06,510
- What's wrong? / - Did it taste unfamiliar?

972
00:35:08,476 --> 00:35:10,043
Why are you shocked?

973
00:35:10,976 --> 00:35:14,210
(Cluck Cluck Tour gives it another go)

974
00:35:14,210 --> 00:35:16,243
It tastes familiar.

975
00:35:17,443 --> 00:35:19,043
Don't you think there is hot pepper in it?

976
00:35:19,610 --> 00:35:21,376
It's a little spicy.

977
00:35:21,376 --> 00:35:22,143
Isn't it?

978
00:35:22,143 --> 00:35:22,910
It's tasty.

979
00:35:23,776 --> 00:35:25,343
It's something kids would love.

980
00:35:27,176 --> 00:35:28,776
(This is so good)

981
00:35:29,176 --> 00:35:31,276
I think we're going to win because of their reactions.

982
00:35:31,276 --> 00:35:32,776
That's right. Their reaction isn't that good.

983
00:35:32,776 --> 00:35:34,176
- That tasted good, right? / - Since they're men...

984
00:35:34,176 --> 00:35:35,376
Their reactions aren't very good.

985
00:35:35,376 --> 00:35:36,410
- We were... / - Wasn't it good?

986
00:35:36,410 --> 00:35:38,310
Food is only a small part for us.

987
00:35:38,310 --> 00:35:40,943
Food doesn't mean a lot to us.

988
00:35:40,943 --> 00:35:43,076
We'll show you just how important that small part is.

989
00:35:43,076 --> 00:35:43,843
That's right.

990
00:35:45,376 --> 00:35:46,343
Look at this bread.

991
00:35:46,343 --> 00:35:47,310
It's the lid.

992
00:35:48,210 --> 00:35:49,376
This is amazing.

993
00:35:51,143 --> 00:35:52,510
We have to eat this together.

994
00:35:54,076 --> 00:35:57,576
You have to eat the soup with the bread.

995
00:35:57,576 --> 00:35:58,610
Of course.

996
00:36:01,876 --> 00:36:05,476
(His eyebrows are dancing)

997
00:36:06,443 --> 00:36:07,543
It's better with the bread.

998
00:36:08,876 --> 00:36:10,976
(Should I taste this?)

999
00:36:12,510 --> 00:36:13,176
More crab?

1000
00:36:13,176 --> 00:36:14,376
That crab was amazing.

1001
00:36:15,243 --> 00:36:16,643
- I remember it. / - It's so big.

1002
00:36:17,176 --> 00:36:18,710
I thought it was a replica.

1003
00:36:19,876 --> 00:36:21,343
It's cooked in butter.

1004
00:36:22,576 --> 00:36:24,376
- It's so full of meat. / - You're right.

1005
00:36:25,276 --> 00:36:26,076
That looks so good.

1006
00:36:27,543 --> 00:36:29,243
(Chomp)

1007
00:36:31,176 --> 00:36:32,143
This is the good part.

1008
00:36:37,476 --> 00:36:40,076
(The corner of his mouth is going up again)

1009
00:36:40,876 --> 00:36:41,943
First...

1010
00:36:41,943 --> 00:36:44,310
It's completely full of meat.

1011
00:36:44,310 --> 00:36:47,743
I think they grilled it with butter.

1012
00:36:48,643 --> 00:36:51,110
It's greasier

1013
00:36:51,110 --> 00:36:54,143
and different to how it tastes in Korea.

1014
00:36:54,143 --> 00:36:55,210
There's no need for words.

1015
00:36:58,276 --> 00:36:58,976
I'm sorry.

1016
00:36:59,676 --> 00:37:01,410
Yura, I'm sorry.

1017
00:37:01,410 --> 00:37:02,410
Minah, I'm sorry.

1018
00:37:05,276 --> 00:37:06,643
He's teasing us.

1019
00:37:06,643 --> 00:37:07,710
Girl's Day, are you watching this?

1020
00:37:07,710 --> 00:37:08,876
Girl's Day?

1021
00:37:10,176 --> 00:37:11,110
(They are having so much fun teasing Girl's Day)

1022
00:37:11,443 --> 00:37:12,910
What if we faint from eating this

1023
00:37:12,910 --> 00:37:13,843
because it's so good?

1024
00:37:14,776 --> 00:37:15,910
Let's eat it all up.

1025
00:37:17,976 --> 00:37:19,810
Don't you think I'll look too greedy?

1026
00:37:19,810 --> 00:37:21,476
- Right now. / - Will you keep going?

1027
00:37:21,476 --> 00:37:23,043
Your face looks greasy.

1028
00:37:23,676 --> 00:37:25,143
Your face looks greasy.

1029
00:37:26,410 --> 00:37:27,310
Why you...

1030
00:37:27,310 --> 00:37:29,243
(KBS complies with the broadcasting regulations)

1031
00:37:31,443 --> 00:37:32,410
It was so good.

1032
00:37:32,410 --> 00:37:34,110
- The wine. / - You have to drink white wine.

1033
00:37:34,110 --> 00:37:36,410
- It goes well with seafood. / - Yeah.

1034
00:37:36,410 --> 00:37:37,876
- I can't say how good it was. / - Look so good.

1035
00:37:37,876 --> 00:37:40,110
Now we head to the Golden Gate Bridge...

1036
00:37:41,643 --> 00:37:42,810
I can see the Golden Gate Bridge from here.

1037
00:37:43,510 --> 00:37:45,176
Over there.

1038
00:37:45,176 --> 00:37:47,543
You can see it between the fog.

1039
00:37:47,543 --> 00:37:48,910
We're going to see it from up close.

1040
00:37:48,910 --> 00:37:51,010
You planned this trip really well.

1041
00:37:51,010 --> 00:37:52,443
Cluck Cluck Tour. Cheers.

1042
00:37:54,276 --> 00:37:54,976
Cheers.

(Golden Gate Bridge)

1045
00:38:02,343 --> 00:38:03,410
Golden Gate Bridge.

1046
00:38:03,410 --> 00:38:05,376
We have to see the Golden Gate Bridge.

1047
00:38:06,310 --> 00:38:07,810
It's really long.

1048
00:38:07,810 --> 00:38:08,810
That's right.

1049
00:38:08,810 --> 00:38:09,743
I went there by car and

1050
00:38:09,743 --> 00:38:12,610
the Golden Gate Bridge was the most memorable.

1051
00:38:12,610 --> 00:38:15,710
Even if people don't know the name correctly...

1052
00:38:16,476 --> 00:38:18,476
They've all seen it once.

1053
00:38:18,476 --> 00:38:20,110
- That's right. / - It's in a lot of movies.

1054
00:38:20,110 --> 00:38:23,310
There's a movie where aliens blow it up.

1055
00:38:23,310 --> 00:38:26,810
The NBA home team is the Golden State Warriors.

1056
00:38:26,810 --> 00:38:27,910
Who's on that team?

1057
00:38:27,910 --> 00:38:28,843
Stephen Curry.

1058
00:38:28,843 --> 00:38:30,776

1059
00:38:30,776 --> 00:38:32,976
On his chest

1060
00:38:32,976 --> 00:38:35,543
is the Golden Gate Bridge.

1061
00:38:36,310 --> 00:38:37,676
You have to buy things like a

1062
00:38:37,676 --> 00:38:39,776
Golden Gate Bridge snow globe.

1063
00:38:39,776 --> 00:38:41,210
When you boast that you

1064
00:38:41,210 --> 00:38:43,543
went on a San Francisco trip,

1065
00:38:43,543 --> 00:38:45,543
you have to show off things like that.

1066
00:38:45,543 --> 00:38:46,276
Have you ever been there?

1067
00:38:47,243 --> 00:38:48,210
I've been there.

1068
00:38:48,210 --> 00:38:49,776
Do you have to talk so tauntingly?

1069
00:38:49,776 --> 00:38:51,543
Why are you so taunting?

1070
00:38:51,543 --> 00:38:52,276
Okay.

1071
00:38:52,843 --> 00:38:53,776
Okay.

(When darkness falls in San Francisco)

1073
00:38:59,910 --> 00:39:01,943
It's the place we've only seen

1074
00:39:01,943 --> 00:39:03,576
in movies and pictures and we walked on it.

1075

- Isn't it too long to walk? / - Isn't it too long?

1076
00:39:05,376 --> 00:39:06,310
No, no. It's not that long.

1077
00:39:06,310 --> 00:39:08,010
- You can walk it in less than an hour. / - We're here!

1078
00:39:09,910 --> 00:39:11,610
Do you know why it's called this?

1079
00:39:11,610 --> 00:39:12,643
- This bridge? / - Yeah.

1080
00:39:12,643 --> 00:39:13,676
It's Golden Gate Bridge

1081
00:39:13,676 --> 00:39:14,710
Why is it Golden Gate?

1082
00:39:14,710 --> 00:39:16,076
- I know it. / - Why?

1083
00:39:16,076 --> 00:39:18,710
California was the place

1084
00:39:18,710 --> 00:39:20,243
where America had the gold rush.

1085
00:39:22,410 --> 00:39:23,310
You studied.

1087
00:39:27,243 --> 00:39:29,210
(San Francisco was called the Golden Gate)

00:39:38,943 --> 00:39:41,010
You see this bridge...

1093
00:39:41,010 --> 00:39:43,110
- In a lot of movies. / - Right.

1094
00:39:44,443 --> 00:39:46,043
Like in "X-Men."

1095
00:39:46,043 --> 00:39:48,810
Magneto lifts the bridge

1096
00:39:48,810 --> 00:39:52,043
with his magnetic powers.

1097
00:39:52,043 --> 00:39:53,343
He snaps it in the middle.

1098
00:39:53,343 --> 00:39:55,876
If this collapses in disaster films...

1099
00:39:56,610 --> 00:39:59,443
That means that it's the end of the world.

1100
00:39:59,443 --> 00:40:02,810
This bridge is not collapsible?

1101
00:40:02,810 --> 00:40:03,776
That's right.

1102
00:40:04,443 --> 00:40:06,076
This is really amazing.

1103
00:40:06,876 --> 00:40:09,143
If you want to take a picture, take it by that hill.

1104
00:40:09,143 --> 00:40:10,610
That's the Battery Spencer.

1105
00:40:16,610 --> 00:40:18,443
- That looks so nice. / - It's more beautiful at night.

1106
00:40:19,976 --> 00:40:22,076
It looks amazing from above.

1107
00:40:23,176 --> 00:40:24,010
So nice.

1108
00:40:24,010 --> 00:40:27,876
(Charmed by the view of the Golden Gate Bridge)

1109
00:40:29,410 --> 00:40:32,176
It's too bad that we're the only ones seeing this.

1110
00:40:35,543 --> 00:40:38,876
(The day in San Francisco passed by too quickly)

1111
00:40:39,310 --> 00:40:41,276
- We have to go there tomorrow. / - Where?

1112
00:40:41,276 --> 00:40:42,743
- Napa Valley. / - Ah.

1113
00:40:42,743 --> 00:40:44,810
We will go to Napa Valley tomorrow

1114
00:40:44,810 --> 00:40:47,410
and visit a winery.

1115
00:40:47,410 --> 00:40:50,043
We can taste wine there.

1116
00:40:50,043 --> 00:40:51,943
- We're looking forward to that. / - That's pretty.

1117
00:40:51,943 --> 00:40:53,910
The place I'm looking forward to the most...

1118
00:40:53,910 --> 00:40:56,043
- Yosemite National Park. / - Really?

1119
00:40:56,043 --> 00:40:57,510
One of the best three national parks.

1120
00:40:57,510 --> 00:40:59,376
It's completely preserved.

1121
00:40:59,376 --> 00:41:00,610
Wow, stars!

1122
00:41:00,610 --> 00:41:02,110
- What is that? / - That's what we actually saw.

1123
00:41:02,110 --> 00:41:04,343
That sky is really unforgettable.

1124
00:41:04,343 --> 00:41:06,543
It's hard to capture stars on camera.

1125
00:41:12,076 --> 00:41:14,076
Is it over already?

1126
00:41:14,076 --> 00:41:15,743
I've never been there, so I'm curious.

1127
00:41:15,743 --> 00:41:18,176
Is the Golden Gate Bridge really beautiful?

1128
00:41:18,176 --> 00:41:22,043
The Golden Gate Bridge... It's a marvelous sight.

1129
00:41:22,043 --> 00:41:23,910
But from the moment they planned the bridge,

1130
00:41:23,910 --> 00:41:26,410
people said it'd be impossible to build.

1131
00:41:26,410 --> 00:41:28,510
Because they only have two columns.

1132
00:41:28,510 --> 00:41:32,243
The entire bridge is suspended on cables.

1133
00:41:32,243 --> 00:41:34,276
- Does it shake? / - Of course it does.

1134
00:41:34,276 --> 00:41:36,143
It has to shake for it to be safe.

1135
00:41:36,143 --> 00:41:39,376
It has to vibrate to the airflow.

1136
00:41:39,376 --> 00:41:42,476
That's what makes the bridge stand firm.

1137
00:41:42,476 --> 00:41:44,076
Since it doesn't have columns...

1138
00:41:44,076 --> 00:41:46,176
- You can pass freely underneath. / - That's right.

1139
00:41:46,176 --> 00:41:48,710
The bridges we know have continuous supports.

1140
00:41:48,710 --> 00:41:51,443
- You're right. / - So after the bridge was built...

1141
00:41:51,443 --> 00:41:52,676
It was good for cars...

1142
00:41:52,676 --> 00:41:54,676
- But boats could also travel freely. / - Convenience.

1143
00:41:54,676 --> 00:41:55,876
San Francisco developed

1144
00:41:55,876 --> 00:41:58,743
because of the Golden Gate Bridge.

1145
00:41:58,743 --> 00:42:00,443
- I've been to San Francisco. / - Have you?

1146
00:42:00,443 --> 00:42:03,476
But for me...

1147
00:42:03,476 --> 00:42:07,010
- The croquette... / - Croquette?

1148
00:42:07,010 --> 00:42:09,543
It sounds weird if you talk about croquette.

1149
00:42:09,543 --> 00:42:11,143
- Crab cake. / - Yes, crab cake.

1150
00:42:11,143 --> 00:42:13,043
Yes, croquette, crab cake...

1151
00:42:13,043 --> 00:42:17,310
The crab was the most memorable dish for me.

1152
00:42:17,310 --> 00:42:20,143
In Korea, it's steamed or cooked.

1153
00:42:20,143 --> 00:42:20,876
They have variety.

1154
00:42:20,876 --> 00:42:23,443
They cook it in butter.

1155
00:42:23,443 --> 00:42:25,876
- That was different. / - That lid.

1156
00:42:25,876 --> 00:42:26,510
Yes.

1157
00:42:26,510 --> 00:42:27,510
It was really savory.

1158
00:42:27,510 --> 00:42:28,576
We've seen enough.

1159
00:42:28,576 --> 00:42:30,876
- Let's take a vote. / - Let's.

1160
00:42:30,876 --> 00:42:33,410
Would you go to Northern California

1161
00:42:33,410 --> 00:42:36,043
based on the Cluck Cluck Tour?

1162
00:42:36,043 --> 00:42:38,576
Yes or no? Please vote.

1163
00:42:39,576 --> 00:42:42,410
(Cluck Cluck Tour planned a trip to Northern California)

1164
00:42:42,410 --> 00:42:45,110
(What will the judges choose?)

1165
00:42:45,576 --> 00:42:47,443
- Small things can be better at times. / - Yeah.

1166
00:42:47,443 --> 00:42:50,810
- In my opinion, we'll get over 70. / - Really?

1167
00:42:50,810 --> 00:42:52,476
- Over 70 is a good thing. / - Take a look.

1168
00:42:52,476 --> 00:42:55,443
What? Why did you look at it so fast?

1169
00:42:55,443 --> 00:42:58,010
- The thing is... / - Do you have to look so fast?

1170
00:42:58,010 --> 00:42:59,043
There's no need to pretend.

1171
00:42:59,043 --> 00:43:00,443
Just look.

1172
00:43:01,576 --> 00:43:02,543
They're going to be like this.

1173
00:43:02,543 --> 00:43:04,810
They'll act before they even look.

1174
00:43:05,576 --> 00:43:08,810
- Cue. / - This was your doing.

1175
00:43:10,210 --> 00:43:12,343
You acted like you really liked it.

1176
00:43:12,343 --> 00:43:14,443
Look at them.

1177
00:43:14,443 --> 00:43:15,443
It's a high vote.

1178
00:43:15,443 --> 00:43:17,476
How many votes do you expect out of 100?

1179
00:43:17,476 --> 00:43:20,443
To be honest, the first video you saw...

1180
00:43:20,443 --> 00:43:23,443
- Is just all the boring stuff. / - That's right.

1181
00:43:23,443 --> 00:43:25,276
That was the boring stuff?

1182
00:43:25,276 --> 00:43:27,676
Seriously, Northern California...

1183
00:43:27,676 --> 00:43:30,310
You haven't seen anything yet.

1184
00:43:30,310 --> 00:43:32,943
Okay then. Let's begin the second half

1185
00:43:32,943 --> 00:43:34,576
of the Northern California trip.

1186
00:43:34,576 --> 00:43:35,676
Let's watch together.

1187
00:43:35,676 --> 00:43:37,710
- We watch all of it now? / - We start right away.

1188
00:43:38,976 --> 00:43:41,343
This place produces the most wine,

1189
00:43:41,343 --> 00:43:43,376
and it's most famous in California.

1190
00:43:43,376 --> 00:43:45,543
- I want to go there. / - You can take the train...

1191
00:43:45,543 --> 00:43:46,643
And have lunch.

1192
00:43:46,643 --> 00:43:49,110
Then visit the winery, try some wine,

1193
00:43:49,110 --> 00:43:50,843
look around, take pictures...

1194
00:43:50,843 --> 00:43:53,276
- You can only say wow. / - It's marvelous.

1195
00:43:53,276 --> 00:43:56,643
There's no way to express this in words.

1196
00:43:56,643 --> 00:43:58,276
This should all be frozen.

1197
00:43:58,276 --> 00:43:59,843
We were lucky.

1198
00:43:59,843 --> 00:44:01,110
It's supposed to be frozen during this time.

1199
00:44:01,943 --> 00:44:04,610
There wasn't any snow so the water didn't freeze.

1200
00:44:05,276 --> 00:44:07,310
I didn't know that it would be this moving.

1201
00:44:07,310 --> 00:44:08,810
This trip is unforgettable.

1202
00:44:09,176 --> 00:44:10,410
That's amazing.

1203
00:44:10,410 --> 00:44:12,610
- Is that on camera? / - Yes, captured on camera.

1204
00:44:14,410 --> 00:44:15,976
Cluck Cluck Tour, day 2.

1205
00:44:15,976 --> 00:44:17,376
We will start from Napa Valley.

1206
00:44:17,376 --> 00:44:19,776
Should we move? 1, 2, 3.

1207
00:44:20,310 --> 00:44:22,476
(Starting to do it the old-fashioned way again)

1208
00:44:22,476 --> 00:44:24,243
(We will start the second half of Northern California)

1209
00:44:24,243 --> 00:44:26,110
They said that they would edit it well for us.

1210
00:44:27,510 --> 00:44:28,910
Where should we go today?

1211
00:44:28,910 --> 00:44:31,643
I planned everything.

1212
00:44:31,643 --> 00:44:32,376
Where are we going?

1213
00:44:32,376 --> 00:44:34,743
This is an intermediate course

1214
00:44:34,743 --> 00:44:37,476
to visit the suburbs of San Francisco.

1215
00:44:37,476 --> 00:44:40,343
- Since you rented a convertible yesterday... / - Yes.

1216
00:44:40,343 --> 00:44:42,243
I rented a proper one today.

1217
00:44:42,243 --> 00:44:43,843
It's not a small car like yours.

1218
00:44:43,843 --> 00:44:46,976
They must have rented a proper car this time.

1219
00:44:47,743 --> 00:44:49,710
(Surprised)

1220
00:44:51,376 --> 00:44:53,376
(Rent and insurance for 1 day, $92)

1221
00:44:53,810 --> 00:44:55,476
We're entering the Golden Gate Bridge.

1222
00:44:56,076 --> 00:44:58,976
The Golden Gate Bridge in the fog looks amazing.

1223
00:44:58,976 --> 00:45:00,576
I feel like I can

1224
00:45:00,576 --> 00:45:02,843
high-five everyone in this convertible.

1225
00:45:04,343 --> 00:45:06,310
(Wine train)

1226
00:45:06,310 --> 00:45:08,610
I told you we put the boring stuff first.

1227
00:45:10,110 --> 00:45:11,810
1 hour 10 minutes is perfect.

1228
00:45:14,610 --> 00:45:16,610
- Good job. / - Good job.

1229
00:45:19,010 --> 00:45:21,376
This is the Napa Valley wine train.

1230
00:45:21,376 --> 00:45:22,210
It's written here.

1231
00:45:22,210 --> 00:45:23,976
It's 50 times bigger than Yeouido?

1232
00:45:23,976 --> 00:45:25,643
It's not 4 times, it's 50 times bigger.

1233
00:45:25,643 --> 00:45:27,110
Napa Valley wine train. It's written here.

1234
00:45:27,110 --> 00:45:27,910
It's the sacred place for wine.

1235
00:45:27,910 --> 00:45:28,576
The most famous place.

1236
00:45:28,576 --> 00:45:30,076
- It's the most famous? / - You take the train...

1237
00:45:30,076 --> 00:45:32,510
And eat food there. You can also go to the winery

1238
00:45:32,510 --> 00:45:34,476
to try some wine, look around and

1239
00:45:34,476 --> 00:45:35,276
take pictures.

1240
00:45:36,076 --> 00:45:38,343
It looks very old.

1241
00:45:38,876 --> 00:45:40,943
- It looks vintage. / - It looks luxurious.

1242
00:45:42,243 --> 00:45:45,243
(Wine train and winery tour, $333)

1243
00:45:45,243 --> 00:45:47,043
It's a winery tour on the wine train.

1244
00:45:47,043 --> 00:45:49,243
You can enjoy wine and food there.

1245
00:45:49,676 --> 00:45:54,110
It feels like there's a party in this train.

1246
00:45:54,110 --> 00:45:55,243
It's crowded and noisy.

1247
00:45:55,243 --> 00:45:57,310
Everyone looks so excited.

1248
00:45:57,310 --> 00:46:01,110
This would be paradise for people who love

1249
00:46:01,110 --> 00:46:02,776
wine or alcohol.

1250
00:46:02,776 --> 00:46:04,543
It'd be a train ride to heaven.

1251
00:46:05,843 --> 00:46:06,876
Wow, that's insane.

1252
00:46:07,076 --> 00:46:10,010
They already gave us some Champagne to drink

1253
00:46:10,010 --> 00:46:11,643
before our meal.

1254
00:46:11,643 --> 00:46:13,376
That Champagne looks so good.

1255
00:46:13,376 --> 00:46:14,343
Enjoy some wine.

1256
00:46:15,276 --> 00:46:16,510
Let's have fun.

1257
00:46:16,510 --> 00:46:18,376
Cheers to Napa Valley.

1258
00:46:23,110 --> 00:46:25,876
Can we drink on TV?

1259
00:46:25,876 --> 00:46:28,810
My face turns very suggestive when I drink.

1260
00:46:29,810 --> 00:46:32,976
You might have to censor my face.

1261
00:46:32,976 --> 00:46:34,443
Will I be the only one on TV?

1262
00:46:34,443 --> 00:46:36,043
Did I go on this trip by myself?

1263
00:46:36,043 --> 00:46:38,210
My face turns very suggestive.

1264
00:46:38,210 --> 00:46:41,676
It might be inappropriate for TV.

1265
00:46:41,676 --> 00:46:42,843
I'm warning you beforehand.

1266
00:46:44,843 --> 00:46:47,910
(What will become of Jihun's destiny?)

1267
00:46:48,910 --> 00:46:51,710
Your face is already pink.

1268
00:46:52,510 --> 00:46:54,310
It has started already.

1269
00:46:54,310 --> 00:46:56,410
I can't drink all the booze they give me today.

1270
00:46:56,410 --> 00:46:57,276
I'll just taste.

1271
00:46:58,176 --> 00:47:00,210
(No alcohol, good circulation, pink boy)

1272
00:47:01,076 --> 00:47:03,110
(Amazing)

1273
00:47:03,110 --> 00:47:04,476
Jihun!

1274
00:47:04,476 --> 00:47:05,843
Isn't that computer graphics?

1275
00:47:05,843 --> 00:47:06,976
I'll get revenge for you!

1276
00:47:06,976 --> 00:47:08,910
That's unbelievable.

1277
00:47:08,910 --> 00:47:10,010
(We can assure you that it's not computer graphics)

1278
00:47:11,410 --> 00:47:12,343
Our mains are here.

1279
00:47:15,176 --> 00:47:16,376
They serve you dishes like that?

1280
00:47:16,376 --> 00:47:20,143
You have a course meal with wine.

1281
00:47:20,143 --> 00:47:23,543
Then you go to the winery for a guided tour.

1282
00:47:23,543 --> 00:47:25,543
And you do tasting there too.

1283
00:47:26,343 --> 00:47:28,810
We're eating salmon and steak

1284
00:47:28,810 --> 00:47:30,043
on the train.

1285
00:47:31,810 --> 00:47:34,776
(Appetizing)

1286
00:47:35,543 --> 00:47:38,710
(Steak on wine train)

1287
00:47:39,776 --> 00:47:42,343
(They each try a bite)

1288
00:47:42,343 --> 00:47:45,076
I shouldn't have come here with you.

1289
00:47:45,076 --> 00:47:46,076
Why?

1290
00:47:46,076 --> 00:47:48,910
- I should be here with a woman. / - I'm happy with you.

1291
00:47:48,910 --> 00:47:49,910
Are you really happy?

1292
00:47:49,910 --> 00:47:51,476
(He's complaining he's here with a man)

1293
00:47:53,176 --> 00:47:54,343
In my opinion,

1294
00:47:54,343 --> 00:47:58,243
you have to look outside while eating your food.

1295
00:47:58,243 --> 00:48:00,843
(Show off)

1296
00:48:01,210 --> 00:48:05,010
Later on. You know steak this thick?

1297
00:48:05,010 --> 00:48:06,610
- This thick. / - I want to eat that.

1298
00:48:08,343 --> 00:48:09,110
Just wait.

1299
00:48:10,610 --> 00:48:12,810
(Something you've never seen)

1300
00:48:12,810 --> 00:48:13,476
What's wrong?

1301
00:48:13,476 --> 00:48:15,676
We would go crazy over that.

1302
00:48:15,676 --> 00:48:17,743
We're used to this.

1303
00:48:17,743 --> 00:48:19,010
Things like that are common in the U.S.

1304
00:48:20,710 --> 00:48:22,643
- It's good, right? / - It's to die for.

1305
00:48:22,643 --> 00:48:24,076
They're so bad at making it look appetizing.

1306
00:48:24,076 --> 00:48:27,176
That's me when I'm eating the tastiest food.

1307
00:48:27,176 --> 00:48:28,443
That's the face for the best food.

1308
00:48:28,443 --> 00:48:29,910
I should try the salmon.

1309
00:48:29,910 --> 00:48:32,710
The salmon will suit your taste.

1310
00:48:36,643 --> 00:48:40,143
(How does the salmon taste?)

1311
00:48:42,343 --> 00:48:43,443
Isn't this better for you?

1312
00:48:43,443 --> 00:48:45,976
- It's the best, right? / - I prefer the salmon.

1313
00:48:47,110 --> 00:48:49,943
Eat the salmon on the wine train.

1314
00:48:49,943 --> 00:48:52,276
Salmon was good. That place does good salmon.

1315
00:48:53,510 --> 00:48:54,910
The salmon is good.

1316
00:48:57,610 --> 00:48:59,543
The atmosphere is really good.

1317
00:49:01,210 --> 00:49:02,843
- We're here. / - Let's go.

1318
00:49:03,376 --> 00:49:04,276
Let's go.

1319
00:49:08,443 --> 00:49:09,510
I'm getting drunk.

1320
00:49:09,510 --> 00:49:11,543
Your face is too red.

1321
00:49:12,176 --> 00:49:15,176
(Suggestive pink boy is here)

1322
00:49:15,176 --> 00:49:17,110
What do we do?

1323
00:49:17,843 --> 00:49:19,376
One glass of Champagne?

1324
00:49:19,376 --> 00:49:20,976
I turn like this with only one glass of Champagne.

1325
00:49:20,976 --> 00:49:23,210
- He's just like Minah. / - One glass?

1326
00:49:23,210 --> 00:49:24,476
Same for her.

1327
00:49:24,976 --> 00:49:25,610
What will we do?

1328
00:49:25,610 --> 00:49:27,310
Pink boy, get with it.

1329
00:49:27,310 --> 00:49:29,976
- Let's consume some wine. / - I'll have it all!

1330
00:49:33,776 --> 00:49:36,643
(Winery)

1331
00:49:37,910 --> 00:49:39,810
This is the winery.

1332
00:49:39,810 --> 00:49:41,410
The weather is a little foggy,

1333
00:49:41,410 --> 00:49:44,443
but the fog, mountains,

1334
00:49:44,443 --> 00:49:46,076
and the vineyard look so good together.

1335
00:49:47,043 --> 00:49:49,143
If you come in summer...

1336
00:49:49,143 --> 00:49:51,410
- It'd be so good. / - It's magnificent.

1337
00:49:51,410 --> 00:49:53,576
There's a valley and a road.

1338
00:49:53,576 --> 00:49:56,210
The winery lines the road on both sides.

1339
00:49:56,210 --> 00:49:57,243
There is a picture of it.

1340
00:49:57,243 --> 00:49:59,276
If you come to a winery,

1341
00:49:59,276 --> 00:50:00,343
you can see that building.

1342
00:50:00,343 --> 00:50:01,910
It's this building here.

1343
00:50:02,776 --> 00:50:04,676
This is our guide.

1344
00:50:04,676 --> 00:50:06,710
- Hi. Good morning. / - Welcome.

1345
00:50:06,710 --> 00:50:08,276
Let me show you around the winery.

1346
00:50:08,276 --> 00:50:10,110
It's a beautiful day and

1347
00:50:10,110 --> 00:50:11,810
we have exciting wine to taste.

1348
00:50:13,443 --> 00:50:15,410
This is like a door leading to an unknown world.

1349
00:50:15,976 --> 00:50:16,976
This is so amazing.

1350
00:50:18,643 --> 00:50:21,476
(They can only make exclamations from surprise)

1351
00:50:21,476 --> 00:50:22,743
- Goodness. / - Wow.

1352
00:50:22,743 --> 00:50:23,610
Wonderful.

1353
00:50:24,810 --> 00:50:28,076
(This is the place where they age the wine)

1354
00:50:28,510 --> 00:50:30,676
- We reacted a lot here. / - One barrel costs...

1355
00:50:30,676 --> 00:50:32,043
In terms of currency,

1356
00:50:32,043 --> 00:50:34,176
that's $20,000 to $30,000 worth of wine in there.

1357
00:50:34,176 --> 00:50:36,976
This barrel yields 300 bottles of wine.

1358
00:50:37,910 --> 00:50:39,110
Present?

1359
00:50:39,110 --> 00:50:41,376
If one of these makes 300 bottles

1360
00:50:41,376 --> 00:50:43,076
and say 1 bottle costs $100...

1361
00:50:43,076 --> 00:50:46,410
- That's 100, 1,000, 10,000... / - Always calculating.

1362
00:50:46,410 --> 00:50:48,610
- One of these is worth $30,000. / - Really?

1363
00:50:48,610 --> 00:50:49,676
I wanted to bring a barrel home.

1364
00:50:49,676 --> 00:50:51,210
There's no end to the barrels lined up.

1365
00:50:51,210 --> 00:50:52,910
You should've bought one of those.

1366
00:50:53,376 --> 00:50:55,243
This is so...

1367
00:50:55,743 --> 00:50:57,043
Cluck Cluck Tour went to a nice place.

1368
00:50:57,043 --> 00:50:59,210
There are over 400 wineries there

1369
00:50:59,210 --> 00:51:00,810
and they're all like that.

1370
00:51:00,810 --> 00:51:02,476
The cellars are filled with wine.

1371
00:51:02,476 --> 00:51:04,310
- That's why it's 50 times the size of Yeouido. / - Right.

1372
00:51:04,310 --> 00:51:05,610
Let me try this.

1373
00:51:05,610 --> 00:51:07,443
Not this one.

1374
00:51:08,510 --> 00:51:11,410
I can take it.

1375
00:51:14,343 --> 00:51:17,510
(How about a tasting instead of the oak barrel?)

1376
00:51:18,376 --> 00:51:19,643
I feel like I'm going to get drunk already.

1377
00:51:19,643 --> 00:51:21,943
I'm drunk on the smell of wine.

1378
00:51:21,943 --> 00:51:25,410
So, let me show you some of the beautiful wines

1379
00:51:25,410 --> 00:51:27,876
that we make here at Robert Mondavi Winery.

1380
00:51:28,310 --> 00:51:31,710
I'd like to start with a white wine.

1381
00:51:31,776 --> 00:51:36,143
The name of this wine is Fume Blanc.

1382
00:51:36,543 --> 00:51:38,676
Wine tastes better if you listen

1383
00:51:38,676 --> 00:51:40,643
to the explanation and talk...

1384
00:51:40,643 --> 00:51:42,510
- In a quiet place. / - Very true.

1385
00:51:42,510 --> 00:51:43,843
You can taste it better.

1386
00:51:43,843 --> 00:51:46,410
I was resentful of how little I could drink.

1387
00:51:48,610 --> 00:51:49,643
(Focused and serious)

1388
00:51:50,910 --> 00:51:55,143
(Show off, the eyes, wine tastes good)

1389
00:51:55,710 --> 00:51:57,276
Now taste again.

1390
00:51:57,276 --> 00:51:59,076
You need to taste again to know the flavor.

1391
00:52:00,076 --> 00:52:01,410
(We're looking forward to pink boy's wine tasting)

1392
00:52:01,410 --> 00:52:03,076
Pink boy, go, go.

1393
00:52:03,076 --> 00:52:04,943
- Pink boy, go, go... / - Pink boy.

1394
00:52:06,043 --> 00:52:07,276
- It's good. / - It's tasty.

1395
00:52:08,476 --> 00:52:11,343
This refreshes your palate.

1396
00:52:11,343 --> 00:52:13,710
- It makes you salivate. / - Right?

1397
00:52:13,710 --> 00:52:15,176
It stimulates your appetite.

1398
00:52:15,176 --> 00:52:17,276
I like this Fume Blanc very much.

1399
00:52:17,776 --> 00:52:19,843
Isn't she waiting for us to finish?

1400
00:52:19,843 --> 00:52:22,010
- Is she? / - She's waiting for you.

1401
00:52:24,676 --> 00:52:27,376
Our elder is waiting for you to finish.

1402
00:52:27,376 --> 00:52:30,043
So you can throw it out if you can't drink?

1403
00:52:30,043 --> 00:52:31,610
But it was too good to throw out.

1404
00:52:31,610 --> 00:52:32,976
- Why throw away good drink? / - They're nice wine.

1405
00:52:32,976 --> 00:52:34,543
You're going to get wasted.

1406
00:52:34,543 --> 00:52:37,243
You're going to meet a new pink boy.

1407
00:52:37,576 --> 00:52:40,410
This is a very special wine for us.

1408
00:52:40,410 --> 00:52:41,876
I saw what kind of grapes it used

1409
00:52:41,876 --> 00:52:43,176
but it's not written on the bottle.

1410
00:52:43,176 --> 00:52:44,510
They blended it exquisitely.

1411
00:52:44,510 --> 00:52:47,776
You should continue to make the wine

1412
00:52:47,776 --> 00:52:50,310
contact with air to age the wine.

1413
00:52:51,010 --> 00:52:52,343
It will taste more mature.

1414
00:52:52,343 --> 00:52:53,443
It comes to life.

1415
00:52:53,443 --> 00:52:55,810
I've never seen anyone do this with wine?

1416
00:52:55,810 --> 00:52:58,243
He's shaking the wine like soju.

1417
00:52:58,243 --> 00:53:01,110
- He's shaking it like soju. / - It adds depth to the flavor.

1418
00:53:01,110 --> 00:53:03,910
I guess you've never had wine before.

1419
00:53:03,910 --> 00:53:05,443
You only have to shake it gently.

1420
00:53:06,576 --> 00:53:09,110
(What will pink boy do?)

1421
00:53:10,043 --> 00:53:11,310
I don't know.

1422
00:53:13,676 --> 00:53:16,010
(He tastes it again)

1423
00:53:16,643 --> 00:53:19,010
(Pink boy saw a lot of people do things like this)

1424
00:53:20,276 --> 00:53:21,843
You're trying too hard.

1425
00:53:21,843 --> 00:53:23,843
Sommeliers do it like this.

1426
00:53:25,076 --> 00:53:27,043
(We apologize for the image being too suggestive)

1427
00:53:28,243 --> 00:53:29,843
He turned red again.

1428
00:53:31,676 --> 00:53:32,776
(Cabernet Sauvignon Reserve)

1429
00:53:32,776 --> 00:53:34,176
- That must be so nice. / - I want to try it.

1430
00:53:34,176 --> 00:53:35,010
I know.

1431
00:53:36,443 --> 00:53:37,143
That's so interesting.

1432
00:53:37,143 --> 00:53:38,776
If you go there in the summer,

1433
00:53:38,776 --> 00:53:40,243
you can see the grapes for yourself.

1434
00:53:40,243 --> 00:53:41,776
Then you can taste the wine

1435
00:53:41,776 --> 00:53:43,276
that's made from those grapes.

1436
00:53:43,276 --> 00:53:44,143
That's nice.

1437
00:53:44,143 --> 00:53:46,210
- Lamb meatballs. / - It's lamb meatballs.

1438
00:53:47,410 --> 00:53:51,310
(A bite of meatball first)

1439
00:53:51,310 --> 00:53:53,943
(And then a sip of wine)

1440
00:53:55,043 --> 00:53:56,710
(Eyebrows going up again)

1441
00:53:56,710 --> 00:53:57,576
It goes well together.

1442
00:53:58,976 --> 00:54:00,143
Mmm.

1443
00:54:00,143 --> 00:54:01,576
Talk after you swallow.

1444
00:54:01,576 --> 00:54:03,576
It's sour. Why is it so sour?

1445
00:54:03,576 --> 00:54:05,510
- What's in it? / - Balsamic sauce.

1446
00:54:06,510 --> 00:54:07,676
I think I'm too drunk.

1447
00:54:13,476 --> 00:54:15,043
(Focusing)

1448
00:54:16,110 --> 00:54:17,410
Why's everything so sour?

1449
00:54:17,410 --> 00:54:18,510
(He's out of it)

1450
00:54:20,576 --> 00:54:22,510
- Should we toast and head off? / - Let's leave.

1451
00:54:23,376 --> 00:54:24,310
- Cluck. / - Cluck.

1452
00:54:24,310 --> 00:54:24,810
Cluck.

1453
00:54:24,810 --> 00:54:26,310
Cheers.

1454
00:54:26,310 --> 00:54:28,576
Did she just say cheers in Korean?

1455
00:54:28,576 --> 00:54:30,510
- She learned it from us. / - That's cute.

1456
00:54:30,510 --> 00:54:32,976
- We taught her. / - "Cheers."

1457
00:54:34,476 --> 00:54:36,276
This looks really nice.

1458
00:54:36,276 --> 00:54:38,310
- I've never been to Yosemite National Park. / - Same.

1459
00:54:38,310 --> 00:54:40,276
I really want to go there.

1460
00:54:40,276 --> 00:54:41,910
With the grandness of nature...

1461
00:54:41,910 --> 00:54:43,876
When we stand before it...

1462
00:54:43,876 --> 00:54:45,343
- We become small? / - We become very small.

1463
00:54:45,343 --> 00:54:47,010
I wanted to experience that.

1464
00:54:47,243 --> 00:54:49,543
Where the trees are thick

1465
00:54:49,543 --> 00:54:52,443
and there are streams or waterfalls.

1466
00:54:52,443 --> 00:54:54,710
- I want to feel that. / - Sounds great.

1467
00:54:57,776 --> 00:55:02,143
(Yosemite National Park)

1468
00:55:03,110 --> 00:55:05,276
This is the real start.

1469
00:55:05,276 --> 00:55:07,776
- Is this the start? / - It's the highlight of this tour.

1470
00:55:07,776 --> 00:55:08,610
Wow, what's that?

1471
00:55:09,843 --> 00:55:10,910
Isn't that a Winter Wonderland?

1472
00:55:10,910 --> 00:55:14,376
I feel like I'm being influenced by this nature

1473
00:55:14,376 --> 00:55:15,810
and endorphins are being released.

1474
00:55:17,043 --> 00:55:20,510
Look at the trees in the grandness of nature.

1475
00:55:20,510 --> 00:55:22,876
This place is just a landscape painting.

1476
00:55:22,876 --> 00:55:25,176
They have concerts there too.

1477
00:55:25,176 --> 00:55:26,976
- You're right. / - Really?

1478
00:55:26,976 --> 00:55:28,676
- Like Kenny Loggins... / - Really?

1479
00:55:28,676 --> 00:55:30,410
- And Michael McDonald / - I've seen it before.

1480
00:55:30,410 --> 00:55:33,143
That'd be amazing to have a concert there.

1481
00:55:33,143 --> 00:55:34,576
They have a lot of video concerts.

1482
00:55:35,110 --> 00:55:37,376
That's incredible.

1483
00:55:38,476 --> 00:55:39,843
1, 2, 3.

1484
00:55:39,843 --> 00:55:40,910
Pop.

1485
00:55:42,243 --> 00:55:44,743
(Awkward)

1486
00:55:46,210 --> 00:55:47,376
You didn't edit it, did you?

1487
00:55:48,610 --> 00:55:50,410
- You made us look like fools, right? / - Embarrassing.

1488
00:55:50,410 --> 00:55:51,243
Seriously.

1489
00:55:51,243 --> 00:55:53,776
Check out the trees.

1490
00:55:54,276 --> 00:55:56,310
This is the size of a pine tree.

1491
00:55:56,310 --> 00:55:58,376
- This... / - Let's try hugging this tree together.

1492
00:55:58,376 --> 00:55:59,310
I can't reach your hands.

1493
00:55:59,310 --> 00:56:01,710
- It's so big. / - Jihun, where are you?

1494
00:56:01,710 --> 00:56:04,443
- But it's just a normal tree here. / - I'm here.

1495
00:56:05,776 --> 00:56:07,476
- Am I cute? / - What?

1496
00:56:09,876 --> 00:56:11,743
I think I hear something strange.

1497
00:56:11,743 --> 00:56:12,810
I hear something echoing.

1498
00:56:12,810 --> 00:56:15,310
There's a place we need to visit first

1499
00:56:15,310 --> 00:56:16,410
in Yosemite National Park.

1500
00:56:16,943 --> 00:56:18,476
We're going to see a waterfall.

1501
00:56:18,476 --> 00:56:20,210
- Waterfall. / - There's a waterfall there?

1502
00:56:20,210 --> 00:56:21,410
Listen carefully.

1503
00:56:21,910 --> 00:56:23,876
- Splash, splash. / - I hear it.

1504
00:56:23,876 --> 00:56:25,276
- You can hear it, right? / - Yeah.

1505
00:56:25,276 --> 00:56:27,910
There's a waterfall over there.

1506
00:56:27,910 --> 00:56:29,843
You can see it through the trees.

1507
00:56:29,843 --> 00:56:30,643
Let's go.

1508
00:56:30,643 --> 00:56:33,843
- That's 720m high. / - That's really incredible.

1509
00:56:33,843 --> 00:56:34,676
What?

1510
00:56:34,676 --> 00:56:37,476
It's like a 300-story skyscraper.

1511
00:56:37,476 --> 00:56:39,176
- 300-story? / - 300-story?

1512
00:56:39,176 --> 00:56:40,976
(Let's go see the waterfall)

1513
00:56:43,176 --> 00:56:44,510
Can you see the waterfall?

1514
00:56:45,176 --> 00:56:45,943
Girl's Day.

1515
00:56:45,943 --> 00:56:47,676
They keep teasing us.

1516
00:56:48,576 --> 00:56:51,543
They keep competing with us.

1517
00:56:52,476 --> 00:56:53,143
It looks amazing.

1518
00:56:53,143 --> 00:56:56,176
- Let's take a photo in front of it. / - Okay.

1519
00:56:58,676 --> 00:57:03,610
(The sun shines through the thick forest)

1520
00:57:06,943 --> 00:57:09,076
I can feel the difference in the air on my skin.

1521
00:57:11,510 --> 00:57:13,876
The sound is getting louder.

1522
00:57:14,843 --> 00:57:17,610
(Here is the magnificent scenery made by nature)

1523
00:57:21,943 --> 00:57:23,610
(Yosemite Falls)

1524
00:57:23,610 --> 00:57:25,310
It looks amazing.

1525
00:57:27,676 --> 00:57:33,210
(Its magnificent view attracts many tourists)

1526
00:57:33,210 --> 00:57:35,076
It's so huge.

1527
00:57:35,643 --> 00:57:38,076
It's jaw-dropping.

1528
00:57:38,076 --> 00:57:39,843
We can take the picture here.

1529
00:57:39,843 --> 00:57:42,776
We can make us look like drinking the waterfall.

1530
00:57:42,776 --> 00:57:45,843
- You're right. / - I'll take the photo of you.

1531
00:57:46,643 --> 00:57:48,410
- Do we have to do this? / - Wait.

1532
00:57:48,410 --> 00:57:49,243
Just hang on a second.

1533
00:57:49,243 --> 00:57:51,443
The waterfall is actually really far away from us.

1534
00:57:52,876 --> 00:57:56,643
We used to do that in grade school.

1535
00:57:56,643 --> 00:57:58,110
- Is this a prank? / - Wait.

1536
00:57:58,110 --> 00:58:00,710
Just a minute. You look great.

1537
00:58:00,710 --> 00:58:02,076
Open your mouth wider.

1538
00:58:02,076 --> 00:58:04,776
- It's painful. / - Lean further back. There you go.

1539
00:58:04,776 --> 00:58:05,976
There you go. Perfect!

1540
00:58:05,976 --> 00:58:08,643
There it goes. It goes into your mouth.

1541
00:58:08,643 --> 00:58:10,743
- I'm done. / - Did you really take a picture?

1542
00:58:10,743 --> 00:58:12,143
- Hey. / - Of course I did.

1543
00:58:12,143 --> 00:58:14,210
I got fooled.

1544
00:58:14,210 --> 00:58:15,876
It was hard.

1545
00:58:15,876 --> 00:58:17,743
Hang in there. You look great now.

1546
00:58:17,743 --> 00:58:19,043
It was a video?

1547
00:58:19,043 --> 00:58:21,443
- Doesn't it look quite real? / - That was good.

1548
00:58:21,443 --> 00:58:24,143
Let's take a normal picture here. Come up here.

1549
00:58:24,143 --> 00:58:25,043
Okay.

1550
00:58:25,943 --> 00:58:28,410
(They look friendly)

1551
00:58:28,410 --> 00:58:29,476
Do we look too close?

1552
00:58:30,576 --> 00:58:33,343
(They should let others take photos for them)

1553
00:58:35,676 --> 00:58:36,643
What is this?

1554
00:58:36,643 --> 00:58:37,976
I went all the way to the end.

1555
00:58:37,976 --> 00:58:39,910
I got close to the waterfall on my own.

1556
00:58:40,843 --> 00:58:43,776
I'm here to show you exactly where

1557
00:58:43,776 --> 00:58:45,776
the Yosemite Falls flows from.

1558
00:58:45,776 --> 00:58:47,543
The water is falling from above.

1559
00:58:48,243 --> 00:58:51,276
All the way down.

1560
00:58:52,510 --> 00:58:54,710
Do you see the mist?

1561
00:58:54,710 --> 00:58:56,543
It's so moist.

1562
00:58:56,543 --> 00:58:58,343
You filmed a cosmetic commercial.

1563
00:58:58,343 --> 00:59:00,910
- Feels nice. / - It's so nice.

1564
00:59:01,676 --> 00:59:03,743
(I will keep my skin bright and moist)

1565
00:59:04,443 --> 00:59:06,410
Moisture fully charged!

1566
00:59:08,876 --> 00:59:11,810
- I'm so hungry. / - Me too. Wait.

1567
00:59:11,810 --> 00:59:13,876
I wish I could teleport down there.

1568
00:59:13,876 --> 00:59:15,943
1, 2, 3.

1569
00:59:16,743 --> 00:59:17,710
Now let's go.

1570
00:59:19,210 --> 00:59:23,643
(Yosemite Falls, "M" hotel restaurant)

1571
00:59:24,943 --> 00:59:26,543
Where are we now?

1572
00:59:26,543 --> 00:59:28,376
This is where we will have lunch.

1573
00:59:29,243 --> 00:59:32,376
This place is amazing too.

1574
00:59:32,376 --> 00:59:33,476
Is that inside the park?

1575
00:59:33,743 --> 00:59:35,076
Yes, it's a hotel.

1576
00:59:35,076 --> 00:59:36,010
Oh, my God.

1577
00:59:36,743 --> 00:59:38,643
(Its beauty is indescribable)

1578
00:59:38,643 --> 00:59:40,710
- I wish I could stay there once. / - It's pretty.

1579
00:59:40,710 --> 00:59:42,976
- It's so pretty. / - It's a 100-year-old hotel.

1580
00:59:44,143 --> 00:59:46,043
(This hotel is)

1581
00:59:46,043 --> 00:59:48,910
President Obama stayed here with his family.

1582
00:59:48,910 --> 00:59:50,110
Really?

1583
00:59:50,110 --> 00:59:53,610
And Steve Jobs had a wedding in this hotel.

1584
00:59:54,776 --> 00:59:56,876
When it's peak season, you can't make reservations.

1585
00:59:56,876 --> 00:59:59,510
Fortunately, we were very lucky.

1586
00:59:59,510 --> 01:00:01,376
It's off-season now,

1587
01:00:01,376 --> 01:00:02,510
so we could make a reservation.

1588
01:00:03,310 --> 01:00:05,810
It's so popular but we're here since it's off-season?

1589
01:00:06,176 --> 01:00:08,310
- Let's go eat. / - Let's go in.

1590
01:00:08,310 --> 01:00:10,143
What a relief.

1591
01:00:10,143 --> 01:00:13,676
Yura. Minah.

1592
01:00:13,676 --> 01:00:15,676
- I'm sorry you couldn't come here. / - I know.

1593
01:00:15,676 --> 01:00:17,843
We didn't record anything for you guys.

1594
01:00:17,843 --> 01:00:19,343
You didn't even think of us, did you?

1595
01:00:20,210 --> 01:00:23,076
(They're done looking at the building)

1596
01:00:24,576 --> 01:00:26,810
The restaurant was awesome.

1597
01:00:26,810 --> 01:00:28,143
Why is it so big?

1598
01:00:28,143 --> 01:00:30,376
- Fake candles. / - It was really grand.

1599
01:00:33,643 --> 01:00:35,376
It looks very elegant.

1600
01:00:35,776 --> 01:00:38,143
The high ceiling makes the atmosphere

1601
01:00:38,143 --> 01:00:40,710
so nice because it's so high.

1602
01:00:40,710 --> 01:00:42,976
We were overwhelmed by Yosemite Falls earlier.

1603
01:00:42,976 --> 01:00:45,443
Now we are overwhelmed by the restaurant.

1604
01:00:46,243 --> 01:00:49,676
With this size, it's impossible that they have bad food.

1605
01:00:50,610 --> 01:00:52,243
(The food is here)

1606
01:00:52,243 --> 01:00:55,376
- Look at how big it is. / - What is that?

1607
01:00:55,376 --> 01:00:56,410
Is that a sandwich?

1608
01:00:59,443 --> 01:01:01,776
Wow, seriously.

1609
01:01:01,776 --> 01:01:04,310
- The visuals... / - The serving size...

1610
01:01:04,310 --> 01:01:06,076
That was incredible.

1611
01:01:06,076 --> 01:01:08,410
Americans have such huge serving sizes.

1612
01:01:08,410 --> 01:01:10,310
Please describe the food properly this time.

1613
01:01:12,376 --> 01:01:16,310
(Onion soup goes well with the cold weather)

1614
01:01:18,710 --> 01:01:21,310
- Look at how great it looks. / - Chewy cheese.

1615
01:01:22,143 --> 01:01:24,876
- There was bread inside. / - It was really good.

1616
01:01:28,676 --> 01:01:30,243
- Please. / - Please, this time.

1617
01:01:30,243 --> 01:01:32,310
- Please show some reaction. / - Express it well.

1618
01:01:32,310 --> 01:01:33,243
Please make it look tasty.

1619
01:01:35,276 --> 01:01:37,810
This is the best men can do.

1620
01:01:37,810 --> 01:01:39,210
- That's the best we could do. / - Was that it?

1621
01:01:39,210 --> 01:01:40,010
Is it over?

1622
01:01:40,010 --> 01:01:41,543
We really enjoyed it.

1623
01:01:41,543 --> 01:01:44,643
That's a face of enjoying the every little bit of it.

1624
01:01:44,643 --> 01:01:46,410
It's a little lacking.

1625
01:01:46,410 --> 01:01:48,610
- So what is in the soup? / - One more time...

1626
01:01:48,610 --> 01:01:49,810
- So... / - This time?

1627
01:01:49,810 --> 01:01:52,310
Of all the food I've tasted in the U.S.,

1628
01:01:52,310 --> 01:01:54,143
the onion soup is the best.

1629
01:01:54,143 --> 01:01:55,776
- It's the best? / - This is the best.

1630
01:01:55,776 --> 01:01:56,410
It's over.

1631
01:01:56,743 --> 01:01:58,043
(That's your best effort?)

1632
01:01:58,576 --> 01:02:03,343
The bread is in here with cheese to bulk it up.

1633
01:02:04,143 --> 01:02:05,076
It's delicious.

1634
01:02:07,410 --> 01:02:08,643
Should we try the trout?

1635
01:02:08,643 --> 01:02:10,510
This looks like a really nice restaurant.

1636
01:02:10,510 --> 01:02:11,510
It's trout steak this time.

1637
01:02:11,510 --> 01:02:14,110
I have never tried trout steak before

1638
01:02:14,110 --> 01:02:16,576
but it was the best fish dish I had

1639
01:02:16,576 --> 01:02:18,010
in any restaurant

1640
01:02:18,010 --> 01:02:19,143
I've ever been to.

1641
01:02:20,910 --> 01:02:21,676
Pink, pink.

1642
01:02:22,543 --> 01:02:24,010
Just like my face when I'm drunk.

1643
01:02:28,076 --> 01:02:30,310
(He takes a bite of the pink trout steak)

1644
01:02:33,110 --> 01:02:34,876
It's not fishy at all.

1645
01:02:34,876 --> 01:02:36,043
It tastes very clean.

1646
01:02:37,010 --> 01:02:39,243
The meat is so chewy.

1647
01:02:39,243 --> 01:02:41,510
Compared to salmon,

1648
01:02:41,510 --> 01:02:42,743
it tastes cleaner

1649
01:02:42,743 --> 01:02:43,876
and less oily.

1650
01:02:43,876 --> 01:02:44,676
It's the best.

1651
01:02:44,676 --> 01:02:46,210
- No. 1? / - No. 1 for me.

1652
01:02:47,676 --> 01:02:48,776
- Please. / - Please.

1653
01:02:51,310 --> 01:02:54,010
(This is the best they can do)

1654
01:02:54,176 --> 01:02:55,043
I can't stop eating it.

1655
01:02:55,776 --> 01:02:56,710
Look at this.

1656
01:02:56,710 --> 01:02:58,610
That's our best expression.

1657
01:02:58,610 --> 01:02:59,910
It means the food makes them speechless.

1658
01:02:59,910 --> 01:03:00,810
There's no need for words.

1659
01:03:00,810 --> 01:03:02,943
You just need to keep eating.

1660
01:03:02,943 --> 01:03:04,776
Does the skin have more nutrition?

1661
01:03:07,810 --> 01:03:08,810
Look at this.

1662
01:03:08,810 --> 01:03:10,976
You're really good at separating the skin.

1663
01:03:11,843 --> 01:03:14,010
Did I uncover it too well?

1664
01:03:14,010 --> 01:03:15,076
Did I uncover it too well?

1665
01:03:15,676 --> 01:03:16,710
Goodness.

1666
01:03:16,710 --> 01:03:17,576
Are you lonely these days?

1667
01:03:19,010 --> 01:03:22,010
(This is who Jihun is)

1668
01:03:22,010 --> 01:03:23,776
You're red even though you didn't drink alcohol.

1669
01:03:25,110 --> 01:03:26,876
You can be pink without drinking alcohol.

1670
01:03:28,643 --> 01:03:29,843
Did someone spike the trout?

1671
01:03:31,710 --> 01:03:33,276
- Let's try the cheese steak. / - Yeah.

1672
01:03:33,276 --> 01:03:34,143
This is so...

1673
01:03:34,143 --> 01:03:36,610
This can be photographed

1674
01:03:36,610 --> 01:03:38,976
and be on the menu right away.

1675
01:03:38,976 --> 01:03:40,310
That is America.

1676
01:03:41,543 --> 01:03:43,510
(Why does he pick it up?)

1677
01:03:43,876 --> 01:03:45,076
Girl's Day, are you watching?

1678
01:03:45,776 --> 01:03:48,576
Why do you keep saying that?

1679
01:03:55,943 --> 01:03:58,410
Since you're a really big senior,

1680
01:03:58,410 --> 01:03:59,843
they'll be uncomfortable.

1681
01:03:59,843 --> 01:04:01,443
When they were in...

1682
01:04:01,443 --> 01:04:02,543
You can stop now.

1683
01:04:02,543 --> 01:04:03,776
Let's just enjoy the food.

1684
01:04:03,776 --> 01:04:05,776
You debuted before they started school.

1685
01:04:05,776 --> 01:04:06,976
It's all done now.

1686
01:04:07,710 --> 01:04:08,776
You cut it up well.

1687
01:04:10,010 --> 01:04:11,543
Jihun cut up the food really well.

1688
01:04:12,743 --> 01:04:13,776
Let me try it.

1689
01:04:13,776 --> 01:04:15,843
- Let's eat. / - This is meant to be...

1690
01:04:15,843 --> 01:04:17,043
The most popular dish here.

1691
01:04:18,543 --> 01:04:20,743
It's not that expensive.

1692
01:04:22,010 --> 01:04:23,976
That's a good reaction.

1693
01:04:23,976 --> 01:04:24,976
- Good. / - I tried.

1694
01:04:24,976 --> 01:04:26,310
It's not too expensive.

1695
01:04:26,310 --> 01:04:28,176
It looks so delicious. Suddenly it looks delicious.

1696
01:04:28,176 --> 01:04:30,576
It's the same price as any local restaurant.

1697
01:04:30,576 --> 01:04:31,510
The trout is better.

1698
01:04:31,510 --> 01:04:32,410
Is it?

1699
01:04:35,410 --> 01:04:36,543
The trout does look better.

1700
01:04:38,043 --> 01:04:39,343
- Seriously that trout... / - They don't match.

1701
01:04:39,343 --> 01:04:41,376
The best fish of my life.

1702
01:04:41,376 --> 01:04:42,910
- Now... / - What?

1703
01:04:42,910 --> 01:04:44,710
Let's pick what we think is the best dish.

1704
01:04:44,710 --> 01:04:45,976
- Best dish? / - My best dish.

1705
01:04:45,976 --> 01:04:46,810
Let's choose one each.

1706
01:04:46,810 --> 01:04:48,210
I'll give you the choices.

1707
01:04:48,210 --> 01:04:49,610
1. Onion soup.

1708
01:04:49,610 --> 01:04:51,810
2. Cheese steak sandwich.

1709
01:04:51,810 --> 01:04:53,476
3. Trout steak.

1710
01:04:53,476 --> 01:04:54,643
Now choose.

1711
01:04:54,643 --> 01:04:56,143
1, 2, 3.

1712
01:04:56,143 --> 01:04:57,676
1, 2, 3.

1713
01:04:58,276 --> 01:04:59,710
(1. Onion soup, 2. Cheese steak, 3. Trout)

1714
01:04:59,710 --> 01:05:00,676
- No. 3! / - No. 3!

1715
01:05:02,410 --> 01:05:05,276
(Trout steak wins 1st place)

1716
01:05:06,843 --> 01:05:08,710
There's no need for words.

1717
01:05:08,710 --> 01:05:10,743
The trout is the best.

1718
01:05:10,743 --> 01:05:12,610
Though it's hard to get here,

1719
01:05:12,610 --> 01:05:15,043
some people visit this place.

1720
01:05:15,043 --> 01:05:17,443
Those people must

1721
01:05:17,443 --> 01:05:18,843
order this trout dish.

1722
01:05:18,843 --> 01:05:19,676
It's really good.

1723
01:05:21,076 --> 01:05:22,610
- Can I take the last piece? / - Sure.

1724
01:05:26,576 --> 01:05:27,943
Let's go.

1725
01:05:27,943 --> 01:05:29,376
The atmosphere there is great.

1726
01:05:29,376 --> 01:05:30,343
- It's just... / - Just...

1727
01:05:30,343 --> 01:05:31,843
- Even the ceiling. / - It's just a different world.

1728
01:05:31,843 --> 01:05:32,676
Just nature.

1729
01:05:32,676 --> 01:05:34,143
- So vast. / - The hotel itself...

1730
01:05:36,176 --> 01:05:37,976
Isn't this place really amazing?

1731
01:05:37,976 --> 01:05:40,210
This place...

1732
01:05:40,210 --> 01:05:42,310
I can't express it in words.

1733
01:05:42,310 --> 01:05:43,876
This place makes me feel small...

1734
01:05:43,876 --> 01:05:46,443
Being between huge rocks like these.

1735
01:05:47,276 --> 01:05:49,710
This is the biggest rock in the world.

1736
01:05:49,710 --> 01:05:51,343
This is a rock? It's not a mountain?

1737
01:05:52,176 --> 01:05:55,643
Only masters of rock climbing attempt this rock.

1738
01:05:55,643 --> 01:05:58,443
While climbing, they hang there and take a break.

1739
01:05:58,443 --> 01:06:01,043
I heard that's how they climb this rock.

1740
01:06:01,043 --> 01:06:01,943
In February only,

1741
01:06:01,943 --> 01:06:03,643
when there's a sunset,

1742
01:06:03,643 --> 01:06:06,376
you can see the fire fall here.

1743
01:06:06,376 --> 01:06:07,176
What is that?

1744
01:06:07,176 --> 01:06:09,010
It's the sunset.

1745
01:06:09,010 --> 01:06:10,810
Only at a certain time, it reflects off the wall like that.

1746
01:06:10,810 --> 01:06:11,776
- I thought it was lava. / - Me too.

1747
01:06:11,776 --> 01:06:13,210
- I thought it was lava. / - Fire fall.

1748
01:06:13,210 --> 01:06:15,410
It's called fire fall.

1749
01:06:18,776 --> 01:06:20,443
I think I can't see it properly

1750
01:06:20,443 --> 01:06:21,376
because we're too close.

1751
01:06:21,376 --> 01:06:22,843
Let's look from further away.

1752
01:06:22,843 --> 01:06:24,143
- Should we? / - Let's step back.

1753
01:06:24,143 --> 01:06:26,710
We're surrounded by huge rocks here.

1754
01:06:28,710 --> 01:06:31,476
This place is really incredible.

1755
01:06:31,476 --> 01:06:32,976
It's so cool.

1756
01:06:32,976 --> 01:06:34,876
It looks like it's made

1757
01:06:34,876 --> 01:06:36,510
by a meteor crash.

1758
01:06:38,610 --> 01:06:40,976
I'm so glad I get to experience this in my life.

1759
01:06:40,976 --> 01:06:42,176
You can shoot

1760
01:06:42,176 --> 01:06:43,843
a music video here.

1761
01:06:43,843 --> 01:06:45,410
That'd be so nice.

1762
01:06:46,510 --> 01:06:47,510
If you have a camera,

1763
01:06:47,510 --> 01:06:49,543
you can film a movie or a music video there.

1764
01:06:52,310 --> 01:06:53,243
I love this song.

1765
01:06:54,410 --> 01:06:57,676
I'll be walking around lonely in the reeds here.

1766
01:06:59,143 --> 01:07:00,243
(Pant)

1767
01:07:00,243 --> 01:07:01,443
(Pant)

1768
01:07:02,243 --> 01:07:03,876
Are you filming for a video game?

1769
01:07:03,876 --> 01:07:05,243
This is somehow embarrassing.

1770
01:07:06,843 --> 01:07:08,143
Was it this song?

1771
01:07:09,043 --> 01:07:10,410
Hang on a second.

1772
01:07:10,976 --> 01:07:12,376
I won't lose to Choi Jungwon.

1773
01:07:12,376 --> 01:07:13,876
What is he doing?

1774
01:07:16,243 --> 01:07:18,043
Right now, I'm a puma.

1775
01:07:18,043 --> 01:07:19,910
- It looks cool. / - That's from the 1970s.

1776
01:07:19,910 --> 01:07:21,210
- There were lots of music videos like that. / - I apologize.

1777
01:07:22,843 --> 01:07:24,176
Why did you have to do that at such a nice place?

1778
01:07:24,176 --> 01:07:26,143
- They did it. / - The music video.

1779
01:07:26,143 --> 01:07:28,943
That's actually like a music video.

1780
01:07:28,943 --> 01:07:30,710
That's just like in karaoke rooms.

1781
01:07:36,576 --> 01:07:38,510
This was really common in the 1990s.

1782
01:07:39,510 --> 01:07:41,043
Why are you blowing your nose?

1783
01:07:43,743 --> 01:07:45,343
You two play in a cute way.

1784
01:07:45,343 --> 01:07:47,176
Doing this in Yosemite...

1785
01:07:55,310 --> 01:07:56,810
It can end up looking really cheap.

1786
01:07:58,376 --> 01:07:59,676
What on earth were you doing?

1787
01:08:04,943 --> 01:08:06,476
That is so...

1788
01:08:06,476 --> 01:08:07,843
I'm pretending there's a slope there.

1789
01:08:07,843 --> 01:08:09,876
- This is legendary. / - I'm acting there.

1790
01:08:09,876 --> 01:08:11,043
It looks like I'm really going down, right?

1791
01:08:18,010 --> 01:08:19,610
What is that?

1792
01:08:20,176 --> 01:08:21,376
What is that?

1793
01:08:22,076 --> 01:08:23,976
Who knew it'd turn out like this?

1794
01:08:24,610 --> 01:08:25,810
(El Capitan)

1795
01:08:25,810 --> 01:08:29,176
(Tunnel View)

1796
01:08:29,176 --> 01:08:30,810
There's a tunnel over there.

1797
01:08:30,810 --> 01:08:31,710
Check out the tunnel.

1798
01:08:31,710 --> 01:08:34,243
- The tunnel... / - Once you're out of the tunnel...

1799
01:08:36,576 --> 01:08:37,943
How many times in our lives do you think...

1800
01:08:37,943 --> 01:08:41,076
- Tunnel View! / - We can see something like this?

1801
01:08:41,076 --> 01:08:43,510
I don't know how many times I've said wow

1802
01:08:43,510 --> 01:08:45,610
here at Yosemite.

1803
01:08:48,276 --> 01:08:50,443
You can really feel the nature.

1804
01:08:50,443 --> 01:08:53,843
Being influenced by the grandness of this nature,

1805
01:08:53,843 --> 01:08:55,643
my body is releasing

1806
01:08:55,643 --> 01:08:57,176
lots of endorphins.

1807
01:08:57,176 --> 01:08:59,843
Look at the trees

1808
01:08:59,843 --> 01:09:00,943
in nature.

1809
01:09:00,943 --> 01:09:02,510
It's just

1810
01:09:02,510 --> 01:09:04,176
like a landscape painting.

1811
01:09:04,176 --> 01:09:05,610
Shouldn't this be hanging on a wall?

1812
01:09:05,610 --> 01:09:08,943
The rocky mountain over there...

1813
01:09:08,943 --> 01:09:09,810
Doesn't it look familiar?

1814
01:09:09,810 --> 01:09:12,043
I'm sure you can figure out what it is.

1815
01:09:12,043 --> 01:09:15,010
This is where the famous computer wallpaper

1816
01:09:15,010 --> 01:09:16,943
was photographed, you silly.

1817
01:09:16,943 --> 01:09:19,710
- Your eyes aren't sharp enough. / - It's really pretty.

1818
01:09:20,443 --> 01:09:21,376
It's this place right here.

1819
01:09:22,343 --> 01:09:23,543
It's this place right here.

1820
01:09:24,843 --> 01:09:27,443
If you look in the phone, they have this emoticon.

1821
01:09:27,443 --> 01:09:29,676
- You saw this in person. / - There's a Yosemite emoticon.

1822
01:09:29,676 --> 01:09:30,543
Really?

1823
01:09:30,543 --> 01:09:31,576
Steve Jobs

1824
01:09:31,576 --> 01:09:34,143
really liked Yosemite National Park.

1825
01:09:38,443 --> 01:09:39,876
You have to

1826
01:09:39,876 --> 01:09:41,443
take photos in this spot.

1827
01:09:44,210 --> 01:09:47,843
(Tunnel View, who takes better pictures?)

1828
01:09:50,176 --> 01:09:51,443
This is the highlight.

1829
01:09:51,443 --> 01:09:52,476
I can't wait to see this part.

1830
01:09:52,476 --> 01:09:53,443
Camping.

1831
01:09:53,443 --> 01:09:54,576
I think this is the best.

1832
01:09:54,576 --> 01:09:55,576
I want to eat this.

1833
01:09:56,210 --> 01:09:57,810
- Rib eye? / - Yes.

1834
01:09:57,810 --> 01:09:59,476
The meat here are dry-aged.

1835
01:09:59,476 --> 01:10:00,276
This one and that one.

1836
01:10:01,243 --> 01:10:02,110
It looks so fresh.

1837
01:10:02,110 --> 01:10:03,910
They only sell organic food here.

1838
01:10:03,910 --> 01:10:05,010
This could be a weapon.

1839
01:10:06,143 --> 01:10:07,110
Is that a sweet potato?

1840
01:10:11,043 --> 01:10:12,476
We bought wine from a winery and

1841
01:10:12,476 --> 01:10:14,010
bought meat before going there.

1842
01:10:14,010 --> 01:10:15,176
It was awesome.

1843
01:10:16,210 --> 01:10:19,076
Now it's time for the grand finale.

1844
01:10:19,910 --> 01:10:21,776
It's dry-aged steak.

1845
01:10:21,776 --> 01:10:24,076
- Let's put salt on it first. / - He's cooking it?

1846
01:10:24,076 --> 01:10:25,976
- Look at the size of the meat. / - It looks delicious.

1847
01:10:25,976 --> 01:10:27,510
So you're today's chef?

1848
01:10:27,510 --> 01:10:28,943
I'm Baek Jungwon.

1849
01:10:28,943 --> 01:10:29,643
Baek Jongwon?

1850
01:10:29,643 --> 01:10:30,343
Baek Jungwon.

1851
01:10:30,343 --> 01:10:31,176
Oh, Baek Jungwon.

1852
01:10:32,676 --> 01:10:33,476
I know what I should do.

1853
01:10:33,476 --> 01:10:35,710
We bought potatoes and sweet potatoes.

1854
01:10:35,710 --> 01:10:37,376
Let's cook them in a Korean way.

1855
01:10:38,010 --> 01:10:40,510
If we wrap them with foil and put them in the fire,

1856
01:10:40,510 --> 01:10:41,943
they will be ready when we finish the steak.

1857
01:10:41,943 --> 01:10:44,176
Are you sure it's a sweet potato?

1858
01:10:46,843 --> 01:10:47,943
Let's begin.

1859
01:10:47,943 --> 01:10:50,910
You know in Korea, a dry-aged steak

1860
01:10:50,910 --> 01:10:52,310
costs hundreds of dollars, right?

1861
01:10:52,310 --> 01:10:53,676
- How much was it? / - How much was it?

1862
01:10:53,676 --> 01:10:54,876
Over there it was...

1863
01:10:54,876 --> 01:10:56,743
$50? It was definitely less than $100.

1864
01:10:56,743 --> 01:10:58,343
Shouldn't we cook this too?

1865
01:10:59,310 --> 01:11:00,576
- PyeongChang Olympics. / - The vegetables...

1866
01:11:00,576 --> 01:11:02,376
You know the small cabbage?

1867
01:11:03,976 --> 01:11:05,543
- PyeongChang Olympics. / - The vegetables...

1868
01:11:05,543 --> 01:11:07,910
I'll light the flame.

1869
01:11:09,110 --> 01:11:10,010
PyeongChang Olympics.

1870
01:11:10,743 --> 01:11:12,143
Wait...

1871
01:11:12,143 --> 01:11:14,510
You have to cook it on a pan with olive oil.

1872
01:11:14,510 --> 01:11:17,110
Put Brussels sprouts on aluminum foil.

1873
01:11:17,110 --> 01:11:19,843
- Add olive oil. / - They look cute.

1874
01:11:19,843 --> 01:11:22,143
Season with salt and pepper.

1875
01:11:22,143 --> 01:11:23,810
Then cover it with the aluminum foil.

1876
01:11:25,810 --> 01:11:27,743
I've never been out of breath cooking steak before.

1877
01:11:29,743 --> 01:11:31,510
- Grilled potatoes are good, right? / - Yeah.

1878
01:11:34,443 --> 01:11:36,676
We shouldn't flip the steak too often,

1879
01:11:36,676 --> 01:11:38,376
according to Baek Jongwon.

1880
01:11:39,076 --> 01:11:41,643
(A common meat grilling scene at a camp)

1881
01:11:42,410 --> 01:11:43,810
I was in charge of the vegetables.

1882
01:11:43,810 --> 01:11:45,476
Jungwon was in charge of the steak.

1883
01:11:45,476 --> 01:11:46,610
(He places it next to the steak)

1884
01:11:47,976 --> 01:11:48,876
Jihun, look.

1885
01:11:49,510 --> 01:11:50,043
(Wow)

1886
01:11:50,043 --> 01:11:51,943
(The 38-year-old men are surprised)

1887
01:11:55,776 --> 01:11:56,843
Cook on this side then that side.

1888
01:11:56,843 --> 01:11:58,810
- Then the sides, right? / - Right.

1889
01:12:00,210 --> 01:12:02,610
You need to grill it roughly.

1890
01:12:05,243 --> 01:12:06,010
Looks so good.

1891
01:12:09,243 --> 01:12:12,276
(It looks breathtaking)

1892
01:12:12,676 --> 01:12:14,276
The sun set while we were cooking.

1893
01:12:15,210 --> 01:12:16,143
It looks cozy.

1894
01:12:16,943 --> 01:12:18,010
It looks delicious.

1895
01:12:18,010 --> 01:12:19,776
- If you go there with your partner... / - It was so good.

1896
01:12:19,776 --> 01:12:20,843
It does look delicious.

1897
01:12:20,843 --> 01:12:21,876
It's sweet.

1898
01:12:21,876 --> 01:12:23,276
It looks like it's steamed.

1899
01:12:25,776 --> 01:12:28,210
(Pink boy looks out for his friend)

1900
01:12:28,210 --> 01:12:29,543
It tastes really healthy.

1901
01:12:31,410 --> 01:12:32,376
This is so...

1902
01:12:32,376 --> 01:12:33,343
Let's cut it.

1903
01:12:33,343 --> 01:12:34,643
Very well aged.

1904
01:12:34,643 --> 01:12:36,010
This is the finest beef steak.

1905
01:12:36,010 --> 01:12:37,410
- Let's cut it. / - Let's cut it.

1906
01:12:38,310 --> 01:12:39,410
That steak was amazing.

1907
01:12:41,876 --> 01:12:44,076
- Is that a steak? / - It's...

1908
01:12:44,076 --> 01:12:45,310
This is the finest beef steak.

1909
01:12:46,410 --> 01:12:48,243
It looks really...

1910
01:12:48,243 --> 01:12:49,310
The absolute best?

1911
01:12:49,310 --> 01:12:51,976
It doesn't make sense. I've never seen such a steak.

1912
01:12:53,976 --> 01:12:54,643
It smells amazing.

1913
01:12:54,643 --> 01:12:55,876
Does it?

1914
01:12:55,876 --> 01:12:57,110
It's insane.

1915
01:12:57,110 --> 01:13:00,810
(Just looking at it makes them happy)

1916
01:13:06,810 --> 01:13:08,010
Straight to my mouth.

1917
01:13:12,376 --> 01:13:13,976
I want to show them the taste.

1918
01:13:13,976 --> 01:13:15,143
This is really good.

1919
01:13:15,143 --> 01:13:17,343
- That was his best reaction. / - It's the best.

1920
01:13:17,343 --> 01:13:18,276
That was the best.

1921
01:13:18,276 --> 01:13:19,610
- It must be really good. / - That was so good.

1922
01:13:19,610 --> 01:13:21,243
See? You can't help doing that.

1923
01:13:21,243 --> 01:13:22,043
It was really good.

1924
01:13:24,643 --> 01:13:26,343
I want to show them the taste.

1925
01:13:26,343 --> 01:13:27,310
This is really good.

1926
01:13:29,610 --> 01:13:32,010
After having this, I can't eat what I had before.

1927
01:13:32,010 --> 01:13:33,810
That's why this is served last.

1928
01:13:35,676 --> 01:13:36,510
Nice.

1929
01:13:36,910 --> 01:13:40,543
(They drink the wine they bought from Napa Valley)

1930
01:13:40,543 --> 01:13:42,876
The wine tastes even better than yesterday.

1931
01:13:42,876 --> 01:13:43,543
It does.

1932
01:13:47,310 --> 01:13:49,843
Who would have imagined...

1933
01:13:49,843 --> 01:13:51,643
- You could camp in Yosemite? / - Who would?

1934
01:13:51,643 --> 01:13:52,743
I didn't even know you could.

1935
01:13:52,743 --> 01:13:53,876
Even Steve Jobs couldn't do that because...

1936
01:13:53,876 --> 01:13:56,276
- You had a great experience. / - He's too famous.

1937
01:13:56,976 --> 01:13:59,476
Since we're in Yosemite...

1938
01:13:59,476 --> 01:14:01,043
- Let's make American dessert. / - Let's cook it.

1939
01:14:01,043 --> 01:14:01,910
Okay.

1940
01:14:03,143 --> 01:14:03,910
That looks amazing.

1941
01:14:05,776 --> 01:14:07,610
- I always wanted to try that. / -  I know.

1942
01:14:07,610 --> 01:14:08,643
You see it in movies.

1943
01:14:08,643 --> 01:14:10,376
- They cook it on a campfire. / - I know.

1944
01:14:10,376 --> 01:14:11,376
- They make s'mores. / - Yes.

1945
01:14:11,376 --> 01:14:13,710
Why are the marshmallows so big?

1946
01:14:13,710 --> 01:14:15,110
- Earlier... / - Look. Look.

1947
01:14:16,510 --> 01:14:17,476
Isn't it rice cake?

1948
01:14:19,810 --> 01:14:21,576
It looks like rice cake.

1949
01:14:21,576 --> 01:14:23,310
I have never seen this.

1950
01:14:23,976 --> 01:14:24,810
How does this happen?

1951
01:14:26,310 --> 01:14:27,810
It's all melted.

1952
01:14:27,810 --> 01:14:29,843
- Crispy outside and moist inside... / - Amazing.

1953
01:14:32,543 --> 01:14:33,776
Crunch.

1954
01:14:35,810 --> 01:14:37,410
This is the best one.

1955
01:14:37,410 --> 01:14:38,243
This is the best.

1956
01:14:38,243 --> 01:14:39,410
That looks the tastiest of all the food.

1957
01:14:39,410 --> 01:14:41,076
That's the best reaction so far.

1958
01:14:41,076 --> 01:14:42,243
This is the best food I've had here in the U.S.

1959
01:14:43,643 --> 01:14:45,010
- I know. / - I mean it.

1960
01:14:46,143 --> 01:14:47,843
I've never tasted something like this before.

1961
01:14:47,843 --> 01:14:49,576
I'm going to roast these at home now.

1962
01:14:49,576 --> 01:14:53,043
(A taste you want to take back home)

1963
01:14:57,510 --> 01:14:59,710
Should we have the ultimate experience of feeling small?

1964
01:14:59,710 --> 01:15:00,676
- Should we? / - Yeah.

1965
01:15:00,676 --> 01:15:02,476
Let's look up at the sky

1966
01:15:02,476 --> 01:15:04,110
and be immersed in the stars.

1967
01:15:12,410 --> 01:15:13,910
The stars that were hiding

1968
01:15:13,910 --> 01:15:15,410
are starting to reveal themselves.

1969
01:15:17,943 --> 01:15:20,143
Jihun, you sound like a poet.

1970
01:15:21,276 --> 01:15:22,310
I sometimes write poems.

1971
01:15:24,443 --> 01:15:28,110
Tears welling up in your eyes.

1972
01:15:39,143 --> 01:15:40,610
Can you really see that?

1973
01:15:40,610 --> 01:15:41,776
- What is that? / - What?

1974
01:15:41,776 --> 01:15:44,676
- Is that real? / - These stars were always there.

1975
01:15:46,910 --> 01:15:48,376
It's just that we couldn't see them.

1976
01:15:53,376 --> 01:15:57,610
(It's a beautiful gift from the sky)

1977
01:15:57,610 --> 01:15:59,043
I'm so envious.

1978
01:16:01,076 --> 01:16:03,643
It can't be described with words.

1979
01:16:04,643 --> 01:16:06,776
I wish the people watching this...

1980
01:16:07,876 --> 01:16:10,643
They might not feel this 100%...

1981
01:16:10,643 --> 01:16:12,110
I wish they can even feel 10%.

1982
01:16:12,110 --> 01:16:14,576
- 10%. / - Even 10% will be enough.

1983
01:16:14,576 --> 01:16:17,543
I feel really small in the face of nature.

1984
01:16:17,543 --> 01:16:18,843
This was the

1985
01:16:18,843 --> 01:16:20,976
most satisfying trip for me.

1986
01:16:20,976 --> 01:16:22,443
I told you.

1987
01:16:22,443 --> 01:16:24,010
That's why we came to Yosemite

1988
01:16:24,010 --> 01:16:25,310
on the last day of our trip.

1989
01:16:26,276 --> 01:16:28,476
San Francisco,

1990
01:16:28,476 --> 01:16:29,810
Pier 39,

1991
01:16:29,810 --> 01:16:32,010
Napa Valley Winery...

1992
01:16:32,010 --> 01:16:33,210
Anyone can go there.

1993
01:16:33,210 --> 01:16:34,776
But being here like this

1994
01:16:34,776 --> 01:16:36,410
in the grandness of nature...

1995
01:16:36,410 --> 01:16:38,410
- Having time like this... / - You're right.

1996
01:16:38,410 --> 01:16:40,176
- It's not easy to do. / - Very true.

1997
01:16:42,976 --> 01:16:44,043
Cluck Cluck Tour.

1998
01:16:44,043 --> 01:16:45,176
- Forever! / - Forever!

1999
01:16:47,876 --> 01:16:49,510
That's so amazing.

2000
01:16:55,243 --> 01:16:57,543
The winery and camping looked really good.

2001
01:16:57,543 --> 01:16:59,443
There were pouring stars.

2002
01:16:59,443 --> 01:17:01,376
If you look up at the sky,

2003
01:17:01,376 --> 01:17:03,876
you can't see stars immediately.

2004
01:17:03,876 --> 01:17:06,810
But if you wait for like 10 to 15 seconds,

2005
01:17:06,810 --> 01:17:07,610
you start to see them.

2006
01:17:07,610 --> 01:17:09,810
- Because our eyes... / - They're not used to it.

2007
01:17:09,810 --> 01:17:12,643
- Then over time... / - Like it's charging up?

2008
01:17:12,643 --> 01:17:13,310
You can't see at first.

2009
01:17:13,310 --> 01:17:14,676
I thought there were no stars at first.

2010
01:17:14,676 --> 01:17:16,476
But after 5, 10 seconds...

2011
01:17:16,476 --> 01:17:18,476
- There are so many stars. / - It's full of stars?

2012
01:17:18,476 --> 01:17:20,143
- It's full of stars. / - You're on the other team...

2013
01:17:20,143 --> 01:17:22,576
- But the camping looked really good. / - I'm jealous.

2014
01:17:22,576 --> 01:17:24,143
How did you carry up your luggage?

2015
01:17:24,143 --> 01:17:25,510
When you go camping...

2016
01:17:25,510 --> 01:17:28,776
They provide the tables and fire.

2017
01:17:28,776 --> 01:17:29,843
- They provide those things? / - Yes.

2018
01:17:29,843 --> 01:17:31,310
So you just need the food.

2019
01:17:31,310 --> 01:17:32,876
You can buy at a local grocery

2020
01:17:32,876 --> 01:17:35,043
and you can take the wine from the winery.

2021
01:17:35,910 --> 01:17:37,543
- That's good. / - Okay.

2022
01:17:37,543 --> 01:17:40,310
Cluck Cluck Tour went to Northern California.

2023
01:17:40,310 --> 01:17:42,310
It's time to find out how much the trip cost.

2024
01:17:42,310 --> 01:17:45,143
The total amount we spent for 3 days and 2 nights

2025
01:17:45,143 --> 01:17:45,876
in Northern California...

2026
01:17:45,876 --> 01:17:46,776
The total amount?

2027
01:17:46,776 --> 01:17:48,010
- Per person. / - Per person!

2028
01:17:48,010 --> 01:17:49,176
Per person?

2029
01:17:49,176 --> 01:17:52,076
$817.50.

2030
01:17:52,076 --> 01:17:53,310
Why's it so cheap?

2031
01:17:53,310 --> 01:17:54,643
- Cheap, right? / - Why is it so cheap?

2032
01:17:54,643 --> 01:17:55,310
Right?

2033
01:17:55,310 --> 01:17:57,576
Some of them are shocked.

2034
01:17:57,576 --> 01:18:00,376
- Let's vote. / - We'll stand up.

2035
01:18:00,376 --> 01:18:02,476
Let's say our final comments

2036
01:18:02,476 --> 01:18:03,843
and do the vote.

2037
01:18:03,843 --> 01:18:06,343
Rather than a fancy and fast-paced trip,

2038
01:18:06,343 --> 01:18:08,643
I prefer a slow holiday.

2039
01:18:08,643 --> 01:18:10,043
I love autumn.

2040
01:18:10,043 --> 01:18:11,910
So San Francisco...

2041
01:18:11,910 --> 01:18:13,643
If you want a slow trip

2042
01:18:13,643 --> 01:18:15,443
and you want to experience positive energy...

2043
01:18:15,443 --> 01:18:17,310
I recommend San Francisco.

2044
01:18:17,310 --> 01:18:18,110
Okay.

2045
01:18:18,110 --> 01:18:21,576
The trip that Cluck Cluck Tour planned...

2046
01:18:22,443 --> 01:18:25,276
Will you visit Northern California?

2047
01:18:25,276 --> 01:18:27,376
Yes or no? Please vote!

2048
01:18:29,476 --> 01:18:32,343
(Cluck Cluck Tour designed a trip to Northern California)

2049
01:18:32,343 --> 01:18:35,510
(What will the judges choose?)

2050
01:18:35,510 --> 01:18:39,476
We'll reveal the result together next week.

2051
01:18:39,476 --> 01:18:40,276
Next week.

2052
01:18:40,276 --> 01:18:42,843
Please look forward to the Southern California trip.

2053
01:18:42,843 --> 01:18:43,576
Please look forward to it.

2054
01:18:43,576 --> 01:18:44,576
We'll see you next week.

2055
01:18:44,576 --> 01:18:46,210
Thank you.

2056
01:18:48,710 --> 01:18:51,810
(Next week)

2057
01:18:51,810 --> 01:18:54,143
Everyone wants to visit Hollywood at least once.

2058
01:18:54,143 --> 01:18:55,476
On this trip,

2059
01:18:55,476 --> 01:18:57,576
we won't go to obvious places.

2060
01:18:57,576 --> 01:19:00,210
- Like we're the leads in a movie. / - The leads.

2061
01:19:00,210 --> 01:19:02,010
For California.

2062
01:19:03,743 --> 01:19:05,076
I'm so scared!

2063
01:19:05,810 --> 01:19:08,243
I'm the highest.

2064
01:19:08,876 --> 01:19:10,543
Let's go.

2065
01:19:10,543 --> 01:19:13,176
(Having fun, let's go with Girl's Day)

2066
01:19:13,343 --> 01:19:14,243
We're going to win.

2067
01:19:14,843 --> 01:19:16,176
We've won already.

2068
