00:00:00,274 --> 00:00:02,308
(Special Battle Trip for fall, a good time to get away) 

2
00:00:04,941 --> 00:00:07,841
(What is this place where things are busy?) 

3
00:00:13,808 --> 00:00:14,674
Welcome. 

4
00:00:15,808 --> 00:00:18,074
Welcome to Battle Trip Restaurant 

5
00:00:18,074 --> 00:00:21,274
for the gourmet trip special. 

6
00:00:22,341 --> 00:00:25,174
(Gourmet trip is also war) 

7
00:00:25,174 --> 00:00:26,174
Unbelievable. 

8
00:00:26,174 --> 00:00:28,408
- It's Venice. / - Venice! 

9
00:00:28,641 --> 00:00:30,074
Wow, it's so pretty here. 

10
00:00:30,074 --> 00:00:32,574
Sikyung is actually handsome. 

11
00:00:32,574 --> 00:00:33,541
Come over here. 

12
00:00:33,541 --> 00:00:35,474
I have to order another pasta. 

13
00:00:35,708 --> 00:00:37,108
You can't keep your hands off. 

14
00:00:37,108 --> 00:00:39,441
As soon as it touched my tongue, it was good. 

15
00:00:39,441 --> 00:00:41,608
Wow, this is the answer. 

16
00:00:42,674 --> 00:00:44,208
It just melts. 

17
00:00:44,208 --> 00:00:46,474
It is very savory and delicious. 

18
00:00:46,474 --> 00:00:48,074
Why is this so good? 

19
00:00:49,641 --> 00:00:51,374
I love this. 

20
00:00:51,708 --> 00:00:54,241
I think today's getting better. I love it. 

21
00:00:55,008 --> 00:00:58,608
We've arrived in Catalonia Square. 

22
00:00:59,108 --> 00:01:00,941
(It restores your lost appetite) 

23
00:01:00,941 --> 00:01:02,741
This is so good. 

24
00:01:03,041 --> 00:01:06,308
(Leechelin Tour, gourmet trip) 

25
00:01:08,008 --> 00:01:10,441
(Which team will win?) 

26
00:01:11,941 --> 00:01:13,541
Gourmet trip is also war. 

27
00:01:13,541 --> 00:01:15,874
Battle Trip! 

28
00:01:17,708 --> 00:01:18,741
- Alright. / - Yes. 

29
00:01:18,908 --> 00:01:20,341
Just like last week, 

30
00:01:20,341 --> 00:01:22,341
we're going to Europe for the gourmet trips. 

31
00:01:22,341 --> 00:01:24,274
It's a special battle between the hosts. 

32
00:01:24,274 --> 00:01:25,874
And we have special judges, 

33
00:01:25,874 --> 00:01:27,708
Lovelyz and PENTAGON. 

34
00:01:28,108 --> 00:01:29,474
(PENTAGON) 

35
00:01:30,141 --> 00:01:30,974
(Lovelyz) 

36
00:01:30,974 --> 00:01:31,974
You must have 

37
00:01:31,974 --> 00:01:34,674
wanted to have the dishes so much. 

38
00:01:34,941 --> 00:01:36,074
It was hard, wasn't it? 

39
00:01:36,074 --> 00:01:37,041
It was really hard. 

40
00:01:37,041 --> 00:01:38,541
What did you want to eat the most? 

41
00:01:38,541 --> 00:01:40,541
- The monkfish dish. / - Monkfish. 

42
00:01:40,541 --> 00:01:42,141
The monkfish and liver. 

43
00:01:42,641 --> 00:01:44,141
What about Lovelyz? 

44
00:01:44,141 --> 00:01:46,708
I think it was the Italian effect. 

45
00:01:46,708 --> 00:01:48,441
Everything looked so delicious. 

46
00:01:48,441 --> 00:01:50,808
So I can't wait to watch the trip to Spain. 

47
00:01:50,808 --> 00:01:52,408
Jiae says 

48
00:01:52,408 --> 00:01:54,541
she wants to go on a honeymoon to Venice. 

49
00:01:54,541 --> 00:01:56,141
- Really? / - That's right. 

50
00:01:56,141 --> 00:01:59,374
Going on a honeymoon to Venice is my dream. 

51
00:01:59,674 --> 00:02:02,374
I think you'll want to go to Barcelona first. 

52
00:02:02,374 --> 00:02:03,774
(She might go to Barcelona for the honeymoon) 

53
00:02:03,774 --> 00:02:05,274
You will stop by Barcelona on the way to Venice. 

54
00:02:05,274 --> 00:02:07,908
- I'm sure she will. / - We didn't watch your trip yet. 

55
00:02:07,908 --> 00:02:09,708
And we have this corner inside a corner, 

56
00:02:09,708 --> 00:02:11,341
Sook's Choice. 

57
00:02:11,341 --> 00:02:13,774
The liver dish, the monkfish dish 

58
00:02:13,774 --> 00:02:16,608
and pizza diavola were ranked first. 

59
00:02:16,608 --> 00:02:19,674
Our final selection was the monkfish dish. 

60
00:02:19,674 --> 00:02:20,808
- The monkfish dish. / - That looks invincible. 

61
00:02:20,808 --> 00:02:21,941
- It does. / - But... 

62
00:02:21,941 --> 00:02:23,574
- Today... / - There will be a big twist today. 

63
00:02:23,574 --> 00:02:25,974
- That's right. Today... / - There will be a big twist. 

64
00:02:25,974 --> 00:02:27,608
We are going to Barcelona, Spain. 

65
00:02:27,608 --> 00:02:29,508
- How was it? / - In fact, everyone... 

66
00:02:29,508 --> 00:02:32,541
Do you know that the human brain 

67
00:02:32,541 --> 00:02:34,474
always wants something new? 

68
00:02:34,708 --> 00:02:37,174
Italy has great pizza, that's for sure. 

69
00:02:37,174 --> 00:02:39,208
I'm sure they have great monkfish dish too. 

70
00:02:39,474 --> 00:02:41,674
But in Spain, you're going to see something different. 

71
00:02:42,074 --> 00:02:43,541
- I almost passed out from it. / - Wait. 

72
00:02:43,541 --> 00:02:46,308
- Is it different and salty? / - Is it salty? 

73
00:02:46,308 --> 00:02:47,741
Some dishes were salty, but it's... 

74
00:02:47,741 --> 00:02:49,608
- A new version. / - What I'm wondering is... 

75
00:02:49,808 --> 00:02:51,141
As you know, there's Sook's ranking. 

76
00:02:51,141 --> 00:02:52,608
Do you think this will be totally changed? 

77
00:02:52,608 --> 00:02:54,341
I don't know about the bottom of the list 

78
00:02:54,341 --> 00:02:56,608
but we have something that definitely goes to the top. 

79
00:02:56,608 --> 00:02:57,774
- To the top? / - It will be on the top of the list. 

80
00:02:57,774 --> 00:02:59,008
- On the top? / - On the top. 

81
00:02:59,008 --> 00:03:01,908
It will push the liver dish down. 

82
00:03:01,908 --> 00:03:03,674
- Will it push it down? / - And... 

83
00:03:04,141 --> 00:03:05,608
It was so affordable. 

84
00:03:05,608 --> 00:03:07,141
(They were delicious and cheap) 

85
00:03:07,141 --> 00:03:08,708
I was really surprised. 

86
00:03:08,708 --> 00:03:10,041
Venice is actually pretty expensive. 

87
00:03:10,041 --> 00:03:11,241
Venice is one of the best travel destinations. 

88
00:03:11,241 --> 00:03:14,441
- They spent $204 per person. / - It's expensive. 

89
00:03:14,441 --> 00:03:17,141
I'm going to compare the prices. 

90
00:03:17,708 --> 00:03:20,508
Wonil is really good at describing the food 

91
00:03:20,508 --> 00:03:24,208
and knows how to cook and bake a lot of things. 

92
00:03:24,208 --> 00:03:27,141
Since our theme is gourmet trip, 

93
00:03:27,141 --> 00:03:28,841
we were determined to 

94
00:03:28,841 --> 00:03:31,441
show you the delicious food. 

95
00:03:31,441 --> 00:03:32,841
Although we were in Barcelona, 

96
00:03:32,841 --> 00:03:34,141
we gave up on Gaudi, 

97
00:03:34,141 --> 00:03:36,574
Magic Fountain of Montjuic and everything. 

98
00:03:36,574 --> 00:03:39,541
We focused only on finding delicious dishes. 

99
00:03:39,541 --> 00:03:42,174
In order to introduce you to gourmet restaurants, 

100
00:03:42,174 --> 00:03:43,841
we worked very hard. 

101
00:03:44,574 --> 00:03:48,174
Alright. Today, we can see the result of the match 

102
00:03:48,174 --> 00:03:51,141
between the trip to Venice and the trip to Barcelona. 

103
00:03:51,508 --> 00:03:54,708
Before we watched their trip in Venice... 

104
00:03:54,708 --> 00:03:56,641
- We had some aperitif... / - That's true. 

105
00:03:56,641 --> 00:03:58,874
- To warm up our stomachs. / - We did. 

106
00:03:58,874 --> 00:04:00,574
Do we have something from Barcelona as well? 

107
00:04:00,574 --> 00:04:01,808
We do have something. 

108
00:04:01,808 --> 00:04:03,808
- There is something. / - Yes! 

109
00:04:03,808 --> 00:04:05,141
(An appetizer from Barcelona) 

110
00:04:05,141 --> 00:04:07,374
- Check out the menu first. / - Some drinks? 

111
00:04:07,374 --> 00:04:08,874
Check out the menu. 

112
00:04:09,674 --> 00:04:11,408
- Take a look. / - Gambas. 

113
00:04:11,408 --> 00:04:13,641
You all should know gambas. 

114
00:04:14,308 --> 00:04:16,174
Make some noise if you like shrimps! 

115
00:04:16,808 --> 00:04:18,641
"Gambas" means shrimp 

116
00:04:18,641 --> 00:04:21,508
and "al ajillo" means garlic sauce. 

117
00:04:21,508 --> 00:04:23,408
With this, you can eat so much bread. 

118
00:04:23,541 --> 00:04:25,441
- So... / - I know. It's really delicious. 

119
00:04:25,441 --> 00:04:27,841
You dip a piece of bread into the sauce... 

120
00:04:27,841 --> 00:04:30,074
- And put a shrimp on it. / - It's very delicious. 

121
00:04:30,074 --> 00:04:31,074
- It's really nice from the start. / - I feel nervous. 

122
00:04:31,074 --> 00:04:33,274
I can already see Wonil's face eating it with bread. 

123
00:04:33,708 --> 00:04:35,474
The next menu is... 

124
00:04:35,608 --> 00:04:37,408
Arroz caldoso. 

125
00:04:37,408 --> 00:04:39,141
- I've never heard of this. / - What could it be? 

126
00:04:39,141 --> 00:04:40,608
I'm so curious. 

127
00:04:40,941 --> 00:04:42,841
To put it in a nutshell... 

128
00:04:43,541 --> 00:04:45,674
It's like spicy fish stew with crayfish in it. 

129
00:04:45,674 --> 00:04:47,074
(It's like spicy fish stew with crayfish) 

130
00:04:47,074 --> 00:04:48,508
And there's rice in it. 

131
00:04:48,508 --> 00:04:50,408
- Rice? / - It has rice in it. 

132
00:04:50,708 --> 00:04:52,141
Poor crayfish. 

133
00:04:52,941 --> 00:04:55,474
There are so many dishes we don't know. 

134
00:04:55,474 --> 00:04:58,141
The next menu is sangria. 

135
00:04:58,341 --> 00:04:59,874
I love sangria. 

136
00:04:59,874 --> 00:05:01,541
I have heard of sangria. 

137
00:05:01,541 --> 00:05:03,808
Many women love this drink. 

138
00:05:03,808 --> 00:05:07,708
In Spain, good wines are drunk as they are. 

139
00:05:07,708 --> 00:05:10,474
They mix the wines that are slightly lower in quality 

140
00:05:10,474 --> 00:05:12,908
with orange juice, carbonated water, lemons, apples 

141
00:05:12,908 --> 00:05:17,008
and grapes, making it sweet. 

142
00:05:17,008 --> 00:05:20,174
So it's basically cheap wine you can't drink alone, 

143
00:05:20,174 --> 00:05:21,574
that you add flavors to. 

144
00:05:22,674 --> 00:05:24,708
It's like an aperitif. 

145
00:05:24,708 --> 00:05:26,574
- Is it an aperitif? / - Sook, ring the bell. 

146
00:05:26,574 --> 00:05:28,808
Wait. I should ring the bell? 

147
00:05:29,174 --> 00:05:30,408
Okay. 

148
00:05:30,408 --> 00:05:33,074
- Please bring the food in. / - Please come in. 

149
00:05:33,074 --> 00:05:34,574
(What is the appetizer from Barcelona?) 

150
00:05:35,241 --> 00:05:37,208
No, no. 

151
00:05:38,008 --> 00:05:40,008
What did you have last week? 

152
00:05:40,008 --> 00:05:41,241
- Was it Spritz? / - Yes. 

153
00:05:41,241 --> 00:05:43,741
- What is that? / - See how this is compared to that. 

154
00:05:43,741 --> 00:05:45,808
- Doesn't it look delicious? / - I've never had... 

155
00:05:45,808 --> 00:05:47,074
Such a heavy glass of wine. 

156
00:05:47,741 --> 00:05:50,274
- Pour yourselves some. / - This is all fruit, right? 

157
00:05:50,274 --> 00:05:51,374
Yes. 

158
00:05:51,841 --> 00:05:53,841
- This is an aperitif. / - By the way... 

159
00:05:53,841 --> 00:05:55,541
Why aren't you giving us some? 

160
00:05:56,641 --> 00:05:58,174
- Cheers. / - Cheers. 

161
00:05:58,174 --> 00:05:59,274
Cheers. 

162
00:05:59,274 --> 00:06:01,041
- To Spain. / - To Spain. 

163
00:06:01,041 --> 00:06:02,474
Barcelona. 

164
00:06:02,674 --> 00:06:05,008
- To Spain. / - To Barcelona. 

165
00:06:05,741 --> 00:06:08,241
- It smells like grape juice. / - Yes, it does. 

166
00:06:08,241 --> 00:06:10,274
- Try it. / - It's so good. 

167
00:06:10,274 --> 00:06:13,874
To be honest, I'd prefer this as an aperitif. 

168
00:06:15,141 --> 00:06:15,974
I love this. 

169
00:06:15,974 --> 00:06:17,408
Barcelona! 

170
00:06:17,408 --> 00:06:18,874
It's just grape juice, isn't it? 

171
00:06:19,074 --> 00:06:21,941
It makes me feel I'm well-treated. 

172
00:06:21,941 --> 00:06:24,141
That's right. And sangria can taste different 

173
00:06:24,141 --> 00:06:26,974
depending on the liquor and the fruits that go in it. 

174
00:06:26,974 --> 00:06:29,341
Depending on the recipe, it can taste very different. 

175
00:06:29,341 --> 00:06:31,341
So different restaurants have different sangria. 

176
00:06:31,341 --> 00:06:33,974
Then I guess I should try sangria in every restaurant. 

177
00:06:33,974 --> 00:06:35,308
- Of course. / - That's the beauty of it. 

178
00:06:35,308 --> 00:06:36,908
Now that I had sangria, 

179
00:06:36,908 --> 00:06:40,274
I can't wait to see Barcelona. Don't you? 

180
00:06:40,274 --> 00:06:41,941
What's the name of your tour? 

181
00:06:41,941 --> 00:06:44,108
Leechelin Tour. 

182
00:06:44,108 --> 00:06:46,574
Tengo hambre! 

183
00:06:53,774 --> 00:06:56,208
(The country of the sun and passion) 

184
00:06:57,108 --> 00:06:59,208
(Brilliant architecture with the Mediterranean Sea) 

185
00:06:59,208 --> 00:07:00,408
It's so beautiful. 

186
00:07:01,108 --> 00:07:02,408
The city is so beautiful. 

187
00:07:02,641 --> 00:07:05,674
(This country is full of ingredients and delicious food) 

188
00:07:05,674 --> 00:07:07,474
That looks impressive. 

189
00:07:11,108 --> 00:07:12,874
They all look so good. 

190
00:07:13,441 --> 00:07:15,974
(Spain) 

191
00:07:15,974 --> 00:07:18,041
We're going to Spain this time. 

192
00:07:18,641 --> 00:07:20,474
- To watch a soccer game? / - Yes. 

193
00:07:20,474 --> 00:07:21,708
I'm so doomed. 

194
00:07:22,241 --> 00:07:24,408
- I'm so doomed. / - But luckily... 

195
00:07:24,808 --> 00:07:26,741
There will be no soccer when we are there. 

196
00:07:27,608 --> 00:07:29,474
(Laughing) 

197
00:07:29,741 --> 00:07:31,574
Since I'm going to Spain... 

198
00:07:32,308 --> 00:07:35,174
I want to try all the food in Spain. 

199
00:07:35,474 --> 00:07:37,041
This is why I sent you an SOS. 

200
00:07:37,041 --> 00:07:40,241
Let's try as many dishes as possible in Spain. 

201
00:07:40,241 --> 00:07:42,708
This is why I sent you an SOS. 

202
00:07:42,708 --> 00:07:44,408
The SOS. But you... 

203
00:07:44,908 --> 00:07:47,174
You're specialized in Korean food. 

204
00:07:47,174 --> 00:07:48,374
(He's a chef specialized in Korean food) 

205
00:07:49,708 --> 00:07:50,774
We're doomed. 

206
00:07:51,208 --> 00:07:52,608
Most importantly, have you been to Spain? 

207
00:07:52,741 --> 00:07:54,774
Me? No. 

208
00:07:54,774 --> 00:07:57,541
(He has never been to Spain) 

209
00:07:57,541 --> 00:07:59,374
This is the worst. 

210
00:08:00,041 --> 00:08:01,541
I can't watch a soccer game 

211
00:08:01,541 --> 00:08:03,408
and my companion has never been there. 

212
00:08:03,874 --> 00:08:05,541
Actually, I prepared some things. 

213
00:08:05,908 --> 00:08:07,374
First, a map. 

214
00:08:07,774 --> 00:08:10,308
Since I'm a professional eater. 

215
00:08:10,308 --> 00:08:12,741
I made a bucket list for food. 

216
00:08:12,741 --> 00:08:13,841
(Ta-da) 

217
00:08:13,841 --> 00:08:14,841
He's so ready. 

218
00:08:14,841 --> 00:08:16,341
Why do you call yourself a professional eater? 

219
00:08:16,341 --> 00:08:18,074
Aren't you someone who feeds others? 

220
00:08:18,241 --> 00:08:21,041
True, but I have to eat a lot to know how it tastes. 

221
00:08:21,908 --> 00:08:26,974
Spain has paella and tapas. 

222
00:08:27,341 --> 00:08:28,841
- Do you like jamon? / - Jamon. 

223
00:08:29,774 --> 00:08:31,541
- Spain has a lot of seafood. / - Jamon. 

224
00:08:31,541 --> 00:08:33,574
If you like shrimp, we should try gambas al ajillo. 

225
00:08:33,574 --> 00:08:34,774
(They're going to explore different dishes in Spain) 

226
00:08:34,774 --> 00:08:37,141
It's shrimp and garlic 

227
00:08:37,141 --> 00:08:39,174
cooked in olive oil. 

228
00:08:39,174 --> 00:08:40,474
I guess I'm going to gain 5kg there. 

229
00:08:41,208 --> 00:08:43,508
Let's eat as much as we want... 

230
00:08:43,508 --> 00:08:45,108
- And drink as much as we want. / - Okay. 

231
00:08:45,108 --> 00:08:47,441
Alright. Then you take charge of the food. 

232
00:08:47,908 --> 00:08:50,074
- I'll take charge of things to see. / - Sounds perfect. 

233
00:08:50,074 --> 00:08:52,741
- Go, Leechelin Guide. / - Let's go. 

234
00:08:52,741 --> 00:08:54,808
This is going to be fun. It's my first time in Europe. 

235
00:08:55,408 --> 00:08:57,041
- It's your first time? / - Yes. 

236

(Will their gourmet trip be successful?) 

238

We've arrived in Catalonia Plaza. 

239

It's the very first elevator. 

240
00:09:08,474 --> 00:09:10,274
It's a place of inner healing. 

241
00:09:10,274 --> 00:09:12,708
La Rambla, somewhere you must walk. 

242
00:09:12,708 --> 00:09:15,008
(At Columbus Monument, you can see the whole town) 

243
00:09:15,008 --> 00:09:16,941
It's the most famous tourist spot. 

244
00:09:16,941 --> 00:09:17,974
Bunkers. 

245
00:09:17,974 --> 00:09:19,574
It's insane there. 

246
00:09:19,574 --> 00:09:20,908
It's crazy there.

(Tour guide, Lee Hwijae) 

248
00:09:23,641 --> 00:09:26,174
It's the largest market. 

249
00:09:26,174 --> 00:09:27,541
Here? 

250
00:09:27,541 --> 00:09:29,574
Yes, yes!

He truly enjoys food. 

254
00:09:36,474 --> 00:09:38,608
But you're specialized in Korean food.

260
00:10:02,108 --> 00:10:04,008
I missed this. 

261
00:10:04,008 --> 00:10:05,874
I gave up on this.

263
00:10:07,774 --> 00:10:09,008
We watched a flamenco performance. 

264
00:10:09,274 --> 00:10:10,908
The flamenco performance must have been cool. 

265
00:10:10,908 --> 00:10:13,574
I was totally immersed in it.

- We took a direct flight. / - Okay. 

275

It's sunny and then it starts raining. 

317
00:12:31,008 --> 00:12:31,941
Then sunny again. 

318

Even the bank is so pretty. 

337

Imagine how pretty it is for people to pass out. 

353
00:14:04,408 --> 00:14:05,908
That's why they need an ambulance there. 

354
00:14:07,074 --> 00:14:09,341
- When we walk along that street... / - Yeah. 

355
00:14:10,174 --> 00:14:12,208
I'll get hungry. 

356
00:14:12,474 --> 00:14:14,574
(It's deja vu from yesterday) 

357
00:14:15,541 --> 00:14:16,774
- Let's go to La Rambla. / - He looks hungry. 

358
00:14:16,774 --> 00:14:19,041
I was starving. 

359
00:14:19,041 --> 00:14:21,374
He didn't feed me at all when we got there. 

360
00:14:21,374 --> 00:14:22,808
(Leechelin Tour's map, La Rambla) 

361
00:14:23,208 --> 00:14:25,274
I shouldn't say this but this place is awesome. 

362
00:14:26,741 --> 00:14:29,541
- It's like a scene from a fairy tale. / - Right. 

363
00:14:31,841 --> 00:14:33,908
From Catalonia Square, 

364
00:14:33,908 --> 00:14:36,974
it stretches out for 1km all the way to the harbor. 

365
00:14:36,974 --> 00:14:39,341
There are a lot of tourists there. 

366
00:14:39,341 --> 00:14:41,608
But this street was chosen as the prettiest street 

367
00:14:41,608 --> 00:14:42,508
in the world. 

368
00:14:42,508 --> 00:14:44,674
You can find people from all over the world too. 

369
00:14:45,374 --> 00:14:46,608
It's really crowded. 

370
00:14:47,341 --> 00:14:48,741
It's so pretty. 

371
00:14:51,808 --> 00:14:55,141
I love these streets where motorbike, bikes or cars... 

372
00:14:55,141 --> 00:14:57,008
- Are prohibited. / - And look over there. 

373
00:14:57,008 --> 00:15:00,241
Cafes along the street put out chairs and tables. 

374
00:15:00,641 --> 00:15:01,808
Look at the terrace. 

375
00:15:01,808 --> 00:15:03,708
Even the terrace is romantic. 

376
00:15:03,941 --> 00:15:07,408
I could walk along this street all day long. 

377
00:15:07,441 --> 00:15:11,308
I can walk all day long if you feed me here and there. 

378
00:15:13,108 --> 00:15:14,574
This street is so pretty. 

379
00:15:14,574 --> 00:15:17,608
- This is picturesque. / - You're right. 

380
00:15:18,374 --> 00:15:18,908
This is amazing. 

381
00:15:19,608 --> 00:15:20,908
Look at the alley. 

382
00:15:20,908 --> 00:15:22,841
- Gosh. / - This is so interesting. 

383
00:15:22,841 --> 00:15:24,341
(Beautiful alleys on La Rambla with antique charm) 

384
00:15:24,341 --> 00:15:27,208
I wanted to see streets like this. 

385
00:15:27,341 --> 00:15:29,974
(Before enjoying the food in Spain) 

386
00:15:30,474 --> 00:15:32,108
Spain's meal system is unique. 

387
00:15:32,108 --> 00:15:33,974
They don't eat 3 meals a day. 

388
00:15:33,974 --> 00:15:36,474
They eat 5 meals a day. 

389
00:15:36,474 --> 00:15:38,908
(People in Spain have 5 meals a day) 

390
00:15:39,041 --> 00:15:41,141
(Must try food in Spain) 

391
00:15:41,141 --> 00:15:43,608
The jamon and churros are tough to beat. 

392
00:15:45,641 --> 00:15:48,041
Here's what I want to try in Spain. 

393
00:15:48,408 --> 00:15:51,208
I heard that people in Spain get rid of their hangover 

394
00:15:51,208 --> 00:15:52,774
with churros. 

395
00:15:53,241 --> 00:15:54,208
- Here's the thing. / - That's so unique. 

396
00:15:54,208 --> 00:15:55,541
Everyone, 

397
00:15:55,541 --> 00:15:57,874
Spanish churros aren't the usual churros you know of. 

398
00:15:57,874 --> 00:16:00,574
- Don't amusement park sell those? / - Not the same. 

399
00:16:00,574 --> 00:16:01,608
(Look forward to churros beyond your imagination) 

400
00:16:01,774 --> 00:16:05,074
Spain was the first country that came up with churros. 

401
00:16:05,074 --> 00:16:06,774
- Really? Churros for hangover? / - Yes. 

402
00:16:06,774 --> 00:16:09,641
They dip the churros in the hot chocolate. 

403
00:16:09,641 --> 00:16:11,874
You dip it into the chocolate sauce. 

404
00:16:11,874 --> 00:16:13,741
You become wide awake because of the sugar in it. 

405
00:16:14,774 --> 00:16:19,441
(Leechelin Tour's food map, churros) 

406
00:16:19,441 --> 00:16:20,808
- Hwijae, it's this way. / - What? 

407
00:16:20,808 --> 00:16:22,708
- This is the street. / - How pretty. 

408
00:16:22,708 --> 00:16:24,108
Here's what I researched. 

409
00:16:24,108 --> 00:16:25,941
The street names are written there. 

410
00:16:25,941 --> 00:16:28,141
This is Petritxol Street. 

411
00:16:28,508 --> 00:16:30,708
Along this alley... 

412
00:16:30,708 --> 00:16:32,208
- There is the best... / - Churros? 

413
00:16:32,208 --> 00:16:33,941
Cafe that's been running for ages. 

414
00:16:33,941 --> 00:16:37,208
Actually, this cafe used to be a milk shop previously. 

415
00:16:37,208 --> 00:16:40,574
Around 1947, it was founded again as a cafe. 

416
00:16:40,574 --> 00:16:44,908
To this day, they sell churros and hot chocolates. 

417
00:16:44,908 --> 00:16:46,974
(How do the churros with a tradition of 70 years taste?) 

418
00:16:48,274 --> 00:16:50,308
- "Churros." Here it is. / - "Churros." 

419
00:16:50,308 --> 00:16:52,541
We should get the hot chocolate to dip churros in. 

420
00:17:04,741 --> 00:17:05,774
What's that? 

421
00:17:05,774 --> 00:17:06,674
(They're stirred up) 

422
00:17:06,674 --> 00:17:08,741
Goodness, how will we beat that? 

423
00:17:11,108 --> 00:17:12,674
I'm going to eat churros tomorrow. 

424
00:17:15,174 --> 00:17:16,941
- Freshly fried ones are so good. / - Then... 

425
00:17:16,941 --> 00:17:18,474
They sprinkle sugar. 

426
00:17:18,474 --> 00:17:20,241
It'll be coated with sugar, right? 

427
00:17:20,408 --> 00:17:22,241
The sugar would melt with the hot oil and solidify. 

428
00:17:22,241 --> 00:17:23,574
That's right. It melts and congeals. 

429
00:17:24,474 --> 00:17:25,841
He's right. 

430
00:17:25,841 --> 00:17:26,841
(Hot chocolate, $3.60) 

431
00:17:31,874 --> 00:17:33,708
- This is to cure a hangover? / - Yes. 

432
00:17:34,108 --> 00:17:36,074
- Dip it? Or do I eat this plain? / - Well, I... 

433
00:17:36,074 --> 00:17:37,708
I want to eat this plain first. 

434
00:17:38,041 --> 00:17:40,008
(How does the original churro taste?) 

435
00:17:42,208 --> 00:17:44,408
It smells lighter than I expected. 

436
00:17:44,408 --> 00:17:47,041
This isn't buttery like the churros we know of. 

437
00:17:47,674 --> 00:17:50,841
You like it. You like this. Isn't it good? 

438
00:17:50,841 --> 00:17:53,908
- Of course, Hwijae would like this. / - Yes. 

439
00:17:59,941 --> 00:18:01,441
- Gosh. / - This is... 

440
00:18:02,408 --> 00:18:04,474
This isn't like the churro from the amusement park. 

441
00:18:04,474 --> 00:18:05,774
They are different. 

442
00:18:07,641 --> 00:18:09,341
(Crispy) 

443
00:18:09,408 --> 00:18:12,408
- That looks warm. / - Did you hear that? The sound! 

444
00:18:13,141 --> 00:18:14,274
My body is secreting gastric juice. 

445
00:18:14,274 --> 00:18:16,941
Hold on. Let me take out the octopus appetizer. 

446
00:18:16,941 --> 00:18:19,574
I'll take out the octopus appetizer. 

447
00:18:19,574 --> 00:18:22,308
- Can you reconsider? / - I must include the churros. 

448
00:18:23,041 --> 00:18:24,274
Let me put it on the board. 

449
00:18:25,741 --> 00:18:27,241
(Grabbing some bread) 

450
00:18:27,574 --> 00:18:28,808
Gosh, that looks good. 

451
00:18:31,808 --> 00:18:33,808
It looks delicious. 

452
00:18:34,641 --> 00:18:36,874
Even if it's fried... 

453
00:18:37,541 --> 00:18:39,208
- It has a light flavor. / - Right. 

454
00:18:39,208 --> 00:18:41,074
- It's not that sweet either. / - Yes. 

455
00:18:41,574 --> 00:18:43,474
It's slightly salty too. 

456
00:18:43,474 --> 00:18:45,408
- They must've added salt too. / - Yes, yes. 

457
00:18:45,608 --> 00:18:47,841
They put the batter into the pipe, 

458
00:18:47,841 --> 00:18:49,574
and squeeze it out to fry the churros. 

459
00:18:49,574 --> 00:18:52,308
That's why the batter has to be watery. 

460
00:18:52,308 --> 00:18:55,574
Despite its watery batter, it's crispy outside. 

461
00:18:55,574 --> 00:18:57,874
And its inside is chewy. 

462
00:18:58,074 --> 00:19:00,974
It's chewy but also moist. 

463
00:19:01,874 --> 00:19:03,174
This is so good. 

464
00:19:04,274 --> 00:19:07,141
I've made churros myself too. I know... 

465
00:19:07,674 --> 00:19:10,074
How to make delicious churros. 

466
00:19:10,074 --> 00:19:14,074
Given that, this restaurant serves great churros. 

467
00:19:14,074 --> 00:19:16,574
Look. People are flooding in. 

468
00:19:16,574 --> 00:19:17,841
(We heard it through word of mouth) 

469
00:19:18,941 --> 00:19:20,674
To make churros, 

470
00:19:20,674 --> 00:19:23,174
the batter has to be made with hot water. 

471
00:19:23,174 --> 00:19:24,008
When you use hot water, 

472
00:19:24,008 --> 00:19:26,308
the batter's portion has to be big. 

473
00:19:26,308 --> 00:19:28,708
Look how people are swarming in here. 

474
00:19:29,141 --> 00:19:31,141
This place gets packed, 

475
00:19:31,141 --> 00:19:33,841
so they keep making fresh, delicious churros. 

476
00:19:33,841 --> 00:19:37,574
They can keep serving freshly fried churros. 

477
00:19:37,574 --> 00:19:41,141
It's really hard to keep the churros crispy like this. 

478
00:19:42,474 --> 00:19:43,641
Do we have more bread? 

479
00:19:43,641 --> 00:19:44,674
(The hunger hits again) 

480
00:19:45,074 --> 00:19:46,108
It looks delicious. 

481
00:19:46,108 --> 00:19:48,308
- Goodness, it was so crowded. / - Right. 

482
00:19:48,308 --> 00:19:50,241
- People kept coming in. / - They kept coming in. 

483
00:19:50,241 --> 00:19:53,741
Yes, that's right. I see. Only the outside is crispy. 

484
00:19:53,741 --> 00:19:55,508
This is the Spanish hot chocolate. 

485
00:19:55,508 --> 00:19:57,208
We have the hot chocolate. 

486
00:19:57,308 --> 00:19:59,274
- Hot chocolate. / - Yes, that's it. 

487
00:19:59,274 --> 00:20:01,341
- See here... / - Yes, dip the churros in something. 

488
00:20:01,341 --> 00:20:04,008
It's different from the hot chocolate we drink. 

489
00:20:04,008 --> 00:20:06,641
It has this thick soup-like texture. 

490
00:20:06,641 --> 00:20:09,108
- You're right. It's not for drinking. / - Right. 

491
00:20:10,441 --> 00:20:12,808
(You know how to enjoy food) 

492
00:20:12,808 --> 00:20:14,308
There you go. You have to taste it first. 

493
00:20:14,308 --> 00:20:16,074
- Right, right. / - You have to taste it first. 

494
00:20:20,874 --> 00:20:22,774
(He becomes a fan of Spanish hot chocolate) 

495
00:20:22,774 --> 00:20:24,308
It had a lovely flavor. 

496
00:20:24,708 --> 00:20:27,174
The chocolate isn't that sweet. 

497
00:20:28,974 --> 00:20:32,608
(How do the churro and hot chocolate taste together?) 

498
00:20:34,174 --> 00:20:35,608
It's slightly bitter. 

499
00:20:36,808 --> 00:20:38,174
You didn't get enough chocolate. 

500
00:20:40,174 --> 00:20:42,074
(Huh?) 

501
00:20:42,641 --> 00:20:44,074
- The chocolate is not that sweet. / - Right. 

502
00:20:44,074 --> 00:20:45,241
It wasn't that sweet? 

503
00:20:45,241 --> 00:20:47,041
No, it wasn't that sweet. 

504
00:20:47,408 --> 00:20:48,408
(Yeah!) 

505
00:20:48,408 --> 00:20:52,541
Goodness, let me move this up. Let me move it up. 

506
00:20:52,541 --> 00:20:54,241
(Churros moved to 3rd place) 

507
00:20:54,241 --> 00:20:56,508
I love desserts like that. 

508
00:20:56,574 --> 00:20:58,908
- The chocolate is not that sweet. / - Right. 

509
00:20:58,908 --> 00:21:00,908
(The hot chocolate swirls inside their mouths) 

510
00:21:00,908 --> 00:21:02,208
This is so good. 

511
00:21:04,308 --> 00:21:08,208
- You taste a hint of coffee too. / - That's right. 

512
00:21:08,208 --> 00:21:09,908
That's why it's used to cure hangovers. 

513
00:21:11,274 --> 00:21:13,508
(An overwhelming feeling surges through him) 

514
00:21:14,241 --> 00:21:17,174
It's neither too sweet nor bitter. 

515
00:21:17,174 --> 00:21:20,574
It's neither too thick nor watery. 

516
00:21:20,574 --> 00:21:24,308
This is the perfect thickness to dip in the churros. 

517
00:21:24,974 --> 00:21:27,774
I saved this between my gums. 

518
00:21:28,941 --> 00:21:30,141
(Laughing) 

519
00:21:30,374 --> 00:21:32,208
I want to learn this recipe. 

520
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:35,541
I want to learn how to make this hot chocolate. 

521
00:21:36,174 --> 00:21:37,174
Alright. 

522
00:21:38,074 --> 00:21:41,208
- It's Leechelin Tour. / - Leechelin Guide. 

523
00:21:41,208 --> 00:21:44,608
We have to evaluate each restaurant. 

524
00:21:44,608 --> 00:21:46,708
(Guide to planning food trips) 

525
00:21:47,508 --> 00:21:49,241
(The reviews are based on four categories) 

526
00:21:49,241 --> 00:21:50,974
(And the reviewer's comments) 

527
00:21:53,941 --> 00:21:56,274
I'll put its flavor on here. 

528
00:21:56,274 --> 00:21:57,374
Hey, don't do that. 

529
00:21:57,374 --> 00:21:58,374
(Stamping the hot chocolate to remember) 

530
00:21:58,374 --> 00:22:00,008
Location-wise, 

531
00:22:00,008 --> 00:22:01,108
it couldn't be in a better neighborhood. 

532
00:22:01,108 --> 00:22:03,208
- The prices are so reasonable. / - So cheap. 

533
00:22:03,208 --> 00:22:04,374
Now that I think about it. 

534
00:22:04,908 --> 00:22:07,374
5, 5 and 4. Hwijae... 

535
00:22:07,774 --> 00:22:10,241
- You gave really good ratings. / - It was really good. 

536
00:22:10,241 --> 00:22:11,708
I really want to try it. 

537
00:22:12,274 --> 00:22:13,708
I gave a perfect score for the location. 

538
00:22:13,974 --> 00:22:14,974
- The location? / - Yes. 

539
00:22:14,974 --> 00:22:15,974
Well... 

540
00:22:15,974 --> 00:22:18,274
For older people, it could be hard for them 

541
00:22:18,274 --> 00:22:20,574
to walk over here from the square. 

542
00:22:20,908 --> 00:22:22,274
- That's why. / - I see. 

543
00:22:22,274 --> 00:22:22,874
Also... 

544
00:22:23,474 --> 00:22:24,974
The atmosphere... 

545
00:22:25,574 --> 00:22:28,174
Because there is no view. 

546
00:22:28,174 --> 00:22:30,574
- I gave 4 stars for ambience. / - Yes. 

547
00:22:30,574 --> 00:22:32,141
- But 5 stars for the rest. / - I see. 

548
00:22:32,141 --> 00:22:33,474
Good price. 

549
00:22:34,141 --> 00:22:35,741
The location is walkable. 

550
00:22:35,741 --> 00:22:37,074
The street was pretty. 

551
00:22:37,608 --> 00:22:40,108
I highly recommend it if you want a relaxed breakfast. 

552
00:22:40,108 --> 00:22:42,674
You must try churros and chocolate together. 

553
00:22:43,174 --> 00:22:45,308
We entered the restaurant as we were walking down 

554
00:22:45,308 --> 00:22:47,541
a beautiful street in the old town. 

555
00:22:47,541 --> 00:22:49,108
The Spanish breakfast was amazing. 

556
00:22:49,108 --> 00:22:50,541
- Thank you. / - Yes. 

557
00:22:50,541 --> 00:22:52,041
- Thank you. / - Thank you. 

558
00:22:52,274 --> 00:22:55,908
(Average score for churros, 4.6 stars) 

559
00:22:55,908 --> 00:22:59,274
These are the reports we wrote after eating the dishes. 

560
00:22:59,674 --> 00:23:01,474
They made a book. 

561
00:23:01,474 --> 00:23:03,774
We wrote the taste, price 

562
00:23:03,774 --> 00:23:05,841
ambience and recommended dishes. 

563
00:23:05,841 --> 00:23:07,341
- For both teams? / - Yes. 

564
00:23:07,341 --> 00:23:09,008
I put... 

565
00:23:09,174 --> 00:23:10,708
Each restaurant's 

566
00:23:10,708 --> 00:23:13,108
representative scent on the guide. 

567
00:23:13,908 --> 00:23:15,008
Yes, so... 

568
00:23:15,008 --> 00:23:16,174
(The guide satisfies all your senses) 

569
00:23:16,508 --> 00:23:18,074
You can smell the flavor. 

570
00:23:18,441 --> 00:23:19,774
Like this. 

571
00:23:20,608 --> 00:23:22,108
It smells like paper! 

572
00:23:24,908 --> 00:23:27,208
This will be uploaded on our website. 

573
00:23:27,208 --> 00:23:29,208
This will be useful information. 

574
00:23:30,041 --> 00:23:32,941
If you go past the old town... 

575
00:23:33,208 --> 00:23:34,374
There's the Mediterranean. 

576
00:23:35,074 --> 00:23:35,741
We should go see the sea. 

577
00:23:35,741 --> 00:23:37,541
- Shall we go? / - Let's go. 

578
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:39,008
- This was great. / - That was delicious. 

579
00:23:45,874 --> 00:23:47,641
The streets are all connected. 

580
00:23:47,641 --> 00:23:48,341
They're all connected. 

581
00:23:48,341 --> 00:23:50,341
From the square to the harbor is only 1km. 

582
00:23:50,341 --> 00:23:53,174
The whole street is La Rambla. 

583
00:23:55,341 --> 00:23:56,974
Barcelona is so beautiful. 

584
00:23:58,808 --> 00:24:00,141
So... 

585
00:24:00,674 --> 00:24:02,608
- I found that word. / - Found what? 

586
00:24:03,241 --> 00:24:05,341
- Tengo hambre. / - What's that? 

587
00:24:05,341 --> 00:24:07,141
- Tengo hambre. / - What's that? 

588
00:24:07,141 --> 00:24:09,074
- Tengo hambre. / - What does that mean? 

589
00:24:09,074 --> 00:24:10,074
I'm hungry. 

590
00:24:10,408 --> 00:24:12,341
(Goodness) 

591
00:24:12,574 --> 00:24:17,541
(Leechelin Tour's food map, crayfish rice) 

592
00:24:20,608 --> 00:24:25,508
(Barcelona beach is 1 of top 10 beaches in the world) 

593
00:24:30,708 --> 00:24:32,341
I'm hungry. 

594
00:24:32,841 --> 00:24:34,774
I'm hungry. 

595
00:24:34,774 --> 00:24:37,208
Don't say it too loud. I'm embarrassed. 

596
00:24:37,208 --> 00:24:39,341
I'm sorry. It's because I'm hungry. 

597
00:24:39,341 --> 00:24:40,841
It's a place where we can have 

598
00:24:40,841 --> 00:24:42,741
abundant Mediterranean seafood. 

599
00:24:44,241 --> 00:24:46,541
It's not famous among tourists. 

600
00:24:46,808 --> 00:24:49,108
- It's famous among the locals. / - I see. 

601
00:24:49,174 --> 00:24:52,108
- If you search this place... / - Are there no results? 

602
00:24:52,108 --> 00:24:54,074
If you search it in Korean, 

603
00:24:54,074 --> 00:24:55,308
you can't find any information. 

604
00:24:55,308 --> 00:24:57,008
- There's no information? / - No. 

605
00:24:57,008 --> 00:24:58,341
- It's a local restaurant. / - Yes. 

606
00:24:58,341 --> 00:25:00,408
If you're going to Barcelona... 

607
00:25:00,908 --> 00:25:02,341
You must try this place. 

608
00:25:06,574 --> 00:25:07,574
This is the place. 

609
00:25:19,541 --> 00:25:22,141
It's been running since 1921... 

610
00:25:22,141 --> 00:25:23,841
- For three generations. / - What? 

611
00:25:23,841 --> 00:25:25,408
For three generations? 

612
00:25:27,141 --> 00:25:29,108
- Seafood. / - Seafood. 

613
00:25:29,108 --> 00:25:31,474
You love shrimp, right? 

614
00:25:31,474 --> 00:25:32,741
(It suits his appetite perfectly) 

615
00:25:32,741 --> 00:25:34,174
Gambas al ajillo. 

616
00:25:35,008 --> 00:25:36,941
I love gambas so much. 

617
00:25:37,541 --> 00:25:39,608
Lovelyz is falling for Spain. 

618
00:25:39,608 --> 00:25:41,141
- Tempted by the gambas. / - Gambas. 

619
00:25:41,141 --> 00:25:43,241
I love gambas so much. 

620
00:25:43,608 --> 00:25:46,041
Seeing the atmosphere, since it's been running... 

621
00:25:46,474 --> 00:25:48,008
For three generations... 

622
00:25:48,241 --> 00:25:50,574
I'm sure the first owner was... 

623
00:25:51,208 --> 00:25:52,374
A captain. 

624
00:25:53,474 --> 00:25:54,841
I can tell by the decoration. 

625
00:25:55,608 --> 00:25:56,674
He must've sailed on a boat. 

626
00:25:56,674 --> 00:25:58,408
(Antique and meticulous decorations) 

627
00:25:58,408 --> 00:26:00,374
Each tile is carefully selected. 

628
00:26:02,041 --> 00:26:04,508
Everything has old colors. 

629
00:26:04,941 --> 00:26:06,074
It's a delicious place. 

630
00:26:06,074 --> 00:26:07,074
(They like the atmosphere already) 

631
00:26:07,074 --> 00:26:08,241
- We already know. / - Yes. 

632
00:26:08,241 --> 00:26:09,908
As soon as we walked in... 

633
00:26:09,908 --> 00:26:11,374
- We knew. / - I'm so excited. 

634
00:26:13,241 --> 00:26:16,474
(What's the first dish?) 

635
00:26:18,608 --> 00:26:19,974
- Gambas. / - Gambas. 

636
00:26:19,974 --> 00:26:22,608
This is gambas al ajillo. 

637
00:26:22,808 --> 00:26:24,108
Goodness, shrimps. 

638
00:26:24,574 --> 00:26:26,474
Look at that plump shrimp. 

639
00:26:28,141 --> 00:26:29,441
That looks so good. 

640
00:26:29,841 --> 00:26:31,608
That's gambas al ajillo. 

641
00:26:31,841 --> 00:26:33,841
Al ajillo means 

642
00:26:33,841 --> 00:26:37,008
cooking something in olive oil 

643
00:26:37,008 --> 00:26:38,408
with garlic. 

644
00:26:38,408 --> 00:26:40,174
Gambas means shrimp. 

645
00:26:43,341 --> 00:26:46,774
(Shrimp cooked in oil with garlic) 

646
00:26:46,774 --> 00:26:49,574
- Goodness. / - It looks really tender. 

647
00:26:49,574 --> 00:26:51,941
- Seriously. / - The shrimps look great. 

648
00:26:51,941 --> 00:26:53,774
It has a nice, bouncy texture 

649
00:26:53,774 --> 00:26:55,708
when you chew it. 

650
00:26:57,174 --> 00:26:58,408
That looks so good. 

651
00:26:58,408 --> 00:26:59,908
- I want to eat that. / - Seriously. 

652
00:26:59,908 --> 00:27:01,808
- Gosh. / - It looks so tender. 

653
00:27:02,208 --> 00:27:03,374
Wait. 

654
00:27:03,374 --> 00:27:05,908
Sikyung, are you eating bread? 

655
00:27:06,474 --> 00:27:08,641
(I'm sorry) 

656
00:27:09,141 --> 00:27:12,308
With a spoon, scoop some oil too. 

657
00:27:13,474 --> 00:27:17,408
(What does gambas al ajillo taste like?) 

658
00:27:17,574 --> 00:27:18,841
- It's a bit salty. / - Is it? 

659
00:27:22,641 --> 00:27:23,974
- Isn't it? / - No. 

660
00:27:23,974 --> 00:27:25,074
No? 

661
00:27:26,108 --> 00:27:30,241
(Hwijae tastes it again) 

662
00:27:30,908 --> 00:27:32,674
You gave me too much oil before. 

663
00:27:33,408 --> 00:27:35,374
- Is it fried? / - No. 

664
00:27:38,308 --> 00:27:40,474
How can the shrimp be so plump? 

665
00:27:40,474 --> 00:27:42,374
I know, right? Look at the shrimp. 

666
00:27:42,808 --> 00:27:44,708
(Super plump) 

667
00:27:45,474 --> 00:27:46,574
Because this place is by the sea... 

668
00:27:48,141 --> 00:27:49,241
The shrimp is so fresh. 

669
00:27:50,141 --> 00:27:52,374
(He glances over) 

670
00:27:56,374 --> 00:27:57,741
Why do you keep glancing over? 

671
00:27:58,208 --> 00:27:59,541
I was afraid someone would steal it. 

672
00:28:03,141 --> 00:28:05,841
(He glances over when the food is delicious) 

673
00:28:05,841 --> 00:28:07,041
I want to... 

674
00:28:08,141 --> 00:28:10,074
Have the crayfish. 

675
00:28:10,074 --> 00:28:11,741
(Hwijae wants to taste the main dish quickly) 

676
00:28:11,741 --> 00:28:14,574
- Arroz caldoso. / - Arroz caldoso. 

677
00:28:14,574 --> 00:28:16,708
- Arroz means rice. / - Arroz. 

678
00:28:16,708 --> 00:28:19,408
Caldoso means soupy. 

679
00:28:19,408 --> 00:28:21,074
It has crayfish in it. 

680
00:28:21,074 --> 00:28:24,008
Arroz caldoso con bogavante. 

681
00:28:24,308 --> 00:28:26,141
- I want crayfish now, please. / - Okay. 

682
00:28:26,841 --> 00:28:28,041
Here it is. 

683
00:28:28,041 --> 00:28:29,908
- It's coming. / - Here it is. 

684
00:28:30,774 --> 00:28:32,641
- Here it comes. / - Here it is. 

685
00:28:34,841 --> 00:28:37,641
(We've been waiting so long for this) 

686
00:28:39,374 --> 00:28:40,674
- Very good. / - Good. 

687
00:28:41,408 --> 00:28:43,808
(It's huge in size) 

688
00:28:44,441 --> 00:28:45,541
The portion size is great. 

689
00:28:47,774 --> 00:28:51,441
(Heart attack) 

690
00:28:53,108 --> 00:28:55,341
Gosh, this could be on top. 

691
00:28:56,508 --> 00:28:58,441
We'll see what it tastes like first. 

692
00:28:59,574 --> 00:29:02,674
(Arroz caldoso) 

693
00:29:04,174 --> 00:29:06,974
(He tastes the soup first) 

694
00:29:08,808 --> 00:29:09,908
Hey, what's this? 

695
00:29:11,941 --> 00:29:13,008
What is this? 

696
00:29:17,541 --> 00:29:18,574
What is this? 

697
00:29:18,808 --> 00:29:20,141
(Wonil takes a spoonful too) 

698
00:29:20,141 --> 00:29:21,174
It's a bit... 

699
00:29:21,908 --> 00:29:23,008
Did they add chili pepper paste? 

700
00:29:27,541 --> 00:29:31,108
(Arroz caldoso makes them wonder about its taste) 

701
00:29:31,108 --> 00:29:35,174
(Cooking crayfish, rice and tomato paste together) 

702
00:29:35,174 --> 00:29:39,574
(All together with assorted fish broth) 

703
00:29:42,141 --> 00:29:44,108
It gives a perfect... 

704
00:29:44,741 --> 00:29:46,374
Balance of the ocean flavor. 

705
00:29:47,041 --> 00:29:48,974
This isn't that salty, is it? 

706
00:29:48,974 --> 00:29:51,274
- It's not salty at all. / - Not at all. 

707
00:29:51,274 --> 00:29:53,641
- Actually I... / - Yes? 

708
00:29:54,141 --> 00:29:55,308
I got goose bumps. 

709
00:29:56,308 --> 00:29:58,408
This isn't the flavor I expected. It's so delicious. 

710
00:29:58,408 --> 00:30:00,374
How can the ingredients be so fresh 

711
00:30:00,374 --> 00:30:02,608
and not fishy at all? 

712
00:30:03,208 --> 00:30:04,774
How should I describe this? 

713
00:30:05,574 --> 00:30:07,208
It's a seafood soup... 

714
00:30:07,941 --> 00:30:11,308
With all the best qualities of crayfish and shrimp. 

715
00:30:11,674 --> 00:30:13,408
I can't describe it. You just need to try it. 

716
00:30:14,174 --> 00:30:15,374
It's like white spicy seafood soup. 

717
00:30:16,274 --> 00:30:18,441
It's a bit similar to white spicy seafood soup. 

718
00:30:18,774 --> 00:30:20,141
- You're right. / - Yes. 

719
00:30:20,141 --> 00:30:21,408
If you add... 

720
00:30:21,941 --> 00:30:22,941
A tiny bit of chili oil 

721
00:30:22,941 --> 00:30:25,141
to white spicy seafood soup, it'll taste like this. 

722
00:30:25,708 --> 00:30:27,541
But it's rice instead of noodles. 

723
00:30:27,741 --> 00:30:29,308
It's like white spicy seafood soup rice. 

724
00:30:30,474 --> 00:30:33,141
But the main ingredient of this dish is crayfish. 

725
00:30:33,674 --> 00:30:34,841
The two of us are 

726
00:30:34,841 --> 00:30:36,908
having this much crayfish 

727
00:30:36,908 --> 00:30:38,474
but it's only $18. 

728
00:30:38,874 --> 00:30:40,141
- $18? / - Yes. 

729
00:30:40,441 --> 00:30:42,574
- $9 each then? / - Yes. 

730
00:30:44,974 --> 00:30:46,541
$18? 

731
00:30:47,241 --> 00:30:48,841
- $18 for 2 people? / - Really? 

732
00:30:49,808 --> 00:30:51,508
It's better to go last. 

733
00:30:51,508 --> 00:30:52,208
(Sikyung is upset) 

734
00:30:52,474 --> 00:30:53,741
They get to vote once, 

735
00:30:53,741 --> 00:30:55,074
so the latter is more memorable. 

736
00:30:55,074 --> 00:30:56,708
It wouldn't matter if they voted twice. 

737
00:30:57,541 --> 00:30:59,141
Gosh, that looks so good. 

738
00:30:59,441 --> 00:31:01,708
This isn't right. They'll forget ours. 

739
00:31:01,708 --> 00:31:03,974
This is no. 1. It's definitely no. 1. 

740
00:31:03,974 --> 00:31:05,708
If you're cooking 

741
00:31:05,708 --> 00:31:08,041
the most expensive spicy seafood soup rice, 

742
00:31:08,041 --> 00:31:09,341
it'll taste like that. 

743
00:31:09,908 --> 00:31:11,741
- Do you get it? / - Let's get rid of the liver. 

744
00:31:12,308 --> 00:31:13,708
(They can't believe it) 

745
00:31:14,074 --> 00:31:15,641
Let's get rid of the liver. 

746
00:31:15,641 --> 00:31:17,174
The liver isn't going to cut it. 

747
00:31:17,174 --> 00:31:19,374
Seriously. I'll put this up there. 

748
00:31:19,741 --> 00:31:22,074
I'll put this on top. 

749
00:31:46,674 --> 00:31:47,741
It's so good. 

750
00:31:48,008 --> 00:31:49,808
Sikyung, you look nervous. 

751
00:31:50,141 --> 00:31:51,308
You look anxious. 

752
00:31:53,074 --> 00:31:54,808
You look very anxious right now. 

753
00:31:55,374 --> 00:31:57,641
(Sikyung is giving up on the match) 

754
00:31:57,641 --> 00:31:58,841
He's given up. 

755
00:32:00,308 --> 00:32:02,341
Is Yeonbok in there? 

756
00:32:02,341 --> 00:32:05,241
(Recalling Chef Lee Yeonbok) 

757
00:32:05,241 --> 00:32:07,474
How can this be so perfect for Koreans' palate? 

758
00:32:09,441 --> 00:32:11,041
(He spots something) 

759
00:32:11,041 --> 00:32:13,008
Goodness, look at this. See? I was right. 

760
00:32:13,841 --> 00:32:15,241
They're wearing hanbok here. 

761
00:32:16,108 --> 00:32:17,141
Right? 

762
00:32:17,508 --> 00:32:19,908
This is hanbok for sure, right? 

763
00:32:20,074 --> 00:32:21,774
- It's hanbok. / - It is. 

764
00:32:22,174 --> 00:32:24,274
Let's edit this clip out. 

765
00:32:24,708 --> 00:32:26,474
Let's just say we had the crayfish soup 

766
00:32:26,474 --> 00:32:27,708
and eat this again for dinner. 

767
00:32:27,708 --> 00:32:29,674
(The food must have been really good) 

768
00:32:30,174 --> 00:32:31,341
Next dish. 

769
00:32:31,341 --> 00:32:32,841
(It's time for their evaluations) 

770
00:32:33,074 --> 00:32:34,974
Viewers of Battle Trip. 

771
00:32:35,674 --> 00:32:38,574
This restaurant is just crazy. 

772
00:32:39,274 --> 00:32:41,541
They gave a perfect score. 

773
00:32:42,308 --> 00:32:44,274
Since it's tucked in an alley, 

774
00:32:44,274 --> 00:32:45,841
it's not easy to find this place. 

775
00:32:45,841 --> 00:32:47,641
- I really liked this meal. / - It was a great meal. 

776
00:32:49,741 --> 00:32:51,008
Including the last week's episode, 

777
00:32:51,008 --> 00:32:51,841
among all the evaluations, 

778
00:32:51,841 --> 00:32:53,308
4.8 is the highest score so far. 

779
00:32:53,308 --> 00:32:56,374
This place is becoming the trendiest place in Barcelona. 

780
00:32:56,374 --> 00:32:57,341
It's a popular place. 

781
00:32:57,341 --> 00:32:59,174
If we go there, I'll be fine. 

782
00:32:59,174 --> 00:33:02,041
But if you go, you might get jealous. 

783
00:33:02,774 --> 00:33:03,874
I'll get jealous? 

784
00:33:05,874 --> 00:33:07,908
- Are we leaving now? / - You can go. 

785
00:33:07,908 --> 00:33:09,408
I'll eat one more. 

786
00:33:11,974 --> 00:33:13,974
- This is so good. / - My goodness, that dish was... 

787
00:33:13,974 --> 00:33:15,241
Hwijae doesn't eat a lot. 

788
00:33:15,241 --> 00:33:17,341
If he wants more, it's really good. 

789
00:33:17,341 --> 00:33:18,874
(Leechelin Tour's map, Bunkers del Carmel) 

790
00:33:19,708 --> 00:33:22,408
- As for this place... / - Yes. 

791
00:33:22,408 --> 00:33:23,974
- It's not far from here. / - Okay. 

792
00:33:23,974 --> 00:33:25,841
We'll go by taxi. 

793
00:33:25,841 --> 00:33:27,441
- We should ride it at least once. / - Wait. 

794
00:33:27,441 --> 00:33:30,141
- Hello, how are you? / - I'm very good. 

795
00:33:31,941 --> 00:33:34,208
(When they get in, the sign changes into a number) 

796
00:33:35,041 --> 00:33:37,074
There are three different taxi fares in Barcelona. 

797
00:33:37,074 --> 00:33:39,141
Depending on the time and the day... 

798
00:33:40,108 --> 00:33:41,641
The fare varies slightly. 

799
00:33:41,641 --> 00:33:42,708
When we got in the taxi, 

800
00:33:42,708 --> 00:33:44,474
our taxi fare was in the second section. 

801
00:33:44,474 --> 00:33:47,408
The fare goes up by that unit. 

802
00:33:47,908 --> 00:33:50,841
I really like Barcelona because wherever we go... 

803
00:33:50,841 --> 00:33:52,674
- It's not that far. / - Yes. 

804
00:33:53,208 --> 00:33:54,608
I like cities like this one. 

805
00:33:58,108 --> 00:33:59,274
I think we're almost there. 

806
00:33:59,274 --> 00:34:02,541
(They arrive after traveling for 20 minutes) 

807
00:34:03,208 --> 00:34:05,241
(They walk 10 more minutes to arrive at the Bunkers) 

808
00:34:05,241 --> 00:34:06,241
When we go up there, 

809
00:34:06,241 --> 00:34:07,841
we can overlook the city from the sky. 

810
00:34:07,841 --> 00:34:11,441
These bunkers were used in an actual war. 

811
00:34:13,808 --> 00:34:17,074
- I only see couples here. / - Okay. 

812
00:34:17,074 --> 00:34:18,241
- They're all couples. / - Right. 

813
00:34:18,241 --> 00:34:20,041
(Couples) 

814
00:34:20,041 --> 00:34:22,174
- Guys... / - Now, I get what you meant. 

815
00:34:22,174 --> 00:34:23,341
- Isn't this place... / - No, no. 

816
00:34:23,341 --> 00:34:26,508
- Don't couples come here on a date? / - No, no. 

817
00:34:27,841 --> 00:34:30,508
- Look. They're all couples. / - No, no. 

818
00:34:31,174 --> 00:34:33,241
They're just four siblings. 

819
00:34:33,241 --> 00:34:34,674
- They're four siblings? / - Yes, four siblings. 

820
00:34:34,674 --> 00:34:36,208
Four siblings. 

821
00:34:36,208 --> 00:34:38,574
Guys don't come here with their guy friends. 

822
00:34:40,108 --> 00:34:44,274
(Laughing) 

823
00:34:44,508 --> 00:34:45,841
Isn't this street really pretty? 

824
00:34:47,474 --> 00:34:48,741
This is nice. 

825
00:34:50,274 --> 00:34:51,574
This place is so nice.

827
00:34:56,041 --> 00:34:57,141
Cover your eyes. 

828
00:34:58,841 --> 00:35:00,574
(Wow) 

829
00:35:01,141 --> 00:35:03,541
How nice is the view here? 

830
00:35:03,541 --> 00:35:05,008
They are so many couples here. 

831
00:35:05,174 --> 00:35:07,374
- Everyone came with their lovers! / - Let's go. 

832
00:35:07,374 --> 00:35:08,641
They're all couples. 

833
00:35:09,908 --> 00:35:11,874
- Look at that. It's so beautiful. / - It's so pretty. 

834
00:35:13,674 --> 00:35:15,574
Why do I have to come here with you? 

835
00:35:15,574 --> 00:35:17,974
- Darn it. / - This place is really popular. 

836
00:35:19,141 --> 00:35:21,741
- One... We're not there yet? / - Not yet. Don't look. 

837
00:35:22,374 --> 00:35:23,208
The view from here looks great. 

838
00:35:23,208 --> 00:35:24,941
How great is the view behind me? 

839
00:35:25,774 --> 00:35:27,508
- Alright. 1. / - 1. 

840
00:35:27,508 --> 00:35:29,474
- 2, 3. / - 2, 3. 

841

(Mesmerized) 

844
00:35:43,508 --> 00:35:45,041
It's so pretty. It's so pretty. 

845
00:35:45,474 --> 00:35:47,341
Isn't the name, Bunkers del Carmel, pretty too? 

846

(Battle Trip Part 2 will be aired soon) 

847
00:35:51,908 --> 00:35:52,761
The view from here looks great. 

848
00:35:52,761 --> 00:35:54,128
How great is the view behind me? 

849
00:35:54,928 --> 00:35:56,794
- Alright. 1. / - 1. 

850
00:35:56,794 --> 00:35:58,494
- 2, 3. / - 2, 3.

(Hot spot for the perfect view) 

853
00:36:10,061 --> 00:36:11,261
When I looked at the city from above, 

854
00:36:11,261 --> 00:36:12,994
it was like a masterpiece. 

855
00:36:12,994 --> 00:36:15,561
(Bunkers) 

856
00:36:15,561 --> 00:36:17,461
Isn't the name, Bunkers, pretty cool too? 

857
00:36:18,261 --> 00:36:19,494
It's much bigger than Palgakjeong. 

858
00:36:20,528 --> 00:36:22,194
Do people go there to see the sunset? 

859
00:36:24,094 --> 00:36:27,328
You can see the city from a 360-degree angle. 

860
00:36:27,328 --> 00:36:29,028
It's so pretty. It's so pretty. 

861
00:36:29,028 --> 00:36:30,161
Right? 

862
00:36:30,161 --> 00:36:31,528
Goodness, it's beautiful. 

863
00:36:35,894 --> 00:36:39,294
Hwijae and I stayed there for an hour and a half. 

864
00:36:39,294 --> 00:36:41,294
- Because it was so nice? / - Yes. 

865
00:36:46,494 --> 00:36:47,728
That's the cathedral. 

866
00:36:47,728 --> 00:36:49,328
(They can even see Gaudi's Sagrada Familia)

(The panoramic view of Barcelona) 

868
00:37:00,361 --> 00:37:01,961
- There's a rainbow. / - Where? 

869
00:37:01,961 --> 00:37:02,994
Over there.

By the way, 

874
00:37:17,461 --> 00:37:19,594
there's one thing these people don't know. 

875
00:37:19,594 --> 00:37:21,761
- What is it? / - I'm hungry. 

876
00:37:22,994 --> 00:37:24,928
- Hey. / - I'm hungry. 

877
00:37:24,928 --> 00:37:26,861
- Hey, you. / - People are looking at me. 

878
00:37:26,861 --> 00:37:28,928
- Sorry. Hey. / - Sorry. 

879
00:37:28,928 --> 00:37:30,794
It hasn't been even an hour since we had our meal. 

880
00:37:31,394 --> 00:37:33,028
- Must I refresh your memory? / - Okay, okay. 

881
00:37:34,161 --> 00:37:35,428
Let's have a typical Catalonia meal. 

882
00:37:35,428 --> 00:37:36,994
We're in Catalonia after all. 

883
00:37:36,994 --> 00:37:38,061
Let's stay here a bit more. 

884
00:37:38,061 --> 00:37:40,128
- I'm hungry. / - Stop it. 

885
00:37:40,761 --> 00:37:42,128
Come on. 

886
00:37:42,128 --> 00:37:44,694
You found the perfect partner for a gourmet trip. 

887
00:37:45,061 --> 00:37:46,661
A home-cooked Catalonia meal. 

888
00:37:46,661 --> 00:37:48,194
- I'm curious. / - It's a home-cooked meal. 

889
00:37:48,194 --> 00:37:49,928
I wanted to eat a regional dish 

890
00:37:49,928 --> 00:37:52,894
since we're in Barcelona. 

891
00:37:52,894 --> 00:37:54,994
So we had Catalonia home-cooked meal. 

892
00:37:54,994 --> 00:37:55,894
That sounds nice. 

893
00:37:56,794 --> 00:37:58,128
Is that the fountain show? 

894
00:37:58,128 --> 00:37:59,861
- The Magic Fountain of Montjuic. / - My gosh. 

895
00:37:59,861 --> 00:38:00,994
That looks amazing. 

896
00:38:01,494 --> 00:38:04,194
They don't do it every month. They have a schedule. 

897
00:38:04,194 --> 00:38:06,094
You have to check the schedule before you go. 

898
00:38:06,094 --> 00:38:07,861
Thank you for showing me a great place. 

899
00:38:07,861 --> 00:38:10,228
- No problem. / - The restaurant we're going is... 

900
00:38:10,228 --> 00:38:11,228
This one. 

901
00:38:12,128 --> 00:38:13,694
They serve Catalonia home-cooked meal. 

902
00:38:13,694 --> 00:38:15,961
This is what Catalonia eat... 

903
00:38:16,528 --> 00:38:18,028
- For dinner? / - Yes. 

904
00:38:19,494 --> 00:38:23,028
(Catalonia home-cooked meal) 

905
00:38:23,161 --> 00:38:24,594
Let me explain about this region. 

906
00:38:24,594 --> 00:38:25,661
From the Mediterranean Sea... 

907
00:38:25,661 --> 00:38:27,961
- It's next to the west of the sea. / - Right. 

908
00:38:27,961 --> 00:38:30,761
They have a lot of seafood from the Mediterranean. 

909
00:38:30,761 --> 00:38:33,728
And from the inland region, they get great olives. 

910
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:36,061
From the mountains, they get truffle. 

911
00:38:36,061 --> 00:38:38,228
Pork is really accessible from the inland too. 

912
00:38:38,228 --> 00:38:40,561
Barcelona comes with an abundance of ingredients. 

913
00:38:40,561 --> 00:38:42,861
The place where you can enjoy all these ingredients 

914
00:38:42,861 --> 00:38:45,228
is Catalonia region. 

915
00:38:45,228 --> 00:38:47,028
We'll have its best food tonight. 

916
00:38:47,494 --> 00:38:48,794
The best food of this region. 

917
00:38:49,494 --> 00:38:52,294
I'm hungry. 

918
00:38:52,294 --> 00:38:53,661
(He lowers his guard and gets attacked again) 

919
00:38:53,661 --> 00:38:55,161
He's driving me crazy. 

920
00:38:55,628 --> 00:38:57,228
Stop saying you're hungry. 

921
00:38:58,328 --> 00:39:00,128
- Can I order for both of us? / - Of course. 

922
00:39:00,128 --> 00:39:01,894
I'll order for both of us. 

923
00:39:02,794 --> 00:39:04,994
I heard you guys have pan con tomate. 

924
00:39:04,994 --> 00:39:06,361
Anchovy and goat cheese. 

925
00:39:06,361 --> 00:39:07,694
(He unleashes his craving like a runaway foal) 

926
00:39:08,061 --> 00:39:09,761
- Botifarra sausage? / - Yes. 

927
00:39:09,761 --> 00:39:11,961
- And sangria, please. / - Okay. 

928
00:39:11,961 --> 00:39:13,294
- Thank you very much. / - You're welcome. 

929
00:39:13,294 --> 00:39:14,161
(Let overeating benefit the world) 

930
00:39:14,961 --> 00:39:16,561
(He's a bigger glutton than I am) 

931
00:39:16,861 --> 00:39:19,028
- He looks so happy. / - That's one of my mottos. 

932
00:39:19,528 --> 00:39:22,728
- Isn't that a lot? / - Oh, and sir? 

933
00:39:22,728 --> 00:39:25,261
- Can I have jamon? / - Yes, of course. 

934
00:39:25,261 --> 00:39:26,628
- Jamon? Thank you. / - Yes, sure. 

935
00:39:26,628 --> 00:39:28,928
- You ordered more? / - Instead of a huge meal... 

936
00:39:28,928 --> 00:39:30,894
Let's just eat a lot. 

937
00:39:30,894 --> 00:39:33,661
(Don't they mean the same?) 

938
00:39:35,294 --> 00:39:36,661
- Sangria? / - Yes. 

939
00:39:36,661 --> 00:39:38,528
- Thank you very much. / - Thank you. What is this? 

940
00:39:38,528 --> 00:39:41,094
This is wine. In the wine, 

941
00:39:41,094 --> 00:39:45,928
they add sparkling water, various fruits and spices. 

942
00:39:45,928 --> 00:39:47,428
It's sweet wine. 

943
00:39:47,428 --> 00:39:50,694
It's like a beverage you drink with the food. 

944
00:39:51,861 --> 00:39:54,428
(How does it taste?) 

945
00:39:56,128 --> 00:39:59,028
- It tastes like raspberry wine. / - Right. 

946
00:39:59,461 --> 00:40:02,494
Right, it tastes like raspberry wine. It's sweet. 

947
00:40:03,294 --> 00:40:06,561
Goodness, a guy made this drink. 

948
00:40:06,894 --> 00:40:09,061
"Goodness, this doesn't taste like alcohol." 

949
00:40:09,361 --> 00:40:10,461
"It's not. Keep drinking." 

950
00:40:11,728 --> 00:40:14,061
This is so good. It'd go well with everything. 

951
00:40:15,861 --> 00:40:17,594
Thank you. 

952
00:40:17,828 --> 00:40:19,294
- Jamon? / - Yes. 

953
00:40:20,794 --> 00:40:22,061
Jamon! 

954
00:40:22,628 --> 00:40:24,961
- Is this... / - Jamon, jamon. 

955
00:40:24,961 --> 00:40:27,161
That, that! Pan con tomate. 

956
00:40:27,161 --> 00:40:28,728
- Pan con tomate. / - What's that? 

957
00:40:28,728 --> 00:40:30,394
- Watch it. Just watch. / - You should... 

958
00:40:30,394 --> 00:40:30,994
Keep watching. 

959
00:40:32,594 --> 00:40:33,928
- Amazing. / - Fresh garlic? 

960
00:40:34,661 --> 00:40:36,261
(He teaches them how to eat the dish) 

961
00:40:37,594 --> 00:40:39,828
- Is that a fresh garlic clove? / - Yes, it is. 

962
00:40:40,128 --> 00:40:42,861
Tomato. Rub it. 

963
00:40:43,661 --> 00:40:45,994
(Spread a generous amount of olive oil) 

964
00:40:45,994 --> 00:40:47,261
Salt and pepper. 

965
00:40:47,261 --> 00:40:49,028
(Add salt to liking) 

966
00:40:52,994 --> 00:40:54,628
(Crunchy) 

967
00:40:55,294 --> 00:40:57,361
(How does the pan con tomate taste?) 

968
00:40:57,694 --> 00:40:59,361
(Surprised) 

969
00:40:59,461 --> 00:41:00,794
This is funny. 

970
00:41:01,328 --> 00:41:02,328
Why is this tasty? 

971
00:41:04,428 --> 00:41:08,028
The bread becomes crispy when grilled... 

972
00:41:08,461 --> 00:41:11,928
And you rub the garlic on it as if you grate it. 

973
00:41:11,928 --> 00:41:14,128
This is a brilliant idea. 

974
00:41:14,128 --> 00:41:17,361
Now I have one more cooking skill. 

975
00:41:17,361 --> 00:41:18,461
Why is this... 

976
00:41:19,594 --> 00:41:20,594
Tasty? 

977
00:41:22,528 --> 00:41:25,428
I might look like a fool now but this is really delicious. 

978
00:41:25,861 --> 00:41:27,261
Now I get why it's so tasty. 

979
00:41:27,761 --> 00:41:29,261
The tomatoes are very fresh. 

980
00:41:30,661 --> 00:41:33,828
The tomatoes stop the garlic from being too strong. 

981
00:41:33,828 --> 00:41:35,861
You're preparing the tomatoes 

982
00:41:35,861 --> 00:41:37,061
right before you eat it. 

983
00:41:37,061 --> 00:41:39,761
You need fresh tomatoes to spread on your bread. 

984
00:41:39,761 --> 00:41:42,894
Either wise, it wouldn't taste like this. 

985
00:41:44,828 --> 00:41:48,261
With quality olive oil drizzled on top, 

986
00:41:48,261 --> 00:41:51,428
it has a nutty, sour and pungent flavor. 

987
00:41:51,428 --> 00:41:52,061
It's so delicious. 

988
00:41:52,061 --> 00:41:54,328
- I bet it's delicious. / - We won't know until we try it. 

989
00:41:54,328 --> 00:41:56,228
You're right. You have to try it to know how it tastes. 

990
00:41:56,228 --> 00:41:57,494
I want to try it. 

991
00:41:57,494 --> 00:41:59,594
- This is really delicious. / - It's really delicious. 

992
00:42:08,028 --> 00:42:09,761
(Hwijae likes it) 

993
00:42:10,628 --> 00:42:12,428
- What about the jamon? / - Jamon. 

994
00:42:12,728 --> 00:42:13,894
Should I eat it just like this? 

995
00:42:13,894 --> 00:42:17,428
You can see jamon hanging over there. That's jamon. 

996
00:42:17,428 --> 00:42:19,928
That's food. 

997
00:42:19,928 --> 00:42:21,661
It looks like a club for hitting someone. 

998
00:42:23,294 --> 00:42:26,494
It's a hind leg of a pig, 

999
00:42:26,494 --> 00:42:29,061
salted and aged. 

1000
00:42:29,061 --> 00:42:33,361
Then the salt makes the meat dry and chewy. 

1001
00:42:33,361 --> 00:42:38,394
You slice them and eat with bread or vegetables. 

1002
00:42:38,394 --> 00:42:41,228
Try a slice and if it's too salty for you, 

1003
00:42:41,228 --> 00:42:43,128
try it with a piece of bread. 

1004
00:42:43,394 --> 00:42:44,261
You can eat it like this. 

1005
00:42:47,128 --> 00:42:48,661
Is that how you eat it? 

1006
00:42:49,094 --> 00:42:51,794
It tastes like... 

1007
00:42:52,794 --> 00:42:57,628
The best extract of 10 bacon strips. 

1008
00:42:57,961 --> 00:42:58,994
I love it. 

1009
00:42:59,728 --> 00:43:03,061
(Is it to Hwijae's liking?) 

1010
00:43:03,061 --> 00:43:04,794
So, this is what jamon tastes like. 

1011
00:43:06,061 --> 00:43:08,061
- It's so good, isn't it? / - It's too salty for me. 

1012
00:43:08,061 --> 00:43:10,094
It's too salty? I can keep eating like this. 

1013
00:43:11,794 --> 00:43:14,961
It has a very nice texture like a beef jerky. 

1014
00:43:14,961 --> 00:43:16,328
Except that it's a little too salty... 

1015
00:43:17,061 --> 00:43:18,294
It's very charming. 

1016
00:43:18,828 --> 00:43:20,694
- What is this? / - These are... 

1017
00:43:21,694 --> 00:43:23,861
Grilled vegetables. 

1018
00:43:23,861 --> 00:43:26,361
One of them is served with anchovies 

1019
00:43:26,361 --> 00:43:28,761
and the other is served with goat cheese. 

1020
00:43:29,094 --> 00:43:32,828
($10.10) 

1021
00:43:34,728 --> 00:43:39,094
(What does the escalivada taste like?) 

1022
00:43:42,328 --> 00:43:43,828
This is my kind of food. 

1023
00:43:43,828 --> 00:43:45,228
I love it. 

1024
00:43:45,928 --> 00:43:47,228
- It's really delicious. / - I love this. 

1025
00:43:50,361 --> 00:43:51,194
(He puts jamon on pan con tomate) 

1026
00:43:51,194 --> 00:43:53,394
- I'll take the jamon... / - He knows how to eat. 

1027
00:43:53,394 --> 00:43:55,028
- I bet that's delicious. / - It'll be too salty. 

1028
00:43:55,028 --> 00:43:57,428
- It'll be too salty. / - The bread is thick. 

1029
00:43:57,428 --> 00:43:58,528
What is that? 

1030
00:43:58,528 --> 00:44:00,094
(He adds some escalivada on it too) 

1031
00:44:00,094 --> 00:44:02,661
I put some jamon on pan con tomate 

1032
00:44:02,661 --> 00:44:04,528
and put some escalivada on it. 

1033
00:44:05,128 --> 00:44:07,161
- I made an open sandwich. / - My gosh. 

1034
00:44:07,161 --> 00:44:08,694
(He makes everyone hungry) 

1035
00:44:08,694 --> 00:44:09,528
That looks really good. 

1036
00:44:14,728 --> 00:44:16,828
(Rubbing) 

1037
00:44:17,594 --> 00:44:19,961
(He's copying him) 

1038
00:44:20,794 --> 00:44:23,228
You don't need to add salt with the jamon. 

1039
00:44:23,228 --> 00:44:25,728
(He listens to him well when they eat) 

1040
00:44:26,528 --> 00:44:30,794
(Will Hwijae like it too?) 

1041
00:44:35,661 --> 00:44:37,761
- He likes it. / - Why do you come here with a chef? 

1042
00:44:37,761 --> 00:44:39,161
- It's awesome. / - Awesome. 

1043
00:44:39,161 --> 00:44:42,461
I love the garlic rubbed on the bread. 

1044
00:44:43,194 --> 00:44:46,361
I wonder how the rubbed garlic would taste. 

1045
00:44:46,361 --> 00:44:47,928
It's nothing special but it looks so delicious. 

1046
00:44:48,628 --> 00:44:53,094
It's very light. Salty jamon and 

1047
00:44:53,094 --> 00:44:56,628
the grilled vegetables are perfectly balanced. 

1048
00:44:56,628 --> 00:45:00,928
- That's why it's so good. / - These are like a set meal. 

1049
00:45:01,894 --> 00:45:04,428
- This is amazing. / - It is. 

1050
00:45:04,661 --> 00:45:05,928
Shall we now fill in the evaluation form? 

1051
00:45:07,494 --> 00:45:10,294
For those who don't enjoy salty food like me... 

1052
00:45:10,628 --> 00:45:14,328
You should make sandwiches like us. 

1053
00:45:15,161 --> 00:45:17,861
If you want a hearty home-cooked meal from Catalonia, 

1054
00:45:17,861 --> 00:45:19,161
highly recommended. 

1055
00:45:19,161 --> 00:45:21,094
I love pan con tomate. 

1056
00:45:24,261 --> 00:45:28,428
(Average score for Catalonia meal, 4.25 stars) 

1057
00:45:29,661 --> 00:45:32,961
(Their trip in Barcelona has just started now) 

1058
00:45:32,961 --> 00:45:35,528
- This is the place. / - It's called Europe's kitchen. 

1059
00:45:35,528 --> 00:45:37,861
- It's La Boqueria. / - You can find everything here. 

1060
00:45:37,861 --> 00:45:39,228
This place is amazing too. 

1061
00:45:39,228 --> 00:45:41,894
There's a saying, "If you can't find it in La Boqueria, 

1062
00:45:41,894 --> 00:45:44,561
you can't find it anywhere else." 

1063
00:45:44,561 --> 00:45:46,794
(They try the typical Spanish dish, tapas) 

1064
00:45:48,361 --> 00:45:51,361
(A fountain on a whole different level) 

1065
00:45:51,361 --> 00:45:53,661
In Spain, we must see a flamenco performance. 

1066
00:45:53,661 --> 00:45:57,061
(Barcelona, the city of passion) 

1067
00:45:57,494 --> 00:45:59,061
This is insane. 

1068
00:46:00,494 --> 00:46:05,428
(Leechelin Tour's map, La Boqueria) 

1069
00:46:07,228 --> 00:46:10,694
(After a long night) 

1070
00:46:11,361 --> 00:46:15,461
(Bright sunlight welcomes them) 

1071
00:46:16,661 --> 00:46:17,861
Our second day has begun. 

1072
00:46:17,861 --> 00:46:19,794
It's our second day. 

1073
00:46:19,794 --> 00:46:22,961
Why are we back in the square today? 

1074
00:46:22,961 --> 00:46:25,661
We're back here for you. 

1075
00:46:26,028 --> 00:46:28,261
- Me? / - Yes, we're going to a market. 

1076
00:46:28,261 --> 00:46:29,328
(His heart flutters) 

1077
00:46:29,328 --> 00:46:31,394
Tengo hambre! I'm sorry. 

1078
00:46:31,394 --> 00:46:32,794
You have to check out the markets abroad. 

1079
00:46:32,794 --> 00:46:34,028
Promise me you won't get too excited in there. 

1080
00:46:34,028 --> 00:46:36,194
You know what happens when you let a cat guard fish? 

1081
00:46:36,194 --> 00:46:37,061
I'm not going. 

1082
00:46:38,061 --> 00:46:39,928
Actually, cats don't like fish that much. 

1083
00:46:40,461 --> 00:46:41,528
(Flustered) 

1084
00:46:41,528 --> 00:46:43,694
Chefs love going to markets, don't they? 

1085
00:46:43,694 --> 00:46:45,294
To me, markets are like playgrounds. 

1086
00:46:45,761 --> 00:46:47,861
Don't get too excited. 

1087
00:46:47,861 --> 00:46:50,761
I won't get excited. I will go crazy. 

1088
00:46:53,194 --> 00:46:54,561
I was so happy. 

1089
00:46:54,561 --> 00:46:56,328
(Exhausted) 

1090
00:46:57,161 --> 00:46:58,528
The Spanish chef, Ferran Adria, 

1091
00:46:58,528 --> 00:47:00,894
invented molecular gastronomy. 

1092
00:47:00,894 --> 00:47:03,528
This market is famous for being his favorite market. 

1093
00:47:03,894 --> 00:47:07,128
This is where the best chef in Spain always shops. 

1094
00:47:07,128 --> 00:47:08,294
La Boqueria. 

1095
00:47:08,528 --> 00:47:09,994
(It's the biggest food market in Europe) 

1096
00:47:09,994 --> 00:47:12,261
It's called Europe's kitchen. 

1097
00:47:12,261 --> 00:47:14,728
It's the biggest food market in Europe. 

1098
00:47:14,728 --> 00:47:16,894
La Boqueria has many nicknames. 

1099
00:47:16,894 --> 00:47:20,128
Europe's shopping bag and Europe's kitchen. 

1100
00:47:20,628 --> 00:47:22,094
Europe's kitchen. 

1101
00:47:22,094 --> 00:47:24,094
(It has a variety of food ingredients) 

1102
00:47:24,094 --> 00:47:26,694
I love the nickname "Europe's kitchen." 

1103
00:47:26,694 --> 00:47:28,328
(You can eat the jamon they sell on the spot) 

1104
00:47:28,328 --> 00:47:30,394
- They sell all kinds of things. / - They really do. 

1105
00:47:30,394 --> 00:47:31,328
(They have various kinds of fruits) 

1106
00:47:31,328 --> 00:47:34,028
- It looks delicious. / - The fruits were very sweet too. 

1107
00:47:34,028 --> 00:47:36,694
Why are Spanish fruits so delicious? 

1108
00:47:36,694 --> 00:47:37,794
They're near the Mediterranean Sea. 

1109
00:47:37,794 --> 00:47:40,328
It's because of the Sun. Because it's very sunny. 

1110
00:47:40,328 --> 00:47:41,994
The Sun makes the fruits sweeter. 

1111
00:47:41,994 --> 00:47:46,428
This market is full of fruits, meat and vegetables. 

1112
00:47:46,428 --> 00:47:47,161
This is insane. 

1113
00:47:47,761 --> 00:47:49,161
It'd be rather surprising to find something 

1114
00:47:49,161 --> 00:47:49,894
they don't have here. 

1115
00:47:49,894 --> 00:47:53,361
Look at the olive oil. Spain is known for its olive oil. 

1116
00:47:53,361 --> 00:47:56,361
Spain has the perfect climate and land to grow olives. 

1117
00:47:56,561 --> 00:47:59,728
I heard you should buy olive oil in Spain. 

1118
00:47:59,728 --> 00:48:00,894
Catalonia's best? 

1119
00:48:03,094 --> 00:48:05,528
(Shiny golden olive oil) 

1120
00:48:05,528 --> 00:48:07,428
It looks fancy. 

1121
00:48:07,428 --> 00:48:08,361
It does look fancy. 

1122
00:48:08,361 --> 00:48:10,228
Of course, extra virgin. 

1123
00:48:10,394 --> 00:48:14,928
It's first pressed olive oil. 

1124
00:48:14,928 --> 00:48:17,828
The first pressed is called extra virgin olive oil. 

1125
00:48:17,828 --> 00:48:19,228
This one is, of course, extra virgin and 

1126
00:48:19,228 --> 00:48:20,828
it's from Catalonia. 

1127
00:48:20,828 --> 00:48:23,728
That's not used for cooking but for salad, right? 

1128
00:48:23,728 --> 00:48:27,528
Since its smoke point is lower than other oils, 

1129
00:48:27,528 --> 00:48:31,194
it's not suitable for deep frying where the oil is 

1130
00:48:31,194 --> 00:48:33,161
cooked for a long time at high temperature. 

1131
00:48:33,161 --> 00:48:34,661
(A bottle of olive oil, $33) 

1132
00:48:34,661 --> 00:48:37,694
- This is fun. / - Bye. 

1133
00:48:38,294 --> 00:48:41,428
Thank you, sir. What are these? 

1134
00:48:42,594 --> 00:48:43,994
They sell fruit cups too. 

1135
00:48:43,994 --> 00:48:45,261
- What? / - Fruit cups. 

1136
00:48:47,661 --> 00:48:50,628
I have a strong drive for food when I travel. 

1137
00:48:50,961 --> 00:48:53,994
When I find something that I want to try, 

1138
00:48:53,994 --> 00:48:56,628
I have to go into the store right away 

1139
00:48:56,628 --> 00:48:57,928
and try it. 

1140
00:48:59,894 --> 00:49:02,228
It must have been very tough for Hwijae. 

1141
00:49:02,428 --> 00:49:04,128
That's not true. I was very happy. 

1142
00:49:04,928 --> 00:49:06,628
- They have fruit cups. / - What? 

1143
00:49:06,628 --> 00:49:07,628
Fruit cups. 

1144
00:49:09,561 --> 00:49:11,728
Do they have fresh fruits here? 

1145
00:49:11,728 --> 00:49:13,894
Spain and Korea are at the same latitude 

1146
00:49:13,894 --> 00:49:16,661
but the Mediterranean Sea makes it very sunny here. 

1147
00:49:16,961 --> 00:49:18,461
Which makes the fruits here very sweet. 

1148
00:49:18,461 --> 00:49:20,094
- Look at the watermelons. / - They look so sweet. 

1149
00:49:20,094 --> 00:49:22,561
There are more than just watermelons. Come here. 

1150
00:49:23,128 --> 00:49:24,461
Look at the fruit cups. 

1151
00:49:25,661 --> 00:49:28,994
Let's try some fruit. 

1152
00:49:28,994 --> 00:49:29,728
- Of course. / - It's cheap. 

1153
00:49:30,428 --> 00:49:31,994
I'm going to try the one with mixed fruits. 

1154
00:49:31,994 --> 00:49:33,361
I'm a huge fan of watermelon. 

1155
00:49:33,361 --> 00:49:35,028
A fruit cup is only $2? 

1156
00:49:35,028 --> 00:49:36,394
(He tastes the watermelon first) 

1157
00:49:36,394 --> 00:49:38,594
- Hwijae's loving it. / - It was his kind of food. 

1158
00:49:38,594 --> 00:49:39,861
- The watermelon is delicious. / - Is it good? 

1159
00:49:40,194 --> 00:49:43,461
(He takes one more bite) 

1160
00:49:43,994 --> 00:49:45,361
(He smells it first) 

1161
00:49:45,361 --> 00:49:47,428
It smells so sweet. 

1162
00:49:47,428 --> 00:49:48,494
(Spanish watermelon smells different too) 

1163
00:49:48,494 --> 00:49:49,628
In one bite. 

1164
00:49:52,428 --> 00:49:53,994
You should eat watermelon in one big bite. 

1165
00:49:53,994 --> 00:49:55,894
Does it taste different from Korean watermelons? 

1166
00:49:56,528 --> 00:49:57,628
Is it different? 

1167
00:49:58,128 --> 00:50:00,561
Because it's near Mediterranean Sea. 

1168
00:50:01,928 --> 00:50:02,861
It's really sweet. 

1169
00:50:03,394 --> 00:50:04,594
Very, very. 

1170
00:50:04,594 --> 00:50:07,194
Sweet dragon fruits are really good. 

1171
00:50:07,761 --> 00:50:09,361
- But they're not sweet in Korea. / - I know. 

1172
00:50:09,361 --> 00:50:10,761
When I tried fruits in Spain, 

1173
00:50:10,761 --> 00:50:12,561
I thought they had put sugar on it. 

1174
00:50:12,561 --> 00:50:13,728
(Surprised) 

1175
00:50:13,728 --> 00:50:14,628
It's so sweet. 

1176
00:50:15,928 --> 00:50:17,161
Did they put syrup on it? 

1177
00:50:17,161 --> 00:50:18,061
(It was a right decision to get the fruits) 

1178
00:50:18,061 --> 00:50:20,094
The papaya just gave me the chills. 

1179
00:50:20,294 --> 00:50:21,661
Should we get some more? 

1180
00:50:21,661 --> 00:50:25,728
We should save our stomachs. 

1181
00:50:26,528 --> 00:50:27,994
I'm hungry. 

1182
00:50:30,528 --> 00:50:31,794
It's so delicious. 

1183
00:50:31,794 --> 00:50:33,961
You left the camera to me and you keep eating. 

1184
00:50:34,194 --> 00:50:36,361
If I don't eat enough food... 

1185
00:50:36,361 --> 00:50:37,561
(Making excuses) 

1186
00:50:38,394 --> 00:50:39,194
I can't speak. 

1187
00:50:39,961 --> 00:50:41,994
What are you talking about? 

1188
00:50:41,994 --> 00:50:43,261
I'm done. 

1189
00:50:43,261 --> 00:50:45,561
(Wonil finished the fruit cup in a second) 

1190
00:50:46,628 --> 00:50:52,728
(Lots of fresh foods and things to see at La Boqueria) 

1191
00:50:53,761 --> 00:50:55,361
(Amazed) 

1192
00:50:55,361 --> 00:50:57,661
These are all chorizos. 

1193
00:50:58,594 --> 00:50:59,661
Spanish sausage. 

1194
00:50:59,661 --> 00:51:00,794
- People eat this? / - Yes. 

1195
00:51:01,194 --> 00:51:03,461
This is sliced jamon. 

1196
00:51:03,461 --> 00:51:05,328
This one is jamon iberico. 

1197
00:51:05,328 --> 00:51:06,728
It's the best one. 

1198
00:51:06,728 --> 00:51:08,194
And this is jamon serrano. 

1199
00:51:08,194 --> 00:51:09,961
- It's the pork we usually eat. / - That's just beef jerky. 

1200
00:51:09,961 --> 00:51:12,194
It's from white pigs. 

1201
00:51:12,194 --> 00:51:14,461
The tastes and grades are different. 

1202
00:51:14,561 --> 00:51:16,561
This one is a lot more savory. 

1203
00:51:16,561 --> 00:51:18,728
And this is what we usually use. 

1204
00:51:18,728 --> 00:51:20,961
It's relatively cheaper. 

1205
00:51:20,961 --> 00:51:24,561
Jamon is made of pork hind legs. 

1206
00:51:24,561 --> 00:51:27,661
Iberico pigs eat acorns, 

1207
00:51:27,661 --> 00:51:30,494
so its fat tastes savory. 

1208
00:51:30,494 --> 00:51:32,794
- In Jeju-do... / - Black pork? 

1209
00:51:32,794 --> 00:51:35,094
Black pork is very famous. 

1210
00:51:35,094 --> 00:51:37,694
And iberico pork is famous in Spain. 

1211
00:51:37,694 --> 00:51:41,028
So jamon iberico is of high quality 

1212
00:51:41,028 --> 00:51:42,261
and it has a deep flavor. 

1213
00:51:42,261 --> 00:51:44,228
How many times will they reuse that footage? 

1214
00:51:44,228 --> 00:51:47,394
- Sikyung is so sensitive. / - He's like an adolescent girl. 

1215
00:51:48,028 --> 00:51:49,794
He's trying to find fault with them. 

1216
00:51:49,794 --> 00:51:51,894
I had the sandwich, so I feel better now though. 

1217
00:51:52,494 --> 00:51:53,461
- He's being so sensitive now. / - Right. 

1218
00:51:53,461 --> 00:51:54,728
This place 

1219
00:51:54,728 --> 00:51:56,861
and the jamon store over there. 

1220
00:51:56,861 --> 00:51:58,094
These two stores are... 

1221
00:51:58,361 --> 00:52:00,894
The best brand of jamon in this market. 

1222
00:52:00,894 --> 00:52:02,894
- They are the original. / - Kind of. 

1223
00:52:02,894 --> 00:52:05,394
It's kind of like a battle of pride. 

1224
00:52:05,394 --> 00:52:06,561
- He's slicing it. / - He says... 

1225
00:52:07,061 --> 00:52:09,228
This is the best one, so he's slicing it now. 

1226
00:52:09,228 --> 00:52:10,761
It's not so expensive there, right? 

1227
00:52:10,761 --> 00:52:15,094
- It's about $30 for 100g. / - Not cheap. 

1228
00:52:15,094 --> 00:52:16,728
- It's expensive. / - It's salted. 

1229
00:52:16,728 --> 00:52:19,528
As it gets dehydrated, it concentrates in flavor. 

1230
00:52:20,694 --> 00:52:25,294
(They take a bite of it each) 

1231
00:52:27,194 --> 00:52:30,394
(Satisfied) 

1232
00:52:30,394 --> 00:52:31,894
For me, it's too salty. 

1233
00:52:32,361 --> 00:52:33,994
- It's salty. / - As you can see... 

1234
00:52:34,361 --> 00:52:36,028
There are always bakeries 

1235
00:52:36,028 --> 00:52:38,294
around jamon stores. 

1236
00:52:38,894 --> 00:52:39,894
- So people can eat them together? / - Yes. 

1237
00:52:39,894 --> 00:52:42,861
People buy bread and jamon here 

1238
00:52:42,861 --> 00:52:44,594
and eat them together. 

1239
00:52:44,594 --> 00:52:48,594
What you tried last week was also jamon iberico. 

1240
00:52:48,594 --> 00:52:51,561
It's like Korean beef with the premium grade. 

1241
00:52:51,561 --> 00:52:53,561
It's the top-grade jamon. 

1242
00:52:53,561 --> 00:52:55,328
I don't see a difference between this and 

1243
00:52:55,328 --> 00:52:56,428
the one we had yesterday. 

1244
00:52:56,428 --> 00:52:57,328
- Really? / - Is there a difference? 

1245
00:52:57,328 --> 00:52:58,894
I like this one a lot better. 

1246
00:52:58,894 --> 00:53:01,261
The one we had yesterday wasn't aged enough. 

1247
00:53:01,261 --> 00:53:03,528
So it had a sharp salty taste. 

1248
00:53:03,528 --> 00:53:05,228
- And this one is mild. / - The color is different. 

1249
00:53:06,028 --> 00:53:07,661
It ate a lot of acorns. 

1250
00:53:07,661 --> 00:53:08,461
It has a lot more fat. 

1251
00:53:08,461 --> 00:53:10,794
Let's try other jamon stores. 

1252
00:53:11,128 --> 00:53:12,328
We're going to jamon stores again? 

1253
00:53:12,328 --> 00:53:14,294
Of course. 

1254
00:53:14,294 --> 00:53:15,161
(He wants to compare the tastes of different jamon) 

1255
00:53:15,994 --> 00:53:17,228
To compare the tastes? 

1256
00:53:17,228 --> 00:53:19,028
We should buy a better one. 

1257
00:53:19,628 --> 00:53:22,328
We should try many different places. 

1258
00:53:22,328 --> 00:53:24,228
There are more than 10 jamon stores there. 

1259
00:53:24,228 --> 00:53:26,861
Then you can find the jamon that suits your taste. 

1260
00:53:27,128 --> 00:53:27,894
Everyone... 

1261
00:53:28,594 --> 00:53:29,728
There are people like me. 

1262
00:53:29,728 --> 00:53:32,394
Those who don't like salty food like me. 

1263
00:53:32,394 --> 00:53:35,394
- This one is good. This is better. / - You can tell. 

1264
00:53:35,394 --> 00:53:36,728
- He changed his mind. / - This jamon is much better. 

1265
00:53:37,228 --> 00:53:38,028
It's very savory. 

1266
00:53:38,028 --> 00:53:40,028
We went to another place... 

1267
00:53:40,294 --> 00:53:42,461
And their jamon tasted completely different. 

1268
00:53:42,461 --> 00:53:44,861
That's why we tried jamon of many different places. 

1269
00:53:46,328 --> 00:53:48,494
It's like a jamon tour. 

1270
00:53:48,494 --> 00:53:50,628
The savory flavor from the fat. 

1271
00:53:51,261 --> 00:53:52,361
This is a bit better. 

1272
00:53:52,361 --> 00:53:53,394
I know. 

1273
00:53:53,394 --> 00:53:56,928
(He's getting into the world of food) 

1274
00:53:56,928 --> 00:53:58,028
I told you. 

1275
00:53:58,028 --> 00:54:00,528
You come to enjoy it. 

1276
00:54:00,961 --> 00:54:02,261
(He takes a big bite of it) 

1277
00:54:02,261 --> 00:54:03,894
Can we eat this while walking around? 

1278
00:54:05,661 --> 00:54:09,128
I can feel that the savory taste of acorn 

1279
00:54:09,128 --> 00:54:10,994
permeated into the fat. 

1280
00:54:10,994 --> 00:54:13,361
So we tried a lot of 

1281
00:54:13,361 --> 00:54:15,428
good ingredients in the market. 

1282
00:54:15,894 --> 00:54:16,794
And now, 

1283
00:54:16,794 --> 00:54:19,928
I want to try some dishes in the market for breakfast. 

1284
00:54:19,928 --> 00:54:20,994
We've been eating though. 

1285
00:54:20,994 --> 00:54:22,461
It's just an appetizer. 

1286
00:54:23,961 --> 00:54:26,161
(Exhausted) 

1287
00:54:28,394 --> 00:54:30,161
They have fresh seafood 

1288
00:54:30,161 --> 00:54:32,394
in the market. 

1289
00:54:32,394 --> 00:54:34,761
With good quality olive oil, 

1290
00:54:34,761 --> 00:54:36,561
they fry the seafood here. 

1291
00:54:36,561 --> 00:54:39,461
- Let's try different small dishes here. / - Okay. 

1292
00:54:39,461 --> 00:54:40,628
(Today's breakfast menu) 

1293
00:54:40,628 --> 00:54:42,728
This is a restaurant in the market. 

1294
00:54:43,028 --> 00:54:44,094
And it's good? 

1295
00:54:44,094 --> 00:54:46,428
But they're more expensive than fancy restaurants. 

1296
00:54:47,028 --> 00:54:48,428
Why do you think it is? 

1297
00:54:48,428 --> 00:54:49,594
- Because it's good? / - Because it's delicious. 

1298
00:54:50,128 --> 00:54:51,361
- It's so delicious. / - It's so delicious. 

1299
00:54:52,661 --> 00:54:53,594
Are you serious? 

1300
00:54:53,961 --> 00:54:58,094
I believe it when Hwijae says it's delicious. 

1301
00:54:58,094 --> 00:54:59,761
This one was my favorite. 

1302
00:54:59,761 --> 00:55:00,628
The cuttlefish. 

1303
00:55:00,994 --> 00:55:02,528
It was the best for me. 

1304
00:55:02,528 --> 00:55:04,061
(Cuttlefish, $18.20) 

1305
00:55:04,061 --> 00:55:05,894
It was so... 

1306
00:55:05,894 --> 00:55:08,794
(What does it taste like?) 

1307
00:55:08,794 --> 00:55:09,894
Hey, come on now. 

1308
00:55:10,861 --> 00:55:12,361
(Smiling) 

1309
00:55:12,361 --> 00:55:14,528
I'm slicing it and the juices keep dripping. 

1310
00:55:17,228 --> 00:55:18,094
It's really good. 

1311
00:55:20,094 --> 00:55:21,261
The ingredient is crazy. 

1312
00:55:22,561 --> 00:55:24,094
Is it grilled in olive oil? 

1313
00:55:25,094 --> 00:55:27,228
- Just a little. / - The cuttlefish looks great. 

1314
00:55:28,661 --> 00:55:30,094
Please don't do this to me. 

1315
00:55:30,428 --> 00:55:32,694
You can't spoil my palate like this. 

1316
00:55:33,694 --> 00:55:37,028
It has the flavor of delicious sea. 

1317
00:55:37,028 --> 00:55:38,961
And the texture is like a rubber ball. 

1318
00:55:38,961 --> 00:55:40,428
- Right. A rubber ball. / - It's so firm. 

1319
00:55:40,894 --> 00:55:43,961
And it's even juicy. 

1320
00:55:43,961 --> 00:55:45,528
(Even the juice of cuttlefish is perfect) 

1321
00:55:45,528 --> 00:55:47,061
I told you. It's better to go second. 

1322
00:55:47,261 --> 00:55:48,828
They already forgot about the monkfish. 

1323
00:55:48,828 --> 00:55:51,128
- My gosh, cuttlefish. / - I still remember that. 

1324
00:55:52,628 --> 00:55:53,794
It must be delicious. 

1325
00:55:54,028 --> 00:55:56,794
The spaghetti alle vongole is going down. 

1326
00:55:56,794 --> 00:55:59,028
It's going down. 

1327
00:55:59,494 --> 00:56:01,328
- She just got rid of the caprese salad. / - Put it here. 

1328
00:56:02,061 --> 00:56:03,228
This is razor clams. 

1329
00:56:04,428 --> 00:56:05,928
It's razor clams. 

1330
00:56:05,928 --> 00:56:06,861
- Razor clams. / - What? 

1331
00:56:06,861 --> 00:56:08,694
Gosh, it's razor clams. 

1332
00:56:08,894 --> 00:56:10,728
- They are clams. / - Looks so good. 

1333
00:56:11,694 --> 00:56:12,728
Sweet razor clams. 

1334
00:56:13,028 --> 00:56:13,961
It's so big. 

1335
00:56:14,161 --> 00:56:16,194
- The razor clam is... / - He eats so well. 

1336
00:56:16,194 --> 00:56:16,728
(He takes a big bite looking happy) 

1337
00:56:19,528 --> 00:56:21,961
(Agreed) 

1338
00:56:22,928 --> 00:56:25,028
(Isn't it amazing?) 

1339
00:56:26,928 --> 00:56:28,328
My favorite is the cuttlefish. 

1340
00:56:28,828 --> 00:56:29,828
- Really? / - Yes. 

1341
00:56:30,161 --> 00:56:32,194
It's so soft and firm. 

1342
00:56:32,194 --> 00:56:33,628
Nothing can beat it. 

1343
00:56:34,861 --> 00:56:36,228
My favorite is razor clams. 

1344
00:56:36,661 --> 00:56:39,328
- It looks delicious. / - You know how to enjoy it. 

1345
00:56:39,328 --> 00:56:40,294
I will leave its taste... 

1346
00:56:40,294 --> 00:56:42,028
- To your imagination. / - He eats it so deliciously. 

1347
00:56:43,261 --> 00:56:45,228
The razor clams are... 

1348
00:56:45,661 --> 00:56:47,261
So chewy. 

1349
00:56:47,994 --> 00:56:51,528
It's famous for its sweet flavor. 

1350
00:56:51,861 --> 00:56:54,194
It tastes like olive oil with sugar. 

1351
00:56:54,728 --> 00:56:56,928
Those who like the taste of clams will love this. 

1352
00:56:57,261 --> 00:57:00,028
Are you saying this is your favorite? 

1353
00:57:00,028 --> 00:57:01,161
The razor clams are my favorite. 

1354
00:57:02,361 --> 00:57:03,261
We have different tastes. 

1355
00:57:04,294 --> 00:57:05,161
He eats so well. 

1356
00:57:06,161 --> 00:57:07,928
I recommend cuttlefish. 

1357
00:57:08,494 --> 00:57:09,528
It's the best of all. 

1358
00:57:09,928 --> 00:57:12,461
Fresh seafood in the lively market is 

1359
00:57:12,461 --> 00:57:14,794
the best dish. 

1360
00:57:15,461 --> 00:57:17,094
(Average score for seafood dishes, 4 stars) 

1361
00:57:17,094 --> 00:57:19,361
I want to change cuttlefish to razor clams. 

1362
00:57:19,361 --> 00:57:20,861
His hand was like this when he ate it. 

1363
00:57:20,861 --> 00:57:22,761
Razor clams look more delicious. 

1364
00:57:23,128 --> 00:57:26,394
(Leechelin Tour's map, flamenco) 

1365
00:57:26,394 --> 00:57:27,561
Is it a performance? 

1366
00:57:29,094 --> 00:57:31,261
And there is the flamenco. 

1367
00:57:31,261 --> 00:57:32,528
(Spain is famous for the dance of passion, flamenco) 

1368
00:57:32,794 --> 00:57:34,261
- Flamenco of passion. / - Flamenco. 

1369
00:57:34,261 --> 00:57:36,461
I like flamenco. But if they watch flamenco dancing, 

1370
00:57:36,461 --> 00:57:38,194
they will feel tired and eat even more. 

1371
00:57:38,494 --> 00:57:40,928
After watching the performance... 

1372
00:57:40,928 --> 00:57:42,028
They will eat even more. 

1373
00:57:45,094 --> 00:57:46,594
(There's a long queue at the entrance) 

1374
00:57:46,594 --> 00:57:48,661
Before we have dinner... 

1375
00:57:49,128 --> 00:57:51,294
We have to watch the flamenco. 

1376
00:57:52,061 --> 00:57:53,094
It has a long history. 

1377
00:57:53,361 --> 00:57:54,328
In the 15th century, 

1378
00:57:54,328 --> 00:57:57,161
in the southern Spain region called Andalusia, 

1379
00:57:57,161 --> 00:57:58,661
gypsies started the dance. 

1380
00:57:58,661 --> 00:58:00,794
What's important is that they don't have choreography. 

1381
00:58:00,794 --> 00:58:03,894
It's an impromptu performance with dance, claps, 

1382
00:58:03,894 --> 00:58:04,928
and the guitar. 

1383
00:58:05,394 --> 00:58:08,194
The moves have deep emotions. 

1384
00:58:08,194 --> 00:58:11,194
So it is exciting but it feels plaintive at the same time. 

1385
00:58:11,628 --> 00:58:13,094
- Hello. / - Hello. 

1386
00:58:13,094 --> 00:58:15,661
(They get into the building feeling excited) 

1387
00:58:15,661 --> 00:58:17,494
- Thank you. / - Thank you. 

1388
00:58:24,161 --> 00:58:27,261
- Even the building looks beautiful. / - It's so cool. 

1389
00:58:27,261 --> 00:58:28,528
I was mesmerized. 

1390
00:58:28,528 --> 00:58:30,028
- I see. / - The guitar was amazing. 

1391
00:58:30,194 --> 00:58:32,661
There aren't many places 

1392
00:58:32,661 --> 00:58:35,694
for indoor flamenco performances. 

1393
00:58:36,294 --> 00:58:37,628
That's why there are a lot of people. 

1394
00:58:37,828 --> 00:58:40,828
This place is like a cave, a dome. 

1395
00:58:40,828 --> 00:58:41,728
Is it traditional? 

1396
00:58:41,728 --> 00:58:43,428
It was originally by gypsies. 

1397
00:58:43,428 --> 00:58:44,794
They mostly danced outdoors. 

1398
00:58:45,828 --> 00:58:48,161
So this place is very special. 

1399
00:58:48,161 --> 00:58:51,428
(You can enjoy the flamenco with drinks and food) 

1400
00:58:51,428 --> 00:58:52,561
What's that drink? 

1401
00:58:53,228 --> 00:58:55,628
- It's sangria. / - It's included in the entrance fee. 

1402
00:58:56,561 --> 00:58:59,428
(Unfamiliar but interesting) 

1403
00:58:59,428 --> 00:59:00,594
The door is closed. 

1404
00:59:01,061 --> 00:59:02,128
It's beginning. 

1405
00:59:03,528 --> 00:59:05,661
You can film a video of it. 

1406
00:59:06,128 --> 00:59:06,994
But not the whole thing. 

1407
00:59:08,428 --> 00:59:10,194
This is my first time. 

1408
00:59:11,461 --> 00:59:12,994
I've only seen traditional Korean 

1409
00:59:12,994 --> 00:59:13,994
outdoor performances. 

1410
00:59:15,428 --> 00:59:17,161
- This is just like that. / - I know. 

1411
00:59:18,228 --> 00:59:19,328
They're here. 

1412
00:59:22,561 --> 00:59:25,394
(Focused) 

1413
00:59:27,861 --> 00:59:33,361
(The flamenco begins with the cantaor's singing) 

1414
00:59:33,961 --> 00:59:37,028
(They don't want to miss anything) 

1415
00:59:39,061 --> 00:59:46,028
(The bailaor starts dancing to the rhythm of palmas) 

1416
00:59:50,628 --> 00:59:57,428
(The dance moves have dynamic rhythms) 

1417
01:00:10,428 --> 01:00:12,394
(A perfect finish) 

1418
01:00:14,028 --> 01:00:15,261
That's so cool. 

1419
01:00:15,694 --> 01:00:17,261
Are you dancing after eating jamon? 

1420
01:00:26,761 --> 01:00:30,028
(A variety of flamenco performances continue) 

1421
01:00:30,028 --> 01:00:35,761
(They contain the joys and sorrows of gypsies) 

1422
01:00:50,428 --> 01:00:53,561
(They applaud thunderously) 

1423
01:00:53,561 --> 01:00:55,928
It was a dome-shaped venue. 

1424
01:00:55,928 --> 01:00:56,761
So the sound... 

1425
01:00:57,494 --> 01:00:59,561
They don't use speakers at all. 

1426
01:00:59,861 --> 01:01:02,061
The sound gathers in the dome. 

1427
01:01:05,294 --> 01:01:06,728
(The highlight of the flamenco performance) 

1428
01:01:06,728 --> 01:01:08,361
Someone is coming out. Who is that? 

1429
01:01:09,494 --> 01:01:14,861
(The bailaor's solo performance) 

1430
01:01:15,894 --> 01:01:16,628
He's handsome. 

1431
01:01:17,528 --> 01:01:19,028
He's very charming. 

1432
01:01:48,761 --> 01:01:51,961
(An amazing finale to a breathtaking performance) 

1433
01:01:54,761 --> 01:01:55,928
(The bailaor is so amazing) 

1434
01:01:56,394 --> 01:01:59,528
Their spirit and energy were extraordinary. 

1435
01:01:59,528 --> 01:02:02,128
I had goose bumps the whole time. 

1436
01:02:02,128 --> 01:02:06,394
I could feel all of the sorrow, emotions and passion 

1437
01:02:06,394 --> 01:02:08,594
of these people all at once from this performance. 

1438
01:02:08,594 --> 01:02:10,594
When you see performances like that, 

1439
01:02:10,594 --> 01:02:11,461
you get intrigued... 

1440
01:02:11,461 --> 01:02:12,894
- Because it's dreamy. / - That's right. 

1441
01:02:12,894 --> 01:02:15,394
- It's a little... / - You get very into it. 

1442
01:02:15,694 --> 01:02:17,694
When it ends, you sigh like this. 

1443
01:02:17,694 --> 01:02:18,861
You can't stand up right away 

1444
01:02:18,861 --> 01:02:20,128
after watching performances like that. 

1445
01:02:20,128 --> 01:02:22,194
It's quite moving. 

1446
01:02:22,194 --> 01:02:23,961
You have to go there and see it. 

1447
01:02:24,194 --> 01:02:25,328
- That's right. / - Yes. 

1448
01:02:25,328 --> 01:02:31,461
(Leechelin Tour's food map, tapas) 

1449
01:02:33,228 --> 01:02:37,628
(The passionate sun has set) 

1450
01:02:37,628 --> 01:02:39,828
- It's like a movie set. / - Isn't it so pretty? 

1451
01:02:39,828 --> 01:02:42,328
This place is El Born. 

1452
01:02:42,328 --> 01:02:46,294
You can feel the sensation of young artists here. 

1453
01:02:46,294 --> 01:02:49,028
- This place is the trendiest. / - They were so relaxed. 

1454
01:02:49,028 --> 01:02:50,161
And the hottest place in Barcelona. 

1455
01:02:50,161 --> 01:02:51,528
- It was amazing. / - It was the same in Venice. 

1456
01:02:52,394 --> 01:02:53,761
It feels really relaxed. 

1457
01:02:54,561 --> 01:02:56,294
Are we going shopping today? 

1458
01:02:56,294 --> 01:02:58,628
It's not ordinary shopping. 

1459
01:02:58,628 --> 01:02:59,894
We're going to shop for things to eat. 

1460
01:02:59,894 --> 01:03:02,594
We're here to shop for tapas. 

1461
01:03:02,594 --> 01:03:03,894
Koreans will say, 

1462
01:03:03,894 --> 01:03:05,994
"Do you want to go for beer after work?" 

1463
01:03:05,994 --> 01:03:07,661
- That's right. / - It's like that. 

1464
01:03:07,661 --> 01:03:10,594
They have a sentence for tapas. 

1465
01:03:10,594 --> 01:03:12,694
- "Vamos a tapear?" / - What does that mean? 

1466
01:03:13,128 --> 01:03:14,528
Do you want to go out for some tapas? 

1467
01:03:14,528 --> 01:03:17,094
- Vamos tapear? / - Yes. Vamos a tapear. 

1468
01:03:17,128 --> 01:03:18,728
It's my first time eating tapas. 

1469
01:03:18,728 --> 01:03:19,861
Originally... 

1470
01:03:20,028 --> 01:03:24,794
People would put a lid over 

1471
01:03:24,794 --> 01:03:27,961
leftover chorizo or ham in the old times. 

1472
01:03:27,961 --> 01:03:29,528
"Tapas" means "lids." 

1473
01:03:29,628 --> 01:03:32,994
Tapas originated from eating those small leftovers 

1474
01:03:32,994 --> 01:03:34,994
with some alcohol. 

1475
01:03:34,994 --> 01:03:37,828
They place it on your wine glass. 

1476
01:03:38,461 --> 01:03:41,461
- You grab it like this. / - Eat it, empty it and move on. 

1477
01:03:41,628 --> 01:03:44,428
Eat it, empty it and move on! 

1478
01:03:44,461 --> 01:03:48,394
(A small portion of food that is eaten with alcohol) 

1479
01:03:48,394 --> 01:03:49,394
Strictly speaking, 

1480
01:03:49,394 --> 01:03:53,628
if the gambas we ate came out in small portions, 

1481
01:03:53,628 --> 01:03:55,194
they will become tapas. 

1482
01:03:55,194 --> 01:03:57,194
They also classify it according to the kind. 

1483
01:03:57,194 --> 01:04:00,194
One kind is food that is preserved in salt... 

1484
01:04:00,194 --> 01:04:01,394
- Like chorizos. / - That's like blood sausage. 

1485
01:04:02,161 --> 01:04:03,828
- Like blood sausage. / - That looks good. 

1486
01:04:03,828 --> 01:04:07,028
There is also pinchos that comes out in skewers. 

1487
01:04:07,028 --> 01:04:10,428
The third is cazuelas. 

1488
01:04:10,428 --> 01:04:13,394
That's the ones with cazuela sauce. 

1489
01:04:13,394 --> 01:04:15,228
Tapas is a common name 

1490
01:04:15,228 --> 01:04:18,061
that encompasses so many different kinds of food. 

1491
01:04:18,061 --> 01:04:20,128
We need to do a tapas tour. 

1492
01:04:20,328 --> 01:04:22,028
- About... / - Several places? 

1493
01:04:22,028 --> 01:04:22,994
Yes, several places. 

1494
01:04:22,994 --> 01:04:24,494
We can only taste one type if we go to one place. 

1495
01:04:24,494 --> 01:04:26,928
We have to eat and move on, eat and move on. 

1496
01:04:26,928 --> 01:04:29,261
Okay. Good. 

1497
01:04:29,261 --> 01:04:31,694
- I got it. The peppers are first. / - Yes. 

1498
01:04:31,694 --> 01:04:35,028
- They call peppers "pimiento" here. / - Pimiento? 

1499
01:04:35,028 --> 01:04:37,461
(Fried peppers, $8.30) 

1500
01:04:37,661 --> 01:04:38,861
It's so pretty. 

1501
01:04:38,861 --> 01:04:43,061
(What will they think of their first tapas?) 

1502
01:04:44,794 --> 01:04:45,961
They're stir-fried peppers. 

1503
01:04:46,561 --> 01:04:47,894
- Yes, stir-fried peppers. / - Yes. 

1504
01:04:48,928 --> 01:04:50,894
Like roasted shishito peppers that aren't spicy. 

1505
01:04:51,361 --> 01:04:53,328
These stir-fried peppers are so good. 

1506
01:04:53,328 --> 01:04:55,594
- This is like kimchi. / - They're not spicy. 

1507
01:04:55,594 --> 01:04:58,394
I like non-spicy stir-fried pepper. 

1508
01:04:58,761 --> 01:05:00,561
I made those with shishito peppers at home. 

1509
01:05:00,561 --> 01:05:01,828
People who can cook, 

1510
01:05:01,828 --> 01:05:03,361
make food that they want to eat at home. 

1511
01:05:04,094 --> 01:05:05,194
- Isn't that so nice? / - That seems so nice. 

1512
01:05:05,894 --> 01:05:07,161
- These are... / - What are these? 

1513
01:05:07,161 --> 01:05:10,261
These are nuts and bread with dried fruits. 

1514
01:05:10,261 --> 01:05:11,594
Try it with the cheese. 

1515
01:05:11,594 --> 01:05:13,161
I like food like this. 

1516
01:05:13,861 --> 01:05:16,628
They have preserved tomatoes on top. 

1517
01:05:17,561 --> 01:05:18,961
(Spanish cheese, $12.70) 

1518
01:05:18,961 --> 01:05:22,294
Honey on top of cheese is always right. 

1519
01:05:22,294 --> 01:05:24,128
- This is... / - It's salty. 

1520
01:05:24,128 --> 01:05:26,561
(He's curious) 

1521
01:05:29,928 --> 01:05:31,294
The cheese is salty. 

1522
01:05:31,928 --> 01:05:33,061
The cheese is salty. 

1523
01:05:33,894 --> 01:05:35,961
I love frank expressions like this. 

1524
01:05:35,961 --> 01:05:38,994
I was frank. If it's salty, I said it was salty. 

1525
01:05:39,161 --> 01:05:40,794
- Really? / - That cheese was salty. 

1526
01:05:41,094 --> 01:05:45,061
This is Manchego Cheese. 

1527
01:05:45,494 --> 01:05:48,228
They made it with sheep milk in La Mancha region. 

1528
01:05:48,228 --> 01:05:49,661
- Manchego? / - Yes, Manchego. 

1529
01:05:49,661 --> 01:05:51,528
You really have to try this. 

1530
01:05:51,894 --> 01:05:53,594
The aroma is unique, 

1531
01:05:53,594 --> 01:05:55,061
like how the aroma of mutton is unique. 

1532
01:05:55,828 --> 01:05:56,928
It's delicious. 

1533
01:05:59,128 --> 01:06:00,461
This cheese is nice. 

1534
01:06:00,828 --> 01:06:02,028
The one I ate before was salty. 

1535
01:06:02,028 --> 01:06:04,228
(How will they evaluate the tapas?) 

1536
01:06:04,228 --> 01:06:07,594
5 stars for location. 3.5 stars for price. 

1537
01:06:07,594 --> 01:06:09,394
And 5 stars for ambience. 

1538
01:06:09,661 --> 01:06:11,294
The location and ambience was great. 

1539
01:06:11,294 --> 01:06:13,428
Delicious food and good service. 

1540
01:06:13,428 --> 01:06:15,628
Great place for your first tapas experience. 

1541
01:06:16,628 --> 01:06:20,294
(Average score for the first tapas place, 4.75 stars) 

1542
01:06:20,761 --> 01:06:22,094
For the second place, 

1543
01:06:22,094 --> 01:06:25,928
we will go to a place where we can eat pinchos. 

1544
01:06:25,928 --> 01:06:27,794
- One more drink. / - Going for round 2? 

1545
01:06:27,794 --> 01:06:29,161
- Let's go. / - Okay. 

1546
01:06:29,161 --> 01:06:31,061
People who like to drink really like tapas. 

1547
01:06:31,061 --> 01:06:32,861
They can order various kinds in small amounts. 

1548
01:06:32,861 --> 01:06:36,228
You can go to five different places like that. 

1549
01:06:36,561 --> 01:06:39,694
You can do a tapas tour. It's so nice. 

1550
01:06:39,961 --> 01:06:40,661
Where are we going? 

1551
01:06:40,661 --> 01:06:42,861
We don't have to walk. It's here. 

1552
01:06:43,428 --> 01:06:45,094
The pinchos place is right here. 

1553
01:06:45,094 --> 01:06:47,228
- Wonil, what is this? / - Yes? 

1554
01:06:47,228 --> 01:06:49,628
- They just keep eating and drinking. / - Yes. 

1555
01:06:49,628 --> 01:06:52,661
We ate, drank and moved on. 

1556
01:06:52,661 --> 01:06:56,928
This place has pinchos. Tapas with skewers. 

1557
01:06:56,928 --> 01:06:59,161
They calculate the price by counting the skewers 

1558
01:06:59,161 --> 01:07:00,128
that you ate. 

1559
01:07:00,728 --> 01:07:01,894
It's a tapas buffet. 

1560
01:07:01,894 --> 01:07:04,594
- Salads... / - Can you get whatever you want? 

1561
01:07:04,594 --> 01:07:06,428
You can get anything you want on your plate. 

1562
01:07:06,428 --> 01:07:07,594
It's like a buffet. 

1563
01:07:07,594 --> 01:07:09,094
We have to go here. 

1564
01:07:09,628 --> 01:07:12,761
It's $2.70 per skewer. 

1565
01:07:12,761 --> 01:07:15,828
You can have a beer with this and chat. 

1566
01:07:17,928 --> 01:07:20,728
These are anchovies... 

1567
01:07:20,728 --> 01:07:23,661
- Olives and peppers. / - Okay. 

1568
01:07:23,994 --> 01:07:26,328
(He carefully tastes it) 

1569
01:07:26,328 --> 01:07:27,594
I think this will be good. 

1570
01:07:27,594 --> 01:07:30,694
- It's salty but good with beer. / - Should I try it? 

1571
01:07:31,761 --> 01:07:34,128
(He eats it in one bite) 

1572
01:07:35,028 --> 01:07:36,828
Did you eat all of that? 

1573
01:07:38,494 --> 01:07:40,428
- Should I get one more? / - No, it's okay. 

1574
01:07:40,428 --> 01:07:41,961
- I'll get one more. / - It's okay. 

1575
01:07:42,561 --> 01:07:43,961
- And? / - These are anchovies. 

1576
01:07:43,961 --> 01:07:46,694
As you can tell, they're raw anchovies. 

1577
01:07:46,694 --> 01:07:49,128
Anchovies must be really good. 

1578
01:07:49,128 --> 01:07:50,961
I'm sure that it will definitely be salty for Hwijae. 

1579
01:07:50,961 --> 01:07:52,394
- Wasn't that salty? / - I don't think he will like it. 

1580
01:07:52,394 --> 01:07:53,894
I don't think it was that salty. 

1581
01:07:53,894 --> 01:07:55,794
Those are preserved in vinegar, 

1582
01:07:55,794 --> 01:07:57,194
so they're not that salty. 

1583
01:07:57,194 --> 01:07:58,561
The anchovies are not preserved in salt. 

1584
01:07:59,894 --> 01:08:02,528
- They don't suit Hwijae. / - They look good. 

1585
01:08:03,494 --> 01:08:04,661
It's a little too fishy for you, right? 

1586
01:08:05,161 --> 01:08:06,361
(A little) 

1587
01:08:06,361 --> 01:08:08,828
But it's not fishy. 

1588
01:08:08,828 --> 01:08:10,628
This isn't fishy. 

1589
01:08:10,628 --> 01:08:13,594
It's not fishy but it smells a little like the sea. 

1590
01:08:13,594 --> 01:08:15,028
(Anchovy pinchos with the scent of the Mediterranean) 

1591
01:08:15,028 --> 01:08:16,428
I'm looking forward to this one. 

1592
01:08:16,894 --> 01:08:19,294
- It's crab meat. / - It's real crab meat. 

1593
01:08:19,828 --> 01:08:22,528
It's crab meat salad with eggs on top. 

1594
01:08:22,528 --> 01:08:23,894
This looks good. 

1595
01:08:23,894 --> 01:08:26,294
- I'm looking forward to this. / - What's the white thing? 

1596
01:08:26,594 --> 01:08:28,794
They mixed crab meat with mayonnaise 

1597
01:08:28,794 --> 01:08:30,694
and put more crab meat on top. 

1598
01:08:31,428 --> 01:08:32,661
Where is the crab salad? 

1599
01:08:34,528 --> 01:08:37,194
(How will it taste?) 

1600
01:08:38,528 --> 01:08:44,128
(They react right away as soon as they eat it) 

1601
01:08:46,161 --> 01:08:48,861
Men and women of all ages will like this, right? 

1602
01:08:48,861 --> 01:08:50,094
This is... 

1603
01:08:50,928 --> 01:08:53,228
This is really the best. 

1604
01:08:53,228 --> 01:08:54,694
That must be good. 

1605
01:08:55,394 --> 01:08:57,161
This is cheating. 

1606
01:08:57,161 --> 01:08:58,394
This is really delicious. 

1607
01:08:58,394 --> 01:08:59,828
The whole family can eat this. 

1608
01:09:00,461 --> 01:09:02,561
- This is really delicious. / - Yes. 

1609
01:09:02,561 --> 01:09:03,828
I want to take this to Korea and sell this. 

1610
01:09:03,828 --> 01:09:07,128
They grated the egg whites with a cheese grater 

1611
01:09:07,128 --> 01:09:08,194
and put it on top. 

1612
01:09:08,194 --> 01:09:10,228
- I want to eat it. / - That will make it really soft. 

1613
01:09:10,228 --> 01:09:11,594
Yes, like that. 

1614
01:09:11,594 --> 01:09:13,028
Stop eating. 

1615
01:09:13,028 --> 01:09:14,228
(Fall in love with the charm of various kinds of tapas) 

1616
01:09:14,228 --> 01:09:16,428
Every restaurant has a break time, right? 

1617
01:09:16,428 --> 01:09:19,361
Tapas restaurants don't have a break. Always open. 

1618
01:09:20,028 --> 01:09:21,994
(We can't leave out the evaluation) 

1619
01:09:21,994 --> 01:09:25,594
For me, 4 stars for location. 5 stars for price. 

1620
01:09:26,228 --> 01:09:27,661
We ate all this... 

1621
01:09:28,194 --> 01:09:29,994
It's not over $15. 

1622
01:09:29,994 --> 01:09:32,428
I gave them 5 stars for everything. 

1623
01:09:32,428 --> 01:09:35,461
Since it's in El Born, I gave 5 stars for the location. 

1624
01:09:35,461 --> 01:09:37,828
5 stars because it's cheap. 

1625
01:09:37,828 --> 01:09:40,561
I really like this atmosphere because you can talk... 

1626
01:09:40,561 --> 01:09:42,328
- Intimately and eat here. / - The atmosphere is so nice. 

1627
01:09:42,794 --> 01:09:44,861
5 stars for everything. 

1628
01:09:45,561 --> 01:09:48,861
(Average score for second tapas place, 4.67 stars) 

1629
01:09:48,861 --> 01:09:50,428
The crab meat is really good. 

1630
01:09:50,761 --> 01:09:52,828
The crab meat isn't good. Our monkfish is better. 

1631
01:09:53,028 --> 01:09:55,628
This really is the last place in Barcelona. 

1632
01:09:55,628 --> 01:09:57,461
How much do we have to go? 

1633
01:09:57,461 --> 01:09:59,094
- You think we will go far... / - Yes. 

1634
01:09:59,094 --> 01:10:02,028
But we only have to turn a corner. It takes 2 minutes. 

1635
01:10:02,261 --> 01:10:03,428
- 2 minutes? / - Yes, 2 minutes. 

1636
01:10:04,128 --> 01:10:05,228
(Past the first restaurant) 

1637
01:10:05,228 --> 01:10:07,794
Turn the corner. Turn the corner here. 

1638
01:10:08,128 --> 01:10:10,461
Look at the night view. Is this a Catholic church? 

1639
01:10:10,461 --> 01:10:11,494
It's a night view. 

1640
01:10:11,761 --> 01:10:13,494
This is the night view. 

1641
01:10:13,728 --> 01:10:15,728
- Is this the night view? / - This is the night view. 

1642
01:10:15,728 --> 01:10:17,528
(Santa Maria del Mar) 

1643
01:10:17,528 --> 01:10:21,394
It's a tapas place that has a really nice atmosphere 

1644
01:10:21,394 --> 01:10:22,661
where you can eat tapas outside 

1645
01:10:22,661 --> 01:10:23,328
while enjoying the view. 

1646
01:10:23,328 --> 01:10:26,294
When it comes to views, 

1647
01:10:26,294 --> 01:10:27,594
it's the best place in El Born. 

1648
01:10:30,528 --> 01:10:33,928
(Olive skewers, $2.50) 

1649
01:10:34,661 --> 01:10:37,394
(Oysters, $3.90 per oyster) 

1650
01:10:40,928 --> 01:10:42,628
Adios, Barcelona. 

1651
01:10:44,061 --> 01:10:45,094
Adios. 

1652
01:10:48,294 --> 01:10:51,094
(They eat the last tapas with the beautiful night view) 

1653
01:10:51,094 --> 01:10:52,128
You should eat these like this. 

1654
01:10:52,328 --> 01:10:54,328
The seafood is really fresh because 

1655
01:10:54,328 --> 01:10:55,394
the city is near the sea. 

1656
01:10:55,394 --> 01:10:58,028
- We ate about 6 or 7 meals. / - Yes. 

1657
01:10:58,028 --> 01:10:59,594
Among those restaurants, 

1658
01:10:59,594 --> 01:11:02,328
what was your favorite menu? 

1659
01:11:03,128 --> 01:11:04,294
What should I pick? 

1660
01:11:04,294 --> 01:11:05,561
1, 2, 3. 

1661
01:11:05,561 --> 01:11:06,594
- Crayfish soup. / - Crayfish soup. 

1662
01:11:06,594 --> 01:11:08,361
(They didn't hesitate to choose crayfish soup) 

1663
01:11:09,494 --> 01:11:11,894
This! The arroz caldoso. 

1664
01:11:11,894 --> 01:11:12,994
(Sook agrees with Leechelin Tour) 

1665
01:11:12,994 --> 01:11:15,128
I really think that this is the best. 

1666
01:11:15,128 --> 01:11:17,061
I think it's better than the monkfish. 

1667
01:11:17,061 --> 01:11:19,528
(Leechelin Tour's final evaluation of Barcelona) 

1668
01:11:19,528 --> 01:11:21,928
(1st place, arroz caldoso, 4.8 stars) 

1669
01:11:22,594 --> 01:11:24,128
What do you think? 

1670
01:11:24,128 --> 01:11:26,161
- They will become really popular. / - Yes. 

1671
01:11:36,861 --> 01:11:40,794
(A city where Europe's past and future coexist) 

1672
01:11:42,528 --> 01:11:45,594
(They have original paellas) 

1673
01:11:46,394 --> 01:11:50,261
(It's a parade of food that cannot taste bad) 

1674
01:11:50,961 --> 01:11:55,094
(Valencia, Spain, will show a different side) 

1675
01:11:56,694 --> 01:12:00,194
(Look forward to Valencia, the beautiful gourmet city) 

1676
01:12:01,094 --> 01:12:02,394
- What is that? / - That can't be! 

1677
01:12:02,794 --> 01:12:05,394
- This is amazing. / - This is amazing. 

1678
01:12:05,994 --> 01:12:07,794
- Grate the garlic first. / - Grate the garlic on the bread. 

1679
01:12:07,794 --> 01:12:10,794
Why do you have something prepared again? 

1680
01:12:10,794 --> 01:12:12,461
Are you really going to do so many things like this? 

1681
01:12:12,461 --> 01:12:15,128
We wanted to demonstrate something simple. 

1682
01:12:15,128 --> 01:12:18,428
We also brought the extra virgin olive oil from 

1683
01:12:18,428 --> 01:12:20,261
La Boqueria earlier. 

1684
01:12:20,728 --> 01:12:22,728
How could you do this? 

1685
01:12:24,128 --> 01:12:26,628
Spain is famous for its olive oil. 

1686
01:12:26,628 --> 01:12:27,828
I want to try this. 

1687
01:12:28,461 --> 01:12:31,728
I brought it to show you how to use it. 

1688
01:12:32,128 --> 01:12:33,861
You can eat it. 

1689
01:12:34,961 --> 01:12:35,961
It's good. 

1690
01:12:36,328 --> 01:12:38,894
I'll show you how to eat pan con tomate. 

1691
01:12:38,894 --> 01:12:42,928
First, take the garlic like this and rub it on the bread. 

1692
01:12:43,261 --> 01:12:44,694
It will ground like this. 

1693
01:12:45,228 --> 01:12:47,161
Yes, it will ground like this. 

1694
01:12:47,161 --> 01:12:50,828
- After that, rub the tomato. / - The tomatoes. 

1695
01:12:50,828 --> 01:12:53,494
- Grind it. / - Crush it. 

1696
01:12:53,494 --> 01:12:55,028
- Crush it. / - Yes, crush it. 

1697
01:12:55,028 --> 01:12:59,728
It's like kimchi for the locals of Catalonia. 

1698
01:12:59,728 --> 01:13:00,728
That's right. 

1699
01:13:00,894 --> 01:13:04,394
- Put a lot of olive oil on it. / - Put olive oil next. 

1700
01:13:04,394 --> 01:13:07,094
- Put a lot. / - Put it on like this. 

1701
01:13:07,094 --> 01:13:09,261
- Can we just eat it like this? / - You can eat it like this. 

1702
01:13:09,261 --> 01:13:10,028
Try it. 

1703
01:13:14,194 --> 01:13:15,628
(Wow) 

1704
01:13:16,394 --> 01:13:17,628
What is this? 

1705
01:13:17,628 --> 01:13:19,828
- Why is this so good? / - Why is this so good? 

1706
01:13:19,828 --> 01:13:21,094
Why is this so good? 

1707
01:13:22,694 --> 01:13:25,294
(Lovelyz also try the pan con tomate) 

1708
01:13:25,728 --> 01:13:26,894
It's good! 

1709
01:13:29,361 --> 01:13:32,261
(The gourmet judges, PENTAGON, also try it) 

1710
01:13:34,761 --> 01:13:36,794
(Mmm) 

1711
01:13:38,061 --> 01:13:41,194
- It tastes like garlic bread. / - Yes? 

1712
01:13:41,761 --> 01:13:43,861
But it tastes a little more sophisticated. 

1713
01:13:43,861 --> 01:13:44,961
- Isn't that right? / - Yes. 

1714
01:13:44,961 --> 01:13:47,828
- It has a deeper taste. / - The difference is in the oil. 

1715
01:13:48,361 --> 01:13:51,061
- Does a chef have to make it? / - I think this is better. 

1716
01:13:51,861 --> 01:13:53,228
You removed the spaghetti? 

1717
01:13:53,428 --> 01:13:54,828
Jiae, 

1718
01:13:54,828 --> 01:13:57,561
will you stop by Barcelona for your honeymoon? 

1719
01:13:58,394 --> 01:14:01,694
I'll think about it for a minute. 

1720
01:14:03,028 --> 01:14:06,161
- Why is this so good though? / - Why is this so good? 

1721
01:14:06,161 --> 01:14:07,794
You can do this at home. 

1722
01:14:08,394 --> 01:14:10,228
You must have garlic at home. 

1723
01:14:10,228 --> 01:14:12,861
All you need is tomatoes and olive oil. 

1724
01:14:12,861 --> 01:14:14,561
- That's right. / - You can eat this at home. 

1725
01:14:14,561 --> 01:14:16,628
It seems like a grand dish. 

1726
01:14:16,894 --> 01:14:18,294
We should continue the corner inside a corner. 

1727
01:14:18,294 --> 01:14:21,194
The corner inside a corner, Sook's Choice. 

1728
01:14:21,194 --> 01:14:22,561
