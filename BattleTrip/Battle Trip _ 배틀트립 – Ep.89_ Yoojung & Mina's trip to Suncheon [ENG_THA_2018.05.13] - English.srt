Nice to see you again. The special host for today

00:00:18,677 --> 00:00:20,043
is Jooe.

8
00:00:20,043 --> 00:00:21,410
- Welcome. / - Welcome.

9
00:00:21,410 --> 00:00:22,977
Hello.

10
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:25,810
I'm Jooe of MOMOLAND.

11
00:00:25,810 --> 00:00:27,477
I'll be a great host with the spirit

12
00:00:27,477 --> 00:00:29,010
of a 20-year-old girl.

13
00:00:31,543 --> 00:00:34,377
How are you going to show that spirit?

14
00:00:35,143 --> 00:00:35,843
What are you doing?

15
00:00:36,643 --> 00:00:37,343
What are you doing?

16
00:00:37,343 --> 00:00:37,977
What's wrong?

("BBoom BBoom" by MOMOLAND)

18
00:00:46,810 --> 00:00:48,043
Great!

19
00:00:50,243 --> 00:00:52,510
- Whatever she does, she's cute. / - So cute.

20
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:55,477
- That's what 20-year-olds are like. / - 20s...

21
00:00:55,477 --> 00:00:57,310
She's energetic from the start.

22
00:00:57,310 --> 00:00:58,010
That's good.

23
00:00:58,010 --> 00:01:00,577
A special trip is prepared today.

24
00:01:00,577 --> 00:01:01,643
Yes, it's very special.

25
00:01:01,643 --> 00:01:02,877
What is it?

26
00:01:02,877 --> 00:01:06,477
We prepared an event for this special trip.

27
00:01:06,477 --> 00:01:08,243
Battle Trip has a book now.

28
00:01:08,243 --> 00:01:09,677
- We published a book. / - We have a book now.

29
00:01:09,677 --> 00:01:10,577
We will...

30
00:01:10,577 --> 00:01:13,510
- Finally. / - Randomly select those who...

31
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:15,310
Watch the broadcast and award them books.

32
00:01:16,043 --> 00:01:19,443
From last week's 30-second preview,

33
00:01:19,443 --> 00:01:22,443
Battle Trip was reported in the most number of articles.

34
00:01:22,443 --> 00:01:24,243
- That trip is today's... / - Why was that the case?

35
00:01:24,243 --> 00:01:25,277
It's because...

36
00:01:25,277 --> 00:01:26,810
- Special people are here today. / - So fresh.

37
00:01:26,810 --> 00:01:29,077
They're fresh 20-year-olds.

38
00:01:31,477 --> 00:01:32,843
Jooe is also 20 years old.

39
00:01:32,843 --> 00:01:34,143
Yes, I was born in 1999.

40
00:01:34,143 --> 00:01:34,977
She was born in 1999.

41
00:01:37,210 --> 00:01:38,543
Guess what year was I born?

42
00:01:38,543 --> 00:01:39,443
I was born in 1979.

43
00:01:40,743 --> 00:01:41,577
Nice to meet you.

44
00:01:41,577 --> 00:01:42,443
- Excuse me? / - Wait a minute.

45
00:01:42,443 --> 00:01:43,243
Then...

46
00:01:43,243 --> 00:01:43,977
Why are you saying this?

47
00:01:43,977 --> 00:01:45,443
They're exactly 20 years apart?

48
00:01:45,443 --> 00:01:46,510
Exactly 20.

49
00:01:47,677 --> 00:01:48,310
Father?

50
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:49,243
- What? / - Father.

51
00:01:49,877 --> 00:01:50,710
As for me...

52
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:52,443
- Were you born in 1972? / - I won't say what year.

53
00:01:52,443 --> 00:01:53,477
Year of the Rat.

54
00:01:53,477 --> 00:01:54,677
I was born in the Year of the Rat.

55
00:01:55,377 --> 00:01:57,210
These days, people don't talk about

56
00:01:57,210 --> 00:01:58,477
their Chinese zodiac sign.

57
00:01:58,477 --> 00:01:59,410
They won't.

58
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:00,577
If someone talks about it...

59
00:02:00,577 --> 00:02:03,177
- That shows you're old. / - That's right.

60
00:02:03,177 --> 00:02:04,943
Instead of Year of the Tiger...

61
00:02:04,943 --> 00:02:07,310
- If you say it like Year of the Panthera. / - Panthera?

62
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:08,343
"Where did you go?"

63
00:02:08,343 --> 00:02:09,510
"Europa."

64
00:02:09,510 --> 00:02:10,710
You're really old if you say that.

65
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:12,310
That's such an old word.

66
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:14,310
It's a really special trip today.

67
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:16,143
Today's theme is,

68
00:02:16,143 --> 00:02:18,110
Spring flower trip at 20.

69
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:20,743
It feels so fresh.

70
00:02:20,743 --> 00:02:22,277
I feel the flowers budding.

71
00:02:22,277 --> 00:02:23,710
(Fresh)

72
00:02:24,277 --> 00:02:26,610
How old are the

73
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:28,377
100 judges today?

74
00:02:28,377 --> 00:02:29,677
20 years old!

75
00:02:31,743 --> 00:02:34,610
We have 100 people who are 20 years old.

76
00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:35,777
That's right.

77
00:02:35,777 --> 00:02:38,077
Let's hear how our youngest Sikyung was

78
00:02:38,077 --> 00:02:40,110
at 20 years old.

79
00:02:41,277 --> 00:02:42,310
During our time...

80
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:44,077
In "My Sassy Girl,"

81
00:02:44,077 --> 00:02:45,777
Gianna Jun and Cha Taehyun

82
00:02:45,777 --> 00:02:48,610
show off their ID cards after turning the legal age.

83
00:02:48,610 --> 00:02:49,910
They do this.

84
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:51,443
They enter a bar.

85
00:02:51,443 --> 00:02:53,077
That was a scene in the movie.

86
00:02:53,077 --> 00:02:55,843
It was a dream for 20-year-olds.

87
00:02:55,843 --> 00:02:57,877
That's right. When you enter a place...

88
00:02:57,877 --> 00:02:58,710
Did you do that too?

89
00:02:58,710 --> 00:02:59,710
No, no, no.

90
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:01,743
What's your dream then?

91
00:03:01,743 --> 00:03:04,977
For me, when I'm stressed,

92
00:03:04,977 --> 00:03:08,143
I want to go to the karaoke room after 10 p.m.

93
00:03:08,143 --> 00:03:10,277
Whenever our schedules are over,

94
00:03:10,277 --> 00:03:12,410
we couldn't find the right place

95
00:03:12,410 --> 00:03:14,610
to relieve stress.

96
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:15,977
- When you were underage? / - Yes.

97
00:03:15,977 --> 00:03:17,743
- But now... / - Did you go when you became 20?

98
00:03:17,743 --> 00:03:19,077
I did!

99
00:03:19,077 --> 00:03:21,210
- Really? / - I burned it up.

100
00:03:21,210 --> 00:03:22,143
In the karaoke room?

101
00:03:22,143 --> 00:03:23,210
Yes.

102
00:03:23,210 --> 00:03:25,877
- Where else did you go? / - It was crazy.

103
00:03:25,877 --> 00:03:28,243
Other things I've done are like,

104
00:03:28,243 --> 00:03:30,277
with the members at the dorm...

105
00:03:30,277 --> 00:03:31,977
- Just... / - Did you drink beer?

106
00:03:31,977 --> 00:03:32,943
Did you drink beer?

107
00:03:36,477 --> 00:03:37,077
How was it?

108
00:03:37,077 --> 00:03:38,910
You drank so much your hair is beer color.

109
00:03:40,877 --> 00:03:42,243
Right. Old people used to

110
00:03:42,243 --> 00:03:43,477
dye their hair with beer.

111
00:03:43,477 --> 00:03:45,477
Don't say things like that. It's so sad.

112
00:03:45,477 --> 00:03:46,977
There must be so many things

113
00:03:46,977 --> 00:03:48,443
she'd want to do now that she's 20.

114
00:03:48,443 --> 00:03:49,477
It's the start for you.

115
00:03:50,343 --> 00:03:52,677
Today, it's a trip for fresh youth

116
00:03:52,677 --> 00:03:53,877
that just turned 20.

117
00:03:53,877 --> 00:03:55,577
They went on a spring flower trip.

118
00:03:55,577 --> 00:03:58,243
I'm curious about where they went.

119
00:03:58,243 --> 00:04:00,010
First, our 20-year-olds...

120
00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:01,977
- Trip planners, please come out. / - Come out.

121
00:04:05,543 --> 00:04:07,677
(Park Jihoon, Park Woojin of Wanna One)

122
00:04:08,777 --> 00:04:10,543
(Mina of Gugudan, Yoojung of Weki Meki)

123
00:04:12,877 --> 00:04:14,277
Seeing them like this, it's...

124
00:04:14,277 --> 00:04:17,077
- Wanna One and I.O.I. / - That's right.

125
00:04:17,077 --> 00:04:18,510
- I.O.I vs. Wanna One. / - Wanna One.

126
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:19,777
- That's the battle today. / - That's right.

127
00:04:19,777 --> 00:04:21,310
20 years old...

128
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:23,677
You'll all be adults soon.

129
00:04:23,677 --> 00:04:24,277
- Yes. / - Yes.

130
00:04:24,277 --> 00:04:26,777
Is there something you dreamed about doing.

131
00:04:26,777 --> 00:04:29,110
- The thing you want to do most. / - Something...

132
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:31,443
You want to be able to do now that you're an adult.

133
00:04:31,443 --> 00:04:32,777
I want to do this.

134
00:04:32,777 --> 00:04:35,377
- Where? / - When we go to after-work dinners...

135
00:04:35,377 --> 00:04:36,910
I want to be able to

136
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:38,443
drink with the older members.

137
00:04:39,810 --> 00:04:41,677
- You want to drink alcohol? / - Yeah.

138
00:04:41,677 --> 00:04:44,377
Also, I'm into cars.

139
00:04:44,377 --> 00:04:45,277
Driver's license?

140
00:04:45,277 --> 00:04:46,477
Yes, I want to get my license.

141
00:04:46,477 --> 00:04:47,577
That's right.

142
00:04:47,577 --> 00:04:49,110
What about Mina and Yoojung?

143
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:51,377
For me...

144
00:04:51,377 --> 00:04:53,677
I want to watch soccer with my parents

145
00:04:53,677 --> 00:04:55,810
and have chicken and beer.

146
00:04:55,810 --> 00:04:56,743
Or...

147
00:04:56,743 --> 00:04:58,210
Clink glasses with my parents

148
00:04:58,210 --> 00:05:00,343
when they drink soju.

149
00:05:00,343 --> 00:05:02,377
- I'm hoping for that. / - It's all about alcohol.

150
00:05:03,977 --> 00:05:06,010
We could only drink after our birthday.

151
00:05:06,010 --> 00:05:09,377
- That's right. / - Now you can drink from January 1st.

152
00:05:09,377 --> 00:05:11,310
- They must have drunk a lot. / - Of course.

153
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:12,310
Really?

154
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:14,377
- You can do it now then. / - Yes.

155
00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:19,577
When do you feel like you're really an adult now?

156
00:05:19,577 --> 00:05:21,010
Recently,

157
00:05:21,010 --> 00:05:24,310
I bought a transportation card because I needed it.

158
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:25,510
I went to register and

159
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:27,743
I couldn't register as a teenager.

160
00:05:27,743 --> 00:05:29,310
That made me realize

161
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:30,710
I was 20 now.

162
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:32,377
It hit me.

163
00:05:33,210 --> 00:05:35,377
When I say hello

164
00:05:35,377 --> 00:05:37,543
to the driver when I'm in a taxi,

165
00:05:37,543 --> 00:05:38,843
The driver used to say,

166
00:05:38,843 --> 00:05:40,210
"Where are you going, kid?"

167
00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:41,110
But they ask me,

168
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:43,543
"Where are you going, young lady?" these days.

169
00:05:43,543 --> 00:05:44,843
It surprises me and makes me think,

170
00:05:44,843 --> 00:05:46,777
"Does it show?"

171
00:05:46,777 --> 00:05:48,910
- It makes me think like that. / - "Does it show?"

172
00:05:48,910 --> 00:05:49,977
Do you like to be called young lady?

173
00:05:49,977 --> 00:05:52,343
- That's cute. / - It feels new to me.

174
00:05:52,343 --> 00:05:53,977
- Before... / - Since it's the first time you've heard it.

175
00:05:53,977 --> 00:05:55,443
- Young lady. / - That's right.

176
00:05:56,443 --> 00:05:57,877
Let's start Battle Trip now.

177
00:05:57,877 --> 00:06:01,410
Today's special is a spring flower trip at 20.

178
00:06:01,410 --> 00:06:03,443
Where did you go for your flower trip?

179
00:06:04,077 --> 00:06:06,277
We went to Suncheon, which is currently having

180
00:06:06,277 --> 00:06:09,210
a spring flower festival, then went to Gwangyang.

181
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:11,577
- Suncheon and Gwangyang. / - Right.

182
00:06:11,577 --> 00:06:13,177
This team...

183
00:06:13,177 --> 00:06:14,643
Must have a lot to eat.

184
00:06:14,643 --> 00:06:15,877
Suncheon has delicious food.

185
00:06:15,877 --> 00:06:18,177
Suncheon has a lot of good restaurants there.

186
00:06:18,177 --> 00:06:19,443
You can't leave Gwangyang out.

187
00:06:19,443 --> 00:06:20,543
Gwangyang as well.

188
00:06:20,543 --> 00:06:21,977
Gwangyang is amazing.

189
00:06:21,977 --> 00:06:23,043
Can we look forward to an eating show?

190
00:06:23,043 --> 00:06:25,043
- Of course. / - You can look forward to it.

191
00:06:25,043 --> 00:06:26,377
Mina, can we really look forward to it?

192
00:06:26,377 --> 00:06:28,610
I gave up being on a diet on this trip.

193
00:06:29,943 --> 00:06:31,110
Did you eat a lot on this trip?

194
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:33,177
Yes, on this trip,

195
00:06:33,177 --> 00:06:35,177
we just ate, ate, ate, ate and

196
00:06:35,177 --> 00:06:37,610
then took photos in between.

197
00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:41,210
That's what the tour was about.

198
00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:42,877
Did you see flowers?

199
00:06:42,877 --> 00:06:46,277
Yes, we saw 100 million flowers.

200
00:06:46,277 --> 00:06:47,310

201
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:48,277

- 100 million flowers. / - 100 million flowers.

203
00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:53,143
We went to a park where

204
00:06:53,143 --> 00:06:54,477
100 million flowers were in bloom.

205
00:06:55,077 --> 00:06:55,710
Right away...

206
00:06:55,710 --> 00:06:56,477
She started singing

207
00:06:56,477 --> 00:06:57,443
when she heard 100 million flowers.

208
00:06:57,443 --> 00:06:58,310

Our daughter.

213
00:07:14,010 --> 00:07:15,210
Nice.

214
00:07:15,210 --> 00:07:16,943
Jihoon and Woojin,

215
00:07:16,943 --> 00:07:17,877
where did you go?

216
00:07:17,877 --> 00:07:19,810
We started from Jinju and

217
00:07:19,810 --> 00:07:21,543
went to Hadong,

218
00:07:21,543 --> 00:07:23,810
which has the most beautiful flower path in Korea.

219
00:07:24,343 --> 00:07:26,243
- Jinju... / - Don't we have something impressive?

220
00:07:26,243 --> 00:07:27,643
They have 100 million flowers.

221
00:07:27,643 --> 00:07:28,610
Of course we do.

222
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:31,043
We went to the 10 ri flower road.

223
00:07:31,043 --> 00:07:32,410
Do you know of it?

224
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:33,877
- 10 ri? / - Cherry blossoms all the way?

225
00:07:33,877 --> 00:07:35,910
- Oh, 4km? / - 10 ri as in 4km.

226
00:07:36,677 --> 00:07:38,910
Have you ever showered in cherry blossoms?

227
00:07:38,910 --> 00:07:40,943
- A shower? / - With cherry blossoms?

228
00:07:41,877 --> 00:07:43,910
That's how many petals there were?

229
00:07:43,910 --> 00:07:46,010
You'll be shocked when you see.

230
00:07:46,010 --> 00:07:47,810
- Enough to take a shower? / - Seriously.

231
00:07:47,810 --> 00:07:49,043
Okay then.

232
00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:52,143
Flower trip of 20-year-olds.

233
00:07:52,143 --> 00:07:53,977
It's Hadong vs. Suncheon.

234
00:07:53,977 --> 00:07:55,543
People might think that

235
00:07:55,543 --> 00:07:58,643
it's an unexpected place

236
00:07:58,643 --> 00:08:00,743
for 20-year-olds to travel.

237
00:08:00,743 --> 00:08:02,843
These places are known as

238
00:08:02,843 --> 00:08:05,610
the hottest places on social media.

239
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:08,277
A lot of young people like these places.

240
00:08:08,277 --> 00:08:11,977
That's why we went there on Battle Trip.

241
00:08:11,977 --> 00:08:13,943
Let's check out the map

242
00:08:13,943 --> 00:08:16,243
and see where they went.

243
00:08:16,243 --> 00:08:18,743
You have to keep going down.

244
00:08:18,743 --> 00:08:20,510
It's much faster nowadays.

245
00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:21,877
It's quite far.

246
00:08:21,877 --> 00:08:24,977
Jinju, Hadong. Gwangyang, Suncheon.

247
00:08:24,977 --> 00:08:26,410
Isn't that Hwagae Market?

248
00:08:26,410 --> 00:08:27,277
- That's right. / - It is.

249
00:08:27,277 --> 00:08:28,110
You're right.

250
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:30,310
Between Gyeongsang-do and Jeolla-do.

251
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:32,510
Looking at the map,

252
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:35,210
I think you could go to Jinju, then Hadong,

253
00:08:35,210 --> 00:08:36,977
then Gwangyang, and Suncheon in one trip.

254
00:08:36,977 --> 00:08:37,843
Right, if you have the time.

255
00:08:37,843 --> 00:08:40,443
If you have enough time, that's the best way.

256
00:08:40,443 --> 00:08:41,877
Jinju is famous for cold noodles.

257
00:08:41,877 --> 00:08:43,043
Of course, it's famous.

258
00:08:43,043 --> 00:08:44,910
- Do you know? / - Of course.

259
00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:46,777
Honestly, I didn't know.

260
00:08:46,777 --> 00:08:49,610
I was searching for good restaurants in Jinju...

261
00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:51,810
- I found it was famous for cold noodles. / - Very famous.

262
00:08:51,810 --> 00:08:52,777
So we went there right away.

263
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:55,677
What's in Hadong?

264
00:08:55,677 --> 00:08:57,910
We spent a lot of money

265
00:08:57,910 --> 00:08:59,343
in Hadong.

266
00:08:59,343 --> 00:09:00,210
- Did you spend some money? / - Yes.

267
00:09:00,210 --> 00:09:02,277
We ate Korean beef

268
00:09:02,277 --> 00:09:04,343
in the end.

269
00:09:04,343 --> 00:09:05,643
I can't wait.

270
00:09:05,643 --> 00:09:07,077
- Everyone will get excited by the beef. / - But...

271
00:09:07,077 --> 00:09:08,777
Since we're talking about food...

272
00:09:08,777 --> 00:09:11,010
Once we complete our promotions,

273
00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:13,477
our reins are removed.

274
00:09:13,477 --> 00:09:14,410
We eat like it's an eating show.

275
00:09:14,410 --> 00:09:16,277
You don't have to show your midriffs anymore.

276
00:09:16,277 --> 00:09:17,877
That's right. Look at me.

277
00:09:20,377 --> 00:09:23,977
So I'm really looking forward to their eating show.

278
00:09:23,977 --> 00:09:26,810
Did you know that Suncheon,

279
00:09:26,810 --> 00:09:28,177
where Yoojung and Mina went,

280
00:09:28,177 --> 00:09:31,543
is a pilgrimage for Rail-Ro train travelers?

281
00:09:31,543 --> 00:09:32,310
Rail-Ro?

282
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:34,577
It's for Koreans under 29.

283
00:09:34,577 --> 00:09:37,077
It's an unlimited train travel pass

284
00:09:37,077 --> 00:09:41,710
that can be used in any train in Korea.

285
00:09:42,643 --> 00:09:44,143
- Is there something like that? / - You can't use it.

286
00:09:44,143 --> 00:09:45,977
There are dates for that.

287
00:09:45,977 --> 00:09:47,243
- That's right. / - They have specific dates.

288
00:09:47,243 --> 00:09:48,977
You can choose either 5 days or 7 days.

289
00:09:48,977 --> 00:09:50,410
You can plan according to...

290
00:09:50,410 --> 00:09:52,043
- Your travel route. / - If you buy that pass...

291
00:09:52,043 --> 00:09:53,343
Can you ride a train anywhere?

292
00:09:53,343 --> 00:09:54,210
You can ride to anywhere.

293
00:09:54,210 --> 00:09:55,443
The entire country.

294
00:09:55,443 --> 00:09:57,910
Think of it as an unlimited pass for 5 days.

295
00:09:57,910 --> 00:09:58,543
That's right.

296
00:09:58,543 --> 00:10:00,277
Also in Suncheon...

297
00:10:00,277 --> 00:10:02,210
You can get free accommodation.

298
00:10:02,210 --> 00:10:04,077
Or you can hire a bus.

299
00:10:04,077 --> 00:10:07,177
- There are many services. / - It's a service.

300
00:10:07,177 --> 00:10:08,677
It's very nice.

301
00:10:08,677 --> 00:10:09,843
That's good.

302
00:10:09,843 --> 00:10:11,277
- Anyway. / - First off...

303
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:13,343
Let's go see the 100 million flowers first.

304
00:10:13,343 --> 00:10:14,377
We'll go to Suncheon.

305
00:10:14,377 --> 00:10:15,843

Before we started the trip,

312
00:10:30,377 --> 00:10:32,677
we prepared a small event.

313
00:10:32,677 --> 00:10:36,177

I want to do this

359

I want to try the cocktails there.

363
00:12:31,043 --> 00:12:33,010
- At a fancy bar? / - While listening to music...

364
00:12:33,010 --> 00:12:34,610
A glass of cocktail.

365
00:12:35,743 --> 00:12:37,643
Your mind is already at the bar.

366
00:12:37,643 --> 00:12:38,977
I want to

367
00:12:38,977 --> 00:12:40,510
do something like

368
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:42,243
riding a bicycle with you.

369
00:12:42,243 --> 00:12:43,843
But I don't know how to ride one.

370
00:12:43,843 --> 00:12:44,310
Huh?

371
00:12:45,510 --> 00:12:48,177
- Huh? / - If we ride a 2-man bicycle...

372
00:12:48,177 --> 00:12:49,810
I can only go straight.

373
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:50,943
You can drive the bicycle.

374
00:12:50,943 --> 00:12:52,210
Right...

375
00:12:52,210 --> 00:12:53,843
You can enjoy the view while I drive the bicycle.

376
00:12:53,843 --> 00:12:54,677
I got it.

377
00:12:54,677 --> 00:12:55,943
Also...

378
00:12:55,943 --> 00:12:57,877
In junior high,

379
00:12:57,877 --> 00:13:00,043
the twin look was trending.

380
00:13:00,043 --> 00:13:00,810
That's right.

381
00:13:00,810 --> 00:13:02,910
I've never worn a matching outfit with my friend.

382
00:13:02,910 --> 00:13:04,710
And I want to...

383
00:13:04,710 --> 00:13:06,977
Go drinking...

384
00:13:11,177 --> 00:13:12,243
I want to drink.

385
00:13:12,243 --> 00:13:14,010
It must be fun just imagining it.

386
00:13:14,643 --> 00:13:16,577
From a long time ago,

387
00:13:16,577 --> 00:13:18,977
I've wanted to go backpacking on a train.

388
00:13:18,977 --> 00:13:20,243
That's a great idea.

389
00:13:20,943 --> 00:13:22,577
Since it's spring now,

390
00:13:22,577 --> 00:13:23,910
we must go see the flowers.

391
00:13:24,877 --> 00:13:27,443
- I've been thinking about it. / - Really?

392
00:13:27,443 --> 00:13:29,043
If we're going to see flowers,

393
00:13:29,043 --> 00:13:30,677
we have to see a field that's

394
00:13:30,677 --> 00:13:32,643
covered with flowers.

395
00:13:33,343 --> 00:13:34,410
While we're at it.

396
00:13:34,410 --> 00:13:37,210
Let's go to a place with a whole field of flowers.

397
00:13:38,443 --> 00:13:39,710
I've done my research.

398
00:13:39,710 --> 00:13:43,343
Suncheonman National Garden's spring flower festival.

399
00:13:43,343 --> 00:13:46,477
The festival lasts from April 6th to May 22th.

400
00:13:46,477 --> 00:13:48,243
Are there a lot of flowers in Suncheon?

401
00:13:48,243 --> 00:13:51,210
- For that long? / - I really want to go to a festival.

402
00:13:51,210 --> 00:13:53,277
This proves that the flowers over there

403
00:13:53,277 --> 00:13:54,743
are so strong.

404
00:13:56,143 --> 00:13:58,143
Are you saying the soil there is fertile?

405
00:13:58,143 --> 00:14:00,343
Yes, because of that,

406
00:14:00,343 --> 00:14:01,710
you can see flowers until May.

407
00:14:01,710 --> 00:14:03,777
The flowers will still be in bloom...

408
00:14:03,777 --> 00:14:05,977
- Even after this show airs. / - Right, right.

409
00:14:05,977 --> 00:14:07,477
The festival ends on May 22th.

410
00:14:08,843 --> 00:14:10,743
- I really want to go see flowers. / - Right?

411
00:14:10,743 --> 00:14:13,677
- We can take photos. / - Flowers like this.

412
00:14:15,343 --> 00:14:16,710
There are a lot of tulips.

413
00:14:16,710 --> 00:14:17,510
Look at that.

414
00:14:18,710 --> 00:14:20,043
And this place is...

415
00:14:21,343 --> 00:14:23,110
This is where you can take the best photos.

416
00:14:23,110 --> 00:14:25,077
- This place is really nice. / - Right?

417
00:14:25,077 --> 00:14:27,010
Flowers are everywhere.

418
00:14:27,010 --> 00:14:28,910
I read that Suncheon is

419
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:30,810
a must visit place to go by train

420
00:14:30,810 --> 00:14:32,843
for travelers who are in their 20s.

421
00:14:33,577 --> 00:14:34,543
That's what you were after.

422
00:14:34,543 --> 00:14:35,910
- Yeah. / - That's what you're after.

423
00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:36,910
- You were. / - At first...

424
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:38,743
I planned a train trip from the start.

425
00:14:39,377 --> 00:14:41,410
There's also that.

426
00:14:41,410 --> 00:14:44,010
It's a place that's set up to show

427
00:14:44,010 --> 00:14:47,677
what Korea was like in the 1960s and 1970s.

428
00:14:48,677 --> 00:14:49,877
So...

429
00:14:49,877 --> 00:14:52,443
It's like going back in time.

430
00:14:53,443 --> 00:14:54,810
You and I

431
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:57,377
can go back in time too.

432
00:14:57,377 --> 00:14:58,477
This is nice.

433
00:14:58,477 --> 00:14:59,610
The Yoobom Nabom Trip.

434
00:14:59,610 --> 00:15:00,943
You feel like crying again, right?

435
00:15:00,943 --> 00:15:02,743
Anyway, we can try that.

436
00:15:02,743 --> 00:15:04,610
We can take a lot of photos here.

437
00:15:04,610 --> 00:15:06,810
I only picked

438
00:15:06,810 --> 00:15:08,777
the destination which is Suncheon

439
00:15:08,777 --> 00:15:10,577
and the transportation, the train.

440
00:15:10,577 --> 00:15:12,243
Next to

441
00:15:12,243 --> 00:15:13,377
Suncheon,

442
00:15:13,377 --> 00:15:14,877
Yeosu and Gwangyang are located.

443
00:15:14,877 --> 00:15:16,610
- That's the whole itinerary. / - Yes.

444
00:15:16,610 --> 00:15:18,743
- Yeosu, Suncheon and Gwangyang. / - Yeosu is nice.

445
00:15:18,743 --> 00:15:20,210
- Yeosu is great. / - But...

446
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:23,843
Yeosu has been introduced on Battle Trip already.

447
00:15:23,843 --> 00:15:25,343
But they showed a tiny part

448
00:15:25,343 --> 00:15:26,843
of Gwangyang that time.

449
00:15:26,843 --> 00:15:29,343
Like a brief preview.

450
00:15:29,343 --> 00:15:32,010
We can introduce the city thoroughly this time.

451
00:15:32,010 --> 00:15:34,743
- We'll be thorough. / - Yes, thoroughly.

452
00:15:34,743 --> 00:15:37,077
Gwangyang is famous for bulgogi.

453
00:15:37,077 --> 00:15:38,943
Bulgogi.

454
00:15:38,943 --> 00:15:40,210
Gwangyang bulgogi.

455
00:15:40,210 --> 00:15:42,943
- Yes, we have that. / - We can introduce that.

456
00:15:42,943 --> 00:15:44,377
- We can... / - You look so happy.

457
00:15:44,377 --> 00:15:45,977
We can try the bulgogi too.

458
00:15:45,977 --> 00:15:49,277
Let's find a lot of fun things to do there.

459
00:15:49,277 --> 00:15:52,043
Let's make our trip amazing.

460
00:15:52,043 --> 00:15:54,210
You find out more about Suncheon.

461
00:15:54,210 --> 00:15:55,610
I'll find more about Gwangyang.

462
00:15:55,610 --> 00:15:56,443
Okay.

463
00:15:56,443 --> 00:15:57,243
Should we clap?

464
00:16:00,277 --> 00:16:01,710
We have a great plan.

465
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:03,177
Right. Then...

466
00:16:03,177 --> 00:16:05,177
Let's name our trip.

467
00:16:05,177 --> 00:16:07,110
My name is Yoojung and you're Mina.

468
00:16:07,110 --> 00:16:08,543
And it's spring or "bom."

469
00:16:08,543 --> 00:16:10,043
Mina, Yoojung...

470
00:16:10,043 --> 00:16:12,443
Yoojung. Yoobom, Nabom.

471
00:16:12,443 --> 00:16:14,643
And Yoo sounds like "you."

472
00:16:14,643 --> 00:16:16,443
So it's like your spring, my spring.

473
00:16:16,443 --> 00:16:18,743
- Like you and me. / - Yes, like that.

474
00:16:18,743 --> 00:16:20,443
- Sounds great. / - Yoojung, Mina.

475
00:16:20,443 --> 00:16:22,110
- Yoobom Nabom. / - I like it.

476
00:16:22,110 --> 00:16:23,743
You and me.

477
00:16:23,743 --> 00:16:25,210
- Your spring, my spring. / - My spring.

478
00:16:25,210 --> 00:16:27,377
Yoobom Nabom.

479
00:16:27,377 --> 00:16:28,577
Let's go!

480
00:16:29,977 --> 00:16:32,810
- So natural. / - They sound different.

481
00:16:32,810 --> 00:16:34,543
♪ Are you ready? ♪

482
00:16:34,543 --> 00:16:36,510
♪ I'm ready ♪

483
00:16:36,510 --> 00:16:39,343
♪ Spring, spring, spring, spring is here ♪

484
00:16:39,343 --> 00:16:40,743
- Yoobom. / - Nabom.

485
00:16:40,743 --> 00:16:42,110
Spring is here!

486
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:44,677
Looks so fun.

487
00:16:44,677 --> 00:16:46,910
(Fascinated)

488
00:16:46,910 --> 00:16:47,977
It's a swing!

489
00:16:47,977 --> 00:16:48,977
Want me to push you?

490
00:16:50,210 --> 00:16:51,777
(She steps on the flowers)

491
00:16:51,777 --> 00:16:53,343
I stepped on the flowers.

492
00:16:54,943 --> 00:16:56,310
- So cute. / - Cute.

493
00:16:56,310 --> 00:16:57,777
- Cute. / - I love this place.

494
00:16:57,777 --> 00:16:59,677
It smells like tonic.

495
00:16:59,677 --> 00:17:00,977
(Smell of the herbal tonic)

496
00:17:00,977 --> 00:17:02,510
It's like adult spicy rice cakes.

497
00:17:02,510 --> 00:17:04,210
I like the taste of jujubes.

498
00:17:06,643 --> 00:17:08,243
- So pretty. / - Finally...

499
00:17:08,243 --> 00:17:09,310
- She's drinking. / - Is that wine?

500
00:17:09,310 --> 00:17:10,543
I've always wanted to try this.

501
00:17:10,543 --> 00:17:12,677
With friends...

502
00:17:15,543 --> 00:17:17,243
We haven't seen that dance in ages.

503
00:17:17,243 --> 00:17:19,610
It's different when the originals do it.

504
00:17:21,577 --> 00:17:24,410
(Yoojung's spring)

505
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:28,643
(Mina's spring)

506
00:17:28,643 --> 00:17:30,577
(Current time, 4:30 a.m.)

507
00:17:30,577 --> 00:17:32,143
- 4:30? / - 4:30 a.m.

508
00:17:32,143 --> 00:17:35,210
- Yes. / - We are at Yongsan Station.

509
00:17:35,210 --> 00:17:36,610
We're in Yongsan now.

510
00:17:36,610 --> 00:17:38,777
Yes, this is Yongsan Station.

511
00:17:38,777 --> 00:17:42,243
Don't you think we should visit

512
00:17:42,243 --> 00:17:43,810
many places in Suncheon?

513
00:17:43,810 --> 00:17:45,077
That's why

514
00:17:45,077 --> 00:17:46,777
we will get on the first train

515
00:17:46,777 --> 00:17:48,010
and get moving.

516
00:17:48,010 --> 00:17:48,543
Understood?

517
00:17:48,543 --> 00:17:50,477
- This way, we'll visit many places. / - Right, right.

518
00:17:50,477 --> 00:17:51,877
Yoojung said

519
00:17:51,877 --> 00:17:53,610
I need to trust her and follow her lead today.

520
00:17:53,610 --> 00:17:56,210
That's right. Let me handle today's itinerary.

521
00:17:56,210 --> 00:17:58,343
We'll take a good look around Suncheon

522
00:17:58,343 --> 00:17:59,710
and take a rest.

523
00:17:59,710 --> 00:18:00,443
Okay, okay.

524
00:18:00,443 --> 00:18:02,443
- Let's go. / - Let's go.

525
00:18:02,443 --> 00:18:03,510
Let's go.

526
00:18:05,077 --> 00:18:07,743
(They set out to Suncheon)

527
00:18:10,410 --> 00:18:11,377
What's this?

528
00:18:11,377 --> 00:18:12,143
Why?

529
00:18:12,143 --> 00:18:12,977
What's going on?

530
00:18:12,977 --> 00:18:14,343
What is this? Is this a train station?

531
00:18:14,343 --> 00:18:16,343
- You've only been to Seoul Station? / - Wait...

532
00:18:16,343 --> 00:18:17,243
I'd never been.

533
00:18:17,243 --> 00:18:18,743
- You've never even been to Seoul Station? / - No.

534
00:18:18,743 --> 00:18:21,610
Yoojung is fascinated by our station.

535
00:18:21,610 --> 00:18:23,677
What is this place?

536
00:18:23,677 --> 00:18:26,143
- I've never seen this before. / - This is Yongsan.

537
00:18:26,143 --> 00:18:28,310
- So many firsts for you. / - Yes.

538
00:18:30,643 --> 00:18:32,543
It feels so strange.

539
00:18:32,543 --> 00:18:33,210
Why?

540
00:18:34,477 --> 00:18:35,677
It's like...

541
00:18:35,677 --> 00:18:37,910
I still can't believe it.

542
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:42,277
We're really going on this trip.

543
00:18:42,277 --> 00:18:43,210
Unbelievable.

544
00:18:44,877 --> 00:18:47,010
We have an important matter on our hands.

545
00:18:47,010 --> 00:18:48,977
The much anticipated...

546
00:18:49,810 --> 00:18:51,577
Ta-da.

547
00:18:51,577 --> 00:18:53,577
Ta-da.

548
00:18:55,277 --> 00:18:56,610
Ta-da!

549
00:18:57,343 --> 00:19:00,310
We made these the other day.

550
00:19:00,310 --> 00:19:02,677
You must take those on trips these days.

551
00:19:02,677 --> 00:19:04,343
If you take a photo through those...

552
00:19:04,343 --> 00:19:06,110
- They turn out great. / - Right.

553
00:19:06,110 --> 00:19:07,977
It'd be great if you make one

554
00:19:07,977 --> 00:19:08,677
before going on your trip.

555
00:19:08,677 --> 00:19:10,777
When you take a photo with that at the beach,

556
00:19:10,777 --> 00:19:12,310
it looks so good.

557
00:19:13,443 --> 00:19:15,610
This is how they turned out.

558
00:19:17,043 --> 00:19:17,943
Isn't this pretty?

559
00:19:19,343 --> 00:19:20,610
Ta-da.

560
00:19:20,610 --> 00:19:21,610
So pretty.

561
00:19:22,477 --> 00:19:23,210
Then...

562
00:19:23,210 --> 00:19:25,243
Let's take this out...

563
00:19:25,243 --> 00:19:27,277
- Yeah. / - And take a photo here.

564
00:19:28,143 --> 00:19:29,243
Right here.

565
00:19:29,243 --> 00:19:30,577
This is the spot. This is it.

566
00:19:31,610 --> 00:19:32,477
This looks good.

567
00:19:37,177 --> 00:19:39,043
So it shows.

568
00:19:39,877 --> 00:19:43,377
(Toppers are the focus)

569
00:19:43,377 --> 00:19:46,977
(Yoojung sleeps on the train)

570
00:19:47,143 --> 00:19:48,977
(Yongsan Station, Suncheon Station)

571
00:19:48,977 --> 00:19:53,010
(2 hours and 40 minutes)

572
00:19:53,010 --> 00:19:57,010
(Suncheon Station, 7:50 a.m.)

573
00:19:58,943 --> 00:20:00,477
We've arrived at Suncheon Station.

574
00:20:00,477 --> 00:20:02,177
This is Suncheon!

575
00:20:02,743 --> 00:20:03,843
Was that your first time there?

576
00:20:03,843 --> 00:20:04,777
- Yes. / - Yes.

577
00:20:04,777 --> 00:20:05,743
My gosh.

578
00:20:06,443 --> 00:20:07,610
We have to do this thing.

579
00:20:07,610 --> 00:20:09,210
- What is it? / - A photo with the station name.

580
00:20:10,010 --> 00:20:12,177
We need to take a photo with the sign.

581
00:20:12,177 --> 00:20:14,177
- People take photos like that. / - Isn't that pretty?

582
00:20:17,777 --> 00:20:18,910
Suncheon.

583
00:20:18,910 --> 00:20:20,777
Suncheon.

584
00:20:22,277 --> 00:20:23,543
Where are we going now?

585
00:20:23,543 --> 00:20:25,943
- We will... / - You told me to follow your lead.

586
00:20:25,943 --> 00:20:29,343
After I.O.I, this is the first time...

587
00:20:29,343 --> 00:20:31,877
- We've gone anywhere together. / - That's right.

588
00:20:31,877 --> 00:20:34,277
Doesn't it feel like...

589
00:20:34,277 --> 00:20:36,977
- We've gone back to that time? / - Yes.

590
00:20:36,977 --> 00:20:40,010
To really travel back in time...

591
00:20:40,010 --> 00:20:40,810
Are we going?

592
00:20:40,810 --> 00:20:42,810
We will take the bus to travel back in time.

593
00:20:42,810 --> 00:20:44,543
- It must've been a great trip. / - That way.

594
00:20:44,543 --> 00:20:47,110
- Let's go. / - Were you in high school in I.O.I?

595
00:20:47,110 --> 00:20:47,677
- Yes. / - Yes.

596
00:20:47,677 --> 00:20:49,810
We first met when we were 17.

597
00:20:49,810 --> 00:20:51,010
Oh, my.

598
00:20:51,010 --> 00:20:53,077
Besides, you were so busy when you were in I.O.I.

599
00:20:53,077 --> 00:20:55,210
- You didn't have time to travel. / - That's so true.

600
00:20:55,210 --> 00:20:56,510
That's right.

601
00:20:59,510 --> 00:21:01,310
Even at this point,

602
00:21:01,310 --> 00:21:03,143
it kind of...

603
00:21:03,143 --> 00:21:04,410
Feels like...

604
00:21:04,410 --> 00:21:06,777
We're in a drama set.

605
00:21:06,777 --> 00:21:08,210
Is that the bus stop?

606
00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:10,143
I think this is it.

607
00:21:11,043 --> 00:21:13,043
Yes, this must be it.

608
00:21:13,043 --> 00:21:15,410
Here it is, drama set.

609
00:21:15,410 --> 00:21:16,610
Then from here...

610
00:21:16,610 --> 00:21:18,543
I bet it's been a while since you took the bus.

611
00:21:18,543 --> 00:21:20,377
- Yes. / - It's been a while.

612
00:21:20,377 --> 00:21:23,343
- Right? / - Walking around to celebrate us being 20...

613
00:21:23,343 --> 00:21:24,910
I think it'll be memorable.

614
00:21:24,910 --> 00:21:25,977
The bus is here.

615
00:21:28,310 --> 00:21:30,410
My gosh, the bus!

616
00:21:30,410 --> 00:21:33,843
- Ta-da. We'll take this bus. / - 77.

617
00:21:33,843 --> 00:21:35,077
Here we go.

618
00:21:35,077 --> 00:21:36,977
When we go to Gwangyang tomorrow,

619
00:21:36,977 --> 00:21:38,910
we will take the same bus.

620
00:21:38,910 --> 00:21:39,477
Is that so?

621
00:21:39,477 --> 00:21:41,177
Yes, we'll take the same bus.

622
00:21:42,477 --> 00:21:43,910
You can visit almost all of

623
00:21:43,910 --> 00:21:46,443
the tourist attractions with Bus 77.

624
00:21:46,443 --> 00:21:48,810
- We should remember that number. / - Yes.

625
00:21:50,543 --> 00:21:53,043
This slightly looks like Jeju-do.

626
00:21:53,043 --> 00:21:54,043
Really?

627
00:21:54,043 --> 00:21:55,977
Everything about Suncheon looks interesting to me.

628
00:21:58,710 --> 00:22:00,677
It's different taking the bus to go to school

629
00:22:00,677 --> 00:22:02,510
and taking the bus on a trip.

630
00:22:02,510 --> 00:22:03,343
You're right.

631
00:22:03,343 --> 00:22:04,377
Your faces look different.

632
00:22:06,043 --> 00:22:08,010
On days like this, even the weather's nice.

633
00:22:08,010 --> 00:22:09,243
Right.

634
00:22:09,243 --> 00:22:10,110
You're right.

635
00:22:15,910 --> 00:22:18,543
The dramas

636
00:22:18,543 --> 00:22:19,810
that were filmed here

637
00:22:19,810 --> 00:22:21,543
are all shown here...

638
00:22:21,543 --> 00:22:24,377
Like this.

639
00:22:24,377 --> 00:22:25,243
Amazing.

640
00:22:25,943 --> 00:22:27,210
"Bread, Love and Dreams".

641
00:22:28,143 --> 00:22:30,110
Of course, I know. I know Kim Takgu.

642
00:22:30,110 --> 00:22:31,910
- "Gangnam Blues." / - They filmed dramas here.

643
00:22:31,910 --> 00:22:35,010
- Many dramas were shot here. / - 47.

644
00:22:35,010 --> 00:22:36,277
"East of Eden."

645
00:22:37,343 --> 00:22:39,077
- We're here! / - I see murals.

646
00:22:44,643 --> 00:22:47,143
1970s, 1980s, 1960s.

647
00:22:47,143 --> 00:22:48,110
Divided into eras.

648
00:22:48,110 --> 00:22:49,710
This is so interesting.

649
00:22:49,710 --> 00:22:52,177
It's a TV-shaped entrance.

650
00:22:52,177 --> 00:22:53,643
Hello.

651
00:22:53,643 --> 00:22:55,310
Two tickets, please.

652
00:22:56,243 --> 00:22:58,177
- Thank you. / - Thank you.

653
00:22:58,177 --> 00:22:59,577
I'm going to attach this to my diary.

654
00:23:05,643 --> 00:23:07,910
It's a scene from the past.

655
00:23:07,910 --> 00:23:09,143
Restroom.

656
00:23:10,310 --> 00:23:11,977
This is Suncheon.

657
00:23:13,410 --> 00:23:14,077
Goosebumps.

658
00:23:15,243 --> 00:23:16,077
Goosebumps.

659
00:23:16,077 --> 00:23:17,043
Why?

660
00:23:17,043 --> 00:23:19,443
I saw that

661
00:23:19,443 --> 00:23:20,443
in "Lights and Shadows."

662
00:23:20,443 --> 00:23:22,443
- Really? / - That theater.

663
00:23:22,443 --> 00:23:24,243
- A domestic theater! / - That's right.

664
00:23:25,110 --> 00:23:27,277
- It was so fascinating. / - Yeah.

665
00:23:27,277 --> 00:23:28,677
It's that place.

666
00:23:28,677 --> 00:23:30,977
- So fascinating. / - It was really fascinating.

667
00:23:30,977 --> 00:23:32,377
When people come here,

668
00:23:32,377 --> 00:23:34,310
everyone rents out school uniforms.

669
00:23:34,310 --> 00:23:35,777
Boys and girls uniforms.

670
00:23:35,777 --> 00:23:37,110
Everyone does.

671
00:23:37,110 --> 00:23:38,577
We can wear them here?

672
00:23:38,577 --> 00:23:40,277
You must try that out.

673
00:23:40,277 --> 00:23:41,743
People must rent school uniforms.

674
00:23:41,743 --> 00:23:44,177
- Taking photos... / - You must enter that time.

675
00:23:44,177 --> 00:23:45,743
- So many. / - I really want to try it.

676
00:23:45,743 --> 00:23:48,043
Coming here with friends,

677
00:23:48,043 --> 00:23:50,143
wearing uniforms and eating lunch boxes.

678
00:23:50,910 --> 00:23:52,377
Experiencing these things.

679
00:23:52,377 --> 00:23:54,610
- Hello. / - Hello.

680
00:23:54,610 --> 00:23:55,810
No way.

681
00:23:55,810 --> 00:23:56,910
This is a school.

682
00:24:00,277 --> 00:24:01,210
Isn't this adorable?

683
00:24:01,210 --> 00:24:03,010
Those green desks!

684
00:24:03,010 --> 00:24:04,243
It was so interesting.

685
00:24:04,243 --> 00:24:06,910
I hate that wood.

686
00:24:06,910 --> 00:24:08,043
Right.

687
00:24:08,043 --> 00:24:08,843
You get all these splinters.

688
00:24:08,843 --> 00:24:10,043
That's right.

689
00:24:10,043 --> 00:24:12,010
If you touch the wrong spot. Right.

690
00:24:12,010 --> 00:24:14,177
If you see in movies...

691
00:24:14,177 --> 00:24:15,343
Right.

692
00:24:15,343 --> 00:24:18,510
The character in "Black Rubber Shoes" wears this.

693
00:24:18,510 --> 00:24:21,743
What kind of uniform is this?

694
00:24:23,910 --> 00:24:25,410
They have props.

695
00:24:25,410 --> 00:24:26,710
Student president.

696
00:24:26,710 --> 00:24:28,610
They had that there.

697
00:24:28,610 --> 00:24:29,377
Kang Daniel?

698
00:24:29,377 --> 00:24:30,443
- Why is that there? / - What's Kang Daniel?

699
00:24:30,443 --> 00:24:32,843
You can borrow name tags.

700
00:24:32,843 --> 00:24:34,343
It was there as an example.

701
00:24:36,143 --> 00:24:37,043
- Ta-da. / - Ta-da.

702
00:24:37,043 --> 00:24:38,443
They did this.

703
00:24:38,443 --> 00:24:39,943
That's so outdated.

704
00:24:39,943 --> 00:24:41,510
No, no. We have to own it.

705
00:24:41,510 --> 00:24:42,910
We must look confident.

706
00:24:42,910 --> 00:24:45,377
(Confident)

707
00:24:46,010 --> 00:24:47,943
Hey, you said we have to look confident!

708
00:24:47,943 --> 00:24:49,543
Hey, you said we have to look confident!

709
00:24:50,477 --> 00:24:51,943
(Cute)

710
00:24:53,543 --> 00:24:56,110
If you take photos in uniform here, they'll look great.

711
00:24:56,110 --> 00:24:58,377
- There were many spots for photos. / - Looks good.

712
00:24:58,377 --> 00:24:59,510
You can take those photos

713
00:24:59,510 --> 00:25:01,343
and compare them to your mom's.

714
00:25:02,677 --> 00:25:04,143
- You're right. / - Of course.

715
00:25:04,143 --> 00:25:05,543
Doesn't it feel like

716
00:25:05,543 --> 00:25:07,243
we're students of the old days?

717
00:25:07,243 --> 00:25:08,443
- What do you mean? / - It's so...

718
00:25:08,443 --> 00:25:11,843
Isn't this 1988?

719
00:25:12,810 --> 00:25:21,043
(Sunyang Cinema in 1988)

720
00:25:22,043 --> 00:25:24,677
That's right. I saw this theater in the drama.

721
00:25:24,677 --> 00:25:26,943
This theater showed up a lot in "Giant."

722
00:25:26,943 --> 00:25:27,810
And "Lights and Shadows."

723
00:25:27,810 --> 00:25:28,677
Ah!

724
00:25:28,677 --> 00:25:29,610
Right?

725
00:25:29,610 --> 00:25:30,643
You remember that, don't you?

726
00:25:30,643 --> 00:25:32,777
(Oops)

727
00:25:32,777 --> 00:25:35,177
(What is this?)

728
00:25:35,843 --> 00:25:37,410
We can now watch...

729
00:25:38,510 --> 00:25:39,710
Erotic movies.

730
00:25:39,710 --> 00:25:41,277
I'm so embarrassed.

731
00:25:42,477 --> 00:25:44,077
They were...

732
00:25:44,077 --> 00:25:46,677
They only had those type of movie posters.

733
00:25:46,677 --> 00:25:47,677
What is that?

734
00:25:47,677 --> 00:25:49,277
Adult movies...

735
00:25:49,277 --> 00:25:51,377
Why didn't they have things like "Rambo?"

736
00:25:51,377 --> 00:25:52,477
Should we go in?

737
00:25:55,143 --> 00:25:58,843
(Embarrassed )

738
00:25:59,277 --> 00:26:02,210
(We're 20 years old, we can watch all movies)

739
00:26:02,877 --> 00:26:04,610
Here...

740
00:26:04,610 --> 00:26:06,377
- Wow. / - Pretty photos.

741
00:26:07,310 --> 00:26:08,810
These photos will be memorable.

742
00:26:08,810 --> 00:26:11,577
- Later on. / - You take photos with your phones...

743
00:26:11,577 --> 00:26:14,010
And they print them on wooden frames.

744
00:26:14,010 --> 00:26:14,910
Just like from the old days?

745
00:26:14,910 --> 00:26:17,610
- A place that suits our uniforms. / - That suits...

746
00:26:17,610 --> 00:26:19,577
We should take a photo in such a place.

747
00:26:20,743 --> 00:26:24,043
(Poor hillside village in the 1970s)

748
00:26:25,677 --> 00:26:26,943
The weather was great that day.

749
00:26:26,943 --> 00:26:28,577
- This is it. / - You're right.

750
00:26:28,577 --> 00:26:29,810
No.

751
00:26:31,210 --> 00:26:32,277
No.

752
00:26:32,277 --> 00:26:33,777
Lean on me.

753
00:26:33,777 --> 00:26:35,810
Everyone took photos on their sides

754
00:26:35,810 --> 00:26:37,010
in the 1970s.

755
00:26:37,943 --> 00:26:40,477
- That was so nice. / - Great photo.

756
00:26:45,010 --> 00:26:46,043
I haven't looked yet.

757
00:26:46,043 --> 00:26:47,110
Me neither.

758
00:26:47,110 --> 00:26:48,677
- Let's look on the count of three. / - Okay.

759
00:26:48,677 --> 00:26:50,277
1, 2, 3.

760
00:26:52,310 --> 00:26:53,677
This one turned out great.

761
00:26:53,677 --> 00:26:55,310
This is awesome.

762
00:26:55,310 --> 00:26:57,543
It's like a movie.

763
00:26:57,543 --> 00:26:59,343
- Doesn't it look like it? / - This one's no joke.

764
00:26:59,343 --> 00:27:00,377
Thank you.

765
00:27:00,377 --> 00:27:02,177
- Bye. / - Thank you.

766
00:27:02,177 --> 00:27:04,943
- It's a photo of a lifetime. / - So pretty.

767
00:27:04,943 --> 00:27:05,610
You're right.

768
00:27:05,610 --> 00:27:07,043
When it comes to Battle Trip...

769
00:27:07,043 --> 00:27:08,777
You can't leave out food.

770
00:27:09,443 --> 00:27:11,310
You're known to be a picky eater.

771
00:27:11,310 --> 00:27:12,310
That's true.

772
00:27:12,310 --> 00:27:14,310
You can't eat a lot of food.

773
00:27:14,310 --> 00:27:16,177
- You can't eat all of them? / - No, I can't.

774
00:27:16,177 --> 00:27:17,543
You can't eat any of the dishes on the list?

775
00:27:18,277 --> 00:27:19,810
Something that suits your tastes.

776
00:27:19,810 --> 00:27:21,843
- Restaurant. / - I found a course.

777
00:27:21,843 --> 00:27:23,343
- Right, right. / - A course meal?

778
00:27:23,343 --> 00:27:24,377
Okay.

779
00:27:25,710 --> 00:27:27,843
(Drama set)

780
00:27:27,843 --> 00:27:28,610
(Suncheon eatery)

781
00:27:28,610 --> 00:27:31,177
(30 minutes by Bus 77)

782
00:27:33,577 --> 00:27:35,010
Traveling by bus...

783
00:27:35,010 --> 00:27:36,610
- You're dressed the same. / - The twin look?

784
00:27:36,610 --> 00:27:38,077
We kept going with the twin look.

785
00:27:38,077 --> 00:27:39,443
A trip to Suncheon is so...

786
00:27:39,443 --> 00:27:40,543
I feel like we can do everything here.

787
00:27:43,643 --> 00:27:45,477
So what are we eating?

788
00:27:45,477 --> 00:27:47,243
Today, we will

789
00:27:47,243 --> 00:27:50,610
eat the famous dish everyone must

790
00:27:50,610 --> 00:27:52,043
try in Suncheon.

791
00:27:52,043 --> 00:27:54,077
We'll eat spicy fishcake.

792
00:27:54,077 --> 00:27:54,943
My gosh.

793
00:27:55,643 --> 00:27:56,643
Spicy fishcake?

794
00:27:57,410 --> 00:27:58,443
Fishcake?

795
00:27:58,443 --> 00:27:59,877
Seriously...

796
00:27:59,877 --> 00:28:02,143
This is like asking a cat to hold on to a fish.

797
00:28:07,043 --> 00:28:07,843
Looks good.

798
00:28:07,843 --> 00:28:08,977
That looks so good.

799
00:28:08,977 --> 00:28:09,777
Amazing.

800
00:28:09,777 --> 00:28:10,610
- Hey. / - Amazing.

801
00:28:11,243 --> 00:28:12,277
What is it?

802
00:28:12,277 --> 00:28:13,977
This is...

803
00:28:13,977 --> 00:28:16,677
We have a place this in my neighborhood.

804
00:28:19,077 --> 00:28:20,710
Should we write something too?

805
00:28:20,710 --> 00:28:22,810
We love spicy rice cakes.

806
00:28:22,810 --> 00:28:25,010
- Right. / - It's lucky that it wasn't the busy hour.

807
00:28:25,010 --> 00:28:25,977
The students would go crazy.

808
00:28:25,977 --> 00:28:26,843
It'd be insane.

809
00:28:30,177 --> 00:28:32,077
It really looks cute.

810
00:28:32,077 --> 00:28:34,077
It'd be fun to go and look for that.

811
00:28:34,077 --> 00:28:35,777
At that restaurant.

812
00:28:35,777 --> 00:28:38,110
(They write for each other)

813
00:28:38,710 --> 00:28:40,410
Actually...

814
00:28:40,410 --> 00:28:42,243
Suncheon is famous for cockles.

815
00:28:42,243 --> 00:28:43,077
- Cockles? / - Yeah.

816
00:28:43,077 --> 00:28:44,143
She can't eat cockles.

817
00:28:44,777 --> 00:28:46,710
But cockles aren't in season now.

818
00:28:47,743 --> 00:28:48,810
So...

819
00:28:48,810 --> 00:28:50,977
We love fried foods, right?

820
00:28:50,977 --> 00:28:52,043
We love it.

821
00:28:52,043 --> 00:28:55,077
While we were promoting, we had spicy rice cakes...

822
00:28:55,077 --> 00:28:57,110
- Hey, hey, you're right. / - Yeah.

823
00:28:57,110 --> 00:28:59,110
We only had spicy rice cakes or cup rice

824
00:28:59,110 --> 00:29:01,110
in our green room.

825
00:29:01,110 --> 00:29:03,910
- Or chicken. / - We ordered it at the dorm.

826
00:29:03,910 --> 00:29:04,477
You're right.

827
00:29:04,477 --> 00:29:07,143
We ordered spicy rice cakes a lot.

828
00:29:10,143 --> 00:29:12,610
- Thank you. / - Thank you.

829
00:29:12,610 --> 00:29:14,010
This is how it's served.

830
00:29:14,010 --> 00:29:15,277
Hey, but for the price,

831
00:29:15,277 --> 00:29:16,377
the serving is huge.

832
00:29:16,377 --> 00:29:17,543
Do you cook it on the spot?

833
00:29:19,810 --> 00:29:21,443
I like it when there's more fishcake than rice cake.

834
00:29:21,443 --> 00:29:24,877
I recommend it for people who like fishcakes.

835
00:29:24,877 --> 00:29:26,243
- Thank you for the meal. / - Thank you for the meal.

836
00:29:27,077 --> 00:29:29,177
(I'll eat this up)

837
00:29:30,377 --> 00:29:32,743
(She's focused)

838
00:29:32,743 --> 00:29:33,577
(Blowing)

839
00:29:33,943 --> 00:29:34,810
(Blowing)

840
00:29:37,977 --> 00:29:39,310
I only blew lightly.

841
00:29:42,143 --> 00:29:43,643
(Slurping)

842
00:29:48,110 --> 00:29:49,210
This is so good.

843
00:29:50,577 --> 00:29:51,343
(Blowing)

844
00:29:51,643 --> 00:29:52,677
(Blowing)

845
00:29:52,810 --> 00:29:54,310
- See? See? / - I'm sorry.

846
00:29:54,310 --> 00:29:55,277
I'm sorry, Mina.

847
00:29:56,477 --> 00:29:57,710
This...

848
00:29:57,710 --> 00:29:59,477
I get why it's called spicy fishcakes.

849
00:29:59,477 --> 00:30:00,410
Is it spicy?

850
00:30:00,410 --> 00:30:03,510
Spicy rice cakes are normally sweet.

851
00:30:04,310 --> 00:30:05,410
It's...

852
00:30:05,410 --> 00:30:06,143
Spicy.

853
00:30:06,843 --> 00:30:07,743
It's spicy.

854
00:30:07,743 --> 00:30:08,443
Like really spicy seafood noodles.

855
00:30:08,443 --> 00:30:10,543
- Yes, it's like that. / - It's really spicy.

856
00:30:10,543 --> 00:30:12,177
Taste like really spicy noodles.

857
00:30:12,177 --> 00:30:13,210
Too spicy for Yoojung.

858
00:30:13,210 --> 00:30:15,443
She can't eat spicy food.

859
00:30:15,443 --> 00:30:16,743
It's like adult spicy rice cakes.

860
00:30:16,743 --> 00:30:18,177
Yoojung...

861
00:30:18,177 --> 00:30:20,110
She eats like a kid.

862
00:30:20,110 --> 00:30:21,243
- She's cute. / - Look at her face.

863
00:30:21,243 --> 00:30:22,610
I can't eat spicy food.

864
00:30:22,610 --> 00:30:24,343
I can't eat hot or spicy food.

865
00:30:25,343 --> 00:30:26,610
- It's exactly this. / - You're right.

866
00:30:26,610 --> 00:30:28,343
But I like spicy rice cakes.

867
00:30:28,977 --> 00:30:31,143
The portion is huge though.

868
00:30:32,310 --> 00:30:33,510
There are dumplings too.

869
00:30:33,510 --> 00:30:34,277
Yes.

870
00:30:34,277 --> 00:30:36,443
It was a generous serving.

871
00:30:37,810 --> 00:30:39,910
Try the fishcake. The fishcake.

872
00:30:39,910 --> 00:30:41,843
It's seasoned well because it's thin.

873
00:30:41,843 --> 00:30:43,510
I like that it's cut into

874
00:30:43,510 --> 00:30:44,577
bite-sized pieces.

875
00:30:45,310 --> 00:30:46,743
- Isn't it spicy? / - No.

876
00:30:47,843 --> 00:30:48,977
This is my type of food.

877
00:30:49,677 --> 00:30:50,677
That's good.

878
00:30:50,677 --> 00:30:52,377
- We already finished half of it. / - Looks so good.

879
00:30:52,377 --> 00:30:55,477
This is like volcano rice cakes.

880
00:30:55,477 --> 00:30:57,310
It's strong but...

881
00:30:57,310 --> 00:30:58,510
It's not heavy.

882
00:30:58,510 --> 00:31:00,810
- Isn't it light? / - It's not the spiciness that hurts.

883
00:31:00,810 --> 00:31:02,243
Isn't it light?

884
00:31:02,243 --> 00:31:04,977
(This is my kind of food)

885
00:31:08,077 --> 00:31:09,910
- Today, it's so... / - Mina eats so well.

886
00:31:09,910 --> 00:31:11,043
Mina.

887
00:31:15,810 --> 00:31:17,543
I can take small bites

888
00:31:17,543 --> 00:31:19,410
but I can't take big bites.

889
00:31:22,743 --> 00:31:23,910
- It looks... / - It looks delicious.

890
00:31:23,910 --> 00:31:25,877
How long has it been since you

891
00:31:25,877 --> 00:31:26,943
ate as much as you want?

892
00:31:26,943 --> 00:31:28,743
- It's been a while. / - Right?

893
00:31:28,743 --> 00:31:30,543
We’ve been promoting our albums these days.

894
00:31:30,543 --> 00:31:32,477
I see. You can't eat much then.

895
00:31:32,477 --> 00:31:36,343
(If it gets too spicy, a sip of drink to ease down)

896
00:31:39,010 --> 00:31:40,143
Let's turn off the stove.

897
00:31:40,143 --> 00:31:40,910
Shall we?

898
00:31:41,710 --> 00:31:43,077
We might end up scorching it.

899
00:31:43,077 --> 00:31:45,143
I was boiling it down so we can mix rice.

900
00:31:46,410 --> 00:31:47,843
You're a pro.

901
00:31:48,510 --> 00:31:49,277
The sauce is...

902
00:31:49,277 --> 00:31:51,843
We fried rice with the sauce.

903
00:31:52,643 --> 00:31:54,010
This is it.

904
00:31:54,010 --> 00:31:54,743
That's so...

905
00:31:54,743 --> 00:31:56,510
It was really delicious.

906
00:31:56,510 --> 00:31:58,543
Koreans always do this at the end of a meal.

907
00:31:58,543 --> 00:31:59,443
I need to do that to finish a meal.

908
00:31:59,443 --> 00:32:01,177
- That's how to end it. / - It's hot.

909
00:32:02,243 --> 00:32:03,143
It's really savory.

910
00:32:05,243 --> 00:32:08,177
I could immediately feel the aroma of the cheese.

911
00:32:08,177 --> 00:32:10,277
Woojin has fallen for the mixed rice.

912
00:32:11,243 --> 00:32:12,710
- You have to eat that. / - Right?

913
00:32:14,043 --> 00:32:15,310
Actually,

914
00:32:15,310 --> 00:32:16,910
I don't really like

915
00:32:16,910 --> 00:32:19,543
cheddar cheese because it could be

916
00:32:19,543 --> 00:32:20,977
a little too greasy.

917
00:32:21,577 --> 00:32:23,377
But this is not greasy at all. It's really savory.

918
00:32:23,977 --> 00:32:25,577
- It's like a cheese pancake. / - We finished it.

919
00:32:25,577 --> 00:32:26,710
It looks so delicious.

920
00:32:26,710 --> 00:32:29,110
When you go on a trip, you should eat a lot.

921
00:32:29,710 --> 00:32:30,610
Of course.

922
00:32:30,610 --> 00:32:32,310
(Mmm)

923
00:32:33,243 --> 00:32:34,043
It's delicious.

924
00:32:34,810 --> 00:32:35,677
What are we doing now?

925
00:32:36,577 --> 00:32:38,610
It's spring, so we're going to go see flowers.

926
00:32:39,077 --> 00:32:39,843
Let's go see flowers.

927
00:32:42,577 --> 00:32:44,077
It's okay.

928
00:32:44,077 --> 00:32:45,310
You can act like that at your age.

929
00:32:45,910 --> 00:32:47,410
We're going to a spring flower festival.

930
00:32:47,410 --> 00:32:48,543
The one you showed me before?

931
00:32:48,543 --> 00:32:49,910
- That... That... / - Yes, yes, that's right.

932
00:32:49,910 --> 00:32:50,910
100 million flowers.

933
00:32:50,910 --> 00:32:52,343
That's right.

934
00:32:52,343 --> 00:32:53,843
- There? / - We're going there.

935
00:32:53,843 --> 00:32:54,710
Shall we go?

936
00:32:56,277 --> 00:32:58,843
- Thank you for the food. / - Thank you for the food.

937
00:33:01,477 --> 00:33:02,643
(Suncheonman National Garden)

938
00:33:02,643 --> 00:33:04,043
(30 minutes on Bus 66)

939
00:33:04,043 --> 00:33:05,677
I'd like to see 100 million flowers.

940
00:33:06,343 --> 00:33:09,543
(Spring is when everything is in full bloom)

941
00:33:11,477 --> 00:33:12,843
This place is really huge.

942
00:33:13,743 --> 00:33:14,710
We're here.

943
00:33:14,710 --> 00:33:16,743
We're finally here.

944
00:33:16,743 --> 00:33:19,177
Well, this is where I've been

945
00:33:19,177 --> 00:33:22,177
looking forward the most.

946
00:33:22,943 --> 00:33:23,777
- Me. / - Me too.

947
00:33:23,777 --> 00:33:24,810
Right? Right?

948
00:33:24,810 --> 00:33:26,877
- Let's check it out first. / - Hurry, hurry.

949
00:33:26,877 --> 00:33:29,110
I think we should hurry to see a lot.

950
00:33:29,110 --> 00:33:30,710
Let's hurry and check it out.

951
00:33:30,710 --> 00:33:31,977
We have to walk around a lot.

952
00:33:31,977 --> 00:33:32,710
Right.

953
00:33:33,477 --> 00:33:35,010
I really wanted to look at flowers.

954
00:33:35,010 --> 00:33:37,343
(It's the size of 150 soccer stadiums)

955
00:33:37,343 --> 00:33:39,177
150 soccer stadiums?

956
00:33:39,177 --> 00:33:41,743
- Yes, it's really big. / - It's huge.

957
00:33:43,610 --> 00:33:44,877
Healing forest.

958
00:33:47,910 --> 00:33:49,310
By the way...

959
00:33:50,110 --> 00:33:52,643
I was wondering how 100 million flowers

960
00:33:52,643 --> 00:33:55,677
could fit in one place.

961
00:33:55,677 --> 00:33:56,910
But it's so huge.

962
00:33:56,910 --> 00:33:58,710
We should check the map.

963
00:33:58,710 --> 00:34:00,377
There's a lake too.

964
00:34:00,377 --> 00:34:02,777
1-hour course, 2-hour course.

965
00:34:02,777 --> 00:34:04,443
This one starts from East Gate to Rose Garden,

966
00:34:04,443 --> 00:34:05,843
Maze Garden, Lake Garden, German Garden,

967
00:34:05,843 --> 00:34:07,277
Dutch Garden...

968
00:34:07,910 --> 00:34:08,777
Let's take

969
00:34:08,777 --> 00:34:10,410
the Yoobom Nabom course.

970
00:34:10,410 --> 00:34:11,477
Okay.

971
00:34:11,477 --> 00:34:13,110
- Shall we go? / - Okay.

972
00:34:14,510 --> 00:34:16,710
You might not be able to see the whole thing in a day.

973
00:34:16,710 --> 00:34:18,810
Some people stay there overnight

974
00:34:18,810 --> 00:34:21,210
just to visit this place.

975
00:34:22,643 --> 00:34:24,977
There are a lot of people here.

976
00:34:25,710 --> 00:34:26,410
It's so...

977
00:34:26,410 --> 00:34:28,410
The tulips are so beautiful.

978
00:34:31,410 --> 00:34:34,643
(Flower path from the entrance)

979
00:34:34,643 --> 00:34:35,410
How pretty.

The tulips there...

986
00:34:49,010 --> 00:34:50,443
- Are just the beginning. / - Right.

987
00:34:50,443 --> 00:34:51,043
This is just the beginning?

988
00:34:51,043 --> 00:34:53,410
- This is just the beginning. / - Tulips are the start.

989
00:34:53,410 --> 00:34:55,810
How many flowers are there that this is just the start?

990
00:34:57,277 --> 00:34:58,777
That's how big it is.

991
00:34:58,777 --> 00:35:00,477
I can't believe I'm here.

992
00:35:04,577 --> 00:35:06,277
Amazing.

993
00:35:06,277 --> 00:35:08,077
- There's a lake as well? / - Yes.

994
00:35:08,943 --> 00:35:11,143
I can't believe there's such

995
00:35:11,143 --> 00:35:13,077
a big national garden.

996
00:35:13,077 --> 00:35:15,410
- It's so fascinating. / - That path is so beautiful.

997
00:35:15,410 --> 00:35:16,610
- Right. / - I can't believe such a place exists.

998
00:35:17,043 --> 00:35:18,843
It's really nice there.

999
00:35:20,810 --> 00:35:23,143
Many people said that we had

1000
00:35:23,143 --> 00:35:24,843
to visit the Dutch Garden,

1001
00:35:24,843 --> 00:35:28,110
so we added it to our course.

It looks so pretty.

1006
00:35:35,843 --> 00:35:36,877
It was really pretty.

1007
00:35:36,877 --> 00:35:39,010
It's a perfect place to take nice pictures.

1008
00:35:39,010 --> 00:35:40,643
Any random photo turns out nice.

1009
00:35:40,643 --> 00:35:41,977
It'd be great for photos.

1010
00:35:45,110 --> 00:35:46,643
This is so pretty!

1011
00:35:47,677 --> 00:35:49,510
This is too much.

1012
00:35:52,910 --> 00:35:56,810
I think this is my first time seeing tulips

1013
00:35:56,810 --> 00:35:57,910
since I was a little girl.

1014
00:35:57,910 --> 00:35:59,010
Right?

1015
00:35:59,010 --> 00:36:00,443
We don't often see tulips unless

1016
00:36:00,443 --> 00:36:02,343
you're in an amusement park.

1017
00:36:02,343 --> 00:36:03,343
It's so pretty.

1018
00:36:04,777 --> 00:36:05,743
Are we in Korea?

1019
00:36:08,077 --> 00:36:09,877
- So pretty. / - I love this color.

1020
00:36:09,877 --> 00:36:11,243
- This? / - I'm really into...

1021
00:36:11,243 --> 00:36:13,210
- Lavender these days. / - Lavender?

1022
00:36:16,643 --> 00:36:17,643
This?

1023
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:20,843
- Can I sit down? / - Yes.

1024
00:36:21,477 --> 00:36:23,777
1, 2, 3.

1025
00:36:24,910 --> 00:36:27,210
1, 2, 3.

1026
00:36:31,077 --> 00:36:34,043
- So pretty, right? / - That's so pretty.

1027
00:36:34,043 --> 00:36:35,677
It's all flowers in the back.

1028
00:36:35,677 --> 00:36:36,877
The flowers are so nice.

1029
00:36:36,877 --> 00:36:38,077
Seriously

1030
00:36:38,077 --> 00:36:38,610
Like this.

1031
00:36:38,610 --> 00:36:40,477
- Pretty. / - That's how it's done.

1032
00:36:40,477 --> 00:36:42,110
Is it a trend to close your eyes

1033
00:36:42,110 --> 00:36:44,110
when you take photos like this?

1034
00:36:44,110 --> 00:36:45,543
They do that these days.

1035
00:36:45,543 --> 00:36:46,377
Like this.

1036
00:36:46,377 --> 00:36:48,710
To make you seem fresh.

1037
00:36:48,710 --> 00:36:49,543
Fresh?

1038
00:36:49,543 --> 00:36:50,177
Right.

1039
00:36:50,177 --> 00:36:51,943
So it's a trending pose, right?

1040
00:36:51,943 --> 00:36:53,210
- Closing your eyes. / - Right.

1041
00:36:57,210 --> 00:36:59,443
Now, we're going to see canola flowers.

1042
00:37:00,377 --> 00:37:01,977
After seeing canola flowers,

1043
00:37:01,977 --> 00:37:03,243
we'll see animals.

1044
00:37:03,243 --> 00:37:05,810
There are so many things we need to see.

1045
00:37:05,810 --> 00:37:07,843
So first, let's go see canola flowers.

1046
00:37:07,843 --> 00:37:10,643
(Everything that is yellow is canola flowers)

1047
00:37:11,110 --> 00:37:13,677
(My goodness)

1048
00:37:13,677 --> 00:37:15,477
- Seriously. / - Amazing.

1049
00:37:15,477 --> 00:37:16,777
How many flowers are there?"

1050
00:37:16,777 --> 00:37:18,510
How many canola flowers are here?

1051
00:37:18,510 --> 00:37:20,410
This is just...

1052
00:37:20,410 --> 00:37:22,010
Like Jeju-do.

1053
00:37:22,010 --> 00:37:23,343
This is amazing.

1054
00:37:23,343 --> 00:37:25,177
- It's so pretty. / - Seriously, it is.

1055
00:37:25,177 --> 00:37:26,577
Make sure you come here.

1056
00:37:28,543 --> 00:37:29,543
It was so pretty.

1057
00:37:29,543 --> 00:37:30,510
I...

1058
00:37:30,510 --> 00:37:33,743
I wanted to take pictures of

1059
00:37:33,743 --> 00:37:35,543
the good memories here,

1060
00:37:35,543 --> 00:37:37,277
so I brought soap bubbles.

1061
00:37:37,977 --> 00:37:40,377
- You brought these for pictures? / - Yes.

1062
00:37:40,377 --> 00:37:41,677
Will it work?

1063
00:37:44,410 --> 00:37:45,577
But it should be windy...

1064
00:37:45,577 --> 00:37:46,777
But it should be windy...

1065
00:37:46,777 --> 00:37:47,877
You need a lot of wind...

1066
00:37:47,877 --> 00:37:48,477
- Huh? / - Goodness.

1067
00:37:49,910 --> 00:37:51,077
They'll fly out now.

1068
00:37:55,243 --> 00:37:56,077
So pretty.

1069
00:37:56,077 --> 00:37:57,477
- That's like... / - I thought it was photo-shopped.

1070
00:37:57,477 --> 00:37:58,710
They look like manga characters.

1071
00:37:58,710 --> 00:38:00,943
Here we go.

1072
00:38:00,943 --> 00:38:03,677
- God? / - Ready...

1073
00:38:06,043 --> 00:38:07,843
(Swing)

1074
00:38:08,510 --> 00:38:09,610
- Hey! / - Did it come out okay?

1075
00:38:09,610 --> 00:38:11,677
- Did we get a good one? / - I think I did.

1076
00:38:12,477 --> 00:38:13,543
Oh, wow.

1077
00:38:13,543 --> 00:38:15,477
- That was really fascinating. / - That was good, right?

1078
00:38:15,477 --> 00:38:16,510
I think it is.

1079
00:38:21,243 --> 00:38:23,343
How did you get the slow-mo right here?

1080
00:38:23,343 --> 00:38:24,477
Right?

1081
00:38:24,477 --> 00:38:25,543
That's awesome.

1082
00:38:26,277 --> 00:38:27,177
- Good job. / - Please pat my head.

1083
00:38:27,177 --> 00:38:28,943
- Good job, good job. / - I did so well.

1084
00:38:28,943 --> 00:38:30,110
Right?

1085
00:38:30,110 --> 00:38:31,543
Let me take a video of you this time.

1086
00:38:36,543 --> 00:38:37,377
Cue.

1087
00:38:40,010 --> 00:38:41,177
- That's a good one. / - I can tell it's good.

1088
00:38:41,177 --> 00:38:41,977
- It turned out well. / - It did.

1089
00:38:41,977 --> 00:38:43,077
- She smiled. / - She did well.

1090
00:38:43,077 --> 00:38:44,143
She smiled.

1091
00:38:44,143 --> 00:38:45,643
It was good when she smiled.

1092
00:38:45,643 --> 00:38:47,243
This is where it starts.

1093
00:38:50,477 --> 00:38:52,210
This is how it turns out. Isn't it pretty?

1094
00:38:53,143 --> 00:38:55,577
Then the bubbles fly out.

1095
00:38:55,577 --> 00:38:57,577
You did well too.

1096
00:38:57,577 --> 00:38:59,777
- Hey. / - I know how it works now.

1097
00:38:59,777 --> 00:39:01,010
- Nice. / - Okay, okay.

1098
00:39:01,010 --> 00:39:02,310
- Then... / - Yeah?

1099
00:39:02,310 --> 00:39:05,277
Let's go see the flamingoes you wanted to see.

1100
00:39:05,277 --> 00:39:06,210
Flamingoes!

1101
00:39:06,210 --> 00:39:07,943
I heard there are other animals as well.

1102
00:39:07,943 --> 00:39:09,110
Let's go see animals.

1103
00:39:09,110 --> 00:39:10,343
Let's hurry.

1104
00:39:10,343 --> 00:39:12,310
- Let's go! / - Go!

1105
00:39:14,377 --> 00:39:16,477
- I want to see. / - How do you feel right now?

1106
00:39:16,477 --> 00:39:17,777
My heart is racing!

1107
00:39:18,877 --> 00:39:21,810
- This place is really nice. / - It is.

1108
00:39:24,543 --> 00:39:25,477
- Wow. / - Wow.

1109
00:39:27,677 --> 00:39:30,643
The first time in my 20 years of life seeing flamingoes.

1110
00:39:30,643 --> 00:39:32,043
Unbelievable.

1111
00:39:32,743 --> 00:39:35,010
It's like they're wearing stockings.

1112
00:39:35,743 --> 00:39:37,443
Look at their bodies.

1113
00:39:37,810 --> 00:39:39,977
They're forming a heart.

1114
00:39:39,977 --> 00:39:41,310
I wish I could touch them.

1115
00:39:41,310 --> 00:39:43,610
Two flamingoes make a shape of heart together.

1116
00:39:43,610 --> 00:39:45,810
They can be standing with only one leg.

1117
00:39:46,710 --> 00:39:48,810
Yeah. Behind the one that's sleeping.

1118
00:39:48,810 --> 00:39:50,010
You're right.

1119
00:39:50,777 --> 00:39:51,943
Amazing.

1120
00:39:51,943 --> 00:39:53,710
They have such thin legs.

1121
00:39:53,710 --> 00:39:56,910
It's really interesting that they sleep on one leg.

1122
00:39:56,910 --> 00:39:58,477
They hide the other leg.

1123
00:39:59,010 --> 00:40:00,177
Look.

1124
00:40:03,510 --> 00:40:05,210
This is so fascinating.

1125
00:40:05,210 --> 00:40:06,943
- Everything's a first. / - Right.

1126
00:40:06,943 --> 00:40:08,677
- Seeing flamingoes for the first time. / - All firsts.

1127
00:40:08,677 --> 00:40:11,343
- First time in the Dutch Garden. / - First trip.

1128
00:40:11,343 --> 00:40:12,277
There's more inside?

1129
00:40:12,277 --> 00:40:13,877
Yes, in that building over there,

1130
00:40:13,877 --> 00:40:15,543
there are other animals.

1131
00:40:16,477 --> 00:40:17,810
Bye, guys.

1132
00:40:18,577 --> 00:40:20,077
We're leaving.

1133
00:40:20,077 --> 00:40:22,377
- They're very flexible. / - They are.

1134
00:40:22,377 --> 00:40:24,510
They can bend like this.

1135
00:40:27,677 --> 00:40:29,843
- What are you doing? / - She's good at that.

1136
00:40:30,410 --> 00:40:32,543
She's good at that.

1137
00:40:32,543 --> 00:40:34,310
- Good at bending her body. / - Yeah.

1138
00:40:35,810 --> 00:40:38,777
At times like this, you just have to move along.

1139
00:40:40,443 --> 00:40:41,877
I'm not going to respond.

1140
00:40:42,743 --> 00:40:45,210
(The next friends after the flamingo are)

1141
00:40:45,210 --> 00:40:47,577
- Prairie dogs? / - Oh, my.

1142
00:40:48,010 --> 00:40:49,710
Oh, they're so cute.

1143
00:40:49,710 --> 00:40:52,443
- So cute. / - Aren't they too cute?

1144
00:40:52,443 --> 00:40:53,543
So cute.

1145
00:40:53,543 --> 00:40:56,477
Do you want to be on Battle Trip?

1146
00:40:56,477 --> 00:40:57,943
They eat a lot.

1147
00:41:00,077 --> 00:41:01,810
What is that? They make it look so good.

1148
00:41:01,810 --> 00:41:02,577
I know.

1149
00:41:02,577 --> 00:41:04,143
- They were so cute. / - Eating so well.

1150
00:41:04,777 --> 00:41:06,477
- Goodness, fennec foxes. / - Fennec fox!

1151
00:41:06,477 --> 00:41:08,877
- They're so pretty. / - Aren't they pretty?

1152
00:41:12,243 --> 00:41:13,843
I want to raise them.

1153
00:41:15,510 --> 00:41:17,710
Oh, my. They're so cute.

1154
00:41:18,243 --> 00:41:20,977
People say I look like a fennec fox.

1155
00:41:20,977 --> 00:41:22,943
- That's right. / - You do.

1156
00:41:23,743 --> 00:41:25,943
- You look like one. / - You like alike.

1157
00:41:26,543 --> 00:41:27,277
So cute.

1158
00:41:27,577 --> 00:41:29,043
They're so cute.

1159
00:41:30,610 --> 00:41:31,777
- Meerkats! / - Seriously.

1160
00:41:31,777 --> 00:41:34,077
It was so amazing. They were standing up like this.

1161
00:41:34,077 --> 00:41:37,143
They're on the lookout

1162
00:41:37,143 --> 00:41:39,377
for large predators.

1163
00:41:39,377 --> 00:41:42,143
That's why they stand on their feet and look around.

1164
00:41:42,677 --> 00:41:44,377
Please stand for us.

1165
00:41:45,077 --> 00:41:46,977
- Just once. / - That's what I'm thinking too.

1166
00:41:46,977 --> 00:41:48,277
They want to take photos.

1167
00:41:48,710 --> 00:41:49,710
- Zoom. / - Just once.

1168
00:41:49,710 --> 00:41:50,810
- Please just once. / - But they...

1169
00:41:50,810 --> 00:41:51,877
Do it just once.

1170
00:41:52,643 --> 00:41:54,543
They must be going inside.

1171
00:41:55,277 --> 00:41:56,910
We wanted to take that so bad.

1172
00:41:56,910 --> 00:41:57,877
Did you wait for ages?

1173
00:41:58,743 --> 00:41:59,677
Like this...

1174
00:41:59,677 --> 00:42:01,477
No, like this.

1175
00:42:04,410 --> 00:42:07,677
Let's walk and then do this.

1176
00:42:07,677 --> 00:42:08,610
Got it?

1177
00:42:09,410 --> 00:42:12,110
Walk and 1, 2, 3.

1178
00:42:12,543 --> 00:42:14,277
- That's what happened? / - What's going on?

1179
00:42:14,810 --> 00:42:16,410
Cute!

1180
00:42:16,410 --> 00:42:17,610
How pretty.

1181
00:42:17,610 --> 00:42:19,043
Zoom.

1182
00:42:19,943 --> 00:42:21,277
They actually gathered.

1183
00:42:21,277 --> 00:42:23,477
- Oh, my. / - So cute!

1184
00:42:24,877 --> 00:42:25,877
It was fascinating...

1185
00:42:25,877 --> 00:42:28,210
- That they actually stood up. / - Wait a minute.

1186
00:42:28,777 --> 00:42:30,310
How did you call them?

1187
00:42:30,310 --> 00:42:31,410
It was so amazing.

1188
00:42:31,410 --> 00:42:33,010
They must've been aware.

1189
00:42:33,010 --> 00:42:34,677
Try it when you go there.

1190
00:42:34,677 --> 00:42:36,577
It might work.

1191
00:42:36,577 --> 00:42:38,177
So cute.

1192
00:42:38,177 --> 00:42:40,977
They know how to act on TV.

1193
00:42:41,443 --> 00:42:42,477
Look at that.

1194
00:42:42,477 --> 00:42:44,877
They actually put their hands like that.

1195
00:42:44,877 --> 00:42:46,077
- So cute. / - They're so cute.

1196
00:42:46,077 --> 00:42:47,310
Their noses are red.

1197
00:42:48,677 --> 00:42:50,710
Are they trying to pretend to be bigger than us?

1198
00:42:50,710 --> 00:42:53,510
(I'm not going to lose)

1199
00:42:53,510 --> 00:42:54,943
I'm so happy.

1200
00:42:54,943 --> 00:42:57,177
I become happy when I see cute animals.

1201
00:42:57,177 --> 00:42:58,410
Thank you.

1202
00:42:58,410 --> 00:42:59,810
Bye.

1203
00:42:59,810 --> 00:43:01,510
- Bye. / - Farewell.

1204
00:43:02,177 --> 00:43:04,843
1, 2, 3. Step, step, step.

1205
00:43:04,843 --> 00:43:06,643
Are you a meerkat?

1206
00:43:06,643 --> 00:43:08,910
- Cute. / - They're so cute.

1207
00:43:12,110 --> 00:43:16,777
From Suncheon to Gwangyang...

1208
00:43:16,777 --> 00:43:19,010
We'll have to sleep a night, right?

1209
00:43:19,010 --> 00:43:21,043
- Right. / - We have to sleep.

1210
00:43:21,043 --> 00:43:23,743
- We do. / - At a guest house.

1211
00:43:23,743 --> 00:43:26,277
That sounds good.

1212
00:43:26,277 --> 00:43:29,543
I didn't know this was a guest house.

1213
00:43:29,710 --> 00:43:32,443
(Suncheonman National Garden to guest house)

1214
00:43:33,110 --> 00:43:36,510
(Automatic reflex)

1215
00:43:36,743 --> 00:43:38,610
- Let's go this way. / - Here it is.

1216
00:43:38,610 --> 00:43:40,943
The guest house. Shall we go inside?

1217
00:43:40,943 --> 00:43:43,010
- Let's hurry. / - Let's go.

1218
00:43:44,077 --> 00:43:45,910
(A place to rest for a short time today)

1219
00:43:45,910 --> 00:43:48,810
- Hello. / - Hello.

1220
00:43:48,810 --> 00:43:52,243
(Guest house, double room for $50)

1221
00:43:52,977 --> 00:43:55,943
(They enter the guest house)

1222
00:43:55,943 --> 00:43:57,610
It smells so nice.

1223
00:43:58,710 --> 00:44:00,143
So nice.

1224
00:44:00,877 --> 00:44:04,077
- $50 for 2 people is cheap. / - Yes.

1225
00:44:04,077 --> 00:44:05,777
- This bed. / - Yeah.

1226
00:44:05,777 --> 00:44:09,743
Isn't it similar to the ones in the I.O.I dorm?

1227
00:44:09,743 --> 00:44:12,543
- These rails? / - Yeah, the rails.

1228
00:44:12,543 --> 00:44:14,110
- But this place is better, right? / - Yeah.

1229
00:44:15,177 --> 00:44:15,910
You know why?

1230
00:44:15,910 --> 00:44:18,443
- It's two single beds here. / - Yeah.

1231
00:44:19,343 --> 00:44:21,443
It's good to sleep there together and make memories.

1232
00:44:21,443 --> 00:44:22,510
- You can talk and sleep. / - It's so good.

1233
00:44:22,510 --> 00:44:25,177
It reminded of us of the past.

1234
00:44:25,177 --> 00:44:27,010
True.

1235
00:44:31,010 --> 00:44:32,310
Don't you love that time?

1236
00:44:32,310 --> 00:44:34,910
- Right before you fall asleep and talking. / - Yes.

1237
00:44:37,310 --> 00:44:38,777
What are you thinking about?

1238
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:43,143
I'm just... Sad.

1239
00:44:43,143 --> 00:44:44,643
That this will end tomorrow.

1240
00:44:44,643 --> 00:44:48,577
I've always wanted to travel

1241
00:44:48,577 --> 00:44:51,877
without my parents and I'm glad that...

1242
00:44:51,877 --> 00:44:54,843
- I'm doing this with you. / - Right?

1243
00:44:54,843 --> 00:44:56,977
That's what made it better.

1244
00:44:56,977 --> 00:45:00,243
We wore school uniforms and took photos.

1245
00:45:00,243 --> 00:45:03,010
- We also ate vintage snacks. / - That's right.

1246
00:45:03,010 --> 00:45:05,343
Being able to travel with

1247
00:45:05,343 --> 00:45:07,177
just you and me was so good.

1248
00:45:07,177 --> 00:45:11,210
I realized we received so much love back then.

1249
00:45:11,210 --> 00:45:13,277
I feel like I'm experiencing that again.

1250
00:45:13,277 --> 00:45:14,877
That's such a classic dance.

1251
00:45:14,877 --> 00:45:17,777
So many people cheered for us.

1252
00:45:17,777 --> 00:45:20,743
I feel so thankful for that.

1253
00:45:21,943 --> 00:45:26,943
(Memories more precious because we can't go back)

1254
00:45:27,710 --> 00:45:30,177
We have to get up early and have the breakfast buffet.

1255
00:45:30,177 --> 00:45:31,877
That's right.

1256
00:45:32,310 --> 00:45:34,410
Whatever you've prepared...

1257
00:45:34,410 --> 00:45:37,810
- Just trust me. / - I'll just follow that course.

1258
00:45:37,810 --> 00:45:40,277
Sounds good.

1259
00:45:40,277 --> 00:45:41,710
Let's hurry up and sleep.

1260
00:45:41,710 --> 00:45:44,710
- There's lots to eat tomorrow. / - Let's sleep.

1261
00:45:44,710 --> 00:45:46,943
- "There's lots to eat tomorrow." / - Turning the light off.

1262
00:45:46,943 --> 00:45:48,143
They're so cute.

1263
00:45:49,077 --> 00:45:51,243
I didn't tell you the highlight.

1264
00:45:51,243 --> 00:45:53,477
- We're going to eat Korean beef. / - What?

1265
00:45:53,477 --> 00:45:56,210
- Korean beef? / - That's why we have to sleep now.

1266
00:45:56,210 --> 00:45:57,543
I'm so excited.

1267
00:45:58,210 --> 00:45:59,310

00:53:42,010 --> 00:53:45,443
- It's delicious. / - It's so delicious, isn't it?

1443
00:53:45,443 --> 00:53:48,110
Try the meat fresh from the grill.

1444
00:53:48,110 --> 00:53:49,543
Try the meat.

1445
00:53:52,910 --> 00:53:54,710
(It's so hot)

1446
00:53:55,677 --> 00:53:57,943
- She's so funny. / - Look at her face.

1447
00:53:57,943 --> 00:53:58,477
It tastes so good.

1448
00:53:58,477 --> 00:54:01,243
You have to eat it fresh from the grill.

1449
00:54:01,243 --> 00:54:02,110
That's right.

1450
00:54:02,110 --> 00:54:04,343
You shouldn't let it rest on the plate.

1451
00:54:04,343 --> 00:54:06,543
You have to bring the meat straight from the grill.

1452
00:54:06,543 --> 00:54:08,243
- You shouldn't use a plate? / - You have to eat quick.

1453
00:54:08,243 --> 00:54:09,910
- As if you're fishing. / - That's right.

1454
00:54:09,910 --> 00:54:11,910
Woojin, are you convinced?

1455
00:54:11,910 --> 00:54:13,110
I'm kind of jealous.

1456
00:54:13,110 --> 00:54:14,877
It looks so delicious.

1457
00:54:14,877 --> 00:54:15,843
That's...

1458
00:54:17,710 --> 00:54:22,677
(They're enjoying the really hot food)

1459
00:54:23,377 --> 00:54:26,310
This is amazing.

1460
00:54:26,310 --> 00:54:27,443
It's different.

1461
00:54:27,443 --> 00:54:31,310
- This is why we came here. / - Right.

1462
00:54:31,310 --> 00:54:34,110
This is so... If you didn't eat this,

1463
00:54:34,110 --> 00:54:36,877
you shouldn't say you've been to Suncheon,

1464
00:54:36,877 --> 00:54:38,443
Gwangyang.

1465
00:54:38,443 --> 00:54:40,110
You must try this here. Okay?

1466
00:54:41,010 --> 00:54:42,577
This is incredible.

1467
00:54:42,577 --> 00:54:44,510
I don't think I will eat any other bulgogi from now on.

1468
00:54:45,210 --> 00:54:48,177
It's so delicious.

1469
00:54:48,177 --> 00:54:51,177
I think Yoojung can be a great actress too.

1470
00:54:51,177 --> 00:54:53,877
- So many faces. / - Such a variety of expressions.

1471
00:54:53,877 --> 00:54:56,143
They eat so well.

1472
00:54:56,143 --> 00:55:01,310
(They keep eating)

1473
00:55:04,410 --> 00:55:06,810
(They finished the food)

1474
00:55:06,810 --> 00:55:08,843
We'd like to order 2 more portions of meat.

1475
00:55:08,843 --> 00:55:09,977
That's it.

1476
00:55:09,977 --> 00:55:12,077
- They need to eat more. / - More plums too.

1477
00:55:12,077 --> 00:55:13,810
- Thank you. / - You need to get more.

1478
00:55:15,610 --> 00:55:17,143
Thank you.

1479
00:55:17,143 --> 00:55:19,910
- Shall we begin? / - Shall we begin?

1480
00:55:19,910 --> 00:55:21,943
- Actually... / - Is this a beginning?

1481
00:55:28,177 --> 00:55:29,277
(I'm done)

1482
00:55:29,277 --> 00:55:32,710
(I'm just getting started)

1483
00:55:33,777 --> 00:55:36,710
(Even when Yoojung left, Mina kept eating)

1484
00:55:36,710 --> 00:55:38,810
I want to go to Suncheon.

1485
00:55:38,810 --> 00:55:40,177
- For the bulgogi? / - Yes.

1486
00:55:41,410 --> 00:55:43,277
- Gwangyang. / - You said you wanted to ride bikes.

1487
00:55:43,277 --> 00:55:43,943
Right.

1488
00:55:43,943 --> 00:55:45,910
How about I teach you?

1489
00:55:45,910 --> 00:55:47,710
I've learned before

1490
00:55:47,710 --> 00:55:50,110
so I can ride it.

1491
00:55:50,110 --> 00:55:52,043
But I can only go straight.

1492
00:55:52,043 --> 00:55:53,177
Let me teach you.

1493
00:55:53,177 --> 00:55:55,010
Where can we ride bicycles?

1494
00:55:55,010 --> 00:55:57,443
Near Seocheon Riverside and Seomjin River.

1495
00:55:57,443 --> 00:55:59,477
- There are a lot of canola flowers. / - Canola flowers.

1496
00:55:59,477 --> 00:56:01,877
It's covered with the flowers there.

1497
00:56:01,877 --> 00:56:03,910
- All covered. / - Really?

1498
00:56:05,377 --> 00:56:07,243
We have to ride bikes now.

1499
00:56:07,710 --> 00:56:10,010
I'm so happy.

1500
00:56:10,010 --> 00:56:13,110
Do many people ride bicycles at Seocheon Riverside?

1501
00:56:13,110 --> 00:56:14,377
I think so.

1502
00:56:15,310 --> 00:56:16,943
- It's right next to where you were. / - Yes.

1503
00:56:16,943 --> 00:56:19,177
- That looks nice. / - Perfect course.

1504
00:56:19,177 --> 00:56:22,310
- You eat bulgogi then... / - You don't get that in Seoul.

1505
00:56:22,310 --> 00:56:23,410
- Exactly. / - This is Seocheon Riverside.

1506
00:56:23,410 --> 00:56:25,077
- Seoul is too artificial. / - Really?

1507
00:56:25,077 --> 00:56:26,343
- It's so pretty here, isn't it? / - Yeah.

1508
00:56:26,343 --> 00:56:27,377
The flowers are beautiful here.

1509
00:56:27,377 --> 00:56:30,277
Doesn't it make you feel good...

1510
00:56:30,277 --> 00:56:33,343
- To see the open view here? / - Right.

1511
00:56:33,343 --> 00:56:35,877
Just watching the river flow makes me feel good.

1512
00:56:37,010 --> 00:56:40,577
They're all cherry trees but no blossoms.

1513
00:56:40,577 --> 00:56:43,277
This place must be beautiful with cherry blossoms.

1514
00:56:43,277 --> 00:56:45,343
- It must be really beautiful. / - Right?

1515
00:56:45,343 --> 00:56:49,210
This place must be colorful all the time.

1516
00:56:49,210 --> 00:56:52,077
I love the colors here.

1517
00:56:57,277 --> 00:56:58,710
Riding a bicycle here must be nice for sure,

1518
00:56:58,710 --> 00:57:01,077
but walking must be nice as well.

1519
00:57:01,877 --> 00:57:05,377
(They play with each other)

1520
00:57:07,077 --> 00:57:08,977
Now let's go ride bicycles.

1521
00:57:09,743 --> 00:57:11,777
This is so nice.

1522
00:57:13,943 --> 00:57:15,743
Hello.

1523
00:57:15,743 --> 00:57:18,543
We'd like to rent bicycles.

1524
00:57:20,543 --> 00:57:21,977
From April 6th...

1525
00:57:21,977 --> 00:57:24,643
You can rent bicycles for free

1526
00:57:24,643 --> 00:57:26,010
in Gwangyang.

1527
00:57:26,010 --> 00:57:27,643
- Really? / - Yes.

1528
00:57:27,643 --> 00:57:29,843
If it's free, you should ride it.

1529
00:57:29,843 --> 00:57:31,743
They just started this service.

1530
00:57:34,243 --> 00:57:36,743
The weather is great today. It's so sunny.

1531
00:57:37,810 --> 00:57:40,177
- Let's go! / - Let's go!

1532
00:57:41,810 --> 00:57:43,577
Hey, Mina.

1533
00:57:44,077 --> 00:57:45,143
There are only...

1534
00:57:45,910 --> 00:57:47,277
This many canola flowers.

1535
00:57:47,743 --> 00:57:51,977
That road is supposed to be covered with flowers...

1536
00:57:52,943 --> 00:57:54,577
But we were there too early.

1537
00:57:54,577 --> 00:57:55,643
(It wasn't like this when I looked it up online)

1538
00:57:56,777 --> 00:57:58,043
It's supposed to look like this.

1539
00:57:58,043 --> 00:57:59,110
Yes.

1540
00:57:59,110 --> 00:58:01,410
There might be more canola flowers by now.

1541
00:58:01,410 --> 00:58:05,377
Yes, by now, it'll be in full bloom.

1542
00:58:05,677 --> 00:58:08,010
It's okay. We can enjoy this subtle beauty.

1543
00:58:08,010 --> 00:58:09,310
You're right.

1544
00:58:09,310 --> 00:58:11,210
"Subtle beauty."

1545
00:58:11,210 --> 00:58:13,043
She's right. There's subtle beauty.

1546
00:58:13,043 --> 00:58:15,343
As you push the pedal, put the other foot on the pedal.

1547
00:58:17,343 --> 00:58:18,443
You're good.

1548
00:58:20,977 --> 00:58:22,377
You're good.

1549
00:58:24,210 --> 00:58:25,877
I can do this.

1550
00:58:25,877 --> 00:58:27,843
Okay. Come here.

1551
00:58:28,943 --> 00:58:29,843
How do I?

1552
00:58:32,777 --> 00:58:34,277
Turn around.

1553
00:58:35,310 --> 00:58:36,410
Be careful.

1554
00:58:36,977 --> 00:58:38,143
Be careful.

1555
00:58:39,277 --> 00:58:41,710
She can't turn corners.

1556
00:58:42,110 --> 00:58:44,843
(You can just turn corners with your feet)

1557
00:58:45,443 --> 00:58:48,010
Actually, I can't turn corners either.

1558
00:58:48,510 --> 00:58:49,510
What the?

1559
00:58:50,277 --> 00:58:52,143
You two are a great team.

1560
00:58:57,010 --> 00:58:59,243
(They're excited)

1561
00:58:59,677 --> 00:59:01,243
Mina, I love this.

1562
00:59:02,210 --> 00:59:05,210
Mom, dad, I'm riding a bicycle.

1563
00:59:07,410 --> 00:59:09,110
This is nice.

1564
00:59:11,043 --> 00:59:13,310
The weather is so nice, isn't it?

1565
00:59:14,310 --> 00:59:16,177
It would've been nice if there were canola flowers too.

1566
00:59:16,177 --> 00:59:18,543
- It'd be so beautiful with the flowers. / - Right?

1567
00:59:18,543 --> 00:59:21,077
I'm sure they'll make it look like it with CG.

1568
00:59:21,077 --> 00:59:23,710
Canola flowers!

1569
00:59:24,343 --> 00:59:26,977
(Yoojung and Mina ride along the flower path)

1570
00:59:27,743 --> 00:59:30,110
(Mina rides the bicycle with only one hand)

1571
00:59:31,410 --> 00:59:32,410
I want to do that too!

1572
00:59:32,410 --> 00:59:33,643
No, I can't.

1573
00:59:35,643 --> 00:59:37,810
Choi Yoojung, you're a fool.

1574
00:59:38,243 --> 00:59:40,477
Kang Mina, you're a fool.

1575
00:59:46,210 --> 00:59:50,143
(Although there are no flowers, they enjoy the ride)

1576
00:59:50,143 --> 00:59:51,110
How was it?

1577
00:59:51,110 --> 00:59:54,543
Although there were no flowers, it was very nice

1578
00:59:54,543 --> 00:59:55,910
with the cool breeze and everything.

1579
00:59:55,910 --> 00:59:57,943
The weather makes the ride even more enjoyable.

1580
00:59:57,943 --> 01:00:00,410
- Let's go eat plum blossom macarons. / - Okay.

1581
01:00:00,410 --> 01:00:01,577
Let's go.

1582
01:00:01,577 --> 01:00:02,210
Macaroons?

1583
01:00:02,210 --> 01:00:03,810
- Plum blossom macarons? / - Yes.

1584
01:00:03,810 --> 01:00:06,743
I heard Gwangyang is famous for plum blossoms.

1585
01:00:06,743 --> 01:00:08,243
But around the time we visit the city,

1586
01:00:08,243 --> 01:00:09,477
there are no plum blossoms.

1587
01:00:09,477 --> 01:00:12,410
It's sad to miss it though.

1588
01:00:12,410 --> 01:00:14,777
So we will see the plum blossoms through food.

1589
01:00:14,777 --> 01:00:17,277
- They have plum blossom latte. / - Really?

1590
01:00:17,910 --> 01:00:19,643
- Goodness. / - It looks pretty, doesn't it?

1591
01:00:20,377 --> 01:00:22,143
And these are plum blossom macarons.

1592
01:00:22,143 --> 01:00:23,310
They come out like this.

1593
01:00:23,310 --> 01:00:25,377
- Isn't that pretty? / - It's so pretty.

1594
01:00:25,377 --> 01:00:27,177
I'm really worried about my team now.

1595
01:00:27,177 --> 01:00:30,010
- Their reactions are so bad. / - That's a real flower.

1596
01:00:30,010 --> 01:00:32,677
When guys eat bulgogi and it's really good,

1597
01:00:32,677 --> 01:00:33,677
they go...

1598
01:00:35,077 --> 01:00:36,043
The end.

1599
01:00:38,243 --> 01:00:43,177
(The famous plum blossom shaped macarons)

1600
01:00:44,377 --> 01:00:48,310
(They look super cute)

1601
01:00:49,910 --> 01:00:51,577
(Plum blossom macarons, $2 each)

1602
01:00:54,310 --> 01:00:56,177
We took so many pictures.

1603
01:00:56,177 --> 01:00:57,443
They're great for photographs.

1604
01:00:57,443 --> 01:00:59,810
(She's taking pictures again)

1605
01:01:00,377 --> 01:01:03,243
They're so pretty.

1606
01:01:03,243 --> 01:01:06,077
It's perfect girly photos to upload on social media.

1607
01:01:06,077 --> 01:01:08,143
- That 20s feel. / - What does it taste like?

1608
01:01:09,510 --> 01:01:10,877
This is raspberry cream cheese and

1609
01:01:10,877 --> 01:01:12,243
this is cream cheese.

1610
01:01:12,843 --> 01:01:15,677
(Yoojung takes a bite)

1611
01:01:17,443 --> 01:01:20,643
(Mina takes a bite too)

1612
01:01:21,810 --> 01:01:23,243
They say it's the best macaron

1613
01:01:23,243 --> 01:01:25,510
if it doesn't crumble...

1614
01:01:25,510 --> 01:01:26,910
- When you bite into it. / - It didn't crumble!

1615
01:01:26,910 --> 01:01:28,310
That didn't crumble.

1616
01:01:28,310 --> 01:01:30,543
- That macaron was so soft. / - Yes.

1617
01:01:30,543 --> 01:01:33,177
- It went in slowly like this. / - Like this.

1618
01:01:33,177 --> 01:01:35,443
- Isn't it really chewy? / - Yes.

1619
01:01:35,443 --> 01:01:38,810
It goes in like this.

1620
01:01:38,810 --> 01:01:40,777
It goes like this.

1621
01:01:40,777 --> 01:01:43,577
I've never had a macaron this chewy.

1622
01:01:43,577 --> 01:01:45,343
I highly recommend this.

1623
01:01:47,843 --> 01:01:50,810
(Cream cheese macaron this time)

1624
01:01:51,977 --> 01:01:54,277
(Mmm)

1625
01:01:55,810 --> 01:01:57,510
It's so delicious.

1626
01:01:58,310 --> 01:02:00,410
Some people don't like sweet stuff that much.

1627
01:02:00,410 --> 01:02:02,477
I don't think this is that sweet.

1628
01:02:02,477 --> 01:02:04,010
It's not that sweet.

1629
01:02:04,010 --> 01:02:06,010
Now, we have to drink milk tea right after.

1630
01:02:06,010 --> 01:02:08,743
It's so pretty, I feel bad eating it.

1631
01:02:09,643 --> 01:02:12,977
(What's this flower?)

1632
01:02:12,977 --> 01:02:14,543
It's a real flower!

1633
01:02:15,843 --> 01:02:17,277
Hey, it's a real flower.

1634
01:02:17,743 --> 01:02:18,977
It's a real flower!

1635
01:02:18,977 --> 01:02:19,710
She has a great reaction.

1636
01:02:19,710 --> 01:02:22,077
- That milk tea is so pretty. / - Hey, it's a real flower.

1637
01:02:22,510 --> 01:02:25,610
(Spray rose means "I can't stop admiring")

1638
01:02:26,377 --> 01:02:29,877
(I have to taste it even if it's pretty)

1639
01:02:32,543 --> 01:02:33,477
Wow.

1640
01:02:34,077 --> 01:02:34,977
Why?

1641
01:02:34,977 --> 01:02:36,610
It's so good!

1642
01:02:36,610 --> 01:02:38,677
(Smiling brightly)

1643
01:02:38,677 --> 01:02:40,543
What kind of milk tea is this?

1644
01:02:41,077 --> 01:02:43,577
It's a mix of earl grey, assam

1645
01:02:43,577 --> 01:02:46,943
and English breakfast are blended.

1646
01:02:46,943 --> 01:02:49,110
I knew it.

1647
01:02:49,110 --> 01:02:52,410
I love milk tea so much,

1648
01:02:52,410 --> 01:02:55,710
so I tried many different kinds but this tastes new.

1649
01:02:56,210 --> 01:02:59,810
It has a flowery aftertaste.

1650
01:02:59,810 --> 01:03:01,043
It's so good.

1651
01:03:01,043 --> 01:03:03,577
Three kinds of tea are blended together,

1652
01:03:03,577 --> 01:03:06,310
so unlike other milk teas, it tastes more like a flower.

1653
01:03:07,277 --> 01:03:09,110
This milk tea is so good.

1654
01:03:09,110 --> 01:03:10,943
I'm quite shocked by this.

1655
01:03:12,877 --> 01:03:15,343
We had plum blossom macarons,

1656
01:03:15,343 --> 01:03:16,810
so now we'll have a latte.

1657
01:03:16,810 --> 01:03:18,743
One dessert after another. Nice.

1658
01:03:18,743 --> 01:03:20,143
Let's go have some latte.

1659
01:03:20,143 --> 01:03:21,177
Let's go.

1660
01:03:22,443 --> 01:03:24,310
(She packs the leftovers)

1661
01:03:24,310 --> 01:03:26,977
It's a great set. Macaroon and milk tea.

1662
01:03:26,977 --> 01:03:27,943
It's a perfect combination.

1663
01:03:28,577 --> 01:03:33,243
(They're on their way to have plum blossom latte)

1664
01:03:33,410 --> 01:03:37,077
This place is 5 minutes away from the macaron shop.

1665
01:03:37,077 --> 01:03:38,643
- Really? / - It's really close.

1666
01:03:38,643 --> 01:03:40,510
It's right here.

1667
01:03:41,777 --> 01:03:43,677
- Hello. / - Hello.

1668
01:03:45,810 --> 01:03:46,977
It's pretty.

1669
01:03:46,977 --> 01:03:49,343
- The cafe is so pretty. / - It is.

1670
01:03:49,643 --> 01:03:52,377
We're going to have this.

1671
01:03:52,377 --> 01:03:54,310
Plum blossom...

1672
01:03:56,243 --> 01:03:58,443
- You have to have that. / - It's so pretty.

1673
01:03:59,277 --> 01:04:01,910
(Adorable plum blossom latte)

1674
01:04:02,243 --> 01:04:04,443
(Plum blossom latte with pink whipped cream)

1675
01:04:04,443 --> 01:04:05,343
It's really pretty.

1676
01:04:06,410 --> 01:04:07,410
It's really pretty.

1677
01:04:08,643 --> 01:04:09,810
Did you hear that?

1678
01:04:10,810 --> 01:04:12,477
"It's really pretty."

1679
01:04:13,577 --> 01:04:15,243
That was from the bottom of his heart.

1680
01:04:15,643 --> 01:04:16,810
Right?

1681
01:04:16,810 --> 01:04:18,343
It was.

1682
01:04:19,843 --> 01:04:21,010
It's so pretty.

1683
01:04:21,010 --> 01:04:22,210
It's so pretty.

1684
01:04:22,877 --> 01:04:26,377
Won't it look pretty if we take pictures with these?

1685
01:04:26,377 --> 01:04:27,677
- Shall we? / - Since they're all plum blossoms.

1686
01:04:27,677 --> 01:04:28,677
Good, good.

1687
01:04:28,677 --> 01:04:31,010
This is perfect for taking pictures,

1688
01:04:31,010 --> 01:04:33,310
when you come with a friend.

1689
01:04:33,710 --> 01:04:35,210
It's so pretty.

1690
01:04:36,077 --> 01:04:38,143
Take them right away.

1691
01:04:39,143 --> 01:04:45,677
(She takes pictures with all her heart)

1692
01:04:46,277 --> 01:04:48,677
(Burning it up)

1693
01:04:50,010 --> 01:04:52,777
(Plum blossom latte, macaron)

1694
01:04:53,210 --> 01:04:56,310
You can use a straw to drink this...

1695
01:04:56,777 --> 01:04:59,977
But it's better to drink it like this

1696
01:04:59,977 --> 01:05:01,543
so you can drink in with the cream.

1697
01:05:02,110 --> 01:05:03,443
It's really delicious that way.

1698
01:05:03,943 --> 01:05:07,243
It's not the cream you think.

1699
01:05:07,243 --> 01:05:08,310
It's not whipping cream.

1700
01:05:08,310 --> 01:05:10,310
It's really so...

1701
01:05:10,310 --> 01:05:11,377
How should I explain?

1702
01:05:11,377 --> 01:05:12,610
I was taken aback.

1703
01:05:12,610 --> 01:05:16,677
When I drank it, the cream didn't go into my mouth.

1704
01:05:17,710 --> 01:05:19,010
That's "Secret Garden."

1705
01:05:20,477 --> 01:05:22,277
You have a mouthful of cream

1706
01:05:22,277 --> 01:05:24,877
and coffee suddenly goes in.

1707
01:05:24,877 --> 01:05:27,943
The condensed milk cream was really dense.

1708
01:05:28,710 --> 01:05:30,277
- The cream is so good. / - Yoojung.

1709
01:05:30,910 --> 01:05:34,177
(They drink it one more time)

1710
01:05:37,443 --> 01:05:40,677
You can even chew the cream. It's that dense.

1711
01:05:43,577 --> 01:05:44,810
- Condensed milk. / - Condensed milk...

1712
01:05:44,810 --> 01:05:47,410
- That's cheating. / - Cheating.

1713
01:05:47,410 --> 01:05:47,877
Really?

1714
01:05:47,877 --> 01:05:49,577
- That's cheating. / - Do you want to try this?

1715
01:05:49,577 --> 01:05:50,810
Try this.

1716
01:06:00,243 --> 01:06:02,910
This one has a strong coffee smell.

1717
01:06:03,677 --> 01:06:04,610
People who can't drink coffee

1718
01:06:04,610 --> 01:06:06,610
can drink this.

1719
01:06:07,377 --> 01:06:09,577
This feels like eating...

1720
01:06:09,577 --> 01:06:11,810
- A pink cloud. / - You're right.

1721
01:06:11,810 --> 01:06:14,510
I've never tasted a pink cloud...

1722
01:06:14,510 --> 01:06:17,510
- But that's how you'd describe it. / - Right.

1723
01:06:18,410 --> 01:06:20,610
- It's sweet. / - The cafe is very cute.

1724
01:06:26,477 --> 01:06:29,510
(I finished it)

1725
01:06:30,177 --> 01:06:33,943
- One more plum blossom latte. / - She had two.

1726
01:06:34,777 --> 01:06:36,510
You said you don't eat much.

1727
01:06:36,510 --> 01:06:37,977
Thank you.

1728
01:06:38,777 --> 01:06:44,910
(They enjoy spring as they drink plum blossom latte)

1729
01:06:47,743 --> 01:06:52,410
I looked, but there is no rooftop bar in Gwangyang.

1730
01:06:52,410 --> 01:06:55,043
But I found a better place.

1731
01:06:55,043 --> 01:06:56,143
- Really? / - Yes.

1732
01:06:56,143 --> 01:06:59,343
- We don't need to go to a rooftop bar. / - Really?

1733
01:06:59,343 --> 01:07:00,610
- We don't need to go. / - Really?

1734
01:07:00,610 --> 01:07:03,643
I found a really great wine bar.

1735
01:07:03,643 --> 01:07:04,743
So we...

1736
01:07:05,910 --> 01:07:08,343
I don't know. I really like that place.

1737
01:07:08,343 --> 01:07:10,343
Look at her. She's happy just thinking about it.

1738
01:07:10,343 --> 01:07:12,343
What a great time.

1739
01:07:13,477 --> 01:07:17,310
We've gotten changed again.

1740
01:07:18,010 --> 01:07:20,810
We're dressed up nicely.

1741
01:07:22,343 --> 01:07:24,577
We'll take a cab

1742
01:07:24,577 --> 01:07:26,077
to the wine bar.

1743
01:07:28,110 --> 01:07:30,210
Hello.

1744
01:07:32,977 --> 01:07:36,043
I'm really excited. I've never been to a wine bar.

1745
01:07:36,810 --> 01:07:38,977
Are you taking a cab to the wine bar?

1746
01:07:38,977 --> 01:07:40,677
But you take a bus everywhere else.

1747
01:07:41,843 --> 01:07:43,810
- Cab for the wine bar... / - They got changed too.

1748
01:07:43,810 --> 01:07:45,577
- They're spending money. / - They got changed.

1749
01:07:45,577 --> 01:07:47,877
- Our clothes... / - You need that black cab.

1750
01:07:48,210 --> 01:07:50,010
I feel like we shouldn't be here.

1751
01:07:50,010 --> 01:07:51,243
No, we have to hold our heads up.

1752
01:07:51,243 --> 01:07:54,043
- We're 20 years old. / - Right.

1753
01:07:54,043 --> 01:07:55,877
- We can go in. / - That's right.

1754
01:07:57,177 --> 01:07:59,310
I understand why you want to dress up.

1755
01:07:59,310 --> 01:08:01,710
- I'm scared. / - Let's not show that it's our first time.

1756
01:08:01,710 --> 01:08:03,610
They don't want to show that it's their first time.

1757
01:08:04,543 --> 01:08:07,243
- Hello. / - Having your first dress shoes...

1758
01:08:07,577 --> 01:08:08,677
At age 20.

1759
01:08:08,677 --> 01:08:10,810
You can never forget. I still remember too.

1760
01:08:10,810 --> 01:08:12,377
Hello.

1761
01:08:14,443 --> 01:08:15,877
This is weird.

1762
01:08:16,077 --> 01:08:18,810
(They're given a menu)

1763
01:08:19,410 --> 01:08:20,743
(What does this mean?)

1764
01:08:20,743 --> 01:08:22,910
- But we don't know about wine. / - Of course not.

1765
01:08:22,910 --> 01:08:23,843
It was too difficult.

1766
01:08:23,843 --> 01:08:25,410
- It's difficult. / - What do we do?

1767
01:08:25,943 --> 01:08:28,043
I still don't get wine.

1768
01:08:28,043 --> 01:08:29,610
Can you recommend us something?

1769
01:08:29,610 --> 01:08:31,443
We don't know much about wine.

1770
01:08:31,443 --> 01:08:33,643
The bestselling wine at our bar is

1771
01:08:34,443 --> 01:08:36,110
(Ca'Bianca? What?)

1772
01:08:36,110 --> 01:08:41,477
(What? I have no idea what he's saying)

1773
01:08:42,843 --> 01:08:45,210
I'll tell you what to do as an expert.

1774
01:08:45,210 --> 01:08:46,643
Take recommendations and keep

1775
01:08:46,643 --> 01:08:48,010
drinking different ones.

1776
01:08:48,010 --> 01:08:49,710
Then once you find one that you like,

1777
01:08:49,710 --> 01:08:51,543
memorize the name.

1778
01:08:51,543 --> 01:08:53,043
Memorize what it's called?

1779
01:08:53,043 --> 01:08:54,510
- Memorize the taste. / - Once you memorize that...

1780
01:08:54,510 --> 01:08:56,410
That becomes your standard.

1781
01:08:56,410 --> 01:08:58,010
Wine starts from there.

1782
01:08:58,010 --> 01:09:00,043
- He's Muhammad Ali of drinking. / - Seriously...

1783
01:09:00,043 --> 01:09:02,510
You should learn how to drink from Sikyung.

1784
01:09:06,077 --> 01:09:07,877
(The bartender leaves)

1785
01:09:09,843 --> 01:09:12,177
I can't remember the names.

1786
01:09:12,177 --> 01:09:14,077
All I remember is d'Acqui.

1787
01:09:14,077 --> 01:09:18,543
Even if I pretend to be an adult, I can't fake it.

1788
01:09:22,177 --> 01:09:24,243
It bubbles up a little bit.

1789
01:09:24,243 --> 01:09:26,410
So it's easy to enjoy.

1790
01:09:28,110 --> 01:09:29,110
It's pretty.

1791
01:09:29,110 --> 01:09:31,443
- It looks tasty. / - It's affordable too.

1792
01:09:31,443 --> 01:09:32,443
It looks good.

1793
01:09:33,577 --> 01:09:35,643
Thank you.

1794
01:09:37,910 --> 01:09:40,410
This is awkward.

1795
01:09:41,943 --> 01:09:42,877
I feel awkward.

1796
01:09:44,443 --> 01:09:46,377
This is awkward.

1797
01:09:46,377 --> 01:09:49,177
- I feel weird. / - This is too...

1798
01:09:50,543 --> 01:09:52,377
That's a pretty sound.

1799
01:09:52,377 --> 01:09:54,677
(Stiff)

1800
01:09:58,477 --> 01:09:59,943
It's good.

1801
01:09:59,943 --> 01:10:03,477
I like how it tickles my nose.

1802
01:10:03,477 --> 01:10:06,410
Why does it tickle my nose?

1803
01:10:06,410 --> 01:10:07,243
That's the wine bouquet.

1804
01:10:07,243 --> 01:10:08,543
- This is the bouquet? / - Yes.

1805
01:10:09,110 --> 01:10:12,543
(Yoojung learns about wine bouquet)

1806
01:10:12,543 --> 01:10:14,943
You look good with wine.

1807
01:10:14,943 --> 01:10:16,643
She seems mature when she's drinking wine.

1808
01:10:16,643 --> 01:10:19,277
- It suits her. / - She didn't hunch when she drank wine.

1809
01:10:19,277 --> 01:10:22,010
- You're right. / - She sits up straight.

1810
01:10:22,010 --> 01:10:23,943
She hunched over when she ate spicy rice cakes.

1811
01:10:27,010 --> 01:10:29,843
(Wait, this looks like it's for grownups)

1812
01:10:30,077 --> 01:10:31,143
What?

1813
01:10:34,243 --> 01:10:37,077
- Gosh, this is weird. / - I know.

1814
01:10:37,077 --> 01:10:39,910
- Thank you for the food. / - Thank you.

1815
01:10:39,910 --> 01:10:42,877
Eat then drink? Or drink then eat?

1816
01:10:42,877 --> 01:10:45,510
- You're such beginners. / - Whichever way you want.

1817
01:10:46,277 --> 01:10:47,810
I'll try this first.

1818
01:10:52,510 --> 01:10:54,910
(Yoojung and Mina are playing grownups)

1819
01:10:54,910 --> 01:10:55,910
It suits her.

1820
01:10:55,910 --> 01:10:57,710
- Like she's experienced. / - It suits them.

1821
01:10:57,710 --> 01:11:00,010
Mina looks good too.

1822
01:11:03,277 --> 01:11:07,743
(Staring at Yoojung)

1823
01:11:08,977 --> 01:11:10,943
(What's wrong?)

1824
01:11:10,943 --> 01:11:14,310
It feels so weird. I can't believe you're drinking.

1825
01:11:14,310 --> 01:11:15,743
I feel the same.

1826
01:11:16,743 --> 01:11:18,110
They think it's funny.

1827
01:11:18,110 --> 01:11:20,177
Now I can feel

1828
01:11:20,177 --> 01:11:22,010
that we're 20.

1829
01:11:23,877 --> 01:11:26,343
- This is the last day of our trip. / - Right.

1830
01:11:26,343 --> 01:11:28,310
The trip will end after we see the rainbow fountain.

1831
01:11:28,310 --> 01:11:30,977
- Don't you feel sad? / - I don't want to go back.

1832
01:11:30,977 --> 01:11:33,110
Don't you feel sad? Right?

1833
01:11:33,110 --> 01:11:35,577
But the fountain will be great.

1834
01:11:35,577 --> 01:11:36,977
- Is it good? / - Yes, it's huge.

1835
01:11:36,977 --> 01:11:37,343
Is it?

1836
01:11:37,343 --> 01:11:39,877
You can look forward to seeing it.

1837
01:11:39,877 --> 01:11:42,410
Can I look forward to it? Alright.

1838
01:11:42,977 --> 01:11:46,743
(Darkness falls over Seocheon)

1839
01:11:47,577 --> 01:11:49,443
This is the last course of our trip.

1840
01:11:49,443 --> 01:11:50,910
Such a shame.

1841
01:11:52,077 --> 01:11:52,843
What's that?

1842
01:11:52,843 --> 01:11:55,777
That's the Rainbow Bridge.

1843
01:11:55,777 --> 01:11:57,710
The lights come on at night.

1844
01:11:58,477 --> 01:11:59,743
It's beautiful.

1845
01:12:02,010 --> 01:12:03,677
(Jaw-dropping)

1846
01:12:05,710 --> 01:12:07,710
They have the best reactions.

1847
01:12:07,710 --> 01:12:10,643
- The best. / - Such good reactions.

1848
01:12:12,277 --> 01:12:13,477
Isn't it fascinating?

1849
01:12:13,477 --> 01:12:15,243
They go up so high.

1850
01:12:18,743 --> 01:12:21,410
It feels refreshing to see the fountain in front.

1851
01:12:22,343 --> 01:12:25,010
So pretty.

1852
01:12:26,877 --> 01:12:27,877
- Wow. / - Wow.

1853
01:12:27,877 --> 01:12:29,410
Music, lights, fountain.

1854
01:12:29,410 --> 01:12:31,810
- All in sync, right? / - Yes.

1855
01:12:33,210 --> 01:12:35,810
It's high enough to reach for the stars.

1856
01:12:35,810 --> 01:12:38,543
(The first song is over)

1857
01:12:38,910 --> 01:12:41,143
(The next song continues)

1858
01:12:42,277 --> 01:12:47,743
("On a Spring Day with Cherry Blossoms" by J-Cera)

1859
01:12:51,677 --> 01:12:53,543
Yoojung.

1860
01:12:54,277 --> 01:12:55,777
Mina.

1861
01:12:55,777 --> 01:12:58,277
It feels somewhat touching.

1862
01:12:58,277 --> 01:13:00,477
It feels so good to watch it with your best friend.

1863
01:13:02,443 --> 01:13:05,043
(The words "You and Me" appear all of a sudden)

1864
01:13:05,443 --> 01:13:07,810
(What's going on?)

1865
01:13:10,677 --> 01:13:12,210
Is that possible?

1866
01:13:13,877 --> 01:13:17,377
Congratulations.

1867
01:13:18,477 --> 01:13:19,610
Wait a minute.

1868
01:13:19,610 --> 01:13:22,443
- What's going on? / - I prepared this.

1869
01:13:22,443 --> 01:13:23,543
I just got goosebumps.

1870
01:13:24,210 --> 01:13:25,610
Ta-da.

1871
01:13:25,610 --> 01:13:27,177
- You did this? / - Yeah.

1872
01:13:27,177 --> 01:13:28,577
When did you do this?

1873
01:13:28,577 --> 01:13:31,410
- Can you make a request in advance? / - Yes.

1874
01:13:31,410 --> 01:13:34,910
You can upload words or photos on the homepage.

1875
01:13:34,910 --> 01:13:37,643
- Congratulations on being 20. / - Mina, you're so clever.

1876
01:13:41,910 --> 01:13:43,910
We're 20...

1877
01:13:46,677 --> 01:13:48,010
I feel sad.

1878
01:13:48,010 --> 01:13:49,777
You can also display a photo.

1879
01:13:51,943 --> 01:13:52,777
Isn't so pretty.

1880
01:13:52,777 --> 01:13:55,210
This is so touching.

1881
01:13:55,210 --> 01:13:57,243
I can't believe we're 20.

1882
01:14:08,277 --> 01:14:10,843
I think we had...

1883
01:14:12,143 --> 01:14:16,677
Some time for inner peace. It was so enjoyable.

1884
01:14:18,777 --> 01:14:21,777
- You both became 20 this year. / - Right.

1885
01:14:22,310 --> 01:14:24,343
She organized it and cried alone.

1886
01:14:24,343 --> 01:14:25,077
This is so nice.

1887
01:14:25,077 --> 01:14:26,977
When you're with a good friend, you get emotional.

1888
01:14:26,977 --> 01:14:28,377
You really do.

1889
01:14:32,677 --> 01:14:34,477
It feels so special that we're on

1890
01:14:34,477 --> 01:14:36,410
a trip to celebrate the age of 20.

1891
01:14:42,410 --> 01:14:46,310
(Yoobom Nabom enjoy their trip to the last moment)

1892
01:14:46,310 --> 01:14:48,977
- I bet you'll remember this trip forever. / - Yes.

1893
01:14:48,977 --> 01:14:49,577
Right?

1894
01:14:49,577 --> 01:14:52,243
We were a team, so we spent a lot of time together...

1895
01:14:52,243 --> 01:14:54,843
- But it was our first trip. / - First time.

1896
01:14:54,843 --> 01:14:58,377
I came on the first trip of my life after turning 20.

1897
01:14:58,377 --> 01:15:01,843
I'm glad that I came here with you.

1898
01:15:01,843 --> 01:15:03,810
It feels more special and meaningful with you.

1899
01:15:03,810 --> 01:15:06,110
We'll go on a trip together again when we become 30.

1900
01:15:06,110 --> 01:15:08,510
- 30? / - That's nice.

1901
01:15:08,510 --> 01:15:11,010
It was amazing.

1902
01:15:11,010 --> 01:15:13,943
Yoobom Nabom, spring is here!

1903
01:15:14,677 --> 01:15:16,510
- Bye. / - Bye.

1904
01:15:20,910 --> 01:15:24,243
(The end of Yoojung and Mina's spring)

1905
01:15:27,210 --> 01:15:29,277
I feel so bad for Jooe.

1906
01:15:29,277 --> 01:15:30,210
- Suddenly? / - Yes.

1907
01:15:30,210 --> 01:15:33,110
Because I saw Jooe feel envious

1908
01:15:33,110 --> 01:15:34,877
watching their trip.

1909
01:15:34,877 --> 01:15:37,243
Which part were you most envious of?

1910
01:15:37,243 --> 01:15:39,510
- The bulgogi. / - I knew it.

1911
01:15:39,510 --> 01:15:41,777
The macaron and latte.

1912
01:15:43,243 --> 01:15:44,643
Food is the best.

1913
01:15:44,643 --> 01:15:47,743
I think the bulgogi was the highlight.

1914
01:15:47,743 --> 01:15:49,010
- I agree. / - It's true.

1915
01:15:49,010 --> 01:15:52,243
The meat is very juicy.

1916
01:15:52,243 --> 01:15:53,643
When you eat marinated meat...

1917
01:15:53,643 --> 01:15:56,077
- You only taste the sauce. / - Right.

1918
01:15:56,077 --> 01:15:58,510
But this one is fresher.

1919
01:15:58,510 --> 01:16:00,010
He's right.

1920
01:16:00,010 --> 01:16:01,443
When we had the bulgogi, we kept saying

1921
01:16:01,443 --> 01:16:04,277
that the meat is so thin but it is very juicy.

1922
01:16:04,277 --> 01:16:06,010
- We said that so much. / - Right.

1923
01:16:06,010 --> 01:16:09,677
- It just melts in your mouth. / - Yes.

1924
01:16:09,677 --> 01:16:10,743
It just melts away.

1925
01:16:10,743 --> 01:16:13,243
I was impressed to see so many kinds

1926
01:16:13,243 --> 01:16:14,777
of flowers in Korea.

1927
01:16:14,777 --> 01:16:17,277
The Netherlands, various countries, Germany...

1928
01:16:17,277 --> 01:16:18,877
There were all sorts of countries.

1929
01:16:18,877 --> 01:16:21,210
I've never seen such things before.

1930
01:16:21,210 --> 01:16:23,710
I have a vague recollection of being there.

1931
01:16:23,710 --> 01:16:25,910
You should leave plenty of time for it.

1932
01:16:25,910 --> 01:16:26,677
- You're right. / - Yes.

1933
01:16:26,677 --> 01:16:29,243
It's a huge place.

1934
01:16:29,243 --> 01:16:30,543
Which place was the prettiest?

1935
01:16:30,543 --> 01:16:34,643
Our favorite was the Dutch Garden.

1936
01:16:34,643 --> 01:16:37,077
There was a huge windmill.

1937
01:16:37,077 --> 01:16:40,443
And we could see many other gardens on the way.

1938
01:16:40,443 --> 01:16:43,410
So you can enjoy as you go.

1939
01:16:43,410 --> 01:16:44,977
Alright.

1940
01:16:44,977 --> 01:16:46,643
This is the most important moment.

1941
01:16:46,643 --> 01:16:48,410
The total cost of...

1942
01:16:48,410 --> 01:16:50,877
- The Yoobom Nabom Tour. / - The cost.

1943
01:16:50,877 --> 01:16:53,677
- This is important. / - How much did you spend?

1944
01:16:53,677 --> 01:16:56,177
For the overnight trip of the Yoobom Nabom Tour

1945
01:16:56,177 --> 01:16:59,143
in Suncheon, Gwangyang, we spent...

1946
01:16:59,143 --> 01:17:00,010
How much?

1947
01:17:00,010 --> 01:17:02,610
Excluding the KTX fare.

1948
01:17:02,610 --> 01:17:04,210
- Per person... / - Per person!

1949
01:17:04,810 --> 01:17:08,477
$162.85.

1950
01:17:11,477 --> 01:17:13,110
That's very cheap.

1951
01:17:13,110 --> 01:17:15,343
- That's including accommodation, right? / - Yes.

1952
01:17:15,343 --> 01:17:17,310
- And the entry fee earlier? / - Yes.

1953
01:17:17,310 --> 01:17:20,277
- Two cups of latte. / - That's right.

1954
01:17:20,277 --> 01:17:22,443
- You ate too much. / - We had too much bulgogi.

1955
01:17:22,443 --> 01:17:24,510
Wine...

1956
01:17:24,510 --> 01:17:28,243
Would you go to Suncheon and Gwangyang

1957
01:17:28,243 --> 01:17:31,410
according to Yoobom Nabom Tour's plan?

1958
01:17:31,410 --> 01:17:33,377
Please vote.

1959
01:17:34,210 --> 01:17:36,443
(They planned a spring flower trip at 20)

1960
01:17:36,443 --> 01:17:40,110
(What will the judges choose?)

1961
01:17:41,743 --> 01:17:43,743
The first trip in their 20s isn't over yet.

1962
01:17:43,743 --> 01:17:44,243
Right.

1963
01:17:44,243 --> 01:17:46,010
It's time to head off to Hadong,

1964
01:17:46,010 --> 01:17:47,810
a place you can visit all year round.

1965
01:17:48,443 --> 01:17:49,377
(Next week)

1966
01:17:50,377 --> 01:17:52,043
It's a first with you.

1967
01:17:52,043 --> 01:17:54,110
