00:00:00,877 --> 00:00:04,310
(Numerous great tips for trips)

2
00:00:06,610 --> 00:00:07,877
(Kim Sook, Sung Sikyung)

3
00:00:08,743 --> 00:00:10,077
(Lee Hwijae, N of VIXX)

4
00:00:12,110 --> 00:00:13,177
Travel is war.

5
00:00:13,177 --> 00:00:16,110
Battle Trip!

6
00:00:18,643 --> 00:00:20,943
Alright, everyone.

7
00:00:20,943 --> 00:00:23,210
We have a special host for today's episode.

8
00:00:23,210 --> 00:00:25,310
He's N of VIXX. Come on!

9
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:29,210
Hello, I'm N of VIXX.

10
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:32,343
I've prepared myself as the special host today.

11
00:00:32,343 --> 00:00:33,677
I'm honored to be here.

12
00:00:33,677 --> 00:00:34,810
Thank you so much.

13
00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:39,043
It feels like he's been here the whole time.

14
00:00:39,477 --> 00:00:41,577
I feel comfortable being here too.

15
00:00:41,577 --> 00:00:43,043
You must like our show.

16
00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:44,210
I love it.

17
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:46,777
I always told my agent to keep an eye on this show.

18
00:00:46,777 --> 00:00:47,577
"Keep an eye on it."

19
00:00:47,577 --> 00:00:48,810
I told him to keep an eye on it

20
00:00:48,810 --> 00:00:50,377
so when there's an opening,

21
00:00:50,377 --> 00:00:52,043
I can swoop right in.

22
00:00:52,043 --> 00:00:53,310
That's what I told him.

23
00:00:53,310 --> 00:00:55,810
Anyway, we are joined by

24
00:00:55,810 --> 00:00:58,110
N of VIXX who loves traveling.

25
00:00:58,110 --> 00:01:00,310
We have an amazing special this week. Sikyung?

26
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:02,010
Right. It's next week already.

27
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:02,977
Passion. Connected.

28
00:01:02,977 --> 00:01:04,943
The PyeongChang 2018 Olympic Winter Games

29
00:01:04,943 --> 00:01:06,477
will begin on February 9th.

30
00:01:06,477 --> 00:01:08,743
The worldwide festival will take place

31
00:01:08,743 --> 00:01:10,610
close by in Gangwon-do.

32
00:01:10,610 --> 00:01:12,377
We must partake in the festivities too.

33
00:01:12,377 --> 00:01:14,143
So this week, it will be a special episode.

34
00:01:14,577 --> 00:01:16,310
It's always a special.

35
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:18,643
The PyeongChang Winter Olympics special,

36
00:01:18,643 --> 00:01:19,943
we'll head to Gangwon-do.

37
00:01:21,477 --> 00:01:22,810
I love Gangwon-do.

38
00:01:22,810 --> 00:01:24,443
In the previous episode,

39
00:01:24,443 --> 00:01:30,343
I chose sports as the traveling trend of 2018.

40
00:01:30,343 --> 00:01:31,243
That's right.

41
00:01:31,243 --> 00:01:33,343
And the start of that trend will be

42
00:01:33,343 --> 00:01:35,877
2018 PyeongChang Olympics that's starting next week.

43
00:01:35,877 --> 00:01:39,343
So when you think about Gangwon-do,

44
00:01:39,343 --> 00:01:42,677
there are lots of places to visit as well as food to try.

45
00:01:42,677 --> 00:01:45,243
After hearing what Hwijae said,

46
00:01:45,243 --> 00:01:48,510
I was convinced that Battle Trip and I are meant to be.

47
00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:49,943
You keep pushing toward that.

48
00:01:49,943 --> 00:01:52,110
The thing is that I was the torchbearer.

49
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:53,110
You were?

50
00:01:53,110 --> 00:01:54,610
Yes, as the torchbearer,

51
00:01:54,610 --> 00:01:56,977
I carried the torch.

52
00:01:56,977 --> 00:01:59,010
I thought that's why you invited me.

53
00:01:59,543 --> 00:02:02,343
As far as I know, Seolhyun was a torchbearer too.

54
00:02:02,343 --> 00:02:04,577
But I made headlines for it.

55
00:02:04,577 --> 00:02:06,777
- Really? / - He's a smooth talker.

56
00:02:06,777 --> 00:02:08,110
You suit our show.

57
00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:10,210
There's a limit for this special.

58
00:02:10,210 --> 00:02:13,277
The budget limit for the trip to Gangwon-do is...

59
00:02:13,277 --> 00:02:15,010
- $100. / - Goodness.

60
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:16,477
And it will be a day trip.

61
00:02:16,477 --> 00:02:17,643
A day trip.

62
00:02:17,643 --> 00:02:18,743
$100 is doable with Gangwon-do.

63
00:02:18,743 --> 00:02:20,610
- I know where I'll be going. / - It's doable.

64
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:21,810
- Where? / - For $100 in Gangwon-do.

65
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:24,777
I'll head straight to Hoengseong

66
00:02:24,777 --> 00:02:26,410
and have some beef.

67
00:02:26,410 --> 00:02:27,643
Have $90 worth of beef.

68
00:02:27,643 --> 00:02:29,610
- $90 worth. / - Then on the way back...

69
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:31,677
Buy some Anheung steamed buns.

70
00:02:31,677 --> 00:02:33,977
Eat some steamed buns on the way.

71
00:02:33,977 --> 00:02:35,110
Then it will be exactly $100.

72
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:36,777
Why would you eat beef and carbs?

73
00:02:36,777 --> 00:02:38,977
Gangwon-do has the ocean.

74
00:02:38,977 --> 00:02:41,543
- Raw fish? / - I went to Jumunjin Market...

75
00:02:41,543 --> 00:02:42,377
And had some raw fish.

76
00:02:42,377 --> 00:02:44,177
I had $60 worth of raw fish.

77
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:47,243
4 people ate till our stomachs were about to pop.

78
00:02:48,077 --> 00:02:50,310
We had two plates piled up with fish.

79
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:53,143
They don't cover the bottom with display radish.

80
00:02:53,143 --> 00:02:55,443
- That's right. / - It's just a mountain of fish.

81
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:58,277
We had herring since they were in season.

82
00:02:59,743 --> 00:03:00,410
It's delicious.

83
00:03:00,410 --> 00:03:01,543
It's to die for.

84
00:03:01,543 --> 00:03:04,110
Today, we have Gangwon-do special.

85
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:07,743
It's also a special for the PyeongChang Olympics.

86
00:03:07,743 --> 00:03:09,577
Let us invite our 4 trip designers.

87
00:03:09,577 --> 00:03:10,910
- Please come on out. / - Please come on out.

88
00:03:14,943 --> 00:03:17,243
(Seongjong and Woohyun of INFINITE)

89
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:20,677
(Mingyu and Seungkwan of SEVENTEEN)

90
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:24,010
(Goodness)

91
00:03:25,210 --> 00:03:26,177
It seems like a battle...

92
00:03:26,177 --> 00:03:29,177
- Between idol seniors and juniors. / - You're right.

93
00:03:29,177 --> 00:03:29,977
Will it be the eager SEVENTEEN?

94
00:03:29,977 --> 00:03:32,310
They aren't really rookies anymore.

95
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:34,377
Will it be the experienced INFINITE?

96
00:03:34,377 --> 00:03:35,510
That'll be the battle.

97
00:03:36,410 --> 00:03:37,977
But both of the teams...

98
00:03:37,977 --> 00:03:40,677
- Don't have time to travel, right? / - Right.

99
00:03:40,677 --> 00:03:43,410
- You're busy with concerts. / - Right.

100
00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:45,243
I came from Jeju-do yesterday.

101
00:03:45,877 --> 00:03:47,277
- By yourself? / - Yes, by myself.

102
00:03:47,277 --> 00:03:49,310
- Jeju-do? / - My friend lives there.

103
00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:50,077
Where in Jeju-do?

104
00:03:50,077 --> 00:03:51,777
- I'm from Jeju-do. / - Seogwipo.

105
00:03:51,777 --> 00:03:52,810
Yeah?

106
00:03:52,810 --> 00:03:54,077
Really?

107
00:03:54,077 --> 00:03:55,477
Really?

108
00:03:55,477 --> 00:03:56,477
Something like that.

109
00:03:56,477 --> 00:03:57,477
Seogwipo...

110
00:03:58,377 --> 00:04:00,410
(Speaking in Jeju dialect)

111
00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:03,043
(The local's pronunciation)

112
00:04:03,177 --> 00:04:05,877
Let's start our trip now.

113
00:04:05,877 --> 00:04:07,610
Where did these two teams go in Gangwon-do?

114
00:04:07,610 --> 00:04:10,343
First, Seongjong and Woohyun.

115
00:04:10,343 --> 00:04:13,477
The blue ocean and the scent of coffee...

116
00:04:13,477 --> 00:04:14,977
We went to the romantic...

117
00:04:14,977 --> 00:04:16,777
Gangneung in Gangwon-do.

118
00:04:16,777 --> 00:04:18,310
I love Gangneung.

119
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:19,643
Gangneung.

120
00:04:19,643 --> 00:04:21,377
Sitting by the ocean.

121
00:04:21,377 --> 00:04:23,710
With some fresh raw fish...

122
00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:24,543
With raw fish.

123
00:04:24,543 --> 00:04:25,710
Open your mouth and...

124
00:04:26,843 --> 00:04:27,910
We did that.

125
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:29,510
Just as you said,

126
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:31,543
we sat near the ocean,

127
00:04:31,543 --> 00:04:33,543
listened to the rough waves.

128
00:04:33,543 --> 00:04:36,277
- And had a drink. / - We had a drink.

129
00:04:36,277 --> 00:04:37,610
Seongjong didn't drink. It was just me.

130
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:39,443
Right. I didn't drink. Only Woohyun did.

131
00:04:39,443 --> 00:04:40,477
Why didn't you?

132
00:04:40,477 --> 00:04:43,410
I have a bad drinking habit.

133
00:04:43,977 --> 00:04:45,243
- I quit drinking. / - It's really terrible.

134
00:04:45,243 --> 00:04:47,177
- Why? I'm being honest. / - It's really bad.

135
00:04:47,177 --> 00:04:48,443
- I'm an honest person. / - It's terrible.

136
00:04:48,443 --> 00:04:49,443
Do you call people?

137
00:04:49,443 --> 00:04:51,943
I get really hyper.

138
00:04:51,943 --> 00:04:53,910
I was worried I'd get too hyper. I'm hyper as it is.

139
00:04:53,910 --> 00:04:54,977
So I quit drinking.

140
00:04:54,977 --> 00:04:57,610
- Where did our team go? / - Yes?

141
00:04:57,610 --> 00:04:59,377
The city we visited is

142
00:04:59,377 --> 00:05:02,243
a place where it's covered with snow.

143
00:05:02,243 --> 00:05:04,343
It's known as the Alps of Korea.

144
00:05:04,343 --> 00:05:06,643
It's the place the whole country

145
00:05:06,643 --> 00:05:08,677
fervently cheered for when it was announced

146
00:05:08,677 --> 00:05:10,110
that the Olympics would be held there.

147
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:11,610
That's the place.

148
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:12,510
It's Pyeongchang.

149
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:14,443
That's a great city.

150
00:05:16,043 --> 00:05:17,777
- It wasn't announced that slowly. / - Then?

151
00:05:17,777 --> 00:05:18,243
Pyeongchang.

152
00:05:18,243 --> 00:05:19,010
That's how it was done.

153
00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:20,210
- Really? / - Yes.

154
00:05:20,210 --> 00:05:21,110
Anyway.

155
00:05:22,377 --> 00:05:23,410
He doesn't care.

156
00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:24,943
- Why are you like that? / - He just...

157
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:27,043
He just cut me off.

158
00:05:27,277 --> 00:05:31,377
Please welcome our 100 judges in the audience

159
00:05:31,377 --> 00:05:33,377
who will make a fair evaluation. Nice to meet you all.

160
00:05:35,377 --> 00:05:36,643
It's a single-round match.

161
00:05:36,643 --> 00:05:37,710
After watching the clip,

162
00:05:37,710 --> 00:05:39,543
if you want to visit,

163
00:05:39,543 --> 00:05:41,210
you can cast your vote.

164
00:05:41,210 --> 00:05:43,910
You can vote for both of the trips.

165
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:45,277
- So relax. / - You can vote for both trips.

166
00:05:45,277 --> 00:05:47,677
Both teams have a budget

167
00:05:47,677 --> 00:05:49,343
of $100 for the trip.

168
00:05:49,843 --> 00:05:53,043
They also have the same means of transportation.

169
00:05:53,043 --> 00:05:54,677
Woohyun, how did you get there?

170
00:05:54,977 --> 00:05:57,810
There's a line where you can take a KTX

171
00:05:57,810 --> 00:06:00,510
to reach Gangwon-do, the Gyeonggang Line.

172
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:04,043
You can get to Gangwon-do from Seoul in 1.5 hours.

173
00:06:04,043 --> 00:06:06,043
- That's great. / - The line begins at Seoul Station.

174
00:06:06,043 --> 00:06:08,243
It passes by Yangpyeong in Gyeonggi-do,

175
00:06:08,243 --> 00:06:11,177
Pyeongchang, and Gangneung is the last station.

176
00:06:11,177 --> 00:06:13,010
We took the KTX there.

177
00:06:13,010 --> 00:06:14,377
- That's so convenient. / - So comfortable.

178
00:06:14,377 --> 00:06:16,477
- So good. / - In the past when we drove...

179
00:06:16,477 --> 00:06:18,643
- It took 8 hours to Gangwon-do. / - That's right.

180
00:06:18,643 --> 00:06:21,043
On the KTX, you'll get there in the blink of an eye.

181
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:23,110
- In the blink of an eye... / - Blink and you're there.

182
00:06:23,543 --> 00:06:25,043
- So quick. / - It took 1 hour and 30 minutes.

183
00:06:25,043 --> 00:06:26,143
If it takes that long to blink,

184
00:06:26,143 --> 00:06:27,010
you need to visit the hospital.

185
00:06:27,010 --> 00:06:28,010
It was so quick.

186
00:06:28,677 --> 00:06:30,043
We arrived real quick.

187
00:06:30,043 --> 00:06:31,010
- Which team should go first? / - Which one?

188
00:06:31,010 --> 00:06:33,710
Why don't we start with Pyeongchang?

189
00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:34,643
- Pyeongchang first? / - Yes, Pyeongchang.

190
00:06:34,643 --> 00:06:36,543
Let's ask the name of their tour.

191
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:37,977
We went with a cute name.

192
00:06:37,977 --> 00:06:39,310
Shout out the name.

193
00:06:39,977 --> 00:06:41,377
- Mingyu... / - And Seungkwan's...

194
00:06:41,377 --> 00:06:42,877
- BuGyu Trip. / - BuGyu Trip.

195
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:49,410
Why are we always stuck together?

196
00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:50,977
Let's show them a great chemistry.

197
00:06:50,977 --> 00:06:51,743
Please take a seat.

198
00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:54,310
(Hehe)

199
00:06:54,310 --> 00:06:55,743
(Gosh, I feel shy)

200
00:06:55,743 --> 00:06:56,843
Should we say hello first?

201
00:06:57,310 --> 00:06:58,010
Say the name.

202
00:06:58,010 --> 00:06:59,243
SEVENTEEN. Hello.

203
00:06:59,243 --> 00:07:01,843
- I'm SEVENTEEN's Mingyu. / - I'm Seungkwan.

204
00:07:01,843 --> 00:07:02,677
It's nice to meet you.

205
00:07:03,810 --> 00:07:06,243
(SEVENTEEN is a nice group of 13 male singers)

206
00:07:08,043 --> 00:07:09,243
Haven't seen this in a while.

207
00:07:10,043 --> 00:07:12,910
(Seungkwan, cute main vocalist)

208
00:07:15,277 --> 00:07:17,477
(Let us introduce you to these two)

209
00:07:17,943 --> 00:07:20,277
You shouldn't eat potato rice cake when it's hot.

210
00:07:20,277 --> 00:07:21,910
Wait till it cools

211
00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:23,677
and it gets really nice and chewy.

212
00:07:25,043 --> 00:07:26,210
Nice and sticky.

213
00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:27,710
(He has an expressive face)

214
00:07:28,177 --> 00:07:30,777
You add the rice to the soup...

215
00:07:30,777 --> 00:07:32,110
You're not going to come even after watching this?

216
00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:34,177
He's good with reactions.

217
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:35,777
- They're both so funny. / - Don't miss out.

218
00:07:35,777 --> 00:07:37,243
He's rich with reactions.

219
00:07:39,543 --> 00:07:41,943
We traveled passionately.

220
00:07:41,943 --> 00:07:44,743
- A day trip to Gangwon-do. / - Yes.

221
00:07:44,743 --> 00:07:45,977
With a $100 budget.

222
00:07:45,977 --> 00:07:48,610
We must come up with a plan

223
00:07:48,610 --> 00:07:49,677
to thoroughly enjoy the trip.

224
00:07:49,677 --> 00:07:51,843
I went there for a shoot.

225
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:54,843
I went to Pyeongchang.

226
00:07:54,843 --> 00:07:56,543
There's a trout festival.

227
00:07:56,543 --> 00:07:58,810
You have to make a hole in the ice.

228
00:07:58,810 --> 00:08:01,110
- Put a small fishing rod into the hole. / - Right.

229
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:02,143
- That's fun. / - Wasn't it cold?

230
00:08:02,143 --> 00:08:03,443
- It's fun. / - I thought I was going to die.

231
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:06,510
- I survived. / - Then we don't recommend it.

232
00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:08,177
- Not recommended. / - That's right but...

233
00:08:08,177 --> 00:08:09,543
So we don't recommend it.

234
00:08:09,543 --> 00:08:10,610
No, I mean we do.

235
00:08:10,610 --> 00:08:11,510
Okay.

236
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:13,443
- It's... / - It's really cold in Korea now.

237
00:08:13,443 --> 00:08:14,710
- I know it's cold. / - Okay.

238
00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:17,543
(It seems like he did enjoy the festival)

239
00:08:17,543 --> 00:08:18,443
My pressed with my hands...

240
00:08:18,443 --> 00:08:21,010
You know that chewy feeling, right?

241
00:08:21,010 --> 00:08:22,410
- Seeing how plump it is? / - Yeah.

242
00:08:22,410 --> 00:08:24,143
I really wanted to eat it,

243
00:08:24,143 --> 00:08:25,943
but I couldn't.

244
00:08:25,943 --> 00:08:29,643
We can treat that as an idea for the trip.

245
00:08:29,643 --> 00:08:31,243
But it might be too cold.

246
00:08:32,477 --> 00:08:33,910
Then first of all,

247
00:08:33,910 --> 00:08:36,043
when I search for Gangwon-do, I get...

248
00:08:36,043 --> 00:08:37,077
Weather.

249
00:08:37,077 --> 00:08:38,343
Places to visit.

250
00:08:38,343 --> 00:08:40,177
And this term pops up right away.

251
00:08:42,010 --> 00:08:44,310
- Just as you said... / - This is what I'm talking about.

252
00:08:44,310 --> 00:08:46,443
- Pyeongchang Trout Festival. / - Trout Festival.

253
00:08:46,443 --> 00:08:47,977
- The hole was this big. / - He kept talking about it.

254
00:08:47,977 --> 00:08:49,843
- There he goes again. / - He mentioned it so much.

255
00:08:49,843 --> 00:08:51,377
He must love trout.

256
00:08:51,377 --> 00:08:53,877
You must taste it.

257
00:08:53,877 --> 00:08:55,410
When you eat it, it's all over.

258
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:58,077
- You must try it. / - There are many fish festivals.

259
00:08:58,277 --> 00:08:59,943
Inje Icefish Festival.

260
00:08:59,943 --> 00:09:01,443
Hwacheon Masu Salmon Festival.

261
00:09:01,443 --> 00:09:02,577
- That's a famous festival. / - Trout Festival.

262
00:09:02,577 --> 00:09:05,443
Do you know another famous dish in Pyeongchang?

263
00:09:05,443 --> 00:09:06,143
What is it?

264
00:09:06,143 --> 00:09:07,677
Buckwheat is famous.

265
00:09:07,677 --> 00:09:09,877
Buckwheat... Gosh, there was a name for that.

266
00:09:09,877 --> 00:09:10,810
There's a poem.

267
00:09:10,810 --> 00:09:12,343
It's not a poem. It's a novel.

268
00:09:12,343 --> 00:09:14,243
There's a street full of it.

269
00:09:14,243 --> 00:09:15,943
When you go there,

270
00:09:15,943 --> 00:09:17,343
you must try buckwheat noodles

271
00:09:17,343 --> 00:09:18,077
and buckwheat crepe.

272
00:09:18,077 --> 00:09:19,377
I want to eat buckwheat noodles.

273
00:09:19,377 --> 00:09:20,877
- We should try that activity. / - What?

274
00:09:20,877 --> 00:09:23,243
We should experience the PyeongChang Olympics.

275
00:09:23,243 --> 00:09:24,710
What's really interesting is that

276
00:09:24,710 --> 00:09:25,910
when you go to Pyeongchang now,

277
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:27,943
the stadiums are being built.

278
00:09:29,210 --> 00:09:30,143
That's amazing.

279
00:09:30,143 --> 00:09:31,510
Look up Pyeongchang too.

280
00:09:33,043 --> 00:09:33,477
This is it.

281
00:09:33,477 --> 00:09:37,843
So the city we will visit in Gangwon-do is...

282
00:09:37,843 --> 00:09:39,110
Pick one.

283
00:09:40,077 --> 00:09:41,243
(Should I announce it?)

284
00:09:43,643 --> 00:09:44,543
Pyeongchang.

285
00:09:45,577 --> 00:09:46,810
- Pyeongchang. / - Pyeongchang.

286
00:09:47,443 --> 00:09:49,410
- That was similar. / - It was similar.

287
00:09:49,410 --> 00:09:51,210
- It was similar. / - I love you, production crew!

288
00:09:51,210 --> 00:09:52,710
- Pyeongchang. / - It's right.

289
00:09:52,710 --> 00:09:54,510
It is a bit similar.

290
00:09:56,043 --> 00:09:58,543
Now, it's the Olympic season in Pyeongchang.

291
00:09:58,543 --> 00:10:01,310
- We won't have another chance. / - Right.

292
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:03,210
This is amazing.

293
00:10:03,210 --> 00:10:04,543
This is so fun.

294
00:10:04,543 --> 00:10:07,077
This is a trip you can only take in winter.

295
00:10:07,077 --> 00:10:08,010
What is that?

296
00:10:08,010 --> 00:10:09,943
- What is this? / - That's what I did.

297
00:10:09,943 --> 00:10:11,410
(Let's go to Pyeongchang!)

298
00:10:13,010 --> 00:10:13,610
- That looks fun. / - You caught that?

299
00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:14,977
That'd be awesome if you did.

300
00:10:14,977 --> 00:10:16,643
Then how can we get there?

301
00:10:17,010 --> 00:10:18,210
There it is.

302
00:10:19,077 --> 00:10:21,610
KTX Gyeonggang Line.

303
00:10:21,610 --> 00:10:23,010
Okay.

304
00:10:23,010 --> 00:10:26,043
We head off at 8:01.

305
00:10:26,877 --> 00:10:29,643
- It's really pretty there. / - It is.

306
00:10:29,643 --> 00:10:31,710
Let's have a blast

307
00:10:31,710 --> 00:10:33,143
in Pyeongchang.

308
00:10:33,143 --> 00:10:35,010
I think it'll be so much fun.

309
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:36,443
For real.

310
00:10:40,043 --> 00:10:41,943
(Seoul Station, 7:45 a.m.)

311
00:10:43,077 --> 00:10:44,977
- Finally. / - Yes.

312
00:10:44,977 --> 00:10:47,410
- We've arrived at Seoul Station. / - Right.

313
00:10:47,410 --> 00:10:49,043
Our travel expenses...

314
00:10:49,043 --> 00:10:49,710
Are you giving it to us now?

315
00:10:49,710 --> 00:10:52,310
- Battle Trip. / - It's all prepared.

316
00:10:52,310 --> 00:10:54,143
We'll head inside

317
00:10:54,143 --> 00:10:56,310
Seoul Station now.

318
00:10:56,310 --> 00:10:57,410
Let's go!

319
00:10:57,410 --> 00:10:58,310
How do we do this?

320
00:10:58,310 --> 00:10:59,843
Let's go and say BuGyu Trip.

321
00:10:59,843 --> 00:11:01,243
Let's go, BuGyu Trip?

322
00:11:02,343 --> 00:11:04,377
- Seoul Station. / - Let's head inside Seoul Station.

323
00:11:04,377 --> 00:11:05,177
3, 4.

324
00:11:05,177 --> 00:11:07,177
Let's go. BuGyu, BuGyu!

325
00:11:08,410 --> 00:11:09,543
So cute.

326
00:11:10,210 --> 00:11:11,677
- Let's go. / - That's the best time.

327
00:11:11,677 --> 00:11:12,410
It's the most exciting...

328
00:11:12,410 --> 00:11:14,110
- When you head to the train. / - You're right.

329
00:11:14,110 --> 00:11:15,977
You need to be a little tired to enjoy the trip.

330
00:11:15,977 --> 00:11:17,210
Of course.

331
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:19,043
"Gyeonggang Line."

332
00:11:19,043 --> 00:11:20,677
"The fastest way to the Olympics."

333
00:11:21,610 --> 00:11:22,810
Platform 14.

334
00:11:24,810 --> 00:11:25,977
Here we go.

335
00:11:25,977 --> 00:11:27,177
We're on the train.

336
00:11:28,710 --> 00:11:30,477
To Pyeongchang.

337
00:11:31,110 --> 00:11:32,310
We're departing.

338
00:11:34,010 --> 00:11:36,377
I'm really happy today. I'm so excited.

339
00:11:36,377 --> 00:11:37,677
I can't wait. Seriously.

340
00:11:40,143 --> 00:11:41,843
If it takes 1 hour and 30 minutes,

341
00:11:41,843 --> 00:11:43,477
you don't have time to sleep.

342
00:11:43,477 --> 00:11:44,577
- That's a short trip. / - It's fast.

343
00:11:44,577 --> 00:11:46,310
You can just take a nap.

344
00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:47,143
My gosh, what's that?

345
00:11:48,143 --> 00:11:49,543
We have to take photos of this.

346
00:11:49,543 --> 00:11:50,377
Is it all frozen?

347
00:11:52,043 --> 00:11:53,110
Where are we?

348
00:11:53,743 --> 00:11:55,210
It feels like a movie.

349
00:11:56,777 --> 00:11:59,343
Let's decide on what we're going to eat

350
00:11:59,343 --> 00:12:01,010
when we arrive at Hyoseok Cultural Village.

351
00:12:01,010 --> 00:12:03,443
They serve buckwheat noodles,

352
00:12:03,443 --> 00:12:05,943
buckwheat crepe, buckwheat fritters. Everything.

353
00:12:05,943 --> 00:12:07,510
Okay. We should go there then.

354
00:12:08,777 --> 00:12:10,010
This is so pretty.

355
00:12:10,010 --> 00:12:12,310
The presentation

356
00:12:12,310 --> 00:12:13,110
is just top notch.

357
00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:14,643
And the price is reasonable.

358
00:12:15,977 --> 00:12:17,343
This station is

359
00:12:17,343 --> 00:12:20,710
Pyeongchang. Pyeongchang.

360
00:12:20,710 --> 00:12:21,810
Get up.

361
00:12:23,443 --> 00:12:24,977
We have arrived.

362
00:12:25,977 --> 00:12:27,643
It snowed a lot here.

363
00:12:27,643 --> 00:12:30,077
I'll explain Pyeongchang Station.

364
00:12:30,077 --> 00:12:33,043
It's located at the altitude of 660m.

365
00:12:33,043 --> 00:12:34,377
- It is? / - Yes.

366
00:12:34,377 --> 00:12:35,843
When you arrive at the station,

367
00:12:35,843 --> 00:12:38,343
you expect to see the stadiums.

368
00:12:38,343 --> 00:12:40,043
But to go to the stadiums...

369
00:12:40,443 --> 00:12:42,577
The next station after this is closer to the stadiums.

370
00:12:42,577 --> 00:12:43,877
Is that so?

371
00:12:44,277 --> 00:12:45,277
Should we take a photo?

372
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:48,343
(Memorial photo with Soohorang and Bandabi)

373
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:50,510
1, 2, 3.

374
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:55,910
- Let's go. / - Let's go.

375
00:12:55,910 --> 00:12:59,310
When you get off at Pyeongchang Station,

376
00:12:59,310 --> 00:13:02,377
there's a bus stop right in front of the station.

377
00:13:02,377 --> 00:13:03,443
Can you see it?

378
00:13:04,177 --> 00:13:06,610
But we won't take that bus.

379
00:13:06,610 --> 00:13:08,277
We rented a car

380
00:13:08,277 --> 00:13:09,343
to get there faster.

381
00:13:09,343 --> 00:13:10,543
Really?

382
00:13:10,543 --> 00:13:11,677
It's over there.

383
00:13:11,677 --> 00:13:12,310
Is that it?

384
00:13:12,310 --> 00:13:13,410
That's the car.

385
00:13:13,410 --> 00:13:15,410
This car is going to help our trip in Pyeongchang.

386
00:13:15,810 --> 00:13:17,877
- Here's the car. / - I call shotgun.

387
00:13:18,410 --> 00:13:20,243
Mingyu is known to be a safe driver.

388
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:23,977
Mingyu gets to drive.

389
00:13:23,977 --> 00:13:25,110
I'm so excited.

390
00:13:25,110 --> 00:13:26,877
I thought Seungkwan would lead the trip,

391
00:13:26,877 --> 00:13:28,810
but Mingyu is leading.

392
00:13:28,810 --> 00:13:32,110
Let's go to Hyoseok Cultural Village.

393
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:34,077
Should we listen to some music?

394
00:13:35,410 --> 00:13:36,577
("Chococo" by Gugudan)

395
00:13:36,577 --> 00:13:37,877
(Song recommended by SEVENTEEN for winter)

396
00:13:38,843 --> 00:13:39,943
You know this, right?

397
00:13:40,277 --> 00:13:41,710
(Join in)

398
00:13:42,877 --> 00:13:45,010
(His jukebox is ready)

399
00:13:45,010 --> 00:13:47,310
The trip is more fun with friends like that.

400
00:13:47,310 --> 00:13:49,577
- You don't get sleepy while driving. / - That's right.

401
00:13:49,577 --> 00:13:51,410
That's right. It's good.

402
00:13:52,377 --> 00:13:53,843
We have to roll down the window for this.

403
00:13:53,843 --> 00:13:56,110
This song is great in both winter and summer.

404
00:13:56,110 --> 00:13:57,743
It's better in winter.

405
00:13:59,377 --> 00:14:00,977
Can you see that?

406
00:14:00,977 --> 00:14:01,843
Hyoseok Cultural Village.

407
00:14:02,710 --> 00:14:05,810
(Right now, it's a snowfield)

408
00:14:06,877 --> 00:14:08,810
This is nice.

409
00:14:09,677 --> 00:14:13,210
(Bongpyeong is the setting for Lee Hyoseok's novel)

410
00:14:13,477 --> 00:14:15,943
We're passing by Lee Hyoseok Memorial Hall.

411
00:14:17,843 --> 00:14:19,877
- We have arrived. / - That's it.

412
00:14:19,877 --> 00:14:21,777
- Let's eat. / - We're here!

413
00:14:23,243 --> 00:14:27,343
(Buckwheat noodles made in boiling water)

414
00:14:30,310 --> 00:14:32,043
This is it.

415
00:14:33,310 --> 00:14:34,010
That's...

416
00:14:34,010 --> 00:14:35,977
We went to have this right away.

417
00:14:35,977 --> 00:14:36,643
Well done.

418
00:14:36,643 --> 00:14:38,277
I can smell it from here too.

419
00:14:38,277 --> 00:14:39,043
I'm going to get spicy noodles.

420
00:14:39,043 --> 00:14:39,677
- Spicy noodles? / - Yeah.

421
00:14:39,677 --> 00:14:41,343
I want...

422
00:14:42,510 --> 00:14:43,243
Hey.

423
00:14:45,443 --> 00:14:47,077
If one has mixed...

424
00:14:47,077 --> 00:14:48,610
- The other has to have cold. / - That's right.

425
00:14:48,610 --> 00:14:50,610
We'd like one cold buckwheat noodles

426
00:14:50,610 --> 00:14:52,277
and spicy buckwheat noodles.

427
00:14:52,277 --> 00:14:53,610
One buckwheat crepe

428
00:14:53,610 --> 00:14:55,077
and potato dumplings.

429
00:14:55,077 --> 00:14:57,743
Our best dish is homemade buckwheat jelly.

430
00:14:57,743 --> 00:14:58,810
Really?

431
00:14:58,810 --> 00:15:00,243
Or boiled pork.

432
00:15:00,243 --> 00:15:01,710
- Boiled pork? / - Pork?

433
00:15:01,710 --> 00:15:02,377
It's $30?

434
00:15:02,377 --> 00:15:03,577
Alpine leek boiled pork.

435
00:15:03,577 --> 00:15:04,943
Oh, alpine leeks.

436
00:15:05,143 --> 00:15:06,677
Alpine leeks.

437
00:15:06,677 --> 00:15:07,877
- Alpine leeks! / - Oh, that.

438
00:15:07,877 --> 00:15:09,910
- Meat... / - That's the best.

439
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:10,677
How much is it?

440
00:15:10,677 --> 00:15:12,443
It's $15.

441
00:15:12,443 --> 00:15:13,910
Let's skip potato dumplings then.

442
00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:18,277
Let's skip potato dumplings or the buckwheat crepe.

443
00:15:19,477 --> 00:15:20,510
We'll skip the crepe.

444
00:15:20,510 --> 00:15:22,177
The crepe?

445
00:15:22,177 --> 00:15:23,143
We must let it go.

446
00:15:24,010 --> 00:15:24,610
- Okay, then. / - Take it out.

447
00:15:24,610 --> 00:15:26,777
One cold and one spicy noodles.

448
00:15:26,777 --> 00:15:28,943
- One potato dumplings. / - Dumplings...

449
00:15:28,943 --> 00:15:30,843
- And one alpine leek boiled pork. / - Boiled pork.

450
00:15:30,843 --> 00:15:32,610
You already spent $38.

451
00:15:32,610 --> 00:15:33,710
We didn't save money on food.

452
00:15:33,710 --> 00:15:34,877
And you shouldn't either.

453
00:15:34,877 --> 00:15:37,277
Please give us a generous portion.

454
00:15:37,277 --> 00:15:38,710
I'm sad I can't try the crepe.

455
00:15:39,477 --> 00:15:43,043
Should we say what you just said in a funny way?

456
00:15:43,043 --> 00:15:45,577
- We don't want to lose the crepe. / - Lose the crepe.

457
00:15:48,443 --> 00:15:50,743

459

Seungkwan,

465
00:16:02,143 --> 00:16:05,310
I'll take a photo as you open it.

466
00:16:05,310 --> 00:16:06,777
- You haven't looked yet, right? / - No.

467

You'll be so surprised.

1, 2, 3.

469
00:16:12,177 --> 00:16:14,577
(What do we do?)

470
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:19,210
That was a real reaction.

471
00:16:19,210 --> 00:16:20,743
It was too good.

472
00:16:21,710 --> 00:16:23,110
My eyes rolled back.

473
00:16:24,410 --> 00:16:25,743
(He's the happiest man in the world)

474
00:16:25,743 --> 00:16:27,310
I took a great photo.

475
00:16:27,577 --> 00:16:28,043
So cute.

476
00:16:28,043 --> 00:16:30,077
At the thought of eating it,

477
00:16:30,077 --> 00:16:31,810
I was entranced.

478
00:16:31,810 --> 00:16:33,677
- That's how pork is served? / - Yes.

479
00:16:37,077 --> 00:16:39,110

480
00:16:39,510 --> 00:16:40,777
I'm so happy.

481
00:16:42,177 --> 00:16:44,677
With this cabbage kimchi, it will be the best.

482
00:16:44,677 --> 00:16:45,677
You know what I mean?

483
00:16:50,210 --> 00:16:51,343
You're not going to eat rice after that?

484
00:16:52,610 --> 00:16:54,043
- Try this. / - But it looks really delicious.

485
00:16:54,743 --> 00:16:56,177
It's full of charm.

486
00:16:57,310 --> 00:16:58,810
They seem so friendly.

487
00:16:58,810 --> 00:17:00,210
It was so hot.

488
00:17:00,710 --> 00:17:02,177

It's really chewy.

491

The dumpling skin is made of potato rice cake.

492

It's really chewy.

493
00:17:17,843 --> 00:17:18,543
Everyone.

494
00:17:19,710 --> 00:17:20,777
You're not going to visit?

495
00:17:21,710 --> 00:17:23,343
You're not going to come even after watching this?

496
00:17:25,277 --> 00:17:27,243
The cold and spicy buckwheat noodles

497
00:17:27,243 --> 00:17:28,543
are getting ready to enter.

498
00:17:29,277 --> 00:17:30,810
We're really looking forward

499
00:17:30,810 --> 00:17:32,177
to their performances this year.

500
00:17:32,177 --> 00:17:35,843
From looking at it here...

501
00:17:35,843 --> 00:17:39,210
We can't tell which one's which yet.

502
00:17:39,210 --> 00:17:41,643
They're heading towards us now.

503
00:17:41,643 --> 00:17:44,177

Thank you.

00:17:52,043 --> 00:17:53,477
(The visuals really shock him)

509
00:17:53,477 --> 00:17:58,043
I really want to praise something.

510
00:17:58,043 --> 00:18:01,043
It's the ice in this bowl.

511
00:18:01,043 --> 00:18:02,710
- You know what it is, right? / - You know, don't you?

512
00:18:02,710 --> 00:18:03,910
You must take a look.

513
00:18:03,910 --> 00:18:07,110
It's the perfect size that will melt in my mouth.

514
00:18:08,077 --> 00:18:09,977
I have to put aside the boiled egg for now.

515
00:18:09,977 --> 00:18:10,977
Take it out...

516
00:18:14,343 --> 00:18:15,910
Wow...

517
00:18:15,910 --> 00:18:17,977
There's a flower.

518
00:18:17,977 --> 00:18:19,410
There's a flower in the broth.

519
00:18:19,410 --> 00:18:20,077
There's a flower?

520
00:18:20,077 --> 00:18:21,710
I can smell the flower.

521
00:18:23,643 --> 00:18:25,177
- You can smell the flower, right? / - You're right.

522
00:18:25,177 --> 00:18:26,443
It smells like the flower.

523
00:18:26,443 --> 00:18:27,577
It smells like the flower.

524
00:18:27,577 --> 00:18:29,177
The taste of the sprouts.

525
00:18:29,177 --> 00:18:30,310
It's like a flower.

526
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:32,910
Compared to male guests who starred on Battle Trip,

527
00:18:32,910 --> 00:18:35,343
you're the best at describing the tastes of food.

528
00:18:35,343 --> 00:18:36,510
They'd sell out on

529
00:18:36,510 --> 00:18:38,510
the home shopping network.

530
00:18:39,177 --> 00:18:40,943
Sure. I'll start accepting calls.

531
00:18:42,477 --> 00:18:44,077
I have buckwheat sprouts.

532
00:18:44,877 --> 00:18:46,877
Let me mix the sprouts.

533
00:18:48,610 --> 00:18:50,743
When you look at the spicy noodles now...

534
00:18:51,777 --> 00:18:53,210
The colors are very pretty.

535
00:18:53,210 --> 00:18:55,510
- It's like mixing bibimbap. / - My mouth is watering.

536
00:18:55,510 --> 00:18:57,943
Amazing. A bit of broth...

537
00:18:57,943 --> 00:18:59,343
- It makes it moist. / - Strangely.

538
00:18:59,343 --> 00:19:01,377
Buckwheat dishes from Gangwon-do...

539
00:19:01,377 --> 00:19:03,177
- Are different to Seoul. / - They are.

540
00:19:04,877 --> 00:19:06,577
This is it.

541
00:19:07,643 --> 00:19:08,743
All done.

542
00:19:10,443 --> 00:19:12,377
(Slurping)

543
00:19:12,810 --> 00:19:14,343
How appetizing.

544
00:19:16,310 --> 00:19:17,610
This is how people ought to eat.

545
00:19:18,743 --> 00:19:20,710
I'll add a pork slice.

546
00:19:21,377 --> 00:19:22,977
- Then some alpine leeks. / - That's the way.

547
00:19:22,977 --> 00:19:24,910
You have to eat the pork with the noodles.

548
00:19:25,777 --> 00:19:27,177
He knows how to enjoy food.

549
00:19:27,177 --> 00:19:28,277
I bet it was so delicious.

550
00:19:28,277 --> 00:19:29,543
- Like so... / - They eat well.

551
00:19:35,010 --> 00:19:37,177
After eating some, I'll add the broth.

552
00:19:37,677 --> 00:19:39,810
My gosh, he knows how to eat.

553
00:19:39,810 --> 00:19:40,977
Just enough to cover the noodles.

554
00:19:44,143 --> 00:19:45,810
(He does something else)

555
00:19:45,943 --> 00:19:47,310
You know what this is, right?

556
00:19:48,977 --> 00:19:50,277
I know this. We should film this.

557
00:19:51,110 --> 00:19:52,243
You know what it is, right?

558
00:19:52,243 --> 00:19:53,777
You put the broth in the egg.

559
00:19:53,777 --> 00:19:56,210
- The sauce... / - This is it.

560
00:19:56,210 --> 00:19:57,310
And on top of the egg...

561
00:19:59,410 --> 00:20:00,943
This is the best bite.

562
00:20:02,510 --> 00:20:03,543
Last bite.

563
00:20:04,043 --> 00:20:06,210
You know how to enjoy food, don't you?

564
00:20:08,743 --> 00:20:09,877
Buckwheat noodles are...

565
00:20:09,877 --> 00:20:11,843
- Very nice! / - Very nice!

566
00:20:14,877 --> 00:20:17,010
They really finished the noodles and the rice.

567
00:20:17,010 --> 00:20:18,977
We licked the plates clean.

568
00:20:18,977 --> 00:20:20,143
That's how people ought to eat.

569
00:20:20,143 --> 00:20:22,443
- You thoroughly enjoyed the food. / - Right.

570
00:20:23,077 --> 00:20:24,443
(Mingyu and Seungkwan's day trip)

571
00:20:24,443 --> 00:20:27,577
(Pyeongchang Trout Festival)

572
00:20:28,577 --> 00:20:29,877
Let's go.

573
00:20:30,077 --> 00:20:33,477
As someone who's gone trout fishing,

574
00:20:33,477 --> 00:20:35,277
fishing skills aren't important.

575
00:20:35,277 --> 00:20:36,510
You just need to wait.

576
00:20:36,510 --> 00:20:38,677
All you need to do is pull out after waiting.

577
00:20:39,710 --> 00:20:42,077
(Pyeongchang Trout Festival, till February 25th)

578
00:20:43,143 --> 00:20:45,910
(A winter festival for people of all ages)

579
00:20:46,077 --> 00:20:47,477
They're this small.

580
00:20:47,477 --> 00:20:48,077
Do they pop out of here?

581
00:20:48,077 --> 00:20:50,177
You get a fish this big.

582
00:20:53,143 --> 00:20:55,077
That looks like fun.

583
00:20:55,077 --> 00:20:57,677
Your fishing skill doesn't matter here.

584
00:20:57,677 --> 00:20:59,410
- Mingyu. / - And Seungkwan's...

585
00:20:59,410 --> 00:21:00,543
BuGyu Trip.

586
00:21:04,443 --> 00:21:06,110
- So many people. / - So many.

587
00:21:08,043 --> 00:21:08,943
Let's go.

588
00:21:08,943 --> 00:21:11,010
We'll go inside.

589
00:21:11,910 --> 00:21:13,810
- 2 adults. / - For ice fishing please.

590
00:21:13,810 --> 00:21:15,110
2 tickets.

591
00:21:15,110 --> 00:21:17,710
That'll be $26 for 2 adults.

592
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:18,677
$26.

593
00:21:18,677 --> 00:21:19,777
- That's a lot. / - You've spent a lot.

594
00:21:19,777 --> 00:21:21,577
We felt a bit worried then.

595
00:21:21,577 --> 00:21:23,310
- You already spent half. / - With $26...

596
00:21:23,310 --> 00:21:24,877
Can you take however many fish you want?

597
00:21:24,877 --> 00:21:26,810
Each person can take two fish home.

598
00:21:26,810 --> 00:21:28,577
- Someone has to clean the fish. / - Yes.

599
00:21:28,577 --> 00:21:29,810
We don't need chairs or nets.

600
00:21:29,810 --> 00:21:31,277
We just need fishing rods.

601
00:21:31,277 --> 00:21:32,343
- Just fishing rods? / - Yeah.

602
00:21:33,077 --> 00:21:34,210
It's easy to catch with these too, right?

603
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:36,377
Skilled people catch a lot of fish with this too.

604
00:21:37,210 --> 00:21:39,610
It's all up to the individual.

605
00:21:39,843 --> 00:21:42,077
(Who will catch the most fish?)

606
00:21:43,610 --> 00:21:45,343
I'll catch them with passion.

607
00:21:46,010 --> 00:21:48,143
You can see them swimming through here.

608
00:21:50,210 --> 00:21:51,943
Mingyu, which spot is good?

609
00:21:51,943 --> 00:21:52,643
Here?

610
00:21:54,410 --> 00:21:57,543
- Here? / - There are a few hundred holes.

611
00:21:57,543 --> 00:21:58,110
There are holes.

612
00:21:58,110 --> 00:21:59,843
You just choose a spot and fish.

613
00:21:59,843 --> 00:22:01,443
You should pick a good spot.

614
00:22:01,443 --> 00:22:02,610
- Yes, you should. / - Right.

615
00:22:03,977 --> 00:22:05,310
I'll catch it for you.

616
00:22:10,877 --> 00:22:12,810
I'm going to catch it no matter what.

617
00:22:14,043 --> 00:22:16,010
(Seungkwan can't stay put)

618
00:22:17,610 --> 00:22:18,910
(Looking around)

619
00:22:19,477 --> 00:22:22,243
Mingyu, you have to keep moving it like this.

620
00:22:24,977 --> 00:22:26,110
What brings you here?

621
00:22:28,510 --> 00:22:30,310
Who caught these? You?

622
00:22:30,977 --> 00:22:31,510
My godfather did.

623
00:22:31,510 --> 00:22:33,043
Your godfather?

624
00:22:34,077 --> 00:22:36,243
(Seungkwan approaches the godfather)

625
00:22:38,243 --> 00:22:40,277
Hello. How can I catch trout?

626
00:22:41,077 --> 00:22:42,410
Should I just keep waiting?

627
00:22:42,410 --> 00:22:44,443
These trout...

628
00:22:45,577 --> 00:22:48,010
They react to moving bait.

629
00:22:48,010 --> 00:22:49,910
You have to keep doing this.

630
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:52,777
You have to keep moving this so they bite.

631
00:22:52,777 --> 00:22:54,910
People who come here leisurely and catch fish.

632
00:22:55,443 --> 00:22:57,877
- Mingyu, it's all about waiting. / - You need to move.

633
00:22:57,877 --> 00:22:59,077
I think...

634
00:22:59,077 --> 00:23:00,043
He learned a skill.

635
00:23:00,043 --> 00:23:01,510
It's not this.

636
00:23:01,510 --> 00:23:02,543
It's like this.

637
00:23:03,377 --> 00:23:04,310
Move it back and forth.

638
00:23:04,310 --> 00:23:06,377
Because they react to moving bait.

639
00:23:06,377 --> 00:23:07,643
It's not moving right now.

640
00:23:07,643 --> 00:23:09,110
(Why isn't it moving?)

641
00:23:09,943 --> 00:23:11,943
- This is how you do it. / - It's hard.

642
00:23:12,610 --> 00:23:14,010
They need to catch it.

643
00:23:14,610 --> 00:23:16,143
I'm sure they'll bite, right?

644
00:23:16,143 --> 00:23:18,043
They must catch it.

645
00:23:18,043 --> 00:23:19,610
How did you catch it last time?

646
00:23:19,610 --> 00:23:20,977
I don't know.

647
00:23:20,977 --> 00:23:22,943
How did I do it? I don't think I can do it this time.

648
00:23:25,777 --> 00:23:27,677
Please, please...

649
00:23:27,677 --> 00:23:30,910
- You caught one last time, right? / - I did.

650
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:32,977
I think that's what he wanted to look like.

651
00:23:32,977 --> 00:23:34,610
I didn't get to eat that last time.

652
00:23:36,743 --> 00:23:39,043
I really want to try raw trout.

653
00:23:41,110 --> 00:23:42,777
(Determined)

654
00:23:43,710 --> 00:23:46,177
(Dear Almighty God, please let me catch a trout)

655
00:23:46,577 --> 00:23:48,843
It'll come true if we're desperate.

656
00:23:50,110 --> 00:23:52,977
(He prays desperately in one spot)

657
00:23:54,610 --> 00:23:55,843
He looks anxious.

658
00:23:57,310 --> 00:23:59,110
His knees must be freezing.

659
00:24:05,577 --> 00:24:07,043
I felt upset.

660
00:24:07,443 --> 00:24:09,210
- Someone next to us caught one. / - Right.

661
00:24:09,210 --> 00:24:10,910
They caught one from the spot I picked before.

662
00:24:10,910 --> 00:24:12,210
They caught one.

663
00:24:14,043 --> 00:24:15,910
(I want to catch one too)

664
00:24:17,710 --> 00:24:19,477
(Laughing)

665
00:24:20,343 --> 00:24:23,077
They spent so much money here.

666
00:24:23,077 --> 00:24:24,877
- So they have to catch one. / - We had to.

667
00:24:27,843 --> 00:24:29,677
(He turns and sees)

668
00:24:29,677 --> 00:24:33,410
Everyone here is like me.

669
00:24:33,410 --> 00:24:34,477
They're out of it.

670
00:24:35,710 --> 00:24:36,810
Everyone is fishing like this.

671
00:24:38,643 --> 00:24:39,343
Because it's cold.

672
00:24:39,343 --> 00:24:41,043
It's not a festival.

673
00:24:41,043 --> 00:24:41,910
Look at him.

674
00:24:41,910 --> 00:24:43,010
Look at his face.

675
00:24:43,010 --> 00:24:44,243
Look at him.

676
00:24:44,243 --> 00:24:45,243
- They're fishing but... / - Have you caught one?

677
00:24:45,243 --> 00:24:46,643
- Yes. / - My brother did.

678
00:24:46,643 --> 00:24:47,810
Did you catch one?

679
00:24:47,810 --> 00:24:49,177
That's awesome.

680
00:24:49,177 --> 00:24:50,377
You caught two?

681
00:24:50,377 --> 00:24:51,643
Seungkwan, stay here.

682
00:24:52,510 --> 00:24:53,143
I'll be back.

683
00:24:53,143 --> 00:24:54,077
Where are you going?

684
00:24:54,077 --> 00:24:55,043
Let's go.

685
00:24:56,210 --> 00:24:59,243
(Firing it up for the last time)

686
00:24:59,243 --> 00:25:03,477
(He checks different holes)

687
00:25:05,443 --> 00:25:06,610
He caught one.

688
00:25:08,010 --> 00:25:09,077
Let's just go.

689
00:25:11,243 --> 00:25:12,977
(Right then)

690
00:25:14,043 --> 00:25:15,010
You scared me.

691
00:25:15,143 --> 00:25:16,143
You scared me.

692
00:25:16,143 --> 00:25:16,577
He caught it?

693
00:25:16,577 --> 00:25:17,943
This is for me?

694
00:25:17,943 --> 00:25:18,643
No.

695
00:25:18,643 --> 00:25:19,443
Why not?

696
00:25:19,443 --> 00:25:21,010
You caught it.

697
00:25:21,810 --> 00:25:22,677
I'll give it to you.

698
00:25:22,677 --> 00:25:23,343
You will?

699
00:25:23,343 --> 00:25:24,277
Are you giving this to us?

700
00:25:24,277 --> 00:25:25,977
Yeah, he is.

701
00:25:25,977 --> 00:25:28,510
- Thank you. We got one thanks to you. / - So nice.

702
00:25:28,510 --> 00:25:29,410
What's your name?

703
00:25:30,077 --> 00:25:30,910
Hong Yurae.

704
00:25:30,910 --> 00:25:32,543
Hong Yurae. That's right.

705
00:25:32,543 --> 00:25:32,677
Ready, go.

706
00:25:32,677 --> 00:25:34,177
Mom and dad, I love you.

707
00:25:34,177 --> 00:25:37,210
Mom and dad, I love you. So cute.

708
00:25:37,210 --> 00:25:38,877
Thank you.

709
00:25:38,877 --> 00:25:40,143
I won't forget your kindness.

710
00:25:42,177 --> 00:25:43,310
Wait a minute.

711
00:25:43,977 --> 00:25:46,210
(Making such a fuss)

712
00:25:46,810 --> 00:25:47,543
Put it down.

713
00:25:47,543 --> 00:25:48,577
I really can't do this.

714
00:25:49,443 --> 00:25:50,777
I'll do it. I'll do it.

715
00:25:50,777 --> 00:25:52,910
It's good thing you can only take two.

716
00:25:52,910 --> 00:25:55,710
So you can catch them and share.

717
00:25:58,377 --> 00:26:00,077
Also, with one trout,

718
00:26:00,077 --> 00:26:01,910
3 or 4 people can eat their fill.

719
00:26:01,910 --> 00:26:02,643
Seriously.

720
00:26:02,643 --> 00:26:04,377
- That's the place. / - We're here.

721
00:26:04,377 --> 00:26:05,010
It's tough.

722
00:26:05,010 --> 00:26:06,410
That's costly too.

723
00:26:06,943 --> 00:26:09,477
(The trout you catch gets baked in a firewood oven)

724
00:26:10,077 --> 00:26:11,310
It's a baked trout.

725
00:26:11,777 --> 00:26:12,677
That looks good.

726
00:26:12,677 --> 00:26:14,477
Are you going to miss that?

727
00:26:15,310 --> 00:26:16,243
You can't miss that.

728
00:26:16,577 --> 00:26:18,010
You're going to miss that?

729
00:26:18,843 --> 00:26:19,477
How do you want it?

730
00:26:19,477 --> 00:26:20,410
Raw fish.

731
00:26:21,243 --> 00:26:23,543
Bring this back when you come to pick it up.

732
00:26:23,543 --> 00:26:24,743
If you catch two fish...

733
00:26:24,743 --> 00:26:27,543
- You can have one baked and one raw. / - Right.

734
00:26:27,543 --> 00:26:30,010
- We spent too much money here. / - We did.

735
00:26:30,010 --> 00:26:31,543
$6 for fishing rods.

736
00:26:31,543 --> 00:26:33,410
No. 1065.

737
00:26:33,410 --> 00:26:34,110
Go.

738
00:26:34,110 --> 00:26:35,177
No. 1065.

739
00:26:35,177 --> 00:26:35,910
Go.

740
00:26:37,343 --> 00:26:38,743
(Excited)

741
00:26:40,177 --> 00:26:41,510
Thank you.

742
00:26:41,510 --> 00:26:42,543
Enjoy.

743
00:26:42,543 --> 00:26:43,643
Thank you.

744
00:26:43,643 --> 00:26:44,943
Seungkwan,

745
00:26:44,943 --> 00:26:45,843
how much money do we have left?

746
00:26:46,743 --> 00:26:48,943
We spent $3 on filleting the fish.

747
00:26:48,943 --> 00:26:51,743
The sauce is $2. So we spent another $5.

748
00:26:55,810 --> 00:26:58,743
We spent $37 on fishing.

749
00:26:58,843 --> 00:27:01,377
So this is worth $37.

750
00:27:01,543 --> 00:27:03,110
This is $37.

751
00:27:03,343 --> 00:27:06,177
- You didn't order vegetables to save money? / - Right.

752
00:27:07,010 --> 00:27:08,577
$100...

753
00:27:12,043 --> 00:27:13,377
(The fish makes them forget about money)

754
00:27:13,377 --> 00:27:14,577
Finally.

755
00:27:15,277 --> 00:27:16,543
The visuals.

756
00:27:17,143 --> 00:27:18,310
It's the best, everyone.

757
00:27:24,610 --> 00:27:24,843
The best.

758
00:27:24,843 --> 00:27:28,310
That was the least fishy raw fish I've ever had.

759
00:27:28,310 --> 00:27:30,277
I thought it'd taste fishy

760
00:27:30,277 --> 00:27:31,577
but it wasn't.

761
00:27:32,810 --> 00:27:35,777
It tastes a little bit like salmon

762
00:27:35,777 --> 00:27:37,210
but it's firmer.

763
00:27:37,210 --> 00:27:40,210
Trout is in season in winter.

764
00:27:40,777 --> 00:27:42,377
It's chewy in winter.

765
00:27:42,377 --> 00:27:44,477
It's fatty and tender.

766
00:27:46,543 --> 00:27:47,577
Give one to the camera director.

767
00:27:47,577 --> 00:27:48,577
- What? / - Give him one.

768
00:27:50,810 --> 00:27:52,710
- Please try it. / - Let's share.

769
00:27:52,710 --> 00:27:54,077
Just try one.

770
00:27:54,077 --> 00:27:55,043
Here you go.

771
00:27:59,677 --> 00:28:00,877
Isn't is good?

772
00:28:01,643 --> 00:28:03,243
It's honestly good, right?

773
00:28:03,243 --> 00:28:04,243
That's what happens.

774
00:28:04,243 --> 00:28:06,677
You don't think it'd be that great but then...

775
00:28:07,377 --> 00:28:08,543
It's chewy too.

776
00:28:08,543 --> 00:28:09,777
The Pyeongchang Trout Festival is...

777
00:28:09,777 --> 00:28:11,343
- Very nice. / - Nice.

778
00:28:11,343 --> 00:28:14,010
You should go skiing or sledding in Pyeongchang.

779
00:28:14,010 --> 00:28:15,977
Right next to the trout festival...

780
00:28:15,977 --> 00:28:18,243
- There's a sledding slope. / - There is.

781
00:28:18,243 --> 00:28:19,910
If you don't want to fish, you can go there.

782
00:28:19,910 --> 00:28:20,610
You can go sledding.

783
00:28:20,610 --> 00:28:22,577
When I think of Gangwon-do,

784
00:28:22,577 --> 00:28:23,943
I think of mountains.

785
00:28:23,943 --> 00:28:25,577
- That's right. / - I want to ski...

786
00:28:25,577 --> 00:28:28,143
Or go sledding.

787
00:28:28,143 --> 00:28:29,010
Seungkwan, do you know...

788
00:28:29,010 --> 00:28:31,010
- How to ski? / - I'm not very good at skiing.

789
00:28:31,010 --> 00:28:32,010
Don't you snowboard?

790
00:28:32,010 --> 00:28:32,943
No, I ski but...

791
00:28:32,943 --> 00:28:35,810
How about learning how to ski on Battle Trip?

792
00:28:35,977 --> 00:28:37,077
(Thinking)

793
00:28:37,943 --> 00:28:39,210
I need to think about this.

794
00:28:39,210 --> 00:28:42,210
I think it'd be nice

795
00:28:42,210 --> 00:28:44,277
to experience one of the Olympic sports.

796
00:28:44,810 --> 00:28:47,443
(For Seungkwan who can't ski or board)

797
00:28:50,210 --> 00:28:50,910
This is it.

798
00:28:50,910 --> 00:28:51,910
What's this?

799
00:28:51,910 --> 00:28:52,910
This? I see.

800
00:28:52,910 --> 00:28:55,043
You can ride a virtual reality bobsleigh.

801
00:28:55,043 --> 00:28:58,077
You can ride it at 2, 3, and 4 p.m.

802
00:29:02,110 --> 00:29:05,410
(It's a winter wonderland outside)

803
00:29:06,477 --> 00:29:08,010
The weather is great today.

804
00:29:08,843 --> 00:29:10,510
(Who am I talking to?)

805
00:29:10,743 --> 00:29:13,010
He expended his energy too quick.

806
00:29:13,010 --> 00:29:15,010
Now that's he's eaten...

807
00:29:15,010 --> 00:29:16,610
He spent too much energy on fishing.

808
00:29:16,610 --> 00:29:18,777
He's become a trout.

809
00:29:18,977 --> 00:29:20,777
The face of a freshly caught trout.

810
00:29:23,177 --> 00:29:25,010
Yes.

811
00:29:25,010 --> 00:29:26,277
This the place.

812
00:29:26,677 --> 00:29:27,310
Is it?

813
00:29:27,310 --> 00:29:29,643
We can experience all

814
00:29:29,643 --> 00:29:31,177
the Winter Olympic sports here.

815
00:29:32,243 --> 00:29:35,210
ICT Pa...

816
00:29:35,210 --> 00:29:36,277
Pa...

817
00:29:37,410 --> 00:29:39,077
Oh, it's pa?

818
00:29:39,077 --> 00:29:39,910
Pass.

819
00:29:39,910 --> 00:29:42,610
There are so many sports in Winter Olympics.

820
00:29:42,610 --> 00:29:45,477
All the snow sports that are

821
00:29:45,477 --> 00:29:46,543
in PyeongChang Olympics...

822
00:29:46,543 --> 00:29:48,577
- Not the ones on ice. / - No ice.

823
00:29:48,577 --> 00:29:50,443
You can experience them here.

824
00:29:50,443 --> 00:29:51,743
So right now...

825
00:29:51,743 --> 00:29:53,977
We'll go...

826
00:29:54,543 --> 00:29:56,043
And try it out.

827
00:29:56,043 --> 00:29:58,110
This has been Reporter Kim Mingyu from KBS.

828
00:29:58,110 --> 00:29:59,210
Let's go.

829
00:30:00,277 --> 00:30:02,543
A reporter like him would be so popular.

830
00:30:02,543 --> 00:30:04,410
(Pyeongchang ICT Center)

831
00:30:04,410 --> 00:30:07,143
(You can experience the IT that'll be used in Olympics)

832
00:30:07,143 --> 00:30:09,810
(And variety of VR simulations including Olympic sports)

833
00:30:09,810 --> 00:30:11,010
That looks like fun.

834
00:30:11,010 --> 00:30:11,443
Hello.

835
00:30:11,443 --> 00:30:13,010
I heard that you felt

836
00:30:13,010 --> 00:30:14,410
the heated passion of the winter Olympics.

837
00:30:14,410 --> 00:30:16,377
If you look above...

838
00:30:17,577 --> 00:30:18,643
That looks like so much fun.

839
00:30:18,643 --> 00:30:20,410
- Gosh. / - That looks exciting.

840
00:30:23,277 --> 00:30:23,977
That...

841
00:30:23,977 --> 00:30:25,377
What's your name?

842
00:30:26,577 --> 00:30:28,843
I'm an information robot, FURo.

843
00:30:28,843 --> 00:30:31,177
- FURo. / - FURo.

844
00:30:31,177 --> 00:30:33,177
When is PyeongChang Olympics?

845
00:30:33,877 --> 00:30:36,043
The PyeongChang Winter Olympics are

846
00:30:36,043 --> 00:30:38,443
from February 9th, 2018

847
00:30:38,443 --> 00:30:39,777
to February 25th.

848
00:30:39,777 --> 00:30:41,843
It's on for 17 days.

849
00:30:42,410 --> 00:30:45,243
17 days... That's like SEVENTEEN.

850
00:30:45,243 --> 00:30:46,843
Excuse me?

851
00:30:47,343 --> 00:30:48,210
For that time...

852
00:30:48,210 --> 00:30:49,943
- That robot was so attentive. / - The ICT...

853
00:30:49,943 --> 00:30:51,877
Excuse me?

854
00:30:51,877 --> 00:30:52,843
Hey, be quiet.

855
00:30:53,910 --> 00:30:54,943
Until then,

856
00:30:54,943 --> 00:30:57,610
the PyeongChang ICT Center is for free.

857
00:30:57,610 --> 00:30:58,943
For 17 days.

858
00:30:58,943 --> 00:31:00,110
Just like SEVENTEEN.

859
00:31:00,110 --> 00:31:01,710
I was so surprised that it was for free.

860
00:31:01,943 --> 00:31:03,243
Can we race?

861
00:31:03,243 --> 00:31:04,377
Yes, you can.

862
00:31:04,377 --> 00:31:05,810
- We can? / - We can race?

863
00:31:05,810 --> 00:31:07,010
Let's do it.

864
00:31:07,577 --> 00:31:09,577
(Seungkwan can't right snowboards)

865
00:31:09,577 --> 00:31:10,410
Yes.

866
00:31:11,177 --> 00:31:12,377
Here?

867
00:31:13,977 --> 00:31:15,310
(We'll see who's the best at sports in SEVENTEEN)

868
00:31:15,477 --> 00:31:17,143
Please look at the front.

869
00:31:17,143 --> 00:31:18,777
Do you snowboard frequently?

870
00:31:18,777 --> 00:31:19,577
No.

871
00:31:19,577 --> 00:31:20,843
You don't know how to?

872
00:31:24,510 --> 00:31:27,143
This was my first time experiencing virtual reality.

873
00:31:27,143 --> 00:31:30,810
I doubted that it would feel real.

874
00:31:33,477 --> 00:31:36,110
This is the PyeongChang Olympic snowboard stadium.

875
00:31:36,943 --> 00:31:38,410
- Next up... / - Bu Seungkwan.

876
00:31:38,410 --> 00:31:40,743
- It's Bandabi. / - 3, 2, 1.

877
00:31:40,743 --> 00:31:41,710
Here he goes.

878
00:31:42,243 --> 00:31:43,510
(Woah)

879
00:31:44,843 --> 00:31:47,110
- 3, 2, 1. / - It's Bandabi.

880
00:31:47,110 --> 00:31:48,110
Here he goes.

881
00:31:49,843 --> 00:31:52,743
Bandabi takes the lead.

882
00:31:53,110 --> 00:31:54,177
It's the first jump.

883
00:31:54,210 --> 00:31:56,643
We were actually

884
00:31:56,643 --> 00:31:58,243
competing against each other.

885
00:31:59,710 --> 00:32:01,277
Seungkwan is fast right now.

886
00:32:01,777 --> 00:32:04,010
- Four people can play this game. / - Yes.

887
00:32:04,443 --> 00:32:07,277
Snowboard cross is a competition where

888
00:32:07,277 --> 00:32:10,343
several boarders race down a course with obstacles.

889
00:32:10,343 --> 00:32:11,410
Is this right?

890
00:32:11,977 --> 00:32:13,743
- The second jump is coming up next. / - Let's go.

891
00:32:14,743 --> 00:32:15,910
The second jump.

892
00:32:15,910 --> 00:32:17,410
It really felt like jumping.

893
00:32:17,410 --> 00:32:18,643
(Their reactions are like they're on the national team)

894
00:32:21,777 --> 00:32:22,743
It's a success.

895
00:32:22,743 --> 00:32:24,043
Where are you, Seungkwan?

896
00:32:25,410 --> 00:32:26,443
This is so fun.

897
00:32:27,777 --> 00:32:28,443
You can't help it.

898
00:32:28,443 --> 00:32:30,243
He's winning.

899
00:32:31,443 --> 00:32:33,243
The fourth jump is coming up.

900
00:32:33,243 --> 00:32:34,743
Fourth jump.

901
00:32:37,810 --> 00:32:38,943
- It's a success. / - It's a success.

902
00:32:38,943 --> 00:32:39,777
Perfect landing.

903
00:32:39,777 --> 00:32:41,077
It's a perfect landing.

904
00:32:43,243 --> 00:32:44,610
Even if we go snowboarding,

905
00:32:44,610 --> 00:32:45,843
we can't ride like that.

906
00:32:45,843 --> 00:32:47,843
That'd be a great experience.

907
00:32:47,843 --> 00:32:49,277
I'm going even faster now.

908
00:32:49,877 --> 00:32:51,043
He's going faster.

909
00:32:51,043 --> 00:32:52,277
He's even faster now.

910
00:32:55,610 --> 00:32:56,977
He's going faster.

911
00:32:56,977 --> 00:32:58,077
He's even faster now.

912
00:32:58,077 --> 00:32:59,810
- The final jump is important. / - Final jump.

913
00:32:59,810 --> 00:33:01,010
The final jump!

914
00:33:04,077 --> 00:33:04,743
That looks fun.

915
00:33:06,077 --> 00:33:07,177
The thing is...

916
00:33:07,177 --> 00:33:09,943
You have to experience it for yourselves.

917
00:33:09,943 --> 00:33:11,443
- For real. / - Right.

918
00:33:11,443 --> 00:33:13,177
It's the finish line.

919
00:33:13,177 --> 00:33:14,510
- We made it. / - Made it.

920
00:33:15,343 --> 00:33:17,143
- A great record. / - VR just have to be tried.

921
00:33:18,777 --> 00:33:19,977
- I won? / - Came from behind.

922
00:33:20,410 --> 00:33:21,610
It was really close.

923
00:33:27,343 --> 00:33:28,277
I'm looking forward to the bobsleigh.

924
00:33:28,277 --> 00:33:29,177
Bungee jumping...

925
00:33:29,177 --> 00:33:30,777
The bobsleigh...

926
00:33:32,110 --> 00:33:35,810
There are guys who try bobsleigh...

927
00:33:35,910 --> 00:33:37,943
And end up crying.

928
00:33:37,943 --> 00:33:39,443
This is the bobsleigh?

929
00:33:39,443 --> 00:33:40,277
Yes.

930
00:33:41,477 --> 00:33:44,010
The VR bobsleigh we experienced

931
00:33:44,010 --> 00:33:46,843
is the same course as the official Olympics event.

932
00:33:47,443 --> 00:33:49,510
(Why am I so nervous?)

933
00:33:49,510 --> 00:33:50,277
It's too close.

934
00:33:50,277 --> 00:33:51,310
Wait a minute.

935
00:33:51,310 --> 00:33:53,410
We're going to ride in a bobsleigh that

936
00:33:53,410 --> 00:33:54,843
speeds up to 149km per hour.

937
00:33:55,110 --> 00:33:58,443
This is the PyeongChang Olympic bobsleigh stadium.

938
00:33:58,443 --> 00:34:01,310
- Next players, Soohorang Team. / - This is VR too?

939
00:34:01,310 --> 00:34:02,943
That's VR too.

940
00:34:02,943 --> 00:34:03,977
I thought you were going on a real one.

941
00:34:03,977 --> 00:34:05,543
It's all VR.

942
00:34:05,843 --> 00:34:07,443
I thought you were going for real.

943
00:34:07,443 --> 00:34:08,443
There are no handles.

944
00:34:08,443 --> 00:34:09,643
This can't be right.

945
00:34:10,510 --> 00:34:11,310
What's going on?

946
00:34:11,410 --> 00:34:12,577
What's going on?

947
00:34:12,577 --> 00:34:13,943
There are no handles.

948
00:34:13,943 --> 00:34:16,143
If you don't take this seriously, you could get sick.

949
00:34:16,143 --> 00:34:17,610
- That's right. / - You will.

950
00:34:20,143 --> 00:34:21,410
Drive, drive.

951
00:34:21,410 --> 00:34:22,277
I am.

952
00:34:25,243 --> 00:34:26,477
Left, left, left.

953
00:34:27,543 --> 00:34:30,377
(Hahahaha)

954
00:34:30,677 --> 00:34:31,943
This is amazing.

955
00:34:32,477 --> 00:34:35,277
- Seriously, people are genius. / - Anyone can do it.

956
00:34:35,277 --> 00:34:36,843
Even kids.

957
00:34:41,677 --> 00:34:43,310
This would be so scary in real life.

958
00:34:46,277 --> 00:34:51,777
(The cold wind of Pyeongchang at 150km per hour)

959
00:34:52,577 --> 00:34:55,543
(Pressure that exceeds gravity by several times)

960
00:34:57,210 --> 00:35:01,610
(They're overcoming the pressure)

961
00:35:01,610 --> 00:35:03,977
(With their frivolous behavior)

962
00:35:05,043 --> 00:35:06,577
(The race comes to an end)

963
00:35:06,577 --> 00:35:07,710
The thing is...

964
00:35:07,710 --> 00:35:09,043
That place isn't an amusement park.

965
00:35:09,043 --> 00:35:10,677
So when you take the helmet off,

966
00:35:10,677 --> 00:35:12,410
the attendant is like, "You can get off now."

967
00:35:12,410 --> 00:35:13,677
It feels so awkward.

968
00:35:15,243 --> 00:35:16,343
1 minute 12 seconds?

969
00:35:16,343 --> 00:35:17,110
Come out.

970
00:35:18,177 --> 00:35:21,077
If you lose to me in this, that's two losses.

971
00:35:21,077 --> 00:35:21,810
Be quiet.

972
00:35:22,577 --> 00:35:23,477
Thank you.

973
00:35:24,677 --> 00:35:27,977
This is the PyeongChang Olympic bobsleigh stadium.

974
00:35:27,977 --> 00:35:29,710
Next players...

975
00:35:31,277 --> 00:35:32,110
Why? Why? Why?

976
00:35:32,843 --> 00:35:33,843
We're heading out now.

977
00:35:33,843 --> 00:35:34,277
Why? Why? Why?

978
00:35:34,277 --> 00:35:35,343
What's going on?

979
00:35:37,210 --> 00:35:39,277
So the person in front has to drive well.

980
00:35:39,443 --> 00:35:40,143
(Hey)

981
00:35:42,077 --> 00:35:44,010
Seungkwan!

982
00:35:44,010 --> 00:35:45,910
Seungkwan!

983
00:35:46,777 --> 00:35:48,310
He's so eager.

984
00:35:48,310 --> 00:35:49,077
Because he wants to win.

985
00:35:50,710 --> 00:35:51,410
Be quiet.

986
00:35:52,177 --> 00:35:54,143
(He starts the game with a fighting spirit)

987
00:35:56,743 --> 00:35:58,277
Hey, hey, we're flying...

988
00:35:59,577 --> 00:36:00,710
We've flipped over.

989
00:36:00,710 --> 00:36:02,077
We've flipped over.

990
00:36:03,377 --> 00:36:04,877
You can flip over. You need to hold on.

991
00:36:05,310 --> 00:36:06,477
If you don't drive properly...

992
00:36:07,143 --> 00:36:08,143
This is what happens.

993
00:36:09,310 --> 00:36:10,843
That'd be so scary.

994
00:36:16,110 --> 00:36:18,343
You have no idea how pathetic I thought Mingyu was.

995
00:36:19,043 --> 00:36:21,343
I told him several times to be careful.

996
00:36:21,343 --> 00:36:24,310
- Seungkwan was really good. / - Yes.

997
00:36:24,310 --> 00:36:26,377
Geez.

998
00:36:26,377 --> 00:36:27,010
Eliminated.

999
00:36:27,810 --> 00:36:28,477
Fail.

1000
00:36:29,077 --> 00:36:30,910
You pulled too hard.

1001
00:36:30,910 --> 00:36:32,077
That's why it flipped.

1002
00:36:33,210 --> 00:36:35,043
Are you good at sports, Seungkwan?

1003
00:36:35,043 --> 00:36:35,977
Yes.

1004
00:36:35,977 --> 00:36:37,110
Really?

1005
00:36:37,110 --> 00:36:39,077
Basketball, volleyball, soccer, etc.

1006
00:36:39,077 --> 00:36:40,443
I'm good with ball games.

1007
00:36:41,443 --> 00:36:44,010
- You lost in the end. / - Please step forward.

1008
00:36:44,277 --> 00:36:46,910
- Are they all connected? / - Yes.

1009
00:36:47,343 --> 00:36:48,710
Do they even have an awards ceremony for you?

1010
00:36:48,710 --> 00:36:50,343
You can experience the medal ceremony.

1011
00:36:50,343 --> 00:36:52,077
- Really? / - They all have one.

1012
00:36:52,077 --> 00:36:53,177
That's so fun.

1013
00:36:53,177 --> 00:36:54,043
It's funny.

1014
00:36:54,043 --> 00:36:55,577
I need to try that with my friends.

1015
00:36:56,177 --> 00:36:57,477
You give each other medals?

1016
00:36:57,477 --> 00:36:58,643
You just need to have fun.

1017
00:36:58,643 --> 00:37:00,010
They have that.

1018
00:37:02,977 --> 00:37:04,710
(Who won the gold medal?)

1019
00:37:04,710 --> 00:37:06,777
That's so adorable.

1020
00:37:06,777 --> 00:37:07,410
Athletes cry, right?

1021
00:37:07,410 --> 00:37:09,077
It will be fun with friends.

1022
00:37:09,743 --> 00:37:11,877
- With friends. / - He won gold when he can't ride it.

1023
00:37:12,743 --> 00:37:15,043
When you do that, the employees stare at you.

1024
00:37:15,543 --> 00:37:17,110
Like this.

1025
00:37:17,110 --> 00:37:18,877
But you have to overcome the embarrassment.

1026
00:37:18,877 --> 00:37:20,543
You can see it on screen like that.

1027
00:37:20,543 --> 00:37:22,943
They even have a seat for the commentators.

1028
00:37:22,943 --> 00:37:24,443
This has been Seungkwan...

1029
00:37:24,443 --> 00:37:24,943
And Mingyu.

1030
00:37:24,943 --> 00:37:27,877
The PyeongChang ICT Center is very nice!

1031
00:37:29,077 --> 00:37:31,010
You enjoyed everything there.

1032
00:37:31,010 --> 00:37:31,710
Yes, that's right.

1033
00:37:31,710 --> 00:37:33,577
Everything is free if you go there right now.

1034
00:37:33,577 --> 00:37:34,843
- That's a really good opportunity. / - Yes.

1035
00:37:34,843 --> 00:37:36,877
It's going to be really popular from tomorrow.

1036
00:37:36,877 --> 00:37:38,843
It's time for us to be tired.

1037
00:37:38,843 --> 00:37:40,243
It's time for us to melt our bodies.

1038
00:37:40,243 --> 00:37:42,243
- Yes, it's time. / - Hot spring?

1039
00:37:42,243 --> 00:37:42,877
Not that extravagant.

1040
00:37:42,877 --> 00:37:44,177
We can't afford that.

1041
00:37:44,943 --> 00:37:46,010
Goodness.

1042
00:37:48,477 --> 00:37:49,977
Woljeongsa...

1043
00:37:50,977 --> 00:37:54,677
- It's one of the best views... / - Oh, a therapeutic walk.

1044
00:37:55,310 --> 00:37:57,410
And they have things that are preserved

1045
00:37:57,410 --> 00:37:58,077
for thousands of years.

1046
00:37:59,310 --> 00:38:00,477
Woljeongsa.

1047
00:38:00,477 --> 00:38:03,177
That Needle Fir Forest is really famous.

1048
00:38:03,177 --> 00:38:04,443
It's famous.

1049
00:38:04,443 --> 00:38:06,977
People come here even if they're not Buddhists.

1050
00:38:08,377 --> 00:38:09,977
This is where they filmed the "Guardian."

1051
00:38:09,977 --> 00:38:11,643
That's right.

1052
00:38:11,643 --> 00:38:13,077
Right from the entrance...

1053
00:38:13,077 --> 00:38:14,610
Main gate.

1054
00:38:14,810 --> 00:38:17,843
I feel so at peace.

1055
00:38:21,377 --> 00:38:22,377
This is really relaxing.

1056
00:38:23,410 --> 00:38:25,177
It's really relaxing when you see tall trees.

1057
00:38:26,177 --> 00:38:27,677
We're really taking a therapeutic walk.

1058
00:38:27,677 --> 00:38:28,643
A green shower.

1059
00:38:28,643 --> 00:38:30,743
This really is effective for your health.

1060
00:38:30,743 --> 00:38:33,810
I think how you feel is

1061
00:38:33,810 --> 00:38:35,410
important for health.

1062
00:38:35,410 --> 00:38:37,010
Seungkwan, this.

1063
00:38:37,010 --> 00:38:38,677
It's the trumpet from the drama.

1064
00:38:38,677 --> 00:38:39,377
Really?

1065
00:38:40,243 --> 00:38:40,710
(Source, CJ E&amp;M)

1066
00:38:40,710 --> 00:38:44,943
("Guardian" became a syndrome last year)

1067
00:38:46,677 --> 00:38:49,577
(The goblin bride came here to avoid a tragic destiny)

1068
00:38:55,210 --> 00:39:00,510
(They showed a picturesque view of Needle Fir Forest)

1069
00:39:00,510 --> 00:39:03,743
The Needle Fir Forest trail is one of the top three.

1070
00:39:03,743 --> 00:39:06,277
- Yes. / - It's so pretty there.

1071
00:39:06,677 --> 00:39:08,743
You have to take pictures like this.

1072
00:39:09,743 --> 00:39:11,377
Don't do it.

1073
00:39:12,410 --> 00:39:13,377
It suits him.

1074
00:39:13,377 --> 00:39:15,010
Rich.

1075
00:39:15,010 --> 00:39:17,043
I look rich.

1076
00:39:17,043 --> 00:39:18,910
- He looks really rich. / - Yes, I'm really rich.

1077
00:39:18,910 --> 00:39:21,143
I gained weight from eating a lot at that time.

1078
00:39:21,143 --> 00:39:23,643
With that fur coat...

1079
00:39:23,810 --> 00:39:26,143
(His emotions explode with the music)

1080
00:39:30,377 --> 00:39:32,377
We need music to get in the mood.

1081
00:39:35,343 --> 00:39:37,843
Look this way. Stop.

1082
00:39:38,843 --> 00:39:39,943
I think I can cry.

1083
00:39:39,943 --> 00:39:41,743
My eyes are stinging from not blinking.

1084
00:39:43,910 --> 00:39:50,377
- One drop. / - It's falling.

1085
00:39:52,043 --> 00:39:53,143
What an actor.

1086
00:39:53,143 --> 00:39:55,610
You cry if you keep your eyes open for 1 minute.

1087
00:39:56,977 --> 00:40:00,943
There's Woljeongsa but also teahouses

1088
00:40:00,943 --> 00:40:02,043
and bakeries.

1089
00:40:05,710 --> 00:40:08,377
- Let's calm our hearts. / - It's so nice here.

1090
00:40:08,810 --> 00:40:10,143
Hello.

1091
00:40:10,577 --> 00:40:11,710
Hello.

1092
00:40:12,810 --> 00:40:13,910
So nice here.

1093
00:40:13,910 --> 00:40:14,877
Where is this place?

1094
00:40:14,877 --> 00:40:16,443
I love the heater in the mountains.

1095
00:40:16,443 --> 00:40:19,577
It's a teahouse further in from Woljeongsa.

1096
00:40:19,577 --> 00:40:22,110
- Oh, a teahouse. / - It's right there.

1097
00:40:24,110 --> 00:40:26,677
(A warm cup of tea melts the frozen body)

1098
00:40:27,943 --> 00:40:29,010
It's so good.

1099
00:40:29,810 --> 00:40:33,310
First, we had buckwheat meal for $39.

1100
00:40:33,310 --> 00:40:35,610
- We also went trout fishing. / - Yes, trout fishing.

1101
00:40:35,610 --> 00:40:37,977
The entrance fee was $13 per person.

1102
00:40:37,977 --> 00:40:40,243
That's $26 and the fishing rods were $6.

1103
00:40:40,243 --> 00:40:42,910
We paid the Woljeongsa entrance fee and parking.

1104
00:40:42,910 --> 00:40:46,143
The tea cost $5 each, so that makes it...

1105
00:40:46,143 --> 00:40:47,177
$10.

1106
00:40:47,177 --> 00:40:49,410
- $4? / - We have $4 left.

1107
00:40:49,710 --> 00:40:51,577
(Self-praise)

1108
00:40:51,577 --> 00:40:54,143
- This was a neat trip. / - Yes, it was a neat trip.

1109
00:40:54,143 --> 00:40:56,843
This is our last location.

1110
00:40:57,943 --> 00:40:59,277
How does it feel?

1111
00:40:59,277 --> 00:41:01,443
I think it's really hard to do

1112
00:41:01,443 --> 00:41:04,477
everything that you want to do on a trip.

1113
00:41:04,477 --> 00:41:08,377
I never wanted to do

1114
00:41:08,377 --> 00:41:10,210
anything else than work.

1115
00:41:10,210 --> 00:41:11,710
Through traveling, I was able to try out other things.

1116
00:41:11,710 --> 00:41:13,843
- They looked the happiest then. / - Yes.

1117
00:41:14,643 --> 00:41:18,243
I realize why people go on trips.

1118
00:41:18,243 --> 00:41:21,477
We just came and had fun for a day.

1119
00:41:22,177 --> 00:41:22,543
That's good.

1120
00:41:22,543 --> 00:41:24,043
I think we gave them lots

1121
00:41:24,043 --> 00:41:26,610
of good tips.

1122
00:41:26,610 --> 00:41:27,943
Eat whatever you want to eat.

1123
00:41:27,943 --> 00:41:29,210
And when a friend is driving,

1124
00:41:29,210 --> 00:41:31,477
you shouldn't sleep.

1125
00:41:32,743 --> 00:41:35,210
That's a grudge.

1126
00:41:35,210 --> 00:41:37,577
- This has been... / - He slept so soundly.

1127
00:41:38,110 --> 00:41:40,543
(This was the BuGyu Trip)

1128
00:41:43,677 --> 00:41:46,443
That was a packed trip.

1129
00:41:46,443 --> 00:41:49,210
Mingyu and Seungkwan have...

1130
00:41:49,210 --> 00:41:51,077
- Good chemistry. / - Thank you.

1131
00:41:51,077 --> 00:41:54,343
- They're really close friends. / - We're really close.

1132
00:41:54,343 --> 00:41:56,943
Even if we fight, we don't hold grudges.

1133
00:41:56,943 --> 00:41:59,077
- We forget why we fight. / - Why do you fight?

1134
00:41:59,077 --> 00:42:01,310
"Seungkwan, you can't sleep during a shoot."

1135
00:42:01,310 --> 00:42:02,443
Saying stuff like that.

1136
00:42:02,443 --> 00:42:04,543
That was a problem though.

1137
00:42:06,010 --> 00:42:08,077
- I see. / - The VR experience center...

1138
00:42:08,077 --> 00:42:09,743
Was the most impressive for me.

1139
00:42:09,743 --> 00:42:11,810
Can you explain how fun it was because

1140
00:42:11,810 --> 00:42:13,477
it wasn't expressed properly through the screen.

1141
00:42:13,477 --> 00:42:15,910
We got to know how fun the winter games will be

1142
00:42:15,910 --> 00:42:17,843
after going there.

1143
00:42:17,843 --> 00:42:18,377
How important it is?

1144
00:42:18,377 --> 00:42:21,177
We also got to know how hard they were trying

1145
00:42:21,177 --> 00:42:22,477
to prepare for this event.

1146
00:42:22,477 --> 00:42:25,843
You can only go there during the Olympics, right?

1147
00:42:25,843 --> 00:42:27,043
That's right.

1148
00:42:27,043 --> 00:42:28,243
Let's see the final cost.

1149
00:42:28,243 --> 00:42:30,443
We had a quick look and it seemed

1150
00:42:30,443 --> 00:42:31,910
they spent their money well.

1151
00:42:31,910 --> 00:42:33,310
- How much was the final cost? / - What's the final cost?

1152
00:42:33,310 --> 00:42:36,310
The BuGyu day trip...

1153
00:42:36,310 --> 00:42:39,277
- Excluding transportation costs... / - Excluding that...

1154
00:42:39,277 --> 00:42:41,477
We spent $96.

1155
00:42:42,977 --> 00:42:45,510
- That's $48 per person. / - That's right.

1156
00:42:45,510 --> 00:42:47,977
Okay. Final words.

1157
00:42:47,977 --> 00:42:50,577
Where is the place for the Winter Olympics?

1158
00:42:50,577 --> 00:42:51,743
- Pyeongchang. / - That's right.

1159
00:42:51,743 --> 00:42:53,710
When do you think we will ever have

1160
00:42:53,710 --> 00:42:56,810
the chance to take a trip there?

1161
00:42:56,810 --> 00:43:01,477
It's not easy and it's an amazing fact that the

1162
00:43:01,477 --> 00:43:03,410
2018 PyeongChang Olympics is being held in Korea.

1163
00:43:03,410 --> 00:43:05,210
A winter trip to Pyeongchang...

1164
00:43:05,210 --> 00:43:09,443
If it's the BuGyu Trip, I don't want to miss it.

1165
00:43:10,877 --> 00:43:12,710
Very good.

1166
00:43:12,710 --> 00:43:13,743
Okay.

1167
00:43:13,743 --> 00:43:17,077
If you would like to take the BuGyu Trip

1168
00:43:17,077 --> 00:43:20,910
to Pyeongchang, please vote!

1169
00:43:23,243 --> 00:43:25,477
(What will the judges decide?)

1170
00:43:25,477 --> 00:43:26,943
You look a little nervous.

1171
00:43:26,943 --> 00:43:28,377
They did a lot of

1172
00:43:28,377 --> 00:43:30,643
physical activities like exercise.

1173
00:43:30,643 --> 00:43:31,710
They did fun games.

1174
00:43:31,710 --> 00:43:33,910
We didn't play any games.

1175
00:43:33,910 --> 00:43:36,177
We took our time and went on a trip to relax.

1176
00:43:36,177 --> 00:43:36,777
Like seniors?

1177
00:43:36,777 --> 00:43:39,210
Yes, we relaxed like a senior.

1178
00:43:39,210 --> 00:43:41,077
- You go on a trip to relax. / - Yes.

1179
00:43:41,077 --> 00:43:44,310
It felt so good to see the sea

1180
00:43:44,310 --> 00:43:45,477
even though it's the winter.

1181
00:43:45,477 --> 00:43:46,277
The winter sea is amazing.

1182
00:43:46,277 --> 00:43:50,243
- Fish tastes better when it's cold. / - It's good.

1183
00:43:50,243 --> 00:43:51,943
It's a nice place to go with your lover.

1184
00:43:51,943 --> 00:43:54,277
That's why they have the "Winter Sea" song.

1185
00:43:54,277 --> 00:43:55,077
It's the best.

1186
00:43:55,077 --> 00:43:56,543
- Let's go see your trip. / - Okay.

1187
00:43:56,543 --> 00:43:57,777
What's your team name?

1188
00:43:57,777 --> 00:44:00,743
- Our name... / - I'm really looking forward to it.

1189
00:44:00,743 --> 00:44:02,177
Show us the composure of seniors.

1190
00:44:02,177 --> 00:44:04,410
You can't talk about Gangneung without ongsimi.

1191
00:44:04,410 --> 00:44:05,477
Let's wait and see.

1192
00:44:05,477 --> 00:44:07,310
So we're, Namsimi...

1193
00:44:07,310 --> 00:44:10,110
And Jongsimi's Gangneung Tour.

1194
00:44:10,110 --> 00:44:12,343
Let's go see it.

1195
00:44:17,310 --> 00:44:19,710
(The original perfect dance group, INFINITE)

1196
00:44:21,243 --> 00:44:23,577
(It's already been 9 years since they debuted)

1197
00:44:24,477 --> 00:44:25,843
Hello.

1198
00:44:26,410 --> 00:44:27,743
Do you have a traveling style?

1199
00:44:27,743 --> 00:44:29,877
Seongjong likes to go to a lot of places.

1200
00:44:29,877 --> 00:44:32,110
I like to walk and take pictures.

1201
00:44:32,110 --> 00:44:32,877
He likes to rest.

1202
00:44:32,877 --> 00:44:33,877
Yes, I like to rest.

1203
00:44:33,877 --> 00:44:35,443
There's a place that has good bulgogi.

1204
00:44:35,443 --> 00:44:36,777
I like things like that.

1205
00:44:36,777 --> 00:44:39,710
Have you ever gone on trips together

1206
00:44:39,710 --> 00:44:40,377
apart from work?

1207
00:44:40,377 --> 00:44:42,443
- Not with him. / - We haven't.

1208
00:44:42,443 --> 00:44:45,010
I need to clean up after him if I go on a trip with him.

1209
00:44:45,010 --> 00:44:46,677
- I need to... / - It's a bother.

1210
00:44:46,677 --> 00:44:48,077
I need to take care of him.

1211
00:44:48,077 --> 00:44:51,877
The theme is domestic winter trip.

1212
00:44:51,877 --> 00:44:53,543
- Winter trip? / - To Gangwon-do.

1213
00:44:53,543 --> 00:44:54,743
Gangwon-do is nice.

1214
00:44:54,743 --> 00:44:56,643
The budget is $100 for 2 people.

1215
00:44:56,643 --> 00:44:58,777
I think we can spend $100 by eating Korean beef.

1216
00:44:58,777 --> 00:45:00,143
We'll have to save money.

1217
00:45:00,143 --> 00:45:01,410
Should we eat at cart bars?

1218
00:45:02,677 --> 00:45:05,310
- Is this your first time planning a trip? / - Yes.

1219
00:45:05,310 --> 00:45:07,177
It's my first time with him.

1220
00:45:07,177 --> 00:45:09,010
We've never been on a trip together.

1221
00:45:09,010 --> 00:45:10,277
Let's see the map first.

1222
00:45:10,277 --> 00:45:12,543
This is Jumunjin, where they shot the "Guardian."

1223
00:45:12,543 --> 00:45:14,377
This is Ojukheon.

1224
00:45:14,377 --> 00:45:16,043
There are a lot of places here.

1225
00:45:16,043 --> 00:45:17,877
We can go here. We can ride rail bikes here.

1226
00:45:17,877 --> 00:45:19,477
We avoided popular places

1227
00:45:19,477 --> 00:45:21,610
that come up on searches.

1228
00:45:21,843 --> 00:45:23,110
That's a good idea.

1229
00:45:23,110 --> 00:45:24,577
Was it because of the cold wave?

1230
00:45:24,577 --> 00:45:26,777
- What? / - It wasn't because it was cold.

1231
00:45:26,777 --> 00:45:28,477
We wanted to relax.

1232
00:45:28,710 --> 00:45:32,310
There's a place where I wanted to go in Gangneung.

1233
00:45:32,310 --> 00:45:33,777
That's nice. It's cheap.

1234
00:45:33,777 --> 00:45:35,543
I screen captured this.

1235
00:45:35,543 --> 00:45:38,477
These are restaurants.

1236
00:45:39,077 --> 00:45:42,210
I searched restaurants that people didn't know about.

1237
00:45:42,210 --> 00:45:43,843
Are we going to take the KTX?

1238
00:45:43,843 --> 00:45:46,210
I'll check the application.

1239
00:45:46,210 --> 00:45:47,877
- I'm good at searching these. / - You have the app?

1240
00:45:47,877 --> 00:45:49,810
- It's really fast... / - I use it to travel sometimes.

1241
00:45:49,810 --> 00:45:51,777
Wait a minute. We leave from Seoul.

1242
00:45:51,777 --> 00:45:55,643
- Let's leave early. / - Okay, how about 6 or 7?

1243
00:45:56,210 --> 00:45:57,410
- In the morning? / - Yes.

1244
00:45:57,810 --> 00:45:59,877
We won't be able to do anything otherwise.

1245
00:45:59,877 --> 00:46:02,077
The sun goes down at 5 p.m.

1246
00:46:02,077 --> 00:46:03,710
But that's too early.

1247
00:46:03,710 --> 00:46:05,343
- We have to leave then. / - Let's leave at 8 a.m.

1248
00:46:05,343 --> 00:46:07,277
There's a train at 8:01 a.m.

1249
00:46:07,277 --> 00:46:09,043
Then we'll arrive at 10 a.m.

1250
00:46:09,043 --> 00:46:10,810
Let's take a taxi at Gangneung.

1251
00:46:10,810 --> 00:46:13,077
- We can rent a car at the station. / - How detailed.

1252
00:46:13,077 --> 00:46:15,443
- We'll eat. / - They laid out a full plan.

1253
00:46:15,443 --> 00:46:16,443
It was our first time going there.

1254
00:46:16,443 --> 00:46:18,110
Seongjong doesn't usually study

1255
00:46:18,110 --> 00:46:19,877
but he studied hard then.

1256
00:46:20,443 --> 00:46:22,543
It's really nice to go on trips with people like Seongjong.

1257
00:46:22,543 --> 00:46:24,977
- I plan before going on a trip. / - Since you plan.

1258
00:46:24,977 --> 00:46:26,543
It's going to be hard.

1259
00:46:27,643 --> 00:46:28,910
It's going to be a hard trip.

1260
00:46:28,910 --> 00:46:30,910
- Our team name is... / - Our team name is...

1261
00:46:30,910 --> 00:46:33,643
Wait a minute, I have that famous scene.

1262
00:46:33,643 --> 00:46:34,777
The lemon candy.

1263
00:46:34,777 --> 00:46:39,410
Don't show this!

1264
00:46:39,810 --> 00:46:41,010
They're going to show it?

1265
00:46:43,243 --> 00:46:44,543
Hello, little lady.

1266
00:46:44,543 --> 00:46:46,410
We meet again.

1267
00:46:46,410 --> 00:46:48,543
If you have a lot on your mind, eat lemon candy.

He was voted the worst idol actor.

1269
00:46:51,877 --> 00:46:53,243
Lemon candy.

1270
00:46:53,243 --> 00:46:56,277
What's your famous scene?

1271
00:46:57,577 --> 00:47:00,077
I'll think about it. We have some time.

1272
00:47:00,210 --> 00:47:01,210
(Seoul Station, January 23rd)

1273
00:47:01,210 --> 00:47:02,577
Hello.

1274
00:47:02,577 --> 00:47:05,243
There's a cold wave today.

1275
00:47:05,243 --> 00:47:07,243

- They're reporting the cold wave. / - But it was fun.

1279
00:47:15,177 --> 00:47:18,310
We even received a warning text message.

1280
00:47:18,310 --> 00:47:20,177
It's the coldest day to date.

1281
00:47:20,843 --> 00:47:21,743
So cold.

1282
00:47:21,743 --> 00:47:22,610
Let's go back in.

1283
00:47:23,677 --> 00:47:25,377
(The waves are getting stronger)

1284
00:47:25,377 --> 00:47:26,643
The waves were unbelievable.

1285
00:47:26,643 --> 00:47:27,977
It freezes,

1286
00:47:27,977 --> 00:47:29,610
even if it's salt water.

1287
00:47:29,610 --> 00:47:30,877
My goodness.

1288
00:47:31,277 --> 00:47:32,310
- We can't go in. / - Why?

1289
00:47:32,310 --> 00:47:35,110
Because the beach was flooded.

1290
00:47:35,110 --> 00:47:36,777
Let's go.

1291
00:47:37,777 --> 00:47:40,443
Wow!

1292
00:47:40,443 --> 00:47:42,643
What a pity.

1293
00:47:42,643 --> 00:47:44,610
What a pity.

1294
00:47:45,110 --> 00:47:46,677
(Will they overcome their sad legend?)

1295
00:47:48,077 --> 00:47:50,577
- It takes 2 hours, let's go. / - Yes, it takes 2 hours.

1296
00:47:50,577 --> 00:47:53,110

00:47:53,110 --> 00:47:54,643
Let's go.

1298
00:47:56,243 --> 00:47:57,610
It's so cold.

1299
00:47:59,810 --> 00:48:01,310
No. 14...

1300
00:48:01,310 --> 00:48:03,677
We need to take the sixth car.

1301
00:48:05,510 --> 00:48:06,643
Right now...

1302
00:48:07,510 --> 00:48:08,677
The number of people...

1303
00:48:08,677 --> 00:48:10,577
No. 14. Isn't this our train?

1304
00:48:10,577 --> 00:48:12,643
- That one down there? / - Yes, it's here.

1305
00:48:12,943 --> 00:48:16,010
It's my first time traveling this early in the morning.

1306
00:48:16,010 --> 00:48:17,143
Really?

1307
00:48:19,877 --> 00:48:22,043
We need to set this up like this.

1308
00:48:22,443 --> 00:48:24,177
That's a good idea.

1309
00:48:24,177 --> 00:48:25,943
Seniors set them up.

1310
00:48:25,943 --> 00:48:28,977

1311
00:48:28,977 --> 00:48:31,510

00:48:31,510 --> 00:48:34,377
- Our tour name... / - How about potatoes?

1313
00:48:34,377 --> 00:48:36,110
Potatoes are good for you.

1314
00:48:37,210 --> 00:48:39,077
- I feel like ongsimi. / - Ongsimi?

1315
00:48:39,077 --> 00:48:40,377

00:48:49,543 --> 00:48:52,277
- Just one hand. / - No, I'm greedy so two.

1321
00:48:55,110 --> 00:48:57,810
(Temporary train runs from the airport during Olympics)

1322
00:48:59,543 --> 00:49:01,243
We're here for our rental car.

1323
00:49:01,243 --> 00:49:03,043

1324
00:49:03,043 --> 00:49:04,710

It's Nam Woohyun.

1326
00:49:07,343 --> 00:49:08,877
(Rent car, $6 per day, depending on insurance)

1327
00:49:10,110 --> 00:49:12,077

So cold.

00:49:25,943 --> 00:49:28,277
It's been a while since I've been in a car that you drive.

1334
00:49:28,277 --> 00:49:30,077
It seems cold but the weather seems nice and clear.

1335
00:49:30,077 --> 00:49:31,777
Fortunately it looked that way on screen.

1336
00:49:31,777 --> 00:49:35,243
- By what time? / - We will go to three places.

1337
00:49:35,243 --> 00:49:37,010
And we'll have two meals.

We will take the train at 8 p.m.

1339
00:49:39,510 --> 00:49:42,243
The important thing is that this plan...

1340
00:49:42,243 --> 00:49:44,543
- Excludes transportation. / - Excluding that...

1341
00:49:44,543 --> 00:49:48,510

00:49:48,510 --> 00:49:49,843
- That's right. / - $100.

1343
00:49:50,143 --> 00:49:51,543
Where are we going for a drive?

1344
00:49:51,543 --> 00:49:53,643
Heonhwa Road.

1345
00:49:53,643 --> 00:49:55,943
The course that's closest to the sea in Gangneung.

1346
00:49:55,943 --> 00:49:59,043

to visit there.

1356
00:50:21,943 --> 00:50:23,910
You don't have to speed there.

1357
00:50:23,910 --> 00:50:25,777
- You can drive slowly. / - Yes, you can drive slowly.

1358
00:50:25,777 --> 00:50:28,277
This is the true ocean.

1359
00:50:28,277 --> 00:50:29,743
The winter sea is so nice.

1360
00:50:30,443 --> 00:50:31,877
The winter sea feels nice.

1361
00:50:31,877 --> 00:50:34,043
It makes you relax.

1362
00:50:34,043 --> 00:50:36,877
It's nice just by looking at it.

1363
00:50:36,877 --> 00:50:37,877
It's pretty.

1364
00:50:37,877 --> 00:50:40,810
It's a great road for driving.

1365
00:50:41,343 --> 00:50:42,577
This is amazing.

1366
00:50:43,477 --> 00:50:44,543
Goodness, it's so pretty.

1367
00:50:44,543 --> 00:50:45,810
I can't believe I'm here with you.

1368
00:50:45,810 --> 00:50:47,943
You should be honored.

1369
00:50:48,243 --> 00:50:50,610
- Wow. / - This is the winter sea.

1370
00:50:50,610 --> 00:50:52,477

Just driving there felt so good.

There's a tent bar there.

1375

Those places have great food.

1376
00:51:01,277 --> 00:51:04,510
Those places have the best raw fish.

1377
00:51:05,477 --> 00:51:05,810

1381

This is the place.

1382
00:51:17,510 --> 00:51:19,110
Rice topped with raw fish looks good.

1383
00:51:19,110 --> 00:51:21,143
Not many people know about this place.

1384
00:51:21,677 --> 00:51:23,677

00:51:37,477 --> 00:51:39,110
As you see, the people sitting there are

1389
00:51:39,110 --> 00:51:40,877
all local people.

1390
00:51:40,877 --> 00:51:42,477
It's a hidden gem.

1391

It feels special to eat in a tent bar like this.

1398
00:51:59,110 --> 00:52:01,743
If you come here at night...

1399
00:52:02,543 --> 00:52:06,210
This view right here...

1400
00:52:06,610 --> 00:52:08,277
Imagine having a glass of soju here.

1401
00:52:08,277 --> 00:52:09,543
I know what you mean.

1402
00:52:09,543 --> 00:52:11,877
I'm sure I can finish all the alcohol they have here.

(It's delicious)

1423
00:52:59,643 --> 00:53:00,710
It's good.

1424
00:53:00,710 --> 00:53:02,277
If you like spicy food like me,

1425
00:53:02,277 --> 00:53:04,543
it'd be better if you dip it.

1426
00:53:04,677 --> 00:53:07,310
I took a bite of the food and then looked at the sea.

1427
00:53:07,310 --> 00:53:10,443
- Seriously... / - It makes you say wow.

1428
00:53:12,010 --> 00:53:15,743
(Woohyun focuses on the food)

1429
00:53:20,943 --> 00:53:22,910
I can't help smiling.

1430
00:53:22,910 --> 00:53:24,177
Ma'am, the food is delicious.

1431
00:53:24,177 --> 00:53:28,510
If you mix rice with it, it tastes good too.

1432
00:53:28,510 --> 00:53:30,410
Really? If we mix rice into this?

1433
00:53:32,010 --> 00:53:34,143
That with some sesame oil would be great.

1434
00:53:34,143 --> 00:53:35,343

1436
00:53:37,410 --> 00:53:39,977
- With the sesame oil. / - You've been won over.

1437
00:53:39,977 --> 00:53:41,843
- Buckwheat. / - Come to your senses.

1438
00:53:41,843 --> 00:53:43,510
This is nice.

1439
00:53:47,243 --> 00:53:51,110
- It's game over. / - What's that steam? Is it CG?

1440
00:53:51,477 --> 00:53:53,610
No. It's all real.

1441
00:53:53,610 --> 00:53:55,477
It smells incredibly savory.

1442
00:53:55,477 --> 00:53:56,610
Okay, okay.

1443
00:53:58,677 --> 00:53:59,810
Let me try.

1444
00:54:01,710 --> 00:54:03,010
It's delicious.

1445
00:54:03,010 --> 00:54:04,843
It's very savory.

1446
00:54:06,743 --> 00:54:09,910
After eating two spoons of it, I almost called the police.

1447
00:54:09,910 --> 00:54:12,143
- Why? / - It stole all my rice.

1448
00:54:13,943 --> 00:54:18,010
You have to mix with rice if you order this dish.

1449
00:54:20,043 --> 00:54:21,777
- It's delicious. / - Right?

1450
00:54:22,810 --> 00:54:24,777
- It's here. / - It's here.

1451
00:54:24,777 --> 00:54:27,143
I'm so curious about this dish.

1452
00:54:29,243 --> 00:54:31,177
- It smells amazing. Goodness. / - Thank you.

1453
00:54:32,110 --> 00:54:34,910
(It's full of fresh snow crabs and shepherd's purse)

1454
00:54:37,077 --> 00:54:38,677
(He can't wait to taste the broth)

1455
00:54:38,677 --> 00:54:40,710
It's spicy and refreshing.

1456
00:54:41,543 --> 00:54:43,643
It warms my stomach.

1457
00:54:43,643 --> 00:54:44,810
This is a perfect dish for winter.

1458
00:54:47,110 --> 00:54:48,910
(Chewy)

1459
00:54:49,777 --> 00:54:53,310
By the way, this is $6.

1460
00:54:53,310 --> 00:54:55,877
In Seoul, you can't find a snow crab dish

1461
00:54:55,877 --> 00:54:57,310
that is $6.

1462
00:54:57,310 --> 00:54:58,677
This has so much snow crab in it.

1463
00:54:58,677 --> 00:55:00,677
Exactly. How can this be only $6?

1464
00:55:00,677 --> 00:55:02,110
It'd be over $10.

1465
00:55:02,110 --> 00:55:04,510
This is why we should travel to Gangneung.

1466
00:55:12,143 --> 00:55:17,310
I bet Sikyung would love this.

1467
00:55:17,310 --> 00:55:19,910
- Sikyung? / - He'd drink 20 bottles of soju.

1468
00:55:22,510 --> 00:55:26,110
Driving here in this kind of weather.

1469
00:55:26,610 --> 00:55:28,677
- Come here, have some noodles. / - I want some.

1470
00:55:28,677 --> 00:55:32,510
- If you come with a lover, it'd be amazing. / - Yeah.

1471
00:55:32,510 --> 00:55:35,643
Hashtag, romance tent bar. Hashtag, love station.

1472
00:55:35,643 --> 00:55:38,177
- Okay, station. / - Love station.

1473
00:55:38,177 --> 00:55:39,277
Here we go.

1474
00:55:39,277 --> 00:55:41,277
- That was good. / - It was.

1475
00:55:41,277 --> 00:55:42,843
It was really good, right?

1476
00:55:42,843 --> 00:55:46,577
(Driving on Heonhwa Road)

1477
00:55:46,577 --> 00:55:48,810
- It's only 2km from here. / - It's really close.

1478
00:55:48,810 --> 00:55:50,410
We'll get there soon.

1479
00:55:50,410 --> 00:55:53,677
Now that we had food, we headed to

1480
00:55:53,677 --> 00:55:55,643
Badabuchae-gil to digest.

1481
00:55:55,643 --> 00:55:57,377
The scenery is amazing.

1482
00:55:57,377 --> 00:55:59,710
The waves even hit the road.

1483
00:56:01,943 --> 00:56:02,877
- It's thrilling. / - Look how wet the road is.

1484
00:56:02,877 --> 00:56:05,377
The water is so clean.

1485
00:56:06,910 --> 00:56:08,577
(Badabuchae-gil is on Heonhwa Road)

1486
00:56:09,143 --> 00:56:10,843
We can go in there.

1487
00:56:10,977 --> 00:56:14,243
It's a hiking trail.

1488
00:56:14,243 --> 00:56:15,743
A really nice one.

1489
00:56:15,743 --> 00:56:17,143
We can walk there.

1490
00:56:17,143 --> 00:56:20,277
Walking will help us digest the food we ate.

1491
00:56:20,277 --> 00:56:22,310
I heard not many people know about this place.

1492
00:56:22,310 --> 00:56:23,343
No, not many know.

1493
00:56:23,343 --> 00:56:25,010
It hasn't even been open for a year.

1494
00:56:25,010 --> 00:56:26,777
There's a walking course there.

1495
00:56:26,777 --> 00:56:27,843
If you pay the entrance fee...

1496
00:56:27,843 --> 00:56:31,210
- You can walk there for about an hour. / - Walking?

1497
00:56:31,210 --> 00:56:33,810
The waves came up all the way here.

1498
00:56:33,843 --> 00:56:34,810
Look at that.

1499
00:56:34,810 --> 00:56:37,143
Gosh, we need to take pictures of this.

1500
00:56:37,277 --> 00:56:39,577
- Everyone... / - They're walking on the side.

1501
00:56:39,577 --> 00:56:41,910
People can walk on the road too?

1502
00:56:41,943 --> 00:56:43,277
Some people stop their cars and walk.

1503
00:56:43,277 --> 00:56:45,643
- It looks cool. / - The sea is really rough.

1504
00:56:46,177 --> 00:56:47,977
Here we are. Let's go.

1505
00:56:47,977 --> 00:56:49,477
We're here.

1506
00:56:53,443 --> 00:56:55,210
We're finally here.

1507
00:56:55,210 --> 00:56:58,443
This is the place I found.

1508
00:56:58,443 --> 00:57:00,443
Jongsimi and Namsimi's...

1509
00:57:00,443 --> 00:57:03,677
- Ocean road. / - It's been open less than a year.

1510
00:57:04,010 --> 00:57:06,977
- But it's so empty here. / - You're right.

1511
00:57:07,877 --> 00:57:09,043
Excuse me. What's going on?

1512
00:57:09,510 --> 00:57:10,943
- Closed? / - Closed?

1513
00:57:12,643 --> 00:57:15,043
Due to the weather conditions...

1514
00:57:15,043 --> 00:57:16,610
- We couldn't enter. / - Because of the cold?

1515
00:57:16,610 --> 00:57:18,710
I thought the waves were strong.

1516
00:57:18,710 --> 00:57:20,243
- This was totally unexpected / - It was.

1517
00:57:20,243 --> 00:57:22,310
- What a shock. / - It's all real.

1518
00:57:23,110 --> 00:57:24,543
It's been closed.

1519
00:57:24,543 --> 00:57:28,110
It doesn't make sense. Is the weather bad today?

1520
00:57:28,110 --> 00:57:30,510
It's just a little windy, isn't it?

1521
00:57:31,343 --> 00:57:34,277
It's quite windy and cold but...

1522
00:57:34,477 --> 00:57:36,510
It's quite cold but...

1523
00:57:37,010 --> 00:57:39,377
Is it so bad that we can't go in?

1524
00:57:39,377 --> 00:57:41,543
No way. We came for this.

1525
00:57:41,543 --> 00:57:43,743
We came so far.

1526
00:57:43,743 --> 00:57:44,510
There's no one there.

1527
00:57:44,510 --> 00:57:47,610
It's been closed due to weather.

1528
00:57:48,277 --> 00:57:50,010
Hello?

1529
00:57:50,010 --> 00:57:54,177
We're closed today because the waves are too high.

1530
00:57:54,310 --> 00:57:56,277
You can just check out the observatory.

1531
00:57:56,277 --> 00:57:57,943
- Up to there? / - Up to there?

1532
00:57:57,943 --> 00:57:59,710

1533
00:57:59,710 --> 00:58:01,310
- Free, free. / - Free.

1534
00:58:01,310 --> 00:58:02,377
It's for free

1535
00:58:03,377 --> 00:58:05,477
Free entrance to the observatory.

1536
00:58:05,477 --> 00:58:07,277
- For free? / - Yes.

1537
00:58:07,277 --> 00:58:10,077
- It's good that we don't have to spend money... / - Yes.

1538
00:58:10,077 --> 00:58:13,210
It's not like we planned it, right?

1539
00:58:13,210 --> 00:58:14,377
Right.

1540
00:58:15,110 --> 00:58:18,910
This place is nice.

1541
00:58:19,977 --> 00:58:21,810
Goodness, Woohyun. Look at the waves.

1542
00:58:21,810 --> 00:58:23,177
Amazing.

1543
00:58:24,943 --> 00:58:26,643
(What are they amazed at?)

1544
00:58:31,210 --> 00:58:32,843
It was really nice there.

1545
00:58:32,843 --> 00:58:34,643
You can take lifetime photos there.

1546
00:58:34,643 --> 00:58:37,243
It's like a scene from a movie.

1547
00:58:37,243 --> 00:58:38,743
(It has to be windy to see such powerful waves)

1548
00:58:39,343 --> 00:58:41,443
What a big wave.

1549
00:58:42,443 --> 00:58:43,543
Wow.

1550
00:58:43,543 --> 00:58:45,610
It's been a while since I've seen the winter sea.

1551
00:58:45,610 --> 00:58:47,110
I know. It's so cool.

1552
00:58:47,110 --> 00:58:50,843
- The waves make a rainbow. / - It looks awesome.

1553
00:58:51,810 --> 00:58:54,077
(The waves make a fantastic rainbow)

1554
00:58:54,077 --> 00:58:56,343
- It made me feel refreshed. / - It did.

1555
00:58:56,343 --> 00:58:58,610
- It's really nice here. / - It is.

1556
00:58:58,610 --> 00:58:59,877
That's the road we were driving on.

1557
00:58:59,877 --> 00:59:02,277
That's where we came from.

1558
00:59:02,277 --> 00:59:04,877
- We drove on that road and... / - And got here.

1559
00:59:04,877 --> 00:59:08,143
It would have been nice if we could take a walk

1560
00:59:08,143 --> 00:59:10,243
around there and take pictures.

1561
00:59:10,243 --> 00:59:12,310
It would have been nice if we could enter.

1562
00:59:12,643 --> 00:59:15,077
Many people prefer visiting the sea in summer.

1563
00:59:15,077 --> 00:59:18,143
- But the winter sea is charming too. / - It's charming.

1564
00:59:18,143 --> 00:59:20,277
(If weather allows, you should enjoy the closer view)

1565
00:59:20,777 --> 00:59:22,477
Photo, photo.

1566
00:59:22,877 --> 00:59:24,943
I'd better take a good photo.

1567
00:59:25,577 --> 00:59:27,410
I can't open my eyes.

1568
00:59:28,943 --> 00:59:30,743
- So nice, right? / - Wow.

1569
00:59:30,743 --> 00:59:32,077
The photo looks amazing.

1570
00:59:32,077 --> 00:59:33,610
It came out well.

1571
00:59:34,277 --> 00:59:36,143
- That's how you should take it. / - That red lighthouse.

1572
00:59:36,143 --> 00:59:37,543
- You get great photos. / - It's the highlight.

1573
00:59:37,543 --> 00:59:39,810
- That photo was a bit disappointing. / - Slightly.

1574
00:59:39,810 --> 00:59:41,877
They're idols.

1575
00:59:41,877 --> 00:59:43,043
(How to enjoy the sea in winter)

1576
00:59:44,610 --> 00:59:46,810
These days, people close their eyes in photos.

1577
00:59:46,810 --> 00:59:49,143
- We had to retake them in the old days. / - Like this?

1578
00:59:49,677 --> 00:59:52,210
We didn't get to go in all the way.

1579
00:59:52,210 --> 00:59:54,843
But maybe next time when the viewers come...

1580
00:59:54,843 --> 00:59:57,577
- The weather will be warmer. / - That's right.

1581
00:59:57,577 --> 00:59:59,843
- The perfect weather. / - Perfect weather.

1582
00:59:59,843 --> 01:00:03,443

- You must come here. / - It's so good here.

1584
01:00:07,577 --> 01:00:11,043
Let's head to the next location.

1585
01:00:12,110 --> 01:00:14,843
- Nice, we saved $1.50. / - Did you miss your members?

1586
01:00:14,843 --> 01:00:16,977
- Yes, I wanted to be there with them. / - Right?

1588
01:00:22,910 --> 01:00:24,377
Because the weather was nice.

Don't watch.

1590
01:00:25,810 --> 01:00:27,377
Here we go.

1591
01:00:27,377 --> 01:00:29,310
Here's another embarrassing moment.

1592

Seongjong read a book there.

1593
01:00:34,143 --> 01:00:35,243

Look at him with that red scarf.

1596
01:00:38,177 --> 01:00:40,377
It's so real.

- Arrived. / - Arrived.

1603

Look at the big waves.

1604
01:00:57,977 --> 01:00:59,977
There are many people here.

1605
01:01:00,377 --> 01:01:03,010
There are two spots. Which one is the real one?

1606

There are two spots. Which one is the real one?

1607

Oh, my goodness.

1608
01:01:09,610 --> 01:01:10,843
Oh, my goodness.

1609
01:01:10,843 --> 01:01:13,843
- You won't be able to shoot. / - It's too strong.

1610
01:01:14,310 --> 01:01:16,177
What a pity.

1611
01:01:16,743 --> 01:01:18,677
They must be all wet.

1612
01:01:18,877 --> 01:01:19,977
Oh, my God.

1613
01:01:19,977 --> 01:01:23,410
The shoot location is over there.

1614
01:01:23,410 --> 01:01:26,977
But it's shaded so we're going to the next one.

1615
01:01:26,977 --> 01:01:30,410
If you visit this place, go to the second site.

1616
01:01:30,410 --> 01:01:32,210
If it's the same, you can go there.

1617
01:01:32,210 --> 01:01:34,077
I prepared something.

1618
01:01:35,943 --> 01:01:37,277
Who are you going to play?

1619
01:01:37,277 --> 01:01:38,443
You can choose.

1620
01:01:38,443 --> 01:01:40,043
Okay, I choose Euntak.

1621
01:01:40,043 --> 01:01:42,043
- Will you be okay? / - Yeah.

1622
01:01:42,143 --> 01:01:44,510
- Okay. / - You appear when I blow.

1623
01:01:44,510 --> 01:01:46,110
Okay. Wait.

1624
01:01:46,110 --> 01:01:47,643
I'll give you a candle.

1625
01:01:48,543 --> 01:01:49,577
Here you go.

1626
01:01:49,777 --> 01:01:51,243
(Nam Wootak and Jong Guardian, take 1)

1627
01:01:52,910 --> 01:01:54,610
That looks cool.

1628
01:01:56,177 --> 01:01:58,077
Oh, dear.

1629
01:01:59,177 --> 01:02:01,310
(Why are you appearing from there?)

1630
01:02:01,677 --> 01:02:02,210
Retake, retake.

1631
01:02:02,210 --> 01:02:04,077
- Blooper. / - This is so cringing.

1632
01:02:04,310 --> 01:02:05,710
(Time for Seongjong's line)

1633
01:02:06,077 --> 01:02:07,710
Because the weather was nice.

1634
01:02:07,910 --> 01:02:09,543
Because the weather was nice.

1635
01:02:10,410 --> 01:02:14,343
- I'm cringing. / - You have to keep going.

1636
01:02:14,743 --> 01:02:16,577
Seongjong likes to read.

1637
01:02:16,577 --> 01:02:17,877
He reads it like a book.

1638
01:02:17,877 --> 01:02:19,543
- Look at that. / - The weather was nice...

1639
01:02:20,443 --> 01:02:21,743
- "Jong Guardian." / - "Jong Guardian."

1640
01:02:21,743 --> 01:02:24,010
That's such high quality.

1641
01:02:26,510 --> 01:02:28,710
(Cringing from the start)

1642
01:02:29,343 --> 01:02:30,910
What is this?

1643
01:02:31,610 --> 01:02:33,577
I prepared it for you.

1644
01:02:34,377 --> 01:02:35,343
(A flower from a guy, sigh)

1645
01:02:35,977 --> 01:02:37,777
Because the weather was nice.

1646
01:02:37,977 --> 01:02:39,343
The waves!

1647
01:02:39,343 --> 01:02:41,510
There are cold waves...

1648
01:02:41,510 --> 01:02:44,510
- The wind chill outside is -20℃. / - This is funny.

1649
01:02:44,510 --> 01:02:46,710
- It'll be the coldest day on record. / - The coldest.

1650
01:02:47,510 --> 01:02:48,943
Because the weather was nice.

1651
01:02:48,943 --> 01:02:51,043
Because the weather wasn't nice.

1652
01:02:51,043 --> 01:02:53,877
Because the weather was nice enough.

1653
01:02:53,877 --> 01:02:55,943
I loved every moment of it.

1654
01:02:57,077 --> 01:02:58,710
Go, go!

1655
01:02:59,810 --> 01:03:01,610
What was that?

1656
01:03:01,610 --> 01:03:02,210
Let's head to a cafe.

1657
01:03:02,210 --> 01:03:04,943
That's another embarrassing moment.

1658
01:03:05,410 --> 01:03:06,610
Hashtag, such bad acting.

1659
01:03:06,610 --> 01:03:09,077
Hashtag, is this the second lemon candy scene?

1660
01:03:09,077 --> 01:03:12,177
If you have too much on your mind, eat lemon candy.

1661
01:03:12,710 --> 01:03:14,143
Go where?

1662
01:03:14,143 --> 01:03:16,543
This area is not far from the filming site of "Guardian."

1663
01:03:16,543 --> 01:03:17,910
This is a cafe in Jumunjin.

1664
01:03:17,910 --> 01:03:19,743
I heard this street is the original cafe street.

1665
01:03:19,743 --> 01:03:20,443
Oh, really?

1666
01:03:20,443 --> 01:03:23,877
After this street got famous, other cafe streets came up.

1667
01:03:23,877 --> 01:03:25,177
Jumunjin is known for good coffee.

1668
01:03:25,177 --> 01:03:28,210
We need to heat up our bodies.

1669
01:03:28,210 --> 01:03:30,977
Let's have some warm coffee.

1670
01:03:31,877 --> 01:03:34,377
(They sat next to the window with an ocean view)

1671
01:03:35,310 --> 01:03:37,543
(How about a sip of coffee while watching the sea?)

1672
01:03:37,543 --> 01:03:39,843
So Seongjong planned everything?

1673
01:03:39,843 --> 01:03:41,310
Yes, I did most of the planning.

1674
01:03:41,310 --> 01:03:43,710
And Woohyun found the restaurants.

1675
01:03:43,710 --> 01:03:46,977
I'd like to order fresh lemonade...

1676
01:03:46,977 --> 01:03:48,710
And a cup of hot Americano please.

1677
01:03:48,710 --> 01:03:49,843
Also...

1678
01:03:50,643 --> 01:03:52,810
Homemade chocolate coffee bean bread.

1679
01:03:52,810 --> 01:03:54,077
One bread.

1680
01:03:54,077 --> 01:03:55,110
One cookie.

1681
01:03:56,243 --> 01:03:59,243
- This place is nice. / - I know.

1682
01:03:59,877 --> 01:04:03,010
- People would love to visit a cafe like this. / - It's nice.

1683
01:04:03,010 --> 01:04:05,143
It's a great place to visit

1684
01:04:05,143 --> 01:04:06,210
with your parents or your lover.

1685
01:04:06,210 --> 01:04:07,977
It has a great view.

1686
01:04:07,977 --> 01:04:09,977
It's great being somewhere warm on a cold day.

1687
01:04:09,977 --> 01:04:10,743
Exactly.

1688
01:04:10,743 --> 01:04:12,643
Taking photos outside then coming inside

1689
01:04:12,643 --> 01:04:14,643
for coffee.

1690
01:04:15,343 --> 01:04:16,810
Try the coffee.

1691
01:04:19,377 --> 01:04:20,843
- Is it good? / - I'm melting.

1692
01:04:20,843 --> 01:04:21,943
That place was so good.

1693
01:04:21,943 --> 01:04:24,543
Sweet treat after a long walk...

1694
01:04:24,543 --> 01:04:26,710
- It's the best. / - The view makes you...

1695
01:04:26,710 --> 01:04:30,343
Crave for food... With the waves.

1696
01:04:30,343 --> 01:04:32,010
- The cheesecake is so good. / - Right?

1697
01:04:32,010 --> 01:04:34,377
You ate a lot.

1698
01:04:34,377 --> 01:04:37,443
Do you think this is enough?

1699
01:04:37,443 --> 01:04:40,043
It's a battle.

1700
01:04:40,043 --> 01:04:41,577
For a trip in winter...

1701
01:04:42,810 --> 01:04:44,377
This is really well planned.

1702
01:04:44,377 --> 01:04:46,410
It's a cold wave warning.

1703
01:04:46,410 --> 01:04:47,477
It was so cold that day.

1704
01:04:47,477 --> 01:04:48,310
Why do they keep showing this?

1705
01:04:48,310 --> 01:04:50,177
- Look at the vast ocean. / - I know.

1706
01:04:50,177 --> 01:04:52,510
Just sitting in this cafe comforts me.

1707
01:04:52,510 --> 01:04:55,677
- Right? This is healing. / - Yes.

1708
01:04:56,877 --> 01:04:58,743
The sun is going down.

1709
01:04:59,810 --> 01:05:01,543
- It's nice. / - The sunset was...

1710
01:05:01,543 --> 01:05:04,677
- That sunset would be so pretty. / - So pretty.

1711
01:05:05,277 --> 01:05:07,710
You need to be a little relaxed when you're on a trip.

1712
01:05:08,043 --> 01:05:09,943
You shouldn't be too busy.

1713
01:05:10,377 --> 01:05:12,843
Does our train depart at 8 p.m.?

1714
01:05:12,843 --> 01:05:13,977
At 9:30 p.m.

1715
01:05:13,977 --> 01:05:15,510
- It's 9:30 p.m. / - Yes.

1716
01:05:15,510 --> 01:05:18,643
Then how about dinner near Gangneung Station?

1717
01:05:18,643 --> 01:05:20,610
There's a really good restaurant

1718
01:05:20,610 --> 01:05:21,810
near Gangneung Station.

1719
01:05:21,810 --> 01:05:22,677
- Right, you said that yesterday. / - It's famous.

1720
01:05:22,677 --> 01:05:25,810
Most people eat near Anmok Beach.

1721
01:05:25,810 --> 01:05:27,843
- The cafe street. / - Yes, Anmok.

1722
01:05:27,843 --> 01:05:29,710
Where we went was...

1723
01:05:29,710 --> 01:05:33,243
- The original cafe street. / - Jumunjin.

1724
01:05:33,243 --> 01:05:34,310
Gangneung ongsimi.

1725
01:05:34,310 --> 01:05:36,843
Here. This is Gangneung ongsimi.

1726
01:05:36,843 --> 01:05:38,243
Right? It's Korean food.

1727
01:05:38,643 --> 01:05:40,610
- I feel like ongsimi. / - Ongsimi.

1728
01:05:40,610 --> 01:05:42,277
- Potato ongsimi. / - Ongsimi.

1729
01:05:42,277 --> 01:05:44,443
- Namsimi... / - And Jongsimi's...

1730
01:05:44,443 --> 01:05:46,577
Gangneung Tour.

1731
01:05:46,577 --> 01:05:48,010
- Let's go. / - Let's go.

1732
01:05:48,010 --> 01:05:49,710
- Where should we sit? / - Hello.

1733
01:05:49,710 --> 01:05:50,577
Let's sit inside.

1734
01:05:50,577 --> 01:05:52,410
- Let's sit here. / - Okay.

1735
01:05:52,410 --> 01:05:53,010
Come in.

1736
01:05:53,010 --> 01:05:54,877
There's so much to choose from.

1737
01:05:55,377 --> 01:05:57,643
You need alcohol.

1738
01:05:57,910 --> 01:05:59,110
Alcohol.

1739
01:05:59,277 --> 01:06:00,910
The menu calls for a drink.

1740
01:06:00,910 --> 01:06:02,910
The potato fritters are normally called "jeon"

1741
01:06:02,910 --> 01:06:05,410
but they call it "jeok" here.

1742
01:06:05,410 --> 01:06:06,543
Potato jeok.

1743
01:06:06,543 --> 01:06:08,777
Let's order potato jeok and...

1744
01:06:08,777 --> 01:06:11,343
Wait, they don't have ongsimi?

1745
01:06:12,010 --> 01:06:13,043
They don't?

1746
01:06:13,043 --> 01:06:16,577
- I can't read the menu. / - I don't see ongsimi here.

1747
01:06:16,577 --> 01:06:17,710
Why don't they?

1748
01:06:18,910 --> 01:06:21,010
It's next door.

1749
01:06:21,010 --> 01:06:23,910
- You get it from there? / - What?

1750
01:06:23,910 --> 01:06:25,110
- It's a collaboration. / - Collaboration.

1751
01:06:25,110 --> 01:06:27,343
- They're next to each other. / - That's good.

1752
01:06:27,343 --> 01:06:28,777
That's really good.

1753
01:06:28,777 --> 01:06:31,010
- We can have it here? / - Amazing.

1754
01:06:31,010 --> 01:06:32,110
- 2 birds with 1 stone. / - It's not on the menu...

1755
01:06:32,110 --> 01:06:33,977
But we can order it.

1756
01:06:33,977 --> 01:06:36,077
I read on a blog that

1757
01:06:36,077 --> 01:06:39,277
someone had ongsimi here.

1758
01:06:39,277 --> 01:06:40,877
The ongsimi restaurant is next door.

1759
01:06:40,877 --> 01:06:42,910
This is a potato fritter place.

1760
01:06:42,910 --> 01:06:45,243
- We can order it all here? / - Yes, you can.

1761
01:06:45,243 --> 01:06:49,010
We'd like to order ongsimi, potato jeok...

1762
01:06:49,010 --> 01:06:51,410
Potato cake...

1763
01:06:51,410 --> 01:06:53,877
Thistle rice wine.

1764
01:06:54,177 --> 01:06:55,243
Thistle rice wine.

1765
01:06:55,243 --> 01:06:57,410
- It's a rice wine. / - It's good.

1766
01:06:57,710 --> 01:06:59,177
I'll have to have one bowl of rice wine.

1767
01:06:59,177 --> 01:07:00,177
Yeah, just one bowl.

1768
01:07:00,177 --> 01:07:02,510
Because otherwise we'll drink too much.

1769
01:07:04,343 --> 01:07:06,843
(Meanwhile potato jeok is being cooked)

1770
01:07:07,777 --> 01:07:09,210
It looks really delicious.

1771
01:07:09,210 --> 01:07:11,077
It's the perfect dish for rice wine.

1772
01:07:14,710 --> 01:07:15,443
- Looks good. / - It's the ongsimi.

1773
01:07:15,443 --> 01:07:17,477
- That's ongsimi? / - Ongsimi.

1774
01:07:17,477 --> 01:07:19,477
Wow, that looks good.

1775
01:07:19,977 --> 01:07:22,410
- Here you are. / - Thank you.

1776
01:07:24,210 --> 01:07:26,610
It's so big.

1777
01:07:28,477 --> 01:07:30,343
- That looks so good. / - Ongsimi and potato fritter.

1778
01:07:30,343 --> 01:07:32,677
I want to put that on my head.

1779
01:07:33,910 --> 01:07:35,610
- I want to put that on my head. / - So big.

1780
01:07:37,910 --> 01:07:40,743
(Made with 100% home grown potatoes)

1781
01:07:40,743 --> 01:07:42,977
- It's chewy and delicious. / - And this is ongsimi.

1782
01:07:42,977 --> 01:07:44,943
- So it's a hot dish. / - I thought it was ice.

1783
01:07:44,943 --> 01:07:47,043
- Aren't they ice cubes? / - No, they're not.

1784
01:07:47,043 --> 01:07:50,910
(What does transparent ongsimi and broth taste like?)

1785
01:07:52,310 --> 01:07:53,977
- You have to shake the bottle. / - Right.

1786
01:07:53,977 --> 01:07:56,810
- Because the yeast is at the bottom. / - You're right.

1787
01:07:56,810 --> 01:07:58,143
Let me pour you one.

1788
01:08:00,310 --> 01:08:02,243
- Do I just pour like this? / - Okay.

1789
01:08:04,877 --> 01:08:06,377
Okay, stop.

1790
01:08:06,943 --> 01:08:08,877
(Seongjong fills up with water instead of alcohol)

1791
01:08:09,710 --> 01:08:10,577
- Cheers / - Cheers.

1792
01:08:10,577 --> 01:08:13,343
That day, Woohyun drank a lot because it was good.

1793
01:08:13,343 --> 01:08:16,277
- It was delicious. / - So nice to drink on TV.

1794
01:08:16,277 --> 01:08:18,910
- It's your first time, right? / - Yes. It's nice.

1795
01:08:18,910 --> 01:08:21,143
I'll have a bowl. I apologize.

1796
01:08:21,143 --> 01:08:24,010
I'll gulp down some rice wine.

1797
01:08:25,243 --> 01:08:27,743
This is nice. This is the joy of life.

1798
01:08:29,277 --> 01:08:31,310
- What's more to life? / - It's sweet.

1799
01:08:31,310 --> 01:08:32,143
Is it?

1800
01:08:32,143 --> 01:08:34,010
I'm a really picky eater.

1801
01:08:34,010 --> 01:08:35,777
But that day, I ate a lot.

1802
01:08:35,777 --> 01:08:37,043
The potato fritter...

1803
01:08:37,043 --> 01:08:40,943
- I want to try ongsimi. / - I was so curious.

1804
01:08:40,977 --> 01:08:43,743
I've never heard of ongsimi.

1805
01:08:43,743 --> 01:08:46,110
Right. The youngsters...

1806
01:08:46,110 --> 01:08:49,143
- Won't know what ongsimi is. / - They won't know.

1807
01:08:49,943 --> 01:08:51,810
It has potato...

1808
01:08:52,177 --> 01:08:54,243
The broth is made of mussels.

1809
01:08:55,077 --> 01:08:58,277
- The broth is mussels? / - Yes, normally it's anchovy.

1810
01:08:58,277 --> 01:08:59,077
But it's mussels there.

1811
01:08:59,077 --> 01:09:01,310
- Yes, it was mussel broth. / - It must be refreshing.

1812
01:09:01,310 --> 01:09:02,377
It was really refreshing.

1813
01:09:04,110 --> 01:09:05,610
- Is it good? / - It's good.

1814
01:09:08,210 --> 01:09:08,410
It is good.

1815
01:09:08,410 --> 01:09:10,510
We didn't go there for a show.

1816
01:09:10,510 --> 01:09:13,510
- We went on a healing trip. / - By ourselves.

1817
01:09:14,610 --> 01:09:17,343
This tastes familiar. What is this flavor?

1818
01:09:17,343 --> 01:09:19,310
- I know. / - What is this taste?

1819
01:09:19,777 --> 01:09:21,643
(Woohyun carefully tastes it)

1820
01:09:22,277 --> 01:09:23,677
I remember. I remember.

1821
01:09:23,677 --> 01:09:25,177
- What is it? / - I remember now.

1822
01:09:25,543 --> 01:09:28,043
I've been thinking it tastes like mussels.

1823
01:09:28,043 --> 01:09:29,677
- There are mussels in it? / - There are mussels in it.

1824
01:09:29,677 --> 01:09:33,877
It tastes like seafood knife-cut noodles with ongsimi.

1825
01:09:35,010 --> 01:09:36,943
I'm so curious to try potato fritter.

1826
01:09:36,943 --> 01:09:38,310
Dip it in the soy sauce.

1827
01:09:38,310 --> 01:09:39,543
I love noodles and fritters.

1828
01:09:39,543 --> 01:09:42,377
I think I should go eat that today after this shoot.

1829
01:09:42,377 --> 01:09:43,343
Dip it and...

1830
01:09:45,610 --> 01:09:47,043
How's it?

1831
01:09:47,043 --> 01:09:48,210
Does it taste good?

1832
01:09:48,210 --> 01:09:49,577
(This is it!)

1833
01:09:49,577 --> 01:09:50,010
You can't explain?

1834
01:09:50,010 --> 01:09:51,743
It's made 100% of potatoes.

1835
01:09:51,943 --> 01:09:54,577
- It's delicious. / - I'll dip it in the sauce.

1836
01:09:54,577 --> 01:09:56,543
(He eats a piece of radish kimchi)

1837
01:09:58,810 --> 01:10:00,177
I feel happy now.

1838
01:10:00,977 --> 01:10:03,477
What's good about the dishes we had

1839
01:10:03,477 --> 01:10:04,910
is that anyone would love them.

1840
01:10:04,910 --> 01:10:07,877
- They're mild. / - Yes, they are mild.

1841
01:10:07,877 --> 01:10:09,177
- It's delicious, isn't it? / - Yes.

1842
01:10:09,177 --> 01:10:11,910
It's very soft and savory.

1843
01:10:11,910 --> 01:10:15,543
They added some peppers to make it less heavy.

1844
01:10:15,910 --> 01:10:19,743
- The essential thing is... / - What is it?

1845
01:10:19,743 --> 01:10:21,143
This kimchi.

1846
01:10:21,143 --> 01:10:24,877
Kimchi represents the taste of the restaurant.

1847
01:10:24,877 --> 01:10:26,610
That's true. Kimchi tastes different everywhere.

1848
01:10:26,610 --> 01:10:28,810
You have a way around good restaurants.

1849
01:10:28,810 --> 01:10:31,610
This kimchi is perfectly matured.

1850
01:10:31,610 --> 01:10:33,110
Kimchi is tasty as well.

1851
01:10:33,277 --> 01:10:35,543
I'd love to come here again.

1852
01:10:35,543 --> 01:10:38,177
- It wasn't easy to find this restaurant. / - I know.

1853
01:10:38,777 --> 01:10:40,177
(Shaking)

1854
01:10:41,110 --> 01:10:42,243
It's good.

1855
01:10:43,877 --> 01:10:45,177
Thank you.

1856
01:10:45,177 --> 01:10:47,210
- Potato cakes. / - Potato cakes.

1857
01:10:47,477 --> 01:10:47,943
Wow, it's transparent.

1858
01:10:47,943 --> 01:10:50,210
- Oh, they had that left. / - There was more?

1859
01:10:50,210 --> 01:10:53,677
- They're potato cakes. / - They're very see-through.

1860
01:10:54,043 --> 01:10:56,110
They're made using potatoes.

1861
01:10:56,110 --> 01:10:58,243
That's why they're transparent.

1862
01:10:58,410 --> 01:11:00,977
And they have perilla oil on the outside.

1863
01:11:00,977 --> 01:11:02,710
So it was really savory.

1864
01:11:07,777 --> 01:11:08,610
Is it good?

1865
01:11:09,777 --> 01:11:11,010
How are the potato cakes?

1866
01:11:11,010 --> 01:11:14,010
The texture is amazing.

1867
01:11:14,010 --> 01:11:15,077
Is it?

1868
01:11:15,643 --> 01:11:17,143
Listen to the sound.

1869
01:11:18,243 --> 01:11:19,477
I know.

1870
01:11:19,477 --> 01:11:23,710
- You can't force this sound. / - It sounds very chewy.

1871
01:11:23,710 --> 01:11:25,243
- It's very chewy. / - I see.

1872
01:11:25,243 --> 01:11:28,110
Are those beans inside?

1873
01:11:28,277 --> 01:11:29,910
They go perfect with each other.

1874
01:11:29,910 --> 01:11:30,910
- They do? / - Yeah.

1875
01:11:30,910 --> 01:11:32,510
This is perfect for rice wine.

1876
01:11:32,510 --> 01:11:35,210
Just drink as much as you want.

1877
01:11:35,210 --> 01:11:37,577
Since you drove all day.

1878
01:11:37,577 --> 01:11:39,243
I'll drive on the way home.

1879
01:11:39,243 --> 01:11:41,610
Since it wasn't a long drive back.

1880
01:11:41,610 --> 01:11:43,910
He pretended to care about me.

1881
01:11:44,443 --> 01:11:46,910
Since it's a very short distance.

1882
01:11:50,110 --> 01:11:51,877
(Order one more bottle of rice wine)

1883
01:11:52,277 --> 01:11:54,010
- He drinks so well. / - He does.

1884
01:11:54,010 --> 01:11:56,777
I've never seen Woohyun drink rice wine that well.

1885
01:11:56,777 --> 01:11:58,977
It's like he's been waiting to get drunk.

1886
01:11:58,977 --> 01:12:00,677
It was so good.

1887
01:12:00,677 --> 01:12:02,610
Seongjong!

1888
01:12:02,610 --> 01:12:04,443
Seongjong!

1889
01:12:04,810 --> 01:12:06,977
Where did this grandpa come from?

1890
01:12:06,977 --> 01:12:08,910
- I'm drunk. / - You're drunk?

1891
01:12:09,910 --> 01:12:11,977
(I feel so good today)

1892
01:12:15,643 --> 01:12:18,377
Woohyun, we ate so well

1893
01:12:18,377 --> 01:12:19,843
and had a lot of fun today.

1894
01:12:19,843 --> 01:12:22,743
It was so good to be on this trip.

1895
01:12:22,743 --> 01:12:24,743
We saw beautiful scenery...

1896
01:12:24,743 --> 01:12:27,077
I think their trip would be great for couples.

1897
01:12:27,077 --> 01:12:29,210
It'd be great for couples.

1898
01:12:29,210 --> 01:12:31,210
It's breathtaking.

1899
01:12:31,210 --> 01:12:33,477
We went to the "Guardian" shoot location.

1900
01:12:33,477 --> 01:12:34,277
We went there...

1901
01:12:34,277 --> 01:12:37,143
Then we had some coffee there.

1902
01:12:37,143 --> 01:12:39,477
For dinner, we had rice wine.

1903
01:12:39,477 --> 01:12:41,843
- And met these ongsimi friends. / - Right.

1904
01:12:41,843 --> 01:12:43,643
- Right, Jongsim? / - Yes, Namsim.

1905
01:12:43,643 --> 01:12:45,077
- Right, Jongsim? / - Namsim.

1906
01:12:45,077 --> 01:12:46,677
- That's right. / - Okay, right.

1907
01:12:47,143 --> 01:12:49,943
I wrote down the expenses for the day.

1908
01:12:49,943 --> 01:12:54,077
We spent $79 in total.

1909
01:12:54,610 --> 01:12:56,210
What's going on?

1910
01:12:56,210 --> 01:12:59,477
We had so much money left.

1911
01:12:59,643 --> 01:13:01,177
Was our raw fish too expensive?

1912
01:13:01,510 --> 01:13:03,877
We could've had one more member on the trip.

1913
01:13:04,677 --> 01:13:06,443
Let's have one last bowl and leave.

1914
01:13:06,443 --> 01:13:09,777
- Namsimi... Cheers. / - Jongsimi, cheers.

1915
01:13:19,510 --> 01:13:20,710
Nice.

1916
01:13:20,810 --> 01:13:23,677
People only think of Jeju-do

1917
01:13:23,677 --> 01:13:25,410
when it comes to coastal roads.

1918
01:13:25,410 --> 01:13:26,910
But there's one in Gangneung as well.

1919
01:13:26,910 --> 01:13:28,910
It's called Heonhwa Road.

1920
01:13:28,910 --> 01:13:32,710
From Geumjin Beach to Jeongdongjin, it's 8km long.

1921
01:13:32,710 --> 01:13:35,010
It's really nice to drive on.

1922
01:13:35,010 --> 01:13:37,243
So it'd be great to experience that.

1923
01:13:37,243 --> 01:13:39,377
The prettiest part there

1924
01:13:39,377 --> 01:13:42,843
is Simgok Harbor in Geumjin.

1925
01:13:42,843 --> 01:13:44,543
- Simgok Harbor. / - Yes, if you drive there...

1926
01:13:44,543 --> 01:13:45,977
It's another 2.3km.

1927
01:13:45,977 --> 01:13:47,510
- It's not that long. / - No, it's not.

1928
01:13:47,510 --> 01:13:49,543
- That's a short drive. / - You can walk there too.

1929
01:13:49,543 --> 01:13:51,743
It's great for a drive.

1930
01:13:51,743 --> 01:13:54,743
That's where we traveled.

1931
01:13:54,743 --> 01:13:56,643
The Badabuchae-gil

1932
01:13:56,643 --> 01:14:00,277
was opened in June, 2017

1933
01:14:00,277 --> 01:14:03,443
as a coastal defense site.

1934
01:14:03,443 --> 01:14:04,277
It's a total hot place.

1935
01:14:04,277 --> 01:14:06,343
- So it hasn't been open for long. / - Only a year.

1936
01:14:06,343 --> 01:14:08,143
You couldn't drive there before.

1937
01:14:08,143 --> 01:14:10,177
You're not allowed to take photos there.

1938
01:14:10,177 --> 01:14:13,143
- But everywhere else is fine. / - It's a military base.

1939
01:14:13,143 --> 01:14:14,177
Just the military areas.

1940
01:14:14,177 --> 01:14:15,543
So you have to see for yourself.

1941
01:14:15,543 --> 01:14:17,943
- Yes, go for yourself. / - Since you can't take photos.

1942
01:14:17,943 --> 01:14:19,910
One thing I felt was

1943
01:14:19,910 --> 01:14:21,310
that SEVENTEEN's trip was...

1944
01:14:21,310 --> 01:14:23,577
- A very youthful trip. / - So much energy.

1945
01:14:23,577 --> 01:14:25,077
It was energetic and passionate.

1946
01:14:25,077 --> 01:14:28,377
But from INFINITE, I could feel a sense of age.

1947
01:14:28,377 --> 01:14:30,143
- We were relaxed. / - Not age..

1948
01:14:30,143 --> 01:14:31,510
Age?

1949
01:14:31,510 --> 01:14:33,277
You mean they had no energy?

1950
01:14:33,277 --> 01:14:34,677
No, no.

1951
01:14:34,677 --> 01:14:38,110
If a trip is really busy and exhausting,

1952
01:14:38,110 --> 01:14:39,010
you get tired in one day.

1953
01:14:39,010 --> 01:14:41,543
You need 3 days to take it easy.

1954
01:14:41,543 --> 01:14:42,843
- And take it slow. / - Right.

1955
01:14:42,843 --> 01:14:45,977
