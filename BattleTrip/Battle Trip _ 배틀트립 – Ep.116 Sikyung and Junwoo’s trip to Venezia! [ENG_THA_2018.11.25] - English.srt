00:00:21,841 --> 00:00:22,908
Welcome.

00:00:23,708 --> 00:00:26,141
Welcome to Battle Trip Restaurant

00:00:26,141 --> 00:00:29,141

(We invite you to the world of gastronomy) 

12
00:01:01,441 --> 00:01:03,308
This really is the city of water. 

13
00:01:03,308 --> 00:01:04,841
This really feels like Italy. 

14
00:01:10,441 --> 00:01:13,174

We've arrived here! 

18
00:01:24,441 --> 00:01:25,841
Wow, this is to die for. 

19
00:01:27,341 --> 00:01:29,974
It's not famous among tourists. 

20
00:01:29,974 --> 00:01:31,208
Where we can eat... 

21
00:01:32,908 --> 00:01:34,641
(Which team will be the winners of this gourmet trip?) 

22
00:01:34,641 --> 00:01:36,341

Battle Trip! 

24
00:01:43,908 --> 00:01:46,841
We have special episodes every week 

25
00:01:46,841 --> 00:01:48,541
but this is even more special. 

26
00:01:48,874 --> 00:01:51,974
With our two hosts, Lee Hwijae and Sung Sikyung, 

27
00:01:51,974 --> 00:01:54,074
we prepared a special battle between the hosts. 

28
00:01:54,074 --> 00:01:55,774
(The host battle is back) 

29
00:01:55,774 --> 00:01:58,308
Hwijae, please tell us about this episode. 

30
00:01:58,308 --> 00:02:00,874
We went on a trip for food, literally. 

31
00:02:00,874 --> 00:02:03,374
We have two chefs who traveled with us. 

32
00:02:03,374 --> 00:02:05,041
They are Lee Wonil and Park Joonwoo. 

33
00:02:05,041 --> 00:02:05,908
(Two chefs to adorn the gourmet trip) 

34
00:02:08,474 --> 00:02:09,974
We have the best chefs here. 

35
00:02:09,974 --> 00:02:12,374
And today, for this special episode, 

36
00:02:12,374 --> 00:02:14,841
we invited special judges here. 

37
00:02:14,841 --> 00:02:17,041
They are Lovelyz and PENTAGON. Welcome. 

38
00:02:18,808 --> 00:02:20,208
(Lovelyz) 

39
00:02:20,208 --> 00:02:21,808
I'm a little worried 

40
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:24,374
because Hwijae doesn't eat a lot. 

41
00:02:24,374 --> 00:02:25,941
- I'm very picky. / - But... 

42
00:02:25,941 --> 00:02:27,841
When I heard Wonil went with you, 

43
00:02:27,841 --> 00:02:28,941
I felt relieved. 

44
00:02:28,941 --> 00:02:30,741
I have a close tie with him. 

45
00:02:30,741 --> 00:02:32,708
Wonil is acknowledged 

46
00:02:32,708 --> 00:02:35,341
to be the best Korean chef in the country. 

47
00:02:35,341 --> 00:02:37,874
He's the best... 

48
00:02:37,874 --> 00:02:40,274
- When it comes to eating. / - Right. 

49
00:02:40,274 --> 00:02:42,208
During my trip with him, 

50
00:02:42,208 --> 00:02:44,108
I thought he didn't have a throat. 

51
00:02:44,108 --> 00:02:45,574
(He just kept eating) 

52
00:02:45,574 --> 00:02:47,508
He's Lee Wonil. 

53
00:02:47,941 --> 00:02:50,074
Hello, hello. 

54
00:02:50,074 --> 00:02:52,474
Nice to meet you. I'm Chef Lee Wonil. 

55
00:02:52,474 --> 00:02:54,041
First of all, 

56
00:02:54,041 --> 00:02:55,774
it's important to eat a lot 

57
00:02:55,774 --> 00:02:58,208
but it's more important to know what we eat. 

58
00:02:58,208 --> 00:03:00,908
He used to be a journalist. 

59
00:03:00,908 --> 00:03:04,041
He has an extensive knowledge of Western food. 

60
00:03:04,041 --> 00:03:05,474
And he's a wine expert. 

61
00:03:06,508 --> 00:03:07,841
You'll be surprised. 

62
00:03:07,841 --> 00:03:10,241
Sometimes, he brings wine speaking in French. 

63
00:03:10,241 --> 00:03:12,641
I understand. He studied in Belgium. 

64
00:03:12,641 --> 00:03:14,674
- He's Chef Park Joonwoo. / - Welcome. 

65
00:03:14,674 --> 00:03:16,641
(Chef Park Joonwoo) 

66
00:03:17,208 --> 00:03:19,808
The important thing about travel 

67
00:03:19,808 --> 00:03:21,841
is the destination. 

68
00:03:21,841 --> 00:03:24,241
But it also matters who you're going with. 

69
00:03:24,241 --> 00:03:27,341
I was going to make a team with Wonil but 

70
00:03:27,341 --> 00:03:28,908
I was told we can't go through immigration that way. 

71
00:03:29,541 --> 00:03:31,074
- No one can stop you from eating. / - That's right. 

72
00:03:31,374 --> 00:03:33,608
They are matchless. They can't be together. 

73
00:03:33,608 --> 00:03:34,674
Who'd be able to beat them? 

74
00:03:34,674 --> 00:03:36,041
No one can beat them. 

75
00:03:36,808 --> 00:03:38,308
Maybe Kang Hodong and Lee Yeongja. 

76
00:03:38,308 --> 00:03:39,574
(Hodong and Yeongja might be able to beat them) 

77
00:03:39,574 --> 00:03:41,041
They can give it a try. 

78
00:03:41,041 --> 00:03:42,674
They're like Messi and Ronaldo. 

79
00:03:42,674 --> 00:03:44,074
You're right. 

80
00:03:44,074 --> 00:03:45,874
There are flags here. 

81
00:03:45,874 --> 00:03:47,541
This is Italy vs. Spain. 

82
00:03:47,541 --> 00:03:48,708
- That's right. / - What's important is... 

83
00:03:48,708 --> 00:03:51,008
Which city of Spain you went. 

84
00:03:51,008 --> 00:03:54,508
And which city of Italy you went is very important. 

85
00:03:54,508 --> 00:03:57,108
Which city of Italy did you go to? 

86
00:03:57,108 --> 00:03:59,874
It's the city of water and romance. 

87
00:03:59,874 --> 00:04:02,141
We went to Venice. 

88
00:04:02,141 --> 00:04:05,008
We went to one more city. It's the city of gastronomy. 

89
00:04:05,008 --> 00:04:06,408
It's called the city of fatties. 

90
00:04:06,408 --> 00:04:07,541
Fatties? 

91
00:04:08,108 --> 00:04:09,908
It's Bologna La Grassa. 

92
00:04:09,908 --> 00:04:11,508
It's the city of fatties. 

93
00:04:11,508 --> 00:04:13,041
You have to eat there. 

94
00:04:13,041 --> 00:04:14,608
There are many tasty things. 

95
00:04:15,941 --> 00:04:18,841
If you go on a gourmet trip to Italy, 

96
00:04:18,841 --> 00:04:20,474
all cities are perfect for that. 

97
00:04:20,474 --> 00:04:22,574
But you should go to Venice with a lot of seafood. 

98
00:04:23,108 --> 00:04:26,708
And Bologna, a center of trade. 

99
00:04:26,708 --> 00:04:29,741
They have the best food ingredients there. 

100
00:04:29,741 --> 00:04:31,508
If you want to enjoy gastronomy, 

101
00:04:31,508 --> 00:04:32,874
you should go to Bologna. 

102
00:04:33,808 --> 00:04:35,474
The judges seem... 

103
00:04:35,474 --> 00:04:37,974
- Quite tempted by Italy. / - I'd go for Italy. 

104
00:04:37,974 --> 00:04:41,341
They catch seafood at the sea and deep-fry it. 

105
00:04:41,808 --> 00:04:44,041
(Deep-frying?) 

106
00:04:44,908 --> 00:04:47,408
- It must be good. / - There's no need to say more. 

107
00:04:47,408 --> 00:04:50,308
Alright, Team Spain. 

108
00:04:50,308 --> 00:04:52,041
Which city did you go to? 

109
00:04:52,041 --> 00:04:53,474
When you think of Spain, 

110
00:04:53,474 --> 00:04:55,174
which city comes to your mind? 

111
00:04:55,174 --> 00:04:56,974
- Barcelona. / - Barcelona. 

112
00:04:56,974 --> 00:04:58,708
Barcelona! 

113
00:04:58,708 --> 00:04:59,774
Barcelona. 

114
00:04:59,774 --> 00:05:01,008
Messi plays for FC Barcelona. 

115
00:05:01,408 --> 00:05:03,441
And Valencia. 

116
00:05:03,441 --> 00:05:05,541
Lee Kangin plays for Valencia FC. 

117
00:05:06,641 --> 00:05:07,508
Enough. 

118
00:05:07,508 --> 00:05:09,908
But I gave up everything. 

119
00:05:09,908 --> 00:05:11,908
I focused on the food. 

120
00:05:11,908 --> 00:05:13,508
It's where gourmets from all over the world 

121
00:05:13,508 --> 00:05:14,374
want to go. 

122
00:05:14,374 --> 00:05:17,374
Barcelona is the battlefield of the best chefs, 

123
00:05:17,374 --> 00:05:18,641
so they say. 

124
00:05:18,974 --> 00:05:22,108
La Boqueria in Barcelona is called 

125
00:05:22,108 --> 00:05:24,108
the shopping basket of Europe. 

126
00:05:24,108 --> 00:05:27,741
There are a lot of food ingredients 

127
00:05:27,741 --> 00:05:29,241
in Barcelona. 

128
00:05:29,241 --> 00:05:32,608
We also visited Valencia, a hidden gourmet city. 

129
00:05:32,608 --> 00:05:34,674
- Valencia sounds unfamiliar. / - I know. 

130
00:05:34,674 --> 00:05:37,608
Valencia is where the typical Spanish dish... 

131
00:05:37,608 --> 00:05:40,141
- Paella was invented. / - Paella. 

132
00:05:40,141 --> 00:05:41,741
That's Valencia. 

133
00:05:41,741 --> 00:05:44,274
Now let me sum it up. 

134
00:05:44,274 --> 00:05:47,108
There will be matches between two cities. 

135
00:05:47,108 --> 00:05:49,041
One match is between Venice, Italy 

136
00:05:49,041 --> 00:05:51,141
and Barcelona, Spain. 

137
00:05:51,141 --> 00:05:53,108
And the other is between Bologna, Italy... 

138
00:05:53,108 --> 00:05:56,508
- And Valencia, Spain. / - Valencia. 

139
00:05:57,241 --> 00:06:00,308
The matches will be judged by our impartial judges. 

140
00:06:00,308 --> 00:06:03,108
Until now, our 100 judges were allowed 

141
00:06:03,108 --> 00:06:04,941
to vote for both teams. 

142
00:06:04,941 --> 00:06:07,074
But today, after watching the two cities, 

143
00:06:07,074 --> 00:06:09,508
the judges have to choose only one city 

144
00:06:09,508 --> 00:06:10,841
they'd like to go. 

145
00:06:10,841 --> 00:06:11,841
They can only vote for one team. 

146
00:06:11,841 --> 00:06:15,374
We have 8 judges and Sook, our main host. 

147
00:06:15,374 --> 00:06:18,541
- Including her vote... / - If we have only 8 judges... 

148
00:06:18,541 --> 00:06:20,774
It might end up tie with the score of 4 to 4. 

149
00:06:20,941 --> 00:06:23,774
If I vote as well, it will be an odd number. 

150
00:06:23,774 --> 00:06:26,308
I believe Sook will be honest and vote for... 

151
00:06:26,308 --> 00:06:27,741
- What she likes. / - Of course. 

152
00:06:27,741 --> 00:06:30,041
I'm very honest when it comes to food. 

153
00:06:30,041 --> 00:06:32,274
Let's forget about seniority here. 

154
00:06:32,274 --> 00:06:34,908
I hope you focus on 

155
00:06:34,908 --> 00:06:36,374
the food only. 

156
00:06:36,374 --> 00:06:39,474
We're here as gourmet judges 

157
00:06:39,474 --> 00:06:41,041
but we got nothing but some bread. 

158
00:06:41,041 --> 00:06:41,908
Aren't we getting any food? 

159
00:06:43,208 --> 00:06:45,341
- All we get is bread? / - We want food too. 

160
00:06:45,941 --> 00:06:47,708
Since we started talking about food, 

161
00:06:47,708 --> 00:06:49,908
we're getting hungry. 

162
00:06:49,908 --> 00:06:52,441
We're about to go on a gourmet tour. 

163
00:06:52,741 --> 00:06:55,641
And we can't on empty stomachs. 

164
00:06:56,274 --> 00:06:57,341
So I prepared something. 

165
00:06:59,841 --> 00:07:01,374
Please bring the food. 

166
00:07:01,808 --> 00:07:03,508
(Prepared for the gourmet trip) 

167
00:07:03,508 --> 00:07:05,008
(Today's appetizer) 

168
00:07:06,074 --> 00:07:08,974
(Jamon and salami) 

169
00:07:10,441 --> 00:07:11,974
Jamon was invented before 

170
00:07:11,974 --> 00:07:14,308
refrigeration was developed. 

171
00:07:14,308 --> 00:07:17,041
In order to keep meat from rotting for a long time, 

172
00:07:17,041 --> 00:07:19,308
people dry-cured meat, which is how 

173
00:07:19,308 --> 00:07:20,541
jamon was invented. 

174
00:07:20,541 --> 00:07:23,941
In other words, it's salted pork. 

175
00:07:23,941 --> 00:07:26,408
The jamon we prepared today is 

176
00:07:26,408 --> 00:07:29,208
not just regular jamon. 

177
00:07:29,208 --> 00:07:32,608
It's the best quality jamon. It's called jamon iberico. 

178
00:07:32,608 --> 00:07:35,474
It's made of a pig's hind leg that was fed acorns. 

179
00:07:35,474 --> 00:07:38,508
It's not so salty and it has an excellent nutty flavor. 

180
00:07:38,508 --> 00:07:39,874
We prepared jamon iberico today. 

181
00:07:39,874 --> 00:07:42,074
Do you see the bread in front of you? 

182
00:07:42,341 --> 00:07:44,608
It will taste amazing 

183
00:07:44,608 --> 00:07:46,574
with the bread. 

184
00:07:46,574 --> 00:07:48,274
It'll be perfectly seasoned. 

185
00:07:48,274 --> 00:07:50,141
Why does it smell like sesame oil? 

186
00:07:50,841 --> 00:07:54,408
- It's the lard. / - The oily scent is... 

187
00:07:54,408 --> 00:07:56,341
From the acorns. 

188
00:07:56,341 --> 00:07:59,808
You can smell the acorns from the fat. 

189
00:07:59,808 --> 00:08:02,308
- I can smell it. / - I can really smell acorns. 

190
00:08:03,508 --> 00:08:05,274
We prepared salami. 

191
00:08:05,274 --> 00:08:08,708
Salami was invented by farmers like jamon. 

192
00:08:08,708 --> 00:08:10,808
It's also dry-cured ham. 

193
00:08:10,808 --> 00:08:12,974
Salami is where all the dry-cured hams 

194
00:08:12,974 --> 00:08:15,408
were originated from. 

195
00:08:15,408 --> 00:08:17,708
- It's a very meaningful food. / - Right. 

196
00:08:17,708 --> 00:08:20,708
The word "salami" comes from a Latin word "salare." 

197
00:08:20,708 --> 00:08:23,108
It means to salt. 

198
00:08:23,108 --> 00:08:25,308
Pepperoni on pizza is also 

199
00:08:25,308 --> 00:08:26,541
a kind of salami. 

200
00:08:29,274 --> 00:08:31,941
Both are really delicious. 

201
00:08:31,941 --> 00:08:33,308
- They have different charms. / - How is it? 

202
00:08:33,308 --> 00:08:34,574
- Which one do you prefer? / - For me... 

203
00:08:34,574 --> 00:08:37,874
- I like fat on meat. / - I see. 

204
00:08:37,874 --> 00:08:40,441
I prefer salami because it tastes fattier. 

205
00:08:40,441 --> 00:08:41,974
So you prefer salami. 

206
00:08:42,574 --> 00:08:43,808
What about you? 

207
00:08:43,808 --> 00:08:45,741
The PENTAGON members are so busy eating. 

208
00:08:45,741 --> 00:08:46,608
(Focused on eating) 

209
00:08:46,608 --> 00:08:48,174
- It's tasty, isn't it? / - Together with bread... 

210
00:08:48,174 --> 00:08:50,441
Salami makes your mouth keep watering. 

211
00:08:51,408 --> 00:08:52,608
Which country do you want to check out first? 

212
00:08:53,508 --> 00:08:55,408
- Italy. / - Spain. 

213
00:08:55,408 --> 00:08:57,041
- Italy. / - Italy? I see. 

214
00:08:57,041 --> 00:08:59,008
It seems like the majority want to see Italy first. 

215
00:08:59,008 --> 00:09:00,441
You have to eat delicious food first. 

216
00:09:02,174 --> 00:09:04,274
This is just a small part of what we had there. 

217
00:09:04,274 --> 00:09:06,741
Brioche, espresso, cappuccino, 

218
00:09:06,741 --> 00:09:08,741
squid ink pasta, deep-fried seafood, 

219
00:09:08,741 --> 00:09:10,574
Spritz, Lugana white wine, 

220
00:09:10,574 --> 00:09:12,774
pizza diavola, pizza quattro stagioni, arugula pizza... 

221
00:09:13,274 --> 00:09:15,341
Caprese salad, monkfish, spaghetti alle vongole, 

222
00:09:15,341 --> 00:09:16,874
Venetian style liver, 

223
00:09:16,874 --> 00:09:19,641
Sangiovese red wine. Those are what we had. 

224
00:09:19,641 --> 00:09:22,041
We know some of the dishes on the list 

225
00:09:22,041 --> 00:09:22,841
but some of them we don't. 

226
00:09:22,841 --> 00:09:25,074
If you have any question, feel free to ask. 

227
00:09:25,074 --> 00:09:27,574
I wonder what Spritz is. 

228
00:09:27,574 --> 00:09:29,774
It sounds like... 

229
00:09:30,308 --> 00:09:31,508
A fizzy drink. 

230
00:09:31,508 --> 00:09:36,374
Spritz is a very famous aperitif in Venice. 

231
00:09:36,374 --> 00:09:40,374
- Aperitif? / - It's made with a strong liquor... 

232
00:09:40,374 --> 00:09:42,208
And carbonated water. 

233
00:09:42,208 --> 00:09:44,674
You can make it either bitter or sweet. 

234
00:09:44,674 --> 00:09:46,141
There are two kinds of Spritz. 

235
00:09:46,141 --> 00:09:49,908
We got you a glass of Spritz for each of you. 

236
00:09:50,508 --> 00:09:52,308
- Aperitifs. / - Let's drink it before we start. 

237
00:09:52,308 --> 00:09:53,708
(A glass of Spritz before the journey starts) 

238
00:09:55,474 --> 00:09:56,874
It looks so pretty. 

239
00:09:58,508 --> 00:10:00,141
It smells very refreshing. 

240
00:10:00,941 --> 00:10:03,674
It has a very sweet liquor in it called Aperol. 

241
00:10:03,674 --> 00:10:06,208
It's sweet Spritz. 

242
00:10:06,208 --> 00:10:09,141
This is what most people like. 

243
00:10:09,141 --> 00:10:11,608
It has carbonated water and ice cubes in it, 

244
00:10:11,608 --> 00:10:13,308
so it'll be less and less alcoholic as time passes. 

245
00:10:13,474 --> 00:10:16,674
It smells like a fizzy drink or... 

246
00:10:17,074 --> 00:10:19,374
A digestive medicine. 

247
00:10:19,374 --> 00:10:20,441
Do you see what I mean? 

248
00:10:20,441 --> 00:10:21,674
- Right? / - I know what you mean. 

249
00:10:21,674 --> 00:10:24,074
- I know that medicine. / - It smells like that medicine. 

250
00:10:24,074 --> 00:10:25,574
There's one thing you should know. 

251
00:10:25,574 --> 00:10:29,941
It has liquor in it, which is a strong alcohol. 

252
00:10:30,274 --> 00:10:33,408
It's brewed with herbs and spices. 

253
00:10:33,408 --> 00:10:35,241
Herbs and spices used to be 

254
00:10:35,241 --> 00:10:37,108
used as medicine for digestion. 

255
00:10:37,108 --> 00:10:39,074
So they might smell similar. 

256
00:10:39,074 --> 00:10:41,074
You don't drink a lot of this. 

257
00:10:41,074 --> 00:10:42,841
You moisten your throat with this 

258
00:10:42,841 --> 00:10:44,674
before you start eating. 

259
00:10:44,674 --> 00:10:46,474
This is why it's like a digestive medicine. 

260
00:10:46,474 --> 00:10:49,008
It helps your stomach get ready. 

261
00:10:49,374 --> 00:10:52,374
Yein doesn't seem to like it. 

262
00:10:52,374 --> 00:10:54,974
I like drinks that taste a lot like alcohol. 

263
00:10:56,474 --> 00:10:58,874
- This is too weak for her. / - She wants it stronger. 

264
00:10:59,274 --> 00:11:02,074
Now that we had an aperitif, 

265
00:11:02,074 --> 00:11:02,974
let's get started. 

266
00:11:02,974 --> 00:11:04,741
Before that, the corner inside a corner, 

267
00:11:04,741 --> 00:11:06,108
Sook's Choice. 

268
00:11:06,108 --> 00:11:08,074
Since the theme is gourmet trip, 

269
00:11:08,074 --> 00:11:09,674
there will be a lot of food. 

270
00:11:09,674 --> 00:11:13,008
I'm going to share how I change my mind 

271
00:11:13,008 --> 00:11:15,941
with you in real-time. 

272
00:11:15,941 --> 00:11:19,308
Now, we're going to go on a trip. 

273
00:11:19,308 --> 00:11:22,808
Excuse me, is "now" a new buzzword? 

274
00:11:24,408 --> 00:11:26,874
Before we start, let's hear your tour names. 

275
00:11:26,874 --> 00:11:28,774
- Want our tour name? / - Yes. 

276
00:11:28,774 --> 00:11:30,741
Pizza, pasta, espresso, wine, risotto, gelato, 

277
00:11:30,741 --> 00:11:31,774
deep-fried seafood, 

278
00:11:31,774 --> 00:11:34,441
Bolognese sauce, tortellini, mortadella steak. 

279
00:11:35,408 --> 00:11:37,241
We Will Eat Tour. 

280
00:11:37,908 --> 00:11:41,508
(The trip to Venice begins) 

281
00:11:41,508 --> 00:11:42,741
(1 of the top 3 countries of gastronomy) 

282
00:11:42,741 --> 00:11:44,508
Is it 1 of the top 3 countries of gastronomy? 

283
00:11:44,508 --> 00:11:45,841
(Italy) 

284
00:11:47,108 --> 00:11:48,608
It's so beautiful. 

285
00:11:48,608 --> 00:11:51,908
(It's the only city of water in the world) 

286
00:11:52,241 --> 00:11:54,208
It looks different. 

287
00:11:54,208 --> 00:11:56,008
(Venice) 

288
00:11:56,974 --> 00:11:57,808
(Italy's) 

289
00:11:58,674 --> 00:12:00,741
(It looks amazing) 

290
00:12:03,308 --> 00:12:08,274
(Italy's capital city of gastronomy) 

291
00:12:09,408 --> 00:12:14,108
(Bologna) 

292
00:12:14,108 --> 00:12:17,874
(Welcome to the gourmet world) 

293
00:12:17,874 --> 00:12:19,574
Truffles. 

294
00:12:19,574 --> 00:12:21,574
- Italy is famous for truffles. / - Italian truffles. 

295
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:23,474
They look delicious already. 

296
00:12:23,941 --> 00:12:26,541
We've passed Venice and are here in Bologna. 

297
00:12:26,541 --> 00:12:27,941
We'll eat it all. 

298
00:12:28,241 --> 00:12:29,808
Banana is also acidic, 

299
00:12:29,808 --> 00:12:30,974
so if you make it well, it's refreshing. 

300
00:12:30,974 --> 00:12:33,541
"Casa" means house and "della" is like "of." 

301
00:12:33,541 --> 00:12:36,174
There are over 350 types of grapes in Italy. 

302
00:12:36,174 --> 00:12:37,674
The background knowledge makes the food 

303
00:12:37,674 --> 00:12:39,908
taste better. 

304
00:12:39,908 --> 00:12:41,074
Okay? 

305
00:12:41,074 --> 00:12:42,308
I'm Joonwoo. 

306
00:12:42,308 --> 00:12:44,174
(Withering as he says his greeting) 

307
00:12:45,308 --> 00:12:46,674
"Withered?" 

308
00:12:47,708 --> 00:12:48,941
His shyness is his charm. 

309
00:12:49,674 --> 00:12:51,308
I'm doing my best. 

310
00:12:51,308 --> 00:12:52,874
I'll work even harder. 

311
00:12:54,941 --> 00:12:56,041
What was that? 

312
00:12:56,041 --> 00:12:58,541
(Shyness is the most popular personality trait) 

313
00:12:59,808 --> 00:13:02,574
- I want to eat so much. / - I want to eat it all. 

314
00:13:02,574 --> 00:13:03,741
He's so cute. 

315
00:13:03,741 --> 00:13:04,141
Oh, my. 

316
00:13:04,141 --> 00:13:06,574
- So cute. / - He's pretty cute. 

317
00:13:07,474 --> 00:13:08,841
Although I'm not a chef... 

318
00:13:08,841 --> 00:13:10,074
It's perfectly moist. 

319
00:13:10,074 --> 00:13:11,608
It's like they just put starch over them... 

320
00:13:11,608 --> 00:13:13,374
I'm actually a little nervous right now. 

321
00:13:13,374 --> 00:13:14,508
I like this one. 

322
00:13:14,508 --> 00:13:16,274
Sikyung, you look thin there. 

323
00:13:17,941 --> 00:13:19,274
You gained weight. 

324
00:13:19,274 --> 00:13:20,541
(This is the side effect of gourmet trips) 

325
00:13:22,208 --> 00:13:25,508
(Delicious food can melt him down) 

326
00:13:25,508 --> 00:13:27,908
This is the face he makes when it's really delicious. 

327
00:13:28,308 --> 00:13:29,774
He makes this face when it's really delicious. 

328
00:13:31,774 --> 00:13:34,074
(Sung Sikyung, the gourmet celebrity) 

329
00:13:34,541 --> 00:13:36,841
Italy is love. 

330
00:13:37,708 --> 00:13:40,341
- This is so good. / - He just added 5 slices. 

331
00:13:40,341 --> 00:13:43,841
Like sprinkling vinegar in cold noodles. 

332
00:13:43,841 --> 00:13:46,874
The taste of the Mediterranean is olive oil. 

333
00:13:46,874 --> 00:13:48,141
Is that olive oil? 

334
00:13:49,641 --> 00:13:51,341
Sourness, bitterness and sweetness. 

335
00:13:51,341 --> 00:13:53,674
It all comes together. May I lick the plate? 

336
00:13:53,841 --> 00:13:55,674
I'm really done. 

337
00:13:55,974 --> 00:13:57,174
Amazing. 

338
00:13:57,508 --> 00:14:00,708
(We Will Eat gourmet tour in Italy, coming soon!) 

339
00:14:01,208 --> 00:14:02,608
(Joonwoo's restaurant, 15 days before takeoff) 

340
00:14:02,608 --> 00:14:04,041
You have a very big restaurant. 

341
00:14:05,508 --> 00:14:07,174
- He's not an entertainer. / - Right. 

342
00:14:07,541 --> 00:14:09,141
So some people might not know him 

343
00:14:09,141 --> 00:14:11,041
but his lemon tart is 

344
00:14:11,041 --> 00:14:13,074
the best lemon tart I have ever had. 

345
00:14:13,074 --> 00:14:14,841
He does make very good lemon tarts. 

346
00:14:14,841 --> 00:14:16,208
- Thank you. / - His lemon tarts. 

347
00:14:16,208 --> 00:14:18,474
- Thank you. / - Anyway, he's a writer... 

348
00:14:18,974 --> 00:14:21,174
So he has a deep knowledge of... 

349
00:14:21,174 --> 00:14:23,108
Food and wine. 

350
00:14:23,108 --> 00:14:25,241
I cook Western food and I'm a writer. 

351
00:14:25,241 --> 00:14:26,308
I'm Park Joonwoo. 

352
00:14:26,308 --> 00:14:28,341
(Chef Park Joonwoo) 

353
00:14:28,341 --> 00:14:29,674
(Did I say it correctly?) 

354
00:14:29,674 --> 00:14:30,774
Yes. 

355
00:14:31,374 --> 00:14:32,908
My biggest worry is... 

356
00:14:33,474 --> 00:14:35,908
That he doesn't eat much and he's not funny either. 

357
00:14:36,241 --> 00:14:37,541
He can't even drink a lot. 

358
00:14:38,608 --> 00:14:40,174
Wonil is a big eater. 

359
00:14:40,174 --> 00:14:41,908
He can eat almost as much as Jeong Junha. 

360
00:14:42,474 --> 00:14:44,208
(He's a glutton) 

361
00:14:44,208 --> 00:14:45,574
He does eat a lot. 

362
00:14:45,574 --> 00:14:48,108
As far as I know, when it comes to food, 

363
00:14:48,108 --> 00:14:50,141
France and Italy are the countries that come to mind. 

364
00:14:50,141 --> 00:14:52,041
So which city in Italy are we going? 

365
00:14:52,041 --> 00:14:54,941
It hasn't been long since Italy was unified. 

366
00:14:54,941 --> 00:14:56,274
He'll talk about history a lot. 

367
00:14:57,274 --> 00:14:58,774
Because of this unique history, 

368
00:14:58,774 --> 00:15:01,074
the regional traits are more visibly different 

369
00:15:01,074 --> 00:15:03,274
than those of east and west regions in Korea. 

370
00:15:03,274 --> 00:15:04,508
We must choose a city. 

371
00:15:04,508 --> 00:15:05,674
(Which part of Italy will be a good choice?) 

372
00:15:05,674 --> 00:15:08,941
Actually, Toy, Yu Huiyeol... 

373
00:15:10,041 --> 00:15:11,408
Which album was it? 

374
00:15:11,408 --> 00:15:14,508
He went to Italy and was lying down on a gondola. 

375
00:15:14,508 --> 00:15:18,041
Just like that. The album was called "Fermata." 

376
00:15:18,041 --> 00:15:20,074
Does it mean a break? It means a pause. 

377
00:15:20,074 --> 00:15:21,841
- I see. Time to regroup. / - At times... 

378
00:15:21,841 --> 00:15:24,674
- I did want to visit Venice. / - Okay. 

379
00:15:24,674 --> 00:15:28,808
Venice is one of the cities people must visit in Italy. 

380
00:15:28,808 --> 00:15:30,941
I went 10 or so years ago on a trip. 

381
00:15:30,941 --> 00:15:31,974
- You've been there? / - Yes. 

382
00:15:31,974 --> 00:15:33,708
- Yes, I have. / - Venice sounds nice. 

383
00:15:33,708 --> 00:15:35,008
What about food in Venice? 

384
00:15:35,008 --> 00:15:36,008
Do they eat a lot of seafood? 

385
00:15:36,008 --> 00:15:38,974
Since they're on the water, they do eat seafood a lot. 

386
00:15:39,708 --> 00:15:40,641
My mouth is watering already. 

387
00:15:40,641 --> 00:15:41,741
Don't you love seafood? 

388
00:15:42,174 --> 00:15:44,774
- I cannot leave out seafood. / - Right. 

389
00:15:45,141 --> 00:15:46,708
- You love every kind of food. / - Yes. 

390
00:15:46,708 --> 00:15:48,308
I must love all the food equally. 

391
00:15:48,308 --> 00:15:52,608
Venice is a city that belongs to the Veneto region. 

392
00:15:52,608 --> 00:15:54,974
- Veneto is famous for white wine. / - Wine? 

393
00:15:54,974 --> 00:15:57,308
- It's near Venice. / - We'll go to Venice. 

394
00:15:57,308 --> 00:15:59,308
- White wine and seafood. / - For white wine. 

395
00:15:59,674 --> 00:16:01,274
- We can enjoy this combination. / - That's the best. 

396
00:16:01,674 --> 00:16:04,108
Seafood and white wine make the perfect pair. 

397
00:16:04,774 --> 00:16:05,908
Wine. Seriously. 

398
00:16:06,308 --> 00:16:08,008
How about going to Bologna? 

399
00:16:08,008 --> 00:16:09,241
- It's not too far? / - This sounds a bit random, right? 

400
00:16:09,241 --> 00:16:11,741
But when people discuss food in Italy, 

401
00:16:11,741 --> 00:16:13,374
it's one of the cities known for its cuisine. 

402
00:16:13,374 --> 00:16:15,008
A sauce is named after the city. 

403
00:16:15,008 --> 00:16:18,341
Bolognese sauce is the origin of meat sauce. 

404
00:16:18,341 --> 00:16:20,374
I am curious how the original would taste. 

405
00:16:20,374 --> 00:16:23,708
Actually, I've never had that in Bologna. 

406
00:16:23,708 --> 00:16:25,341
This is too extravagant. 

407
00:16:25,341 --> 00:16:27,308
Kimchi from abroad may be good... 

408
00:16:27,808 --> 00:16:29,541
But it can't beat the one in Korea. Don't you think? 

409
00:16:29,541 --> 00:16:32,241
- Of course. / - Great. We'll go to Venice... 

410
00:16:32,241 --> 00:16:33,974
- And Bologna. / - Okay. 

411
00:16:33,974 --> 00:16:36,708
You must know a lot about Europe. 

412
00:16:36,708 --> 00:16:37,541
Please look up great restaurants. 

413
00:16:37,541 --> 00:16:40,008
I'll prepare activities we can try there. 

414
00:16:40,008 --> 00:16:41,074
Will we ride the gondola? 

415
00:16:41,708 --> 00:16:42,974
- We must do obvious activities too. / - Of course. 

416
00:16:42,974 --> 00:16:44,274
- Since we're all the way in Italy. / - We're on a trip. 

417
00:16:44,274 --> 00:16:45,341
We must take photos there. 

418
00:16:45,341 --> 00:16:48,241
- You must ride a gondola in Venice. / - We must. 

419
00:16:48,241 --> 00:16:51,641
Italy is famous for this one other than prosciutto. 

420
00:16:51,641 --> 00:16:53,574
Can you read this? Mortadella. 

421
00:16:53,574 --> 00:16:56,241
It's very soft and delicious. 

422
00:16:56,241 --> 00:16:59,141
That's the best. Hands down, mortadella's the best. 

423
00:16:59,141 --> 00:17:00,108
Is that ham? 

424
00:17:00,108 --> 00:17:02,174
I want to wash my face with that. I mean it. 

425
00:17:03,008 --> 00:17:05,541
I'm telling you. It's the best. It's soft. 

426
00:17:06,941 --> 00:17:08,108
(That sounds delicious) 

427
00:17:08,774 --> 00:17:11,008
Squid ink pasta, gelato and pizza. 

428
00:17:11,008 --> 00:17:13,341
We must drink coffee when we get up in the morning. 

429
00:17:18,308 --> 00:17:19,774
(He shows his cell phone without speaking a word) 

430
00:17:21,108 --> 00:17:23,141
Venice is beautiful. 

431
00:17:23,141 --> 00:17:25,041
It looks like the Rialto Bridge is really famous. 

432
00:17:25,041 --> 00:17:27,108
(He's planning the itinerary for the sightseeing part) 

433
00:17:27,108 --> 00:17:28,908
Doesn't this look European? 

434
00:17:30,374 --> 00:17:32,541
Great, this would be a great place to go. 

435
00:17:32,541 --> 00:17:33,574
We'll go... 

436
00:17:34,608 --> 00:17:35,574
And destroy it. 

437
00:17:35,574 --> 00:17:38,908
I'll show you how quickly a man can gain weight. 

438
00:17:39,741 --> 00:17:43,074
(Italy Gourmet Tour) 

439
00:17:43,074 --> 00:17:44,508
My gosh, I already feel full. 

440
00:17:44,508 --> 00:17:45,541
One pizza per person? 

441
00:17:45,541 --> 00:17:46,474
You have to have one each. 

442
00:17:46,474 --> 00:17:48,241
In Italy, it's always one pizza per person. 

443
00:17:48,241 --> 00:17:50,041
That's right. 

444
00:17:53,941 --> 00:17:56,308
Have you been well? Our luggage looks similar. 

445
00:17:56,674 --> 00:17:58,808
- Hello. / - Hi. 

446
00:17:58,808 --> 00:17:59,874
(The start of a trip is always exciting) 

447
00:17:59,874 --> 00:18:01,608
Direct flights to Venice are available now. 

448
00:18:02,141 --> 00:18:04,174
You can go to your gate by 9:45 a.m. 

449
00:18:04,174 --> 00:18:05,474
- Okay. / - Have a good day. 

450
00:18:05,474 --> 00:18:06,774
- Bye. / - Bye. 

451
00:18:06,774 --> 00:18:08,908
There are direct flights to Venice. 

452
00:18:09,308 --> 00:18:11,008
- Wait, there are direct flights? / - I was so surprised. 

453
00:18:11,008 --> 00:18:12,708
- They just opened a new route. / - I was surprised. 

454
00:18:12,708 --> 00:18:15,208
- This is great, seriously. / - It's awesome. 

455
00:18:15,208 --> 00:18:16,241
Come on. 

456
00:18:16,941 --> 00:18:22,074
(The city of water consists of waterways) 

457
00:18:23,108 --> 00:18:27,374
(This lively and peaceful city presents elegant beauty) 

458
00:18:28,408 --> 00:18:33,341
(The one and only city of water in the world, Venice) 

459
00:18:33,341 --> 00:18:35,608
Actually, Venice is a city of dreams. 

460
00:18:37,174 --> 00:18:39,641
- This is amazing. / - Gosh, Venice. 

461
00:18:39,641 --> 00:18:41,441
"Beautiful Venice." Did I get that right? 

462
00:18:41,441 --> 00:18:42,441
I don't know. 

463
00:18:43,274 --> 00:18:47,008
Anyway, this is the typical look of Venice, right? 

464
00:18:47,008 --> 00:18:48,741
We just came out of the airport. 

465
00:18:48,741 --> 00:18:50,041
- My gosh. / - Do people get on that? 

466
00:18:50,041 --> 00:18:51,074
What's that? 

467
00:18:52,041 --> 00:18:54,174
(Impressed) 

468
00:18:54,174 --> 00:18:55,341
Gosh, that's so interesting. 

469
00:18:55,341 --> 00:18:57,441
That's the front of the airport. 

470
00:18:57,441 --> 00:19:01,974
(The exotic scenery greets them from the start) 

471
00:19:03,874 --> 00:19:08,074
(Ocean view right out of the airport) 

472
00:19:08,941 --> 00:19:11,274
- Gosh. / - This is so cool. 

473
00:19:11,274 --> 00:19:13,008
This is my first time in Italy. 

474
00:19:13,008 --> 00:19:14,941
- This is your first time in Italy? / - Yes. 

475
00:19:14,941 --> 00:19:17,341
This is my third trip to Italy. I haven't been here much. 

476
00:19:17,574 --> 00:19:19,408
But I came to Venice 14 years ago. 

477
00:19:19,408 --> 00:19:20,541
This is my first time. 

478
00:19:20,541 --> 00:19:22,574
I'm not sure if we'll be able to communicate. 

479
00:19:22,574 --> 00:19:23,574
That's why I feel a bit anxious. 

480
00:19:23,574 --> 00:19:25,774
- It's a tourist destination though. / - English? 

481
00:19:25,774 --> 00:19:27,808
Wouldn't they speak English? 

482
00:19:28,408 --> 00:19:30,108
We can get there via bus 

483
00:19:30,108 --> 00:19:31,708
but we'll get there by water taxi. 

484
00:19:32,474 --> 00:19:33,974
- All the way to our lodging. / - Gosh, that looks nice. 

485
00:19:33,974 --> 00:19:35,508
Isn't water taxi expensive here? 

486
00:19:35,508 --> 00:19:39,141
If we take the bus, we'll have to climb up the stairs. 

487
00:19:39,141 --> 00:19:42,241
If we take the boat, it'll take us 5 minutes on foot. 

488
00:19:43,274 --> 00:19:43,941
Because there are a lot of waterways? 

489
00:19:43,941 --> 00:19:45,541
It won't be in front of the hotel. 

490
00:19:45,541 --> 00:19:47,808
- But there are waterways. / - That's convenient. 

491
00:19:47,808 --> 00:19:49,741
It'd be weird if we take the bus in Venice. 

492
00:19:49,741 --> 00:19:51,108
- Yes, it's a city of water. / - Right. 

493
00:19:51,108 --> 00:19:52,874
We don't have to get there by land. 

494
00:19:52,874 --> 00:19:54,941
- Let's go grab a taxi. / - Okay. 

495
00:19:54,941 --> 00:19:56,841
(They set out to get on the water taxi) 

496
00:19:57,308 --> 00:20:00,074
- Thank you. / - Even the boat was so luxurious. 

497
00:20:00,074 --> 00:20:02,241
(The water taxi cuts through the ocean) 

498
00:20:02,241 --> 00:20:05,441
- That looks so cool. / - We haven't seen this before. 

499
00:20:05,974 --> 00:20:07,908
There's the ocean right outside the airport. 

500
00:20:07,908 --> 00:20:10,241
You don't need anything else, just a water taxi. 

501
00:20:10,241 --> 00:20:11,941
You're right. This is so nice. 

502
00:20:14,641 --> 00:20:15,674
This is awesome. 

503
00:20:15,674 --> 00:20:17,308
(They admire the unobstructed view) 

504
00:20:17,308 --> 00:20:18,308
This is outstanding. 

505
00:20:18,774 --> 00:20:20,708
- Seriously? / - What is it? 

506
00:20:20,708 --> 00:20:23,508
I shouldn't be on this taxi with a bearded man. 

507
00:20:24,508 --> 00:20:26,608
(Gosh) 

508
00:20:27,308 --> 00:20:28,541
Why not? This is nice. 

509
00:20:28,541 --> 00:20:30,074
(Into the city of water through the vast ocean) 

510
00:20:30,074 --> 00:20:31,808
The view ahead of us is amazing. 

511
00:20:33,008 --> 00:20:34,774
We're going into the town right away. 

512
00:20:34,774 --> 00:20:37,608
Is he going to drop you off at your hotel just like that? 

513
00:20:37,608 --> 00:20:39,741
- 5 minutes after we get off. / - No way. Unbelievable. 

514
00:20:40,408 --> 00:20:42,941
- This is amazing. / - How can he go into the alleys? 

515
00:20:45,374 --> 00:20:47,908
- This is indeed a city of water. / - It's awesome. 

516
00:20:48,741 --> 00:20:50,074
Things look so interesting here. 

517
00:20:50,474 --> 00:20:52,641
We can still get to our destination... 

518
00:20:52,641 --> 00:20:55,108
- Without setting foot on the road. / - Right. 

519
00:20:55,108 --> 00:20:57,641
(They take in the scenery of Venice) 

520
00:20:57,641 --> 00:20:59,474
This place is incredible. 

521
00:21:00,241 --> 00:21:01,841
Everyone, you should come here. 

522
00:21:01,841 --> 00:21:04,874
This water taxi ride makes the trip worth it. 

523
00:21:04,874 --> 00:21:06,408
We get to look around the alleys on the boat. 

524
00:21:06,408 --> 00:21:07,674
This is indeed awesome. 

525
00:21:09,141 --> 00:21:11,374
My gosh, I sound like a country boy. I love it. 

526
00:21:11,374 --> 00:21:13,041
What can we do? We love it here. 

527
00:21:13,041 --> 00:21:14,874
- I was really excited then. / - Yes. 

528
00:21:14,874 --> 00:21:16,374
See? That's how it looks there. 

529
00:21:16,974 --> 00:21:19,408
It's really beautiful. It's so pretty. 

530
00:21:19,408 --> 00:21:21,274
This is a movie. It's a scene from a movie. 

531
00:21:22,008 --> 00:21:25,374
(They pass by a small water alley) 

532
00:21:25,374 --> 00:21:27,174
- Incredible. / - My goodness, hold on. 

533
00:21:27,174 --> 00:21:29,308
We got out of the alley and on the main street now. 

534
00:21:30,474 --> 00:21:31,508
Amazing. 

535
00:21:32,041 --> 00:21:34,408
This town is so strange. 

536
00:21:34,408 --> 00:21:36,608
Isn't that the water bus? It's the water bus. 

537
00:21:36,608 --> 00:21:37,708
This is the water bus. 

538
00:21:37,708 --> 00:21:40,141
- I only took that when I came. / - Why? 

539
00:21:40,141 --> 00:21:44,041
It was just a bus but it was fun to glide on the water. 

540
00:21:44,041 --> 00:21:45,141
It was nice and breezy. 

541
00:21:46,008 --> 00:21:47,041
Gondola. 

542
00:21:47,041 --> 00:21:48,708
(Hello, I'm a gondola) 

543
00:21:48,708 --> 00:21:51,341
It's so romantic. They're on a date. 

544
00:21:51,341 --> 00:21:52,374
Look at that. 

545
00:21:53,641 --> 00:21:55,808
That one is equivalent to a limousine. 

546
00:21:56,341 --> 00:21:57,341
Ours is like Uber. 

547
00:21:57,341 --> 00:21:58,341
(This is just a taxi, that's a limousine) 

548
00:21:58,341 --> 00:22:00,341
This is so intriguing. They get around on that. 

549
00:22:01,441 --> 00:22:03,041
I'm such a tourist. 

550
00:22:03,041 --> 00:22:04,041
(Venice makes even Sikyung take photos) 

551
00:22:04,041 --> 00:22:06,008
- He rarely takes photos. / - Right? 

552
00:22:06,474 --> 00:22:07,641
I took those photos. 

553
00:22:07,641 --> 00:22:09,708
(Arrived in Venice, expert photographer) 

554
00:22:10,008 --> 00:22:11,074
That's incredible. 

555
00:22:11,808 --> 00:22:13,641
It wasn't that I did a good job at taking photos. 

556
00:22:13,641 --> 00:22:15,241
In Venice, photos just turn out well. 

557
00:22:15,241 --> 00:22:16,241
(The scenery is picturesque) 

558
00:22:16,241 --> 00:22:17,241
That's why people go there. 

559
00:22:17,241 --> 00:22:18,174
He almost never takes photos. 

560
00:22:18,174 --> 00:22:19,974
It must be really beautiful there. 

561
00:22:19,974 --> 00:22:23,141
We have to brace ourselves today. 

562
00:22:23,141 --> 00:22:25,308
Let's rest up and have all of our energy tomorrow. 

563
00:22:25,308 --> 00:22:27,108
We must destroy Lee Wonil. 

564
00:22:27,108 --> 00:22:28,841
- That's your agenda? / - Of course. 

565
00:22:29,141 --> 00:22:30,874
We'll happily get some rest today. 

566
00:22:30,874 --> 00:22:34,508
(They will look around Venice the next day) 

567
00:22:42,808 --> 00:22:43,974
It was so beautiful. 

568
00:22:47,208 --> 00:22:52,241
(A relaxing morning of Venice dawns again) 

569
00:22:56,808 --> 00:22:59,374
- It's the morning of Venice. / - Venice. 

570
00:22:59,374 --> 00:23:00,641
What time did you wake up? 

571
00:23:00,641 --> 00:23:03,608
- Around 4:30 a.m. / - I woke at 5 a.m. 

572
00:23:03,608 --> 00:23:04,908
I went to the Rialto Bridge. 

573
00:23:04,908 --> 00:23:07,141
- Really? / - I'm a tourist. I'm serious. 

574
00:23:07,141 --> 00:23:08,241
Did you like it? How was it? 

575
00:23:08,241 --> 00:23:10,374
It was a nice to walk on while listening to music. 

576
00:23:10,374 --> 00:23:13,074
A morning stroll in Venice sounds pretty romantic. 

577
00:23:13,074 --> 00:23:15,641
I heard this a lot about Italians from Alberto. 

578
00:23:15,641 --> 00:23:17,741
They eat croissants and espresso for breakfast. 

579
00:23:17,741 --> 00:23:18,741
That's right. 

580
00:23:18,741 --> 00:23:21,341
Everything is beautiful and every dish is delicious. 

581
00:23:21,341 --> 00:23:25,541
I found this bar that the locals especially love. 

582
00:23:25,541 --> 00:23:27,841
That's where they have their breakfast. 

583
00:23:27,841 --> 00:23:29,374
(Bar, restaurants that only sell beverages and snacks) 

584
00:23:29,374 --> 00:23:31,974
In Korea, bars are strictly for drinking. 

585
00:23:31,974 --> 00:23:34,474
People call places where you drink coffee, bars. 

586
00:23:34,474 --> 00:23:35,374
- Coffee and snacks. / - Yes. 

587
00:23:35,374 --> 00:23:36,874
(Slurping it in one go is the key) 

588
00:23:37,241 --> 00:23:39,108
That's the bar. This part is a bit... 

589
00:23:39,108 --> 00:23:40,141
I don't even see a sign here. 

590
00:23:40,141 --> 00:23:43,041
Exactly. I heard that locals here frequent this bar. 

591
00:23:43,041 --> 00:23:44,708
That's why we're trying this place out. 

592
00:23:44,708 --> 00:23:45,941
(Italy Gourmet Tour) 

593
00:23:45,941 --> 00:23:47,541
(Italian brunch) 

594
00:23:47,541 --> 00:23:48,741
Gosh, Italian brunch. 

595
00:23:48,741 --> 00:23:51,108
- Look at the bread. / - I'm suddenly getting hungry. 

596
00:23:51,108 --> 00:23:53,408
- Good morning. / - Good morning. 

597
00:23:53,941 --> 00:23:56,008
They sell this with coffee. 

598
00:23:56,474 --> 00:23:58,174
- Brioche? / - Brioche. 

599
00:23:58,174 --> 00:24:00,674
- A brioche? Not a croissant? / - What's interesting is... 

600
00:24:00,674 --> 00:24:02,208
The brioche we know looks different. 

601
00:24:02,208 --> 00:24:04,874
Right. It's the fermented, round ball of bread. 

602
00:24:04,874 --> 00:24:08,541
In Italy, people call croissants brioches. 

603
00:24:08,541 --> 00:24:11,741
The wrong term spread but it stuck. 

604
00:24:12,174 --> 00:24:14,574
- So brioches are croissants? / - That's right. 

605
00:24:14,574 --> 00:24:15,641
(In Italy, they mean the same) 

606
00:24:15,641 --> 00:24:18,941
When you order, you can use both terms, 

607
00:24:18,941 --> 00:24:20,174
brioche and croissant. 

608
00:24:20,174 --> 00:24:20,608
Okay. 

609
00:24:21,641 --> 00:24:24,274
- Marmalade. Cream. / - This one has marmalade. 

610
00:24:24,274 --> 00:24:25,641
Should we try all of them? 

611
00:24:25,641 --> 00:24:27,541
- Yes, we'll have three. / - Let's try them all.

- Three? Okay. / - And espresso.

00:24:29,441 --> 00:24:30,508
One espresso. 

614
00:24:30,874 --> 00:24:32,274
Espresso and cappuccino. 

615
00:24:32,274 --> 00:24:33,108
One cappuccino. 

616
00:24:33,108 --> 00:24:36,508
- Cappuccino? / - They drink this for breakfast. 

617
00:24:36,508 --> 00:24:38,108
(How did he know that?) 

618
00:24:39,041 --> 00:24:41,074
Italy is known for its espresso. 

619
00:24:41,074 --> 00:24:43,041
- Their coffee is truly amazing. / - Right. 

620
00:24:43,974 --> 00:24:45,008
It smells savory. 

621
00:24:45,774 --> 00:24:47,774
Gosh, cappuccino. 

622
00:24:48,574 --> 00:24:52,408
(Toasted brioches are served along with their coffee) 

623
00:24:52,408 --> 00:24:54,208
- Wonil's falling for it. / - Yes. 

624
00:24:54,208 --> 00:24:55,941
- You're falling for it. / - Yes. 

625
00:24:55,941 --> 00:24:57,808
I was biting my nails without realizing it.

(Italian brunch) 

627
00:25:00,808 --> 00:25:02,708
That's only 1.2 euros. 

628
00:25:02,708 --> 00:25:04,974
- Yes, it's so cheap. / - How much is that? 

629
00:25:04,974 --> 00:25:06,974
- About $1.40. / - About $1.50. 

630
00:25:07,708 --> 00:25:08,908
That's really cheap. 

631
00:25:10,141 --> 00:25:12,674
(Espresso $1.20, cappuccino $2) 

632
00:25:13,574 --> 00:25:17,008
(They grab a seat outside the bar) 

633
00:25:17,008 --> 00:25:18,408
Let's drink the coffee. 

634
00:25:19,074 --> 00:25:21,841
(What does Italian coffee taste like?) 

635
00:25:23,074 --> 00:25:25,374
- It's delicious. / - Gosh. 

636
00:25:25,374 --> 00:25:26,741
It's different. 

637
00:25:27,574 --> 00:25:29,408
- Well... / - How can coffee be so delicious? 

638
00:25:29,741 --> 00:25:31,508
It's addictive. 

639
00:25:31,508 --> 00:25:33,374
Italians in Korea... 

640
00:25:33,374 --> 00:25:34,708
- Miss this so much. / - Italian coffee. 

641
00:25:34,708 --> 00:25:36,274
- This is a necessity. / - I see. 

642
00:25:36,608 --> 00:25:37,874
A shot in the morning. 

643
00:25:37,874 --> 00:25:39,441
A shot during the day. 

644
00:25:39,774 --> 00:25:41,274
They need them 

645
00:25:41,274 --> 00:25:42,541
but they can't have them in Korea. 

646
00:25:42,541 --> 00:25:45,608
Actually, I drink iced Americano in the morning. 

647
00:25:46,308 --> 00:25:48,941
Because the cold coffee wakes me up. 

648
00:25:48,941 --> 00:25:52,941
But in Italy, they never put ice in coffee. 

649
00:25:55,708 --> 00:25:57,374
(Shall we try the pastry?) 

650
00:25:57,374 --> 00:25:59,441
They cut it and filled it. 

651
00:25:59,441 --> 00:26:02,074
(Brioche filled with custard cream) 

652
00:26:02,074 --> 00:26:03,941
- Gosh, that looks good. / - Goodness. 

653
00:26:03,941 --> 00:26:05,408
What's that? 

654
00:26:06,141 --> 00:26:08,608
What is that cream? 

655
00:26:08,608 --> 00:26:11,041
- That looks good. / - It looks delicious. 

656
00:26:11,041 --> 00:26:13,074
- It has vanilla cream. / - That's crazy. 

657
00:26:13,074 --> 00:26:14,641
You drink the bitter espresso 

658
00:26:14,641 --> 00:26:15,841
and then eat the sweet pastry. 

659
00:26:15,841 --> 00:26:17,608
You keep going back and forth. 

660
00:26:17,608 --> 00:26:19,541
You'd eat endlessly. 

661
00:26:19,541 --> 00:26:21,841
(Taking a big bite) 

662
00:26:21,841 --> 00:26:23,108
- How is it? / - It's good. 

663
00:26:24,308 --> 00:26:25,708
It's soft. 

664
00:26:25,708 --> 00:26:27,041
It has filling. 

665
00:26:28,274 --> 00:26:29,441
It's apricot jam. 

666
00:26:29,441 --> 00:26:30,708
Yes. It's good. 

667
00:26:31,874 --> 00:26:33,541
Apricot jam? 

668
00:26:34,408 --> 00:26:35,874
Wonil is nervous. 

669
00:26:36,574 --> 00:26:38,108
Don't do that. 

670
00:26:38,508 --> 00:26:41,308
Cup noodles are going down. 

671
00:26:41,308 --> 00:26:42,441
(Brioche takes no. 1) 

672
00:26:42,441 --> 00:26:43,874
I should have brioche. 

673
00:26:45,641 --> 00:26:47,808
- That's so good. / - I don't know much about bread. 

674
00:26:47,808 --> 00:26:49,008
Coffee is good too. 

675
00:26:49,508 --> 00:26:54,074
Bread and cappuccino have milk in them. 

676
00:26:54,074 --> 00:26:56,441
Each country's milk product tastes different. 

677
00:26:56,441 --> 00:26:58,141
Because the cows are different. 

678
00:26:59,008 --> 00:27:01,374
Italy has good pasturage. 

679
00:27:02,341 --> 00:27:03,908
So stock and chicken farming thrive. 

680
00:27:04,574 --> 00:27:05,874
Milk products are delicious too. 

681
00:27:05,874 --> 00:27:07,308
As you can see, 

682
00:27:07,308 --> 00:27:09,241
the bread is very white. 

683
00:27:09,241 --> 00:27:11,174
Because they put less butter. 

684
00:27:11,174 --> 00:27:12,641
- Butter makes it more yellow? / - Yes. 

685
00:27:12,641 --> 00:27:14,341
So it seems that they like to fill it 

686
00:27:14,341 --> 00:27:16,708
with jam or chocolate better. 

687
00:27:16,708 --> 00:27:18,908
- Right. / - Italian croissant is... 

688
00:27:18,908 --> 00:27:20,641
Different from French croissant. 

689
00:27:20,641 --> 00:27:21,974
It's just like bread. 

690
00:27:21,974 --> 00:27:23,574
This isn't heavy for breakfast. 

691
00:27:23,574 --> 00:27:25,441
So this filling goes well with it. 

692
00:27:25,741 --> 00:27:28,941
Rich French croissant with chocolate filling... 

693
00:27:29,541 --> 00:27:31,741
- Will be too much. / - It will be. 

694
00:27:31,741 --> 00:27:33,341
I finished my coffee too fast. 

695
00:27:33,341 --> 00:27:34,841
(Empty) 

696
00:27:34,841 --> 00:27:36,441
I basically downed it. 

697
00:27:36,441 --> 00:27:38,008
I'm using spoon to scrape coffee. 

698
00:27:38,374 --> 00:27:41,941
That milk foam on top of the espresso is so soft. 

699
00:27:41,941 --> 00:27:45,008
I ate it with the bread and it was so delicious. 

700
00:27:45,008 --> 00:27:47,941
It's so different from the franchised coffee we drink. 

701
00:27:49,174 --> 00:27:50,874
Order a triple shot or something. 

702
00:27:50,874 --> 00:27:52,508
It won't be enough. 

703
00:27:52,508 --> 00:27:53,908
But be careful. 

704
00:27:53,908 --> 00:27:55,774
If you drink 4 or 5 espressos, 

705
00:27:55,774 --> 00:27:58,508
you'll become too hyper. 

706
00:27:58,508 --> 00:27:59,508
But... 

707
00:27:59,941 --> 00:28:01,774
Sitting here like this... 

708
00:28:01,774 --> 00:28:04,608
"It's so nice to be here with you, honey." 

709
00:28:04,608 --> 00:28:06,074
It should be like this, for example. 

710
00:28:06,074 --> 00:28:07,108
(Laughing) 

711
00:28:07,374 --> 00:28:10,441
- I'm sorry that I'm a man. / - I mean, no. 

712
00:28:10,441 --> 00:28:12,174
I didn't say it to make you feel sorry. 

713
00:28:12,174 --> 00:28:14,408
- But that's what you meant. / - If you're having... 

714
00:28:14,408 --> 00:28:15,941
Coffee and bread here with someone... 

715
00:28:16,241 --> 00:28:19,074
You'll just feel special. 

716
00:28:19,074 --> 00:28:21,474
This is really romantic. 

717
00:28:21,474 --> 00:28:22,841
The weather was perfect. 

718
00:28:22,841 --> 00:28:24,474
I was happy just sitting there. 

719
00:28:28,108 --> 00:28:30,608
I want to have cream brioche. 

720
00:28:30,941 --> 00:28:32,574
This is a gourmet trip. 

721
00:28:32,574 --> 00:28:35,108
So we're going to do a gourmet assessment. 

722
00:28:35,108 --> 00:28:38,341
This will be a very personal assessment. 

723
00:28:38,741 --> 00:28:41,308
We can tell the viewers whether they should visit. 

724
00:28:41,641 --> 00:28:44,574
- The location is great. / - It's the best. 

725
00:28:44,574 --> 00:28:45,874
The price is the best. 

726
00:28:46,574 --> 00:28:48,408
Coffee and bread go perfect together. 

727
00:28:49,941 --> 00:28:51,541
Espresso first. 

728
00:28:51,541 --> 00:28:52,708
- Espresso. / - It must be good. 

729
00:28:52,708 --> 00:28:54,041
How many stars? 

730
00:28:54,541 --> 00:28:56,341
Italian espresso is the best. It wakes you up. 

731
00:28:56,341 --> 00:28:58,474
You can start the morning in Venice with coffee. 

732
00:28:58,474 --> 00:29:00,508
- Are you a writer? / - Yes. 

733
00:29:00,508 --> 00:29:02,441
- That was so good. / - Written by Sung Sikyung. 

734
00:29:04,041 --> 00:29:05,441
Wonderful coffee. Fantastic atmosphere. 

735
00:29:06,574 --> 00:29:08,674
There are so many bars like this. 

736
00:29:08,674 --> 00:29:10,908
It'll be nice to enjoy this if you visit Venice. 

737
00:29:10,908 --> 00:29:11,974
(4.5 stars for the Italian brunch) 

738
00:29:12,708 --> 00:29:14,974
Venice is famous for seafood. 

739
00:29:14,974 --> 00:29:17,008
We should really try... 

740
00:29:17,441 --> 00:29:18,708
Squid ink pasta. 

741
00:29:19,441 --> 00:29:21,708
In northern Italy, they normally eat fresh pasta. 

742
00:29:21,708 --> 00:29:24,608
So they use fresh pasta and squid ink sauce. 

743
00:29:24,608 --> 00:29:26,441
We should try that. 

744
00:29:26,441 --> 00:29:28,041
- Seriously. / - For drinks... 

745
00:29:28,441 --> 00:29:29,741
We need to drink wine. 

746
00:29:29,741 --> 00:29:30,941
That must be really delicious. 

747
00:29:30,941 --> 00:29:33,108
- White wine is famous there. / - White wine! 

748
00:29:33,108 --> 00:29:35,008
Squid ink pasta with white wine is amazing. 

749
00:29:35,008 --> 00:29:37,374
(Italy Gourmet Tour) 

750
00:29:37,374 --> 00:29:38,974
That looks pretty. 

751
00:29:38,974 --> 00:29:40,541
(Squid ink pasta restaurant) 

752
00:29:41,408 --> 00:29:44,608
(What will they do next in Venice?) 

753
00:29:44,608 --> 00:29:45,841
Here you have... 

754
00:29:46,508 --> 00:29:48,474
The first bridge built in Venice. 

755
00:29:48,474 --> 00:29:49,674
That's Rialto Bridge. 

756
00:29:49,674 --> 00:29:50,874
- That white bridge? / - Yes. 

757
00:29:50,874 --> 00:29:52,741
(Rialto Bridge was built in 1591) 

758
00:29:52,741 --> 00:29:53,874
It's big. 

759
00:29:54,274 --> 00:29:55,374
There are so many people. 

760
00:29:56,041 --> 00:29:58,908
It's much bigger than the bridges we saw. 

761
00:29:58,908 --> 00:30:00,074
It's the biggest. 

762
00:30:00,641 --> 00:30:02,308
Shouldn't we eat now? 

763
00:30:02,308 --> 00:30:04,741
Yes, we're going to. 

764
00:30:04,741 --> 00:30:08,508
Ristorante and tratto... 

765
00:30:08,508 --> 00:30:10,808
- Trattoria. / - What's the difference? 

766
00:30:11,174 --> 00:30:14,641
Ristorante is like a restaurant. 

767
00:30:14,641 --> 00:30:17,108
You can have a course meal. It's a formal restaurant. 

768
00:30:17,108 --> 00:30:18,708
I should write that down. 

769
00:30:18,708 --> 00:30:20,341
Below that is trattoria. 

770
00:30:20,341 --> 00:30:22,108
Pizzeria is where you can have pizza. 

771
00:30:22,108 --> 00:30:24,674
Bar is where we had breakfast. 

772
00:30:24,674 --> 00:30:27,808
You can have coffee and snacks like bread. 

773
00:30:27,808 --> 00:30:29,108
When you go to Italy, 

774
00:30:29,108 --> 00:30:31,341
depending on your budget, taste or situation, 

775
00:30:31,341 --> 00:30:33,274
you can choose where to go. 

776
00:30:36,041 --> 00:30:37,308
Somewhere delicious... 

777
00:30:37,308 --> 00:30:40,741
I chose this place because it had a good rating. 

778
00:30:40,741 --> 00:30:42,041
But... 

779
00:30:42,608 --> 00:30:44,908
They made it so that you have to be close. 

780
00:30:44,908 --> 00:30:46,308
- Like this. / - If you sit like this. 

781
00:30:46,308 --> 00:30:47,841
- Goodness. / - Gosh. 

782
00:30:48,241 --> 00:30:49,941
I hate that atmosphere. 

783
00:30:49,941 --> 00:30:51,808
(I wish I didn't see that) 

784
00:30:51,808 --> 00:30:53,474
You can't help but to be close. 

785
00:30:54,041 --> 00:30:55,274
If you sit like this. 

786
00:30:56,341 --> 00:31:02,841
(Love in Venice) 

787
00:31:02,841 --> 00:31:05,408
Like I said before, trattoria 

788
00:31:05,408 --> 00:31:08,974
is cozy and humble. 

789
00:31:09,574 --> 00:31:10,608
Hello. 

790
00:31:10,608 --> 00:31:11,874
(Making their first order in Venice) 

791
00:31:11,874 --> 00:31:13,008
Thank you. 

792
00:31:13,008 --> 00:31:14,908
- Here you go. / - Thank you. 

793
00:31:14,908 --> 00:31:17,908
People might find 

794
00:31:17,908 --> 00:31:21,008
the Italian menu difficult. 

795
00:31:21,008 --> 00:31:23,108
Antipasti is... 

796
00:31:23,108 --> 00:31:25,408
- Appetizer. / - It's a starter. 

797
00:31:25,408 --> 00:31:27,241
What's different in Italy is this. 

798
00:31:27,241 --> 00:31:28,874
They always have two main dishes. 

799
00:31:28,874 --> 00:31:29,608
2 mains? 

800
00:31:29,608 --> 00:31:31,008
First main dish is carbohydrate. 

801
00:31:31,008 --> 00:31:33,141
- Protein comes next? / - Second is protein. 

802
00:31:33,141 --> 00:31:34,208
That's interesting. 

803
00:31:34,208 --> 00:31:37,041
Next is dolce which is dessert. 

804
00:31:37,041 --> 00:31:38,974
We usually have meat first, then noodles. 

805
00:31:38,974 --> 00:31:40,274
But here, they have noodles first, then meat. 

806
00:31:40,708 --> 00:31:42,141
- Really? / - They do it the other way. 

807
00:31:42,141 --> 00:31:43,374
- First noodles, meat after. / - Okay. 

808
00:31:43,374 --> 00:31:45,374
- This is hard. / - What should we eat? 

809
00:31:45,374 --> 00:31:47,274
Antipasti... 

810
00:31:48,108 --> 00:31:49,974
It has a star next to this. 

811
00:31:50,508 --> 00:31:52,608
- This is recommended. / - Piovra. 

812
00:31:52,608 --> 00:31:53,941
- This is delicious. / - It looks good. 

813
00:31:53,941 --> 00:31:55,141
- Let's order this. / - Okay. 

814
00:31:55,141 --> 00:31:58,108
Venice is famous for squid ink pasta. 

815
00:31:58,108 --> 00:31:59,574
- Nero. / - Yes. 

816
00:31:59,574 --> 00:32:01,508
- I want to try it. / - Nero is black. 

817
00:32:01,508 --> 00:32:04,174
Seppie is cuttlefish. 

818
00:32:04,174 --> 00:32:05,708
So it's squid ink. 

819
00:32:05,708 --> 00:32:08,141
- Squid ink pasta. / - We'll order that. 

820
00:32:08,141 --> 00:32:10,374
We should order deep-fried seafood in Venice. 

821
00:32:10,808 --> 00:32:12,874
- This, no. 3. / - Yes, no. 3. 

822
00:32:12,874 --> 00:32:14,241
I'm drooling over wine. 

823
00:32:14,241 --> 00:32:15,674
(They haven't finished ordering yet) 

824
00:32:15,674 --> 00:32:16,841
Italy is about wine. 

825
00:32:17,208 --> 00:32:20,341
- First... / - White wine. 

826
00:32:20,341 --> 00:32:22,208
Rosso is red. 

827
00:32:22,208 --> 00:32:25,108
Biancho is white. 

828
00:32:25,108 --> 00:32:26,208
But it says bianchi. 

829
00:32:26,208 --> 00:32:27,708
That's plural. 

830
00:32:28,074 --> 00:32:30,274
With an "i," it's plural. Instead of "s." 

831
00:32:30,274 --> 00:32:33,041
- It's like white wines. / - That's right. 

832
00:32:33,441 --> 00:32:35,474
- They have this too. / - What? 

833
00:32:35,474 --> 00:32:37,541
Aperitifs. 

834
00:32:37,541 --> 00:32:38,541
Drink served before meals. 

835
00:32:38,541 --> 00:32:41,741
In Europe, they have a drink before drinking wine. 

836
00:32:42,308 --> 00:32:43,641
- Before a meal. / - Yes. 

837
00:32:43,641 --> 00:32:46,308
Sweet drinks have Aperol. 

838
00:32:46,608 --> 00:32:48,774
Bitter drinks have Campari. 

839
00:32:48,774 --> 00:32:50,341
- Different liquor then. / - Yes. 

840
00:32:50,341 --> 00:32:51,908
They mix different liquors. 

841
00:32:51,908 --> 00:32:53,374
You can choose. 

842
00:32:53,374 --> 00:32:54,808
Shall we have one each? 

843
00:32:54,808 --> 00:32:56,508
- Which one do you like? / - Bitter one. 

844
00:32:56,508 --> 00:32:58,674
- Then I'll order a sweet one. / - Okay. 

845
00:33:01,074 --> 00:33:02,541
This is it. 

846
00:33:02,541 --> 00:33:05,174
(This is it) 

847
00:33:06,208 --> 00:33:08,241
They add liquor in white wine. 

848
00:33:08,741 --> 00:33:11,408
- Over 20% alcohol. / - Adding strong liquor to wine. 

849
00:33:11,408 --> 00:33:13,608
It's like a cocktail. 

850
00:33:14,674 --> 00:33:17,608
(What does Venetian aperitif taste like?) 

851
00:33:20,041 --> 00:33:21,274
(Yummy) 

852
00:33:22,041 --> 00:33:23,974
With Campari, it tastes bitter. 

853
00:33:23,974 --> 00:33:25,908
With Aperol, it tastes sweet. 

854
00:33:26,874 --> 00:33:31,041
(Spritz, $5.20 per glass) 

855
00:33:32,374 --> 00:33:35,041
It's bitter, so it stimulates your appetite. 

856
00:33:36,074 --> 00:33:37,374
I keep drinking it though. 

857
00:33:37,674 --> 00:33:39,941
Because it's bitter, you keep sipping on it. 

858
00:33:39,941 --> 00:33:41,974
I keep salivating. 

859
00:33:41,974 --> 00:33:44,708
Rather than with sweetness, 

860
00:33:44,708 --> 00:33:45,708
appetite is often stimulated 

861
00:33:45,708 --> 00:33:47,008
with bitterness or sourness. 

862
00:33:47,008 --> 00:33:49,141
So this is a good aperitif. 

863
00:33:49,574 --> 00:33:51,074
Here it is. 

864
00:33:51,074 --> 00:33:52,208
(Their food is served) 

865
00:33:52,208 --> 00:33:53,308
There's the food. 

866
00:33:54,441 --> 00:33:57,841
(For antipasto, they're having octopus) 

867
00:33:57,841 --> 00:33:59,608
Octopus appetizer must be delicious. 

868
00:34:00,608 --> 00:34:02,008
(Wow) 

869
00:34:02,008 --> 00:34:03,174
Look at that. 

870
00:34:03,174 --> 00:34:04,474
- Amazing. / - Look at that. 

871
00:34:07,574 --> 00:34:10,674
(Octopus dish, $15.60) 

872
00:34:10,674 --> 00:34:12,574
Octopus is chewy in Korea. 

873
00:34:12,574 --> 00:34:13,541
But it is tender in Italy. 

874
00:34:13,541 --> 00:34:16,241
You can crush it with your tongue. 

875
00:34:17,674 --> 00:34:19,841
(He's excited to eat) 

876
00:34:19,841 --> 00:34:21,074
It's so tender. 

877
00:34:22,308 --> 00:34:23,374
It's so smooth. 

878
00:34:23,374 --> 00:34:24,741
(It's super easy to cut) 

879
00:34:24,741 --> 00:34:25,874
Sweet pumpkin sauce. 

880
00:34:25,874 --> 00:34:27,574
(Octopus with sweet pumpkin sauce) 

881
00:34:27,574 --> 00:34:28,674
Pistachio. 

882
00:34:28,674 --> 00:34:30,008
(Octopus with sweet pumpkin sauce and pistachio) 

883
00:34:30,708 --> 00:34:31,874
I want to eat octopus. 

884
00:34:31,874 --> 00:34:34,241
(They each take a bite) 

885
00:34:34,241 --> 00:34:36,208
(What?) 

886
00:34:36,874 --> 00:34:38,174
It's like fish. 

887
00:34:39,174 --> 00:34:40,541
Yes, it's like fish. 

888
00:34:40,541 --> 00:34:42,341
The fork goes right in. 

889
00:34:42,341 --> 00:34:44,874
- You're right. / - It's really tender. 

890
00:34:45,274 --> 00:34:47,141
You can crush it with your tongue. 

891
00:34:47,708 --> 00:34:49,441
- How did they do this? / - How can it be so soft? 

892
00:34:49,441 --> 00:34:53,408
In Korea, we usually blanch the octopus slightly 

893
00:34:53,408 --> 00:34:55,741
and enjoy the chewy and firm texture of the octopus. 

894
00:34:55,741 --> 00:34:58,741
But in Europe, they completely cook the octopus. 

895
00:34:58,741 --> 00:35:01,408
Just like pork slices are soft when we steam them. 

896
00:35:01,408 --> 00:35:02,974
Europeans thoroughly cook the octopus 

897
00:35:02,974 --> 00:35:04,974
so they're tender. 

898
00:35:04,974 --> 00:35:07,108
This is great. This is excellent. 

899
00:35:07,108 --> 00:35:08,808
(White wine is the best for seafood) 

900
00:35:08,808 --> 00:35:09,941
That wine was great. 

901
00:35:10,974 --> 00:35:12,274
(The wine is aromatic) 

902
00:35:12,274 --> 00:35:13,808
I like this wine. 

903
00:35:13,808 --> 00:35:15,041
I personally like this wine. 

904
00:35:15,041 --> 00:35:16,808
The wine goes really well with the dish. 

905
00:35:17,008 --> 00:35:19,441
Lugana. Both of them are from this region. 

906
00:35:19,941 --> 00:35:21,308
I'm going to eat the octopus. 

907
00:35:21,308 --> 00:35:22,574
(Sook has caved in after the consecutive attacks) 

908
00:35:22,574 --> 00:35:23,808
I'll put this on the bottom now. 

909
00:35:25,074 --> 00:35:27,541
It was really good. The wine was fantastic. 

910
00:35:27,841 --> 00:35:29,674
The dish and the wine make the perfect pair. 

911
00:35:29,674 --> 00:35:32,274
At this restaurant, make sure you order Traminer. 

912
00:35:32,574 --> 00:35:34,008
I was informed that this wine is a local one. 

913
00:35:34,308 --> 00:35:37,974
- It smells very flowery. / - It's aromatic. 

914
00:35:37,974 --> 00:35:40,708
- It's not dry. It has many scents. / - This is very dry. 

915
00:35:40,708 --> 00:35:41,708
This one is called Lugana. 

916
00:35:42,508 --> 00:35:45,208
It's not aromatic but it's refreshing. 

917
00:35:45,208 --> 00:35:47,508
If you like feeling refreshed, you'd like this wine. 

918
00:35:47,508 --> 00:35:50,108
- Ask them for aromatic and dry one. / - Right. 

919
00:35:50,108 --> 00:35:52,041
Tell them you don't want sweet wine. 

920
00:35:52,041 --> 00:35:53,508
I think they make a recommendation. 

921
00:35:54,041 --> 00:35:55,608
You ought to drink wine for a meal like that. 

922
00:35:55,608 --> 00:35:57,641
Since Italians enjoy drinking wine, 

923
00:35:57,641 --> 00:36:00,108
they produce a lot of it and it's cheap too. 

924
00:36:00,108 --> 00:36:03,308
When you go to Italy, you have to try their wine. 

925
00:36:03,308 --> 00:36:05,941
The octopus and the white wine must be... 

926
00:36:05,941 --> 00:36:07,308
- Really delicious. / - It is. 

927
00:36:07,308 --> 00:36:08,508
- It was great. / - When did that... 

928
00:36:08,508 --> 00:36:10,241
- When did you put it in 1st place? / - I put it in 1st. 

929
00:36:10,241 --> 00:36:13,241
I like the chewy texture of the octopus. 

930
00:36:16,008 --> 00:36:17,708
It's good. This place is great. 

931
00:36:18,574 --> 00:36:21,208
I was worried a little but this is pretty delicious. 

932
00:36:21,574 --> 00:36:23,441
I can't wait to try the pasta. 

933
00:36:23,441 --> 00:36:25,108
Our pasta is coming. 

934
00:36:25,108 --> 00:36:29,074
(Time for squid ink pasta) 

935
00:36:29,074 --> 00:36:30,441
- The squid ink pasta. / - My goodness. 

936
00:36:30,441 --> 00:36:32,341
I'm dying to try squid ink pasta. I'm so curious. 

937
00:36:32,341 --> 00:36:34,708
- We know how that tastes. / - It's really curious. 

938
00:36:34,708 --> 00:36:36,141
That's made with fresh pasta. 

939
00:36:36,708 --> 00:36:38,541
Really? 

940
00:36:39,941 --> 00:36:41,708
Alright. Let me try it now. 

941
00:36:41,708 --> 00:36:44,541
(They try Venice's representative dish) 

942
00:36:48,341 --> 00:36:49,874
They're eating it with gusto. 

943
00:36:50,808 --> 00:36:52,508
I really loved the pasta. They were perfect. 

944
00:36:52,508 --> 00:36:54,441
- That looks really good. / - Yes, it was really good. 

945
00:36:54,441 --> 00:36:56,108
That looks amazing. 

946
00:36:56,474 --> 00:36:58,008
The pasta is really unique. 

947
00:36:59,074 --> 00:37:00,274
This tastes really good. 

948
00:37:00,708 --> 00:37:03,174
I feel like I'm chewing thick buckwheat noodles. 

949
00:37:03,174 --> 00:37:04,941
Look. The pasta is shining because of the oil. 

950
00:37:04,941 --> 00:37:06,741
- I should try that in Korea. / - I should too. 

951
00:37:06,741 --> 00:37:09,308
I can taste the savory flavor of the squid itself. 

952
00:37:09,308 --> 00:37:11,108
I can taste the savory flavor from the squid ink. 

953
00:37:11,108 --> 00:37:13,508
- Don't you smell the olive oil? / - Right. 

954
00:37:14,108 --> 00:37:16,374
It's very simple, yet delicious. 

955
00:37:16,941 --> 00:37:19,341
(Slurping) 

956
00:37:20,274 --> 00:37:21,374
(This is killing me) 

957
00:37:21,374 --> 00:37:23,041
I've never tasted a dish like this one. I mean it. 

958
00:37:24,674 --> 00:37:26,574
The highlight of a pasta dish is the pasta. 

959
00:37:26,574 --> 00:37:28,608
- Yes, the pasta. / - They know how to enhance... 

960
00:37:28,608 --> 00:37:30,341
- The flavors to the fullest. / - Exactly. 

961
00:37:31,041 --> 00:37:33,774
I guess pasta is the best in Italy. 

962
00:37:34,341 --> 00:37:38,274
(Now it's time for the assorted fried seafood) 

963
00:37:41,008 --> 00:37:45,741
(Assorted fried seafood, $28.60) 

964
00:37:46,308 --> 00:37:48,068
(Battle Trip Part 2 will be aired soon) 

965
00:37:48,068 --> 00:37:50,554
(Now it's time for the assorted fried seafood) 

966
00:37:50,554 --> 00:37:51,821
It's the dish that everyone in the world loves. 

967
00:37:51,821 --> 00:37:52,788
It's fried food. 

968
00:37:52,788 --> 00:37:55,788
- My gosh. It's driving me crazy. / - It's seafood. 

969
00:37:55,788 --> 00:37:56,854
You have to fry seafood. 

970
00:37:56,854 --> 00:37:58,888
- Amazing. / - The shrimp and I made eye contact. 

971
00:37:59,554 --> 00:38:01,554
You guys are so cruel. This dish looks so delicious. 

972
00:38:01,554 --> 00:38:02,988
Should we try it? 

973
00:38:02,988 --> 00:38:04,688
(They keep on eating without a break) 

974
00:38:04,688 --> 00:38:07,121
- They perfectly seasoned it. / - Really? 

975
00:38:07,121 --> 00:38:08,321
The shrimp is great. 

976
00:38:10,621 --> 00:38:12,221
Their seafood is amazing. 

977
00:38:12,221 --> 00:38:13,788
Venice is known for its seafood. 

978
00:38:13,788 --> 00:38:15,288
(Venice has the best seafood) 

979
00:38:15,288 --> 00:38:17,854
They chopped the body of the squid. 

980
00:38:18,021 --> 00:38:20,821
It's not tough and not too tender. 

981
00:38:21,188 --> 00:38:22,688
- This is delicious. / - Seafood must be fresh. 

982
00:38:22,688 --> 00:38:24,488
Nothing more to it, right? 

983
00:38:28,121 --> 00:38:29,388
That's crazy. 

984
00:38:29,788 --> 00:38:30,788
Mayonnaise is the best sauce for fried food. 

985
00:38:31,821 --> 00:38:33,188
This is good. 

986
00:38:33,188 --> 00:38:34,388
- It's sweet. / - Yes. 

987
00:38:34,388 --> 00:38:36,388
When they make the frying mix, 

988
00:38:36,388 --> 00:38:38,288
they are really good at seasoning the mix. 

989
00:38:38,288 --> 00:38:41,221
Venice has its own method of frying food. 

990
00:38:41,221 --> 00:38:42,954
They soak the ingredients in milk, 

991
00:38:42,954 --> 00:38:44,754
coat them with flour then fry them. 

992
00:38:45,521 --> 00:38:47,454
The batter is very thin. 

993
00:38:48,154 --> 00:38:50,354
- They sliced the eggplants. / - This is to die for. 

994
00:38:51,221 --> 00:38:52,388
Fried eggplants are the best. 

995
00:38:52,954 --> 00:38:54,888
Hey, this just calls for beer. 

996
00:38:55,254 --> 00:38:58,321
(Beer is the way to go with fried food) 

997
00:38:58,321 --> 00:39:00,554
Seriously? You're drinking beer too? 

998
00:39:00,554 --> 00:39:03,254
- What? / - I ordered beer. I had to. 

999
00:39:03,754 --> 00:39:06,354
- Fried food and beer. / - This isn't a gourmet trip. 

1000
00:39:06,354 --> 00:39:07,821
We had no choice. We were having fried food. 

1001
00:39:08,288 --> 00:39:09,754
Exactly. Beer is the way to go. 

1002
00:39:10,954 --> 00:39:13,688
With beer, everything falls into place. 

1003
00:39:14,654 --> 00:39:17,088
Since we're in Venice, it's even tastier. 

1004
00:39:17,088 --> 00:39:18,454
This is nice. 

1005
00:39:18,854 --> 00:39:19,988
The white wine was great. 

1006
00:39:20,454 --> 00:39:21,954
Both types of white wine were great. 

1007
00:39:21,954 --> 00:39:24,488
(Sikyung recommends the squid ink pasta) 

1008
00:39:24,488 --> 00:39:27,021
(Joonwoo also recommends the pasta) 

1009
00:39:27,021 --> 00:39:29,521
(A meal that can be enjoyed casually) 

1010
00:39:29,521 --> 00:39:32,021
(The total rating is 3.67 stars) 

1011
00:39:32,021 --> 00:39:33,788
I think it had the opposite effect. 

1012
00:39:33,788 --> 00:39:35,921
The trip became about food pairing for drinks. 

1013
00:39:35,921 --> 00:39:38,154
When it comes to fine food, you also enjoy drinks... 

1014
00:39:38,154 --> 00:39:39,721
- And the culture. / - You're right. 

1015
00:39:40,288 --> 00:39:41,654
I should agree. It's true. 

1016
00:39:43,554 --> 00:39:45,254
- We came all the way here. / - Okay. 

1017
00:39:45,254 --> 00:39:47,988
- We must ride the gondola. / - That's right. 

1018
00:39:47,988 --> 00:39:49,921
- If not, it'd be disappointing. / - Exactly. 

1019
00:39:52,121 --> 00:39:55,054
(10-minute walk to gondola station from the restaurant) 

1020
00:39:55,054 --> 00:39:57,988
(The stations are scattered all over the city) 

1021
00:39:58,654 --> 00:40:01,821
(It's the symbol of Venice) 

1022
00:40:01,821 --> 00:40:04,721
(And the most representative tourist attraction) 

1023
00:40:04,721 --> 00:40:07,154
When we go underneath that... 

1024
00:40:07,688 --> 00:40:09,288
You're going into the shade. 

1025
00:40:10,121 --> 00:40:11,521
It makes you happy. 

1026
00:40:11,888 --> 00:40:13,854
- I get why people go on gondolas. / - Right. 

1027
00:40:13,854 --> 00:40:14,654
I really want to go there. 

1028
00:40:14,654 --> 00:40:16,054
Especially for my honeymoon. 

1029
00:40:16,054 --> 00:40:19,321
(Gondola) 

1030
00:40:19,321 --> 00:40:20,921
Two men went on the gondola together. 

1031
00:40:20,921 --> 00:40:22,854
(What a shame that it's just two guys) 

1032
00:40:23,821 --> 00:40:24,921
You know what? 

1033
00:40:25,521 --> 00:40:28,354
It felt much better than I thought it would. 

1034
00:40:28,354 --> 00:40:31,188
Despite the fact it was just us two, it was great. 

1035
00:40:33,621 --> 00:40:34,988
(The 20 to 30-minute ride, $104) 

1036
00:40:34,988 --> 00:40:36,554
(A maximum of 6 people can ride it) 

1037
00:40:36,554 --> 00:40:37,988
- Be careful. / - Thank you. 

1038
00:40:38,854 --> 00:40:41,021
(They board the gondola) 

1039
00:40:41,021 --> 00:40:42,788
We're complete tourists. 

1040
00:40:42,788 --> 00:40:43,954
(They become tourists) 

1041
00:40:44,854 --> 00:40:46,888
- We're off now. / - How is this moving? 

1042
00:40:47,621 --> 00:40:48,654
What's happening? 

1043
00:40:50,954 --> 00:40:52,421
Hey, this feels great. 

1044
00:40:53,221 --> 00:40:56,021
This is the water scent we can smell on the water. 

1045
00:40:56,021 --> 00:40:57,488
It's different. 

1046
00:40:58,754 --> 00:41:00,621
It was nice to be over there too. 

1047
00:41:00,954 --> 00:41:02,721
The atmosphere was great near the waterside too. 

1048
00:41:03,021 --> 00:41:05,121
It's much better on the water. 

1049
00:41:05,121 --> 00:41:06,654
(It was made in the 11th century to navigate canals) 

1050
00:41:06,654 --> 00:41:07,654
- Look at the people. / - My gosh. 

1051
00:41:07,654 --> 00:41:08,488
(Gondola means to shake in Italian) 

1052
00:41:09,421 --> 00:41:10,188
(Hey, tourists, look at that over there) 

1053
00:41:10,188 --> 00:41:11,888
- King palace? / - Yes. 

1054
00:41:12,421 --> 00:41:13,554
(Doge's Palace is a museum now) 

1055
00:41:13,554 --> 00:41:16,154
This is a museum now but it used to be a palace. 

1056
00:41:17,854 --> 00:41:21,488
- That's the Bridge of Sighs. / - Yes. 

1057
00:41:21,488 --> 00:41:23,521
Bridge of Sighs? That's the Bridge of Sighs. 

1058
00:41:24,088 --> 00:41:25,854
That building was the court 

1059
00:41:25,854 --> 00:41:27,321
and that one was the prison. 

1060
00:41:27,688 --> 00:41:30,321
When they had to cross the bridge, they sighed. 

1061
00:41:30,321 --> 00:41:32,054
That's where the name comes from. 

1062
00:41:32,821 --> 00:41:34,621
I've heard of its name a lot. 

1063
00:41:34,621 --> 00:41:36,154
(Even Casanova crossed the Bridge of Sighs) 

1064
00:41:36,721 --> 00:41:38,954
Even that over there is pretty. 

1065
00:41:38,954 --> 00:41:39,888
Everything here is pretty. 

1066
00:41:39,888 --> 00:41:41,588
- So much detail. / - Yes. 

1067
00:41:41,588 --> 00:41:42,721
The traces of history. 

1068
00:41:42,721 --> 00:41:46,054
(The trace of a long history is visibly evident) 

1069
00:41:46,054 --> 00:41:48,521
I've never ridden this because it's expensive. 

1070
00:41:48,521 --> 00:41:49,788
But this is worth the money. 

1071
00:41:50,921 --> 00:41:51,454
It's expensive. 

1072
00:41:51,454 --> 00:41:55,154
It's very expensive but I hope you would ride it. 

1073
00:41:55,154 --> 00:41:57,488
It was really nice to look at the alleys on the gondola. 

1074
00:41:57,488 --> 00:41:58,488
I can see that. 

1075
00:41:59,654 --> 00:42:01,988
I can just sit on the gondola... 

1076
00:42:02,621 --> 00:42:04,588
To enjoy the atmosphere. 

1077
00:42:04,588 --> 00:42:06,221
- Hello. / - Hello. 

1078
00:42:07,554 --> 00:42:10,688
It's nice to relax 

1079
00:42:10,688 --> 00:42:12,021
once in a while. 

1080
00:42:12,754 --> 00:42:15,788
How could it not smell fishy here? 

1081
00:42:15,788 --> 00:42:17,421
- It's cool here. / - It's so pretty. 

1082
00:42:17,421 --> 00:42:18,488
It's so beautiful. 

1083
00:42:18,488 --> 00:42:19,888
I told you. It's beautiful. 

1084
00:42:19,888 --> 00:42:20,954
(It feels like being in a movie) 

1085
00:42:20,954 --> 00:42:23,921
- It's like I'm in an Italian film. / - Right. 

1086
00:42:25,454 --> 00:42:26,988
This is an interesting scene. 

1087
00:42:28,654 --> 00:42:30,288
- That was really nice. / - My gosh. 

1088
00:42:30,288 --> 00:42:31,788
(It's so peaceful that he even feels drowsy) 

1089
00:42:31,788 --> 00:42:33,821
The air feels friendly. 

1090
00:42:33,821 --> 00:42:35,321
- Yes, you're so right. / - You know what I mean? 

1091
00:42:35,321 --> 00:42:36,488
- That was a great expression. / - Yes. 

1092
00:42:36,488 --> 00:42:39,588
You can even fall asleep here. 

1093
00:42:39,588 --> 00:42:41,254
(These two jump into Venice on their gondola ride) 

1094
00:42:42,221 --> 00:42:44,921
If you think about it, we wouldn't be able to see 

1095
00:42:44,921 --> 00:42:47,021
these waterways without the gondola ride. 

1096
00:42:47,554 --> 00:42:49,654
I can't believe I got to ride a gondola. 

1097
00:42:50,488 --> 00:42:52,421
- This is my first time. / - Same here. 

1098
00:42:53,354 --> 00:42:55,154
Both of our first times are with a guy. 

1099
00:42:56,521 --> 00:42:59,821
(Feeling bitter) 

1100
00:43:00,288 --> 00:43:01,821
- Here's a surprise. Keep watching. / - What is it? 

1101
00:43:03,821 --> 00:43:04,821
Gosh, he proposed? 

1102
00:43:04,821 --> 00:43:06,621
- He proposed? No way. / - My goodness. 

1103
00:43:06,621 --> 00:43:08,388
(He's touched) 

1104
00:43:08,954 --> 00:43:10,888
- Who proposed? / - What is it? 

1105
00:43:10,888 --> 00:43:12,288
(There's a proposal?) 

1106
00:43:13,554 --> 00:43:18,888
(It's as if they're the only ones there) 

1107
00:43:18,888 --> 00:43:21,221
- This is amazing. / - She must be so happy. 

1108
00:43:21,221 --> 00:43:22,921
I can't believe it. 

1109
00:43:22,921 --> 00:43:25,421
(The couple promise to spend their future together) 

1110
00:43:27,388 --> 00:43:28,821
(They witness the proposal by chance) 

1111
00:43:28,821 --> 00:43:31,621
I bet a lot of people propose to their loved ones here. 

1112
00:43:31,988 --> 00:43:36,088
Oh, my gosh. 

1113
00:43:38,288 --> 00:43:39,988
My gosh. 

1114
00:43:39,988 --> 00:43:41,354
She's crying. 

1115
00:43:41,354 --> 00:43:43,921
- She's crying. / - Oh, my. 

1116
00:43:44,621 --> 00:43:46,054
(Watching quietly) 

1117
00:43:46,054 --> 00:43:48,354
This is not a common thing to see in Korea. 

1118
00:43:48,354 --> 00:43:49,921
Both of them are crying. 

1119
00:43:49,921 --> 00:43:52,754
(It's so touching) 

1120
00:43:52,754 --> 00:43:53,921
This is beautiful. 

1121
00:43:55,488 --> 00:43:57,654
- People are giving blessings. / - We wish you joy. 

1122
00:43:57,854 --> 00:43:59,888
I've never seen anyone proposing. 

1123
00:44:01,088 --> 00:44:02,288
It's very romantic here. 

1124
00:44:04,154 --> 00:44:06,221
I can't believe I just saw someone proposing. 

1125
00:44:06,888 --> 00:44:07,988
Tell me about it. 

1126
00:44:08,954 --> 00:44:11,421
(We wish your love lasts forever) 

1127
00:44:12,588 --> 00:44:17,421
(The water of Venice is full of lovey-dovey couples) 

1128
00:44:19,388 --> 00:44:21,488
I'm suddenly feeling very lonely. 

1129
00:44:21,921 --> 00:44:23,554
- After seeing the proposal? / - Yes. 

1130
00:44:23,888 --> 00:44:25,721
I can imagine. 

1131
00:44:26,154 --> 00:44:27,254
I'll stay as far away from you as possible. 

1132
00:44:27,254 --> 00:44:29,988
It's not because of you. I'm the one to blame. 

1133
00:44:30,554 --> 00:44:31,854
I always sing at other people's weddings. 

1134
00:44:32,854 --> 00:44:34,121
He sings at other people's weddings. 

1135
00:44:34,954 --> 00:44:37,854
Speaking of which, who will sing at your wedding? 

1136
00:44:37,854 --> 00:44:39,021
I guess I should. 

1137
00:44:40,388 --> 00:44:43,188
(We invite a bride to) 

1138
00:44:43,188 --> 00:44:46,954
(Sikyung's wedding) 

1139
00:44:46,954 --> 00:44:49,721
Look at the picture. He took a great wedding picture. 

1140
00:44:49,721 --> 00:44:51,388
- Self wedding photos. / - He did it himself? 

1141
00:44:51,988 --> 00:44:54,021
Sikyung, you took such a nice picture. 

1142
00:44:55,454 --> 00:44:57,021
(Everyone loves this Italian ice cream) 

1143
00:44:57,021 --> 00:44:58,254
- It's gelato. / - It looks delicious. 

1144
00:45:03,021 --> 00:45:05,088
Finally, this is Italian gelato. 

1145
00:45:05,088 --> 00:45:07,854
- I love gelato. / - It looks so delicious. 

1146
00:45:07,854 --> 00:45:09,188
(Everyone is holding this) 

1147
00:45:09,188 --> 00:45:10,488
(Italy Gourmet Tour) 

1148
00:45:10,488 --> 00:45:14,121
(Gelato) 

1149
00:45:15,588 --> 00:45:18,321
(One peaceful afternoon in Venice) 

1150
00:45:18,321 --> 00:45:21,354
Isn't Venice beautiful at dusk? 

1151
00:45:21,788 --> 00:45:23,854
Our first coffee in Venice was great. 

1152
00:45:23,854 --> 00:45:25,021
It was the best. 

1153
00:45:25,021 --> 00:45:27,388
Let's go try our first gelato here. 

1154
00:45:27,388 --> 00:45:29,788
- It's nearby. / - Our first gelato in Venice. 

1155
00:45:29,788 --> 00:45:31,888
Exactly. This place is... 

1156
00:45:31,888 --> 00:45:32,888
It should be delicious. 

1157
00:45:32,888 --> 00:45:36,388
This place is famous for hazelnut chocolate ice cream. 

1158
00:45:36,854 --> 00:45:40,288
It's a must-try in Venice. I heard it's very unique. 

1159
00:45:40,288 --> 00:45:41,454
Okay. Where do we order? 

1160
00:45:41,454 --> 00:45:42,821
I guess we can order here. 

1161
00:45:44,954 --> 00:45:47,454
(Rich chocolate gelato with hazelnuts) 

1162
00:45:47,454 --> 00:45:49,321
(Dipped in cream) 

1163
00:45:50,454 --> 00:45:52,488
(Automatic reaction) 

1164
00:45:53,321 --> 00:45:54,821
This deserves it. 

1165
00:45:54,821 --> 00:45:58,321
- This is unfair. / - It's gelato. 

1166
00:46:03,454 --> 00:46:06,888
(They order chewy original gelato as well) 

1167
00:46:07,954 --> 00:46:11,688
(Hazelnut gelato and 3 scoop gelato, $8.50 each) 

1168
00:46:14,488 --> 00:46:20,254
(They charge you for seating instead of tips) 

1169
00:46:21,254 --> 00:46:24,854
(Here comes the gelato) 

1170
00:46:24,854 --> 00:46:27,021
This has to top the chart. 

1171
00:46:27,021 --> 00:46:29,421
(Lemon, chocolate chips, tiramisu) 

1172
00:46:30,388 --> 00:46:32,854
- This is whipped cream, isn't it? / - Yes, it is. 

1173
00:46:32,854 --> 00:46:34,821
Actually, I don't eat a lot of sweet things. 

1174
00:46:34,821 --> 00:46:36,088
I'm more of a drinker. 

1175
00:46:36,088 --> 00:46:38,254
- But he's an expert with sweets. / - I love sweets. 

1176
00:46:38,688 --> 00:46:39,921
Since he's a dessert expert. 

1177
00:46:40,754 --> 00:46:42,488
It doesn't have much sugar in it. It's okay. 

1178
00:46:42,488 --> 00:46:43,754
- This one? / - Yes. 

1179
00:46:44,754 --> 00:46:45,754
It has little bit of sugar in it. 

1180
00:46:47,454 --> 00:46:49,288
The whipped cream has a very light texture. 

1181
00:46:49,288 --> 00:46:50,788
This whipped cream is supposed to be eaten 

1182
00:46:50,788 --> 00:46:52,088
with the ice cream. 

1183
00:46:52,354 --> 00:46:56,254
Which means this gelato should be pretty sweet. 

1184
00:46:56,254 --> 00:46:58,088
Let me try it first, since I don't like sweet things. 

1185
00:46:58,521 --> 00:47:01,154
(What does the hazelnut gelato taste like?) 

1186
00:47:03,688 --> 00:47:05,888
It was really sweet. 

1187
00:47:05,888 --> 00:47:07,421
(Let me see how it tastes) 

1188
00:47:11,221 --> 00:47:12,121
(He's touched by its rich flavor) 

1189
00:47:12,121 --> 00:47:13,721
- Do you like it? / - It's very deep. 

1190
00:47:14,388 --> 00:47:16,454
If it's supposed to be sweet, it should be real sweet. 

1191
00:47:17,288 --> 00:47:20,588
It has chopped hazelnuts inside. 

1192
00:47:20,588 --> 00:47:23,521
As far as I know, this is the Northern Italian style 

1193
00:47:23,521 --> 00:47:24,788
to eat chocolate and hazelnuts together. 

1194
00:47:24,788 --> 00:47:28,154
It's called gianduiotto. 

1195
00:47:28,154 --> 00:47:31,421
If you're in this town, you have to try this ice cream. 

1196
00:47:31,421 --> 00:47:33,288
Depending on your taste, 

1197
00:47:33,288 --> 00:47:34,888
you can ask them to remove 

1198
00:47:34,888 --> 00:47:37,088
the whipped cream and eat only the ice cream. 

1199
00:47:37,488 --> 00:47:39,954
You can say, "Senza panna" to order 

1200
00:47:39,954 --> 00:47:42,254
the ice cream without the cream. 

1201
00:47:42,588 --> 00:47:45,521
So you can just eat the ice cream. 

1202
00:47:45,521 --> 00:47:47,854
- "Senza panna." / - "Senza panna." 

1203
00:47:47,854 --> 00:47:50,021
"Panna" is from "panna cotta." 

1204
00:47:50,354 --> 00:47:52,388
- "No cream." / - You can say that too. 

1205
00:47:52,388 --> 00:47:53,388
No cream. 

1206
00:47:53,388 --> 00:47:55,188
It seemed like they could speak English. 

1207
00:47:55,188 --> 00:47:56,321
I'm going to eat this. 

1208
00:47:57,921 --> 00:48:00,688
(It's time to try the original Italian gelato) 

1209
00:48:00,688 --> 00:48:02,654
It looks delicious. I want to try it. 

1210
00:48:04,021 --> 00:48:05,688
Let me start with the lemon flavor. 

1211
00:48:06,321 --> 00:48:08,188
I know people love Italian gelato. 

1212
00:48:09,754 --> 00:48:10,821
But it shouldn't be that special. 

1213
00:48:10,821 --> 00:48:13,021
That lemon gelato looks really delicious. 

1214
00:48:13,354 --> 00:48:14,354
How is it? 

1215
00:48:14,354 --> 00:48:15,521
(This is it) 

1216
00:48:15,521 --> 00:48:16,621
It's really good. 

1217
00:48:16,621 --> 00:48:18,288
- Is it? / - This doesn't exist in Korea. 

1218
00:48:19,454 --> 00:48:21,054
(Happy) 

1219
00:48:21,054 --> 00:48:23,388
- It was delicious. / - He looks so happy. 

1220
00:48:23,388 --> 00:48:24,588
It's like sorbet. 

1221
00:48:25,054 --> 00:48:26,254
They have great lemon gelato. 

1222
00:48:27,788 --> 00:48:29,888
Italy has some good coffee and gelato. 

1223
00:48:30,888 --> 00:48:31,954
It's very light. 

1224
00:48:32,221 --> 00:48:33,621
It's supposed to be heavy 

1225
00:48:33,621 --> 00:48:34,921
but it's so light in my mouth. 

1226
00:48:35,388 --> 00:48:37,521
This one? Is it tiramisu flavor? 

1227
00:48:37,521 --> 00:48:38,954
You should try tiramisu flavor. 

1228
00:48:39,754 --> 00:48:43,188
Do you know the caramel flavored Korean ice cream? 

1229
00:48:43,688 --> 00:48:45,288
It's like that but a lot fancier. 

1230
00:48:45,854 --> 00:48:47,421
It's so chewy. 

1231
00:48:48,254 --> 00:48:49,288
It's like a cheesecake. 

1232
00:48:51,021 --> 00:48:52,954
(I love it) 

1233
00:48:52,954 --> 00:48:56,921
You'll have to run 40km after eating all that. 

1234
00:48:58,688 --> 00:49:01,521
You don't talk about calories when it comes to gelato. 

1235
00:49:01,521 --> 00:49:03,221
It's rude to say that. 

1236
00:49:03,221 --> 00:49:04,621
That was very impolite of him. 

1237
00:49:05,821 --> 00:49:08,154
I never buy myself sweets 

1238
00:49:08,154 --> 00:49:10,921
but now I get why people love gelato so much. 

1239
00:49:10,921 --> 00:49:12,188
(Everyone loves the traditional Italian gelato) 

1240
00:49:12,454 --> 00:49:15,354
I recommend the tiramisu flavor. 

1241
00:49:15,354 --> 00:49:17,454
(Sikyung's favorite is the tiramisu flavored gelato) 

1242
00:49:17,888 --> 00:49:20,088
If you come here with someone, try gianduiotto. 

1243
00:49:20,088 --> 00:49:21,988
And if you come here alone, try the lemon gelato. 

1244
00:49:21,988 --> 00:49:23,554
- What was lemon in Italian again? / - Limone. 

1245
00:49:23,554 --> 00:49:24,754
Limone. 

1246
00:49:24,754 --> 00:49:26,654
I usually don't like desserts but I ate most of it. 

1247
00:49:26,654 --> 00:49:28,154
The lemon gelato was really good. 

1248
00:49:28,154 --> 00:49:29,421
Seriously, it's pretty good. 

1249
00:49:29,421 --> 00:49:31,854
I think Italy has the best gelato. 

1250
00:49:31,854 --> 00:49:34,588
- My goodness. / - It looks so delicious.

Street lamps are all we need 

1254
00:49:47,788 --> 00:49:49,521
for the beautiful European night view. 

1255
00:49:49,521 --> 00:49:51,321
It's because the buildings are so beautiful. 

1256
00:49:51,321 --> 00:49:54,288
So this is Santa Maria della Salute. 

1257
00:49:54,288 --> 00:49:56,421
- It's nice. / - It looks awesome. 

1258
00:49:56,421 --> 00:49:59,421
Is this where you can see a beautiful view? 

1259
00:49:59,421 --> 00:50:01,121
This is one of the places you can see 

1260
00:50:01,121 --> 00:50:02,854
a beautiful sunset. 

1261
00:50:02,854 --> 00:50:05,821
It's very calm and atmospheric today. 

1262
00:50:06,254 --> 00:50:09,121
This is Santa Maria della Salute. 

1263
00:50:10,021 --> 00:50:12,054
You can go to all those places by foot. 

1264
00:50:12,054 --> 00:50:14,288
It takes 10 to 20 minutes. 

1265
00:50:14,288 --> 00:50:15,654
It's nice here too. 

1266
00:50:15,654 --> 00:50:18,654
But also is the terrace in the department store. 

1267
00:50:18,654 --> 00:50:20,121
You can use the rooftop for 

1268
00:50:20,121 --> 00:50:21,854
15 minutes with a reservation. 

1269
00:50:21,854 --> 00:50:23,388
You can't eat anything up there though. 

1270
00:50:23,388 --> 00:50:25,854
- Is the reservation free? / - Yes, you just need to book. 

1271
00:50:25,854 --> 00:50:28,754
It's another nice sunset spot. 

1272
00:50:28,754 --> 00:50:30,521
This is also a famous place. 

1273
00:50:32,054 --> 00:50:33,454
It's so beautiful.

00:50:35,021 --> 00:50:39,021
(The day slowly ends) 

1275
00:50:39,021 --> 00:50:41,421
Oh, right. There's something I have to tell you. 

1276
00:50:41,421 --> 00:50:43,821
It's fun to drink wine in this kind of places 

1277
00:50:43,821 --> 00:50:47,054
but because of so many drunk people on the street... 

1278
00:50:47,421 --> 00:50:49,621
Venice is considering setting up 

1279
00:50:49,621 --> 00:50:51,254
an ordinance banning such actions. 

1280
00:50:51,254 --> 00:50:52,621
- So please keep that in mind. / - That's sad. 

1281
00:50:52,621 --> 00:50:55,321
I hope the weather is nice tomorrow. 

1282

I think it will be. I have a good feeling.

Since your an expert at food and wine, 

1284
00:50:59,321 --> 00:51:00,288
I believe you've made reservations 

1285
00:51:00,288 --> 00:51:00,988
for good restaurants. 

1286
00:51:00,988 --> 00:51:02,954
- I did. / - Oh, well. 

1287
00:51:03,688 --> 00:51:05,421

I prepared something. 

1291

00:55:41,954 --> 00:55:43,954
There's Murano and Burano. 

1390
00:55:43,954 --> 00:55:46,754
Murano is famous for glass. 

1391
00:55:46,754 --> 00:55:48,121
- Glass crafts? / - Yes. 

1392
00:55:48,121 --> 00:55:50,621
- I see. / - If you go a little further... 

1393
00:55:50,621 --> 00:55:53,288
You can get to Burano with colorful buildings. 

1394
00:55:53,288 --> 00:55:54,821
(This is our destination, Burano) 

1395
00:55:54,821 --> 00:55:56,688
I didn't know there was a place like that. 

1396
00:55:57,288 --> 00:55:59,354
(Burano, a fairy-tale island with colorful buildings) 

1397
00:55:59,354 --> 00:56:01,288
It's an island of love. 

1398
00:56:01,288 --> 00:56:02,854
It's so beautiful. 

1399
00:56:02,854 --> 00:56:05,754
How did they paint the walls so beautiful? 

1400
00:56:05,754 --> 00:56:08,421
(The government appoints the colors of the walls) 

1401
00:56:08,421 --> 00:56:10,654
It looks different on screen. 

1402
00:56:10,654 --> 00:56:11,988
- It's so pretty. / - It looks like an amusement park. 

1403
00:56:12,621 --> 00:56:13,854
The place is like an amusement park. 

1404
00:56:14,154 --> 00:56:15,388
I see. 

1405
00:56:15,388 --> 00:56:16,954
A well-made amusement park. 

1406
00:56:17,654 --> 00:56:18,854
This is pretty. 

1407
00:56:20,588 --> 00:56:22,854
Gosh, we can see the buildings here. 

1408
00:56:26,221 --> 00:56:28,888
They have a lot of water fog here, 

1409
00:56:28,888 --> 00:56:31,088
so they colored the walls. 

1410
00:56:31,088 --> 00:56:34,288
To make it easier to find their own houses. 

1411
00:56:34,288 --> 00:56:35,988
To make them stand out. 

1412
00:56:35,988 --> 00:56:37,454
(They painted the walls in different colors) 

1413
00:56:37,454 --> 00:56:38,788
(It's to help identify their houses) 

1414
00:56:39,754 --> 00:56:42,588
- To be honest, one wrong color... / - Yes. 

1415
00:56:42,588 --> 00:56:44,121
And it will just look ugly. 

1416
00:56:44,121 --> 00:56:46,421
- Right. / - It might look tacky. 

1417
00:56:46,421 --> 00:56:49,954
This is what only experts can do. 

1418
00:56:49,954 --> 00:56:52,221
They look beautiful though. 

1419
00:56:52,221 --> 00:56:53,988
(The pastel-colored houses are in harmony) 

1420
00:56:54,721 --> 00:56:55,854
Let's go on a date now. 

1421
00:56:56,188 --> 00:56:57,488
- What? / - Now that we're here. 

1422
00:56:57,488 --> 00:56:58,754
You know what? 

1423
00:56:58,754 --> 00:57:00,054
In Europe... 

1424
00:57:00,388 --> 00:57:02,521
If two men walk together, people think that way. 

1425
00:57:03,254 --> 00:57:05,188
That's true. They really did. 

1426
00:57:05,188 --> 00:57:06,821
They misunderstood us. 

1427
00:57:06,821 --> 00:57:08,721
- It happened to us. / - On our last day. 

1428
00:57:08,721 --> 00:57:11,821
(A famous tourist attraction with colorful buildings) 

1429
00:57:13,754 --> 00:57:16,621
(People take photos with the colorful walls) 

1430
00:57:16,621 --> 00:57:17,888
My gosh. 

1431
00:57:20,088 --> 00:57:22,721
We should take photos with 9 different walls 

1432
00:57:22,721 --> 00:57:25,621
and put them together to get a great picture. 

1433
00:57:25,621 --> 00:57:27,221
It's like 3 times 3? 

1434
00:57:27,221 --> 00:57:29,188
And you should make 9 different expressions. 

1435
00:57:29,188 --> 00:57:30,688
- How? / - I'll do this. 

1436
00:57:30,688 --> 00:57:32,521
I'll take photos with the same expressions... 

1437
00:57:32,854 --> 00:57:34,454
And just change the walls. 

1438
00:57:34,788 --> 00:57:36,488
And you will make 9 different expressions. 

1439
00:57:36,488 --> 00:57:39,754
Why should I do that? 

1440
00:57:40,054 --> 00:57:42,121
- Because I'm older than you. / - I see. 

1441
00:57:42,688 --> 00:57:45,554
There are many beautiful walls in this alley. 

1442
00:57:45,554 --> 00:57:46,788
- Let's choose one. / - Sikyung. 

1443
00:57:46,788 --> 00:57:48,454
Are you taking 9 photos? 

1444
00:57:48,454 --> 00:57:50,854
- You know I hate taking photos. / - I do. 

1445
00:57:50,854 --> 00:57:51,921
But I did it. 

1446
00:57:52,954 --> 00:57:55,588
(Once you get into the narrow alleyway) 

1447
00:57:55,588 --> 00:57:57,988
(You see many colorful walls) 

1448
00:57:57,988 --> 00:57:59,354
It looks amazing. 

1449
00:58:00,088 --> 00:58:02,521
- It's so cute. / - This is nice. 

1450
00:58:02,521 --> 00:58:03,988
I see 9 different colors already. 

1451
00:58:03,988 --> 00:58:05,221
Let's begin here. 

1452
00:58:07,621 --> 00:58:09,121
This isn't good enough. 

1453
00:58:09,121 --> 00:58:10,188
This isn't right? 

1454
00:58:10,188 --> 00:58:13,121
(Now that they're here, Sikyung wants to do it right) 

1455
00:58:13,121 --> 00:58:14,188
What about this wall? 

1456
00:58:14,554 --> 00:58:17,154
It does look good because the wall isn't high enough. 

1457
00:58:17,154 --> 00:58:18,288
We can't do this. 

1458
00:58:19,488 --> 00:58:20,554
He's so sharp. 

1459
00:58:21,554 --> 00:58:22,721
(Long after that) 

1460
00:58:22,721 --> 00:58:23,854
Once Sikyung makes up his mind, 

1461
00:58:23,854 --> 00:58:25,621
he has to do it right. 

1462
00:58:25,621 --> 00:58:27,788
He's looking for the best spots. 

1463
00:58:29,054 --> 00:58:31,854
(Will Sikyung be able to find a wall he likes?) 

1464
00:58:31,854 --> 00:58:33,288
This is it. Stand here. 

1465
00:58:33,288 --> 00:58:34,454
Go behind it. 

1466
00:58:34,854 --> 00:58:37,088
(This is a perfect spot) 

1467
00:58:37,788 --> 00:58:39,288
It was the only wall with that tone of yellow. 

1468
00:58:41,421 --> 00:58:44,188
(A little awkward) 

1469
00:58:45,254 --> 00:58:46,521
(Serious) 

1470
00:58:46,521 --> 00:58:47,988
Do something with your look. 

1471
00:58:48,488 --> 00:58:49,921
(What?) 

1472
00:58:49,921 --> 00:58:51,821
We're the worst photographer and the worst model. 

1473
00:58:54,621 --> 00:58:57,521
(It doesn't feel right) 

1474
00:59:00,688 --> 00:59:01,888
Hurry. 

1475
00:59:02,354 --> 00:59:05,888
(I have to try my best for every shot) 

1476
00:59:07,488 --> 00:59:10,588
(Looks like a photo shoot for his new album) 

1477
00:59:11,321 --> 00:59:13,354
It looked like an album cover. 

1478
00:59:13,354 --> 00:59:14,588
(Passionate) 

1479
00:59:14,588 --> 00:59:16,521
They worked so hard for this. 

1480
00:59:16,521 --> 00:59:17,654
They're so passionate. 

1481
00:59:17,654 --> 00:59:19,221
(He's being the most passionate now) 

1482
00:59:20,421 --> 00:59:21,888
- Joonwoo. / - Yes? 

1483
00:59:21,888 --> 00:59:22,954
You should lie down here. 

1484
00:59:23,921 --> 00:59:26,921
(Shocked) 

1485
00:59:26,921 --> 00:59:28,454
I was looking for a good background. 

1486
00:59:29,188 --> 00:59:31,254
(What is) 

1487
00:59:31,254 --> 00:59:33,088
(Happening right now?) 

1488
00:59:34,054 --> 00:59:36,121
I can see this. 

1489
00:59:36,121 --> 00:59:37,721
Move over. 

1490
00:59:38,221 --> 00:59:39,788
I know it's a good idea, 

1491
00:59:39,788 --> 00:59:41,954
but why did I have to lie down? 

1492
00:59:41,954 --> 00:59:44,388
I wonder if it had to be me. 

1493
00:59:45,454 --> 00:59:46,654
You should turn to the side. 

1494
00:59:46,654 --> 00:59:47,854
(Serious, obedient) 

1495
00:59:47,854 --> 00:59:48,888
I can see my feet. 

1496
00:59:49,654 --> 00:59:50,954
Is it done? 

1497
00:59:50,954 --> 00:59:52,688
There's an app where you can 

1498
00:59:52,688 --> 00:59:54,121
put the photos together. 

1499
00:59:54,121 --> 00:59:54,988
(What would the photo look like?) 

1500
00:59:55,354 --> 00:59:56,554
I'm curious. 

1501
00:59:56,554 --> 00:59:57,621
(Joonwoo's photo) 

1502
00:59:57,621 --> 00:59:58,954
He's lying down. 

1503
00:59:58,954 --> 01:00:00,654
(This is today's best shot) 

1504
01:00:00,988 --> 01:00:02,154
(Sikyung's photo) 

1505
01:00:02,154 --> 01:00:03,654
Sikyung is actually handsome. 

1506
01:00:04,121 --> 01:00:05,788
It looks like your album cover. 

1507
01:00:05,788 --> 01:00:07,954
You should use it for your new album. 

1508
01:00:08,754 --> 01:00:10,521
- Sure. / - For your new album. 

1509
01:00:10,521 --> 01:00:11,621
Okay. 

1510
01:00:14,154 --> 01:00:16,654
If you come to Burano, 

1511
01:00:16,654 --> 01:00:19,388
you should take photos with your lovers. 

1512
01:00:21,121 --> 01:00:22,688
We didn't drink but we feel drunk. 

1513
01:00:22,688 --> 01:00:23,854
- Shall we go? / - Let's go. 

1514
01:00:24,521 --> 01:00:26,121
This will make you fall in love. 

1515
01:00:27,154 --> 01:00:29,188
(It must be a dream) 

1516
01:00:29,588 --> 01:00:30,788
(Italy Gourmet Tour) 

1517
01:00:30,788 --> 01:00:35,454
(One pizza per person) 

1518
01:00:35,454 --> 01:00:37,888
Everyone, you will be surprised. 

1519
01:00:37,888 --> 01:00:39,088
Is it different? 

1520
01:00:39,488 --> 01:00:41,321
It's so soft. 

1521
01:00:41,321 --> 01:00:42,454
It was delicious. 

1522
01:00:42,454 --> 01:00:44,854
It's savory and a little spicy. 

1523
01:00:44,854 --> 01:00:45,921
You'll be surprised. 

1524
01:00:46,854 --> 01:00:48,621
- It's hard to pick one. / - This is difficult. 

1525
01:00:48,621 --> 01:00:50,488
What is salame piccante? 

1526
01:00:50,488 --> 01:00:51,788
It's like chorizo. 

1527
01:00:51,788 --> 01:00:52,921
Salame has just peppers in it 

1528
01:00:52,921 --> 01:00:54,254
but piccante has paprika powder 

1529
01:00:54,254 --> 01:00:55,621
and chili peppers in it. 

1530
01:00:55,621 --> 01:00:57,588
Salami piccante is like spicy salami. 

1531
01:00:58,221 --> 01:01:00,288
Then I'll order diavola. 

1532
01:01:00,788 --> 01:01:02,988
Diavola and... 

1533
01:01:03,754 --> 01:01:07,121
An arugula salad. 

1534
01:01:07,121 --> 01:01:09,221
Contorni means a side dish. 

1535
01:01:09,221 --> 01:01:10,821
I'll have an arugula salad for a side dish. 

1536
01:01:10,821 --> 01:01:12,388
I'll eat it with the pizza. 

1537
01:01:12,388 --> 01:01:13,754
That'd be good. 

1538
01:01:13,754 --> 01:01:15,988
- It was the best choice. / - It was excellent. 

1539
01:01:17,354 --> 01:01:21,188
(They start making dough in the kitchen) 

1540
01:01:21,188 --> 01:01:23,254
That was just unbelievably delicious. 

1541
01:01:23,554 --> 01:01:24,754
(Spreading tomato sauce) 

1542
01:01:24,754 --> 01:01:27,088
It was good. Pizza is... 

1543
01:01:27,588 --> 01:01:28,754
Always good. 

1544
01:01:28,754 --> 01:01:30,321
(Putting on toppings) 

1545
01:01:30,321 --> 01:01:32,454
The pizza is quite big for one person. 

1546
01:01:32,888 --> 01:01:34,754
- But everyone does that. / - They eat a whole pizza. 

1547
01:01:36,288 --> 01:01:38,021
This is a cute glass. 

1548
01:01:38,021 --> 01:01:39,288
(They have some beer while waiting for the pizza) 

1549
01:01:39,288 --> 01:01:40,554
Cheers. 

1550
01:01:40,554 --> 01:01:41,654
It must be cool. 

1551
01:01:48,021 --> 01:01:49,588
The pizza is here. 

1552
01:01:49,588 --> 01:01:50,921
(The pizza is finally being served) 

1553
01:01:52,654 --> 01:01:54,488
I'm so hungry right now. 

1554
01:01:55,021 --> 01:01:56,554
That's right. 

1555
01:01:56,554 --> 01:01:59,821
(Pizza diavola) 

1556
01:01:59,821 --> 01:02:02,221
I'm telling you. You can eat it all. 

1557
01:02:02,221 --> 01:02:03,321
It's really good. 

1558
01:02:03,321 --> 01:02:05,821
I think we should change the ranking. 

1559
01:02:07,088 --> 01:02:08,388
(I want to try it) 

1560
01:02:08,988 --> 01:02:10,121
It's really good. 

1561
01:02:10,621 --> 01:02:12,588
- This is pizza quattro stagioni. / - Right. 

1562
01:02:12,588 --> 01:02:14,688

1563
01:02:17,454 --> 01:02:21,554
(Arugula salad, pizza diavola, pizza quattro stagioni) 

1564
01:02:22,654 --> 01:02:25,788
They don't cut the pizza before serving. See? 

1565
01:02:25,788 --> 01:02:27,488
I'm sorry but I'm going to be a tourist for a bit. 

1566
01:02:29,588 --> 01:02:30,788
I should take pictures too. 

1567
01:02:32,554 --> 01:02:33,688
I'll take a picture of you, honey. 

1568
01:02:34,588 --> 01:02:36,954
(Acting natural) 

1569
01:02:36,954 --> 01:02:38,054
Cheese. 

1570
01:02:38,054 --> 01:02:39,688
Say I love you as I count to three. 

1571
01:02:42,754 --> 01:02:43,854
Say I love you. 

1572
01:02:43,854 --> 01:02:45,088
(Do we have to do this?) 

1573
01:02:45,088 --> 01:02:46,321
I love you... 

1574
01:02:46,321 --> 01:02:47,454
It's done. 

1575
01:02:47,954 --> 01:02:51,521
(A pizza place full of love) 

1576
01:02:52,554 --> 01:02:54,254
(They will try pizza diavola first) 

1577
01:02:54,254 --> 01:02:55,554
It looks great. 

1578
01:02:56,721 --> 01:02:57,821
Alright. 

1579
01:02:59,821 --> 01:03:00,954
I'll put this on the pizza. 

1580
01:03:00,954 --> 01:03:02,488
It was perfect. 

1581
01:03:02,488 --> 01:03:04,854
You should add a lot of arugula. 

1582
01:03:09,221 --> 01:03:10,788
(This is torture) 

1583
01:03:10,788 --> 01:03:13,121
(It's Sikyung's arugula pizza) 

1584
01:03:13,121 --> 01:03:15,154
The true taste of the Mediterranean countries 

1585
01:03:15,154 --> 01:03:16,388
is olive oil. 

1586
01:03:17,354 --> 01:03:18,554
I should drizzle it like this. 

1587
01:03:20,854 --> 01:03:23,654
(Most of the provinces in Italy produce olive oil) 

1588
01:03:23,654 --> 01:03:24,488
That's true. 

1589
01:03:24,488 --> 01:03:28,088
- Even on pizza? / - Drizzle a heap and it's still okay. 

1590
01:03:28,088 --> 01:03:29,054
That's unbelievable. 

1591
01:03:29,054 --> 01:03:32,354
(He adds olive oil on the arugula pizza) 

1592
01:03:35,454 --> 01:03:37,454
That must be really good. 

1593
01:03:39,221 --> 01:03:41,721
- That looks good. / - Hey, it's good. 

1594
01:03:42,721 --> 01:03:45,688
If you're going to eat an Italian-style pizza, 

1595
01:03:45,688 --> 01:03:48,121
you have to add olive oil on it to enjoy it properly. 

1596
01:03:48,121 --> 01:03:49,454
You have to add arugula 

1597
01:03:49,454 --> 01:03:51,221
as a topping while adding olive oil. 

1598
01:03:51,921 --> 01:03:54,554
- It looks so good. / - It's making me salivate. 

1599
01:03:54,554 --> 01:03:56,754
You should really try that when you go there. 

1600
01:03:57,221 --> 01:03:59,254
It's my wish. You should really try it. 

1601
01:04:10,254 --> 01:04:13,921
I can't stand it. I can't stand it. 

1602
01:04:14,554 --> 01:04:16,688
- My mouth is watering. / - I'm in trouble. 

1603
01:04:16,688 --> 01:04:17,688
Pizza diavola. 

1604
01:04:17,688 --> 01:04:19,888
The dough is so delicious. 

1605
01:04:20,254 --> 01:04:22,054
The dough is nice. 

1606
01:04:22,421 --> 01:04:25,354
I know that the origin of the word "pizza" 

1607
01:04:25,354 --> 01:04:28,121
comes from "pitta," a type of flatbread. 

1608
01:04:28,554 --> 01:04:30,588
It means that the main part of pizza is the dough, 

1609
01:04:30,588 --> 01:04:32,654
not the topping. 

1610
01:04:32,654 --> 01:04:33,954
When you see the dough, 

1611
01:04:33,954 --> 01:04:35,754
it has all the conditions to taste good. 

1612
01:04:35,754 --> 01:04:39,154
The flour itself is good but when they make the dough, 

1613
01:04:39,154 --> 01:04:41,588
they knead it with olive oil. 

1614
01:04:41,588 --> 01:04:43,021
- Yes. / - So it puffs when it bakes. 

1615
01:04:43,021 --> 01:04:44,788
Yes, it becomes like that when it bakes. 

1616
01:04:44,788 --> 01:04:46,121
(Surprise) 

1617
01:04:46,488 --> 01:04:48,288
Chef Lee Wonil would eat like this, right? 

1618
01:04:48,288 --> 01:04:49,588
(He burst into laughter) 

1619
01:04:50,388 --> 01:04:53,454
(Shocking) 

1620
01:04:53,454 --> 01:04:54,688
I'm imitating Lee Wonil. 

1621
01:04:57,388 --> 01:04:58,588
Cross! 

1622
01:04:58,588 --> 01:05:00,988
(The cross between Sikyung and Wonil) 

1623
01:05:00,988 --> 01:05:02,221
It's nice to have a married man with me. 

1624
01:05:02,221 --> 01:05:03,521
I'm just happy. 

1625
01:05:03,521 --> 01:05:04,854
(They eat and eat again) 

1626
01:05:04,854 --> 01:05:06,121
It's so good. 

1627
01:05:06,421 --> 01:05:07,621
It really is. 

1628
01:05:08,921 --> 01:05:11,388
They're not talking and they're just continuing to eat. 

1629
01:05:12,788 --> 01:05:13,921
We couldn't help it. 

1630
01:05:15,721 --> 01:05:17,621
(This team won't be easy to beat) 

1631
01:05:17,621 --> 01:05:20,088
Our date ended. 

1632
01:05:20,088 --> 01:05:21,521
So we will go back. 

1633
01:05:21,521 --> 01:05:23,954
(Italy Gourmet Tour, Venetian feast) 

1634
01:05:23,954 --> 01:05:26,188
(An hour water bus ride to Rialto Bridge) 

1635
01:05:26,188 --> 01:05:27,421
Are we coming here again? 

1636
01:05:29,421 --> 01:05:30,621
You must have really gone there for the food. 

1637
01:05:30,621 --> 01:05:33,288
Weren't you interested in glass art at all? 

1638
01:05:33,288 --> 01:05:34,788
You can't eat glass. 

1639
01:05:36,788 --> 01:05:39,121
You should include shopping and sight-seeing 

1640
01:05:39,121 --> 01:05:40,421
as you see fit. 

1641
01:05:40,421 --> 01:05:42,288
We're only showing you the food. 

1642
01:05:42,288 --> 01:05:43,754
- We're gourmet guides. / - Yes. 

1643
01:05:46,988 --> 01:05:54,188
(Another peaceful afternoon in Venice) 

1644
01:05:55,988 --> 01:05:57,754
We came back near... 

1645
01:05:57,754 --> 01:06:00,021
- The Rialto Bridge again. / - Yes. 

1646
01:06:00,021 --> 01:06:01,721
Can you see the Rialto Bridge there? 

1647
01:06:02,354 --> 01:06:03,521
There are a lot of people. 

1648
01:06:03,521 --> 01:06:05,688
- Next... / - Let's go eat pasta. 

1649
01:06:05,988 --> 01:06:07,454
Pasta and... 

1650
01:06:07,854 --> 01:06:09,488
Seafood. 

1651
01:06:10,254 --> 01:06:12,121
- Frutti di mare. / - That's right. 

1652
01:06:12,121 --> 01:06:13,288
What is frutti? 

1653
01:06:13,288 --> 01:06:15,788
- It's fruit. / - Fruit? 

1654
01:06:15,788 --> 01:06:17,288
They call it the "fruit of the sea." 

1655
01:06:18,021 --> 01:06:19,188
You said it was near here, right? 

1656
01:06:19,188 --> 01:06:22,288
There's a restaurant if you walk 5 minutes in the alley. 

1657
01:06:22,288 --> 01:06:23,754
Ask the driver to leave you at the Rialto Bridge. 

1658
01:06:23,754 --> 01:06:24,854
That's right. 

1659
01:06:25,921 --> 01:06:28,221
Wow. What is the name of this place? 

1660
01:06:29,254 --> 01:06:32,221
(It seems that something is hidden in this path) 

1661
01:06:32,221 --> 01:06:33,854
Don't you think you can start smelling seafood? 

1662
01:06:33,854 --> 01:06:35,554
I can smell something delicious. 

1663
01:06:37,121 --> 01:06:38,921
It's a small piazza. 

1664
01:06:38,921 --> 01:06:40,154
I didn't know that there was a place like this. 

1665
01:06:40,154 --> 01:06:42,021
This place feels like it has good food. 

1666
01:06:42,421 --> 01:06:44,454
- Is this the place from the photo? / - It is. 

1667
01:06:44,921 --> 01:06:46,221
This is amazing. 

1668
01:06:46,988 --> 01:06:48,621
This is my favorite place after coming here. 

1669
01:06:49,021 --> 01:06:51,021
This has a nice vibe. 

1670
01:06:51,021 --> 01:06:53,621
After Joonwoo ate... 

1671
01:06:54,188 --> 01:06:56,388
He told the chef that he respected him. 

1672
01:06:56,388 --> 01:06:57,421
(After the meal, he greeted the chef with respect) 

1673
01:06:57,421 --> 01:06:58,788
He told the chef that he really enjoyed the meal. 

1674
01:06:58,788 --> 01:07:01,321
The chef was a very old man. 

1675
01:07:01,921 --> 01:07:06,121
It was so moving and meaningful... 

1676
01:07:06,421 --> 01:07:07,854
To eat food made by someone like him. 

1677
01:07:08,688 --> 01:07:10,954
- Isn't this monkfish? / - Yes, it's monkfish. 

1678
01:07:10,954 --> 01:07:12,621
- They also have monkfish. / - Yes. 

1679
01:07:13,088 --> 01:07:16,121
Are these king crabs? They also have them. 

1680
01:07:16,121 --> 01:07:18,621
- I think it will be good, let's go. / - Looks amazing. 

1681
01:07:20,388 --> 01:07:21,788
Oh, my. 

1682
01:07:21,788 --> 01:07:22,888
(They have fresh fish) 

1683
01:07:22,888 --> 01:07:24,321
Look at how taut the flesh is. 

1684
01:07:24,321 --> 01:07:25,921
Is that monkfish? 

1685
01:07:27,254 --> 01:07:28,788
I didn't eat it back then. 

1686
01:07:30,521 --> 01:07:32,688
This place was really good. 

1687
01:07:32,688 --> 01:07:36,821
(Beautiful and aromatic Venetian gourmet) 

1688
01:07:38,188 --> 01:07:42,088
This restaurant specializes in seafood. 

1689
01:07:42,088 --> 01:07:43,788
They put fresh seafood that 

1690
01:07:43,788 --> 01:07:46,054
just came in on display right away. 

1691
01:07:46,054 --> 01:07:48,088
When customers order, they give it to them. 

1692
01:07:48,488 --> 01:07:50,288
The fish came in yesterday. 

1693
01:07:50,588 --> 01:07:53,054
They also have Korean on the menu. 

1694
01:07:53,054 --> 01:07:54,154
Look here. 

1695
01:07:54,754 --> 01:07:55,821
They have a Korean menu. 

1696
01:07:55,821 --> 01:07:58,488
- Why? / - They did a good job translating. 

1697
01:07:58,854 --> 01:08:00,354
Please pick the dishes for us. 

1698
01:08:00,354 --> 01:08:01,654
- Okay. / - Mister expert. 

1699
01:08:01,654 --> 01:08:03,221
We have to order fish from here. 

1700
01:08:04,088 --> 01:08:06,654
They have grilled fish and fish with sauce. 

1701
01:08:06,654 --> 01:08:08,621
- What do you like? / - They had monkfish. 

1702
01:08:08,621 --> 01:08:10,254
- I want to eat monkfish. / - Monkfish is delicious. 

1703
01:08:10,254 --> 01:08:12,088
- Monkfish and... / - Okay then. 

1704
01:08:12,088 --> 01:08:14,588
Do you know that they eat liver dishes here? 

1705
01:08:14,588 --> 01:08:16,654
- I like livers. / - They have... 

1706
01:08:16,654 --> 01:08:18,621
- A Venetian liver dish. / - I have a bad liver. 

1707
01:08:18,621 --> 01:08:20,954
- That's so nice. / - A very oriental medicine approach. 

1708
01:08:20,954 --> 01:08:22,954
- Let's order a liver dish then. / - The liver dish. 

1709
01:08:25,054 --> 01:08:27,088
(Caprese salad) 

1710
01:08:29,854 --> 01:08:31,954
- I also want to eat that. / - Vongole. 

1711
01:08:33,821 --> 01:08:35,088
- Oh, my. / - Gosh. 

1712
01:08:36,021 --> 01:08:37,621
- That looks good. / - That's liver? 

1713
01:08:38,621 --> 01:08:40,021
(Roasted monkfish) 

1714
01:08:40,021 --> 01:08:42,388
It's monkfish! 

1715
01:08:42,388 --> 01:08:43,854
This is amazing. 

1716
01:08:43,854 --> 01:08:45,488
(You can't leave out wine) 

1717
01:08:46,421 --> 01:08:48,621
Let's celebrate our special trip. 

1718
01:08:51,388 --> 01:08:52,854
We should drink it all at once. 

1719
01:08:55,654 --> 01:08:57,221
There's almost no sweetness. 

1720
01:08:57,221 --> 01:08:58,921
I thought you would like it since you like sourness. 

1721
01:08:59,254 --> 01:09:00,888
I think it will taste better if it was a little bit colder. 

1722
01:09:02,988 --> 01:09:04,288
- It's not bad. / - You're right. 

1723
01:09:04,688 --> 01:09:06,521
I'm really worried. 

1724
01:09:06,521 --> 01:09:07,521
What are you worried about? 

1725
01:09:07,521 --> 01:09:11,854
(What is Sikyung worried about?) 

1726
01:09:11,854 --> 01:09:13,721
- What are you worried about? / - I might fall in love. 

1727
01:09:14,254 --> 01:09:15,988
(What is wrong with him?) 

1728
01:09:15,988 --> 01:09:18,521
It seems that Sikyung is really lonely these days. 

1729
01:09:22,154 --> 01:09:24,054
There isn't anything wrong with me. 

1730
01:09:24,054 --> 01:09:25,788
I think that Venice is just a city like that. 

1731
01:09:26,554 --> 01:09:28,888
(The appetizer came at the right timing) 

1732
01:09:29,354 --> 01:09:30,688
(Salad made with mozzarella cheese and tomatoes) 

1733
01:09:30,688 --> 01:09:31,788
- It's so cute. / - Oh, my. 

1734
01:09:31,788 --> 01:09:33,721
They made it look like a doll. 

1735
01:09:33,721 --> 01:09:36,854
The mozzarella cheese was amazing. 

1736
01:09:36,854 --> 01:09:38,688
- Korea also has it. / - Shouldn't we also try it? 

1737
01:09:39,188 --> 01:09:40,921
But it's too expensive. 

1738
01:09:40,921 --> 01:09:42,454
(Joonwoo tries just the cheese first) 

1739
01:09:43,154 --> 01:09:44,488
The mozzarella is delicious. 

1740
01:09:44,488 --> 01:09:47,188
It's mozzarella that you can eat in Italy. 

1741
01:09:47,188 --> 01:09:48,854
It's really fresh. 

1742
01:09:48,854 --> 01:09:50,588
- It's really good. / - It looks really good. 

1743
01:09:50,588 --> 01:09:53,488
- It looks really good. / - It smells like milk. 

1744
01:09:53,921 --> 01:09:56,688
I always thought that mozzarella 

1745
01:09:56,688 --> 01:09:58,321
should have a soft texture like this. 

1746
01:09:58,321 --> 01:09:59,788
It's really delicious mozzarella. 

1747
01:10:00,121 --> 01:10:01,621
- It looks so good. / - It looks so good. 

1748
01:10:01,954 --> 01:10:03,888
- It's good. / - I think that probably... 

1749
01:10:03,888 --> 01:10:05,621
The tomatoes will also taste good. 

1750
01:10:05,621 --> 01:10:06,854
(He tastes just the tomatoes this time) 

1751
01:10:11,721 --> 01:10:13,321
The olives should be salty to taste good. 

1752
01:10:13,321 --> 01:10:14,788
This is why. 

1753
01:10:14,788 --> 01:10:17,054
Aren't the cheese and tomatoes a little bland? 

1754
01:10:17,054 --> 01:10:20,488
They go perfectly with olives than salt. 

1755
01:10:21,121 --> 01:10:22,488
My gosh. 

1756
01:10:22,488 --> 01:10:23,821
This tastes good. 

1757
01:10:24,288 --> 01:10:26,321
- He makes it look so good. / - I know. 

1758
01:10:26,321 --> 01:10:28,054
Isn't the arugula good too? The aroma is strong. 

1759
01:10:28,488 --> 01:10:30,921
Yes. The arugula is a little like wasabi. 

1760
01:10:31,354 --> 01:10:32,821
It tastes a little sharp. 

1761
01:10:32,821 --> 01:10:34,221
The air is so clean, 

1762
01:10:34,221 --> 01:10:35,988
they have an amazing amount of sunshine. 

1763
01:10:36,521 --> 01:10:38,488
The taste of the vegetables 

1764
01:10:38,488 --> 01:10:40,354
and tomatoes is different. 

1765
01:10:42,254 --> 01:10:43,421
- Here's the spaghetti alle vongole. / - Gosh. 

1766
01:10:43,421 --> 01:10:45,654
(The spaghetti alle vongole came) 

1767
01:10:45,654 --> 01:10:47,754
I forgot to ask for more spaghetti pasta. 

1768
01:10:47,754 --> 01:10:50,254
(He's upset because there's only a small amount) 

1769
01:10:51,721 --> 01:10:53,121
- That looks good. / - Gosh. 

1770
01:10:53,121 --> 01:10:54,321
That was really amazing. 

1771
01:10:54,821 --> 01:10:57,188
- What is that? / - It's spaghetti alle vongole. 

1772
01:10:57,188 --> 01:11:00,121
- It looks so good. / - It's the dish we know. 

1773
01:11:00,788 --> 01:11:02,721
- But it was really well made. / - Gosh. 

1774
01:11:02,721 --> 01:11:04,421
- That looks good. / - I'm hungry. 

1775
01:11:04,421 --> 01:11:07,488
The spaghetti was dry but they cooked it so well. 

1776
01:11:07,488 --> 01:11:09,254
- Look. / - It was so well mixed with... 

1777
01:11:09,254 --> 01:11:12,188
The spaghetti water, olive oil and clam stock. 

1778
01:11:12,188 --> 01:11:12,821
It was the best. 

1779
01:11:13,788 --> 01:11:14,988
Please... 

1780
01:11:16,188 --> 01:11:17,454
Okay? 

1781
01:11:21,221 --> 01:11:24,321
Before I chewed this, the pasta touched my tongue 

1782
01:11:24,321 --> 01:11:25,621
and I realized right away that it was delicious. 

1783
01:11:25,621 --> 01:11:26,954
It's good. 

1784
01:11:28,388 --> 01:11:31,088
This is the al dente we talk about. 

1785
01:11:31,421 --> 01:11:33,888
The spaghetti is dry, so the core inside is still raw. 

1786
01:11:33,888 --> 01:11:36,021
It's very firm as I chew it. 

1787
01:11:36,021 --> 01:11:37,854
It has great texture. 

1788
01:11:41,154 --> 01:11:42,421
- The clams are nice too. / - Yeah? 

1789
01:11:42,421 --> 01:11:44,888
(The clams are also delicious) 

1790
01:11:46,721 --> 01:11:48,854
I can eat 5 plates of that. 

1791
01:11:49,721 --> 01:11:51,021
I can eat that much. 

1792
01:11:51,554 --> 01:11:54,954
But why am I so happy watching the Italian trip? 

1793
01:11:54,954 --> 01:11:56,288
- I don't know. / - Yes? 

1794
01:11:56,288 --> 01:11:58,854
Hwijae, you look a little nervous. 

1795
01:11:58,854 --> 01:12:03,154
It's not that. Food is surely amazing in Italy. 

1796
01:12:06,921 --> 01:12:09,188
This will be a little salty for Koreans. 

1797
01:12:09,188 --> 01:12:11,154
It tastes like eating a handful of seasonings. 

1798
01:12:11,154 --> 01:12:12,854
But it's good for your health. 

1799
01:12:12,854 --> 01:12:14,154
- It's not bad for your health. / - You're right. 

1800
01:12:14,154 --> 01:12:16,554
It's really salty but it makes you feel really good. 

1801
01:12:17,088 --> 01:12:19,088
It is very savory and delicious. 

1802
01:12:19,721 --> 01:12:22,254
- You can't stop eating. / - My hands keep reaching. 

1803
01:12:27,488 --> 01:12:28,888
It's really good. 

1804
01:12:28,888 --> 01:12:30,121
(It's clean) 

1805
01:12:30,721 --> 01:12:32,554
I was doing a good job on my diet. 

1806
01:12:32,954 --> 01:12:34,721
I'll have to go on a diet now. 

1807
01:12:34,721 --> 01:12:36,421
You have to eat the bread with the remaining sauce. 

1808
01:12:37,021 --> 01:12:39,088
Hongseok, are you drooling? 

1809
01:12:39,088 --> 01:12:41,354
- Hongseok, are you drooling? / - I'm going crazy. 

1810
01:12:41,354 --> 01:12:42,988
(He's almost losing it) 

1811
01:12:43,888 --> 01:12:48,854
(The next dish is the Venetian liver dish) 

1812
01:12:48,854 --> 01:12:50,354
You have to try that. 

1813
01:12:50,354 --> 01:12:53,121
You can't deliver the taste of the liver from the screen. 

1814
01:12:53,121 --> 01:12:55,088
- That's right. / - Look at that side. 

1815
01:12:55,088 --> 01:12:57,721
(Venetian liver dish, Fegato alla veneziana, $24.70) 

1816
01:12:58,721 --> 01:12:59,754
(It's a powerful feeling) 

1817
01:12:59,754 --> 01:13:01,088
- What is this? / - It smells good. 

1818
01:13:01,088 --> 01:13:03,254
(The feeling of gourmet) 

1819
01:13:03,254 --> 01:13:04,721
I think it will even taste good. 

1820
01:13:04,721 --> 01:13:09,654
(If you take a piece in your mouth, you'll be surprised) 

1821
01:13:09,654 --> 01:13:13,921
(You're watching Sikyung's reaction after eating liver) 

1822
01:13:13,921 --> 01:13:15,521
Is it good? 

1823
01:13:15,521 --> 01:13:16,554
It must be very soft. 

1824
01:13:16,554 --> 01:13:18,021
- It's melting. / - Is the liver good? 

1825
01:13:18,021 --> 01:13:19,054
In my view, 

1826
01:13:19,054 --> 01:13:20,488
they fried it in a high heat with... 

1827
01:13:20,488 --> 01:13:23,354
- Onions for a long time. / - The onion is delicious. 

1828
01:13:23,354 --> 01:13:24,921
To extract the most sweetness. 

1829
01:13:26,988 --> 01:13:28,821
This is the best dish here. 

1830
01:13:28,821 --> 01:13:31,488
- The sweetness of the onions. / - Sweet onions... 

1831
01:13:31,488 --> 01:13:33,854
- It's like foie gras jam on top. / - You're right. 

1832
01:13:33,854 --> 01:13:35,621
- Is it really good? / - It was the best dish for me. 

1833
01:13:35,621 --> 01:13:39,054
They put a little cream in it, so it was so savory. 

1834
01:13:39,054 --> 01:13:40,454
It must taste really smooth. 

1835
01:13:41,154 --> 01:13:43,221
I never tried anything like that before. 

1836
01:13:43,754 --> 01:13:44,754
Cheers. 

1837
01:13:44,754 --> 01:13:48,154
(They share this moving moment with wine) 

1838
01:13:48,154 --> 01:13:49,654
(He's surprised) 

1839
01:13:50,154 --> 01:13:52,721
There are 3 places that make the best wines in Italy. 

1840
01:13:52,721 --> 01:13:55,754
They are Piedmont, Tuscany and Veneto. 

1841
01:13:56,521 --> 01:13:59,054
This is one of the most famous wines from Veneto. 

1842
01:13:59,421 --> 01:14:01,388
It will be nice to have this when you're here. 

1843
01:14:01,388 --> 01:14:03,721
It costs about 30 euros. You have to drink it with this. 

1844
01:14:03,721 --> 01:14:04,888
When you chew on this, 

1845
01:14:04,888 --> 01:14:06,621
you should drink the wine before it disappears. 

1846
01:14:06,621 --> 01:14:08,688
You will feel it strongly in your nose. 

1847
01:14:09,321 --> 01:14:10,988
(The next dish to continue the moving moment) 

1848
01:14:10,988 --> 01:14:12,821

01:14:30,154 --> 01:14:32,021

1854
01:14:33,388 --> 01:14:35,954
- They dismantle it for you. / - I see. 

1855
01:14:35,954 --> 01:14:38,421
I want to suck on that bone. Hope they don't clear it. 

1856
01:14:38,721 --> 01:14:40,854
(The flesh on the bone is the most delicious part) 

1857
01:14:40,854 --> 01:14:42,221
It looks good. 

1858
01:14:46,321 --> 01:14:47,154

- How is it? / - It's good. 

1864
01:15:04,188 --> 01:15:05,354
If you chew the flesh, 

1865
01:15:05,354 --> 01:15:08,388
the sweetness of the fish sticks to your tongue. 

1866
01:15:08,388 --> 01:15:11,954
That's a live fish. Live monkfish is really amazing. 

1867
01:15:11,954 --> 01:15:13,421
This is powerful. 

1868

Monkfish! Where is the monkfish? 

1875
01:15:25,554 --> 01:15:27,854
You should come here. If you come to Venice... 

1876
01:15:28,854 --> 01:15:30,688
You should come here on the first day 

1877
01:15:30,688 --> 01:15:32,188

Will we eat less in Bologna? That's not true.

Wow, this is the best. 

1892

Thank you for the food. 

1894

01:16:26,154 --> 01:16:27,421
In the end, 

1903
01:16:27,421 --> 01:16:28,354
everything fell apart. 

1904
01:16:28,354 --> 01:16:30,688
I added these on top. 

1905
01:16:30,688 --> 01:16:33,054
This is like celestial world. 

1906
01:16:33,054 --> 01:16:34,988
- The celestial world? / - I never encountered... 

1907
01:16:34,988 --> 01:16:37,154
Monkfish and the liver. 

1908
01:16:37,154 --> 01:16:39,688
I thought that I should eat it at least once before I die. 

1909
01:16:39,688 --> 01:16:42,688
We want to try the monkfish. 

1910
01:16:42,688 --> 01:16:44,854
- The monkfish is nice. / - Yes. 

1911
01:16:45,254 --> 01:16:46,288
What about Lovelyz? 

1912
01:16:46,588 --> 01:16:48,788
We also want to try the monkfish. 

1913
01:16:49,154 --> 01:16:53,221
The flesh looked so firm when they cooked it. 

1914
01:16:53,221 --> 01:16:54,454
Yes, just like that. 

1915
01:16:54,854 --> 01:16:55,921
It looks like this when you turn it over. 

1916
01:16:55,921 --> 01:16:57,354
Yes. 

1917
01:16:57,354 --> 01:16:58,588
(Sikyung is describing the monkfish flesh in detail) 

1918
01:16:58,588 --> 01:17:01,021
- That's a perfect expression. / - That's it. 

1919
01:17:01,021 --> 01:17:04,821
Both teams chose the monkfish as 1st place. 

1920
01:17:05,221 --> 01:17:06,454
Including me. 

1921
01:17:06,454 --> 01:17:08,254
What is the first place inside your heart? 

1922
01:17:08,254 --> 01:17:09,854
I also choose... 

1923
01:17:11,021 --> 01:17:12,754
(I also choose the monkfish) 

1924
01:17:15,588 --> 01:17:18,254
Since today is a gourmet special, 

1925
01:17:18,254 --> 01:17:19,688
they traveled to Venice, Italy. 

1926
01:17:19,688 --> 01:17:22,554
They made the most of it. 

1927
01:17:22,554 --> 01:17:25,554
We will reveal the food expenses, 

1928
01:17:25,554 --> 01:17:27,421
not the total expenses today. 

1929
01:17:28,554 --> 01:17:31,121
Did you receive the bill? 

1930
01:17:31,121 --> 01:17:33,388
- Hongseok? / - Yes, I have the bill right now. 

1931
01:17:33,388 --> 01:17:34,788
- Really? / - Yes. 

1932
01:17:34,788 --> 01:17:36,554
- It's expensive, right? / - It seems expensive. 

1933
01:17:36,554 --> 01:17:38,454
But the dishes are too high quality. 

1934
01:17:38,454 --> 01:17:40,888
Yes. They ate too expensively. 

1935
01:17:40,888 --> 01:17:43,988
For 2 nights and 3 days in Venice, Italy, 

1936
01:17:43,988 --> 01:17:46,688
the total expense for 6 meals is... 

1937
01:17:46,688 --> 01:17:48,588
- Per person? / - Yes, per person. 

1938
01:17:48,588 --> 01:17:50,421
- 2... / - Is it $2,000? 

1939
01:17:50,421 --> 01:17:52,521
(Did they really spend $2,000 for 6 meals?) 

1940
01:17:52,521 --> 01:17:54,754
(What will be the result?) 

1941
01:17:54,754 --> 01:17:56,388
- 2... / - Is it $2,000? 

1942
01:17:56,754 --> 01:17:58,821
- $200... / - $200? 

1943
01:17:58,821 --> 01:18:01,321
- $204. / - $204! 

1944
01:18:01,321 --> 01:18:03,921
- We even drank wine. / - Do you know why? 

1945
01:18:03,921 --> 01:18:05,888
- How could this happen? / - It's because wine is cheap. 

1946
01:18:06,354 --> 01:18:07,821
If we ate this in Korea... 

1947
01:18:08,121 --> 01:18:09,021
It'd be $2,000. 

1948
01:18:09,021 --> 01:18:11,754
- It would be over $2,000. / - It would be about $2,000. 

1949
01:18:11,754 --> 01:18:13,988
I'd like to request this to people. 

1950
01:18:13,988 --> 01:18:15,121
I'm not saying you should drink enough to get drunk. 

1951
01:18:15,121 --> 01:18:16,754
But you shouldn't leave wine out. 

1952
01:18:16,754 --> 01:18:20,554
The liver dish and a sip of red wine are a set. 

1953
01:18:20,554 --> 01:18:22,354
It's meaningless if you just eat the liver dish. 

1954
01:18:22,888 --> 01:18:23,888
- That's right. / - Okay. 

1955
01:18:23,888 --> 01:18:26,421
The Battle Trip hosts went on a gourmet trip. 

1956
01:18:26,421 --> 01:18:29,988
We are planning to reveal the evaluation form, 

1957
01:18:29,988 --> 01:18:31,988
restaurant locations and information 

1958
01:18:31,988 --> 01:18:33,054
on the website later. 

1959
01:18:33,054 --> 01:18:36,621
We saw We Will Eat Tour's trip to Venice, Italy. 

1960
01:18:36,621 --> 01:18:38,388
Next week, we will go 

1961
01:18:38,388 --> 01:18:39,788
on a gourmet trip to Barcelona, Spain. 

1962
01:18:39,788 --> 01:18:41,254
(Next episode) 

1963
01:18:41,321 --> 01:18:45,388
We've arrived at Catalonia Square! 

1964
01:18:45,988 --> 01:18:48,454
True gourmands choose Spain. 

1965
01:18:48,954 --> 01:18:50,454
The ingredients are so good. 

1966
01:18:50,454 --> 01:18:52,388
The aromas are really unique. 

1967
01:18:52,388 --> 01:18:53,954
It's so soft and chewy. 

1968
01:18:53,954 --> 01:18:54,921
It's so savory. 

1969
01:18:56,821 --> 01:18:59,188
It's called the kitchen of Europe. 

1970
01:18:59,188 --> 01:19:01,654
They have the best foods in this market. 

1971
01:19:02,621 --> 01:19:04,254
This is so delicious. 

1972
01:19:04,254 --> 01:19:06,121
You have to see Flamenco. 

1973
01:19:06,721 --> 01:19:08,754
(You must see Flamenco) 

1974
01:19:08,754 --> 01:19:11,154
Barcelona is the Mecca for food enthusiasts. 

1975
01:19:11,154 --> 01:19:12,321
Barcelona... 

1976
01:19:12,321 --> 01:19:13,688
- Adios! / - Adios! 

1977
01:19:13,688 --> 01:19:16,790
(Battle Trip) 

1978
01:19:16,790 --> 01:19:34,767
