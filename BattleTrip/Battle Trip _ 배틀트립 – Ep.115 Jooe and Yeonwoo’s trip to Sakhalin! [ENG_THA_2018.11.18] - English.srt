1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,208
We have finally arrived in Bandung. 

2
00:00:03,208 --> 00:00:04,374
Follow, follow me. 

3
00:00:05,074 --> 00:00:06,608
It's simply amazing. 

4
00:00:06,608 --> 00:00:07,941
My prince. 

5
00:00:07,941 --> 00:00:09,341
This is just what I like. 

6
00:00:09,741 --> 00:00:11,508
So pretty. 

7
00:00:13,708 --> 00:00:15,508
It's so awesome. 

8
00:00:15,508 --> 00:00:19,341
Everyone, have a Bandung day! 

9
00:00:19,341 --> 00:00:21,808
(Which team will win?) 

10
00:00:24,108 --> 00:00:27,074
(Numerous great tips on trips) 

11
00:00:28,608 --> 00:00:29,441
(Lee Suji, Song Daeun) 

12
00:00:30,174 --> 00:00:31,408
(Jooe and Yeonwoo of MOMOLAND) 

13
00:00:31,408 --> 00:00:32,408
Travel is war. 

14
00:00:32,408 --> 00:00:34,641
Battle Trip! 

15
00:00:35,941 --> 00:00:36,708
Continuing on from last week, 

16
00:00:36,708 --> 00:00:38,141
the theme is Hidden destinations 

17
00:00:38,141 --> 00:00:40,441
you must visit before everyone finds out about them. 

18
00:00:40,441 --> 00:00:42,074
We have our trip planners with us again. 

19
00:00:42,074 --> 00:00:43,508
- Welcome. / - It's nice to see the four of you. 

20
00:00:43,508 --> 00:00:45,074
- Hello. / - Hello. 

21
00:00:45,074 --> 00:00:47,674
We have our 100 impartial judges 

22
00:00:47,674 --> 00:00:49,608
who will vote on today's trips. 

23
00:00:49,608 --> 00:00:51,008
- Welcome. / - Welcome. 

24
00:00:52,108 --> 00:00:54,508
Actually, it was our first time to hear about Bandung. 

25
00:00:54,508 --> 00:00:56,508
- Bandung. / - Bandung, Indonesia. 

26
00:00:56,508 --> 00:00:59,308
I didn't expect much because it was unfamiliar. 

27
00:00:59,308 --> 00:01:00,741
But it was very fun and interesting. 

28
00:01:00,741 --> 00:01:02,508
- I really want to go there. / - Right. 

29
00:01:02,508 --> 00:01:04,308
If you visit our blog, you can find... 

30
00:01:04,308 --> 00:01:06,674
All the details and addresses there. 

31
00:01:06,674 --> 00:01:08,241
You can refer to it before going on your trip. 

32
00:01:08,574 --> 00:01:11,741
This is a battle between special hosts. 

33
00:01:11,741 --> 00:01:14,341
Suji and Jooe were here before. 

34
00:01:14,341 --> 00:01:17,074
I think that's why they could plan perfect trips. 

35
00:01:17,074 --> 00:01:19,541
So I was hoping to be here again 

36
00:01:19,541 --> 00:01:20,508
after winning today. 

37
00:01:20,508 --> 00:01:22,274
Where do you want to go? You have a kid. 

38
00:01:22,274 --> 00:01:23,974
- Sometimes, I need to leave home. / - Watch your kid. 

39
00:01:23,974 --> 00:01:25,374
That's not it. 

40
00:01:25,374 --> 00:01:26,741
Sometimes, we have a married couples battle. 

41
00:01:26,741 --> 00:01:28,608
- Married couples? / - You should do that. 

42
00:01:28,608 --> 00:01:29,908
Must I go with my wife? 

43
00:01:30,908 --> 00:01:31,674
I think it's a good idea. 

44
00:01:31,674 --> 00:01:32,741
That's how married men are. 

45
00:01:32,741 --> 00:01:34,374
I mean, I just want to go on a trip. 

46
00:01:34,374 --> 00:01:37,341
Anyway, today, we're going to places you should 

47
00:01:37,341 --> 00:01:38,908
visit before everyone finds out about them. 

48
00:01:38,908 --> 00:01:40,674
- And there are a lot of places. / - Yes. 

49
00:01:40,674 --> 00:01:42,674
There are a lot of destinations we don't know. 

50
00:01:42,674 --> 00:01:46,174
It's a little far but there are a lot of places in Africa. 

51
00:01:46,174 --> 00:01:47,908
- That's right. / - In Tanzania... 

52
00:01:47,908 --> 00:01:49,508
There's a place called Zanzibar. 

53
00:01:49,508 --> 00:01:53,308
It's the best vacation spot loved by European people. 

54
00:01:53,308 --> 00:01:54,441
Zanzibar in Tanzania. 

55
00:01:54,441 --> 00:01:55,874
I want to recommend one. 

56
00:01:55,874 --> 00:01:57,474
I heard rural areas of France are so nice. 

57
00:01:57,474 --> 00:01:58,974
- France. / - Right. 

58
00:01:58,974 --> 00:02:00,274
Not Paris. 

59
00:02:00,274 --> 00:02:02,041
If you go to the country, 

60
00:02:02,041 --> 00:02:03,774
there are good restaurants and wineries. 

61
00:02:03,774 --> 00:02:05,141
The people are really hospitable. 

62
00:02:05,141 --> 00:02:06,574
- They're hospitable. / - And much cheaper. 

63
00:02:06,574 --> 00:02:07,874
And they have... 

64
00:02:07,874 --> 00:02:10,008
- A tour around ancient castles. / - Right. 

65
00:02:10,341 --> 00:02:12,708
They're not famous castles 

66
00:02:12,708 --> 00:02:13,941
but you can sleep in there. 

67
00:02:13,941 --> 00:02:14,974
You can rent the whole castle. 

68
00:02:14,974 --> 00:02:17,141
Yes, and it's not so expensive. 

69
00:02:17,141 --> 00:02:19,708
But what about a trip to the equator? 

70
00:02:19,708 --> 00:02:21,141
- A trip to the equator? / - The equator? 

71
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:22,841
- In Ecuador... / - I really want to try it. 

72
00:02:22,841 --> 00:02:24,341
There's a city called Quito. 

73
00:02:24,341 --> 00:02:27,008
You can do some scientific experiments there. 

74
00:02:27,008 --> 00:02:28,741
- The egg. / - It's very interesting. 

75
00:02:29,608 --> 00:02:31,441
You can stand an egg on end of a nail. 

76
00:02:31,441 --> 00:02:32,841
You go all the way there just to balance an egg? 

77
00:02:33,341 --> 00:02:35,674
- It's just one of the experiments. / - I see. 

78
00:02:35,674 --> 00:02:37,474
You can experience many things there. 

79
00:02:37,474 --> 00:02:39,508
I heard there are so many interesting things. 

80
00:02:39,508 --> 00:02:41,441
Alright. Remember those places. 

81
00:02:41,441 --> 00:02:43,541
It's the hidden trip locations. 

82
00:02:43,541 --> 00:02:44,741
- You should visit. / - They're our opponents... 

83
00:02:44,741 --> 00:02:46,708
But I'm very curious about Sakhalin. 

84
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:47,974
- I'm so curious. / - It's because... 

85
00:02:47,974 --> 00:02:50,141
We have to talk about the history regarding Sakhalin. 

86
00:02:50,141 --> 00:02:51,974
We have the tragic history in Sakhalin. 

87
00:02:51,974 --> 00:02:53,708
There are people who couldn't come back home. 

88
00:02:53,708 --> 00:02:55,108
That's right. 

89
00:02:55,108 --> 00:02:57,941
When we went on a trip to Mokpo, 

90
00:02:57,941 --> 00:02:58,674
we learned this term. 

91
00:02:58,674 --> 00:03:00,941
- It's called dark tourism. / - Roh Chunghun said that. 

92
00:03:00,941 --> 00:03:02,674
It's traveling around 

93
00:03:02,674 --> 00:03:05,441
historic or disastrous sites. 

94
00:03:05,441 --> 00:03:08,274
A trip for fun is also good, 

95
00:03:08,274 --> 00:03:10,841
but it is also very meaningful 

96
00:03:10,841 --> 00:03:13,874
to go on a trip where you can learn and introspect. 

97
00:03:13,874 --> 00:03:15,174
- That's right. / - To be honest... 

98
00:03:15,174 --> 00:03:17,308
I didn't know much about the place either. 

99
00:03:17,308 --> 00:03:18,641
When we got there, 

100
00:03:18,641 --> 00:03:20,474
there was the Monument at the Mountain Pechali. 

101
00:03:20,474 --> 00:03:22,841
which was built in remembrance of the history. 

102
00:03:22,841 --> 00:03:25,208
We heard about the history 

103
00:03:25,208 --> 00:03:27,808
and had some time to think about it there. 

104
00:03:27,808 --> 00:03:29,741
- I could understand how they felt. / - It's so sad. 

105
00:03:29,741 --> 00:03:31,408
- Right. / - When we go to a place like that... 

106
00:03:31,408 --> 00:03:33,008
- We feel like crying. / - Right. 

107
00:03:33,008 --> 00:03:34,308
It felt strange. 

108
00:03:34,308 --> 00:03:35,741
- I know. / - It was weird. 

109
00:03:35,741 --> 00:03:39,108
There are second and third generation Koreans. 

110
00:03:39,108 --> 00:03:40,741
They speak a little Korean. 

111
00:03:40,741 --> 00:03:43,174
- Oh, that's true. / - I guess the food there is... 

112
00:03:43,174 --> 00:03:44,908
- Also sort of Korean. / - Right. 

113
00:03:44,908 --> 00:03:46,274
- Is that true? / - Yes. 

114
00:03:46,274 --> 00:03:49,341
It was like something I had for breakfast. 

115
00:03:49,341 --> 00:03:51,274
- It was like home cooked food. / - Really? 

116
00:03:51,274 --> 00:03:53,474
- Seriously? / - Home cooked food? 

117
00:03:53,474 --> 00:03:55,374
You can look forward to it. 

118
00:03:55,841 --> 00:03:58,074
Before we start, let's take a look at the map. 

119
00:03:58,074 --> 00:03:59,108
It's Sakhalin. 

120
00:03:59,108 --> 00:04:00,374
It's closer than Bandung. 

121
00:04:00,374 --> 00:04:01,808
- It's so close. / - It's close. 

122
00:04:01,808 --> 00:04:03,208
- How many hours? / - About 3 hours. 

123
00:04:03,208 --> 00:04:05,508
- 3 hours? / - Vladivostok was also very close. 

124
00:04:05,508 --> 00:04:07,174
- Is there a direct flight? / - Yes. 

125
00:04:07,174 --> 00:04:08,508
There are direct flights on Tuesdays, Thursdays, 

126
00:04:08,508 --> 00:04:09,208
Saturdays. 

127
00:04:09,208 --> 00:04:10,974
- There are? / - Three direct flights a week. 

128
00:04:12,308 --> 00:04:14,674
Sakhalin has a small population 

129
00:04:14,674 --> 00:04:15,608
for its large land mass. 

130
00:04:15,608 --> 00:04:19,308
- It is about 500,000. / - 500,000? 

131
00:04:19,308 --> 00:04:22,174
They mostly live in the center area... 

132
00:04:22,174 --> 00:04:24,008
- Called Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk. / - Okay. 

133
00:04:24,008 --> 00:04:26,708
All the restaurants and landmarks are not too far. 

134
00:04:26,708 --> 00:04:27,774
It was very convenient. 

135
00:04:27,774 --> 00:04:29,408
- I see. / - They are concentrated in there. 

136
00:04:29,408 --> 00:04:30,908
- It's a good thing. / - It has easy accessibility. 

137
00:04:30,908 --> 00:04:32,908
I heard a lot of Russian people... 

138
00:04:32,908 --> 00:04:35,141
- Go to Sakhalin for a trip. / - Right. 

139
00:04:35,141 --> 00:04:36,941
- There are a lot of reasons for it. / - Yes. 

140
00:04:36,941 --> 00:04:39,074
- But they mostly go skiing there. / - Skiing? 

141
00:04:39,074 --> 00:04:40,974
- Yes. / - They go skiing there. 

142
00:04:40,974 --> 00:04:42,374
- The quality of snow is good there. / - Right. 

143
00:04:42,374 --> 00:04:43,974
So national ski teams also go there for training. 

144
00:04:43,974 --> 00:04:46,008
- Really? / - To Sakhalin? 

145
00:04:46,008 --> 00:04:50,174
And the weather is relatively warm. 

146
00:04:50,174 --> 00:04:51,541
So many people visit there. 

147
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:52,708
There's one thing I'm worried about. 

148
00:04:52,708 --> 00:04:55,474
Crustaceans like lobster or king crab... 

149
00:04:55,474 --> 00:04:57,474
- Are very famous there. / - That's true. 

150
00:04:57,474 --> 00:04:59,974
When crustaceans and instant noodles are aired, 

151
00:04:59,974 --> 00:05:01,074
the viewer ratings soar. 

152
00:05:01,074 --> 00:05:02,708
Once we slurp the noodles, 

153
00:05:02,708 --> 00:05:03,741
the viewer ratings go up. 

154
00:05:04,374 --> 00:05:06,408
I hope it won't happen. 

155
00:05:07,008 --> 00:05:09,108
People who love fishing visit there as well? 

156
00:05:09,108 --> 00:05:11,274
I was so surprised to see that. 

157
00:05:11,274 --> 00:05:11,974
Did you go fishing? 

158
00:05:12,541 --> 00:05:14,474
You will see. 

159
00:05:14,474 --> 00:05:17,008
- Anyway... / - Where do you go fishing? 

160
00:05:17,008 --> 00:05:17,708
Out the sea. 

161
00:05:18,174 --> 00:05:22,074
- Out to sea? / - There's the Sea of Okhotsk. 

162
00:05:22,074 --> 00:05:23,708
You can actually go to the Sea of Okhotsk. 

163
00:05:24,108 --> 00:05:26,641
I'm worried about fishing though. 

164
00:05:26,641 --> 00:05:29,108
A lot of trip planners have tried fishing on Battle Trip. 

165
00:05:29,108 --> 00:05:30,541
But they rarely caught fish. 

166
00:05:31,641 --> 00:05:32,841
- But we... / - Wait. Don't tell. Don't tell. 

167
00:05:33,174 --> 00:05:34,374
- It's a secret. / - A secret? 

168
00:05:34,374 --> 00:05:35,908
What's your team name? 

169
00:05:35,908 --> 00:05:38,408
We came up with something cute. 

170
00:05:38,408 --> 00:05:40,508
- Cuter than ours? / - Sure. 

171
00:05:40,508 --> 00:05:41,608
Start. 

172
00:05:42,641 --> 00:05:44,441
(Cheerful and bubbly) 

173
00:05:45,574 --> 00:05:47,474
(They're the cutest ones) 

174
00:05:47,474 --> 00:05:49,341
Moa Moa Tour! 

175
00:05:49,341 --> 00:05:50,408
Let's watch it. 

176
00:05:51,508 --> 00:05:53,408
2, 3. Get your ticket! 

177
00:05:53,408 --> 00:05:55,608
Hello, we are MOMOLAND. 

178
00:05:55,608 --> 00:05:57,341
- I'm Jooe. / - And I'm Yeonwoo. 

179
00:05:57,341 --> 00:05:58,074
So fresh. 

180
00:05:58,074 --> 00:05:59,308
(MOMOLAND is on Battle Trip) 

181
00:06:00,841 --> 00:06:05,041
(Human vitamin, Jooe) 

182
00:06:06,541 --> 00:06:11,174
(Pretty jewel, Yeonwoo) 

183
00:06:12,274 --> 00:06:13,774
Have you been on a trip before? 

184
00:06:13,774 --> 00:06:14,841
Of course. 

185
00:06:14,841 --> 00:06:16,441
Unlike you, I have. 

186
00:06:17,708 --> 00:06:20,408
- A homebody. / - I love staying home. 

187
00:06:20,408 --> 00:06:22,008
It was the first time she got on a plane this year. 

188
00:06:22,008 --> 00:06:23,174
- Really? / - Yes. 

189
00:06:23,174 --> 00:06:25,008
- Because of work. / - She's 23 now. 

190
00:06:25,008 --> 00:06:26,974
Let's decide where to go first. 

191
00:06:26,974 --> 00:06:28,974
You should do it systematically. 

192
00:06:28,974 --> 00:06:30,374
I want to go to Russia. 

193
00:06:30,374 --> 00:06:32,641
- I've heard so much about it. / - Let's go then. 

194
00:06:32,641 --> 00:06:34,908
Really? You're very decisive. 

195
00:06:35,574 --> 00:06:36,974
- What should I put in? / - Russia. 

196
00:06:37,541 --> 00:06:38,541
Map. 

197
00:06:38,541 --> 00:06:40,508
Blagoveshchensk? 

198
00:06:40,508 --> 00:06:42,141
Khabarovsk. 

199
00:06:42,141 --> 00:06:44,341
- The names are so difficult. / - They are difficult. 

200
00:06:44,341 --> 00:06:46,074
Is this an island? 

201
00:06:46,074 --> 00:06:47,841
Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk? 

202
00:06:47,841 --> 00:06:49,474
It's too big to be an island. 

203
00:06:49,474 --> 00:06:51,274
- It's Sakhalin. / - Sakhalin? 

204
00:06:51,274 --> 00:06:53,508
I've heard of it before. 

205
00:06:54,274 --> 00:06:56,308
But it doesn't sound familiar. 

206
00:06:56,308 --> 00:06:58,141
I saw it in a documentary. 

207
00:06:58,141 --> 00:06:59,008
(They heard it in a documentary) 

208
00:06:59,008 --> 00:07:02,841
Right, it's a city we'd see in a documentary. 

209
00:07:02,841 --> 00:07:06,308
It's about 88% of Korea's total land area. 

210
00:07:06,941 --> 00:07:08,108
It's huge. 

211
00:07:08,108 --> 00:07:09,774
- Is it that big? / - Yes. 

212
00:07:09,774 --> 00:07:10,741
It's the biggest island. 

213
00:07:10,741 --> 00:07:12,308
It's beautiful. 

214
00:07:12,308 --> 00:07:13,808
- It was so... / - What's that? 

215
00:07:13,808 --> 00:07:14,808
- It's so beautiful. / - What's that? 

216
00:07:14,808 --> 00:07:16,608
- It looks so pretty. / - It's huge. 

217
00:07:16,608 --> 00:07:19,074
It's the biggest island in Russia. 

218
00:07:19,074 --> 00:07:20,641
But the population is only 500,000. 

219
00:07:20,641 --> 00:07:22,341
- It looks beautiful. / - I didn't know it was that big. 

220
00:07:22,341 --> 00:07:23,641
- It was so... / - What's that? 

221
00:07:23,641 --> 00:07:24,974
- It's so beautiful. / - What's that? 

222
00:07:24,974 --> 00:07:26,841
- It's a beautiful island. / - It looks amazing. 

223
00:07:26,841 --> 00:07:29,574
We don't need to go to Switzerland or Vancouver. 

224
00:07:29,574 --> 00:07:30,241
What's that? 

225
00:07:30,241 --> 00:07:31,974
(Russian and Korean people live together in Sakhalin) 

226
00:07:32,808 --> 00:07:37,208
(It's a place with a painful history) 

227
00:07:37,208 --> 00:07:38,541
It takes only 3 hours. 

228
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:40,308
- Oh, no. / - It looks so pretty. 

229
00:07:40,308 --> 00:07:41,308
What's that? 

230
00:07:41,308 --> 00:07:42,574
- I can't believe this. / - It looks white. 

231
00:07:42,574 --> 00:07:43,674
It looks great. 

232
00:07:43,674 --> 00:07:44,741
I'm so surprised. 

233
00:07:44,741 --> 00:07:46,208
Alright then. 

234
00:07:46,208 --> 00:07:48,241
- Shall we go to Sakhalin? / - Sakhalin? 

235
00:07:48,241 --> 00:07:48,908
Let's go there. 

236
00:07:48,908 --> 00:07:52,241
- Yeah! / - Oops. 

237
00:07:52,241 --> 00:07:54,008
- Let's go to Sakhalin. / - Let's go. 

238
00:07:54,008 --> 00:07:56,141
I've been to Russia before. 

239
00:07:56,141 --> 00:07:57,841
So I'll plan our trip 

240
00:07:57,841 --> 00:08:01,108
around the downtown on the first day. 

241
00:08:01,108 --> 00:08:02,174
You can... 

242
00:08:02,174 --> 00:08:04,241
- Plan a trip to the outskirts. / - Yes, the outskirts. 

243
00:08:04,241 --> 00:08:05,908
I'll look into the outskirts. 

244
00:08:05,908 --> 00:08:07,841
It's hard but I'll give it a try. 

245
00:08:09,041 --> 00:08:10,374
- Moa... / - Moa... 

246
00:08:10,374 --> 00:08:12,674
- Tour! / - Tour! 

247
00:08:13,008 --> 00:08:14,941
Bandung was very nice but I was disappointed... 

248
00:08:14,941 --> 00:08:16,808
- You didn't show us the ocean. / - Right. 

249
00:08:16,808 --> 00:08:18,341
We can finally see the ocean now. 

250
00:08:18,341 --> 00:08:20,941
It's so cool in winter. 

251
00:08:21,541 --> 00:08:23,274
- It's beautiful. / - It's Moscow. 

252
00:08:23,274 --> 00:08:25,141
We didn't go to Moscow. 

253
00:08:25,674 --> 00:08:27,508
We went to Vladivostok. 

254
00:08:27,508 --> 00:08:28,874
There are a lot of famous destinations. 

255
00:08:28,874 --> 00:08:30,208
(It's a place where culture, history, nature coexist) 

256
00:08:30,208 --> 00:08:31,274
What's that? 

257
00:08:31,274 --> 00:08:33,408
- It looks like Greece. / - It's amazing. 

258
00:08:33,408 --> 00:08:36,808
(The biggest island in Russia, Sakhalin) 

259
00:08:36,874 --> 00:08:41,341
(And there are two mysterious girls) 

260
00:08:41,908 --> 00:08:43,641
It feels like fall. 

261
00:08:43,641 --> 00:08:45,408
(They are cheerful at every moment) 

262
00:08:45,408 --> 00:08:46,774
I love it. 

263
00:08:46,774 --> 00:08:49,074
I think I can go alone. 

264
00:08:50,008 --> 00:08:51,008
Follow me. 

265
00:08:51,008 --> 00:08:53,274
(The energetic girl, Jooe) 

266
00:08:53,774 --> 00:08:55,308
(She's whimsical at every moment) 

267
00:08:57,174 --> 00:08:58,408
What was that? 

268
00:08:59,008 --> 00:09:00,041
Hi. 

269
00:09:00,341 --> 00:09:01,874
I'm spaced out. 

270
00:09:03,308 --> 00:09:05,041
Let's order one more glass. 

271
00:09:06,674 --> 00:09:07,908
I'm No-Face. 

272
00:09:07,908 --> 00:09:09,541
Oh, my God. 

273
00:09:09,541 --> 00:09:11,974
(The whimsical girl, Yeonwoo) 

274
00:09:11,974 --> 00:09:14,208
So Yeonwoo is a little eccentric. 

275
00:09:14,708 --> 00:09:15,908
That was my secret. 

276
00:09:16,974 --> 00:09:18,641
- Sakhalin. / - It's so pretty. 

277
00:09:18,641 --> 00:09:19,741
- Is it a cathedral? / - Yes. 

278
00:09:19,741 --> 00:09:21,908
- What's all that inside? / - It's a cathedral. 

279
00:09:21,908 --> 00:09:24,241
Oh, my God! Don't move! 

280
00:09:24,908 --> 00:09:26,408
That looks so scary. 

281
00:09:27,408 --> 00:09:28,808
We went to the outskirts. 

282
00:09:28,808 --> 00:09:30,674
(It's Mother Nature time) 

283
00:09:30,674 --> 00:09:32,908
- That's the Sea of Okhotsk. / - Wow, I feel so good. 

284
00:09:33,608 --> 00:09:36,208
(Living and breathing nature) 

285
00:09:38,408 --> 00:09:39,974
- Oh, no. / - They caught a fish! 

286
00:09:39,974 --> 00:09:42,308
I'm sure they set it up in advance. 

287
00:09:42,308 --> 00:09:44,141
What are you talking about? 

288
00:09:44,141 --> 00:09:46,341
- I love it. / - This is so good. 

289
00:09:46,341 --> 00:09:48,008
To be honest, I'm satisfied. 

290
00:09:48,008 --> 00:09:49,674
(There will be familiar looking foods as well) 

291
00:09:49,674 --> 00:09:50,908
Wasn't it Korean food just now? 

292
00:09:50,908 --> 00:09:53,074
- This is so good. / - This is it. 

293
00:09:54,074 --> 00:09:55,441
Cheers. 

294
00:09:55,941 --> 00:09:59,874
Moa Moa Tour! Bye! 

295
00:09:59,874 --> 00:10:02,174
- There's so much land. / - I like that they're so cheerful. 

296
00:10:02,974 --> 00:10:04,341
That's a Russian doll. 

297
00:10:05,008 --> 00:10:06,141
Russian doll. 

298
00:10:07,774 --> 00:10:09,341
Moa Moa Tour! 

299
00:10:09,341 --> 00:10:10,608
Yeah! 

300
00:10:10,608 --> 00:10:12,808
- Lie down. / - Lie down, lie down. 

301
00:10:12,808 --> 00:10:14,574
(Wriggling) 

302
00:10:15,041 --> 00:10:16,208
They're so rowdy. 

303
00:10:18,008 --> 00:10:19,241
They're so cute. 

304
00:10:20,508 --> 00:10:22,008
- I have to make them look bad. / - At that age... 

305
00:10:22,008 --> 00:10:23,941
- That's how you travel with friends. / - That's right. 

306
00:10:23,941 --> 00:10:25,574
- You crawl around. / - Exactly. 

307
00:10:25,574 --> 00:10:26,574
Crawl around?

(Moa Moa Tour, Jooe's Downtown Tour) 

309

(Moa Moa Tour, Yeonwoo's Outskirts Tour) 

310
00:10:35,874 --> 00:10:38,874
(Incheon International Airport, 8 a.m.) 

311
00:10:38,874 --> 00:10:41,741
Yeonwoo! Finally, the two of us... 

312
00:10:42,708 --> 00:10:43,741
Okay. 

313
00:10:44,474 --> 00:10:45,941
I didn't finish my sentence yet. 

314
00:10:45,941 --> 00:10:47,808
- They're in comfortable outfits. / - Here we go. 

315
00:10:47,808 --> 00:10:50,541
We're going on a trip. 

316
00:10:50,541 --> 00:10:52,974
- We're going on a trip. / - This is my first trip. 

317
00:10:53,474 --> 00:10:54,708
I've been abroad many times but... 

318
00:10:54,708 --> 00:10:57,641
This is almost your first time flying, isn't it? 

319
00:10:57,641 --> 00:10:59,174
- Hello. / - Hello. 

320
00:11:00,641 --> 00:11:01,974
It's a direct flight. 

321
00:11:01,974 --> 00:11:04,841
At 8:40 p.m. Oh, I'm sorry, your photo... 

322
00:11:04,841 --> 00:11:06,208
That scared me. 

323
00:11:07,341 --> 00:11:08,874
- Let us see the picture. / - I just saw a nightmare. 

324
00:11:08,874 --> 00:11:10,408
Please go to gate 45.

- See you later. / - Bye. 

332
00:11:26,774 --> 00:11:27,941
- Let's go. / - Let's go. 

333
00:11:28,908 --> 00:11:30,408
It was a direct flight. 

334
00:11:30,408 --> 00:11:32,974
- It's a direct flight. / - It took only 3 hours. 

335
00:11:32,974 --> 00:11:35,308
- 3 hours. / - It sounds really nice.

(Sakhalin) 

338

(Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk Airport, 2 p.m.) 

339
00:11:43,308 --> 00:11:44,974
- Is that the airport? / - That's the airport? 

340
00:11:44,974 --> 00:11:46,341
It looks so unique. 

341
00:11:46,341 --> 00:11:48,408
- I thought it was a gymnasium. / - Me too. 

342
00:11:48,408 --> 00:11:50,274
It's nothing like Sakhalin I've been imagining. 

343
00:11:50,274 --> 00:11:52,974
Oh, my! This is... 

344
00:11:52,974 --> 00:11:54,141
Sakhalin! 

345
00:11:54,141 --> 00:11:57,641
- Yeonwoo, this is Sakhalin! / - Is this Sakhalin? 

346
00:11:57,874 --> 00:12:00,341
Finally, we safely arrived in Sakhalin. 

347
00:12:00,341 --> 00:12:02,741
After flying 3 hours from Korea. 

348
00:12:02,741 --> 00:12:04,741
- We flew here. / - We're in Sakhalin. 

349
00:12:04,741 --> 00:12:06,741
- That's right. / - By the way, it's not so much... 

350
00:12:06,741 --> 00:12:09,074
- Colder than in Korea. / - I checked earlier. 

351
00:12:09,074 --> 00:12:10,608
- The weather in Korea. / - The weather is perfect. 

352
00:12:10,608 --> 00:12:13,574
- Korea is 23℃ now. / - 23℃. 

353
00:12:13,574 --> 00:12:15,641
And it's 18℃ here. 

354
00:12:15,641 --> 00:12:16,441
It's not that different. 

355
00:12:16,441 --> 00:12:18,541
It's the warmest time of the day. 

356
00:12:18,541 --> 00:12:20,541
18℃? That's... 

357
00:12:20,541 --> 00:12:22,274
- Like how it is here these days. / - It's not that cold. 

358
00:12:22,274 --> 00:12:24,841
The weather was not so different from here. 

359
00:12:25,441 --> 00:12:28,074
I've always thought it'd be freezing there. 

360
00:12:28,741 --> 00:12:31,241
- They even have foliage. / - It must be that time. 

361
00:12:31,241 --> 00:12:34,374
We need to get a ride from here. 

362
00:12:34,574 --> 00:12:36,308
Would you like to take a taxi or a bus? 

363
00:12:36,308 --> 00:12:38,341
I'd like to take a bus and... 

364
00:12:38,341 --> 00:12:41,074
- Enjoy the area. / - You want to feel Sakhalin. 

365
00:12:41,074 --> 00:12:42,608
I want to feel that I'm in Sakhalin. 

366
00:12:42,608 --> 00:12:43,374
(Where is their first destination?) 

367
00:12:43,374 --> 00:12:45,241
Where are we going, by the way? 

368
00:12:45,241 --> 00:12:49,208
We're going to the landmark of Sakhalin, 

369
00:12:49,208 --> 00:12:49,941
which is a cathedral. 

370
00:12:49,941 --> 00:12:51,141
- A cathedral? / - Yes. 

371
00:12:51,441 --> 00:12:53,641
We're going to a cathedral. 

372
00:12:53,641 --> 00:12:56,541
- The cathedral from before? / - In Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk... 

373
00:12:56,541 --> 00:12:58,241
- What's going on? / - There's a big cathedral. 

374
00:12:58,241 --> 00:12:59,141
What is this? 

375
00:12:59,774 --> 00:13:01,074
I recorded it. 

376
00:13:03,508 --> 00:13:07,274
- This is newly built. It was built last year. / - New? 

377
00:13:07,274 --> 00:13:09,741
It's a new building, built last year. 

378
00:13:09,741 --> 00:13:11,708
It's the landmark of Sakhalin. 

379
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:13,908
It's the Russian Orthodox Church. 

380
00:13:14,241 --> 00:13:16,408
I think we should go check out this place. 

381
00:13:16,408 --> 00:13:17,374
(Moa Moa Tour, Jooe's Downtown Tour) 

382
00:13:17,374 --> 00:13:21,641
(Cathedral of the Nativity) 

383
00:13:22,108 --> 00:13:24,341
- Now, let's take this white bus. / - Bus no. 3. 

384
00:13:24,341 --> 00:13:26,041
We'll take bus no. 3. 

385
00:13:26,041 --> 00:13:28,341
- Let's take the white bus. / - Yeonwoo. 

386
00:13:29,108 --> 00:13:30,508
Let me tell you something interesting. 

387
00:13:30,508 --> 00:13:32,508
- Yes. / - In Russia... 

388
00:13:32,508 --> 00:13:33,574
You get on the bus through the back door. 

389
00:13:33,574 --> 00:13:35,841
In Russia, you get on the bus through the rear door. 

390
00:13:35,841 --> 00:13:38,241
- You're right. / - And you pay as you get off... 

391
00:13:38,241 --> 00:13:40,341
Through the front door. Interesting, right? 

392
00:13:40,341 --> 00:13:42,208
It's been a long time since I've ridden a bus. 

393
00:13:42,208 --> 00:13:44,408
- Me too. / - Right? 

394
00:13:44,408 --> 00:13:45,674
It's been 2 to 3 years. 

395
00:13:45,674 --> 00:13:47,874
Haven't ridden one since I debuted. 

396
00:13:49,141 --> 00:13:50,974
There are a lot of trees. 

397
00:13:50,974 --> 00:13:52,808
The air must be clean here. 

398
00:13:56,341 --> 00:13:57,741
(Sakhalin, Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk) 

399
00:13:57,741 --> 00:13:59,208
Where are we going? 

400
00:13:59,208 --> 00:14:00,074
Just follow me. 

401
00:14:00,508 --> 00:14:02,808
We arrived much earlier than expected. 

402
00:14:06,574 --> 00:14:08,174
- It's worth coming here, isn't it? / - It is. 

403
00:14:08,174 --> 00:14:09,574
It's so pretty here. 

404
00:14:09,574 --> 00:14:11,041
It's amazing. 

405
00:14:12,308 --> 00:14:13,508
It's shiny. 

406
00:14:14,841 --> 00:14:16,908
- It's beautiful. / - It's so pretty. 

407
00:14:16,908 --> 00:14:19,474

408
00:14:19,908 --> 00:14:21,908

409
00:14:21,908 --> 00:14:24,174
- It was very shiny. / - It was so clean and beautiful. 

410
00:14:24,174 --> 00:14:25,841
The white color... 

411
00:14:25,841 --> 00:14:28,274
- Represents purity. / - Purity? 

412
00:14:28,274 --> 00:14:30,341
Yes, purity. The gold color represents light. 

413
00:14:30,474 --> 00:14:32,408
- Light. / - It's shiny like light. 

414
00:14:32,408 --> 00:14:35,474
- It does look very shiny. / - It has a sense of nobility. 

415
00:14:35,474 --> 00:14:37,774
(White for purity and gold for light and nobility) 

416
00:14:37,774 --> 00:14:39,508
It was really beautiful. 

417
00:14:40,174 --> 00:14:42,141
I can imagine it looking really beautiful in winter. 

418
00:14:42,141 --> 00:14:43,208
- Yes. / - With a white backdrop. 

419
00:14:43,708 --> 00:14:44,708
The weather looks really nice. 

420
00:14:46,141 --> 00:14:49,408
- Shall we go take a closer look? / - Shall we go in? 

421
00:14:49,408 --> 00:14:50,708
- Let's go. / - It looks so cool. 

422
00:14:50,708 --> 00:14:52,641
Doesn't it look like something in a movie? 

423
00:14:52,641 --> 00:14:55,074
I want to take this home. 

424
00:14:56,008 --> 00:14:57,741
- The cathedral? / - Yes. 

425
00:14:57,741 --> 00:14:59,574
I really wanted to take it home. 

426
00:14:59,574 --> 00:15:01,374
Can anyone go in? 

427
00:15:01,374 --> 00:15:03,341
Anyone can go in, 

428
00:15:03,341 --> 00:15:05,274
but you can't wear revealing clothes. 

429
00:15:05,274 --> 00:15:07,274
If you're a woman, your head should be... 

430
00:15:07,274 --> 00:15:08,008
- Covered? / - Yes. 

431
00:15:08,008 --> 00:15:10,841
You have to cover your head with something. 

432
00:15:10,841 --> 00:15:14,408
- You have to be respectful. / - I see. 

433
00:15:14,408 --> 00:15:18,741
(How does it look inside?) 

434
00:15:18,741 --> 00:15:20,474
- It sounded very scary. / - It's scary. 

435
00:15:21,974 --> 00:15:27,341
(You have to be quiet inside and enter with hats off) 

436
00:15:30,974 --> 00:15:32,208
- Gold door. / - What's all that? 

437
00:15:33,241 --> 00:15:34,474
(The inside is filled with colorful paintings and gold) 

438
00:15:34,474 --> 00:15:36,441
- It was really beautiful. / - It was so beautiful. 

439
00:15:36,441 --> 00:15:39,508
- It looks like a museum. / - It's very flashy inside. 

440
00:15:49,808 --> 00:15:51,308
Here... 

441
00:15:51,908 --> 00:15:54,874
Women have to put on a veil to cover their heads. 

442
00:15:54,874 --> 00:15:56,141
Women have to cover their hair. 

443
00:15:56,141 --> 00:15:58,374
- Men have to take off their hats. / - Right. 

444
00:15:58,874 --> 00:16:00,841
It seems like you can borrow the veils for free. 

445
00:16:00,841 --> 00:16:02,674
- So you can borrow them. / - Like that? 

446
00:16:02,674 --> 00:16:04,041
I think this will work. 

447
00:16:04,041 --> 00:16:04,641
Like this. 

448
00:16:04,641 --> 00:16:06,208
- There you go. / - She looks so pretty. 

449
00:16:06,208 --> 00:16:07,241
Now help me. 

450
00:16:09,641 --> 00:16:11,041
There you go. 

451
00:16:13,841 --> 00:16:14,874
It's pretty nice. 

452
00:16:14,874 --> 00:16:17,241
- It makes me feel reverent. / - I know. 

453
00:16:19,041 --> 00:16:21,208
The ceiling looks so beautiful. 

454
00:16:23,741 --> 00:16:26,108
How did they paint on the ceiling? 

455
00:16:27,174 --> 00:16:28,674
I know. It's amazing. 

456
00:16:30,241 --> 00:16:31,541
How did they paint on it? 

457
00:16:32,241 --> 00:16:34,241
- It's very big inside. / - How high is it? 

458
00:16:34,241 --> 00:16:35,708
(The entire walls are filled with paintings) 

459
00:16:35,708 --> 00:16:37,174
- How high up? / - It's 77m. 

460
00:16:37,174 --> 00:16:39,541
- 77m? / - 77m. 

461
00:16:43,108 --> 00:16:44,974
I want to hold this sight in my memory. 

462
00:16:47,941 --> 00:16:55,474
(Yeonwoo and Jooe can't take their eyes off) 

463
00:16:56,741 --> 00:16:58,874
It's more splendid inside than outside. 

464
00:16:58,874 --> 00:16:59,941
- It is. / - You're right. 

465
00:16:59,941 --> 00:17:02,041
There are only two colors on the outside. 

466
00:17:02,041 --> 00:17:04,908
Blue and gold. But the inside... 

467
00:17:05,208 --> 00:17:06,941
- It's very colorful. / - It's more beautiful... 

468
00:17:06,941 --> 00:17:08,074
- Because there are more colors. / - That's right. 

469
00:17:08,074 --> 00:17:09,708
It has very different colors from outside. 

470
00:17:10,308 --> 00:17:13,908
- It looks like a crown, doesn't it? / - You're right. 

471
00:17:14,574 --> 00:17:16,241
- Now... / - We're hungry. 

472
00:17:16,574 --> 00:17:19,008
Exactly. We should go eat. 

473
00:17:19,008 --> 00:17:20,708
I found a really... 

474
00:17:20,708 --> 00:17:23,108
- Good Russian restaurant. / - The weather is amazing. 

475
00:17:23,108 --> 00:17:24,108
A really good restaurant? 

476
00:17:24,108 --> 00:17:26,208
Who am I today? 

477
00:17:26,741 --> 00:17:27,774
I'm the trip planner today. 

478
00:17:27,774 --> 00:17:29,741
- Let's go. / - Okay. Let's go. 

479
00:17:29,741 --> 00:17:32,074
Even if you say this is an escalator... 

480
00:17:32,074 --> 00:17:33,541
- I'll believe you. / - This is an escalator. 

481
00:17:33,541 --> 00:17:34,541
Really? 

482
00:17:35,574 --> 00:17:37,274
What were we saying? 

483
00:17:37,274 --> 00:17:38,808
(Moa Moa Tour, Jooe's Downtown Tour) 

484
00:17:38,808 --> 00:17:44,174
(Russian food) 

485
00:17:44,541 --> 00:17:48,108
(3 minutes by car from the cathedral to the restaurant) 

486
00:17:48,108 --> 00:17:49,774
- It takes 3 minutes by car. / - It's so close. 

487
00:17:49,774 --> 00:17:51,741
- Are you looking forward to it? / - It's nearby. 

488
00:17:51,741 --> 00:17:53,241
There aren't many people on the street. 

489
00:17:54,141 --> 00:17:56,408
The population density is not so high 

490
00:17:56,408 --> 00:17:57,874
compared to the size of the land. 

491
00:17:57,874 --> 00:17:59,274
They have really lovely colors. 

492
00:17:59,274 --> 00:18:02,308
- The buildings are so colorful. / - Red, green, yellow. 

493
00:18:03,041 --> 00:18:05,274
- The buildings look so pretty. / - It's very relaxing. 

494
00:18:05,274 --> 00:18:08,108
- Green, blue... / - Isn't this the place? 

495
00:18:08,841 --> 00:18:09,874
How did you know it? 

496
00:18:10,841 --> 00:18:12,908
- How did you know it? / - Obviously, it's crowded. 

497
00:18:14,274 --> 00:18:16,308
Hi. 

498
00:18:17,108 --> 00:18:18,474
- I'm so hungry. / - Me too. 

499
00:18:19,374 --> 00:18:20,608
Let's go eat. 

500
00:18:20,608 --> 00:18:22,608
I'm going to eat a lot. 

501
00:18:23,908 --> 00:18:28,308
(The restaurant is full of matryoshka dolls) 

502
00:18:29,708 --> 00:18:32,408
- It feels like Christmas. / - It has a Christmas vibe. 

503
00:18:32,408 --> 00:18:33,574
It's very unique. 

504
00:18:34,074 --> 00:18:35,374
I'm curious about Russian food. 

505
00:18:35,374 --> 00:18:37,008
- Me too. / - I know. 

506
00:18:37,008 --> 00:18:38,574
I love the ambiance here. 

507
00:18:38,574 --> 00:18:39,841
I love the tables too. 

508
00:18:39,841 --> 00:18:40,941
I love it here. 

509
00:18:41,874 --> 00:18:43,741
It'll be perfect if they have great food too. 

510
00:18:44,408 --> 00:18:45,474
I'm sure it'll be great. 

511
00:18:45,474 --> 00:18:47,208
- I think it'll be great. / - Seriously... 

512
00:18:47,208 --> 00:18:49,674
I only ordered their most famous dishes. 

513
00:18:49,674 --> 00:18:50,708
How famous are they? 

514
00:18:51,508 --> 00:18:52,608
They're as famous as Yeonwoo. 

515
00:18:53,508 --> 00:18:55,641
Then they're not so famous. There's a long way to go. 

516
00:18:55,641 --> 00:18:56,774
As famous as Yeonwoo. 

517
00:18:56,774 --> 00:18:57,841
"There's a long way to go." 

518
00:18:58,308 --> 00:18:59,341
I'll work harder. 

519
00:18:59,941 --> 00:19:05,508
(Jooe prepared famous Russian dishes) 

520
00:19:06,141 --> 00:19:07,941
- Are you drinking beer? / - Yes, we are! 

521
00:19:07,941 --> 00:19:09,441
That's the best. 

522
00:19:09,441 --> 00:19:11,908
- The beer is better than expected. / - Looks tasty. 

523
00:19:11,908 --> 00:19:12,908
Really? 

524
00:19:13,608 --> 00:19:15,974
(A Russian salad, Olivier) 

525
00:19:15,974 --> 00:19:17,908
- What is that? / - Isn't that canned food? 

526
00:19:17,908 --> 00:19:19,208
- Isn't that so cute? / - You're right. 

527
00:19:20,108 --> 00:19:22,474
(Rump steak) 

528
00:19:23,041 --> 00:19:26,341
(Pelmeni, Russian dumplings) 

529
00:19:26,341 --> 00:19:27,174
(With cherries!) 

530
00:19:27,174 --> 00:19:28,641
- What's inside? / - Cherries. 

531
00:19:28,641 --> 00:19:30,241
- Cherries are stuffed inside. / - What is that? 

532
00:19:30,241 --> 00:19:32,608
- Why would they do such a thing? / - It has cherries? 

533
00:19:34,874 --> 00:19:39,541
(Including beer, the whole meal costs $27) 

534
00:19:42,974 --> 00:19:44,574
Thank you. 

535
00:19:44,574 --> 00:19:45,608
Thank you. 

536
00:19:49,941 --> 00:19:51,708
Honey was added. Honey. 

537
00:19:51,708 --> 00:19:53,741
- Honey? That sounds good. / - Was their beer good? 

538
00:19:53,741 --> 00:19:55,908
- How was it? / - It was so good. 

539
00:19:57,708 --> 00:20:02,674
(How is the famous Russian honey beer?) 

540
00:20:07,308 --> 00:20:09,174
She's completely won over by the honey beer. 

541
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:11,608
- I guess it's really good. / - I really want to try it. 

542
00:20:14,108 --> 00:20:15,108
So cute. 

543
00:20:17,908 --> 00:20:19,241
You have my trust now. 

544
00:20:19,241 --> 00:20:20,241
- Really? / - Yes. 

545
00:20:20,608 --> 00:20:21,641
I'm going to... 

546
00:20:21,641 --> 00:20:22,841
(Jooe is getting excited) 

547
00:20:22,841 --> 00:20:24,908
A glass of beer before food is served. 

548
00:20:25,441 --> 00:20:27,708
- That's the best. / - She's getting excited. 

549
00:20:27,708 --> 00:20:29,241
I told you to just trust me. 

550
00:20:29,241 --> 00:20:31,541
(A glass of honey beer excites her to the fullest) 

551
00:20:32,008 --> 00:20:34,474
- I love it. / - I thought it would be just sweet. 

552
00:20:34,474 --> 00:20:36,608
- It's sweet and sour. / - It's sweet and sour. 

553
00:20:36,608 --> 00:20:38,174
- It's fruity. / - This is... 

554
00:20:38,174 --> 00:20:41,808
This beer is light. Even light drinkers can... 

555
00:20:41,808 --> 00:20:42,641
- Enjoy this beer. / - That's right. 

556
00:20:42,641 --> 00:20:45,041
- You drink well. / - You don't get to travel often. 

557
00:20:45,041 --> 00:20:46,808
Since Russia is a cold country... 

558
00:20:46,808 --> 00:20:49,508
- What's that salad? / - They eat a lot of canned food. 

559
00:20:49,508 --> 00:20:52,708
So they've just designed this dish like that. 

560
00:20:52,708 --> 00:20:55,574
If you lift this, it'll pop out. 

561
00:20:55,574 --> 00:20:58,074
You should lift it since I prepared this meal for you. 

562
00:20:58,074 --> 00:20:59,574
- Okay. / - Yeonwoo... 

563
00:20:59,574 --> 00:21:01,741
- Do whatever you want to do. / - Let me try it. 

564
00:21:02,841 --> 00:21:04,041
Let's see. There you go. 

565
00:21:07,274 --> 00:21:08,908
- Have a taste. / - What is this? 

566
00:21:08,908 --> 00:21:12,274
(How does this unique salad taste?) 

567
00:21:12,274 --> 00:21:15,974
Russians eat this dish on the New Year's Day. 

568
00:21:15,974 --> 00:21:19,074
It's one of their common salads. 

569
00:21:24,608 --> 00:21:26,408
This has a familiar taste. 

570
00:21:26,408 --> 00:21:27,274
- Really? / - Yes. 

571
00:21:27,974 --> 00:21:29,641
It's like a home cooked meal. 

572
00:21:30,408 --> 00:21:31,108
Right? 

573
00:21:32,108 --> 00:21:33,841
- This is just like... / - Tastes like mom's cooking. 

574
00:21:33,841 --> 00:21:35,141
They eat that for the New Year. 

575
00:21:35,141 --> 00:21:37,574
It's like that vegetable salad at the school cafeteria. 

576
00:21:37,574 --> 00:21:38,574
Do you know it? The one with mayonnaise. 

577
00:21:38,574 --> 00:21:40,174
- The thing that tastes bad. / - It tastes good! 

578
00:21:40,174 --> 00:21:42,174
- It's delicious. / - Why are you being like this? 

579
00:21:42,174 --> 00:21:43,674
Don't you eat a lot of salad buns? 

580
00:21:43,674 --> 00:21:45,408
- It's bad for you too. / - That's not true. 

581
00:21:46,274 --> 00:21:47,574
It's the salad in the salad buns. 

582
00:21:47,574 --> 00:21:48,974
- It's like that salad. / - You're right. 

583
00:21:48,974 --> 00:21:53,108
I can tell that it's high-calorie although it's a salad. 

584
00:21:53,108 --> 00:21:54,874
- Since it's a cold country. / - I want to eat it with bread. 

585
00:21:55,408 --> 00:21:58,208
- I don't usually eat salads. / - You don't eat it at all. 

586
00:21:58,208 --> 00:22:00,208
(Feeling embarrassed) 

587
00:22:00,208 --> 00:22:02,041
Don't try to embellish it. 

588
00:22:02,041 --> 00:22:03,641
I only eat flour for my vegetable fix. 

589
00:22:03,641 --> 00:22:08,041
But this is delicious enough for me to eat this salad. 

590
00:22:08,041 --> 00:22:10,574
(This salad is perfect for Yeonwoo who hates veggies) 

591
00:22:11,241 --> 00:22:14,508
(The familiarity of the taste makes them keep eating) 

592
00:22:15,508 --> 00:22:19,074
(Aggressively eating the appetizer) 

593
00:22:20,074 --> 00:22:21,274
They finished the salad. 

594
00:22:21,541 --> 00:22:23,608
The flow can't be cut off. Hurry and give us food. 

595
00:22:23,608 --> 00:22:24,974
I'm hungry. 

596
00:22:26,174 --> 00:22:27,708
(The main dish is served at last) 

597
00:22:27,708 --> 00:22:28,941
Let's give it a warm welcome. 

598
00:22:29,808 --> 00:22:31,108
- Should we have a bite of this? / - Yes. 

599
00:22:31,108 --> 00:22:31,941
Rump steak. 

600
00:22:32,641 --> 00:22:35,008
What's the sauce for? It's to dip it, of course. 

601
00:22:35,008 --> 00:22:36,308
- It looks like pork cutlet. / - Is it fried? 

602
00:22:36,308 --> 00:22:37,741
It looks like a fried meatball. 

603
00:22:39,274 --> 00:22:40,308
(Big dip) 

604
00:22:40,308 --> 00:22:42,008
I normally don't eat meat with sauce. 

605
00:22:42,008 --> 00:22:43,174
Maybe we shouldn't have dipped then. 

606
00:22:43,174 --> 00:22:45,908
(How does the steak taste?) 

607
00:22:49,208 --> 00:22:51,474
- What is it? / - What? What is it? 

608
00:22:51,474 --> 00:22:52,941
What is it? Is it horseradish? 

609
00:22:52,941 --> 00:22:53,974
(This is Russian horseradish) 

610
00:22:53,974 --> 00:22:55,908
This wasabi is really strong. 

611
00:22:55,908 --> 00:22:57,074
You put too much sauce on it. 

612
00:22:57,074 --> 00:22:58,608
Horseradish is spicy. 

613
00:22:59,474 --> 00:23:00,841
They should have tasted it first. 

614
00:23:00,841 --> 00:23:01,941
What is this? Seriously. 

615
00:23:01,941 --> 00:23:03,508
It was really spicy. 

616
00:23:03,508 --> 00:23:06,208
- You should've tasted the sauce first. / - Exactly. 

617
00:23:06,208 --> 00:23:10,174
- I thought it was a sour sauce. / - I know. 

618
00:23:10,174 --> 00:23:11,874
(Attacked by horseradish without warning) 

619
00:23:11,874 --> 00:23:14,274
You thought it was the sauce for the French fries. 

620
00:23:14,274 --> 00:23:15,841
- Yes, precisely. / - I'm crying now. 

621
00:23:17,841 --> 00:23:19,241
- What is this? / - I have a runny nose. 

622
00:23:20,074 --> 00:23:21,641
- This is nice. It's tasty. / - Yes. 

623
00:23:21,641 --> 00:23:23,674
- This is good. / - It's good. 

624
00:23:23,674 --> 00:23:24,841
(However, the steak tastes good) 

625
00:23:24,841 --> 00:23:27,008
- This is pretty good. / - Yes, it really is. 

626
00:23:27,008 --> 00:23:28,541
This is just like the meat pancakes. 

627
00:23:28,541 --> 00:23:30,874
It's chewier and plumper than that. 

628
00:23:30,874 --> 00:23:32,241
What an interesting dish. 

629
00:23:32,241 --> 00:23:34,774
It tastes different with the wasabi sauce. 

630
00:23:34,774 --> 00:23:36,174
I want to eat that. 

631
00:23:36,174 --> 00:23:37,608
I think I can cook this. 

632
00:23:37,608 --> 00:23:38,674
Isn't that a Korean dish? 

633
00:23:38,674 --> 00:23:40,641
- It looks like Korean pancakes. / - That dish... 

634
00:23:40,641 --> 00:23:43,841
Is a really popular food in Russia. 

635
00:23:45,741 --> 00:23:46,941
(We ought to eat meat) 

636
00:23:46,941 --> 00:23:48,008
Meat is always good. 

637
00:23:49,008 --> 00:23:50,374
- It's meat. / - People should enjoy eating meat. 

638
00:23:51,141 --> 00:23:53,174
We have more food. Yeonwoo, we have another dish. 

639
00:23:53,174 --> 00:23:54,641
(The next dish is served right away) 

640
00:23:56,041 --> 00:23:58,308
- The cherry dumplings. / - Thank you. 

641
00:23:59,141 --> 00:24:00,274
- Thank you. / - Thank you. 

642
00:24:00,274 --> 00:24:01,441
Yeonwoo, you try it first. 

643
00:24:01,441 --> 00:24:03,341
- What are you saying? / - Hurry. 

644
00:24:03,341 --> 00:24:04,674
- I'm curious about that dish. / - Cherry dumpling? 

645
00:24:05,074 --> 00:24:07,408
- I'm not sure about this one. / - It's red. 

646
00:24:10,008 --> 00:24:13,208
(Will the cherries and dumplings go well together?) 

647
00:24:14,041 --> 00:24:16,541
(She's half curious and half worried) 

648
00:24:19,708 --> 00:24:20,874
- That's bad, right? / - She tried it. 

649
00:24:21,274 --> 00:24:23,941
- That's not good, right? / - What is it? What? 

650
00:24:23,941 --> 00:24:25,108
- What is it? / - Is it too sweet? 

651
00:24:25,108 --> 00:24:27,741
(Laughing) 

652
00:24:28,808 --> 00:24:32,474
Well, this dish isn't for me. 

653
00:24:32,474 --> 00:24:35,008
And the one I chose was particularly red. 

654
00:24:35,474 --> 00:24:36,274
It was particularly red. 

655
00:24:36,274 --> 00:24:38,308
- The outside looked red. / - The cherries... 

656
00:24:38,308 --> 00:24:39,174
Geez. 

657
00:24:39,174 --> 00:24:41,108
- It pops like this. Look. / - Why? It looks unique. 

658
00:24:41,108 --> 00:24:44,941
- I can't eat hot food. / - The cherries smell nice. 

659
00:24:44,941 --> 00:24:46,874
But the cherries are warm. 

660
00:24:46,874 --> 00:24:49,741
- Can't we think of it as a cherry pie? / - Right. 

661
00:24:49,741 --> 00:24:50,741
No, it's more like... 

662
00:24:50,741 --> 00:24:52,741
A steamed dumpling stuffed with cherry isn't of meat. 

663
00:24:52,741 --> 00:24:54,074
- Steamed cherry dumpling? / - Yes. 

664
00:24:56,008 --> 00:24:57,274
(Jooe tries one too) 

665
00:24:57,274 --> 00:24:59,508
I prefer cold food over hot. 

666
00:25:00,874 --> 00:25:02,874
(Showing approval) 

667
00:25:02,874 --> 00:25:03,908
I like it. 

668
00:25:03,908 --> 00:25:06,474
Really? Everyone has a different preference. 

669
00:25:06,941 --> 00:25:09,708
This is more of a dessert. 

670
00:25:09,708 --> 00:25:11,041
I really like it. 

671
00:25:12,708 --> 00:25:14,208
- Are you serious? / - Yes, I really like it. 

672
00:25:14,208 --> 00:25:16,174
Then I'll eat this steak. 

673
00:25:17,874 --> 00:25:19,608
Hey, here it is. Here it is. 

674
00:25:19,608 --> 00:25:21,341
Thank you. Thank you. 

675
00:25:21,341 --> 00:25:22,841
Thank you. 

676
00:25:22,841 --> 00:25:24,708
- Guess what it is. / - What is this? 

677
00:25:24,708 --> 00:25:26,274
This is a special dish for you. 

678
00:25:26,274 --> 00:25:28,174
You can only find this in Sakhalin. 

679
00:25:28,174 --> 00:25:30,641
These are dumplings with crab meat. 

680
00:25:30,641 --> 00:25:32,808
Actually, it's either a hit-or-miss. 

681
00:25:32,808 --> 00:25:34,708
- I chose this dish just for you. / - Salmon roe. 

682
00:25:35,574 --> 00:25:36,874
- I remember that. / - That looks delicious. 

683
00:25:36,874 --> 00:25:39,074
Pelmeni is dumplings. 

684
00:25:39,074 --> 00:25:40,674
These are similar to dumplings in Korea. 

685
00:25:41,174 --> 00:25:44,174
- That one looks good. / - That was to die for. 

686
00:25:49,941 --> 00:25:52,108
After observing Jooe's face, this dish is really good. 

687
00:25:52,108 --> 00:25:53,041
Yes, it was. 

688
00:25:53,574 --> 00:25:55,374
I'm just going to trust you. I'll trust you. 

689
00:25:55,374 --> 00:25:57,374
- This is really good. / - I won't taste cherries, right? 

690
00:25:57,374 --> 00:25:58,474
(She's doubtful at first) 

691
00:25:58,474 --> 00:26:01,441
You can really taste the crab meat. 

692
00:26:01,441 --> 00:26:03,341
It has cream pasta sauce. 

693
00:26:03,341 --> 00:26:07,041
It's a crab dumpling with cream pasta sauce. 

694
00:26:07,041 --> 00:26:08,341
- That one looks really good. / - That looks tasty. 

695
00:26:08,341 --> 00:26:10,341
It was really good. That dish was divine. 

696
00:26:10,341 --> 00:26:11,974
It's not as heavy as I thought. 

697
00:26:11,974 --> 00:26:13,608
Right when you think it's going to get heavy, 

698
00:26:13,608 --> 00:26:14,408
it has a clean taste. 

699
00:26:14,874 --> 00:26:16,974
You have to try this in Russia. 

700
00:26:16,974 --> 00:26:20,141
People of all ages will love this. 

701
00:26:21,574 --> 00:26:24,541
It was really tasty. After that, I could trust Jooe. 

702
00:26:25,074 --> 00:26:26,241
- It was that good? / - Yes. 

703
00:26:26,241 --> 00:26:28,441
(They eat all they want without worrying) 

704
00:26:32,241 --> 00:26:35,908
(The food has disappeared instantly once again) 

705
00:26:35,908 --> 00:26:37,541
- That must go well with beer. / - I could trust her. 

706
00:26:37,541 --> 00:26:39,541
- Yes, it went well with beer. / - Yes. 

707
00:26:39,541 --> 00:26:41,041
She emptied her beer. 

708
00:26:41,041 --> 00:26:42,274
- Suji. / - Yes? 

709
00:26:42,274 --> 00:26:43,741
I think you just got won over. 

710
00:26:43,741 --> 00:26:46,008
No, no. Not at all. 

711
00:26:46,808 --> 00:26:48,874
The beer was so good. 

712
00:26:48,874 --> 00:26:51,874
- Yeonwoo, we just ate. / - Yes. 

713
00:26:51,874 --> 00:26:53,274
We should set out again. 

714
00:26:53,274 --> 00:26:55,441
- Is that why you fed me? / - We're MOMOLAND. 

715
00:26:55,874 --> 00:26:56,874
Right. 

716
00:26:56,874 --> 00:26:58,941
- We'll go to the amusement park. / - MOMOLAND. 

717
00:26:59,308 --> 00:27:00,941
Let's move. 

718
00:27:00,941 --> 00:27:02,041
That sounds great. 

719
00:27:02,041 --> 00:27:05,174
There's an amusement park in the city center. 

720
00:27:05,174 --> 00:27:06,941
- An amusement park? / - Wow, amazing. 

721
00:27:06,941 --> 00:27:10,141
- This is pretty. / - They have the Viking as well. 

722
00:27:10,874 --> 00:27:12,274
Are you good with rides? 

723
00:27:12,641 --> 00:27:13,708
I'm really good. 

724
00:27:13,708 --> 00:27:16,041
I'm good too. I'm a master. 

725
00:27:16,041 --> 00:27:18,341
- I'm no joke. / - I'm an adult. 

726
00:27:18,341 --> 00:27:19,574
(Moa Moa Tour, Jooe's Downtown Tour) 

727
00:27:19,574 --> 00:27:22,808
(Gagarin Park) 

728
00:27:22,808 --> 00:27:24,308
- Gagarin Park. / - Gagarin Park. 

729
00:27:24,308 --> 00:27:28,941
(12 minutes from the restaurant to the park by car) 

730
00:27:28,941 --> 00:27:31,741
- A walk in a park after drinking... / - That's so pretty. 

731
00:27:31,741 --> 00:27:34,441
- Honey beer is nice. / - The ground is spinning. 

732
00:27:35,108 --> 00:27:37,574
- Yeonwoo, this place... / - I can't run. I'll feel nauseous. 

733
00:27:38,074 --> 00:27:40,441
- It's called Gagarin Park. / - Okay. 

734
00:27:40,441 --> 00:27:43,874
The locals in Sakhalin visit this place a lot. 

735
00:27:43,874 --> 00:27:45,608
- It's a park. / - It's huge. 

736
00:27:46,308 --> 00:27:47,308
It's so beautiful. 

737
00:27:47,308 --> 00:27:49,741
Actually, the park was originally named 

738
00:27:49,741 --> 00:27:50,808
something else. 

739
00:27:50,808 --> 00:27:51,774
They changed it. 

740
00:27:51,774 --> 00:27:57,374
(Locals often enjoy a walk among birch and fir trees) 

741
00:28:00,774 --> 00:28:03,974
Unlike the colorfulness of Bandung... 

742
00:28:03,974 --> 00:28:05,941
- This offers a different vibe. / - It's very tranquil. 

743
00:28:05,941 --> 00:28:07,474
- It's romantic. / - Right. 

744
00:28:07,474 --> 00:28:09,308
This is a great place to come with kids. 

745
00:28:09,308 --> 00:28:11,208
Absolutely. Or with pets. 

746
00:28:11,208 --> 00:28:12,974
- I'm a companion animal. / - Companion animals. 

747
00:28:14,141 --> 00:28:15,541
Happy, run. 

748
00:28:16,441 --> 00:28:17,474
Happy. 

749
00:28:19,908 --> 00:28:21,008
What are we doing? 

750
00:28:21,008 --> 00:28:25,041
The trees here are birch trees and fir trees. 

751
00:28:25,041 --> 00:28:26,441
The trail is made up of these trees. 

752
00:28:26,441 --> 00:28:28,174
Do you know how to massage your back? 

753
00:28:30,374 --> 00:28:32,141
(Showing perfect teamwork) 

754
00:28:32,141 --> 00:28:34,941
Birch and fir trees emanate a lot of phytoncides. 

755
00:28:34,941 --> 00:28:37,108
- That's true. / - It must be so aromatic. 

756
00:28:37,108 --> 00:28:42,874
(They're enjoying the short Russian autumn) 

757
00:28:45,774 --> 00:28:47,274
- We can try... / - Okay. 

758
00:28:47,274 --> 00:28:49,941
Many different things here. Just follow me. 

759
00:28:51,274 --> 00:28:53,474
The park is huge. 

760
00:28:55,241 --> 00:28:56,974
It is huge indeed. 

761
00:28:56,974 --> 00:28:57,974
The amusement park is superb. 

762
00:28:57,974 --> 00:29:00,574
- We're at the amusement park! / - Yes! 

763
00:29:00,574 --> 00:29:04,041
It's an amusement park for Yeonwoo! 

764
00:29:05,941 --> 00:29:09,774
The rides only operate from May to October. 

765
00:29:09,774 --> 00:29:11,608
- They don't operate in winter? / - No. 

766
00:29:11,608 --> 00:29:13,174
This park somehow... 

767
00:29:13,574 --> 00:29:15,041
Seems desolate. 

768
00:29:15,041 --> 00:29:16,074
Exactly. 

769
00:29:17,341 --> 00:29:18,641
There are almost no people. 

770
00:29:18,641 --> 00:29:20,908
Only a few things operate 

771
00:29:20,908 --> 00:29:22,741
during the weekdays. 

772
00:29:22,741 --> 00:29:24,108
I don't think we need to wait in line. 

773
00:29:24,108 --> 00:29:25,008
I'll ride something scary. 

774
00:29:25,008 --> 00:29:26,808
- Because I'm a grown up. / - A scary ride? 

775
00:29:26,808 --> 00:29:28,841
Yes, because I'm a grown up. 

776
00:29:29,341 --> 00:29:32,841
- I'm not interested in kid's rides. / - Not interested? 

777
00:29:32,841 --> 00:29:35,474
- Let's ride the Viking! / - Okay. 

778
00:29:35,474 --> 00:29:37,841
We should ride a Russian Viking. 

779
00:29:37,841 --> 00:29:39,208
That's right. A Viking is a must. 

780
00:29:40,408 --> 00:29:41,441
That looks cute. 

781
00:29:41,441 --> 00:29:43,741
(They seem excited about riding the Viking) 

782
00:29:43,741 --> 00:29:45,474
Are you talking about that children's Viking? 

783
00:29:46,008 --> 00:29:47,341
Are we getting on that one? 

784
00:29:47,341 --> 00:29:50,074
Are we getting on that children's Viking? 

785
00:29:50,074 --> 00:29:52,274
- Hello. / - Hello. 

786
00:29:53,741 --> 00:29:56,374
- I'm excited. / - We thought nothing of it. 

787
00:29:56,374 --> 00:29:58,674
- Doesn't it look cute? / - Gosh, it was scary. 

788
00:29:58,674 --> 00:29:59,608
Isn't that for children? 

789
00:30:00,174 --> 00:30:03,008
I don't think it'll be that scary. 

790
00:30:04,874 --> 00:30:08,341
(Viking ride, $3.20) 

791
00:30:10,408 --> 00:30:12,174
(This is the only safety feature) 

792
00:30:12,174 --> 00:30:14,374
The safety bar only goes down to here. 

793
00:30:14,374 --> 00:30:15,674
(Looking at the safety bar, it must not be scary) 

794
00:30:15,674 --> 00:30:17,774
- I don't think it'll be scary. / - I don't think so either. 

795
00:30:17,774 --> 00:30:19,874
What? Why is it starting so suddenly? 

796
00:30:19,874 --> 00:30:21,941
- It scared me. / - It makes a scary sound. 

797
00:30:21,941 --> 00:30:23,141
What's that noise? 

798
00:30:23,141 --> 00:30:25,774
- It sounds like it's really old. / - What? 

799
00:30:25,774 --> 00:30:27,641
It's the sound of the rubber tire underneath. 

800
00:30:28,274 --> 00:30:30,608
- It's like a haunted house. / - It sounds terrifying. 

801
00:30:31,174 --> 00:30:33,841
- Wait. Isn't this really old? / - What's wrong with it? 

802
00:30:33,841 --> 00:30:34,708
(It sounds horrible) 

803
00:30:35,741 --> 00:30:37,041
I hate it. 

804
00:30:37,041 --> 00:30:38,941
I haven't been on a ride in so long. 

805
00:30:39,908 --> 00:30:41,141
Look at the height. 

806
00:30:41,141 --> 00:30:42,474
It goes up really high. 

807
00:30:42,474 --> 00:30:43,274
That looks pretty scary. 

808
00:30:43,808 --> 00:30:46,874
- That tree has been cut. / - Really? 

809
00:30:46,874 --> 00:30:49,341
- Like in the shape of the Viking? / - Yes. 

810
00:30:49,341 --> 00:30:52,274
It couldn't grow because the Viking kept touching it. 

811
00:30:52,274 --> 00:30:53,474
Goodness. 

812
00:30:54,274 --> 00:30:56,341
Jooe, you don't seem scared. 

813
00:30:59,441 --> 00:31:04,041
(They start enjoying the Viking) 

814
00:31:07,808 --> 00:31:13,274
(Jooe is super excited) 

815
00:31:15,708 --> 00:31:17,008
Yeonwoo, was that scary? 

816
00:31:17,008 --> 00:31:18,374
It was really scary. 

817
00:31:18,374 --> 00:31:20,341
- I kept asking to stop. / - She can't open her eyes. 

818
00:31:24,408 --> 00:31:26,941
- That tree is hilarious. / - It is. 

819
00:31:26,941 --> 00:31:29,208
That tree has a straight line. 

820
00:31:31,341 --> 00:31:35,141
(Struggling) 

821
00:31:35,141 --> 00:31:36,941
It tickles. 

822
00:31:36,941 --> 00:31:37,608
(Her heart tickles) 

823
00:31:37,608 --> 00:31:39,908
Jooe, were you happy or scared? 

824
00:31:39,908 --> 00:31:41,074
I felt ticklish. 

825
00:31:41,074 --> 00:31:42,274
Ticklish? 

826
00:31:42,274 --> 00:31:44,308
- Ticklish? / - That tickles a lot. 

827
00:31:44,308 --> 00:31:45,974
- I've never... / - What's that? 

828
00:31:45,974 --> 00:31:47,608
- Ridden one for so long. / - Me too. 

829
00:31:47,608 --> 00:31:48,541
This was the first time. 

830
00:31:48,541 --> 00:31:51,074
He kept it going because there were no other people. 

831
00:31:51,074 --> 00:31:53,008
He kept laughing. 

832
00:31:53,008 --> 00:31:54,274
(They enjoyed the Viking in an empty park) 

833
00:31:54,274 --> 00:31:55,708
Stop! 

834
00:31:56,874 --> 00:31:58,874
- Stop! / - Let's go for a different one. 

835
00:31:59,774 --> 00:32:01,074
Can't we take a break? 

836
00:32:01,274 --> 00:32:02,674
She's being dragged. 

837
00:32:02,674 --> 00:32:04,508
When I was little, 

838
00:32:04,508 --> 00:32:07,841
I dreamed of being in an amusement park alone. 

839
00:32:07,841 --> 00:32:10,241
It's nice because that's what they experienced. 

840
00:32:10,941 --> 00:32:12,408
Is there something else you want to ride? 

841
00:32:12,408 --> 00:32:14,374
I want something scarier. 

842
00:32:14,374 --> 00:32:15,608
- Scarier? / - Because I'm a grown up. 

843
00:32:15,608 --> 00:32:17,941
- I found something scarier. / - You can't even ride it. 

844
00:32:18,808 --> 00:32:20,541
This looks scary. 

845
00:32:20,541 --> 00:32:21,841
This is it. 

846
00:32:21,841 --> 00:32:23,008
This is it! 

847
00:32:23,008 --> 00:32:26,274
This ominous feeling is never wrong. 

848
00:32:26,274 --> 00:32:28,541
- Move! / - This is really scary. 

849
00:32:28,541 --> 00:32:30,174
This drops down at once. 

850
00:32:30,174 --> 00:32:31,708
- What's this? / - This is really scary. 

851
00:32:31,708 --> 00:32:32,874
Isn't there one in Korea too? 

852
00:32:32,874 --> 00:32:34,074
- I was really shocked to see that. / - No, it's not. 

853
00:32:34,074 --> 00:32:34,974
- Isn't it the same one? / - It's not? 

854
00:32:35,708 --> 00:32:36,774
This one spins. 

855
00:32:37,574 --> 00:32:39,041
(What is this?) 

856
00:32:39,041 --> 00:32:41,608
- This looks super scary. / - That's too high! 

857
00:32:41,608 --> 00:32:43,208
(This tower is higher than the Ferris wheel) 

858
00:32:43,208 --> 00:32:44,941
- What's this? / - This is really scary. 

859
00:32:44,941 --> 00:32:46,341
This drops down at once. 

860
00:32:46,708 --> 00:32:48,441
It's higher than a Ferris wheel. 

861
00:32:48,441 --> 00:32:49,974
Isn't there one in Korea too? 

862
00:32:49,974 --> 00:32:51,408
- I was really shocked to see that. / - No, it's not. 

863
00:32:51,408 --> 00:32:52,708
No? It's not that one? 

864
00:32:52,708 --> 00:32:53,741
This one spins. 

865
00:32:55,874 --> 00:32:58,508
- This looks super scary. / - That's too high! 

866
00:32:58,508 --> 00:32:59,141
(It's a swing ride) 

867
00:32:59,141 --> 00:33:00,874
- You feel like you might die. / - Really? 

868
00:33:00,874 --> 00:33:02,708
That was really scary. 

869
00:33:03,041 --> 00:33:05,941
That looks like a swing... 

870
00:33:05,941 --> 00:33:08,308
- At a playground. / - That chain looks too thin. 

871
00:33:08,308 --> 00:33:09,574
Compared to the height... 

872
00:33:09,574 --> 00:33:11,474
My heart is racing like crazy. 

873
00:33:12,308 --> 00:33:15,941
(Jooe is waiting comfortably) 

874
00:33:16,608 --> 00:33:18,108
It's going up. 

875
00:33:18,108 --> 00:33:21,841
(The swings take off) 

876
00:33:22,074 --> 00:33:23,141
It's going up. 

877
00:33:24,341 --> 00:33:25,474
It's going up. 

878
00:33:25,941 --> 00:33:26,941
Unbelievable! 

879
00:33:31,341 --> 00:33:33,108
- It's so high. / - It keeps going up. 

880
00:33:33,108 --> 00:33:35,341
It's really scary. 

881
00:33:35,341 --> 00:33:37,708
It's so scary. 

882
00:33:41,841 --> 00:33:42,874
(Meanwhile,  Yeonwoo) 

883
00:33:42,874 --> 00:33:44,008
No. 

884
00:33:44,008 --> 00:33:46,308
I hate this. Let me off. 

885
00:33:46,308 --> 00:33:48,108
I want to get off. 

886
00:33:48,108 --> 00:33:48,741
(She starts screaming as soon as it takes off) 

887
00:33:51,174 --> 00:33:52,074
- What? / - What was that? 

888
00:33:52,074 --> 00:33:53,574
- I want to get off. / - What? 

889
00:33:54,141 --> 00:33:55,974
- What? / - What was that? 

890
00:33:55,974 --> 00:33:57,441
That was like some horror film. 

891
00:33:57,441 --> 00:33:59,208
It seems that your pupils were... 

892
00:33:59,208 --> 00:34:00,608
Let me off! 

893
00:34:00,608 --> 00:34:01,841
Your eyes have lost focus. 

894
00:34:02,374 --> 00:34:04,274
I think you can see everything. 

895
00:34:04,274 --> 00:34:07,941
I think you'll see the whole city when it spins. 

896
00:34:07,941 --> 00:34:09,874
(Yeonwoo lets go of herself) 

897
00:34:10,941 --> 00:34:13,441
I'm drawing a blank. 

898
00:34:14,874 --> 00:34:17,441
It's scary! Let me go down! 

899
00:34:18,108 --> 00:34:19,741
I know how that feels. 

900
00:34:20,008 --> 00:34:21,241
Open your eyes. 

901
00:34:21,241 --> 00:34:22,841
(It's not okay) 

902
00:34:27,041 --> 00:34:31,074
(Shivering) 

903
00:34:32,808 --> 00:34:34,208
I hate that. 

904
00:34:34,208 --> 00:34:36,174
(It's spinning slowly at 35m high) 

905
00:34:36,174 --> 00:34:38,274
I want to try it. It looks nice. 

906
00:34:38,274 --> 00:34:39,508
You're lying. 

907
00:34:39,508 --> 00:34:40,708
- It's higher than the Ferris wheel. / - It's slow. 

908
00:34:40,708 --> 00:34:42,108
The view is so pretty. 

909
00:34:42,108 --> 00:34:44,141
It's spinning slowly. It's not that scary. 

910
00:34:44,141 --> 00:34:46,574
- Yes, it's really scary. / - Come on. 

911
00:34:46,574 --> 00:34:49,208
It's really scary but it's really beautiful. 

912
00:34:49,208 --> 00:34:52,108
I feel like my shoes are going to come off. 

913
00:34:52,841 --> 00:34:55,741
I'm holding tightly onto my shoes. They might fall off! 

914
00:34:56,574 --> 00:34:58,541
(She's gotten used to it and is taking pictures now) 

915
00:34:58,541 --> 00:34:59,608
Gosh. 

916
00:34:59,608 --> 00:35:01,341
She's taking pictures. 

917
00:35:01,341 --> 00:35:02,508
How can you take pictures? 

918
00:35:03,574 --> 00:35:05,808
(It speeds up as it comes down) 

919
00:35:05,808 --> 00:35:07,174
- It's going faster. / - Gosh. 

920
00:35:08,374 --> 00:35:09,841
(The swing goes out farther) 

921
00:35:09,841 --> 00:35:12,874
Oh, my God. 

922
00:35:14,208 --> 00:35:16,074
Birds! Why are they coming here? 

923
00:35:16,974 --> 00:35:18,874
(Birds fly by) 

924
00:35:18,874 --> 00:35:20,074
Even the birds avoid it. 

925
00:35:22,141 --> 00:35:23,308
Even the birds avoid it. 

926
00:35:24,908 --> 00:35:26,808
That's funny. 

927
00:35:26,808 --> 00:35:28,174
(Jooe's video) 

928
00:35:28,174 --> 00:35:30,041
Birds! 

929
00:35:30,041 --> 00:35:31,441
- Why are they coming here? / - So close. 

930
00:35:32,108 --> 00:35:34,174
The birds are greeting you. 

931
00:35:35,008 --> 00:35:36,108
I was so surprised. 

932
00:35:36,108 --> 00:35:37,141
I'm scared! 

933
00:35:37,141 --> 00:35:38,674
Look at the beautiful foliage. 

934
00:35:38,674 --> 00:35:41,308
That's scary. 

935
00:35:41,308 --> 00:35:43,141
That's scary. 

936
00:35:43,141 --> 00:35:44,274
It must be scary. 

937
00:35:47,041 --> 00:35:49,108
(It's so scary) 

938
00:35:49,108 --> 00:35:50,341
I'm scared. 

939
00:35:51,308 --> 00:35:53,608
My shoes are going to fall off. 

940
00:35:53,608 --> 00:35:57,041
(It lands after 4 minutes) 

941
00:35:58,808 --> 00:35:59,908
(She's totally out of it) 

942
00:35:59,908 --> 00:36:01,008
What is this? 

943
00:36:03,774 --> 00:36:07,408
(Jooe must've been scared too) 

944
00:36:07,408 --> 00:36:08,608
That... 

945
00:36:08,608 --> 00:36:09,841
She's crying. 

946
00:36:09,841 --> 00:36:12,008
The ride was too long. 

947
00:36:12,841 --> 00:36:15,774
I think you should ride it even if it's scary. 

948
00:36:15,774 --> 00:36:17,241
Women can ride it. 

949
00:36:17,241 --> 00:36:18,274
- Right? / - Yes. 

950
00:36:18,274 --> 00:36:19,974
(Legs give out) 

951
00:36:19,974 --> 00:36:22,141
(Her legs too) 

952
00:36:22,141 --> 00:36:23,141
I'm sorry. 

953
00:36:24,508 --> 00:36:26,508
Your legs give out when you ride something scary. 

954
00:36:26,508 --> 00:36:28,941
- Yeah. / - I think I lost my voice. 

955
00:36:30,541 --> 00:36:32,174
I screamed too much. 

956
00:36:32,608 --> 00:36:34,808
I'll take you to a place... 

957
00:36:35,608 --> 00:36:39,341
Where we can calm our excited and scared feelings. 

958
00:36:40,041 --> 00:36:42,441
- Worse place than here? / - You can trust me. 

959
00:36:42,441 --> 00:36:44,008
You can really trust me. 

960
00:36:44,008 --> 00:36:45,141
I'm sorry. 

961
00:36:45,141 --> 00:36:47,074
(I sincerely apologize) 

962
00:36:47,074 --> 00:36:48,608
I haven't heard you say sorry 

963
00:36:48,608 --> 00:36:50,474
so sincerely in 3 years. 

964
00:36:50,474 --> 00:36:51,441
Let's go. 

965
00:36:53,974 --> 00:36:55,708
(Sun sets in Sakhalin) 

966
00:36:55,708 --> 00:36:56,808
That's beautiful. 

967
00:36:57,174 --> 00:36:58,641
The red sunset. 

968
00:36:58,641 --> 00:37:00,541
(They go to their next destination) 

969
00:37:02,008 --> 00:37:03,241
(Moa Moa Tour, Jooe's Downtown Tour) 

970
00:37:03,241 --> 00:37:07,174
(Korean fusion cuisine) 

971
00:37:07,174 --> 00:37:09,541
It's quiet and empty. 

972
00:37:09,541 --> 00:37:12,208
- I felt like I was there alone. / - I see. 

973
00:37:12,208 --> 00:37:13,908
That's very charming. 

974
00:37:13,908 --> 00:37:17,341
(11 minutes by car to the restaurant) 

975
00:37:17,341 --> 00:37:19,041
Seriously, it's really special. 

976
00:37:19,641 --> 00:37:20,974
- How is it special? / - We had... 

977
00:37:20,974 --> 00:37:24,141
- A Russian style lunch. / - Yes. 

978
00:37:24,141 --> 00:37:25,674
This time, 

979
00:37:25,674 --> 00:37:30,974
it's a combination of Korean and Russian food. 

980
00:37:30,974 --> 00:37:34,174
It's a fusion cuisine. 

981
00:37:34,174 --> 00:37:35,874
I'm so excited. 

982
00:37:36,308 --> 00:37:38,508
Let's go in and eat. 

983
00:37:38,508 --> 00:37:40,208
It's called Leto. 

984
00:37:40,208 --> 00:37:43,174
- It means summer in Russian. / - It's beautiful. 

985
00:37:45,208 --> 00:37:47,374
(It looks like they wouldn't serve Korean food) 

986
00:37:47,374 --> 00:37:49,208
It's a fancy restaurant. 

987
00:37:49,208 --> 00:37:51,541
It doesn't look like a Korean restaurant. 

988
00:37:51,541 --> 00:37:53,308
- What's that? Is it kimchi stew? / - Kimchi stew? 

989
00:37:53,308 --> 00:37:54,408
That looks familiar. 

990
00:37:55,808 --> 00:37:58,308
Sakhalin people came up with 

991
00:37:58,308 --> 00:38:01,608
their style of fusion Korean food. 

992
00:38:03,041 --> 00:38:04,341
(The locals enjoy it) 

993
00:38:04,341 --> 00:38:05,774
The locals eat it too. 

994
00:38:05,774 --> 00:38:08,741
Sakhalin people like it a lot. 

995
00:38:09,474 --> 00:38:10,841
He really seems to be enjoying it. 

996
00:38:10,841 --> 00:38:13,574
(He eats from the earthen pot) 

997
00:38:17,474 --> 00:38:19,108
- In Russia... / - Vodka! 

998
00:38:19,108 --> 00:38:20,908
They always serve the alcohol first. 

999
00:38:20,908 --> 00:38:23,041
- Russia serves alcohol first. / - Of course. 

1000
00:38:23,041 --> 00:38:24,608
- To warm you up. / - That looks good. 

1001
00:38:25,874 --> 00:38:27,308
- Cheers. / - It's cheap. 

1002
00:38:27,308 --> 00:38:28,308
Cheers. 

1003
00:38:28,308 --> 00:38:29,408
(A glass of vodka, $2.90) 

1004
00:38:29,408 --> 00:38:31,608
- Thank you. / - Thank you. 

1005
00:38:31,608 --> 00:38:34,108
(Slurping) 

1006
00:38:34,508 --> 00:38:35,608
It's good. 

1007
00:38:38,474 --> 00:38:40,941
(She doesn't look happy) 

1008
00:38:41,608 --> 00:38:43,508
They say it's not good if the alcohol is sweet. 

1009
00:38:43,508 --> 00:38:45,041
She doesn't look happy. 

1010
00:38:45,508 --> 00:38:46,608
Isn't it sweet? 

1011
00:38:48,341 --> 00:38:49,374
What's wrong? 

1012
00:38:49,374 --> 00:38:51,174
- She's only 20. / - The alcohol was too strong? 

1013
00:38:51,174 --> 00:38:52,074
Too strong? 

1014
00:38:52,274 --> 00:38:54,774
(23-year-old Yeonwoo likes it) 

1015
00:38:54,774 --> 00:38:56,174
You're good at drinking it. 

1016
00:38:56,174 --> 00:38:58,074
I think I'm drunk. 

1017
00:39:00,241 --> 00:39:02,208
- You can get drunk on Battle Trip. / - It's a work dinner! 

1018
00:39:02,208 --> 00:39:03,974
- Yes! / - I'm buying! 

1019
00:39:04,374 --> 00:39:05,908
Everyone has to order two dishes. 

1020
00:39:06,774 --> 00:39:08,374
Make sure everyone orders seasoned bracken only. 

1021
00:39:08,908 --> 00:39:11,074
(Clattering) 

1022
00:39:11,074 --> 00:39:12,408
Who just... 

1023
00:39:12,708 --> 00:39:15,374
- Who made that clattering sound? / - Dropped the fork? 

1024
00:39:15,374 --> 00:39:16,441
(Who made the clattering sound just now?) 

1025
00:39:16,441 --> 00:39:19,174
Who just coughed right now? 

1026
00:39:19,174 --> 00:39:22,508
I'm in the middle of mind reading. 

1027
00:39:22,508 --> 00:39:24,241
- "I'm reading..." / - They have great teamwork. 

1028
00:39:24,241 --> 00:39:26,474
- "Your mind, right now." / - "Your mind, right now." 

1029
00:39:27,241 --> 00:39:28,641
How do you know this? You're young. 

1030
00:39:28,641 --> 00:39:31,941
- This meme is famous online. / - Of course, we know. 

1031
00:39:31,941 --> 00:39:34,074
- "Who made that clattering sound?" / - "You fool." 

1032
00:39:34,074 --> 00:39:36,108
(This is how good MOMOLAND's teamwork is) 

1033
00:39:36,108 --> 00:39:36,941
"It was me." 

1034
00:39:36,941 --> 00:39:38,074
Wow. 

1035
00:39:38,074 --> 00:39:39,341
What's that? 

1036
00:39:39,341 --> 00:39:41,208
This feels weird. 

1037
00:39:41,208 --> 00:39:44,674
A Russian waiter is serving Korean side dishes. 

1038
00:39:44,674 --> 00:39:46,008
- This is an honor. / - It feels weird. 

1039
00:39:46,008 --> 00:39:47,041
What are the side dishes? 

1040
00:39:47,041 --> 00:39:48,074
That would feel strange. 

1041
00:39:48,074 --> 00:39:49,141
(You ought to shake the rice bowl first) 

1042
00:39:49,408 --> 00:39:50,774
- Do you know what this is? / - What? 

1043
00:39:52,274 --> 00:39:54,374
- Hey, this is white rice. / - Did you see that? 

1044
00:39:54,374 --> 00:39:54,941
What? 

1045
00:39:54,941 --> 00:39:56,074
Did you see that? 

1046
00:39:56,074 --> 00:39:57,974
- That was amazing. / - Did you see that? Try it. 

1047
00:39:58,408 --> 00:40:00,174
If you do this at a dinner party, 

1048
00:40:00,174 --> 00:40:01,441
everyone will love you. 

1049
00:40:01,441 --> 00:40:04,974
- That was cool. / - She's had many dinner parties. 

1050
00:40:04,974 --> 00:40:06,274
- Seriously. / - Hey, we won. 

1051
00:40:06,274 --> 00:40:07,108
- We won. / - We won the battle. 

1052
00:40:07,108 --> 00:40:09,741
- That's what the managers do. / - We won. 

1053
00:40:09,741 --> 00:40:11,674
- She just flipped the bowl. / - How did you do that? 

1054
00:40:11,674 --> 00:40:13,841
- That was hilarious. / - Jooe is so hilarious. 

1055
00:40:14,341 --> 00:40:15,708
- What was that? / - Seriously? 

1056
00:40:15,708 --> 00:40:17,341
I want to learn that. 

1057
00:40:18,374 --> 00:40:21,008
- This is the seasoned bracken. / - In Sakhalin... 

1058
00:40:21,008 --> 00:40:23,241
- Seasoned bracken? / - Bracken grows so well. 

1059
00:40:23,241 --> 00:40:27,274
But since they hadn't eaten or cooked this before, 

1060
00:40:27,274 --> 00:40:29,741
they had never eaten this. They didn't know how. 

1061
00:40:29,741 --> 00:40:31,908
When the Goryeo descendants 

1062
00:40:31,908 --> 00:40:33,941
began to put down roots in this region, 

1063
00:40:33,941 --> 00:40:35,808
this dish suddenly became popular. 

1064
00:40:35,808 --> 00:40:36,541
They learned to eat it. 

1065
00:40:36,541 --> 00:40:37,641
The seasoned bracken is delicious. 

1066
00:40:37,641 --> 00:40:39,241
There must be many dishes 

1067
00:40:39,241 --> 00:40:41,074
Koreans established after going over. 

1068
00:40:41,074 --> 00:40:42,474
Yes, there are a lot. 

1069
00:40:45,474 --> 00:40:46,508
This reminds me of my mom. 

1070
00:40:47,774 --> 00:40:50,674
This bracken tastes softer than the one in Korea. 

1071
00:40:51,308 --> 00:40:52,908
It's not tough at all. 

1072
00:40:52,908 --> 00:40:55,008
- It's really soft. / - It is. 

1073
00:40:55,008 --> 00:40:57,008
- How did they cook this? / - It's the softest I've had. 

1074
00:40:57,308 --> 00:41:00,341
- This restaurant is good. / - It's pretty good. 

1075
00:41:00,641 --> 00:41:01,674
The bracken. 

1076
00:41:01,674 --> 00:41:03,874
(Even picky Yeonwoo eats more) 

1077
00:41:04,374 --> 00:41:05,641
Next up is raw fish. 

1078
00:41:06,174 --> 00:41:07,708
- No, it's not. / - Raw fish? 

1079
00:41:07,708 --> 00:41:09,441
(They'll try raw fish next?) 

1080
00:41:09,874 --> 00:41:10,974
(They marinate raw fish with vinegar in Sakhalin) 

1081
00:41:10,974 --> 00:41:13,341
- Is it spicy raw fish salad? / - They have that? 

1082
00:41:13,674 --> 00:41:16,708
Yes, it was made by the Koreans there. 

1083
00:41:16,708 --> 00:41:19,941
(Plate of raw fish, $4.80) 

1084
00:41:23,041 --> 00:41:24,374
This is delicious. 

1085
00:41:25,874 --> 00:41:27,241
It's to die for. 

1086
00:41:27,841 --> 00:41:30,341
How is it? Is it similar to the dish in Korea? 

1087
00:41:30,341 --> 00:41:31,608
- It's even better. / - Really? 

1088
00:41:31,608 --> 00:41:32,974
Seriously? 

1089
00:41:32,974 --> 00:41:38,274
They cook with fresh fish they catch that day. 

1090
00:41:38,274 --> 00:41:39,574
Raw fish is fresh there. 

1091
00:41:39,574 --> 00:41:42,541
It differs from the Korean dish. 

1092
00:41:42,541 --> 00:41:45,041
- It feels like that. / - It's so good. How should I put it? 

1093
00:41:45,041 --> 00:41:46,641
- The oil. Yes. / - The chili oil. 

1094
00:41:46,641 --> 00:41:47,874
That's a bit unique. 

1095
00:41:48,708 --> 00:41:50,974
- Koreans must eat Korean food. / - Yes. 

1096
00:41:50,974 --> 00:41:52,808
- Absolutely. / - This is very good. 

1097
00:41:53,208 --> 00:41:54,508
Let's eat the meat now. 

1098
00:41:55,041 --> 00:41:58,074
- When you travel, you crave Korean food. / - Right. 

1099
00:41:58,074 --> 00:41:59,708
This is a great place to go 

1100
00:41:59,708 --> 00:42:00,674
when you crave Korean food. 

1101
00:42:00,674 --> 00:42:01,708
That'd be perfect. 

1102
00:42:01,708 --> 00:42:03,908
(But it doesn't look like regular bulgogi) 

1103
00:42:09,608 --> 00:42:11,841
(Munching) 

1104
00:42:12,174 --> 00:42:14,374
(Yes, meat can never go wrong) 

1105
00:42:14,374 --> 00:42:16,774
- Does it taste like bulgogi? / - Yes, just like bulgogi. 

1106
00:42:16,774 --> 00:42:18,708
- It's the same. / - It is bulgogi. 

1107
00:42:18,708 --> 00:42:20,141
It's like braised short ribs. 

1108
00:42:20,141 --> 00:42:21,741
This is very different. 

1109
00:42:22,941 --> 00:42:24,674
They serve it like it's braised short ribs. 

1110
00:42:24,674 --> 00:42:26,541
I should eat bulgogi with kimchi. 

1111
00:42:26,541 --> 00:42:28,341
(She eats it with kimchi) 

1112
00:42:28,341 --> 00:42:29,608
(Bulgogi is tastier when you make a lettuce wrap) 

1113
00:42:29,608 --> 00:42:30,608
This is delicious. 

1114
00:42:31,741 --> 00:42:33,674
- It's just like Korean rice. / - Yes. 

1115
00:42:34,208 --> 00:42:35,308
I'm so happy. 

1116
00:42:37,008 --> 00:42:38,374
Is this the clam stew? 

1117
00:42:38,374 --> 00:42:40,341
- Clam stew. / - Is this the clam stew? 

1118
00:42:40,341 --> 00:42:41,308
A meal needs stew. 

1119
00:42:41,308 --> 00:42:43,674
- You need soup. / - Koreans ought to have stew... 

1120
00:42:43,674 --> 00:42:44,874
For their meals. 

1121
00:42:44,874 --> 00:42:47,174
- The clams were huge. / - Great. 

1122
00:42:54,741 --> 00:42:57,408
(Did the flavor impress her?) 

1123
00:42:59,441 --> 00:43:01,508
- This is delicious. / - What is this depth of flavors? 

1124
00:43:02,808 --> 00:43:03,908
This is so good. 

1125
00:43:03,908 --> 00:43:05,174
It's like cheese instant noodles. 

1126
00:43:05,174 --> 00:43:07,274
Exactly. This is like vongole pasta. 

1127
00:43:07,274 --> 00:43:10,174
Some add butter in kimchi stew. 

1128
00:43:10,174 --> 00:43:11,674
- That's a lot of butter. / - Some people add butter. 

1129
00:43:12,208 --> 00:43:13,274
I think that's right. 

1130
00:43:13,274 --> 00:43:15,508
I thought this would taste like soybean paste stew. 

1131
00:43:15,508 --> 00:43:18,108
- It was very creamy. / - I see. 

1132
00:43:18,741 --> 00:43:20,308
- This is good. / - It's so delicious. 

1133
00:43:20,308 --> 00:43:21,374
It's so good. 

1134
00:43:21,374 --> 00:43:24,474
- I guess it's not spicy. / - It's not spicy. It's... 

1135
00:43:25,008 --> 00:43:26,441
- Like a Western dish. / - Suji. 

1136
00:43:26,441 --> 00:43:28,774
You look like an audience member. 

1137
00:43:29,574 --> 00:43:31,208
This is getting me hooked little by little. 

1138
00:43:31,541 --> 00:43:32,941
I really want to try the clam stew. 

1139
00:43:32,941 --> 00:43:34,874
When I heard they went to Russia... 

1140
00:43:34,874 --> 00:43:36,308
- We didn't expect good food. / - Right. 

1141
00:43:36,941 --> 00:43:38,441
- That looks really good. / - It was really good. 

1142
00:43:38,441 --> 00:43:39,808
This restaurant is awesome. 

1143
00:43:42,074 --> 00:43:46,141
(Eating with gusto) 

1144
00:43:53,241 --> 00:43:55,841
(Their hands are moving ceaselessly) 

1145
00:43:56,208 --> 00:43:57,874
Kimchi, thank you. 

1146
00:43:57,874 --> 00:43:59,074
(It translates to "more kimchi, please") 

1147
00:44:01,474 --> 00:44:03,174
Can you get a refill? 

1148
00:44:03,174 --> 00:44:04,541
- No, you pay for kimchi. / - You have to pay for it. 

1149
00:44:04,541 --> 00:44:05,574
You have to pay extra, right? 

1150
00:44:05,574 --> 00:44:08,041
- It's 8 cents to get a refill. / - What? 

1151
00:44:08,708 --> 00:44:10,374
- 8 cents? / - Yes, 8 cents. 

1152
00:44:10,374 --> 00:44:14,841
(They keep on eating after getting more kimchi) 

1153
00:44:15,841 --> 00:44:17,708
Yeonwoo, what did you think about today's trip? 

1154
00:44:17,708 --> 00:44:19,474
I really enjoyed my time today. 

1155
00:44:19,474 --> 00:44:21,374
- Really? What was your favorite? / - Yes. 

1156
00:44:21,374 --> 00:44:22,908
The honey beer... 

1157
00:44:22,908 --> 00:44:25,874
(They're still thinking about the honey beer) 

1158
00:44:25,874 --> 00:44:27,874
You don't mean that. You finished the vodka too. 

1159
00:44:27,874 --> 00:44:29,841
Exactly. Let me order one more. 

1160
00:44:30,774 --> 00:44:33,074
Tomorrow, we're going to travel far. 

1161
00:44:33,074 --> 00:44:35,908
We'll go to the outskirts to experience Mother Nature. 

1162
00:44:36,708 --> 00:44:38,108
I love it. 

1163
00:44:38,108 --> 00:44:41,441
(She smoothly takes Jooe's vodka) 

1164
00:44:41,441 --> 00:44:43,908
Time out. I think Yeonwoo is drunk. 

1165
00:44:43,908 --> 00:44:45,241
She's drunk. 

1166
00:44:45,241 --> 00:44:48,408
- Yeonwoo's future seems promising. / - Drunk. 

1167
00:44:48,408 --> 00:44:49,841
(He looks forward to Yeonwoo's future) 

1168
00:44:49,841 --> 00:44:50,874
- Is that so? / - She's a drinker. 

1169
00:44:50,874 --> 00:44:52,308
- They're going to the ocean now. / - She can't drink. 

1170
00:44:53,374 --> 00:44:55,841
(Today, it's the outskirts of Sakhalin) 

1171
00:44:56,041 --> 00:44:58,174
I'm going to head out to the outskirts. 

1172
00:44:58,174 --> 00:45:00,008
I can't make you wait. 

1173
00:45:00,008 --> 00:45:02,474
Let's go. 

1174
00:45:03,308 --> 00:45:04,241
Yeonwoo, you look cool today. 

1175
00:45:04,241 --> 00:45:05,974
I'll trust Lee Dabin today. 

1176
00:45:05,974 --> 00:45:07,941
(Racing hard) 

1177
00:45:07,941 --> 00:45:09,774
It's the ocean! 

1178
00:45:09,774 --> 00:45:11,608
The ocean looks amazing. 

1179
00:45:11,608 --> 00:45:13,108
It's so pretty. 

1180
00:45:13,808 --> 00:45:15,474
We caught these without any bait. 

1181
00:45:15,474 --> 00:45:17,308
- We caught some! / - Yeah. 

1182
00:45:18,808 --> 00:45:20,308
I can't believe that! 

1183
00:45:20,308 --> 00:45:21,141
What is that? 

1184
00:45:21,141 --> 00:45:24,408
- We caught some! / - Yeah. 

1185
00:45:24,408 --> 00:45:26,841
(Every line they throw, they get a catch) 

1186
00:45:26,841 --> 00:45:28,741
Feed me! Feed me! 

1187
00:45:29,708 --> 00:45:32,874
(This crab is on a whole new level) 

1188
00:45:32,874 --> 00:45:34,308
Give me one more crab, please. 

1189
00:45:36,708 --> 00:45:39,608
- We did it. This is it. / - No, no. 

1190
00:45:39,608 --> 00:45:42,441
(This crab is on a whole new level) 

1191
00:45:42,441 --> 00:45:44,008
- We did it. This is it. / - One more crab, please. 

1192
00:45:44,008 --> 00:45:45,108
- No, no. / - We won. 

1193
00:45:45,108 --> 00:45:47,174
- It's really delicious. / - We won. It's over. 

1194
00:45:48,141 --> 00:45:49,974
- We did it. We did it. / - Today was incredible. 

1195
00:45:49,974 --> 00:45:52,841
- Yeonwoo's Day! / - Moa Moa Tour! 

1196
00:45:52,841 --> 00:45:54,408
It's Yeonwoo's Day! 

1197
00:45:54,408 --> 00:45:57,494
- Yeonwoo's Day! / - Moa Moa Tour! 

1198
00:45:57,494 --> 00:45:59,928
We're going to the outskirts. 

1199
00:45:59,928 --> 00:46:01,728
I can't make you wait. 

1200
00:46:01,728 --> 00:46:04,294
- Let's go. / - Go! 

1201
00:46:04,961 --> 00:46:05,861
Yeonwoo, you look cool today. 

1202
00:46:05,861 --> 00:46:07,794
I'll trust Lee Dabin today. 

1203
00:46:09,794 --> 00:46:11,694
It's the ocean. 

1204
00:46:13,094 --> 00:46:14,894
That's what we expected. 

1205
00:46:15,528 --> 00:46:19,028
- We fished without bait. / - Caught them! 

1206
00:46:19,028 --> 00:46:20,061
We caught them. 

1207
00:46:20,061 --> 00:46:21,894
I can't believe that! 

1208
00:46:21,894 --> 00:46:22,994
What is that? 

1209
00:46:22,994 --> 00:46:25,394
- We caught them. / - Caught them! 

1210
00:46:25,394 --> 00:46:28,594
(Every line they throw, they get a catch) 

1211
00:46:28,594 --> 00:46:30,661
Feed me! Feed me! 

1212
00:46:31,128 --> 00:46:34,561
(This crab is on a whole new level) 

1213
00:46:34,561 --> 00:46:35,861
Give me one more crab, please. 

1214
00:46:38,328 --> 00:46:41,061
- We did it. This is it. / - No, no. 

1215
00:46:41,061 --> 00:46:44,194
(This crab is on a whole new level) 

1216
00:46:44,194 --> 00:46:45,794
- We did it. This is it. / - One more crab, please. 

1217
00:46:45,794 --> 00:46:47,128
- No, no. / - We won. 

1218
00:46:47,128 --> 00:46:49,061
- We won. It's over. / - King crab. 

1219
00:46:49,861 --> 00:46:51,494
- Today was incredible. / - We did it. We did it. 

1220
00:46:51,494 --> 00:46:54,694
- Yeonwoo's Day. / - Moa Moa Tour! 

1221
00:46:56,328 --> 00:46:57,561
(The second day of Moa Moa Tour) 

1222
00:46:57,561 --> 00:46:59,128
Good morning. 

1223
00:46:59,128 --> 00:47:00,694
- Good morning. / - Good morning. 

1224
00:47:00,694 --> 00:47:04,561
(They're already in a good mood this morning) 

1225
00:47:05,094 --> 00:47:06,861
We have to travel to this place first. 

1226
00:47:06,861 --> 00:47:08,294
We're heading to the outskirts. 

1227
00:47:08,294 --> 00:47:10,928
- We're going to the outskirts. / - Okay. 

1228
00:47:10,928 --> 00:47:14,394
In Russia, people carpool like a taxi. 

1229
00:47:14,394 --> 00:47:17,028
You have to call the vehicle with an app 

1230
00:47:17,028 --> 00:47:18,761
but I already did that. 

1231
00:47:19,661 --> 00:47:22,761
I can't let you wait. You mean so much to me. 

1232
00:47:23,428 --> 00:47:25,861
Where are we going via taxi? 

1233
00:47:25,861 --> 00:47:29,161
We're going to a place with a rich... 

1234
00:47:29,161 --> 00:47:31,028
- And long history. / - History? 

1235
00:47:31,028 --> 00:47:32,094
(This place comes with historical significance) 

1236
00:47:32,094 --> 00:47:35,128
This comes up first when I look up Sakhalin online. 

1237
00:47:35,128 --> 00:47:36,261
Monument at the Mountain Pechali. 

1238
00:47:36,261 --> 00:47:38,694
I think we must go to this place. 

1239
00:47:40,128 --> 00:47:41,128
What is that? 

1240
00:47:41,128 --> 00:47:43,394
It represents the longing for one's hometown. 

1241
00:47:43,394 --> 00:47:45,961
(Mountain Pechali Monument) 

1242
00:47:46,528 --> 00:47:47,528
Let's go! 

1243
00:47:48,561 --> 00:47:51,294
Let's go. 

1244
00:47:52,361 --> 00:47:56,128
Other than historical sites... 

1245
00:47:56,828 --> 00:47:58,094
Where else are we going? 

1246
00:47:58,094 --> 00:48:01,294
I prepared something exciting for you. 

1247
00:48:01,294 --> 00:48:02,828
- Something exciting? / - Yes. 

1248
00:48:02,828 --> 00:48:05,494
We're going to the outskirts and see Mother Nature. 

1249
00:48:05,494 --> 00:48:06,928
Mother Nature. 

1250
00:48:07,928 --> 00:48:13,128
(The view from the car changes to nature) 

1251
00:48:14,161 --> 00:48:18,428
(50 minutes by car from hotel to the monument) 

1252
00:48:18,594 --> 00:48:21,361
We're now in nature. 

1253
00:48:21,361 --> 00:48:23,761
We are. It's Mother Nature. 

1254
00:48:23,761 --> 00:48:25,461
Where are we? What is this called? 

1255
00:48:25,461 --> 00:48:26,728
- It's a port. / - A port. 

1256
00:48:26,728 --> 00:48:29,028
A long time ago, during Japanese ruling, 

1257
00:48:29,028 --> 00:48:32,061
Koreans were forced to come to Sakhalin through 

1258
00:48:32,061 --> 00:48:33,694
the Port of Korsakov. 

1259
00:48:33,694 --> 00:48:36,794
They had a chance to go back to Korea. 

1260
00:48:37,128 --> 00:48:40,894
But because of the bad situation, 

1261
00:48:40,894 --> 00:48:43,894
a lot of them couldn't come back to Korea. 

1262
00:48:43,894 --> 00:48:45,694
So that's where it is. 

1263
00:48:45,694 --> 00:48:49,228
A monument is built here to remember the sadness. 

1264
00:48:49,228 --> 00:48:50,994
It's called Monument at the Mountain Pechali. 

1265
00:48:50,994 --> 00:48:51,894
Let's go. 

1266
00:48:51,894 --> 00:48:53,461
I didn't know about this. 

1267
00:48:54,328 --> 00:48:55,628
Is this the monument? 

1268
00:48:55,628 --> 00:48:56,728
Yes, it is. 

1269
00:48:58,128 --> 00:49:06,028
(The monument is right next to Port of Korsakov) 

1270
00:49:10,894 --> 00:49:14,128
(The ship won't come) 

1271
00:49:14,128 --> 00:49:15,894
(They waited for the ship) 

1272
00:49:15,894 --> 00:49:22,861
(That will take them back to their home country) 

1273
00:49:23,894 --> 00:49:27,661
(Full of the feelings of longing and resentment) 

1274
00:49:27,661 --> 00:49:30,828
From here, you can see the whole Port of Korsakov. 

1275
00:49:33,261 --> 00:49:34,994
It must be very sad to be there. 

1276
00:49:34,994 --> 00:49:38,828
(It was built to honor the Koreans missing home) 

1277
00:49:38,828 --> 00:49:41,428
The name of this monument... 

1278
00:49:41,428 --> 00:49:43,228
- It's very sad. / - Is so very sad. 

1279
00:49:43,694 --> 00:49:46,694
I'm sure both of you will never forget this experience. 

1280
00:49:46,694 --> 00:49:48,028
- For sure. / - You're right. 

1281
00:49:49,394 --> 00:49:51,961
(The ship won't come, they waited and waited) 

1282
00:49:51,961 --> 00:49:54,828
It's such a sad story. 

1283
00:49:56,694 --> 00:49:59,561
So they kept waiting here. 

1284
00:49:59,561 --> 00:50:03,294
Exactly. They kept waiting here for the ship to come 

1285
00:50:03,294 --> 00:50:05,894
but the ship never came. 

1286
00:50:05,894 --> 00:50:10,094
(They waited for the ship that will take them home) 

1287
00:50:10,094 --> 00:50:14,728
We almost didn't know that this existed in Sakhalin. 

1288
00:50:14,728 --> 00:50:16,728
- That's true. / - I hope after our visit... 

1289
00:50:16,728 --> 00:50:19,361
More people take interest and 

1290
00:50:19,361 --> 00:50:23,394
remember the sad history and mourn together. 

1291
00:50:23,761 --> 00:50:27,528
Although we're on this trip to have fun, 

1292
00:50:27,528 --> 00:50:31,328
I thought it would be nice to 

1293
00:50:31,328 --> 00:50:33,794
learn about the history too. 

1294
00:50:33,794 --> 00:50:35,394
That's why I brought you here. 

1295
00:50:36,428 --> 00:50:37,561
You're... 

1296
00:50:39,228 --> 00:50:40,728
So cool, Yeonwoo. 

1297
00:50:41,694 --> 00:50:44,694
You're so cool. 

1298
00:50:44,694 --> 00:50:47,428
Should I trust Lee Dabin today? 

1299
00:50:48,328 --> 00:50:50,328
It was a good idea to take you to this place first. 

1300
00:50:50,328 --> 00:50:52,228
- I can rely on you. / - I made you trust me. 

1301
00:50:52,228 --> 00:50:55,928
(Where is the next destination?) 

1302
00:50:56,861 --> 00:50:58,028
(Moa Moa Tour, Yeonwoo's Outskirts Tour) 

1303
00:50:58,028 --> 00:50:59,728
(All-terrain vehicle) 

1304
00:50:59,728 --> 00:51:02,461
- ATV! / - I want to try that too. 

1305
00:51:03,061 --> 00:51:05,361
(10 minutes from Monument at the Mountain Pechali) 

1306
00:51:05,361 --> 00:51:07,594
It was only a 10-minute ride. It was very close. 

1307
00:51:07,594 --> 00:51:09,894
- I love the proximity. / - It's really close. 

1308
00:51:09,894 --> 00:51:10,894
It is. 

1309
00:51:11,494 --> 00:51:12,928
It's a sports center? 

1310
00:51:12,928 --> 00:51:15,294
It kind of feels like Jeju-do. 

1311
00:51:15,294 --> 00:51:16,761
- It really does. / - Don't you think so? 

1312
00:51:17,561 --> 00:51:20,194
- So many activities. / - I wanted to ride a light aircraft. 

1313
00:51:21,328 --> 00:51:23,461
It's a shame we didn't get to ride one. 

1314
00:51:23,994 --> 00:51:27,828
We're very used to this vehicle. 

1315
00:51:27,828 --> 00:51:28,728
We've ridden it before. 

1316
00:51:28,728 --> 00:51:31,861
I wanted to do something I've done before. 

1317
00:51:31,861 --> 00:51:34,261
We're going to ride an all-terrain vehicle. 

1318
00:51:34,261 --> 00:51:36,328
It's not a regular all-terrain vehicle. 

1319
00:51:36,328 --> 00:51:37,628
It's a monster all-terrain vehicle. 

1320
00:51:37,628 --> 00:51:39,928
- Monster? / - It's a 550cc ATV. 

1321
00:51:39,928 --> 00:51:41,594
- 550cc? / - 550cc? 

1322
00:51:41,594 --> 00:51:43,128
That must be really fast. 

1323
00:51:43,128 --> 00:51:47,394
(Russian activities are on a whole different level) 

1324
00:51:47,928 --> 00:51:51,194
(A monster ATV) 

1325
00:51:51,194 --> 00:51:53,261
It was really big. 

1326
00:51:53,261 --> 00:51:54,761
It was very fast as well. 

1327
00:51:54,761 --> 00:51:58,161
(You can see the landscape of Sakhalin) 

1328
00:51:59,328 --> 00:52:00,628
(It's the best activity to properly feel Mother Nature) 

1329
00:52:00,628 --> 00:52:02,328
550cc? 

1330
00:52:03,028 --> 00:52:04,328
It's almost as powerful as a car. 

1331
00:52:04,861 --> 00:52:06,128
- It's like a car. / - It was very fast too. 

1332
00:52:06,128 --> 00:52:08,428
- A small car is... / - About 600cc. 

1333
00:52:08,428 --> 00:52:11,928
- Right? / - Most all-terrain vehicles are 125cc. 

1334
00:52:12,194 --> 00:52:13,694
It's really big. 

1335
00:52:13,694 --> 00:52:14,928
It must be very fast. 

1336
00:52:14,928 --> 00:52:16,961
- You should learn properly. / - It sounds different. 

1337
00:52:16,961 --> 00:52:19,561
(They get thorough 1 on 1 lessons) 

1338
00:52:20,294 --> 00:52:22,294
- It sounds grand. / - It was very safe. 

1339
00:52:22,294 --> 00:52:25,061
Can you ride it without a driving license? 

1340
00:52:25,061 --> 00:52:26,728
- Yes, you can. / - Without a driving license? 

1341
00:52:27,628 --> 00:52:29,628
Anyone can ride it after a safety course. 

1342
00:52:30,061 --> 00:52:33,128
(They're ready) 

1343
00:52:33,428 --> 00:52:36,428
(For safety, a guide will be driving with them) 

1344
00:52:37,194 --> 00:52:42,328
(Finally, they take off) 

1345
00:52:44,494 --> 00:52:48,128
(The two drive into Sakhalin's nature) 

1346
00:52:48,494 --> 00:52:50,861
Men would love this. 

1347
00:52:50,861 --> 00:52:52,161
Men would go crazy. 

1348
00:52:52,161 --> 00:52:55,361
Since it's big and powerful, it's fun riding it. 

1349
00:52:55,361 --> 00:52:56,928
- I can imagine. / - It feels really good. 

1350
00:52:56,928 --> 00:52:58,461
- I'm a genius. / - It was really nice. 

1351
00:52:59,128 --> 00:53:01,528
It feels so nice. I want to keep driving. 

1352
00:53:02,328 --> 00:53:03,261
(Jooe on the other hand) 

1353
00:53:03,261 --> 00:53:04,661
I'm scared. 

1354
00:53:07,394 --> 00:53:10,894
(She's driving as slow as possible) 

1355
00:53:10,894 --> 00:53:13,228
(A very big puddle) 

1356
00:53:13,228 --> 00:53:15,028
You should drive on it and splash the water. 

1357
00:53:15,028 --> 00:53:17,028
You have to just drive through that. 

1358
00:53:17,028 --> 00:53:19,828
- Yeonwoo was such a good driver. / - Really? 

1359
00:53:19,828 --> 00:53:22,461
(Jooe is slowly getting used to it) 

1360
00:53:25,028 --> 00:53:26,928
It's a big road. 

1361
00:53:26,928 --> 00:53:30,161
(It's an open road that is nice to drive on) 

1362
00:53:30,161 --> 00:53:32,328
My gosh. It feels so good! 

1363
00:53:32,328 --> 00:53:33,794
This feels awesome. 

1364
00:53:33,794 --> 00:53:35,961
This part was the best. 

1365
00:53:35,961 --> 00:53:37,094
Go, Yeonwoo! 

1366
00:53:37,094 --> 00:53:40,161
There are a lot of open places here. 

1367
00:53:40,161 --> 00:53:43,028
- We could feel nature. / - Go, Dabin. 

1368
00:53:43,728 --> 00:53:46,061
(They aren't afraid of puddles anymore) 

1369
00:53:46,061 --> 00:53:47,694
Let's go! 

1370
00:53:47,694 --> 00:53:48,794
(They speed up) 

1371
00:53:49,861 --> 00:53:51,861
(They speed along the road, overcoming the fear) 

1372
00:53:53,361 --> 00:53:55,094
- Jooe! / - You're driving to the ocean? 

1373
00:53:55,094 --> 00:53:56,161
- Yes. / - Yes. 

1374
00:54:01,561 --> 00:54:06,661
(They stop at the highlight of the place) 

1375
00:54:07,328 --> 00:54:09,228
It's so pretty. It's beautiful. 

1376
00:54:09,228 --> 00:54:10,794
- What is this? / - Is it a lake? 

1377
00:54:10,794 --> 00:54:11,828
A lake? 

1378
00:54:13,428 --> 00:54:15,228
- It is a lake. / - A lake? 

1379
00:54:15,228 --> 00:54:16,261
Yes, it's a lake. 

1380
00:54:16,261 --> 00:54:17,628
It looks gorgeous. 

1381
00:54:17,628 --> 00:54:18,961
Behind the lake is the sea. 

1382
00:54:18,961 --> 00:54:19,961
(Sakhalin's nature down the mountainside) 

1383
00:54:20,528 --> 00:54:22,161
It looks amazing. 

1384
00:54:22,161 --> 00:54:23,628
It's really beautiful. 

1385
00:54:26,728 --> 00:54:27,561
(A satisfying and clear view) 

1386
00:54:27,561 --> 00:54:30,194
Thanks to the long, straight road... 

1387
00:54:30,194 --> 00:54:32,294
- And the flat land... / - You're right. 

1388
00:54:32,294 --> 00:54:34,128
We could leisurely 

1389
00:54:34,128 --> 00:54:36,128
see the beautiful view of nature. 

1390
00:54:36,128 --> 00:54:37,761
- I loved it. / - I loved it too. 

1391
00:54:37,761 --> 00:54:40,028
- I mean it. / - I think... 

1392
00:54:40,361 --> 00:54:43,228
- I should buy one back to Korea. / - What? 

1393
00:54:43,228 --> 00:54:45,161
I think I should buy one. 

1394
00:54:45,161 --> 00:54:48,428
Yeonwoo, now that we've seen this beautiful sight, 

1395
00:54:48,428 --> 00:54:49,428
where are we going next? 

1396
00:54:49,428 --> 00:54:52,761
We just saw the ocean from a distance. 

1397
00:54:52,761 --> 00:54:54,494
Now we're going to see it from up close. 

1398
00:54:54,961 --> 00:54:56,294
I'll show you the ocean. 

1399
00:54:56,294 --> 00:54:57,494
Up close like this? 

1400
00:54:57,494 --> 00:54:59,528
Yes, it will be right before your eyes. 

1401
00:54:59,528 --> 00:55:01,361
- Like this? / - Yes, like that. 

1402
00:55:01,361 --> 00:55:04,961
I'll take you to the place. Just follow me. 

1403
00:55:04,961 --> 00:55:06,461
Let's go. 

1404
00:55:06,461 --> 00:55:09,328
- Let's go. / - Let's continue Yeonwoo Tour. 

1405
00:55:09,828 --> 00:55:13,594
- Bye, Moa Moa Tour! / - Bye, Moa Moa Tour! 

1406
00:55:16,894 --> 00:55:17,861
(Moa Moa Tour, Yeonwoo's Outskirts Tour) 

1407
00:55:17,861 --> 00:55:22,828
(Fishing) 

1408
00:55:23,261 --> 00:55:28,528
(It takes 40 minutes by car to get to the fishing place) 

1409
00:55:28,728 --> 00:55:32,961
(Okhotskoye) 

1410
00:55:32,961 --> 00:55:37,094
(It's a seaside village right next to the Sea of Okhotsk) 

1411
00:55:37,094 --> 00:55:38,794
- The Sea of Okhotsk? / - So this is where you'll fish. 

1412
00:55:38,794 --> 00:55:41,294
- There must be a lot of fish there. / - At the beach? 

1413
00:55:41,294 --> 00:55:42,594
There were a lot of fish. 

1414
00:55:43,628 --> 00:55:45,694
How many fish will you catch? 

1415
00:55:45,694 --> 00:55:49,128
I'll catch 3 fish in 10 minutes. 

1416
00:55:49,128 --> 00:55:51,061
- Here... / - How is that possible? 

1417
00:55:51,061 --> 00:55:52,994
Of course it's possible. I... 

1418
00:55:52,994 --> 00:55:54,128
You what? 

1419
00:55:54,461 --> 00:55:55,994
- I... / - Nothing to say? 

1420
00:55:55,994 --> 00:55:57,761
My fists are on fire. 

1421
00:55:57,761 --> 00:55:59,394
- What fist? / - I catch fish with my fist. 

1422
00:56:00,128 --> 00:56:01,128
Will you punch water like this? 

1423
00:56:01,128 --> 00:56:03,361
Exactly. If I punch the water like this, fish will pop up. 

1424
00:56:03,761 --> 00:56:07,194
Let's go. You'll see once we get there. 

1425
00:56:07,194 --> 00:56:08,194
(Screaming) 

1426
00:56:08,194 --> 00:56:09,661
You scared me. 

1427
00:56:09,661 --> 00:56:13,128
(What did she see?) 

1428
00:56:13,361 --> 00:56:14,328
What's up? 

1429
00:56:15,428 --> 00:56:16,861
There are so many fish. 

1430
00:56:17,861 --> 00:56:19,328
- What are they? / - There are so many of them. 

1431
00:56:19,328 --> 00:56:21,761
- They are... / - They're salmons. 

1432
00:56:21,761 --> 00:56:23,528
- Are they salmon? / - I've only seen this on TV. 

1433
00:56:23,528 --> 00:56:25,394
- Are the black things all fish? / - Yes. 

1434
00:56:25,728 --> 00:56:27,961
- They're swimming upstream. / - Oh, my. 

1435
00:56:27,961 --> 00:56:30,528
The water is so clean. 

1436
00:56:30,528 --> 00:56:32,794
Is it a river connected to the Sea of Okhotsk? 

1437
00:56:32,794 --> 00:56:35,828
- They're coming from the sea. / - I know. 

1438
00:56:35,828 --> 00:56:37,128
They're going to lay eggs. 

1439
00:56:37,128 --> 00:56:39,561
It's breeding season, so they're swimming upstream 

1440
00:56:39,561 --> 00:56:41,328
to lay eggs. 

1441
00:56:42,194 --> 00:56:44,894
(They're salmon from the Sea of Okhotsk) 

1442
00:56:44,894 --> 00:56:47,161
- You're now watching salmon... / - Salmon! 

1443
00:56:47,161 --> 00:56:49,928
Swimming upstream to lay eggs. 

1444
00:56:49,928 --> 00:56:51,261
(The salmon swim back to the river they were born in) 

1445
00:56:51,261 --> 00:56:54,461
I can feel their maternal love. 

1446
00:56:55,294 --> 00:56:56,494
Go, mothers! 

1447
00:56:56,494 --> 00:56:58,494
- Go, mothers. / - Keep it up. 

1448
00:56:59,194 --> 00:57:00,794
Let's go fishing now. 

1449
00:57:00,794 --> 00:57:04,028
You can't see this anywhere. 

1450
00:57:10,794 --> 00:57:15,661
(They get on a boat on the beach) 

1451
00:57:15,761 --> 00:57:17,261
Here I come! 

1452
00:57:18,828 --> 00:57:21,461
I wonder how much the boat ride costs. 

1453
00:57:22,128 --> 00:57:24,094
Boat rides are usually expensive. 

1454
00:57:24,094 --> 00:57:25,094
(They sail toward the ocean) 

1455
00:57:25,094 --> 00:57:26,461
It feels nice. 

1456
00:57:27,661 --> 00:57:29,494
A half day boat tour is $100? 

1457
00:57:29,494 --> 00:57:31,228
- Yes, it's a half day tour. / - Per person? 

1458
00:57:31,228 --> 00:57:34,094
- Actually, I've fished before. / - Have you? 

1459
00:57:34,094 --> 00:57:36,061
I don't have much experience in ocean fishing. 

1460
00:57:36,061 --> 00:57:39,161
- But I went fishing with my dad. / - Really? 

1461
00:57:39,161 --> 00:57:41,028
- So I wanted to do it with Jooe. / - I see. 

1462
00:57:41,194 --> 00:57:44,394
- It's perfect weather, not too cold. / - Yeah. 

1463
00:57:44,394 --> 00:57:46,428
I like the sunshine. 

1464
00:57:46,428 --> 00:57:48,528
- It's getting warmer. / - This is beautiful. 

1465
00:57:48,528 --> 00:57:49,694
This is great. 

1466
00:57:49,694 --> 00:57:51,894
(The captain tells them something) 

1467
00:57:53,828 --> 00:57:56,861
(He points at something) 

1468
00:57:57,528 --> 00:58:00,461
- Why? / - You can swim in the ocean in summer. 

1469
00:58:00,461 --> 00:58:02,694
- My gosh. / - Gosh, this is amazing. 

1470
00:58:02,694 --> 00:58:04,228
- What is that? / - Gosh, this is amazing. 

1471
00:58:04,228 --> 00:58:05,761
- Why? / - It's a seal. 

1472
00:58:05,761 --> 00:58:06,928
- What? / - A seal? 

1473
00:58:06,928 --> 00:58:08,528
- Seal? / - Seal? 

1474
00:58:08,528 --> 00:58:10,328
- Seals were looking at us. / - It's seals. 

1475
00:58:10,328 --> 00:58:11,328
Where? 

1476
00:58:11,328 --> 00:58:13,261
- They were so cute. / - So cute. 

1477
00:58:13,261 --> 00:58:15,128
- Look at that. / - They are seals. 

1478
00:58:15,128 --> 00:58:16,328
They all are seals? 

1479
00:58:16,328 --> 00:58:17,661
- They are true seals. / - True seals. 

1480
00:58:18,494 --> 00:58:19,928
My goodness. 

1481
00:58:19,928 --> 00:58:21,528
They are true seals. 

1482
00:58:21,528 --> 00:58:22,594
Spotted seals? 

1483
00:58:22,594 --> 00:58:23,694
They're so cute. 

1484
00:58:24,294 --> 00:58:26,028
- They look so cute. / - So cute. 

1485
00:58:26,028 --> 00:58:27,161
That's so funny. 

1486
00:58:27,161 --> 00:58:28,761
- They're so cute. / - They are watching people. 

1487
00:58:28,761 --> 00:58:31,428
- They are seals. / - They're watching you. 

1488
00:58:31,428 --> 00:58:33,261
- They were watching us. / - Right. 

1489
00:58:33,261 --> 00:58:34,994
This is amazing. 

1490
00:58:35,528 --> 00:58:36,661
It's so cute. 

1491
00:58:37,361 --> 00:58:38,694
They are so adorable. 

1492
00:58:38,694 --> 00:58:40,194
I got goose-bumps. 

1493
00:58:40,661 --> 00:58:42,361
They are really cute. 

1494
00:58:43,094 --> 00:58:44,828
The seals are watching us. 

1495
00:58:45,361 --> 00:58:46,628
They all are like this. 

1496
00:58:46,961 --> 00:58:50,594
It feels like I'm watching a documentary. 

1497
00:58:50,594 --> 00:58:53,194
It looks like a documentary. This is amazing. 

1498
00:58:53,194 --> 00:58:57,628
We're seeing a lot of rare sights today. 

1499
00:59:01,528 --> 00:59:03,761
- Thank you. / - I'll remember this forever. 

1500
00:59:05,261 --> 00:59:07,028
- This is amazing. / - It's a wonderful experience. 

1501
00:59:07,028 --> 00:59:09,061
- It was so nice. / - They were really cute. 

1502
00:59:09,061 --> 00:59:11,061
- We don't get to see seals often. / - Right. 

1503
00:59:11,061 --> 00:59:12,694
I've never seen a true seal before. 

1504
00:59:12,694 --> 00:59:14,594
And they were watching you like this. 

1505
00:59:14,594 --> 00:59:16,828
- That was so cute. / - Dozens of seals did that. 

1506
00:59:16,828 --> 00:59:18,061
(The boat stops slowly) 

1507
00:59:18,061 --> 00:59:19,361
Are we fishing here? 

1508
00:59:20,061 --> 00:59:21,628
(They arrive at the fishing point 10 minutes later) 

1509
00:59:21,628 --> 00:59:22,861
- Fish. / - Fish. 

1510
00:59:24,161 --> 00:59:27,461
(The captain is setting the fishing rods) 

1511
00:59:27,461 --> 00:59:28,994
This is my first time fishing. 

1512
00:59:29,528 --> 00:59:31,461
(They fish without bait) 

1513
00:59:31,461 --> 00:59:33,628
- What? Only with a float? / - Without bait. 

1514
00:59:33,628 --> 00:59:35,128
I've never seen this before. 

1515
00:59:35,128 --> 00:59:37,061
- You're fishing with a lure. / - She's holding it. 

1516
00:59:37,061 --> 00:59:38,294
Fake bait. 

1517
00:59:38,294 --> 00:59:39,328
(They get the fishing rods) 

1518
00:59:39,728 --> 00:59:40,928
Yeonwoo, you know what? 

1519
00:59:40,928 --> 00:59:42,894
- Let's make a bet. / - A bet? 

1520
00:59:42,894 --> 00:59:45,794
It might be hard to fish then. 

1521
00:59:45,794 --> 00:59:47,461
You'll be surprised. 

1522
00:59:48,528 --> 00:59:50,094
Yeonwoo seems good at this. 

1523
00:59:50,328 --> 00:59:51,461
Look at her form. 

1524
00:59:51,461 --> 00:59:53,728
(They make a bet on fishing) 

1525
00:59:53,728 --> 00:59:56,828
(But their fishing rods are so calm) 

1526
00:59:57,361 --> 00:59:58,528
Are they sleeping? 

1527
00:59:58,528 --> 00:59:59,961
(I heard the fishing is good here) 

1528
00:59:59,961 --> 01:00:01,494
(Peaceful) 

1529
01:00:01,494 --> 01:00:02,994
(Jooe's rod, Yeonwoo's rod) 

1530
01:00:04,594 --> 01:00:05,861
(Surprised) 

1531
01:00:05,861 --> 01:00:08,661
(Yeonwoo's fishing rod is bending vigorously) 

1532
01:00:08,661 --> 01:00:10,328
- It's here. / - It feels heavy. 

1533
01:00:11,661 --> 01:00:14,694
(It looks quite strong) 

1534
01:00:14,694 --> 01:00:19,028
(The captain helps her) 

1535
01:00:19,028 --> 01:00:20,794
You failed to catch it because it's too heavy? 

1536
01:00:21,728 --> 01:00:22,994
It got stuck on a rock. 

1537
01:00:22,994 --> 01:00:24,428
(She feels dejected) 

1538
01:00:24,428 --> 01:00:26,928
- It can happen. / - Please edit this out. 

1539
01:00:26,928 --> 01:00:28,294
It can happen when you fish. 

1540
01:00:28,294 --> 01:00:30,661
- The fish were very strong. / - Jooe is reeling in. 

1541
01:00:30,661 --> 01:00:32,728
- What kind of fish? / - At this moment... 

1542
01:00:32,728 --> 01:00:33,728
I did a great job. 

1543
01:00:33,728 --> 01:00:34,928
Oh, really? 

1544
01:00:34,928 --> 01:00:36,661
- Is it fish? / - Did I catch it? 

1545
01:00:36,661 --> 01:00:38,961
- I was... / - The sea helped her. 

1546
01:00:38,961 --> 01:00:40,828
- I think you caught it. / - I got it! 

1547
01:00:40,828 --> 01:00:42,161
- Did you catch it? / - I got it! 

1548
01:00:42,528 --> 01:00:44,461
You're afraid of fish though. 

1549
01:00:44,928 --> 01:00:46,894
I overcame the fear... 

1550
01:00:47,494 --> 01:00:49,028
After fishing. 

1551
01:00:50,561 --> 01:00:51,161
I got it! 

1552
01:00:51,161 --> 01:00:52,661
How long did it take? 

1553
01:00:52,661 --> 01:00:53,961
- About 5 minutes. / - She caught a sea-perch. 

1554
01:00:53,961 --> 01:00:56,428
- Only 5 minutes? / - Sea-perch tastes good. 

1555
01:00:56,428 --> 01:00:58,594
She caught a sea-perch in 5 minutes? 

1556
01:00:58,594 --> 01:01:00,728
(She's catching it again?) 

1557
01:01:00,728 --> 01:01:04,361
(It feels even heavier) 

1558
01:01:04,361 --> 01:01:07,128
I got it! 

1559
01:01:07,128 --> 01:01:08,228
- Who is it? / - It's Jooe. 

1560
01:01:08,228 --> 01:01:11,028
(She caught two fish at a time) 

1561
01:01:11,694 --> 01:01:12,994
I got it! 

1562
01:01:12,994 --> 01:01:15,261
I got it. I got two of them. 

1563
01:01:15,261 --> 01:01:16,428
- Did you see that? / - Yes. 

1564
01:01:16,428 --> 01:01:17,594
- See? / - That was so cool. 

1565
01:01:17,594 --> 01:01:21,261
See? My bucket is full of fish. 

1566
01:01:21,261 --> 01:01:22,594
Do you see it? 

1567
01:01:23,961 --> 01:01:25,028
This isn't easy. 

1568
01:01:25,028 --> 01:01:26,928
(Yeonwoo tries hard to lure fish) 

1569
01:01:28,061 --> 01:01:29,361
(Yeonwoo's fishing rod shakes heavily) 

1570
01:01:29,361 --> 01:01:31,661
The important thing is that they don't have bait. 

1571
01:01:31,661 --> 01:01:33,428
- Right. Without bait. / - They're fishing without bait. 

1572
01:01:33,561 --> 01:01:34,694
Look at her face. 

1573
01:01:35,061 --> 01:01:37,428
- Because of the sea breeze... / - Yeonwoo got it. 

1574
01:01:37,428 --> 01:01:39,794
It's like half fish and half water. 

1575
01:01:39,794 --> 01:01:41,794
(She finally caught one) 

1576
01:01:41,794 --> 01:01:43,428
- How many? / - Two fish. 

1577
01:01:43,428 --> 01:01:45,194
(Yeonwoo caught two fish) 

1578
01:01:45,194 --> 01:01:46,494
The place offers the best fishing. 

1579
01:01:46,494 --> 01:01:47,861
And there are various kinds of fish. 

1580
01:01:47,861 --> 01:01:49,194
- Right. / - They are very big. 

1581
01:01:49,194 --> 01:01:51,594
- Without a bait. / - You caught 5 fish in 10 minutes? 

1582
01:01:51,594 --> 01:01:55,594
We went there in September. 

1583
01:01:55,594 --> 01:01:57,828
It's even better in July and August. 

1584
01:01:57,828 --> 01:01:58,861
I see. 

1585
01:01:59,661 --> 01:02:02,128
I got it again. I caught fish. 

1586
01:02:03,061 --> 01:02:04,461
One fish. 

1587
01:02:04,461 --> 01:02:07,928
See? My bucket is full of fish. 

1588
01:02:07,928 --> 01:02:10,961
If you cast it, you can catch one in 3 minutes. 

1589
01:02:11,561 --> 01:02:13,394
Yeonwoo, I caught one more. 

1590
01:02:13,394 --> 01:02:14,494
(Jooe 5, Yeonwoo 2) 

1591
01:02:14,494 --> 01:02:16,694
(Yeonwoo caught two more fish) 

1592
01:02:16,694 --> 01:02:17,861
It's big. 

1593
01:02:18,528 --> 01:02:20,828
I caught two again! 

1594
01:02:20,828 --> 01:02:23,128
(They catch fish every time they cast their rods) 

1595
01:02:23,128 --> 01:02:24,761
- I got it. / - Gosh, what's going on? 

1596
01:02:24,761 --> 01:02:25,761
Already? 

1597
01:02:25,761 --> 01:02:27,461
- It looks so fun. / - It's been less than 30 minutes. 

1598
01:02:27,461 --> 01:02:29,794
- How many fish? / - It's the best fishing we've seen. 

1599
01:02:29,794 --> 01:02:30,794
Really? 

1600
01:02:30,794 --> 01:02:32,694
Gyeonggyu would love this, Yeonwoo. 

1601
01:02:32,694 --> 01:02:34,228
(Gyeonggyu would love to go fishing with her) 

1602
01:02:34,228 --> 01:02:35,194
(They caught 13 fish in 30 minutes) 

1603
01:02:35,194 --> 01:02:36,594
We have bait now. 

1604
01:02:36,994 --> 01:02:39,461
It works even better with bait. 

1605
01:02:39,461 --> 01:02:41,928
(They try fishing with bait now) 

1606
01:02:44,561 --> 01:02:46,928
We released the small fish. 

1607
01:02:46,928 --> 01:02:49,294
- I guess there's a rule. / - The babies. 

1608
01:02:49,294 --> 01:02:51,061
(She gets a bite as soon as she casts the fishing rod) 

1609
01:02:52,328 --> 01:02:54,128
I hope it will be a big one. 

1610
01:02:55,994 --> 01:02:57,394
Gosh, what's that? 

1611
01:02:57,394 --> 01:02:59,328
- What? I guess it's big. / - Maybe it's four of them. 

1612
01:02:59,328 --> 01:03:00,894
She can't reel it in. 

1613
01:03:00,894 --> 01:03:02,094
It's so strong. 

1614
01:03:02,094 --> 01:03:05,594
(It's not easy to reel in) 

1615
01:03:06,761 --> 01:03:08,428
(Jooe's rod, Yeonwoo's rod) 

1616
01:03:08,428 --> 01:03:09,694
The fishing rod is bent. 

1617
01:03:09,694 --> 01:03:11,761
(It's not easy to reel up the fish) 

1618
01:03:11,761 --> 01:03:13,294
What? What did she catch? 

1619
01:03:13,628 --> 01:03:15,028
I got it. 

1620
01:03:15,028 --> 01:03:16,328
(The fish is finally coming up to the surface) 

1621
01:03:16,328 --> 01:03:17,961
Don't you need a scoop net? 

1622
01:03:17,961 --> 01:03:19,294
(The fish is finally coming up to the surface) 

1623
01:03:19,294 --> 01:03:20,361
My goodness. 

1624
01:03:21,894 --> 01:03:23,994
- What? / - That's amazing. 

1625
01:03:24,394 --> 01:03:26,594
- This is unbelievable. / - My gosh. 

1626
01:03:26,594 --> 01:03:28,394
Five fish? 

1627
01:03:28,961 --> 01:03:30,128
It looks gross. 

1628
01:03:30,128 --> 01:03:32,194
It's not gross. It's beautiful. 

1629
01:03:32,194 --> 01:03:34,061
Gosh, this is amazing. 

1630
01:03:34,061 --> 01:03:35,894
Are the fish stupid? 

1631
01:03:36,161 --> 01:03:37,461
It was amazing. 

1632
01:03:37,461 --> 01:03:39,494
We caught 20 fish in an instant. 

1633
01:03:42,061 --> 01:03:43,461
Please take a picture of us. 

1634
01:03:43,861 --> 01:03:44,928
I can't believe this. 

1635
01:03:45,328 --> 01:03:47,494
(Jooe is a little afraid of fish) 

1636
01:03:47,494 --> 01:03:49,294
- It looks so fun. / - Oh, my goodness. 

1637
01:03:49,294 --> 01:03:50,994
- She's afraid of fish. / - Gosh, wait. 

1638
01:03:50,994 --> 01:03:52,261
- She caught sea-perch again. / - Sea-perch. 

1639
01:03:52,261 --> 01:03:53,528
It's so big. 

1640
01:03:53,528 --> 01:03:55,294
Jooe's very lucky when she fishes. 

1641
01:03:55,294 --> 01:03:57,161
- Right. / - I think I'm lucky. 

1642
01:03:58,994 --> 01:04:04,328
(You can catch various kinds of fish at the right time) 

1643
01:04:04,328 --> 01:04:05,828
(Captain) 

1644
01:04:06,628 --> 01:04:08,294
- Fillet the fish. / - What are you talking about? 

1645
01:04:08,294 --> 01:04:09,328
I'm not done yet. 

1646
01:04:09,328 --> 01:04:11,361
- Yeonwoo, the bucket is full. / -  Give me 2 hours. 

1647
01:04:11,361 --> 01:04:12,761
It's not full yet. 

1648
01:04:12,761 --> 01:04:14,161
I have a lot of fish. 

1649
01:04:14,161 --> 01:04:15,928
Gosh, they caught 20 in total. 

1650
01:04:15,928 --> 01:04:17,761
- Fillet the fish now. I'm hungry. / - Are you serious? 

1651
01:04:17,761 --> 01:04:18,794
I'm hungry. 

1652
01:04:18,794 --> 01:04:19,794
(How can we eat this?) 

1653
01:04:20,294 --> 01:04:22,894
Director, can you please help us? 

1654
01:04:22,894 --> 01:04:25,294
(We want to eat raw fish) 

1655
01:04:25,294 --> 01:04:26,861
We will give you one fish. 

1656
01:04:26,861 --> 01:04:29,128
Right. We will give you one for free. 

1657
01:04:29,928 --> 01:04:31,994
(Okay, I'll fillet the fish for you) 

1658
01:04:33,161 --> 01:04:34,494
(The director fillets the fish) 

1659
01:04:34,494 --> 01:04:37,594
The captain is supposed to do this. 

1660
01:04:37,594 --> 01:04:39,894
In Russia, they don't eat raw fish. 

1661
01:04:39,894 --> 01:04:40,828
Oh, that's right. 

1662
01:04:40,828 --> 01:04:42,361
They don't know how to fillet the fish. 

1663
01:04:42,361 --> 01:04:44,228
The director seems good at this though. 

1664
01:04:44,228 --> 01:04:45,628
- It looks delicious. / - He looks skilled. 

1665
01:04:45,961 --> 01:04:48,394
- Cold sea fish taste good. / - The director... 

1666
01:04:48,394 --> 01:04:52,161
(Jooe finally tastes the raw fish) 

1667
01:04:52,161 --> 01:04:54,194
(It's so delicious) 

1668
01:04:54,694 --> 01:04:55,861
(Yeonwoo tastes it too) 

1669
01:04:55,861 --> 01:04:56,994
It's good. 

1670
01:04:58,361 --> 01:04:59,694
It's delicious. 

1671
01:04:59,694 --> 01:05:01,728
- It was really good. / - It was so delicious. 

1672
01:05:01,728 --> 01:05:03,028
I've never tried fresh-caught fish. 

1673
01:05:03,461 --> 01:05:06,228
Thanks to you, I finally get to eat fish in Sakhalin. 

1674
01:05:06,228 --> 01:05:09,394
It feels like this sea-perch is moving in my mouth. 

1675
01:05:09,394 --> 01:05:10,561
By the way, 

1676
01:05:10,561 --> 01:05:13,628
it's not easy to get sauce in Sakhalin. 

1677
01:05:13,628 --> 01:05:16,694
There are a lot of Korean products there. 

1678
01:05:16,694 --> 01:05:18,428
They sell hot pepper paste with vinegar there? 

1679
01:05:18,428 --> 01:05:19,928
Yes. In the supermarket. 

1680
01:05:19,928 --> 01:05:21,061
We went to a supermarket, 

1681
01:05:21,061 --> 01:05:21,894
and there was everything. 

1682
01:05:21,894 --> 01:05:23,061
They sell everything. 

1683
01:05:27,228 --> 01:05:31,028
(They're enjoying the raw fish) 

1684
01:05:33,428 --> 01:05:35,761
We ate it all. 

1685
01:05:35,761 --> 01:05:37,328
To be honest, 

1686
01:05:37,328 --> 01:05:38,428
I'm not full yet. 

1687
01:05:38,961 --> 01:05:40,228
Of course not. 

1688
01:05:40,228 --> 01:05:43,028
Most people won't get full on this. 

1689
01:05:43,494 --> 01:05:45,528
We can have crabs... 

1690
01:05:46,128 --> 01:05:48,361
At the captain's place. 

1691
01:05:48,761 --> 01:05:49,528
Really? 

1692
01:05:49,528 --> 01:05:52,028
We have to eat crabs in Sakhalin. 

1693
01:05:52,028 --> 01:05:53,894
Now that we tasted raw fish, 

1694
01:05:53,894 --> 01:05:55,561
we should eat crabs now. 

1695
01:05:55,561 --> 01:05:57,028
We will just taste some crabs? 

1696
01:05:57,028 --> 01:05:59,128
No, we will eat a lot. 

1697
01:05:59,928 --> 01:06:01,194
(Moa Moa Tour, Yeonwoo's Outskirts Tour) 

1698
01:06:01,194 --> 01:06:05,328
(Sakhalin king crab) 

1699
01:06:05,328 --> 01:06:06,628
- It's here. / - Crab. 

1700
01:06:07,494 --> 01:06:09,594
- Gosh, this is a problem. / - It looks weird. 

1701
01:06:09,594 --> 01:06:10,694
- What's that? / - This is too strong. 

1702
01:06:10,694 --> 01:06:11,761
Those are all horns. 

1703
01:06:11,761 --> 01:06:13,894
You should be careful when you eat it. 

1704
01:06:13,894 --> 01:06:15,394
- Look at that. / - You can't find... 

1705
01:06:15,394 --> 01:06:17,361
- That crab in Korea. / - I've never seen it before. 

1706
01:06:17,361 --> 01:06:18,994
How... How... 

1707
01:06:18,994 --> 01:06:20,228
You can't even freeze it? 

1708
01:06:20,228 --> 01:06:21,661
- No. / - Is it a natural monument? 

1709
01:06:21,661 --> 01:06:24,594
- You can eat it only in Sakhalin. / - Natural monument. 

1710
01:06:27,494 --> 01:06:30,394
- It's from the Sea of Okhotsk. / - Sea of Okhotsk. 

1711
01:06:30,394 --> 01:06:31,961
- You can find it in Korea... / - It's only $20? 

1712
01:06:31,961 --> 01:06:32,594
But there are not many. 

1713
01:06:32,594 --> 01:06:34,261
- How much is it? / - It's $20 per kilogram. 

1714
01:06:34,261 --> 01:06:36,628
(It's the best dish in Sakhalin) 

1715
01:06:36,628 --> 01:06:38,128
It's right next to the ocean. 

1716
01:06:38,128 --> 01:06:39,961
The captain's house is right there. 

1717
01:06:40,394 --> 01:06:43,661
He also provides lodging for tourists 

1718
01:06:43,661 --> 01:06:46,494
who come here for fishing. 

1719
01:06:46,494 --> 01:06:49,561
This is a special course I prepared for you. 

1720
01:06:49,561 --> 01:06:51,528
(They have the last meal at the captain's house) 

1721
01:06:51,661 --> 01:06:52,961
There's nothing though. 

1722
01:06:52,961 --> 01:06:54,761
- I want to eat. / - It'll be served soon. 

1723
01:06:54,761 --> 01:06:55,928
It'll be served live. 

1724
01:06:55,928 --> 01:06:57,194
Live? 

1725
01:06:57,194 --> 01:06:59,094
We will eat a live crab. 

1726
01:06:59,094 --> 01:07:01,261
- It's here. / - The captain's wife serves it? 

1727
01:07:01,261 --> 01:07:02,294
(What's that?) 

1728
01:07:02,294 --> 01:07:04,294
It'd look scary. 

1729
01:07:04,661 --> 01:07:07,494
- It fills the whole tray. / - It looks so scary though. 

1730
01:07:07,494 --> 01:07:08,994
You choose which one to eat? 

1731
01:07:10,661 --> 01:07:12,961
- You should choose. / - This type of crabs... 

1732
01:07:12,961 --> 01:07:14,594
Are very valuable here. 

1733
01:07:14,594 --> 01:07:16,061
- You have to try it. / - Right. 

1734
01:07:16,061 --> 01:07:17,861
This is what we usually eat. 

1735
01:07:17,861 --> 01:07:20,461
I want the red king crab over the other one. 

1736
01:07:20,461 --> 01:07:21,528
Sounds good. 

1737
01:07:25,228 --> 01:07:29,361
(The red king crab goes straight into boiling water) 

1738
01:07:29,361 --> 01:07:31,028
They cook it in boiling water instead of steaming it? 

1739
01:07:31,028 --> 01:07:32,128
It looks good. 

1740
01:07:32,994 --> 01:07:34,494
That's why it's so moist. 

1741
01:07:34,494 --> 01:07:35,528
- They didn't steam it. / - It looks delicious. 

1742
01:07:35,528 --> 01:07:36,561
They don't just steam it. 

1743
01:07:36,561 --> 01:07:38,194
- They steam it and boil it. / - Yes. 

1744
01:07:40,361 --> 01:07:41,461
(The red king crab boasts it's red color) 

1745
01:07:41,461 --> 01:07:43,661
That was really amazing. 

1746
01:07:43,661 --> 01:07:45,694
- Gosh, look at that. / - That looks good. 

1747
01:07:46,328 --> 01:07:47,428
It really looks big. 

1748
01:07:47,428 --> 01:07:52,094
(She takes a big bite of the claw first) 

1749
01:07:53,994 --> 01:07:55,494
(The size of the red king crab is surprising) 

1750
01:07:55,494 --> 01:07:56,861
- It is full of meat. / - That claw alone... 

1751
01:07:56,861 --> 01:07:58,294
- Would make you full. / - Yeah. 

1752
01:07:59,328 --> 01:08:01,161
It costs only $20 per kilogram. 

1753
01:08:01,161 --> 01:08:04,061
It is really full of meat. 

1754
01:08:04,061 --> 01:08:05,428
(Jooe also takes a bite of the red king crab) 

1755
01:08:06,661 --> 01:08:08,861
It's really meaty. 

1756
01:08:08,861 --> 01:08:11,361
It tastes a little different from average king crab. 

1757
01:08:11,361 --> 01:08:15,061
Average king crabs feel like crab meat. 

1758
01:08:15,061 --> 01:08:17,994
This is chewier. It's almost like squid. 

1759
01:08:17,994 --> 01:08:19,261
Nice and chewy. 

1760
01:08:19,261 --> 01:08:21,294
The texture is amazing. 

1761
01:08:22,161 --> 01:08:23,928
The reason why it's good is because... 

1762
01:08:24,528 --> 01:08:27,628
It's not only fresh but also well-seasoned. 

1763
01:08:27,628 --> 01:08:28,761
(It's more flavorful because of the natural saltiness) 

1764
01:08:28,761 --> 01:08:31,661
- They need wine. / - Champagne or white wine. 

1765
01:08:31,661 --> 01:08:33,761
- White wine. / - Beer. 

1766
01:08:33,761 --> 01:08:35,228
They don't sell alcohol. 

1767
01:08:35,228 --> 01:08:38,561
You can bring your own drinks. 

1768
01:08:38,561 --> 01:08:39,594
That's amazing! 

1769
01:08:40,094 --> 01:08:41,294
- That's even better! / - That's even better! 

1770
01:08:41,294 --> 01:08:43,361
- Even better. / - You don't have to pay for drinks. 

1771
01:08:43,361 --> 01:08:44,528
- That's right. / - Of course. 

1772
01:08:45,461 --> 01:08:46,861
I should go to Sakhalin. 

1773
01:08:46,861 --> 01:08:48,394
(The plain red king crab tastes amazing) 

1774
01:08:48,394 --> 01:08:50,894
- It's so good. / - This is it. 

1775
01:08:51,594 --> 01:08:54,094
Aren't crustaceans beautiful? 

1776
01:08:55,028 --> 01:09:00,394
There is soft flesh inside these hard shells. 

1777
01:09:00,394 --> 01:09:02,961
I was so surprised. I thought it was a facial spray. 

1778
01:09:03,494 --> 01:09:04,661
How is it different? 

1779
01:09:05,194 --> 01:09:06,528
Compared to ordinary blue crabs. 

1780
01:09:06,528 --> 01:09:09,361
- It's a little chewier. / - Chewier? 

1781
01:09:09,361 --> 01:09:11,461
- The texture is like squid. / - Really? 

1782
01:09:11,461 --> 01:09:13,994
- It's really chewy. / - The meat is kind of like... 

1783
01:09:14,761 --> 01:09:16,728
- Red king crabs are like this. / - It's very firm? 

1784
01:09:16,728 --> 01:09:18,061
It's very firm. 

1785
01:09:18,061 --> 01:09:20,128
You can feel the chewiness when you chew? 

1786
01:09:20,128 --> 01:09:24,228
(They eat it up in no time) 

1787
01:09:24,894 --> 01:09:27,861
(They feed each other) 

1788
01:09:31,661 --> 01:09:36,028
(This is the result of them eating and eating) 

1789
01:09:36,894 --> 01:09:38,961
I think we ate it clean. 

1790
01:09:38,961 --> 01:09:41,728
(There aren't any legs left) 

1791
01:09:42,494 --> 01:09:44,294
Can't you eat this in front of you? 

1792
01:09:44,294 --> 01:09:46,128
We will eat the body now. 

1793
01:09:46,694 --> 01:09:50,528
(Take the shell off) 

1794
01:09:50,528 --> 01:09:51,861
It's filled with a lot of things. 

1795
01:09:52,994 --> 01:09:54,828
This also has a lot of meat. 

1796
01:09:54,828 --> 01:09:56,061
(The meat from the body is revealed) 

1797
01:09:56,061 --> 01:09:57,461
You have to dip it with what's inside there. 

1798
01:09:57,461 --> 01:09:58,628
- That's right. / - Gosh. 

1799
01:09:59,428 --> 01:10:00,861
You have to dip it with... 

1800
01:10:00,861 --> 01:10:02,128
- What's inside there. / - That's right. 

1801
01:10:02,628 --> 01:10:04,994
You have to eat it mixed with white rice. 

1802
01:10:05,361 --> 01:10:06,794
It's chewy. 

1803
01:10:06,794 --> 01:10:09,761
(They both take a big bite) 

1804
01:10:09,761 --> 01:10:11,894
This part is really delicious. 

1805
01:10:11,894 --> 01:10:14,328
It's really delicious. It's really delicious. 

1806
01:10:16,661 --> 01:10:17,661
It's really chewy. 

1807
01:10:17,661 --> 01:10:19,861
- She's showing it for us. / - It was really moist. 

1808
01:10:19,861 --> 01:10:22,361
The legs taste better for crabs like this than the meat. 

1809
01:10:22,361 --> 01:10:25,561
The captain recommended the body for us. 

1810
01:10:25,561 --> 01:10:28,328
(Jooe takes it and bites it off) 

1811
01:10:29,128 --> 01:10:30,628
Everyone, you must hurry. 

1812
01:10:30,628 --> 01:10:32,394
In a month, that place will be packed with Koreans. 

1813
01:10:34,294 --> 01:10:37,494
(They focus on eating without talking) 

1814
01:10:37,494 --> 01:10:39,361
It's really good. That was amazing. 

1815
01:10:40,694 --> 01:10:42,528
(Only the shells are left!) 

1816
01:10:43,728 --> 01:10:45,961
2kg is too little. 

1817
01:10:45,961 --> 01:10:47,361
You should order one more. 

1818
01:10:48,028 --> 01:10:50,761
The flow shouldn't be stopped. Hurry! 

1819
01:10:50,761 --> 01:10:52,661
- 1 person should eat 1 crab. / - Yes. 

1820
01:10:53,294 --> 01:10:55,261
- We did a refill. / - That's right. 

1821
01:10:55,261 --> 01:10:57,028
Oh, my God. 

1822
01:10:57,028 --> 01:10:58,394
You should eat quickly. 

1823
01:10:59,428 --> 01:11:00,961
(They attack the legs as soon as it came out) 

1824
01:11:00,961 --> 01:11:02,728
I want to live in Russia. 

1825
01:11:03,394 --> 01:11:05,661
She's not even putting the scissors down to eat. 

1826
01:11:06,128 --> 01:11:07,161
She knows the taste. 

1827
01:11:07,161 --> 01:11:08,728
She forgot about the camera. 

1828
01:11:09,428 --> 01:11:11,661
We didn't respect the food by showing good manners. 

1829
01:11:11,661 --> 01:11:13,761
- Why? / - We didn't take photos. 

1830
01:11:13,761 --> 01:11:15,128
- Photo. / - They forgot to take a photo. 

1831
01:11:15,128 --> 01:11:17,561
We were distracted. 

1832
01:11:17,561 --> 01:11:20,728
(They already finished eating everything) 

1833
01:11:20,728 --> 01:11:22,728
(They've already cut the legs) 

1834
01:11:22,728 --> 01:11:24,628
Such bad manners. 

1835
01:11:24,628 --> 01:11:26,994
- Let's put them back. / - Okay. 

1836
01:11:27,628 --> 01:11:29,461
There are people like that. 

1837
01:11:29,761 --> 01:11:31,761
I can't understand people who pull the crab apart 

1838
01:11:31,761 --> 01:11:33,261
and make it whole again just for a photo. 

1839
01:11:33,261 --> 01:11:37,761
We wanted to go that far because it looked so good. 

1840
01:11:37,761 --> 01:11:39,361
- You're cruel. / - The legs are all apart. 

1841
01:11:39,361 --> 01:11:40,428
(You can see the cut leg here) 

1842
01:11:40,428 --> 01:11:42,361
That's enough. Let's eat. 

1843
01:11:42,794 --> 01:11:44,928
- Cheers! / - Cheers! 

1844
01:11:45,561 --> 01:11:47,828
(Can't get sick of the red king crab) 

1845
01:11:47,828 --> 01:11:49,194
It's good. 

1846
01:11:50,128 --> 01:11:52,961
- Gosh. / - That looks really delicious. 

1847
01:11:53,394 --> 01:11:55,628
They ate a lot. 

1848
01:11:56,728 --> 01:12:00,094
It's cheap. You should eat like that when you're there. 

1849
01:12:00,094 --> 01:12:01,828
- It's cheap. / - Yes. 

1850
01:12:01,828 --> 01:12:03,261
Today is really amazing. 

1851
01:12:03,261 --> 01:12:07,061
We fished and ate something that's only in Russia. 

1852
01:12:07,261 --> 01:12:09,528
It's so nice but I feel sad. 

1853
01:12:10,194 --> 01:12:11,261
I feel really sad. 

1854
01:12:11,261 --> 01:12:12,828
We ate a lot 

1855
01:12:12,828 --> 01:12:14,594
but there's so much we haven't tried. 

1856
01:12:14,894 --> 01:12:16,461
- Let's come again next time. / - Okay. 

1857
01:12:16,461 --> 01:12:18,594
Let's come to eat. 

1858
01:12:18,594 --> 01:12:19,761
- Let's come to eat. / - Let's come to eat. 

1859
01:12:19,761 --> 01:12:21,461
- Not for other things. / - Let's come to drink Vodka. 

1860
01:12:21,461 --> 01:12:22,894
I'm really happy. 

1861
01:12:24,994 --> 01:12:27,428
(The last night in Sakhalin came before they knew) 

1862
01:12:27,428 --> 01:12:28,528
Where is this place? 

1863
01:12:28,528 --> 01:12:31,661
- It's right there. / - In front of the captain's house. 

1864
01:12:31,661 --> 01:12:33,561
- The captain is working hard. / - It's our last night. 

1865
01:12:33,561 --> 01:12:34,894
- The last night came. / - Yes. 

1866
01:12:35,561 --> 01:12:37,928
To be honest, I always went... 

1867
01:12:38,228 --> 01:12:41,061
On trips with my family. 

1868
01:12:41,061 --> 01:12:44,461
It's my first time going on a trip with a friend. 

1869
01:12:45,094 --> 01:12:46,861
We had lots of fun today. 

1870
01:12:46,861 --> 01:12:48,228
We went on rides yesterday. 

1871
01:12:48,928 --> 01:12:49,994
It was really fun. 

1872
01:12:49,994 --> 01:12:51,561
We shouted together 

1873
01:12:51,561 --> 01:12:53,294
without worrying about anything else. 

1874
01:12:53,661 --> 01:12:54,794
I think I was the only excited one. 

1875
01:12:54,794 --> 01:12:57,228
- Yes. / - As you said... 

1876
01:12:57,228 --> 01:13:00,194
This was also my first time going on a trip like this. 

1877
01:13:00,494 --> 01:13:02,728
I was worried a lot, 

1878
01:13:02,728 --> 01:13:06,061
but there was no need to be worried. 

1879
01:13:06,061 --> 01:13:08,094
I had so much fun. 

1880
01:13:08,094 --> 01:13:09,828
- That's right. / - It's not easy to go on a trip... 

1881
01:13:09,828 --> 01:13:12,994
To Sakhalin but we came here. 

1882
01:13:12,994 --> 01:13:15,828
- That's right. / - It's so full of charm... 

1883
01:13:15,828 --> 01:13:17,928
And it's so beautiful. 

1884
01:13:17,928 --> 01:13:19,694
I think it will become a good memory. 

1885
01:13:20,628 --> 01:13:24,061
It was more meaningful and fun than I thought. 

1886
01:13:24,061 --> 01:13:25,061
I really liked it. 

1887
01:13:25,061 --> 01:13:27,494
Thank you for having fun with me. 

1888
01:13:27,494 --> 01:13:28,594
- Okay. / - Thank you. 

1889
01:13:28,594 --> 01:13:30,594
I went through some trouble to play with you. 

1890
01:13:31,094 --> 01:13:33,328
I played with you today. 

1891
01:13:33,861 --> 01:13:35,128
- You know that, right? / - We had fun together. 

1892
01:13:35,128 --> 01:13:37,761
That's right. We had fun together. 

1893
01:13:37,761 --> 01:13:38,894
Cheers. 

1894
01:13:41,594 --> 01:13:44,828
(The end of Moa Moa Tour's Sakhalin trip) 

1895
01:13:46,428 --> 01:13:47,461
That's enough. 

1896
01:13:47,828 --> 01:13:49,961
I think it's enough for us. 

1897
01:13:49,961 --> 01:13:51,928
I think we really reached the highest point. 

1898
01:13:51,928 --> 01:13:53,828
- That's enough. / - How did it feel to catch 5 fish? 

1899
01:13:53,828 --> 01:13:55,328
- That's right. / - It was your first time fishing. 

1900
01:13:55,328 --> 01:13:56,894
She was even afraid of fish. 

1901
01:13:56,894 --> 01:13:58,194
I had so much fun. 

1902
01:13:58,194 --> 01:14:01,528
It felt so nice to catch 5 fish at once. 

1903
01:14:01,528 --> 01:14:04,228
- That's why people fish. / - That's why people fish. 

1904
01:14:04,661 --> 01:14:05,961
She opened her eyes to fishing. 

1905
01:14:05,961 --> 01:14:08,594
It was so fun. More so because I caught more fish 

1906
01:14:08,594 --> 01:14:09,828
than Yeonwoo. 

1907
01:14:10,361 --> 01:14:12,094
You can't fish if you go there right now, right? 

1908
01:14:12,094 --> 01:14:13,428
It's October. It will become winter soon. 

1909
01:14:13,428 --> 01:14:15,761
- No, in the wintertime... / - Yes? 

1910
01:14:15,761 --> 01:14:18,228
- You can do ice fishing. / - You can do ice fishing. 

1911
01:14:18,228 --> 01:14:20,028
- Can you fish on top of ice? / - Yes. 

1912
01:14:20,028 --> 01:14:22,094
- Can you do ice fishing? / - Yes, you can do it. 

1913
01:14:22,094 --> 01:14:23,094
I need to go there. 

1914
01:14:23,094 --> 01:14:24,494
There are so many good things to eat. 

1915
01:14:24,494 --> 01:14:26,494
If you like to fish, 

1916
01:14:26,494 --> 01:14:29,061
July to September will be perfect for you. 

1917
01:14:29,394 --> 01:14:31,261
If you go on time, you will have a lot of fun. 

1918
01:14:31,261 --> 01:14:34,528
You ate 4kg of crab. Wasn't that too much... 

1919
01:14:34,994 --> 01:14:37,528
- For a girl group? / - We refrained ourselves a little. 

1920
01:14:37,528 --> 01:14:38,228
- Did you refrain yourselves? / - Really? 

1921
01:14:38,228 --> 01:14:39,028
We even had dessert. 

1922
01:14:39,028 --> 01:14:40,794
- Could you eat more? / - Of course. 

1923
01:14:40,794 --> 01:14:43,428
Can you eat red king crabs anytime then? 

1924
01:14:43,428 --> 01:14:45,394
Or do they have a specific season? 

1925
01:14:45,394 --> 01:14:47,794
- They have a season. / - You must eat it. 

1926
01:14:47,794 --> 01:14:49,928
- It's not frequent. / - Yes. 

1927
01:14:49,928 --> 01:14:52,161
It depends on when they're caught. 

1928
01:14:53,028 --> 01:14:55,461
You can only have red king crab there. 

1929
01:14:55,461 --> 01:14:56,794
- Red king crabs. / - Red king crabs. 

1930
01:14:56,794 --> 01:14:58,294
Both of you are like the audience. 

1931
01:14:59,628 --> 01:15:01,061
We need to make plans. 

1932
01:15:01,061 --> 01:15:03,694
- We're holding hands. / - We were planning. 

1933
01:15:03,694 --> 01:15:05,728
- We should go there. / - Everyone, make plans to go. 

1934
01:15:05,728 --> 01:15:07,294
Let's check out how much they spent. 

1935
01:15:07,294 --> 01:15:09,328
- Our Moa Moa Tour... / - Should be a lot. 

1936
01:15:09,328 --> 01:15:12,161
Spent 3 days and 2 nights in Russia. 

1937
01:15:12,161 --> 01:15:13,861
- The amount we spent in Sakhalin is... / - It is? 

1938
01:15:13,861 --> 01:15:15,994

- We were much cheaper. / - Thing is... 

1942
01:15:24,928 --> 01:15:26,061
It wasn't cheap. 

1943
01:15:26,061 --> 01:15:28,161
The boat ride was $100 per person. 

1944
01:15:28,161 --> 01:15:29,228

1945
01:15:29,228 --> 01:15:32,128

1946
01:15:32,128 --> 01:15:33,961

1947
01:15:33,961 --> 01:15:35,228

1948
01:15:35,228 --> 01:15:37,261
- Okay, let's vote. / - Let's vote. 

1949
01:15:37,261 --> 01:15:39,594
Will you take Moa Moa Tour 

1950
01:15:39,594 --> 01:15:41,328
and travel to Sakhalin? Yes or no? 

1951
01:15:41,328 --> 01:15:43,561
- Please vote! / - Please vote! 

1952
01:15:44,594 --> 01:15:46,928
(They designed a trip to hidden location) 

1953
01:15:46,928 --> 01:15:50,694
(What will the judges choose?) 

1954
01:15:51,494 --> 01:15:55,428
Okay, will it be SuDa Signal's Bandung trip? 

1955
01:15:55,894 --> 01:15:58,528
Or will it be Moa Moa Tour's Sakhalin trip? 

1956
01:15:58,528 --> 01:16:00,928
What did the judges choose? 

1957
01:16:01,528 --> 01:16:05,161
- Here we go. / - Moa Moa Tour to Sakhalin. 

1958
01:16:05,561 --> 01:16:08,061
- SuDa Signal to Bandung. / - Bandung. 

1959
01:16:08,061 --> 01:16:10,094
Bandung, Sakhalin. Sakhalin, Bandung. 

1960
01:16:11,161 --> 01:16:12,328
The result? 

1961
01:16:13,428 --> 01:16:13,861
The result is... 

1962
01:16:17,194 --> 01:16:18,761
- Zero. Six. / - Oh, no. 

1963
01:16:18,761 --> 01:16:19,561
- Six! / - I'm nervous! 

1964
01:16:19,561 --> 01:16:21,928
- No, no. Moa Moa! / - Why am I scared? 

1965
01:16:21,928 --> 01:16:24,161
Come on nine! Show me a nine! 

1966
01:16:24,861 --> 01:16:25,961
Show me a nine! 

1967
01:16:26,294 --> 01:16:27,361
Show me a nine! 

1968
01:16:28,294 --> 01:16:32,194
(Bandung wins) 

1969
01:16:32,961 --> 01:16:34,628
(Sakhalin 76 vs. Bandung 90) 

1970
01:16:34,628 --> 01:16:36,528
What's going on? 

1971
01:16:37,161 --> 01:16:40,061
Our trip was really cost-effective. 

1972
01:16:40,061 --> 01:16:41,661
- That's right. / - It was about $200. 

1973
01:16:41,661 --> 01:16:44,028
- That's right. / - They were close to $400. 

1974
01:16:44,394 --> 01:16:46,361
They spent more money with the boat... 

1975
01:16:46,361 --> 01:16:47,928
- To show us more things. / - That's right. 

1976
01:16:47,928 --> 01:16:49,561
They can't beat us because of the cost. 

1977
01:16:49,561 --> 01:16:50,594
Alright, everyone. 

1978
01:16:50,594 --> 01:16:53,161
Hwan was here as the special host today. 

1979
01:16:53,161 --> 01:16:54,294
You almost fainted because of Sakhalin today. 

1980
01:16:54,294 --> 01:16:59,261
- I lost again today. / - Will you come again next week? 

1981
01:16:59,794 --> 01:17:01,594
Can't I just come next week? 

1982
01:17:01,594 --> 01:17:02,594
Since I lost? 

1983
01:17:02,594 --> 01:17:05,128
- Above all, it was so meaningful... / - Yes. 

1984
01:17:05,128 --> 01:17:08,328
- For the Sakhalin team. / - It was so nice.

01:17:13,794 --> 01:17:16,094
- Coming up next week. / - Yes. It's a special. 

1988
01:17:16,094 --> 01:17:19,028
Sikyung, I heard you two went on the trip! 

1989
01:17:19,028 --> 01:17:20,461
(Host special, Hwijae vs. Sikyung) 

1990
01:17:20,461 --> 01:17:22,061
It's a host special. 

1991
01:17:24,228 --> 01:17:27,128
It will be a gourmet trip next week. 

1992
01:17:27,761 --> 01:17:30,128
- They sent us to gain weight. / - Must tune in. 

1993
01:17:30,128 --> 01:17:32,961
Guess where they sent us? 

1994
01:17:32,961 --> 01:17:34,128
(What country did they design for a gourmet trip?) 

1995
01:17:34,128 --> 01:17:36,694
Sung Sikyung went to Italy. 

1996
01:17:37,761 --> 01:17:38,928
Lee Hwijae went to... 

1997
01:17:39,294 --> 01:17:40,994
Spain! 

1998
01:17:43,294 --> 01:17:44,561
It really suits both of them. 

1999
01:17:44,561 --> 01:17:46,928
They weren't the only ones who went on a trip. 

2000
01:17:46,928 --> 01:17:48,594
We weren't the only ones. 

2001
01:17:48,594 --> 01:17:52,328
We each went with the best chefs in Korea. 

2002
01:17:52,328 --> 01:17:54,428
- I'm really looking forward to it. / - It's a real battle. 

2003
01:17:54,428 --> 01:17:57,061
- To Spain? / - Please look forward to next week. 

2004
01:17:57,061 --> 01:17:58,861
The world is your school. Life is a journey. 

2005
01:17:58,861 --> 01:18:01,528
Battle Trip! 

2006
01:18:04,461 --> 01:18:05,794
(Next episode) 

2007
01:18:06,094 --> 01:18:10,194
I'm here in Catalonia Square! 

2008
01:18:10,194 --> 01:18:12,061
We have to watch Flamenco. 

2009
01:18:12,561 --> 01:18:13,694
It has history. 

2010
01:18:14,061 --> 01:18:16,594
It's called the kitchen of Europe. 

2011
01:18:16,594 --> 01:18:18,661
It's the largest food market. 

2012
01:18:18,661 --> 01:18:21,828
They have fire and tapas... 

2013
01:18:23,161 --> 01:18:24,128
This is incredible. 

2014
01:18:24,428 --> 01:18:26,394
It's weird doing this with a guy with a mustache. 

2015
01:18:26,394 --> 01:18:27,228
Why? 

2016
01:18:27,228 --> 01:18:28,128
This is amazing. 

2017
01:18:28,128 --> 01:18:29,728
How are we in an alley right now? 

2018
01:18:31,228 --> 01:18:34,461
If you don't stay focused here, you'd eat 900 calories. 

2019
01:18:34,794 --> 01:18:37,694
This is the Salute. 

2020
01:18:37,694 --> 01:18:39,561
- It's nice. / - It's really so cool. 

2021
01:18:39,561 --> 01:18:41,709
(Battle Trip)
