2
00:00:02,607 --> 00:00:05,007
- It's amazing here. / - It's amazing, right?

3
00:00:05,007 --> 00:00:07,374
Look over there!

4
00:00:09,674 --> 00:00:13,407
We should've come sooner. Just follow me.

5
00:00:13,774 --> 00:00:16,607
Wow, check this out.

6
00:00:16,607 --> 00:00:18,774
This was the inspiration for "Avatar."

7
00:00:18,774 --> 00:00:20,240
It's so cool.

8
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:22,074
It's perfect.

9
00:00:22,074 --> 00:00:24,707
Wow. Let's go!

10
00:00:24,707 --> 00:00:27,740
(Unique observatory where you can see the whole city)

11
00:00:29,607 --> 00:00:32,774
(Which team will win?)

12
00:00:34,007 --> 00:00:36,774
(Numerous great tips on trips)

13
00:00:37,507 --> 00:00:38,707
(Oh Nami, Lee Sookyung)

14
00:00:39,574 --> 00:00:40,740
(So Yujin, Kang Raeyeon)

15
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:41,807
Travel is war.

16
00:00:41,807 --> 00:00:44,074
Battle Trip.

17
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:45,607
Just like last week,

18
00:00:45,607 --> 00:00:48,807
we have the trip planners who planned

19
00:00:48,807 --> 00:00:50,540
the last-minute summer vacation trips.

20
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:52,074
- Welcome. / - Welcome back.

21
00:00:52,074 --> 00:00:53,740
- It's good to see you again. / - Nice to meet you.

22
00:00:53,874 --> 00:00:55,040
Last week...

23
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:57,340
- The whale shark was amazing. / - You're right.

24
00:00:57,340 --> 00:00:58,540
It was impressive.

25
00:00:58,540 --> 00:01:00,240
A lot of people asked me...

26
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:01,974
- How to get there. / - I see.

27
00:01:01,974 --> 00:01:03,607
I think they'll make that into a Nami Tour package.

28
00:01:03,607 --> 00:01:04,640
- I know. / - Starting with the whale sharks.

29
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:07,040
I'm going to Cebu again on my vacation.

30
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,307
- Again? / - Yes.

31
00:01:08,607 --> 00:01:09,840
Actually,

32
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,607
I want to thank Nami.

33
00:01:11,607 --> 00:01:13,607
Sookyung likes to stay at home all the time...

34
00:01:13,607 --> 00:01:15,140
- But you showed her a new world. / - Right.

35
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:16,340
- It's great. / - I know.

36
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:18,940
Sookyung, do you want to go on trips now?

37
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:20,674
- Not at your home. / - Not my home?

38
00:01:20,674 --> 00:01:22,174
A trip to your house doesn't count.

39
00:01:23,107 --> 00:01:24,974
If you like to drink,

40
00:01:24,974 --> 00:01:27,440
there are a lot of festivals.

41
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:29,840
A beer festival is held in Germany in September.

42
00:01:30,007 --> 00:01:31,840
- It's Oktoberfest. / - Right.

43
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,207
- It sounds very fun. / - German beer.

44
00:01:33,207 --> 00:01:34,774
- I want to go there. / - Sookyung.

45
00:01:34,774 --> 00:01:37,240
How many beers can you usually hold?

46
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:38,740
I can't hold a lot of beer though.

47
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:39,807
Do you like to drink strong liquor then?

48
00:01:39,807 --> 00:01:41,707
- Yes. / - This is the place.

49
00:01:42,007 --> 00:01:43,774
- You should go to China. / - Right.

50
00:01:43,774 --> 00:01:44,907
- Right? / - Definitely.

51
00:01:44,907 --> 00:01:47,474
- We'll see. / - Is there...

52
00:01:47,474 --> 00:01:50,307
A kaoliang festival in China?

53
00:01:50,407 --> 00:01:52,740
- A kaoliang festival? / - Sookyung.

54
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:54,107
If they have a kaoliang festival,

55
00:01:54,107 --> 00:01:55,674
people will black out there.

56
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:59,174
We have our 100 impartial judges

57
00:01:59,174 --> 00:02:00,907
who will vote on today's trips.

58
00:02:00,907 --> 00:02:02,807
- Welcome. / - Welcome.

59
00:02:04,974 --> 00:02:06,874
If you can go on a long vacation in September,

60
00:02:06,874 --> 00:02:08,107
where do you want to go?

61
00:02:08,107 --> 00:02:10,374
Raeyeon, you are a travel expert.

62
00:02:10,374 --> 00:02:11,807
- She's an expert now. / - Yes.

63
00:02:11,807 --> 00:02:14,340
I'm not an expert but I like to travel.

64
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:16,307
And I like to go on a long trip.

65
00:02:16,307 --> 00:02:19,807
Actually, this was my first time to go on a short trip.

66
00:02:19,807 --> 00:02:21,874
I once went on a 13-month-long trip.

67
00:02:21,874 --> 00:02:23,774
- 3 months? / - It's 13 months.

68
00:02:23,774 --> 00:02:26,407
- 13 months? / - It's more like a migration.

69
00:02:26,407 --> 00:02:27,507
Where did you go?

70
00:02:27,507 --> 00:02:29,474
- Europe? / - I traveled around North America.

71
00:02:29,474 --> 00:02:31,307
- That's so cool. / - It's like you immigrated there.

72
00:02:31,307 --> 00:02:33,274
- When I went to North America... / - She's a master.

73
00:02:33,274 --> 00:02:34,707
I kept moving around for 13 months.

74
00:02:34,707 --> 00:02:35,974
Do you come to Korea sometimes?

75
00:02:35,974 --> 00:02:37,740
- No, it's not like that. / - 13 months?

76
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:40,907
How long do you usually go on a summer vacation?

77
00:02:40,907 --> 00:02:43,107
About 30 to 40 days.

78
00:02:43,907 --> 00:02:45,540
I usually take short trips in the summer.

79
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:48,007
- But I don't like winter. / - Since she's a freelancer.

80
00:02:48,007 --> 00:02:49,674
Right, I can do that because I'm a freelancer.

81
00:02:49,674 --> 00:02:53,107
Then, can you recommend a good vacation spot?

82
00:02:53,107 --> 00:02:55,207
When people ask me

83
00:02:55,207 --> 00:02:56,974
what was the best travel destination,

84
00:02:56,974 --> 00:03:00,207
I always say the Rocky Mountains in Canada.

85
00:03:00,207 --> 00:03:01,340
It's amazing.

86
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:03,007
I think the Rocky Mountains is the best place

87
00:03:03,007 --> 00:03:05,374
and Jiuzhaigou and Huanglong in Sichuan

88
00:03:05,374 --> 00:03:06,540
are like mini versions of that.

89
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:09,407
- The colorful place? / - That's right.

90
00:03:09,407 --> 00:03:11,207
That place is very famous on the internet.

91
00:03:11,207 --> 00:03:12,607
It's so beautiful.

92
00:03:12,607 --> 00:03:13,974
- It really is. / - Jiuzhaigou?

93
00:03:13,974 --> 00:03:15,840
Anyway, most importantly,

94
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,407
like we had Kim Minkyo in Thailand

95
00:03:17,407 --> 00:03:19,874
and Sandara Park in the Philippines,

96
00:03:19,874 --> 00:03:22,340
we have Kang Raeyeon in China.

97
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:23,740
I think it will be very special today.

98
00:03:24,274 --> 00:03:25,940
I have a question.

99
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:27,807
- She said Chengdu. / - Yes.

100
00:03:27,807 --> 00:03:29,740
We've been to Chengdo though.

101
00:03:29,907 --> 00:03:31,974
Is there a difference between

102
00:03:31,974 --> 00:03:32,640
Chengdu and Chengdo?

103
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:33,874
- Please explain it to us. / - Or is it the same place?

104
00:03:33,874 --> 00:03:37,207
Back in the day, Beijing used to be called Peking.

105
00:03:37,207 --> 00:03:39,540
But now, we only use Beijing.

106
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:42,640
Just like that, Chengdo is actually Qingdao now.

107
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:45,074
Qingdao is Chengdo.

108
00:03:45,074 --> 00:03:47,207
- And Chengdu. / - Chengdu.

109
00:03:47,207 --> 00:03:48,807
It's pronounced Seongdo in Korean.

110
00:03:48,807 --> 00:03:51,874
- Seongdo. / - But in Chinese...

111
00:03:51,874 --> 00:03:53,540
It's Chengdu. It becomes Chengdu.

112
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:55,507
- She was so cool. So cool. / - My gosh.

113
00:03:55,507 --> 00:03:57,140
- I'm immersed already . / - I see.

114
00:03:57,140 --> 00:03:59,040
Then Chengdu is the Chinese pronunciation.

115
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,340
That's right. Chengdu.

116
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:03,607
- Learning can be fun. / - Exactly.

117
00:04:03,607 --> 00:04:07,307
Four areas in China are knows for delicious food.

118
00:04:07,307 --> 00:04:10,140
They are Beijing, Shanghai, Guangdong...

119
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:11,874
- And Sichuan where we'll head to. / - That's right.

120
00:04:11,874 --> 00:04:14,140
- The Sichuan cuisine is one. / - Right.

121
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:16,007
For the Beijing cuisine,

122
00:04:16,007 --> 00:04:17,307
although it's not exactly the same,

123
00:04:17,307 --> 00:04:18,574
it's similar to Chinese food in Korea.

124
00:04:18,574 --> 00:04:20,474
The Shanghai cuisine has more seafood

125
00:04:20,474 --> 00:04:22,107
as it's closer to the ocean.

126
00:04:22,107 --> 00:04:25,707
Since Sichuan is hot and humid,

127
00:04:25,707 --> 00:04:27,440
the Sichuan cuisine tends

128
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,474
to be spicy in order to help them stay healthy.

129
00:04:29,474 --> 00:04:31,474
Even the instant black bean noodles we eat...

130
00:04:31,474 --> 00:04:34,174
- Sichuan-style noodles are spicy. / - They're spicy.

131
00:04:34,174 --> 00:04:36,207
But it's a tasty kind of spiciness.

132
00:04:36,207 --> 00:04:39,474
You can look forward to that delicious spicy taste.

133
00:04:39,474 --> 00:04:41,940
Do you ask your husband for his opinions about this?

134
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:43,374
He likes it the most when I ask him...

135
00:04:43,374 --> 00:04:44,840
- About food. / - He does?

136
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:48,207
- He gets excited to talk about it. / - He does.

137
00:04:48,207 --> 00:04:50,807
He would recommend me restaurants to visit.

138
00:04:50,807 --> 00:04:52,674
He'd tell me the restaurants I must visit.

139
00:04:52,674 --> 00:04:55,574
He gives me tips on which dishes to order there.

140
00:04:55,574 --> 00:04:58,207
- I'm so jealous. / - He has a lot of data stored.

141
00:04:58,207 --> 00:04:59,807
- His data is outstanding. / - It's vast.

142
00:04:59,807 --> 00:05:02,174
He tells you what to eat and where.

143
00:05:02,174 --> 00:05:05,874
Let's check Chengdu in Sichuan on the map.

144
00:05:05,874 --> 00:05:09,240
- It's big. It's huge. / - From Incheon to Chengdu...

145
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:12,207
The average flight time is about 4 hours.

146
00:05:12,207 --> 00:05:13,807
- That's about the same with Cebu. / - Yes, it is.

147
00:05:13,807 --> 00:05:15,374
- You made it sound like it was far. / - Right.

148
00:05:15,374 --> 00:05:17,340
It took us 3 hours and 30 minutes.

149
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:19,074
In "Records of the Three Kingdoms,"

150
00:05:19,074 --> 00:05:20,007
is it Shu Han?

151
00:05:20,007 --> 00:05:23,407
- That's right. / - The state Liu Bei founded.

152
00:05:23,407 --> 00:05:25,707
- That's right. / - Korean travelers...

153
00:05:25,707 --> 00:05:27,474
Don't have much information on the city

154
00:05:27,474 --> 00:05:28,740
as a travel destination.

155
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:30,140
But amongst Chinese travelers,

156
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:31,840
Beijing was ranked 1st as the destination

157
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:32,874
they'd like to go during holidays.

158
00:05:32,874 --> 00:05:34,140
And the 2nd place was...

159
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:36,107
- It was Sichuan. / - Right.

160
00:05:36,107 --> 00:05:38,307
I heard that the difference in the votes was quite big.

161
00:05:38,307 --> 00:05:39,807
- No, that's not true. / - Not at all.

162
00:05:39,807 --> 00:05:42,540
The locals love to visit Chengdu.

163
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:45,274
- You made her feel competitive. / - That's why...

164
00:05:45,274 --> 00:05:48,107
- Over 200 million people visit. / - Each year.

165
00:05:48,107 --> 00:05:50,474
- 200 million people? / - How many are Chinese?

166
00:05:50,474 --> 00:05:52,374
- About 190 million people. / - It's about that many.

167
00:05:52,374 --> 00:05:54,174
- A lot of Chinese people go there. / - The locals?

168
00:05:54,174 --> 00:05:56,507
- There weren't many foreigners. / - Exactly.

169
00:05:56,507 --> 00:05:58,007
- Everyone was Chinese. / - That's true.

170
00:05:58,007 --> 00:06:00,240
- It's loved by Chinese travelers. / - Within China.

171
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,874
- That's right. / - That's a great city.

172
00:06:01,874 --> 00:06:03,607
UNESCO chose Chengdu

173
00:06:03,607 --> 00:06:06,440
as the first culinary city in Asia in 2010.

174
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:08,307
That proves that it's a city where

175
00:06:08,307 --> 00:06:12,140
there's a lot to see and eat.

176
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:14,607
But you would need a visa to go there, right?

177
00:06:14,607 --> 00:06:15,874
When you go to China,

178
00:06:15,874 --> 00:06:17,574
you'd need to apply for your visa.

179
00:06:17,574 --> 00:06:19,207
- I'll tell you a great tip. / - Okay.

180
00:06:19,207 --> 00:06:22,040
For example, say that you travel far, like to Paris.

181
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:24,474
If you're making a transfer in Chengdu...

182
00:06:24,474 --> 00:06:26,107
- You don't need the visa. / - When you transfer.

183
00:06:26,107 --> 00:06:28,307
- When you make a transfer. / - For how many hours?

184
00:06:28,307 --> 00:06:30,974
- 5 days. 72 hours in total. / - That's amazing.

185
00:06:30,974 --> 00:06:33,740
So you only need to pay for one flight ticket...

186
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:36,474
- And you can visit two countries. / - That's right.

187
00:06:36,474 --> 00:06:37,874
When you're going somewhere far,

188
00:06:37,874 --> 00:06:39,707
don't set your flight dates

189
00:06:39,707 --> 00:06:42,040
so you can visit the places we'll show you.

190
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,940
Anyway, I get the feeling this will be fun

191
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:46,640
because their trip will be totally different from Cebu.

192
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:49,040
- That's right. / - I think it'll be hard for you to choose.

193
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:52,074
Give us a highlight. We showed the whale sharks.

194
00:06:52,307 --> 00:06:55,107
- Pandas represent China. / - Pandas.

195
00:06:55,107 --> 00:06:57,107
Sichuan is the birthplace of those pandas,

196
00:06:57,107 --> 00:07:00,174
so you can look at those pandas,

197
00:07:00,174 --> 00:07:02,807
check out great food and night markets...

198
00:07:02,807 --> 00:07:04,507
Night markets there are amazing.

199
00:07:04,507 --> 00:07:05,974
If I were to make a comparison,

200
00:07:05,974 --> 00:07:08,440
that place is similar to Samcheong-dong in Korea.

201
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:09,140
It's outstanding.

202
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:11,607
You'd find something new every day.

203
00:07:11,607 --> 00:07:13,240
What's the name of your team? For the tour?

204
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:16,240
1, 2, 3. Zhendehao Tour!

205
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,207
Let's check it out. That was a bit weird.

206
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:22,174
Am I allowed to be on a popular TV show like this?

207
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:26,140
I've never been on a trip for a TV program.

208
00:07:28,507 --> 00:07:30,140
But you travel a lot.

209
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:31,940
Whenever you go on trips,

210
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:33,207
I always see that you can't be reached for

211
00:07:33,207 --> 00:07:35,740
specific dates on your profile.

212
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:38,040
Whenever people text me, they always ask this first.

213
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,240
"Where are you?"

214
00:07:39,574 --> 00:07:42,007
- "Are you in Korea?" / - "Are you in Korea?"

215
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:45,574
- She's really free-spirited. / - I'm so jealous.

216
00:07:45,574 --> 00:07:47,007
You're living a happy life.

217
00:07:47,007 --> 00:07:48,674
I'm delegating everything to you.

218
00:07:48,674 --> 00:07:50,740
My gosh, that's a lot of pressure.

219
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:53,607
The theme is the last-minute summer vacation.

220
00:07:53,607 --> 00:07:56,140
- A trip over the weekend. / - Last-minute vacation?

221
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:57,540
For people with limited vacation days.

222
00:07:57,540 --> 00:07:58,907
They use the weekends...

223
00:07:58,907 --> 00:08:01,907
- To go somewhere close. / - Somewhere accessible?

224
00:08:01,907 --> 00:08:04,174
- Places with direct flights. / - That would be better.

225
00:08:04,174 --> 00:08:06,774
We'd go there on a night flight, have fun for 2 days...

226
00:08:06,774 --> 00:08:08,674
- And come back at night. / - Friday to Sunday.

227
00:08:08,674 --> 00:08:11,274
Destinations we can go over the weekends.

228
00:08:11,274 --> 00:08:12,740
Then should we use my expertise?

229
00:08:13,974 --> 00:08:15,307
(The master of trips to China)

230
00:08:15,307 --> 00:08:16,407
Can I do that?

231
00:08:16,407 --> 00:08:18,740
What she said reassured me. That's so reassuring.

232
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:20,774
You're the best at that.

233
00:08:20,774 --> 00:08:22,407
- The outfit looks great on her. / - It does.

234
00:08:22,407 --> 00:08:25,307
- Where have you been to so far? / - In 2004 and 2008.

235
00:08:25,307 --> 00:08:28,240
I went around China for 70 days in total.

236
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,807
Despite that, I only saw two-thirds of China.

237
00:08:31,007 --> 00:08:33,540
- That's how massive China is. / - You traveled a lot.

238
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:37,340
I wanted to think of a new destination.

239
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:38,774
I thought about Lijiang in Yunnan Province,

240
00:08:38,774 --> 00:08:40,440
- I've never been there. / - But there's no direct flight.

241
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:43,174
- Really? / - It doesn't suit the theme.

242
00:08:43,174 --> 00:08:45,707
- I checked the places with direct flights. / - Right.

243
00:08:45,707 --> 00:08:48,407
- Have you been to Sichuan? / - No, I've never been.

244
00:08:48,407 --> 00:08:49,974
Actually, I've been to Sichuan

245
00:08:49,974 --> 00:08:53,440
but as soon as I landed in Chengdu,

246
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,407
I just spent a night there

247
00:08:54,407 --> 00:08:55,740
and couldn't look around the city at all.

248
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:57,774
I only went to Jiuzhaigou and Huanglong.

249
00:08:57,774 --> 00:08:59,340
(It's known as the greatest paradise on Earth)

250
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:01,607
- That's the place. / - Isn't it incredible?

251
00:09:01,607 --> 00:09:05,007
I checked out the city in Chengdu a bit.

252
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:07,474
- There's a lot to see. / - The city?

253
00:09:07,474 --> 00:09:09,407
I know nothing about that.

254
00:09:09,407 --> 00:09:11,540
- Really? You'll just follow me? / - Sichuan...

255
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:13,674
- Yes, I'm going to do that. / - You only know how to eat.

256
00:09:13,674 --> 00:09:16,474
Yes, I can enjoy the food to the fullest.

257
00:09:16,474 --> 00:09:18,874
In other words, she's like Sookyung.

258
00:09:18,874 --> 00:09:20,007
(Criticizing 2 people with 1 comment)

259
00:09:20,007 --> 00:09:22,740
Their trip is different from Nami's. They're very close.

260
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:25,040
- They communicate very well. / - Exactly.

261
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:27,374
- You guys talked really formally. / - Yes, they did.

262
00:09:27,374 --> 00:09:28,674
You can't get enough, right?

263
00:09:28,674 --> 00:09:30,540
- The spicy Sichuan cuisine? / - You can't get enough.

264
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:33,174
- Yes. / - Right?

265
00:09:33,174 --> 00:09:36,274
- This is awesome. I'm in. It's Sichuan. / - Got it.

266
00:09:36,774 --> 00:09:39,707
(Sichuan)

267
00:09:40,407 --> 00:09:43,540
(Chengdu in Sichuan)

268
00:09:44,607 --> 00:09:48,340
(Chengdu is the center of Sichuan)

269
00:09:48,574 --> 00:09:49,940
Pandas are the most famous Chinese animals.

270
00:09:50,807 --> 00:09:54,107
(The one and only habitat for pandas in China)

271
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:57,674
- They were so cute. / - It was amazing.

272
00:09:57,674 --> 00:10:00,274
- Look at them. / - I want that.

273
00:10:00,274 --> 00:10:02,007
- Spicy food. / - That looks really spicy.

274
00:10:02,007 --> 00:10:03,740
- What's that? / - That looks so delicious.

275
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:06,840
(Chengdu in Sichuan will introduce the spiciest food)

276
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:12,840
Let me research about the food since Chef Baek...

277
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:14,774
- Is my husband after all. / - That's true.

278
00:10:14,774 --> 00:10:17,207
I'll look into what we can eat there.

279
00:10:17,207 --> 00:10:18,540
- Let's get tips from him. / - Right.

280
00:10:19,207 --> 00:10:21,974
Besides, he went to Chengdu for a show not long ago.

281
00:10:21,974 --> 00:10:23,540
He went there to check out restaurants.

282
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:26,140
- He said the food was great. / - What did he say?

283
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:28,840
- A lot of the places didn't get to air. / - She must feel...

284
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:30,640
- So reassured. / - You know how he is, right?

285
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,707
Whenever I start something, he'd help me at home.

286
00:10:32,707 --> 00:10:36,074
"You must know how it tastes to not look ignorant."

287
00:10:36,074 --> 00:10:37,874
- He doesn't want you to look silly. / - Right.

288
00:10:37,874 --> 00:10:39,207
- He'll educate me. / - Right.

289
00:10:39,207 --> 00:10:41,474
- So for the food during our trip... / - This is great.

290
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:44,574
I'll ask him about some good restaurants.

291
00:10:44,574 --> 00:10:47,340
I'll be the local coordinator and guide you.

292
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:48,974
- That's great. / - It will be perfect.

293
00:10:48,974 --> 00:10:50,274
We must pick the name of our team.

294
00:10:50,274 --> 00:10:52,874
Let's use Chinese for that.

295
00:10:52,874 --> 00:10:55,807
You know the term you always say to me?

296
00:10:55,807 --> 00:10:57,674
In China, you always say, "Zhende."

297
00:10:57,674 --> 00:10:58,974
You always say that.

298
00:10:58,974 --> 00:11:00,974
- Good, "hao." / - Hao.

299
00:11:01,307 --> 00:11:02,307
- Then... / - Hao, hao.

300
00:11:02,307 --> 00:11:04,474
This is how you say, "really good." Zhendehao!

301
00:11:04,474 --> 00:11:06,840
Wait, that means "really good" in Chinese?

302
00:11:07,207 --> 00:11:08,307
- It's not bad. / - That sounds good.

303
00:11:08,307 --> 00:11:10,840
- It kind of sounds like "swag" in Korean. / - It does.

304
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:14,074
The CG looks great on you.

305
00:11:14,074 --> 00:11:16,807
- It kind of sounds like "swag" in Korean. / - It does.

306
00:11:17,474 --> 00:11:21,440
Our trip to Sichuan will be "really, really good."

307
00:11:22,174 --> 00:11:24,007
Lots to see and lots to eat.

308
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:28,574
(Hello)

309
00:11:28,574 --> 00:11:31,440
- What is that? That's a baby panda. / - Hello.

310
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,174
- Hello. / - A stuffed panda just moved.

311
00:11:34,174 --> 00:11:36,474
I wonder what could top this?

312
00:11:36,874 --> 00:11:37,807
Sichuan...

313
00:11:37,807 --> 00:11:40,774
(The 3 stages of their sightseeing will lure you in)

314
00:11:42,507 --> 00:11:43,674
So cute.

315
00:11:43,674 --> 00:11:46,040
(1st stage, Chengdu Panda Base)

316
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:48,074
I'm so happy right now.

317
00:11:48,074 --> 00:11:49,640
I've been mesmerized.

318
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:51,940
- That looks amazing. / - It looks magnificent.

319
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:53,407
It's time to eat.

320
00:11:56,874 --> 00:11:57,940
I'm hungry.

321
00:11:57,940 --> 00:12:00,440
- I'm getting hungry. / - That was so good.

322
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:02,174
- I'm not lying. / - That stuff makes your mouth numb.

323
00:12:02,174 --> 00:12:03,740
That's so tasty.

324
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:04,840
I'm salivating.

325
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:06,040
What is that?

326
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:07,640
Oh, I ate it again.

327
00:12:09,507 --> 00:12:12,840
Wow, super spicy.

328
00:12:13,574 --> 00:12:14,840
- You added too much. / - Are you alright?

329
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:16,240
- That was really good. / - That's dynamite.

330
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:18,440
- Doesn't that burn your stomach? / - Not at all.

331
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:20,674
- It might ruin her stomach. / - Not one bit.

332
00:12:20,674 --> 00:12:22,374
- It wasn't that spicy. / - I can't eat spicy food.

333
00:12:22,374 --> 00:12:23,907
- The spiciness goes away fast. / - I can't eat spicy food.

334
00:12:23,907 --> 00:12:25,807
Where are we right now?

335
00:12:25,807 --> 00:12:28,340
This is Sichuan.

336
00:12:28,874 --> 00:12:33,807
(Day 2 of the Zhendehao Tour)

337
00:12:34,174 --> 00:12:35,340
(Chengdu in Sichuan)

338
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:37,807
(4-hour flight, 1 hour behind Korea, currency is Yuan)

339
00:12:37,807 --> 00:12:39,940
(220 voltage used and tourists must apply for visas)

340
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:44,707
- We've arrived in Chengdu, Sichuan. / - In Chengdu.

341
00:12:44,707 --> 00:12:47,707
We're on a trip! Here we are!

342
00:12:47,707 --> 00:12:50,174
(The warning for their excitement has been issued)

343
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:52,674
- This is my first time. / - You...

344
00:12:52,674 --> 00:12:54,574
- What do you mean? / - It's my first trip alone...

345
00:12:54,574 --> 00:12:55,707
After giving birth.

346
00:12:55,707 --> 00:12:58,407
- That's so true! / - I'm so happy right now.

347
00:12:58,407 --> 00:13:00,174
- Look at you. / - I'm free!

348
00:13:00,174 --> 00:13:02,274
- That's right. / - You can't help but jump up and down.

349
00:13:02,274 --> 00:13:04,140
- I've only gone on family trips. / - It's hot and humid...

350
00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:05,407
- But I'm happy. / - You are?

351
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:06,407
I'm still happy.

352
00:13:06,407 --> 00:13:07,707
- Let's get a taxi. / - It's late.

353
00:13:07,707 --> 00:13:09,340
- People ought to travel. / - Of course.

354
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:10,807
- This is so awesome. / - She's genuinely excited.

355
00:13:10,807 --> 00:13:13,107
- Go, go, go! / - Go, go, go!

356
00:13:13,907 --> 00:13:16,140
For the past 5 years, I gave birth to 3 kids.

357
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:17,507
- That was my first time... / - The bus looks so cute.

358
00:13:17,507 --> 00:13:20,540
Going on a trip with a friend without my kids.

359
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:24,340
3 kids over 5 years? You're a real patriot, seriously.

360
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:29,474
(It's a bright morning on their second day of the trip)

361
00:13:30,307 --> 00:13:32,974
(A place where the past and the present coexist)

362
00:13:34,574 --> 00:13:38,340
(Chunxi Road, Myeong-dong of Chengdu)

363
00:13:38,907 --> 00:13:42,507
(What is the Zhendehao Tour's first itinerary?)

364
00:13:42,507 --> 00:13:46,040
This is a landmark in Chengdu.

365
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:47,674
- My goodness. / - That over there?

366
00:13:47,674 --> 00:13:49,440
- Pandas are everywhere. / - That shopping mall...

367
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:50,940
Is as big as several soccer stadiums.

368
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:52,740
(Peek-a-boo)

369
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:54,874
What? Shopping is first on our itinerary?

370
00:13:54,874 --> 00:13:56,907
- No way. / - Raeyeon.

371
00:13:57,140 --> 00:13:59,474
When people think about Chengdu in Sichuan...

372
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:02,507
- They think of pandas. / - My goodness!

373
00:14:02,507 --> 00:14:04,540
Chengdu in Sichuan makes you think of pandas.

374
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:07,707
- We'll go see pandas. / - She wore panda earrings.

375
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:10,907
- You'll go see the pandas first? / - Yes.

376
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:13,940
If we buy the tickets at the Panda Base...

377
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:16,307
The line will be long.

378
00:14:16,307 --> 00:14:19,074
But we can buy tickets from there in advance.

379
00:14:19,074 --> 00:14:20,674
This way, we won't wait in line there.

380
00:14:20,674 --> 00:14:22,807
- Right. This is a great tip. / - It's over there.

381
00:14:23,074 --> 00:14:24,774
- These kind of tips are great. / - There it is.

382
00:14:24,774 --> 00:14:27,474
- The bus looks like a panda. / - The panda bus.

383
00:14:27,474 --> 00:14:28,507
It's so cute.

384
00:14:28,507 --> 00:14:30,640
- The bus looks like a panda. / - That bus is adorable.

385
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:33,840
Mr. Driver, you can't doze off here. Excuse me.

386
00:14:34,374 --> 00:14:36,107
You can't doze off here.

387
00:14:36,107 --> 00:14:37,874
Let's buy tickets for the shuttle bus...

388
00:14:37,874 --> 00:14:40,140
- And the admission tickets here. / - Sounds great.

389
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:41,874
(They buy admission tickets to the Panda Base)

390
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:45,374
(She speaks Chinese like a pro)

391
00:14:45,374 --> 00:14:47,340
The round ticket for the shuttle bus

392
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:49,940
and the admission ticket cost 73 yuan per person.

393
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:51,607
We won't have to wait in line. This is awesome.

394
00:14:51,607 --> 00:14:53,840
- Right? / - I bet the line there will be long.

395
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:56,074
- Are we going to see pandas? / - We are.

396
00:14:56,074 --> 00:14:58,274
I really wanted to see them.

397
00:14:58,274 --> 00:15:00,574
This is awesome! This is so awesome!

398
00:15:01,774 --> 00:15:06,340
(30 minutes by bus from Chunxi Road to the habitat)

399
00:15:10,907 --> 00:15:15,474
(The park preserved the ecosystem for wild pandas)

400
00:15:17,174 --> 00:15:19,774
Pandas are the most loved animals by the Chinese.

401
00:15:20,174 --> 00:15:21,940
- Pandas. / - We came here to see the pandas.

402
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:23,640
We came here to meet them.

403
00:15:24,974 --> 00:15:26,440
This is the Chengdu Panda Base.

404
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:29,007
- Here. / - Yes.

405
00:15:29,407 --> 00:15:32,140
(They're wearing panda hair bands)

406
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:34,107
Pandas are breed only in China.

407
00:15:34,107 --> 00:15:35,774
That's why Chinese people

408
00:15:35,774 --> 00:15:38,907
are proud to have pandas in their country.

409
00:15:38,907 --> 00:15:40,674
They give pandas as gift to other countries.

410
00:15:40,674 --> 00:15:43,207
- They rent them out for long terms too. / - Right.

411
00:15:43,207 --> 00:15:44,840
- Aren't they pretty? / - Right.

412
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:45,974
(Pandas in Korea are also from China)

413
00:15:45,974 --> 00:15:47,574
It's very early in the morning...

414
00:15:47,574 --> 00:15:49,074
- But there are a lot of people. / - Seriously.

415
00:15:49,074 --> 00:15:50,307
We didn't wait in line.

416
00:15:50,307 --> 00:15:52,107
- Because you bought them earlier? / - Yes.

417
00:15:52,107 --> 00:15:54,207
- We could enter right away. / - I see.

418
00:15:54,674 --> 00:15:56,340
It's very early in the morning.

419
00:15:56,340 --> 00:15:57,540
- But there are a lot of people. / - Seriously.

420
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:59,907
There were more people earlier.

421
00:15:59,907 --> 00:16:01,074
Here it is.

422
00:16:01,074 --> 00:16:04,340
(Raeyeon gets the map first)

423
00:16:07,874 --> 00:16:09,040
It's quite big.

424
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:12,874
This place is for those newborn baby pandas.

425
00:16:12,974 --> 00:16:15,474
- We can see baby pandas. / - My goodness.

426
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:17,107
Let's start with baby pandas.

427
00:16:17,574 --> 00:16:20,907
It'd be nice to see them in the growing order.

428
00:16:21,374 --> 00:16:23,274
You know what? We've never seen baby pandas.

429
00:16:23,274 --> 00:16:24,440
Right. We only see big ones.

430
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:26,274
Except for when it's on the news

431
00:16:26,274 --> 00:16:28,140
that a baby panda is born.

432
00:16:28,474 --> 00:16:30,407
Yes! Let's go!

433
00:16:30,407 --> 00:16:31,974
I'm so excited.

434
00:16:31,974 --> 00:16:33,140
The pandas...

435
00:16:33,474 --> 00:16:35,407
It's summer here.

436
00:16:35,407 --> 00:16:37,107
If it's too hot, they don't come out.

437
00:16:37,107 --> 00:16:38,474
That's why you should come here in the morning

438
00:16:38,474 --> 00:16:40,340
to see more pandas.

439
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:42,474
That's why even though we came here early,

440
00:16:42,474 --> 00:16:43,574
the park is really crowded.

441
00:16:43,574 --> 00:16:45,140
That many people go to see pandas.

442
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:47,140
It was packed with people.

443
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:48,707
- That was 7 a.m. / - Right.

444
00:16:50,074 --> 00:16:52,707
I feel like we'll get to see many pandas today.

445
00:16:52,707 --> 00:16:55,174
I hope we do. We came all the way here.

446
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:58,607
There are newborn baby pandas.

447
00:16:58,607 --> 00:16:59,707
Let's go see them.

448
00:16:59,707 --> 00:17:01,907
In this park, there are these twin pandas

449
00:17:01,907 --> 00:17:03,207
that were born in 2018.

450
00:17:03,407 --> 00:17:04,607
- Twins? / - They must be so cute.

451
00:17:04,607 --> 00:17:05,640
They were born this year.

452
00:17:05,974 --> 00:17:07,407
Would they be as big as this?

453
00:17:07,474 --> 00:17:08,907
I bet they're tiny like dolls.

454
00:17:08,907 --> 00:17:10,040
(How will wriggling baby pandas look?)

455
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:11,107
Wriggle, wriggle.

456
00:17:14,707 --> 00:17:15,874
My goodness.

457
00:17:16,174 --> 00:17:17,374
(Oh, my heart)

458
00:17:17,374 --> 00:17:18,840
- Why? / - What is it?

459
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:20,607
- Why? / - Are they that cute?

460
00:17:20,607 --> 00:17:21,807
Just take a look.

461
00:17:21,807 --> 00:17:23,974
- They are so cute. / - We weren't exaggerating.

462
00:17:24,474 --> 00:17:25,374
Where are they?

463
00:17:25,374 --> 00:17:26,407
- Where did they go? / - I can't see them.

464
00:17:26,407 --> 00:17:27,774
- Wait. / - Where are they?

465
00:17:28,174 --> 00:17:32,974
How tiny!

466
00:17:32,974 --> 00:17:34,340
- They're as cute as dolls. / - They're like dolls.

467
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:36,040
- Seriously. / - Aren't they the cutest?

468
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:38,307
- They don't look real. / - They're alive, right?

469
00:17:43,074 --> 00:17:44,607
Aren't they the cutest?

470
00:17:44,607 --> 00:17:45,907
They're moving.

471
00:17:45,907 --> 00:17:48,674
(The twins are welcoming the Zhendehao Tour)

472
00:17:53,574 --> 00:17:56,974
- My gosh, unbelievable. / - They're so cute.

473
00:17:56,974 --> 00:17:58,174
They're the cutest.

474
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:01,907
- So cute. / - Look at its legs.

475
00:18:01,907 --> 00:18:03,474
- It's so adorable. / - Seriously cute.

476
00:18:03,474 --> 00:18:05,174
- Look at the paws. / - I want to touch its paws.

477
00:18:05,174 --> 00:18:07,207
- It's so cute. / - I really want to touch them.

478
00:18:07,574 --> 00:18:09,940
No way, they're so cute. They're the cutest.

479
00:18:12,474 --> 00:18:14,140
- Its paws are the cutest. / - It's so cute.

480
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:16,140
- Look at that. / - How cute!

481
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:18,507
- It's stretching its body. / - It's stretching.

482
00:18:18,507 --> 00:18:20,640
- Pandas are so cute. / - They're too cute.

483
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:23,807
Hey, gosh. Look at that.

484
00:18:23,807 --> 00:18:25,774
- That one can't roll over. / - Bye.

485
00:18:25,774 --> 00:18:26,974
Show us your face.

486
00:18:30,074 --> 00:18:31,407
It's saying hello.

487
00:18:31,407 --> 00:18:33,607
- Look. It's waving. / - Bye.

488
00:18:35,074 --> 00:18:37,640
- Gosh, it's so cute. / - It's so adorable.

489
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:39,640
(The hosts and guests fall in love with the baby pandas)

490
00:18:40,274 --> 00:18:42,640
Now, let's go see grown-up pandas.

491
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:44,807
- Get bigger. Good luck. / - Bye.

492
00:18:44,807 --> 00:18:46,107
Get bigger.

493
00:18:53,107 --> 00:18:54,607
(Surprised)

494
00:18:54,607 --> 00:18:56,640
We can't talk here. No talking.

495
00:18:57,374 --> 00:18:59,640
The panda is eating. It's having breakfast.

496
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:01,107
I guess it came out.

497
00:19:01,107 --> 00:19:01,940
(Snap)

498
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,440
(It almost fell over)

499
00:19:06,074 --> 00:19:07,507
He surprised himself.

500
00:19:07,507 --> 00:19:09,640
(Gosh, that was embarrassing)

501
00:19:10,007 --> 00:19:11,507
I see. This one...

502
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:16,240
It was rescued. In 2006, it was rescued from the wild.

503
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:18,874
- So the date of birth is unknown. / - Gosh.

504
00:19:18,874 --> 00:19:20,140
And this is a male panda.

505
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:22,007
The date of birth is unknown.

506
00:19:24,007 --> 00:19:26,407
The panda was just out there and having fun.

507
00:19:26,407 --> 00:19:27,840
- How relaxing. / - People don't get to see him often.

508
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:30,407
- But we were lucky. / - The weather was great.

509
00:19:30,407 --> 00:19:31,774
The weather was cool.

510
00:19:32,274 --> 00:19:34,274
I guess it's delicious. That must be delicious.

511
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:40,540
(He puts on a cute act in front of these ladies)

512
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:42,440
It's itchy, isn't it?

513
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:44,674
It's itchy.

514
00:19:44,674 --> 00:19:45,474
He's climbing up.

515
00:19:45,774 --> 00:19:47,740
Those two are going to meet soon.

516
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:49,040
Is he climbing up?

517
00:19:49,507 --> 00:19:51,640
- It's rare to see pandas move. / - Exactly.

518
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:53,174
On that day, it was a bit cool.

519
00:19:53,174 --> 00:19:54,940
They climb really well.

520
00:19:57,140 --> 00:19:59,540
(I was here first! You go back down!)

521
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:04,174
- He got poked in the eye. / - "Panda Theater."

522
00:20:04,174 --> 00:20:05,674
- What is this? / - These pandas were so funny.

523
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:07,340
What's going on?

524
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:09,974
(The boss and the subordinate have a fierce battle)

525
00:20:11,874 --> 00:20:13,307
(The subordinate chases the boss up the tree)

526
00:20:13,307 --> 00:20:15,474
- He keeps climbing up. / - He climbed up.

527
00:20:15,474 --> 00:20:17,140
- They're goofing around. / - Oh, no.

528
00:20:17,807 --> 00:20:20,707
But they have such cute bottoms.

529
00:20:20,707 --> 00:20:22,207
What if they are kissing each other?

530
00:20:22,207 --> 00:20:23,774
- No, they're not. / - They're fighting?

531
00:20:23,774 --> 00:20:26,574
- It's only big enough for one panda. / - They're slow.

532
00:20:26,874 --> 00:20:29,240
- It's stuck. / - Because they're big.

533
00:20:32,807 --> 00:20:34,740
(The subordinate closes in and gets the upper hand)

534
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:36,007
They are fighting.

535
00:20:36,674 --> 00:20:38,574
- They're having fun. / - I guess that's a good spot.

536
00:20:38,574 --> 00:20:40,074
- I guess so. / - It's stuck.

537
00:20:40,074 --> 00:20:42,307
It got stuck. No, what will it do?

538
00:20:42,307 --> 00:20:43,840
Their fight is so cute.

539
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:45,340
- It looks flustered. / - It's stuck.

540
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:48,907
That one is stuck. Oh, no.

541
00:20:48,907 --> 00:20:51,740
- Its legs are in the air. / - They were dangling.

542
00:20:52,407 --> 00:20:54,407
- Oh, no. / - Oh, dear.

543
00:20:54,407 --> 00:20:56,440
- Oh, no. / - It's stuck. My goodness.

544
00:20:56,674 --> 00:20:59,740
How cute. Its legs are in the air.

545
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:01,907
He chased him away.

546
00:21:02,274 --> 00:21:04,140
Later on...

547
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:05,207
(How dare you? I'll get you later)

548
00:21:06,907 --> 00:21:08,074
He's so relaxed.

549
00:21:08,707 --> 00:21:09,974
He kicked him out in the end.

550
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:13,607
Watching them makes the time fly by.

551
00:21:13,607 --> 00:21:14,840
That's the charm of pandas.

552
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:16,240
- They're charming indeed. / - Right.

553
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:17,307
We saw pandas...

554
00:21:17,307 --> 00:21:19,174
- In different age groups. / - Right.

555
00:21:19,174 --> 00:21:21,607
Now, let's go see the dyed pandas.

556
00:21:21,607 --> 00:21:23,140
Let's go see the pandas after the hair salon.

557
00:21:23,374 --> 00:21:24,674
- Pardon? / - Lesser pandas.

558
00:21:24,674 --> 00:21:26,240
- What are red pandas? / - Do you know them?

559
00:21:26,274 --> 00:21:28,240
Wait, that master was a panda too?

560
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:29,407
(Red pandas are known through "Kung Fu Panda")

561
00:21:30,007 --> 00:21:32,607
(How will they look in real life?)

562
00:21:34,374 --> 00:21:35,574
I thought we wouldn't see them.

563
00:21:35,574 --> 00:21:36,407
Aren't they raccoons?

564
00:21:36,407 --> 00:21:37,874
I heard it's hard to spot them.

565
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:40,774
There it is. Can you see it? Look over there.

566
00:21:40,874 --> 00:21:42,440
- My goodness. I can see it. / - You can see it, right?

567
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:43,674
- It's my first time seeing one. / - Huh?

568
00:21:43,674 --> 00:21:45,607
- Isn't that a raccoon? / - It's really cute.

569
00:21:45,607 --> 00:21:47,407
- That's also a panda? / - Yes, it is.

570
00:21:47,407 --> 00:21:48,640
Really?

571
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:49,940
- I thought it was a raccoon. / - It looks like a raccoon.

572
00:21:50,907 --> 00:21:52,407
How far will you climb up?

573
00:21:55,307 --> 00:21:56,974
(Dangling)

574
00:21:58,340 --> 00:22:00,907
My gosh, all these people are worried about you.

575
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:04,840
(Laughing)

576
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:06,074
Goodness.

577
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:08,274
I thought it was going to fall off.

578
00:22:08,274 --> 00:22:09,607
This one doesn't look chubby.

579
00:22:09,607 --> 00:22:11,374
- Oh, my. / - It's so cute.

580
00:22:11,374 --> 00:22:12,940
I didn't know it was a panda.

581
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:16,674
By the way, the color is quite unique.

582
00:22:16,674 --> 00:22:19,007
They're not locked up like in a zoo.

583
00:22:19,007 --> 00:22:21,274
The whole park is their base.

584
00:22:21,274 --> 00:22:23,774
It's as if the people are locked up.

585
00:22:23,774 --> 00:22:27,507
So you never know where they'll turn up...

586
00:22:27,507 --> 00:22:29,174
- Inside the forest. / - That's so cute.

587
00:22:29,174 --> 00:22:31,407
- Seriously. / - That one is intriguing.

588
00:22:31,874 --> 00:22:33,774
- Its tail is so straight. / - So this is red panda.

589
00:22:34,507 --> 00:22:36,640
This is our first trip.

590
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:39,274
- You said you would... / - Yes?

591
00:22:39,274 --> 00:22:40,507
Research the restaurants.

592
00:22:40,507 --> 00:22:41,640
Since we're in Sichuan...

593
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:43,474
- We'll enjoy spicy food. / - Okay.

594
00:22:43,474 --> 00:22:44,940
It's the first stage of the spicy food.

595
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:46,674
- Like in different levels? / - Yes.

596
00:22:46,674 --> 00:22:49,040
- Let's go eat our meal first! / - Go, go!

597
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:50,907
- Go, go. Let's go. / - Let's go.

598
00:22:52,774 --> 00:22:57,374
(30 minutes by car to Kuan Zhai Xiang Zi)

599
00:22:57,374 --> 00:22:59,974
- I'm hungry. / - If we continue on this alley...

600
00:22:59,974 --> 00:23:02,607
We'll be at the restaurant you told me about.

601
00:23:03,607 --> 00:23:06,540
This restaurant name means "Come enjoy our food."

602
00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:07,907
- Really? / - So funny, yes.

603
00:23:08,407 --> 00:23:09,740
(Sights, Food)

604
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:10,807
(Food)

605
00:23:10,807 --> 00:23:12,840
(Dandan noodles)

606
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:14,974
- Dandan noodles. / - Dandan noodles are delicious.

607
00:23:14,974 --> 00:23:17,440
(Dandan noodles)

608
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:19,940
- That looks good. / - Doesn't it usually have soup?

609
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:21,940
- They're stir-fried in Sichuan. / - Right.

610
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:23,807
- Originally, the dish is... / - This isn't a soup dish.

611
00:23:24,074 --> 00:23:27,374
People say that when in Sichuan, eat dandan noodles.

612
00:23:27,707 --> 00:23:28,807
People say that.

613
00:23:28,807 --> 00:23:30,807
So, the spiciness level...

614
00:23:31,107 --> 00:23:33,207
- Level 1? / - Level 1? Okay.

615
00:23:33,207 --> 00:23:34,807
I'll trust you with food.

616
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:38,074
Because Mr. Baek has your back.

617
00:23:38,074 --> 00:23:41,374
He explained the origin to me.

618
00:23:41,374 --> 00:23:44,140
I was recording him to listen to it.

619
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:46,307
- It's a video. / - Yes.

620
00:23:46,307 --> 00:23:49,674
When you go to a restaurant...

621
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:52,007
- What's he doing? / - My daughter...

622
00:23:53,607 --> 00:23:54,940
He's dressing a doll.

623
00:23:56,074 --> 00:23:57,607
I've never seen him like that.

624
00:23:57,607 --> 00:23:59,374
He's busy dressing a doll.

625
00:23:59,374 --> 00:24:01,540
You can't ask him this stuff when he's busy like that.

626
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:03,707
- He loves it when I ask. / - Does he?

627
00:24:04,307 --> 00:24:05,740
Dandan noodles means to carry...

628
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:06,807
Dandan noodles.

629
00:24:06,807 --> 00:24:10,640
That's why it's called dandan noodles.

630
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:13,174
How well they use the chili oil is very important.

631
00:24:13,174 --> 00:24:15,407
The use of chili oil is very important.

632
00:24:16,707 --> 00:24:19,674
Dandan means "to carry."

633
00:24:19,674 --> 00:24:21,574
In the past, the vendors carried

634
00:24:21,574 --> 00:24:26,140
the noodles and the ingredients to sell them...

635
00:24:26,140 --> 00:24:27,874
- On the street. / - Dandan noodles.

636
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:30,740
Also, suan la something.

637
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:32,107
- Oh, suan la fen. / - The sour...

638
00:24:32,107 --> 00:24:34,740
- It's dumplings with sauce. / - I like that.

639
00:24:34,774 --> 00:24:36,007
(Finished ordering)

640
00:24:36,007 --> 00:24:37,340
Good? Like this.

641
00:24:38,674 --> 00:24:41,374
(Chewy boiled noodles)

642
00:24:41,374 --> 00:24:42,540
Even if you can't speak Chinese...

643
00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:46,707
- If you order what I showed you, / - Chili oil.

644
00:24:47,307 --> 00:24:49,340
- That'd be enough. / - It'll suit our taste.

645
00:24:49,807 --> 00:24:52,107
(Dandan noodles, $3)

646
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:58,674
(A charming sour and spicy dish, suan la fen)

647
00:25:00,207 --> 00:25:02,640
(Raeyeon's recommendation, dumplings)

648
00:25:03,340 --> 00:25:06,674
Finally, dandan noodles are here.

649
00:25:06,674 --> 00:25:09,707
- Chili oil is at the bottom. / - Chili oil is important.

650
00:25:09,707 --> 00:25:11,074

00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:20,207
- It kind of looks like black bean noodles. / - Yes.

655
00:25:20,207 --> 00:25:21,507
- It does. / - Here we go.

656
00:25:21,507 --> 00:25:23,540
(How will the original dandan noodles taste?)

657
00:25:32,274 --> 00:25:36,507
(Slurping)

658
00:25:36,507 --> 00:25:38,774
I can smell the mala sauce right away

659
00:25:38,774 --> 00:25:40,640
but I'm not repulsed by it.

660
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,240
It looks bland.

661
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:43,840
It doesn't look good but it's full of flavor.

662
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:46,074
That looks really good.

663
00:25:46,074 --> 00:25:47,140
It's really good.

664
00:25:47,874 --> 00:25:49,740
It's tasty and spicy.

665
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:51,007
It looks really good.

666
00:25:52,407 --> 00:25:54,307
(Dandan noodles have a strong flavor)

667
00:25:54,307 --> 00:25:57,240
The peanut sauce neutralizes the spicy flavor.

668
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:59,807
Even if you can't handle spicy food...

669
00:25:59,807 --> 00:26:00,807
It's red but not spicy at all.

670
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:08,107
(Dandan noodles are slightly spicy)

671
00:26:08,107 --> 00:26:10,574
- Is it like mixed noodles? / - Yes, it is.

672
00:26:10,574 --> 00:26:11,874
It's like black bean noodles.

673
00:26:13,540 --> 00:26:14,974
Goodness.

674
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:17,440
It's delicious.

675
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:18,840
Try the suan la fen.

676
00:26:19,274 --> 00:26:21,207
- Suan la fen. / - Suan la fen?

677
00:26:21,207 --> 00:26:23,440
Suan means "sour" and la means "spicy."

678
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:26,640
Suan la fen. Fen means "glass noodles."

679
00:26:27,274 --> 00:26:29,307
- I tried it before. / - It's like kimchi stew.

680
00:26:29,674 --> 00:26:31,507
Kimchi stew is a bit sour.

681
00:26:31,507 --> 00:26:32,807
It's like kimchi stew.

682
00:26:32,807 --> 00:26:34,374
Kind of like spicy meat soup.

683
00:26:34,374 --> 00:26:35,774
It's health food.

684
00:26:35,774 --> 00:26:37,340
(Suan la fen, $2)

685
00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:38,640
That's interesting.

686
00:26:42,874 --> 00:26:45,740
- It goes down so easily. / - Yes.

687
00:26:45,740 --> 00:26:47,540
This is great for stimulating your appetite.

688
00:26:48,574 --> 00:26:50,474
This glass noodles didn't get soggy, did they?

689
00:26:50,474 --> 00:26:52,374
- They're like that. / - This is the original texture.

690
00:26:52,374 --> 00:26:53,940
It's very similar to glass noodles we know.

691
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:57,840
(Familiar, yet strange look and texture)

692
00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:01,474
I thought it'd be really spicy.

693
00:27:01,474 --> 00:27:03,174
- It is the level 1. / - Yes.

694
00:27:03,174 --> 00:27:06,107
It's not super spicy.

695
00:27:06,107 --> 00:27:07,574
This is great for people

696
00:27:07,574 --> 00:27:09,074
who are trying spicy Sichuan food for the first time.

697
00:27:09,074 --> 00:27:10,007
(A good starting point for beginners)

698
00:27:10,174 --> 00:27:12,807
- Is it spicy? / - It is, but it's sour.

699
00:27:12,807 --> 00:27:15,707
It's less spicier than instant noodles.

700
00:27:17,874 --> 00:27:19,074
Dumplings.

701
00:27:19,474 --> 00:27:20,574
Boiled dumplings.

702
00:27:21,807 --> 00:27:23,007
(Staring)

703
00:27:23,007 --> 00:27:25,207
You have to eat dumplings in China.

704
00:27:25,940 --> 00:27:26,907
I'm hungry.

705
00:27:27,407 --> 00:27:29,474
This shows that we're in Sichuan.

706
00:27:30,407 --> 00:27:31,574
You can tell right away.

707
00:27:31,574 --> 00:27:32,607
"This is Sichuan."

708
00:27:33,474 --> 00:27:35,107
(This is Sichuan!)

709
00:27:35,107 --> 00:27:35,940
- I see. / - The sauce.

710
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:39,040
- You dip the dumpling in the sauce. / - Chili oil.

711
00:27:39,507 --> 00:27:41,140
It's Sichuan red oil dumplings.

712
00:27:41,140 --> 00:27:42,574
You dip it in sauce and eat it.

713
00:27:44,807 --> 00:27:46,607
(Gosh)

714
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:50,007
(Yujin, who's in charge of food, is nervous)

715
00:27:50,007 --> 00:27:52,107
I'm angry.

716
00:27:52,674 --> 00:27:55,507
Why don't people know about this?

717
00:27:57,807 --> 00:27:59,940
- She's angry. / - It tastes so good.

718
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:02,340
- That sauce is so good. / - The dumpling is good too.

719
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:04,707
- The skin is delicious. / - The pork inside.

720
00:28:05,107 --> 00:28:07,140
- No vegetables? Just meat? / - Yes.

721
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:08,507
- Without sauce. / - It's so good.

722
00:28:08,507 --> 00:28:10,007
I love meat dumplings.

723
00:28:10,007 --> 00:28:12,007
That looks pretty inside.

724
00:28:12,007 --> 00:28:14,140
- It's so good. / - Goodness.

725
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:17,707
The skin and the stuffing go so well together.

726
00:28:19,674 --> 00:28:21,074
I think I can eat 100 of them right now.

727
00:28:21,074 --> 00:28:23,574
- Seriously, I can. / - Right on the spot.

728
00:28:30,374 --> 00:28:31,440
(It makes me angry)

729
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:34,407
The dumpling tastes perfect with the sauce.

730
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:36,507
This is no. 1 out of the 3 dishes.

731
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:39,274
(Who are you by the way?)

732
00:28:40,674 --> 00:28:42,007
For your daughters?

733
00:28:42,007 --> 00:28:43,374
(They dropped by a souvenir shop)

734
00:28:43,374 --> 00:28:45,174
- It's a panda wearing a mask. / - It's so cute.

735
00:28:45,174 --> 00:28:46,307
- Isn't it cute? / - Yes.

736
00:28:46,307 --> 00:28:47,474
It's wearing blush.

737
00:28:48,740 --> 00:28:50,474
- It's cute. / - It is.

738
00:28:50,474 --> 00:28:52,174
- This is the Zhendehao Tour. / - Yes.

739
00:28:52,174 --> 00:28:55,074
If something was fun, we'll take this panda out.

740
00:28:56,140 --> 00:28:58,607
"Really good!" We'll express it with the panda.

741
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:03,140
Zhendehao Tour's spiciness level 1.

742
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:04,640
- Open it if it was delicious. / - Okay.

743
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:06,574
- Alright? Be honest. / - I am.

744
00:29:06,574 --> 00:29:10,040
- 1, 2, 3. / - 1, 2, 3.

745
00:29:11,107 --> 00:29:12,707
Should I call it harmonious?

746
00:29:13,774 --> 00:29:14,840
It makes me angry.

747
00:29:17,140 --> 00:29:18,740
(What will be the fate of the panda?)

748
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:20,507
- So if you like it, you open the lens? / - Yes.

749
00:29:21,607 --> 00:29:23,174
Really good.

750
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:27,140
(Really good)

751
00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:29,807
I'm so happy.

752
00:29:30,174 --> 00:29:32,240
- What will we do? / - Now that we ate...

753
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:33,840
Have you ever had your ears cleaned?

754
00:29:34,607 --> 00:29:36,574
- Ears? / - Yes. Do you do it yourself?

755
00:29:36,574 --> 00:29:37,874
Yes, I do.

756
00:29:37,874 --> 00:29:40,907
Here, there are professional ear cleaners.

757
00:29:40,907 --> 00:29:42,074
They clean your ears.

758
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:44,807
- Do you think it's weird? / - I've never done it.

759
00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:46,174
It feels so good.

760
00:29:46,174 --> 00:29:48,340
After we do it, don't ask to do it again.

761
00:29:48,807 --> 00:29:50,374
(Sights, Food)

762
00:29:50,374 --> 00:29:51,407
(Sights)

763
00:29:51,407 --> 00:29:54,674
(Kuan Zhai Xiang Zi)

764
00:29:54,807 --> 00:29:58,207
- That was good. / - It was delicious.

765
00:29:58,607 --> 00:29:59,907
There are more people.

766
00:29:59,907 --> 00:30:01,840
- You're right. / - There are more people.

767
00:30:02,674 --> 00:30:04,740
This is Kuan Zhai Xiang Zi.

768
00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:06,374
Kwan means "broad," zhai means "narrow,"

769
00:30:06,374 --> 00:30:08,440
and xiang zi means "alley."

770
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:10,907
This is like Insa-dong in Korea.

771
00:30:10,907 --> 00:30:12,340
- Doesn't it look great? / - Goodness.

772
00:30:12,340 --> 00:30:13,940
- It looks amazing. / - Nice.

773
00:30:13,940 --> 00:30:15,107
It looks historical.

774
00:30:15,107 --> 00:30:16,707
Let's go there together someday.

775
00:30:16,707 --> 00:30:18,874
That place is really amazing.

776
00:30:18,874 --> 00:30:19,940
(Experiencing old China in the city)

777
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:28,174
- This is like paradise. / - Really?

778
00:30:28,974 --> 00:30:30,007
Because we can...

779
00:30:30,307 --> 00:30:33,407
Shop and eat great food here.

780
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:41,574
(Kuan Zhai Xiang Zi is a popular place full of people)

781
00:30:47,774 --> 00:30:49,440
What's great about this place is

782
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:50,874
that everything has a fixed price.

783
00:30:50,874 --> 00:30:53,340
So you don't have to barter.

784
00:30:53,340 --> 00:30:54,607
Bartering is tiring.

785
00:30:54,807 --> 00:30:55,740
You don't have to do that.

786
00:30:55,740 --> 00:30:57,040
- That's great. / - It's all set out.

787
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:58,707
- Because it's a designated tourist area. / - Right.

788
00:30:59,507 --> 00:31:03,607
(China's old traditions have been preserved here)

789
00:31:03,607 --> 00:31:05,907
- That's an instrument. / - It really looks like China.

790
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:08,574
(There are so many things to see)

791
00:31:08,574 --> 00:31:10,040
- Are those noodles? / - Yes.

792
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:12,007
Awesome.

793
00:31:12,007 --> 00:31:13,807
- He looks hot. / - What?

794
00:31:13,807 --> 00:31:15,307
- Look at his face. / - So cool.

795
00:31:15,307 --> 00:31:16,540
Goodness, what's that?

796
00:31:18,140 --> 00:31:19,940
There are lots to see, along with the food.

797
00:31:19,940 --> 00:31:21,607
Yes, it's fun to watch.

798
00:31:21,607 --> 00:31:23,507
As you walk along, it's so entertaining.

799
00:31:24,907 --> 00:31:27,907
We just walked down the wide street.

800
00:31:27,907 --> 00:31:30,940
Now, when we turn left, and it's the narrow street.

801
00:31:31,540 --> 00:31:32,574
It has a different atmosphere.

802
00:31:32,874 --> 00:31:34,940
- Wide and narrow street. / - That street is really narrow.

803
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:38,807
We took pictures in the narrow street.

804
00:31:38,807 --> 00:31:39,640
(Where are they off to next?)

805
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:41,174
Ta-da.

806
00:31:41,374 --> 00:31:43,374
- What is that? / - Ta-da. We're here.

807
00:31:44,874 --> 00:31:47,274
- Just on the street. / - Just like that.

808
00:31:47,274 --> 00:31:49,307
There are so many on the street.

809
00:31:50,140 --> 00:31:51,274
This is the place.

810
00:31:51,274 --> 00:31:53,840
Is this where we get our ears cleaned? Outdoors?

811
00:31:54,274 --> 00:31:55,607
- It was outdoors? / - They're...

812
00:31:55,607 --> 00:31:57,507
Normally outside like this.

813
00:31:57,507 --> 00:31:59,474
- Sit down. / - I'm taken aback.

814
00:31:59,474 --> 00:32:01,740
People are passing by.

815
00:32:03,574 --> 00:32:04,974
He'll clean your ears.

816
00:32:05,907 --> 00:32:07,040
I'm scared.

817
00:32:07,340 --> 00:32:08,374
- Are you scared? / - It's hot.

818
00:32:08,374 --> 00:32:09,907
Yes. I've never done this before.

819
00:32:10,974 --> 00:32:13,307
- Oh, my. / - He's so cool.

820
00:32:13,507 --> 00:32:15,274
- He's very serious. / - Yes.

821
00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:19,107
This kind of gives you goose bumps. It's not hot.

822
00:32:21,107 --> 00:32:23,074
- He has a lot of tools. / - Yujin got scared.

823
00:32:23,074 --> 00:32:25,074
I was really scared in the beginning.

824
00:32:25,074 --> 00:32:26,874
(She's touched by the famous ear cleaning)

825
00:32:26,874 --> 00:32:28,207
I can hear it.

826
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:29,740
Isn't it nice?

827
00:32:30,674 --> 00:32:31,674
What?

828
00:32:32,074 --> 00:32:34,807
- Isn't it nice? / - I shouldn't speak loudly.

829
00:32:35,074 --> 00:32:36,207
(Laughing)

830
00:32:36,207 --> 00:32:38,240
- It's like ventriloquism. / - You can talk.

831
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:41,940
If I do, my jaw will move

832
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:43,707
and it'll affect my ear cleaning.

833
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:47,540
When I take my kids to the doctor and

834
00:32:47,540 --> 00:32:49,707
when they get scared of getting their ears cleaned...

835
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:52,674
I scolded them. But this is scary.

836
00:32:53,207 --> 00:32:54,540
I understand how they feel now.

837
00:32:54,874 --> 00:32:56,107
Can you ask them

838
00:32:56,107 --> 00:32:59,040
if anyone bled while doing this?

839
00:33:02,707 --> 00:33:05,774
Never. And they've been doing this for 12 years.

840
00:33:05,774 --> 00:33:07,174
Relax. 12 years.

841
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:10,074
- What's that? / - What is that?

842
00:33:10,474 --> 00:33:11,940
- Is it acupuncture? / - He's doing something.

843
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:13,974
- What's that? / - What is that?

844
00:33:14,007 --> 00:33:15,874
- He said it's a massage. / - Wait a minute.

845
00:33:15,974 --> 00:33:18,074
- Seriously, inside the ear... / - Wait.

846
00:33:18,074 --> 00:33:20,174
He's massaging the inside of the ear.

847
00:33:20,207 --> 00:33:21,540
You can feel all that.

848
00:33:21,540 --> 00:33:22,407
(The inside of the ear is massaged through vibration)

849
00:33:24,140 --> 00:33:25,640
He's not budging.

850
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:27,007
(It's my ear but I can't control it)

851
00:33:27,007 --> 00:33:29,374
- She can't quit now. / - He's already started.

852
00:33:30,107 --> 00:33:32,707
I just heard a drill in my ear.

853
00:33:33,374 --> 00:33:35,107
(Fascinated)

854
00:33:35,107 --> 00:33:37,240
- It looks interesting. / - It trembles.

855
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:38,740
- It feels really good. / - Doesn't it tickle?

856
00:33:38,740 --> 00:33:39,974
It feels really good.

857
00:33:41,207 --> 00:33:42,674
It seems like he's done with one ear.

858
00:33:44,507 --> 00:33:46,807
(He's getting ready to clean the other ear)

859
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:49,474
His expression doesn't change.

860
00:33:49,474 --> 00:33:50,774
She seems like she has given up.

861
00:33:50,774 --> 00:33:53,607
I think I should go get a neck massage after this.

862
00:33:53,607 --> 00:33:55,174
I'm straining my neck.

863
00:33:55,174 --> 00:33:58,274
Once you try it, you'll love it.

864
00:33:58,274 --> 00:33:59,574
It feels really good.

865
00:34:00,540 --> 00:34:01,740
I love it.

866
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:02,974
(She looks uptight even from a distance)

867
00:34:03,774 --> 00:34:05,407
He stuck something in my ear.

868
00:34:05,407 --> 00:34:06,240
(Peaceful)

869
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:09,407
No, no, no.

870
00:34:10,574 --> 00:34:11,774
My goodness.

871
00:34:13,574 --> 00:34:16,274
(Anyway, the extreme ear cleaning is over)

872
00:34:16,940 --> 00:34:18,040
I love it.

873
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:19,440
(Her soul is cleaned away together with her earwax)

874
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:20,540
Thank you.

875
00:34:21,374 --> 00:34:22,640
So, how was the earwax cleaning?

876
00:34:23,507 --> 00:34:26,307
To me, it's obvious. 1, 2, 3.

877
00:34:28,374 --> 00:34:30,540
(Really)

878
00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:33,174
- Really. / - Then, let's keep this one closed.

879
00:34:33,174 --> 00:34:36,307
Let's open this one. Good.

880
00:34:36,307 --> 00:34:38,607
I'd recommend this for a special experience.

881
00:34:38,607 --> 00:34:40,307
I'd recommend this for an experience

882
00:34:40,307 --> 00:34:42,974
but right after, you have to go get a neck massage.

883
00:34:42,974 --> 00:34:44,574
I admit some people might not like it

884
00:34:44,574 --> 00:34:46,874
but I love it. I like it so much.

885
00:34:46,874 --> 00:34:49,407
It's nice but for those who try it for the first time,

886
00:34:49,407 --> 00:34:50,474
they might not like it too much.

887
00:34:50,474 --> 00:34:52,607
- Okay. / - They can be nervous.

888
00:34:52,607 --> 00:34:55,174
- I understand. / - Just relax if you do it.

889
00:34:55,174 --> 00:34:57,074
I like how it turned out in the end.

890
00:34:57,607 --> 00:34:59,007
It's very interesting.

891
00:34:59,007 --> 00:35:00,807
- She looks very relaxed. / - She does.

892
00:35:01,274 --> 00:35:02,674
(They walk around the narrow alleyways)

893
00:35:02,674 --> 00:35:04,974
There is an alley here as well. There are stores.

894
00:35:05,807 --> 00:35:08,440
I love this street.

895
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:11,240
Do you know the sauce for mala hot pot?

896
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:13,840
- I know. / - They're selling the sauce here.

897
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:15,874
This is very spicy and this is a little spicy.

898
00:35:15,874 --> 00:35:17,407
I'd like the one that is a little spicy.

899
00:35:17,974 --> 00:35:19,740
(They purchased the soup for hot pot)

900
00:35:21,107 --> 00:35:22,674
(Only 10 steps away from the store)

901
00:35:22,674 --> 00:35:24,140
What is this?

902
00:35:27,774 --> 00:35:29,107
This is a plum tea.

903
00:35:29,340 --> 00:35:30,740
- Would you like to try it? / - Yes.

904
00:35:30,740 --> 00:35:32,907
- Try it. / - It's interesting.

905
00:35:32,907 --> 00:35:34,107
This was really good.

906
00:35:34,107 --> 00:35:35,674
- The plum tea? / - Yes.

907
00:35:35,674 --> 00:35:38,074
All the staff tried this and said it's really good.

908
00:35:40,407 --> 00:35:42,074
- This is exactly what I wanted. / - Is it?

909
00:35:42,074 --> 00:35:43,807
- It's not too sweet either. / - No.

910
00:35:43,807 --> 00:35:45,540
After you eat a lot of greasy food

911
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:47,507
in a fancy restaurant,

912
00:35:47,507 --> 00:35:49,440
you get a small glass of plum tea.

913
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:52,040
It's not too sweet. It has a clean taste.

914
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:55,607
- I really like this. / - I really like this too.

915
00:35:56,407 --> 00:35:57,607
This is a chrysanthemum tea.

916
00:35:57,607 --> 00:36:01,074
If you put this in the water,

917
00:36:01,074 --> 00:36:01,807
the flower blooms in it.

918
00:36:01,807 --> 00:36:05,074
If you serve this to the elderly...

919
00:36:05,074 --> 00:36:07,707
- They will love it. / - Exactly.

920
00:36:07,707 --> 00:36:10,674
Saying, "This is chrysanthemum tea."

921
00:36:10,674 --> 00:36:12,874
- It's so pretty. / - It is.

922
00:36:12,874 --> 00:36:15,740
- You're shopping a lot. / - We did a lot.

923
00:36:15,740 --> 00:36:17,307
What is this?

924
00:36:17,674 --> 00:36:19,340
(Let's see)

925
00:36:19,674 --> 00:36:21,207
The one in the front is pudding

926
00:36:21,207 --> 00:36:22,507
and those are rabbit heads.

927
00:36:23,340 --> 00:36:25,274
- What? / - Rabbit heads?

928
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:26,974
- It has teeth. / - Yes?

929
00:36:26,974 --> 00:36:28,907
There were all kinds of heads.

930
00:36:28,907 --> 00:36:31,074
- Rabbit heads? / - They are the teeth, right?

931
00:36:31,074 --> 00:36:32,807
Yes, they are.

932
00:36:32,807 --> 00:36:34,040
(Culture shock)

933
00:36:35,274 --> 00:36:37,940
(What did they find?)

934
00:36:37,940 --> 00:36:40,440
- Hey, look at that. / - It's a pig.

935
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:42,307
It's a pig's nose.

936
00:36:42,807 --> 00:36:43,274
It's a pig's nose.

937
00:36:43,274 --> 00:36:44,907
Why are there spring onions in it?

938
00:36:44,907 --> 00:36:47,307
There is only one nose...

939
00:36:47,307 --> 00:36:48,607
- Per pig. / - Only one.

940
00:36:48,607 --> 00:36:50,307
It's a limited edition.

941
00:36:50,307 --> 00:36:51,507
A pig's nose?

942
00:36:51,507 --> 00:36:52,840
(Should I try it?)

943
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:54,274
- How about we share it? / - Should we try it?

944
00:36:54,274 --> 00:36:56,740
- It looks interesting. / - It could be chewy.

945
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:03,540
My gosh, I can't believe I'm trying a pig's nose.

946
00:37:03,540 --> 00:37:05,940
- Take a picture of me. / - 1, 2, 3.

947
00:37:09,207 --> 00:37:11,274
- Looks good on her. / - They wanted to take pictures.

948
00:37:12,074 --> 00:37:13,340
They look good with it.

949
00:37:16,174 --> 00:37:17,374
Look at that.

950
00:37:22,174 --> 00:37:23,207
Thank you.

951
00:37:23,207 --> 00:37:26,507
So, this is how it looks when it's sliced.

952
00:37:28,174 --> 00:37:30,440
(They boldly take a piece)

953
00:37:31,774 --> 00:37:32,974
I think some might not like this.

954
00:37:32,974 --> 00:37:34,607
That's not true. Everyone will like it.

955
00:37:34,607 --> 00:37:36,607
- Really? / - Everyone will like it?

956
00:37:36,607 --> 00:37:37,607
It tastes like pig's head.

957
00:37:37,607 --> 00:37:41,940
It's a lot more chewy than the pork hocks.

958
00:37:41,940 --> 00:37:45,140
Some people only like the chewy part with pork hocks.

959
00:37:45,140 --> 00:37:47,140
It's like a collection of the chewy parts.

960
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:49,140
I heard it's way chewier and tastier than...

961
00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:51,207
- The chewy pork hock rind. / - You're right.

962
00:37:51,207 --> 00:37:53,307
It's the pure chewiness itself.

963
00:37:53,774 --> 00:37:55,107
- It's tasty. / - Is it?

964
00:37:55,107 --> 00:37:56,007
Yes.

965
00:37:56,007 --> 00:37:57,640
I think it's worth trying.

966
00:37:57,640 --> 00:38:00,340
This is definitely worth a try. And you should...

967
00:38:01,007 --> 00:38:02,574
Ask for the sauce.

968
00:38:02,574 --> 00:38:04,840
You want the spicy sauce.

969
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:07,274
- Spicy sauce. / - So that's the sauce.

970
00:38:08,607 --> 00:38:11,474
It's similar to the instant noodle base.

971
00:38:11,474 --> 00:38:13,907
Is it similar to the spice we eat with lamb skewers?

972
00:38:13,907 --> 00:38:16,074
It's a little different. It's less salty.

973
00:38:16,074 --> 00:38:17,174
Right?

974
00:38:17,174 --> 00:38:20,807
How was the pig's nose? 1, 2, 3.

975
00:38:20,807 --> 00:38:22,540
- Really good! / - Really good!

976
00:38:22,774 --> 00:38:24,140
Yujin opened it too.

977
00:38:24,140 --> 00:38:25,807
- It was really tasty. / - It's so chewy.

978
00:38:25,807 --> 00:38:28,607
It suits perfectly to my taste. It's so chewy.

979
00:38:29,207 --> 00:38:31,540
(Really good)

980
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:34,674
- I'm hungry. / - We've been sightseeing a lot.

981
00:38:34,674 --> 00:38:38,107
- It's about time to eat. / - Level 2 of the spicy food.

982
00:38:38,507 --> 00:38:42,940
(15 minutes by foot to the mapo tofu restaurant)

983
00:38:42,940 --> 00:38:44,574
This is the typical dish of Sichuan.

984
00:38:44,574 --> 00:38:49,574
I asked my husband for the recommendation.

985
00:38:49,574 --> 00:38:51,107
I'm very confident.

986
00:38:51,340 --> 00:38:53,274
(She's confident)

987
00:38:54,074 --> 00:38:54,740
You won't be disappointed.

988
00:38:54,740 --> 00:38:56,474
It's a food trip.

989
00:38:56,474 --> 00:38:58,740
I'd like to go on such a trip too.

990
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:00,407
(Sights, Food)

991
00:39:00,407 --> 00:39:01,574
(Food)

992
00:39:01,574 --> 00:39:04,807
(Mapo tofu)

993
00:39:05,174 --> 00:39:07,374
- I smell something extraordinary. / - Me too.

994
00:39:07,374 --> 00:39:08,740
Of course, we should try mapo tofu.

995
00:39:08,740 --> 00:39:09,407
We're in Sichuan.

996
00:39:09,407 --> 00:39:11,607
- Exactly. / - Is this restaurant famous for it?

997
00:39:11,607 --> 00:39:14,307
That's what I heard. It's my first time here as well.

998
00:39:14,307 --> 00:39:16,407
I was told I must visit this place.

999
00:39:17,140 --> 00:39:18,674
Thank you.

1000
00:39:19,307 --> 00:39:20,940
Are we ordering mapo tofu only?

1001
00:39:20,940 --> 00:39:24,040
No, we should order something else too.

1002
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:26,174
I heard there's something I must try here.

1003
00:39:26,174 --> 00:39:27,040
Do you what it is?

1004
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:28,440
You mean the one that was written on the sign

1005
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:30,707
in front of the restaurant? Fuqi feipian.

1006
00:39:31,874 --> 00:39:33,974
I heard that and mapo tofu

1007
00:39:33,974 --> 00:39:35,740
are the representative dishes of Sichuan.

1008
00:39:36,174 --> 00:39:37,974
I was recommended to try something else as well.

1009
00:39:37,974 --> 00:39:39,507
- Kung pao chicken. / - We had that at your house.

1010
00:39:39,507 --> 00:39:40,540
Yes.

1011
00:39:40,940 --> 00:39:44,174
Okay. Let's try the dishes...

1012
00:39:44,540 --> 00:39:45,940
Mr. Baek recommended.

1013
00:39:46,274 --> 00:39:47,907
What is fuqi feipian?

1014
00:39:47,907 --> 00:39:49,307
Fuqi means "a couple" and

1015
00:39:49,307 --> 00:39:54,307
feipian means "sliced boiled intestines."

1016
00:39:55,207 --> 00:39:56,374
It's coming.

1017
00:39:56,374 --> 00:39:58,974
(What's their first dish?)

1018
00:40:00,474 --> 00:40:02,374
- It's served. / - This is fuqi feipian.

1019
00:40:03,807 --> 00:40:05,540
It looks amazing.

1020
00:40:06,207 --> 00:40:09,207
- So this is it. / - Yes, it's fuqi feipian.

1021
00:40:09,207 --> 00:40:10,407
Fuqi feipian.

1022
00:40:10,574 --> 00:40:12,140
It's one of the 100 traditional Chinese dishes.

1023
00:40:12,140 --> 00:40:13,807
- Chinese people must love this. / - Yes.

1024
00:40:13,807 --> 00:40:15,707
My family always eats this on Seollal.

1025
00:40:15,707 --> 00:40:16,840
(Typical dish of Sichuan made with different meats)

1026
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:18,207
It looks delicious.

1027
00:40:20,140 --> 00:40:23,240
(Fuqi feipian, $5.70)

1028
00:40:23,907 --> 00:40:25,374
I can't wait to try.

1029
00:40:25,807 --> 00:40:26,774
It looks like intestines.

1030
00:40:26,774 --> 00:40:32,207
This is like the meat in the intestine soup in Korea.

1031
00:40:32,207 --> 00:40:34,607
- This is tripe. / - Tripe.

1032
00:40:34,607 --> 00:40:37,007
There is the beef heart.

1033
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:40,407
When you thinly slice meat like that, it's called "pian."

1034
00:40:40,407 --> 00:40:42,807
- So it's sliced meat. / - Yes.

1035
00:40:42,807 --> 00:40:44,740
- It looks delicious. / - Amazing.

1036
00:40:44,740 --> 00:40:47,040
- It's red. / - That oil was incredibly good.

1037
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:49,040
- It was so delicious. / - Fuqi feipian.

1038
00:40:50,074 --> 00:40:52,274
(Fuqi feipian)

1039
00:40:54,174 --> 00:40:56,740
(How does it taste?)

1040
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:58,440
I'm a Chinese living abroad.

1041
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:00,040
We eat this for Seollal.

1042
00:41:00,574 --> 00:41:03,440
This is one of the dishes we always eat on Seollal.

1043
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:06,674
But we don't eat it with this spicy sauce.

1044
00:41:06,674 --> 00:41:09,640
Ours is made with garlic, soy sauce and vinegar.

1045
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:11,807
But they made it spicy here in Sichuan style.

1046
00:41:11,807 --> 00:41:13,774
So you haven't tried this spicy version?

1047
00:41:13,774 --> 00:41:17,040
I have, but this is the first time

1048
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:19,140
to try the original Sichuan-style one.

1049
00:41:19,140 --> 00:41:22,174
I see why he recommended it. It's so good.

1050
00:41:22,674 --> 00:41:24,007
This sauce is...

1051
00:41:24,674 --> 00:41:26,507
Now I feel the spiciness.

1052
00:41:27,607 --> 00:41:29,240
(Coughing)

1053
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:31,240
- It hits you late. / - It's like spicy instant noodles...

1054
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:33,107
With Cheongyang chili in it.

1055
00:41:33,107 --> 00:41:35,340
But the spiciness...

1056
00:41:35,340 --> 00:41:36,774
- It's savory as well. / - It's not just spicy.

1057
00:41:36,774 --> 00:41:41,207
It has a texture of whipped cream with the first bite.

1058
00:41:41,207 --> 00:41:43,940
- It's so soft. / - The chili oil is so good.

1059
00:41:43,940 --> 00:41:45,007
This is a good restaurant.

1060
00:41:46,007 --> 00:41:49,940
The chili oil was soft and tasty like whipped cream.

1061
00:41:50,274 --> 00:41:52,540
- Chili oil was? / - Yes, chili oil was.

1062
00:41:52,540 --> 00:41:54,074
And then the spicy flavor hits you.

1063
00:41:54,074 --> 00:41:57,240
It's very well put, saying it was like whipped cream.

1064
00:41:57,240 --> 00:41:59,740
- It's has great flavor and... / - It does.

1065
00:41:59,740 --> 00:42:02,440
- It tastes so airy. / - Exactly.

1066
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:04,540
Sichuan dishes can be too much

1067
00:42:04,540 --> 00:42:05,840
because of the spices.

1068
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:08,207
But anyone can eat this dish.

1069
00:42:08,207 --> 00:42:10,640
When it's too spicy, eat this.

1070
00:42:11,407 --> 00:42:13,007
It goes so well together.

1071
00:42:13,740 --> 00:42:16,007
(What's their next dish?)

1072
00:42:19,707 --> 00:42:21,774
(It's stir-fried chicken with chili peppers and nuts)

1073
00:42:21,774 --> 00:42:25,607
They say Korean people like Sichuan dishes.

1074
00:42:26,974 --> 00:42:30,074
- This goes well with rice. / - You eat this with rice.

1075
00:42:30,074 --> 00:42:31,474
At first, she said we didn't need rice

1076
00:42:31,474 --> 00:42:32,874
because we ordered so much.

1077
00:42:32,874 --> 00:42:34,740
- Right? / - But we finished all in the end.

1078
00:42:35,574 --> 00:42:38,240
(Kung pao chicken)

1079
00:42:38,540 --> 00:42:41,007
Cheers.

1080
00:42:41,007 --> 00:42:42,940
(What does kung pao chicken taste like?)

1081
00:42:43,474 --> 00:42:45,474
- Oh, my goodness. / - It's what children would like.

1082
00:42:45,474 --> 00:42:46,307
(This is what children would like)

1083
00:42:46,307 --> 00:42:50,074
- Anyone would love this. / - Anyone would love this.

1084
00:42:50,074 --> 00:42:53,240
It's not just sweet. It's sweet and savory.

1085
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:56,540
It's a little spicy but it's tasty.

1086
00:42:56,540 --> 00:42:58,540
Yes. It's delicious.

1087
00:42:58,540 --> 00:43:01,774
How is the meat so tender?

1088
00:43:02,474 --> 00:43:06,240
The best thing about this dish is the nuts.

1089
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:07,007
(It's made with nuts)

1090
00:43:09,374 --> 00:43:11,674
I have to eat this with rice.

1091
00:43:13,074 --> 00:43:14,974
- It looks so delicious. / - You eat that with rice.

1092
00:43:14,974 --> 00:43:17,140
- It looks so good. / - It must be good with rice.

1093
00:43:17,140 --> 00:43:18,374
I'll copy you.

1094
00:43:19,140 --> 00:43:20,307
You must eat this with rice.

1095
00:43:20,307 --> 00:43:21,340
(Wow)

1096
00:43:24,574 --> 00:43:27,607
- Sichuan has so much great food. / - It was so good.

1097
00:43:27,607 --> 00:43:29,007
(What does kung pao chicken taste like with rice?)

1098
00:43:30,940 --> 00:43:32,374
(She talks with her eyes)

1099
00:43:42,574 --> 00:43:43,674
It's here.

1100
00:43:43,674 --> 00:43:44,907
The main dish is here.

1101
00:43:45,207 --> 00:43:46,074
There's more.

1102
00:43:46,074 --> 00:43:47,907
- The mapo tofu. / - The mapo tofu is here.

1103
00:43:47,907 --> 00:43:50,074
- It's mapo tofu. / - Mapo tofu.

1104
00:43:50,540 --> 00:43:53,640
(Spiciness level 2 of the Zhendehao Tour)

1105
00:43:54,207 --> 00:43:55,807
It looks different from what we've seen.

1106
00:43:55,807 --> 00:43:56,774
It looks like soft tofu stew.

1107
00:43:56,774 --> 00:43:58,907
It's nothing like the mapo tofu we have in Korea.

1108
00:43:58,907 --> 00:44:01,274
- It's totally different. / - It looks like a stew.

1109
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:03,974
The main dish is here.

1110
00:44:04,274 --> 00:44:06,007
I need some rice.

1111
00:44:06,207 --> 00:44:07,140
- You should eat it with rice. / - You need rice.

1112
00:44:07,140 --> 00:44:09,174
You definitely need rice.

1113
00:44:09,807 --> 00:44:11,707
Look at how beautiful this looks.

1114
00:44:11,707 --> 00:44:13,440
(Appreciate the beauty of mapo tofu)

1115
00:44:14,907 --> 00:44:16,274
- What should I do? / - Let me try it first.

1116
00:44:16,274 --> 00:44:17,640
Just mix it quickly.

1117
00:44:19,074 --> 00:44:20,674
(Rice covered with mapo tofu)

1118
00:44:20,674 --> 00:44:23,140
Sichuan mapo tofu has a lot of

1119
00:44:23,140 --> 00:44:24,974
chili peppers in it.

1120
00:44:25,707 --> 00:44:26,707
And minced meat.

1121
00:44:26,707 --> 00:44:29,674
- It has minced meat in it. / - This is so hard.

1122
00:44:29,674 --> 00:44:31,340
- It looks amazing. / - It tastes great with rice.

1123
00:44:31,540 --> 00:44:33,407
I'll have some Chinese food after this.

1124
00:44:36,107 --> 00:44:37,840
This is like torture.

1125
00:44:37,840 --> 00:44:39,607
I admit that the food is great there.

1126
00:44:39,607 --> 00:44:41,807
(Mapo tofu on rice is ready)

1127
00:44:43,607 --> 00:44:47,174
(What does mapo tofu taste like in Sichuan?)

1128
00:44:49,474 --> 00:44:50,674
It tastes so clean.

1129
00:44:51,240 --> 00:44:54,640
It's completely different from what we had in Korea.

1130
00:44:55,240 --> 00:44:56,874
This is nothing like that.

1131
00:44:56,874 --> 00:45:00,807
And this has different spiciness

1132
00:45:00,807 --> 00:45:02,374
from what we had in fuqi feipian.

1133
00:45:02,374 --> 00:45:04,040
This isn't smooth.

1134
00:45:04,674 --> 00:45:07,740
It comes in clean and gives you the taste of tofu,

1135
00:45:07,740 --> 00:45:09,407
then the spicy flavor hits right after.

1136
00:45:09,940 --> 00:45:11,074
It tastes very arrogant.

1137
00:45:11,974 --> 00:45:12,974
It tastes confident.

1138
00:45:12,974 --> 00:45:15,007
"I'm mapo tofu."

1139
00:45:15,140 --> 00:45:16,307
"What are you going to do about it?"

1140
00:45:16,307 --> 00:45:17,874
It tastes like that.

1141
00:45:18,107 --> 00:45:20,274
- "I am mapo tofu." / - "It's me. It's me."

1142
00:45:23,140 --> 00:45:25,040
When you go to Chengdu,

1143
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:28,107
you have to taste this mapo tofu.

1144
00:45:28,740 --> 00:45:30,107
- You're right. / - I think this is excellent.

1145
00:45:30,107 --> 00:45:31,340
- It really is. / - I...

1146
00:45:31,340 --> 00:45:32,574
It feels like...

1147
00:45:32,574 --> 00:45:34,174
I did what I was supposed to do today.

1148
00:45:34,174 --> 00:45:37,007
Right, you did a good job today.

1149
00:45:37,007 --> 00:45:38,607
Thank you for taking me to this restaurant.

1150
00:45:38,607 --> 00:45:39,874
- Really? / - And tell your husband...

1151
00:45:39,874 --> 00:45:41,207
I appreciate his advice.

1152
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:45,007
It was amazing.

1153
00:45:45,007 --> 00:45:46,407
- So, are we going to make a wish? / - Yes.

1154
00:45:46,407 --> 00:45:47,474
We have to see the statue.

1155
00:45:47,474 --> 00:45:48,640
We have to get ready early.

1156
00:45:49,840 --> 00:45:51,307
(Now it's time for the nature of Chengdu)

1157
00:45:51,307 --> 00:45:53,440
I'm overwhelmed.

1158
00:45:55,174 --> 00:45:57,074
- Even the path is pretty. / - Isn't it so pretty?

1159
00:45:58,974 --> 00:46:00,907
- The ear. / - Amazing.

1160
00:46:02,674 --> 00:46:03,707
This is huge.

1161
00:46:03,707 --> 00:46:04,674
Look at that.

1162
00:46:07,540 --> 00:46:09,607
- Bian Lian. / - Bian Lian.

1163
00:46:09,607 --> 00:46:11,107
That's right. It's Bian Lian.

1164
00:46:11,340 --> 00:46:12,774
It's convenient food.

1165
00:46:12,774 --> 00:46:16,140
(They conquer the taste of Chengdu)

1166
00:46:16,140 --> 00:46:18,340
This is the best Sichuan food.

1167
00:46:18,340 --> 00:46:19,540
This place is really popular.

1168
00:46:19,540 --> 00:46:21,074
It looks so good, right?

1169
00:46:21,240 --> 00:46:23,907
(Pleasure for your mouth, thrill for your body)

1170
00:46:23,907 --> 00:46:25,440
My ears are hot.

1171
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:31,940
Wow. Let's go.

1172
00:46:31,940 --> 00:46:37,774
(Day 3 of the Zhendehao Tour)

1173
00:46:40,507 --> 00:46:43,440
This is second day of Zhendehao Tour.

1174
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:45,607
Today, we're going to...

1175
00:46:45,607 --> 00:46:47,674
The Leshan Giant Buddha. I talked about it yesterday.

1176
00:46:47,674 --> 00:46:50,774
- There's a statue of the Buddha. / - Our first stop.

1177
00:46:50,774 --> 00:46:52,640
You might have seen it on TV before.

1178
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:55,074
There's a huge statue of the Buddha.

1179
00:46:55,640 --> 00:46:57,074
It's called the Leshan Giant Buddha.

1180
00:46:57,074 --> 00:46:58,174
It was famous before

1181
00:46:58,174 --> 00:47:00,374
but it became even more famous

1182
00:47:00,374 --> 00:47:02,807
because Xi Jinping became the president...

1183
00:47:02,807 --> 00:47:04,140
After making a wish there.

1184
00:47:04,140 --> 00:47:05,274
Making it even more famous.

1185
00:47:05,274 --> 00:47:06,874
It's become even more famous.

1186
00:47:06,874 --> 00:47:09,474
And there's an interesting thing about this place.

1187
00:47:09,907 --> 00:47:13,040
Let's say we made our wish there.

1188
00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:17,007
If our wish is realized,

1189
00:47:17,007 --> 00:47:18,640
we have to visit the place again.

1190
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:20,707
- Why? / - We have to go back there...

1191
00:47:20,707 --> 00:47:23,074
To say thank you.

1192
00:47:23,474 --> 00:47:26,540
- To thank the Buddha? / - So if we go there now...

1193
00:47:26,540 --> 00:47:27,674
We can visit the place again later.

1194
00:47:27,674 --> 00:47:29,807
I hope Raeyeon will get married next year.

1195
00:47:30,074 --> 00:47:31,674
I'll make a wish like this.

1196
00:47:31,674 --> 00:47:33,240
- Will your voice get heard? / - If you get married...

1197
00:47:33,807 --> 00:47:35,374
Don't whisper and just say it.

1198
00:47:36,840 --> 00:47:44,574
(This is the biggest stone-carved Buddha statue)

1199
00:47:44,907 --> 00:47:46,574
I'm so hungry now.

1200
00:47:46,574 --> 00:47:48,007
We should eat something first.

1201
00:47:48,007 --> 00:47:50,274
You're in charge of that.

1202
00:47:50,274 --> 00:47:52,674
Right, so I prepared something simple.

1203
00:47:52,974 --> 00:47:54,440
- I'm sure you'll like it. / - Is there a good restaurant?

1204
00:47:54,440 --> 00:47:56,340
- Can we have breakfast first? / - Of course.

1205
00:47:56,340 --> 00:47:58,140
- Let's eat first. / - Let's do that.

1206
00:47:58,140 --> 00:47:59,474
- Quickly. / - Let's go.

1207
00:47:59,474 --> 00:48:01,340
(First, they go to eat breakfast)

1208
00:48:03,207 --> 00:48:04,607
What are they having for breakfast?

1209
00:48:04,607 --> 00:48:06,307
What are they eating for breakfast in Sichuan?

1210
00:48:06,407 --> 00:48:09,940
We're having jianbing for breakfast.

1211
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:12,407
It's a kind of crepe

1212
00:48:12,407 --> 00:48:16,040
that you can try anywhere in the streets of China.

1213
00:48:16,274 --> 00:48:18,540
(Excited)

1214
00:48:19,607 --> 00:48:22,040
(On thinly spread wheat-flour batter)

1215
00:48:22,040 --> 00:48:24,007
- Is that it? / - I've seen it before.

1216
00:48:24,007 --> 00:48:25,607
- Is this jianbing? / - Yes. It's jianbing.

1217
00:48:25,607 --> 00:48:28,140

And it's good for breakfast.

1222
00:48:36,207 --> 00:48:38,007
- My gosh, there's a lot. / - It looks great.

1223
00:48:38,007 --> 00:48:40,374
I love watching videos on this.

- Really? / - The video of making jianbing.

1225
00:48:41,940 --> 00:48:44,007
It's very popular.

1226
00:48:44,340 --> 00:48:47,874
Let's order one that has chicken and pork in it.

1227
00:48:47,974 --> 00:48:50,140
And should we get one with beef in it?

1228
00:48:50,140 --> 00:48:51,674
I'll have one with a lot of meat in it.

1229
00:48:51,674 --> 00:48:53,740
- This one has the most meat. / - Really?

1230
00:48:53,740 --> 00:48:55,807
People in their 30s love meat.

1231
00:48:56,607 --> 00:48:59,740
- That's right. / - People in their late 30s love it.

1232
00:49:00,907 --> 00:49:04,274
(Place an egg on top of the batter)

1233
00:49:04,907 --> 00:49:07,707
(Beat egg gently)

1234
00:49:07,707 --> 00:49:09,274
It's like toast in the morning.

1235
00:49:09,307 --> 00:49:11,507
- It looks good. / - Turn it over.

1236
00:49:11,507 --> 00:49:13,374
- They're turning it over. / - Is that black sesame?

1237
00:49:13,374 --> 00:49:14,507
Yes, sesame seeds.

1238
00:49:14,774 --> 00:49:17,207
- Black sesame? / - You can add anything you want.

1239
00:49:17,607 --> 00:49:19,307
(Raeyeon's choice is beef jianbing)

1240
00:49:19,307 --> 00:49:21,474
- You can choose the topping. / - I see.

1241
00:49:21,474 --> 00:49:23,374
You can add beef, pork, and chicken

1242
00:49:23,374 --> 00:49:24,574
in one if you want.

1243
00:49:24,574 --> 00:49:26,307
It's like a Chinese burrito.

1244
00:49:26,307 --> 00:49:28,074
- That's right. / - It's like crepe.

1245
00:49:28,074 --> 00:49:29,540

(Family set jianbing, $3.30)

1247
00:49:30,974 --> 00:49:32,274
It looks delicious.

1248

(Beef Jianbing, $2)

1249
00:49:36,307 --> 00:49:37,407
This is our first meal of the day.

1250
00:49:37,474 --> 00:49:39,340
It's jianbing.

1251
00:49:39,340 --> 00:49:40,707
Jianbing.

1252
00:49:40,707 --> 00:49:42,074
(Their first meal of the day)

1253
00:49:42,074 --> 00:49:44,107
I really wanted to eat this.

1254
00:49:45,340 --> 00:49:48,374
(Cutting the jianbing in half)

1255
00:49:48,807 --> 00:49:50,640
What is that? Is it fried shrimp?

1256
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:52,074
They added something like nacho chips.

1257
00:49:52,074 --> 00:49:54,074
- To make it crisp. / - Right.

1258
00:49:54,074 --> 00:49:56,174
- It was good. / - I loved the texture of it.

1259
00:49:56,174 --> 00:49:59,340
The meat was tender and the chips were crispy.

1260
00:49:59,340 --> 00:50:02,040
- Great combination. / - I saw them sprinkle something.

1261
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:03,340
This is so good.

1262
00:50:06,607 --> 00:50:09,174
It has egg, meat

1263
00:50:09,174 --> 00:50:11,040
and vegetables in it.

1264
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:14,374
- Yes. / - Nutritionally, it's a perfect breakfast.

1265
00:50:14,774 --> 00:50:17,774
- It's the best. / - It's like a hamburger...

1266
00:50:17,774 --> 00:50:20,207
For breakfast. It's simple but filling.

1267
00:50:20,207 --> 00:50:22,807
- But this is much healthier. / - Right.

1268
00:50:23,307 --> 00:50:24,374
Exactly.

1269
00:50:24,974 --> 00:50:26,040
It looks delicious.

1270
00:50:29,507 --> 00:50:31,607
What is this crispy powder?

1271
00:50:32,007 --> 00:50:33,174
- This powder? / - Yes.

1272
00:50:33,507 --> 00:50:36,640
They make it with pork or beef.

1273
00:50:37,174 --> 00:50:40,540
- Okay. / - They make the powdered meat...

1274
00:50:40,540 --> 00:50:42,807
And add it on rice or porridge.

1275
00:50:42,807 --> 00:50:45,940
So they added it like seasoning in here as well.

1276
00:50:46,407 --> 00:50:47,840
It's sweet.

1277
00:50:48,940 --> 00:50:50,240
- Do you like it? / - Yes.

1278
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:52,207
The powder tastes so good.

1279
00:50:52,207 --> 00:50:55,507
One jianbing is big enough for a woman.

1280
00:50:55,507 --> 00:50:57,140
Right. We could've shared one together.

1281
00:50:57,140 --> 00:51:00,207
We are actresses, so it was way too much for us.

1282
00:51:01,340 --> 00:51:04,674
(It's a delicious and hearty breakfast)

1283
00:51:04,674 --> 00:51:07,807
After we finish this, we will take a train.

1284
00:51:07,807 --> 00:51:08,807
Really?

1285
00:51:08,807 --> 00:51:09,974
We have to take the train.

1286
00:51:09,974 --> 00:51:11,507
Let's eat quickly so we can make it on time.

1287
00:51:13,374 --> 00:51:15,607
- You can also take out the food. / - Right.

1288
00:51:15,607 --> 00:51:16,940
Yes, takeout.

1289
00:51:16,940 --> 00:51:20,174
We had it at a mall near the train station.

1290
00:51:21,207 --> 00:51:24,840
You can buy it before getting on the train.

1291
00:51:24,840 --> 00:51:26,874
(It's so delicious that they can't even leave)

1292
00:51:27,307 --> 00:51:28,640
(Sights, Food)

1293
00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:29,974
(Sights)

1294
00:51:29,974 --> 00:51:32,840
(The Leshan Giant Buddha)

1295
00:51:32,840 --> 00:51:35,774
We have to see some attractions now.

1296
00:51:36,007 --> 00:51:37,874
- You just keep eating. / - Right?

1297
00:51:40,140 --> 00:51:44,274
(They arrive at the train station to see the Buddha)

1298
00:51:44,274 --> 00:51:46,840
So, we're going to the Leshan Giant Buddha now.

1299
00:51:46,840 --> 00:51:48,140
And we have to take a train.

1300
00:51:48,140 --> 00:51:50,407
It takes about 2 hours. That's why...

1301
00:51:50,407 --> 00:51:52,840
- We hurried out early. / - Do they sell food there?

1302
00:51:53,507 --> 00:51:55,574
We just had jianbing for breakfast.

1303
00:51:55,574 --> 00:51:57,107
And you want food again?

1304
00:51:57,107 --> 00:51:58,474
I just want some snacks.

1305
00:51:58,907 --> 00:52:01,140
Since we're in Chengdu,

1306
00:52:01,140 --> 00:52:04,474
it'll be fun to take a train to go to the suburbs.

1307
00:52:05,140 --> 00:52:09,540
(1.5 hours from Chengdu station to Leshan)

1308
00:52:10,140 --> 00:52:14,607
(30 minutes by car to the Buddha)

1309
00:52:15,474 --> 00:52:19,774
(Leshan is located in south-central part of Sichuan)

1310
00:52:21,074 --> 00:52:22,640
After 2 hours,

1311
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:23,874
we've finally arrived

1312
00:52:23,874 --> 00:52:25,640
at the Leshan Giant Buddha!

1313
00:52:25,640 --> 00:52:27,074
I'm so excited.

1314
00:52:27,707 --> 00:52:29,740
I've got a treat prepared for you.

1315
00:52:29,740 --> 00:52:32,307
- Really? Why? / - We're going on a cruise ship.

1316
00:52:32,707 --> 00:52:33,974
On the cruise,

1317
00:52:33,974 --> 00:52:36,040
you can see the entire statue.

1318
00:52:36,274 --> 00:52:37,507
From the boat.

1319
00:52:37,507 --> 00:52:41,140
It's a stone-carved statue of the Buddha on a cliff.

1320
00:52:41,140 --> 00:52:44,074
It's the biggest statue of the Buddha in the world.

1321
00:52:44,840 --> 00:52:46,674
Go, go, go.

1322
00:52:47,407 --> 00:52:48,607
In the Tang Dynasty,

1323
00:52:48,607 --> 00:52:50,040
they had a lot of accidents there.

1324
00:52:50,040 --> 00:52:53,574
- Like ship accidents or floods. / - Ship accidents.

1325
00:52:54,040 --> 00:52:56,674
So they carved the statue of the Buddha

1326
00:52:56,674 --> 00:52:58,207
wishing there would be no more accidents.

1327
00:52:59,374 --> 00:53:00,840
- Like a guardian? / - Yes.

1328
00:53:01,107 --> 00:53:02,874
But it took 90 years to make it.

1329
00:53:04,240 --> 00:53:05,407
They made it for 90 years?

1330
00:53:05,407 --> 00:53:07,240
So the workers died before the statue was completed.

1331
00:53:07,240 --> 00:53:08,407
True, true.

1332
00:53:09,607 --> 00:53:12,607
(Leshan Giant Buddha Cruise)

1333
00:53:12,607 --> 00:53:15,407
(30-minute course, $23.40)

1334
00:53:15,407 --> 00:53:20,107
(They run cruise ships during summer and winter)

1335
00:53:20,107 --> 00:53:22,740
The Leshan Giant Buddha will be on your left.

1336
00:53:22,740 --> 00:53:23,740
- Left? / - Yes. Over there.

1337
00:53:23,740 --> 00:53:26,307
You'll see it once we go around the corner.

1338
00:53:27,074 --> 00:53:28,374
- Look at those people. / - I'm excited.

1339
00:53:28,374 --> 00:53:30,340
- What's it like? / - We'll see it just after a turn.

1340
00:53:30,340 --> 00:53:32,474
We're at the best spot to see it.

1341
00:53:33,007 --> 00:53:34,007
I knew it.

1342
00:53:34,740 --> 00:53:40,607
(After 10 minutes, they are in front of the statue)

1343
00:53:41,474 --> 00:53:42,374
It's right here.

1344
00:53:42,374 --> 00:53:44,540
I can see it. I just saw its foot.

1345
00:53:44,540 --> 00:53:47,340
(The Leshan Giant Buddha shows up)

1346
00:53:47,340 --> 00:53:48,440
This must be it. I think we're here.

1347
00:53:48,440 --> 00:53:49,840
- My gosh. / - Gosh, this is it.

1348
00:53:51,474 --> 00:53:53,074
It's enormous.

1349
00:53:53,440 --> 00:53:55,040
- It was really big. / - It's huge.

1350
00:53:55,040 --> 00:53:58,240
- It's as big as a mountain. / - It's the mountain itself.

1351
00:53:58,240 --> 00:54:00,540
- They carved that out? / - My goodness.

1352
00:54:00,540 --> 00:54:03,607
- It took about 100 years. / - It's like a mountain.

1353
00:54:03,607 --> 00:54:05,240
On a single toe,

1354
00:54:05,240 --> 00:54:07,274
you can sit five adults.

1355
00:54:07,274 --> 00:54:08,574
- On one toe. / - Yes.

1356
00:54:08,707 --> 00:54:10,574
- Gosh, it's so big. / - It's really big.

1357
00:54:10,574 --> 00:54:12,440
It's as tall as a...

1358
00:54:12,440 --> 00:54:14,507
- 25-story building. / - Even the size screams "China."

1359
00:54:15,107 --> 00:54:19,074
(It took over 90 years to complete)

1360
00:54:19,074 --> 00:54:23,340
(It remembers 1,000 years of history)

1361
00:54:24,207 --> 00:54:27,874
(It's the biggest stone Buddha in the world)

1362
00:54:28,274 --> 00:54:29,874
I'm overwhelmed.

1363
00:54:30,340 --> 00:54:32,040
I feel overwhelmed.

1364
00:54:32,574 --> 00:54:34,707
- No wonder she feels overwhelmed. / - It's very big.

1365
00:54:34,707 --> 00:54:37,507
(There's a saying that compares it to a mountain)

1366
00:54:42,007 --> 00:54:44,207
"This mountain itself is the Buddha..."

1367
00:54:44,707 --> 00:54:46,174
"And the Buddha itself is the mountain."

1368
00:54:46,174 --> 00:54:48,074
- I see. / - This is amazing.

1369
00:54:48,074 --> 00:54:49,507
It's magnificent.

1370
00:54:49,907 --> 00:54:51,240
It's awesome.

1371
00:54:54,774 --> 00:54:57,107
We came all the way here. I'd like to see more.

1372
00:54:57,107 --> 00:54:59,174
- That's why... / - Do you know what I mean?

1373
00:54:59,174 --> 00:55:01,407
- That's why... / - Yes.

1374
00:55:01,407 --> 00:55:03,140
I'm taking you here.

1375
00:55:03,140 --> 00:55:05,774
After a 15-minute walk,

1376
00:55:05,774 --> 00:55:07,740
we'll reach the ear of the Buddha.

1377
00:55:07,740 --> 00:55:10,207
But I heard it takes 3 to 4 hours.

1378
00:55:10,207 --> 00:55:12,374
The route going all the way down to the feet takes

1379
00:55:12,374 --> 00:55:13,540
3 hours.

1380
00:55:13,540 --> 00:55:16,774
It takes only 15 minutes to get to the ear.

1381
00:55:18,640 --> 00:55:19,940
(After 380m of hiking, they can see the Buddha)

1382
00:55:19,940 --> 00:55:21,174
The Leshan Giant Buddha.

1383
00:55:22,540 --> 00:55:24,540
This is the way to the Leshan Giant Buddha.

1384
00:55:25,174 --> 00:55:26,307
I'm nervous.

1385
00:55:26,840 --> 00:55:28,274
(Gulping)

1386
00:55:30,107 --> 00:55:31,607
Are they all stairs?

1387
00:55:32,274 --> 00:55:33,940
- It only takes 15 minutes. / - Right.

1388
00:55:33,940 --> 00:55:36,207
- It was the perfect course. / - They're all stairs.

1389
00:55:36,207 --> 00:55:38,507
You ate so much. You need to work out a bit.

1390
00:55:38,807 --> 00:55:41,107
- Luckily, it's not that steep. / - No, it's not.

1391
00:55:42,307 --> 00:55:43,374
It's hot.

1392
00:55:43,774 --> 00:55:45,607
I'm sweating so much.

1393
00:55:45,607 --> 00:55:47,274
(It's hotter than they thought... They're sweating a lot)

1394
00:55:47,507 --> 00:55:48,507
(Spaced out)

1395
00:55:48,507 --> 00:55:49,874
She suddenly became quiet.

1396
00:55:50,607 --> 00:55:52,174
That's not it.

1397
00:55:52,174 --> 00:55:54,807
I was making a wish while climbing the stairs.

1398
00:55:54,807 --> 00:55:56,440
The more I get to know you, the funnier you get.

1399
00:55:56,440 --> 00:55:58,174
- She's so extreme. / - Yes.

1400
00:55:58,174 --> 00:56:00,207
- She's either silent or talkative. / - Right.

1401
00:56:02,774 --> 00:56:08,074
(The stairs look endless)

1402
00:56:09,674 --> 00:56:11,940
- I see the ear! / - Ear, ear.

1403
00:56:15,107 --> 00:56:16,407
- It's the ear. / - You can see it.

1404
00:56:16,407 --> 00:56:18,440
I can see the head and eyebrows.

1405
00:56:18,440 --> 00:56:19,507
(It looks enormous even from a distance)

1406
00:56:24,274 --> 00:56:25,507
This is amazing.

1407
00:56:26,274 --> 00:56:27,407
This is amazing.

1408
00:56:29,107 --> 00:56:30,707
- This is amazing. / - The camera...

1409
00:56:30,707 --> 00:56:31,974
Can't capture its greatness.

1410
00:56:31,974 --> 00:56:35,040
You should be there to feel its magnificence.

1411
00:56:35,040 --> 00:56:36,640
(The Buddha looks even more magnificent up close)

1412
00:56:36,640 --> 00:56:39,074
Seeing the whole figure from a distance was great,

1413
00:56:39,074 --> 00:56:40,940
but seeing it from up close is also amazing.

1414
00:56:42,074 --> 00:56:43,207
This is amazing.

1415
00:56:43,574 --> 00:56:45,974
When I saw it from a distance earlier,

1416
00:56:45,974 --> 00:56:48,274
it was surreal as if I was watching television.

1417
00:56:48,274 --> 00:56:50,540
Seeing it from up close, it's even more surreal.

1418
00:56:51,240 --> 00:56:52,707
- Don't you think so? / - I agree.

1419
00:56:52,707 --> 00:56:53,840
(It's unbelievably huge)

1420
00:56:53,840 --> 00:56:55,074
I'd like to remove those weeds.

1421
00:56:57,440 --> 00:56:58,707
- It's so big. / - Right.

1422
00:57:02,540 --> 00:57:04,007
- It's so different. / - Look over there.

1423
00:57:04,007 --> 00:57:05,274
They're queuing.

1424
00:57:05,274 --> 00:57:06,407
(This is just as incredible as the size of statue)

1425
00:57:06,407 --> 00:57:10,740
They're queuing there to walk down safely.

1426
00:57:10,740 --> 00:57:12,340
There are too many people.

1427
00:57:12,907 --> 00:57:14,207
- To walk down to the feet? / - Yes.

1428
00:57:14,207 --> 00:57:15,507
It's a queue to walk down.

1429
00:57:15,507 --> 00:57:17,674
(It's a walking route that takes 3 to 4 hours)

1430
00:57:17,674 --> 00:57:20,640
- It'll take a whole day to see it. / - Yes.

1431
00:57:21,140 --> 00:57:22,507
Many people walk down the stairs...

1432
00:57:22,507 --> 00:57:24,274
- To receive good energy. / - To make a wish.

1433
00:57:24,274 --> 00:57:25,840
There are a lot of people doing that.

1434
00:57:25,840 --> 00:57:29,007
(The path makes their wishes come true)

1435
00:57:32,874 --> 00:57:33,974
(They make wishes as well)

1436
00:57:33,974 --> 00:57:35,274
They're making a wish.

1437
00:57:41,240 --> 00:57:42,274
Alright.

1438
00:57:42,974 --> 00:57:44,274
- It's time to rate. / - Yes.

1439
00:57:44,274 --> 00:57:47,307
The Leshan Giant Buddha of the Zhendehao Tour.

1440
00:57:47,574 --> 00:57:49,740
Let's rate it.

1441
00:57:49,840 --> 00:57:51,040
Alright.

1442
00:57:51,774 --> 00:57:53,607
1, 2, 3.

1443
00:57:53,874 --> 00:57:55,974
Really good!

1444
00:57:56,607 --> 00:57:59,074
- It's a must-see. / - It is.

1445
00:57:59,074 --> 00:58:01,707
I liked seeing it from a distance but seeing it up close,

1446
00:58:01,707 --> 00:58:03,340
you get a greater sense of feeling.

1447
00:58:03,340 --> 00:58:04,574
It has a mysterious energy.

1448
00:58:04,574 --> 00:58:06,474
Yes, we got positive energy.

1449
00:58:06,474 --> 00:58:08,207
I'm glad I came up here.

1450
00:58:08,207 --> 00:58:11,874
If you have time, it's not bad to walk down for 3 hours

1451
00:58:11,874 --> 00:58:13,074
but even if you don't have time...

1452
00:58:13,074 --> 00:58:14,674
- It only took us 15 minutes. / - Right.

1453
00:58:14,674 --> 00:58:16,074
It didn't take so long for us to climb up here.

1454
00:58:16,074 --> 00:58:17,540
I hope you don't miss this.

1455
00:58:18,107 --> 00:58:20,274
(The Leshan Giant Buddha is the biggest stone Buddha)

1456
00:58:20,274 --> 00:58:21,440
We're not getting the full effect because

1457
00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:22,007
it's not in person.

1458
00:58:22,007 --> 00:58:25,340
Look at the size of the people compared to it.

1459
00:58:25,740 --> 00:58:26,774
It's huge.

1460
00:58:27,274 --> 00:58:32,640
(2 hours by car to Chengdu)

1461
00:58:34,840 --> 00:58:38,640
- Are we now in Kuan Zhai Xiang Zi? / - Yes, we are.

1462
00:58:39,040 --> 00:58:41,240
There are a lot of great restaurants here.

1463
00:58:41,240 --> 00:58:43,107
As you know, today is our last day.

1464
00:58:43,107 --> 00:58:46,974
We're going to a very special place

1465
00:58:46,974 --> 00:58:48,107
for our last dinner.

1466
00:58:48,907 --> 00:58:50,340
(Sights, Food)

1467
00:58:50,340 --> 00:58:52,007
(Food)

1468
00:58:52,007 --> 00:58:54,740
(Hot pot)

1469
00:58:55,040 --> 00:58:58,840
(There's a typical Sichuan dish)

1470
00:58:58,840 --> 00:59:02,907
(It's loved by young and old, male and female)

1471
00:59:03,740 --> 00:59:06,307
(It's one of the spiciest dishes, hot pot)

1472
00:59:06,307 --> 00:59:08,507
I love Chinese hot pot.

1473
00:59:09,474 --> 00:59:10,974
Fresh lamb is delicious.

1474
00:59:11,507 --> 00:59:12,740
Lamb is amazing.

1475
00:59:12,740 --> 00:59:15,040
- It was incredible. / - Fish is also delicious.

1476
00:59:15,240 --> 00:59:18,007
Fish fillet in hot pot is the best.

1477
00:59:19,507 --> 00:59:23,374
(Raeyeon orders a lot of food)

1478
00:59:23,574 --> 00:59:26,007
How would you like your broth?

1479
00:59:26,307 --> 00:59:27,974
There are different levels of spiciness.

1480
00:59:27,974 --> 00:59:30,140
Would you like it mild, medium or extreme?

1481
00:59:31,240 --> 00:59:32,374
- Medium? / - Medium.

1482
00:59:32,374 --> 00:59:34,674
Medium or a little bit spicy?

1483
00:59:34,674 --> 00:59:36,374
Medium? Do you think medium will be alright?

1484
00:59:36,374 --> 00:59:39,040
(They order medium spicy broth)

1485
00:59:40,007 --> 00:59:40,840
Medium spicy.

1486
00:59:40,840 --> 00:59:42,707
(I hope it's not too spicy)

1487
00:59:44,074 --> 00:59:45,907
It looks like there's a performance down there.

1488
00:59:45,907 --> 00:59:47,840
There's a dancing dragon.

1489
00:59:47,840 --> 00:59:49,174
Shall we go have a look?

1490
00:59:49,174 --> 00:59:51,207
(They decided to watch a show before the meal)

1491
00:59:51,207 --> 00:59:52,874
This is so nice.

1492
00:59:54,607 --> 00:59:56,907
- Yujin seems truly happy. / - She's so excited.

1493
00:59:56,907 --> 00:59:57,940
She's so excited.

1494
00:59:57,940 --> 01:00:00,807
(You can watch traditional Chinese performances)

1495
01:00:00,807 --> 01:00:02,307
That's pouring tea.

1496
01:00:04,840 --> 01:00:10,374
(Here, you can have a meal and watch a show)

1497
01:00:12,907 --> 01:00:14,740
It seems like the Bian Lian is starting soon. Let's go.

1498
01:00:14,740 --> 01:00:15,974
Let's go down and watch it.

1499
01:00:15,974 --> 01:00:17,474
- We need to watch it nearby. / - What is Bian Lian?

1500
01:00:17,474 --> 01:00:19,074
The show where they quickly change face masks.

1501
01:00:20,107 --> 01:00:21,374
It's a mask changing show.

1502
01:00:21,707 --> 01:00:23,407
- Bian Lian is really interesting. / - It's fascinating.

1503
01:00:25,774 --> 01:00:26,774
It's really interesting.

1504
01:00:35,074 --> 01:00:36,407
It's fascinating.

1505
01:00:36,407 --> 01:00:37,440
(He changes masks in an instant)

1506
01:00:37,440 --> 01:00:41,974
Bian Lian originated from the Sichuan region.

1507
01:00:42,540 --> 01:00:43,740
(It's a mask of a cartoon character)

1508
01:00:43,740 --> 01:00:46,940
There are a lot of places where they have Bian Lian.

1509
01:00:46,940 --> 01:00:48,574
(It's so cute)

1510
01:00:49,207 --> 01:00:51,274
(It's the highlight of the show)

1511
01:00:51,274 --> 01:00:53,940
(He interacts with the audience)

1512
01:00:56,474 --> 01:00:57,574
He pretended to kiss my hand,

1513
01:00:57,574 --> 01:00:59,340
then his mask changed.

1514
01:00:59,340 --> 01:01:01,140
- In front of your eyes? / - Yes.

1515
01:01:02,540 --> 01:01:03,640
It's like magic.

1516
01:01:03,640 --> 01:01:05,140
(Startled)

1517
01:01:05,707 --> 01:01:07,307
Yujin easily gets scared.

1518
01:01:07,307 --> 01:01:08,640
I get scared very easily.

1519
01:01:15,774 --> 01:01:18,340
(It was a success)

1520
01:01:19,574 --> 01:01:21,807
(The highlight of Bian Lian)

1521
01:01:21,807 --> 01:01:25,440
(It's a fire show)

1522
01:01:29,807 --> 01:01:31,407
You can watch this show for free, right?

1523
01:01:31,407 --> 01:01:34,740
Yes, but you have to be there on time.

1524
01:01:36,240 --> 01:01:39,140
(It's time to treat their mouths now)

1525
01:01:39,640 --> 01:01:43,407
(Red soup and white soup, $11.40)

1526
01:01:43,407 --> 01:01:44,874
Let me make the sauce.

1527
01:01:44,974 --> 01:01:47,574
The sauce is the most important for hot pot.

1528
01:01:48,174 --> 01:01:50,140
We're in Sichuan,

1529
01:01:50,140 --> 01:01:51,540
which is a place known for spicy food.

1530
01:01:51,540 --> 01:01:54,040
- Peanut sauce... / - They don't have peanut sauce.

1531
01:01:54,040 --> 01:01:55,774
- No, they don't. / - I'm so sad.

1532
01:01:55,774 --> 01:01:57,807
I don't know what I should do now.

1533
01:01:58,207 --> 01:02:00,207
- But I will... / - I eat a lot of peanut sauce.

1534
01:02:00,207 --> 01:02:02,440
Don't worry.

1535
01:02:02,640 --> 01:02:04,007
I can make a great sauce.

1536
01:02:04,007 --> 01:02:08,274
This is sesame and corn oil.

1537
01:02:08,274 --> 01:02:10,640
Let me add the sesame and corn oil.

1538
01:02:10,640 --> 01:02:11,974
There must be a perfect recipe for it.

1539
01:02:12,207 --> 01:02:13,407
You can pour everything in if you want.

1540
01:02:13,707 --> 01:02:17,107
I prefer to add a lot of garlic in it.

1541
01:02:18,507 --> 01:02:21,007
- I love garlic and spring onions. / - You need cilantro.

1542
01:02:22,174 --> 01:02:24,140
I'll add a spoonful of oyster sauce.

1543
01:02:25,307 --> 01:02:26,274
People have different tastes.

1544
01:02:26,274 --> 01:02:28,340
- But most people like it this way. / - What is it?

1545
01:02:28,540 --> 01:02:31,074
- It's black vinegar made of rice. / - I like vinegar.

1546
01:02:32,174 --> 01:02:34,574
Vinegar in the sauce makes it easier

1547
01:02:34,574 --> 01:02:36,607
for Koreans to eat the dish.

1548
01:02:36,607 --> 01:02:39,407
- I should learn this recipe. / - This is a Taiwanese way.

1549
01:02:40,407 --> 01:02:44,107
(The hot pot is starting to boil)

1550
01:02:44,740 --> 01:02:46,007
I can smell it.

1551
01:02:46,007 --> 01:02:47,007
(White soup, red soup)

1552
01:02:47,074 --> 01:02:51,107
Let me start with the hard ingredients for the broth.

1553
01:02:51,107 --> 01:02:52,340
It's for the broth.

1554
01:02:53,340 --> 01:02:54,840
Let me put radish in.

1555
01:02:56,074 --> 01:02:57,874
Can I try the soup?

1556
01:02:58,474 --> 01:03:00,240
- Try the soup. / - Okay.

1557
01:03:00,240 --> 01:03:02,474
When we eat shabu-shabu in Korea,

1558
01:03:02,474 --> 01:03:05,240
we cook porridge with the soup.

1559
01:03:05,240 --> 01:03:08,107
But Chinese hot pot is made of oil.

1560
01:03:08,107 --> 01:03:10,207
So you can't drink this soup.

1561
01:03:10,207 --> 01:03:12,007
It's only to blanch the ingredients.

1562
01:03:13,807 --> 01:03:15,707
It coats the ingredients and adds a spicy flavor to it.

1563
01:03:16,407 --> 01:03:18,707
After some time, the oil is all gone.

1564
01:03:19,007 --> 01:03:21,874
- Try it. You'll be surprised. / - Okay, I'll try like this.

1565
01:03:21,874 --> 01:03:25,807
(Yujin tastes the soup with her chopstick)

1566
01:03:26,007 --> 01:03:27,174
How is it?

1567
01:03:27,707 --> 01:03:28,540
Oh, my.

1568
01:03:28,540 --> 01:03:29,774
Is this the medium level of spiciness?

1569
01:03:29,807 --> 01:03:31,607
This is medium.

1570
01:03:31,607 --> 01:03:33,907
This is only medium spiciness.

1571
01:03:34,607 --> 01:03:35,607
Why don't you try it?

1572
01:03:37,907 --> 01:03:39,874
- I'm okay. / - Really?

1573
01:03:39,874 --> 01:03:41,140
What?

1574
01:03:41,140 --> 01:03:42,607
It really was okay with me.

1575
01:03:42,607 --> 01:03:43,807
Didn't you suppress it?

1576
01:03:43,807 --> 01:03:45,907
Strangely, I can't eat Cheongyang chili...

1577
01:03:45,907 --> 01:03:48,574
- Or spicy rice cake. / - It's so strange.

1578
01:03:48,574 --> 01:03:50,074
But this was okay for me.

1579
01:03:50,674 --> 01:03:52,174
The spiciness is different.

1580
01:03:52,174 --> 01:03:53,474
It's completely different.

1581
01:03:54,874 --> 01:03:56,174
- I'm scared. / - Isn't that right?

1582
01:03:56,474 --> 01:03:58,274
You must be strong when it comes to hot pot.

1583
01:03:58,274 --> 01:04:02,307
I came to Sichuan to eat this.

1584
01:04:02,874 --> 01:04:05,407
(Worried)

1585
01:04:05,474 --> 01:04:07,174
Cheers. Our last drink.

1586
01:04:10,040 --> 01:04:12,740
(It's time for them to eat properly)

1587
01:04:12,740 --> 01:04:14,374
Let's enjoy the food.

1588
01:04:14,374 --> 01:04:15,740
Pick an ingredient you want.

1589
01:04:16,740 --> 01:04:19,407
And sway it in the soup.

1590
01:04:19,874 --> 01:04:21,274
- What is that? / - It's lamb meat.

1591
01:04:21,274 --> 01:04:24,140
- Lamb meat? / - It looks so delicious.

1592
01:04:25,607 --> 01:04:27,507
- I'm really hungry. / - Yes.

1593
01:04:27,507 --> 01:04:28,940
I'm going to eat this in a wrap.

1594
01:04:29,407 --> 01:04:32,540
In case I get surprised by the mala sauce,

1595
01:04:32,540 --> 01:04:35,074
I'm going to try the ones in white soup first.

1596
01:04:35,340 --> 01:04:38,607
Me too. I will also try the white soup first.

1597
01:04:38,707 --> 01:04:40,440
- Dip it in the sauce. / - Wrap it.

1598
01:04:40,440 --> 01:04:42,707
I make a thick sauce.

1599
01:04:42,707 --> 01:04:44,374
- I don't dip it, I wrap it. / - That looks so good.

1600
01:04:44,374 --> 01:04:47,040
I wonder what the sauce is like.

1601
01:04:48,440 --> 01:04:49,440
It's good.

1602
01:04:49,440 --> 01:04:51,140
(The white soup is also okay for Yujin)

1603
01:04:51,207 --> 01:04:52,707
Is that all oil?

1604
01:04:52,707 --> 01:04:54,440
No, white soup is just meat broth.

1605
01:04:54,774 --> 01:04:57,907
It's meat broth, so you can eat it easily.

1606
01:04:57,907 --> 01:04:59,007
It's really delicious.

1607
01:04:59,407 --> 01:05:01,940
It's time to try the mala hot pot for me.

1608
01:05:02,407 --> 01:05:04,140
- Raeyeon. / - It's dripping.

1609
01:05:04,140 --> 01:05:06,074
- It's dripping. / - Look at the oil.

1610
01:05:06,074 --> 01:05:06,907
It's coated with oil.

1611
01:05:06,907 --> 01:05:09,540
- It got coated on the way up. / - That's right.

1612
01:05:09,540 --> 01:05:11,074
She'll eat it after she dips it in the sauce.

1613
01:05:11,240 --> 01:05:14,907
(She also takes a big mouthful this time)

1614
01:05:15,807 --> 01:05:18,940
(I bet that's really spicy)

1615
01:05:20,074 --> 01:05:21,440
That looks so good.

1616
01:05:22,107 --> 01:05:23,340
It's art.

1617
01:05:23,674 --> 01:05:25,040
With beer.

1618
01:05:27,440 --> 01:05:28,440
It's okay. It's really okay.

1619
01:05:28,440 --> 01:05:30,040
- Really? I want to try it too. / - Yes.

1620
01:05:30,707 --> 01:05:32,974
I'll try now.

1621
01:05:39,240 --> 01:05:43,140
I'll try the meat first. The meat is here.

1622
01:05:43,907 --> 01:05:47,207
(Yujin tries the red soup)

1623
01:05:48,340 --> 01:05:49,807
- It's hitting her. / - She can taste it.

1624
01:05:49,807 --> 01:05:51,040
Did something happen to you?

1625
01:05:51,440 --> 01:05:53,007
It's no joke.

1626
01:05:54,207 --> 01:05:55,540
You seem really okay

1627
01:05:55,540 --> 01:05:57,274
when it was so spicy for me.

1628
01:05:57,274 --> 01:05:59,574
Can you think of it as a spicy shabu-shabu?

1629
01:05:59,574 --> 01:06:02,074
- The spiciness is different. / - Yes.

1630
01:06:02,074 --> 01:06:05,774
- Aroma is important in this dish. / - That's right.

1631
01:06:05,774 --> 01:06:08,974
It's not spicier than Cheongyang chili.

1632
01:06:08,974 --> 01:06:12,574
It's not that kind of spiciness. It builds up gradually.

1633
01:06:12,574 --> 01:06:15,174
I continue to eat more because I get greedy

1634
01:06:15,174 --> 01:06:16,674
thinking that it won't get any spicier.

1635
01:06:16,674 --> 01:06:18,074
It's delicious.

1636
01:06:19,074 --> 01:06:21,440
- It makes you angry? / - It makes me really angry.

1637
01:06:23,307 --> 01:06:24,874
Why do I have to eat this?

1638
01:06:24,874 --> 01:06:27,474
- Honestly, I'm going to eat more. / - Eat some more.

1639
01:06:27,474 --> 01:06:28,940
I'm going to eat more.

1640
01:06:29,774 --> 01:06:31,507
- These are bamboo shoots... / - Yes.

1641
01:06:31,507 --> 01:06:34,740
- Bamboo shoots. / - With shrimp inside.

1642
01:06:34,740 --> 01:06:36,807
They put shrimp wontons in bamboo shoots.

1643
01:06:36,807 --> 01:06:38,140
- Inside there? / - The texture is amazing.

1644
01:06:38,140 --> 01:06:41,074
- That looks so good. / - It was so interesting.

1645
01:06:41,074 --> 01:06:46,007
(How does the bamboo shoots with shrimp taste?)

1646
01:06:47,507 --> 01:06:48,507
Let's try it.

1647
01:06:50,307 --> 01:06:51,874
- Isn't it good and interesting? / - It's good.

1648
01:06:51,874 --> 01:06:53,640
(She is in awe as soon as she eats it)

1649
01:06:53,640 --> 01:06:55,840
I've never tasted something like this.

1650
01:06:55,840 --> 01:06:57,474
(She's mad again)

1651
01:06:57,940 --> 01:06:59,574
The inside is so tender

1652
01:06:59,574 --> 01:07:03,107
but the bamboo shoot doesn't taste like

1653
01:07:03,107 --> 01:07:04,674
the ones we usually have.

1654
01:07:04,940 --> 01:07:09,840
It feels like we're eating salmon roe. It's popping.

1655
01:07:09,840 --> 01:07:11,440
No one will never know that it's bamboo shoot

1656
01:07:11,440 --> 01:07:12,540
if you don't tell them.

1657
01:07:12,540 --> 01:07:15,174
It's crisp when you bite into it.

1658
01:07:15,174 --> 01:07:17,740
You can tell it's bamboo shoot as you eat it.

1659
01:07:17,840 --> 01:07:19,340
You really have to order this.

1660
01:07:19,340 --> 01:07:21,574
- Why? / - A lot of people miss this.

1661
01:07:21,574 --> 01:07:22,907
You really have to order this.

1662
01:07:22,907 --> 01:07:25,440
- Okay. / - It's a unique taste.

1663
01:07:26,374 --> 01:07:28,540
I'm going to try this next.

1664
01:07:29,374 --> 01:07:30,540
I'm going to make this in a wrap.

1665
01:07:31,374 --> 01:07:32,607
I've dipped it.

1666
01:07:37,807 --> 01:07:39,474
(She's impressed)

1667
01:07:39,807 --> 01:07:42,074
I think I can manage the spiciness now.

1668
01:07:42,074 --> 01:07:43,607
I'm completely fine right now.

1669
01:07:44,040 --> 01:07:46,540
Can we try a spicier level then?

1670
01:07:46,540 --> 01:07:47,807
Can we try a spicier one?

1671
01:07:47,807 --> 01:07:49,307
(It's hard to hide her shaking eyes and hands)

1672
01:07:49,307 --> 01:07:50,874
I think I can try it.

1673
01:07:51,640 --> 01:07:55,240
How can she...

1674
01:07:55,240 --> 01:07:55,807
(It makes you doubt your very eyes)

1675
01:07:55,807 --> 01:07:57,607
How will she...

1676
01:07:58,307 --> 01:08:01,407
- That's just the next level. / - You have to look inside.

1677
01:08:01,407 --> 01:08:02,640
(Unbelievable)

1678
01:08:02,640 --> 01:08:03,840
Really good!

1679
01:08:04,574 --> 01:08:05,874
No way.

1680
01:08:05,874 --> 01:08:07,207
Yujin.

1681
01:08:08,974 --> 01:08:10,274
This isn't a joke.

1682
01:08:10,274 --> 01:08:12,874
You should eat it like that since you're in Sichuan.

1683
01:08:13,507 --> 01:08:15,607
It's different to putting Cheongyang chilies in.

1684
01:08:15,607 --> 01:08:17,240
I'm starting to sweat from my head already.

1685
01:08:18,174 --> 01:08:20,574
- That's amazing. / - Look at Yujin's face.

1686
01:08:20,574 --> 01:08:22,240
- Nice reaction. / - It's free to order...

1687
01:08:22,240 --> 01:08:24,140
The next level of spiciness.

1688
01:08:24,674 --> 01:08:26,574
(Forced smile)

1689
01:08:26,574 --> 01:08:27,940
She can't stop laughing.

1690
01:08:29,107 --> 01:08:31,807
(What am I going to do?)

1691
01:08:31,807 --> 01:08:32,707
What level is that?

1692
01:08:32,707 --> 01:08:34,207
- It's the last level. / - It's level three.

1693
01:08:34,207 --> 01:08:36,740
It's the spiciest level.

1694
01:08:37,107 --> 01:08:37,974
Raeyeon is amazing.

1695
01:08:37,974 --> 01:08:40,940
It will taste the best if you put noodles in there.

1696
01:08:44,174 --> 01:08:45,574
(She's caught)

1697
01:08:47,074 --> 01:08:48,407
That means it's spicy for her.

1698
01:08:49,407 --> 01:08:50,807
It's spicy!

1699
01:08:51,507 --> 01:08:52,674
That means it's spicy for her.

1700
01:08:52,807 --> 01:08:54,407
- Wipe your mouth. / - Wait.

1701
01:08:55,307 --> 01:08:57,907
I'm fine. I'll explain.

1702
01:08:58,207 --> 01:08:59,207
(She starts to show off when it comes to hot pot)

1703
01:08:59,207 --> 01:09:02,740
It choked me when I breathed but it's not spicy.

1704
01:09:02,740 --> 01:09:04,640
Touch my throat, it's not hot at all.

1705
01:09:05,474 --> 01:09:07,040
- I'm totally fine. / - It's really hot.

1706
01:09:08,607 --> 01:09:10,140
She's showing off. She's a show-off.

1707
01:09:10,140 --> 01:09:13,740
No, it's not spicy at all.

1708
01:09:14,307 --> 01:09:15,307
(Yujin just tries it)

1709
01:09:15,307 --> 01:09:16,474
She tries it.

1710
01:09:18,674 --> 01:09:19,907
This isn't a punishment.

1711
01:09:20,807 --> 01:09:21,974
Tell me.

1712
01:09:22,807 --> 01:09:24,040
This is really funny.

1713
01:09:26,307 --> 01:09:27,740
My ears are hot.

1714
01:09:28,840 --> 01:09:30,840
It's because you picked your ears.

1715
01:09:31,440 --> 01:09:34,340
Level 3 isn't that bad.

1716
01:09:34,340 --> 01:09:35,574
(It's time to evaluate the level 3 spiciness)

1717
01:09:35,607 --> 01:09:37,740
- 1, 2, 3. / - 1, 2, 3.

1718
01:09:37,740 --> 01:09:39,207
- Really good. / - Really good.

1719
01:09:39,840 --> 01:09:44,240
Undoubtedly, it's really good and unique.

1720
01:09:44,474 --> 01:09:46,974
- I really enjoyed it. / - Yes.

1721
01:09:47,740 --> 01:09:51,974
It's really, really, really good!

1722
01:09:52,940 --> 01:09:54,474
They ate all of it.

1723
01:09:54,607 --> 01:09:56,140
- There's nothing left. / - We ate all of it.

1724
01:09:56,140 --> 01:09:58,074
- We ate all of it. / - We ate all of it.

1725
01:09:58,074 --> 01:10:01,174
We still have some time left until our flight.

1726
01:10:01,174 --> 01:10:03,140
- We still have time. / - That's right.

1727
01:10:03,140 --> 01:10:05,074
We can't give up this time.

1728
01:10:05,074 --> 01:10:06,907
- Let's go to the Anshun Bridge. / - Okay.

1729
01:10:06,907 --> 01:10:09,874
It's like the Venice of Sichuan.

1730
01:10:09,874 --> 01:10:13,340
There is a river, pretty coffee shops and bars.

1731
01:10:13,340 --> 01:10:14,807
We'll spend some time there

1732
01:10:14,807 --> 01:10:17,740
to make us feel better and go to the airport.

1733
01:10:17,740 --> 01:10:19,374
- Okay? / - Okay.

1734
01:10:19,374 --> 01:10:20,874
We took a late flight.

1735
01:10:20,874 --> 01:10:22,774
It was early in the morning the next day.

1736
01:10:22,974 --> 01:10:24,540
(Sights, Food)

1737
01:10:24,540 --> 01:10:26,107
(Sights)

1738
01:10:26,107 --> 01:10:28,940
(Anshun Bridge)

1739
01:10:30,940 --> 01:10:33,307
- The night view is amazing. / - It's so beautiful.

1740
01:10:33,307 --> 01:10:34,507
This place was really nice.

1741
01:10:43,774 --> 01:10:46,740
It's too sad to just go to the airport like this,

1742
01:10:46,740 --> 01:10:48,807
and we still have time.

1743
01:10:48,807 --> 01:10:49,507
We came for the night view.

1744
01:10:49,507 --> 01:10:51,774
The night view is amazing. This is Anshun Bridge.

1745
01:10:51,774 --> 01:10:53,674
- It's so pretty. / - Isn't it so pretty?

1746
01:10:53,674 --> 01:10:56,474
"Pretty" isn't enough to explain this view.

1747
01:10:56,474 --> 01:10:57,540
(Anshun Bridge feels like it's representing China)

1748
01:10:57,540 --> 01:10:58,774
It's really beautiful.

1749
01:10:58,774 --> 01:11:01,374
It feels like it's representing China.

1750
01:11:02,940 --> 01:11:05,974
- Isn't it amazing? / - Yes, it's so nice.

1751
01:11:05,974 --> 01:11:09,274
There's nothing that's a waste of time...

1752
01:11:09,274 --> 01:11:12,140
- In Chengdu. / - That's so right.

1753
01:11:13,774 --> 01:11:19,007
(It's time to end the Zhendehao Tour)

1754
01:11:20,240 --> 01:11:22,407
- It was really nice, right? / - Yes.

1755
01:11:23,240 --> 01:11:25,107
It was really special for me.

1756
01:11:25,107 --> 01:11:29,240
This trip was the first trip I went on with a friend

1757
01:11:29,240 --> 01:11:33,240
after I got married and had babies.

1758
01:11:33,240 --> 01:11:35,874
- It felt like a dream. / - Yes.

1759
01:11:35,874 --> 01:11:38,740
I was just really happy.

1760
01:11:39,507 --> 01:11:42,474
I really enjoyed it especially because I was with you.

1761
01:11:42,774 --> 01:11:44,907
Do we have to cry now?

1762
01:11:44,907 --> 01:11:47,140
Are you trying to make me cry?

1763
01:11:47,140 --> 01:11:49,840
I liked Kuan Zhai Xiang Zi where we went first.

1764
01:11:49,840 --> 01:11:52,107
- Yes, the alleys. / - We went shopping there.

1765
01:11:52,107 --> 01:11:54,974
Watching the street vendors and watching the people.

1766
01:11:54,974 --> 01:11:57,874
It was a short schedule but there was a lot to do.

1767
01:11:57,874 --> 01:11:59,307
- That's right. / - Yes.

1768
01:11:59,307 --> 01:12:00,840
- Everything went well. / - That's right.

1769
01:12:00,840 --> 01:12:04,440
- The mapo tofu was intense. / - Yes.

1770
01:12:04,440 --> 01:12:05,107
It was good.

1771
01:12:05,107 --> 01:12:07,474
It was the food that made me realize

1772
01:12:07,474 --> 01:12:09,640
that I was really in Sichuan.

1773
01:12:09,907 --> 01:12:11,740
Hot pot is also a traditional food in Sichuan.

1774
01:12:11,740 --> 01:12:12,640
Right.

1775
01:12:12,640 --> 01:12:14,207
I was really happy because you reserved

1776
01:12:14,207 --> 01:12:15,274
such a nice restaurant.

1777
01:12:15,274 --> 01:12:16,440
It was fun.

1778
01:12:16,840 --> 01:12:18,540
It was such a special time.

1779
01:12:18,540 --> 01:12:21,340
The person who ordered to add more spiciness

1780
01:12:21,340 --> 01:12:22,607
was you, not me.

1781
01:12:23,140 --> 01:12:24,207
It was amazing.

1782
01:12:24,207 --> 01:12:25,807
I didn't know they would add so much.

1783
01:12:25,807 --> 01:12:28,740
- It's still spicy. / - I was...

1784
01:12:28,740 --> 01:12:31,974
Don't even talk about it. It still hurts my stomach.

1785
01:12:32,440 --> 01:12:35,674
Let's go to the airport. Let's go.

1786
01:12:35,674 --> 01:12:37,607
I have to go back to my kids now.

1787
01:12:38,540 --> 01:12:40,507
Kids, wait for me.

1788
01:12:42,240 --> 01:12:46,574
(The End of the Zhendehao Tour's Chengdu trip)

1789
01:12:49,940 --> 01:12:51,574
(The trip was as plentiful as we expected)

1790
01:12:51,574 --> 01:12:53,507
Our team had the whale shark

1791
01:12:53,507 --> 01:12:55,840
but they had the adorable pandas.

1792
01:12:56,140 --> 01:12:58,407
I thought the panda was a doll.

1793
01:12:58,407 --> 01:13:00,307
- It was so amazing to see it move. / - It was wriggling.

1794
01:13:00,307 --> 01:13:02,774
- Pandas aren't just... / - It's so funny.

1795
01:13:02,774 --> 01:13:04,840
An animal in China.

1796
01:13:04,840 --> 01:13:06,907
- They're symbolic. / - That's right.

1797
01:13:06,907 --> 01:13:11,640
Since pandas are continuing to disappear,

1798
01:13:11,640 --> 01:13:14,507
they do artificial insemination for them there.

1799
01:13:15,140 --> 01:13:16,540
- Pandas are increasing. / - Then...

1800
01:13:16,540 --> 01:13:20,107
- They send them back to the wild? / - Yes, they do.

1801
01:13:20,107 --> 01:13:21,240
While we were watching it,

1802
01:13:21,240 --> 01:13:25,007
you went to Kuan Zhai Xiang Zi twice.

1803
01:13:25,007 --> 01:13:26,174
You went there to eat once,

1804
01:13:26,174 --> 01:13:27,507
and to sightsee another time.

1805
01:13:27,507 --> 01:13:29,174
You can go there every day.

1806
01:13:29,174 --> 01:13:31,274
- Really? / - Even if you go there every day...

1807
01:13:31,274 --> 01:13:33,840
You can't see everything nor eat everything there.

1808
01:13:33,840 --> 01:13:34,774
Is there anywhere else

1809
01:13:34,774 --> 01:13:36,840
you would like to recommend in Chengdu?

1810
01:13:36,840 --> 01:13:39,340
This place used to be Shu Han from

1811
01:13:39,340 --> 01:13:40,307
the "Records of the Three Kingdoms".

1812
01:13:40,307 --> 01:13:43,074
Wuhou Temple has Liu Bei's grave.

1813
01:13:43,074 --> 01:13:43,940
If you go there,

1814
01:13:43,940 --> 01:13:45,474
they have everything about

1815
01:13:45,474 --> 01:13:46,874
the "Records of the Three Kingdoms."

1816
01:13:47,207 --> 01:13:49,407
- You'll enjoy it if you like that. / - It will be like...

1817
01:13:49,407 --> 01:13:51,007
- The sacred place for men. / - Yes.

1818
01:13:51,007 --> 01:13:52,540
I think it will be really interesting.

1819
01:13:52,974 --> 01:13:56,307
There's a street called Jinli

1820
01:13:56,307 --> 01:13:58,007
that looks exactly like Shu Han.

1821
01:13:58,307 --> 01:14:01,274
There's a street like Kuan Zhai Xiang Zi.

1822
01:14:01,274 --> 01:14:02,874
There's a lot to see there.

1823
01:14:03,040 --> 01:14:04,474
There are so many places to see.

1824
01:14:04,674 --> 01:14:06,407
- I can't introduce all of it. / - Because it's so big.

1825
01:14:06,407 --> 01:14:08,374
Can't you just come with us whenever

1826
01:14:08,374 --> 01:14:09,607
there's a China special?

1827
01:14:09,607 --> 01:14:11,374
I wish I could do that.

1828
01:14:11,374 --> 01:14:12,474
I enjoyed it so much.

1829
01:14:12,474 --> 01:14:14,974
- It's so nice. / - Let's see the final expense.

1830
01:14:14,974 --> 01:14:18,074
Last week, 52 Tour spent $285.

1831
01:14:18,074 --> 01:14:20,640
- It was for 52 hours. / - Yes, $285.

1832
01:14:20,640 --> 01:14:24,440
For 2 nights and 3 days, the final expense...

1833
01:14:24,440 --> 01:14:25,807
- In Chengdu is... / - What's the final expense?

1834
01:14:25,807 --> 01:14:27,240
- The airfare is excluded. / - For one person is...

1835
01:14:27,240 --> 01:14:29,807
- For one person? / - Including the accommodation.

1836
01:14:30,307 --> 01:14:31,740
The total came to...

1837
01:14:32,007 --> 01:14:34,707
- $269. / - Really?

1838
01:14:34,707 --> 01:14:36,607
- It's cheap. / - Wait a minute.

1839
01:14:36,607 --> 01:14:39,540
Aren't the prices cheaper in the Philippines?

1840
01:14:39,540 --> 01:14:40,674
Sichuan is also cheap.

1841
01:14:40,974 --> 01:14:41,940
- China is also cheap. / - But Sichuan...

1842
01:14:41,940 --> 01:14:43,440
China is also cheap.

1843
01:14:43,840 --> 01:14:45,107
Are you ready to vote?

1844
01:14:45,107 --> 01:14:47,107
Would you go to Chengdu according

1845
01:14:47,107 --> 01:14:48,007
to the Zhendehao Tour?

1846
01:14:48,007 --> 01:14:50,607
- Please vote. / - Please vote.

1847
01:14:51,640 --> 01:14:54,707
(They planned a last-minute summer vacation trip)

1848
01:14:54,707 --> 01:14:59,407
(What will the judges choose?)

1849
01:15:01,240 --> 01:15:04,140
Will it be 52 Tour's Cebu trip

1850
01:15:04,140 --> 01:15:06,874
that had an uncommon course?

1851
01:15:06,874 --> 01:15:10,307
Or will it be Zhendehao Tour's Chengdu trip where

1852
01:15:10,307 --> 01:15:14,107
they had both amazing things to eat and see.

1853
01:15:14,807 --> 01:15:15,974
It's so close.

1854
01:15:15,974 --> 01:15:18,174
What will the judges choose?

1855
01:15:18,174 --> 01:15:19,540
Please.

1856
01:15:19,540 --> 01:15:21,474
(Cebu vs. Chengdu)

1857
01:15:21,474 --> 01:15:22,574
- Let's just make it a tie. / - Oh, my.

1858
01:15:22,574 --> 01:15:24,707
I don't know why I get so nervous.

1859
01:15:24,707 --> 01:15:26,707
- Why am I so nervous? / - It makes you nervous.

1860
01:15:26,707 --> 01:15:28,040
- I don't know what to do. / - First win.

1861
01:15:28,040 --> 01:15:29,374
I think we're going to see the first digit.

1862
01:15:29,374 --> 01:15:31,007
- The first digit. / - First digit.

1863
01:15:31,007 --> 01:15:33,240
- I think it will be high. / - Both trips were really nice.

1864
01:15:33,240 --> 01:15:34,907
- It's the first digit. / - They were really nice.

1865
01:15:34,907 --> 01:15:36,107
It's 7.

1866
01:15:36,107 --> 01:15:38,274
- It was nice. / - It's 7.

1867
01:15:38,274 --> 01:15:39,474
They are both 7.

1868
01:15:39,474 --> 01:15:40,674
The first digits are all 7.

1869
01:15:40,874 --> 01:15:41,774
- We will win. / - Show us the results.

1870
01:15:41,774 --> 01:15:43,807
- 52 Tour. / - You surprised me.

1871
01:15:43,807 --> 01:15:45,674
- 52 Tour. / - What will be the result?

1872
01:15:45,974 --> 01:15:47,540
- 52 Tour. / - 52 Tour.

1873
01:15:48,040 --> 01:15:49,074
52 Tour.

1874
01:15:49,074 --> 01:15:51,340
- 52 Tour. / - 52 Tour.

1875
01:15:51,340 --> 01:15:53,507
(76 vs. 78, Zhendehao Tour won)

1876
01:15:53,507 --> 01:15:54,540
We won.

1877
01:15:54,640 --> 01:15:56,174
China won by two points.

1878
01:15:56,174 --> 01:15:57,540
We won.

1879
01:15:57,774 --> 01:15:59,207
- We won. / - We won.

1880
01:15:59,274 --> 01:16:01,040
(It was so close)

1881
01:16:01,040 --> 01:16:02,307
This is...

1882
01:16:02,840 --> 01:16:04,074
- This is amazing. / - This is amazing.

1883
01:16:04,074 --> 01:16:05,274
- Congratulations. / - Thank you.

1884
01:16:05,274 --> 01:16:07,407
I will really go and see the whale sharks though.

1885
01:16:07,407 --> 01:16:08,440
You should really see it.

1886
01:16:08,440 --> 01:16:09,474
It was unexpected.

1887
01:16:09,474 --> 01:16:10,640
Both trips were nice,

1888
01:16:10,640 --> 01:16:13,207
that's why it was so close at the end.

1889
01:16:13,207 --> 01:16:15,474
- Kim Iljung was with us today. / - Yes.

1890
01:16:15,474 --> 01:16:16,907
How was it for the last 2 weeks?

1891
01:16:16,907 --> 01:16:17,640
I really enjoyed it.

1892
01:16:17,640 --> 01:16:20,107
Before my family went to the U.S. to study,

1893
01:16:20,107 --> 01:16:21,740
we went to Cebu.

1894
01:16:22,040 --> 01:16:23,140
But we only stayed at the resort,

1895
01:16:23,140 --> 01:16:25,874
so I think my children will really like the whale sharks.

1896
01:16:25,874 --> 01:16:28,040
My wife also likes spicy food.

1897
01:16:28,040 --> 01:16:29,474
So I want to go to Chengdu to eat that with her.

1898
01:16:29,474 --> 01:16:31,774
Since I'm thinking about my family...

1899
01:16:32,240 --> 01:16:34,474
I really miss them but 3 weeks have passed already.

1900
01:16:34,474 --> 01:16:37,340
- Already? / - I don't know what he means.

1901
01:16:37,474 --> 01:16:40,207
A special is prepared for next week's Battle Trip.

1902
01:16:40,207 --> 01:16:41,407
- Is it another special? / - Really?

1903
01:16:41,407 --> 01:16:43,274
- It's expected now. / - Yes.

1904
01:16:43,507 --> 01:16:45,407
We had a married couple special...

1905
01:16:45,407 --> 01:16:47,707
