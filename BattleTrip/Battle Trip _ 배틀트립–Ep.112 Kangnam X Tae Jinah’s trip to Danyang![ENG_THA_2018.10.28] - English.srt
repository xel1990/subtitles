(Numerous great tips on trips)

00:00:03,807 --> 00:00:04,874
(Kim Sook, Sung Sikyung) 

3
00:00:05,474 --> 00:00:06,674
Travel is war... 

4
00:00:06,674 --> 00:00:08,807
Battle Trip! 

5
00:00:10,907 --> 00:00:14,041
We have a reliable special host here today. 

6
00:00:14,041 --> 00:00:16,374
It's Kim Hwan. Welcome. 

7
00:00:16,374 --> 00:00:18,107
- Nice to meet you. / - Welcome. 

8
00:00:18,107 --> 00:00:19,174
Nice to meet you. 

9
00:00:19,441 --> 00:00:20,841
Do you like traveling? 

10
00:00:20,841 --> 00:00:22,074
- I like it a lot. / - Okay. 

11
00:00:22,074 --> 00:00:24,574
I really do but I don't do it a lot these days 

12
00:00:24,574 --> 00:00:25,874
because of the baby. 

13
00:00:25,874 --> 00:00:28,007
- You have a baby? / - Yes, she's 7 months old. 

14
00:00:28,007 --> 00:00:29,807
7 months? You can't go anywhere then. 

15
00:00:29,807 --> 00:00:31,641
- I can't even leave the house. / - I see. 

16
00:00:31,641 --> 00:00:33,807
Actually, the weather is really nice these days. 

17
00:00:34,207 --> 00:00:36,241
- It's perfect for traveling. / - Right. 

18
00:00:36,241 --> 00:00:38,374
It's the best season for domestic trips. 

19
00:00:38,374 --> 00:00:39,741
- That's correct. / - Where do you want to go? 

20
00:00:39,741 --> 00:00:40,574
- Me? / - Yes. 

21
00:00:40,574 --> 00:00:43,541
There's a ginkgo forest in Hongcheon. 

22
00:00:43,674 --> 00:00:45,441
- A ginkgo forest? / - Yes, there's a ginkgo forest. 

23
00:00:45,441 --> 00:00:46,874
- This place is... / - Stop it. 

24
00:00:46,874 --> 00:00:48,174
Just thinking about it makes me so sad. 

25
00:00:48,174 --> 00:00:51,207
- Why? / - Imagine you walking in the forest alone... 

26
00:00:51,207 --> 00:00:52,941
- In fall. / - What about it? 

27
00:00:52,941 --> 00:00:54,741
I'm going to go there with a wedding dress on. 

28
00:00:54,741 --> 00:00:57,141
- You'll take pictures alone. / - I need to take photos. 

29
00:00:57,141 --> 00:00:58,841
I think it'd be really nice to dress up and go there. 

30
00:00:58,841 --> 00:01:00,441
You're not going to just see the trees in Hongcheon. 

31
00:01:00,441 --> 00:01:02,941
I'll eat chili pepper paste pork belly 

32
00:01:02,941 --> 00:01:04,074
while I'm in Hongcheon. 

33
00:01:04,074 --> 00:01:06,307
The charcoal grilled one. 

34
00:01:06,307 --> 00:01:08,507
I should eat a piece of that. 

35
00:01:09,307 --> 00:01:12,874
Since it's fall, many people go see the foliage. 

36
00:01:12,874 --> 00:01:16,441
Different regions have different times for foliage. 

37
00:01:16,441 --> 00:01:18,841
So we prepared a 2018 fall foliage map. 

38
00:01:18,841 --> 00:01:20,007
- There's a fall foliage map? / - That'll be great. 

39
00:01:20,007 --> 00:01:21,907
- Shall we have a look? / - Let's check it out. 

40
00:01:22,341 --> 00:01:24,041
- So this is how it looks. / - Like this. 

41
00:01:24,041 --> 00:01:25,407
It starts from the top. 

42
00:01:25,407 --> 00:01:27,207
- It starts from Gangwon-do. / - From October 20th... 

43
00:01:27,207 --> 00:01:29,207
- October 17th. / - It goes down south. 

44
00:01:29,207 --> 00:01:30,807
Until early November, 

45
00:01:30,807 --> 00:01:34,074
you can see the foliage in Mudeungsan in Gwangju. 

46
00:01:34,541 --> 00:01:36,641
The further south you go, the longer you can enjoy it. 

47
00:01:36,641 --> 00:01:38,774
You're right. It'd be great to travel every week... 

48
00:01:38,774 --> 00:01:40,641
- Until early November. / - That sounds great. 

49
00:01:41,074 --> 00:01:41,974
Check out the foliage here... 

50
00:01:41,974 --> 00:01:43,907
- Then go down south. / - Go south to the next area. 

51
00:01:43,907 --> 00:01:44,941
All the way to the end. 

52
00:01:44,941 --> 00:01:46,574
If you're wondering what to do 

53
00:01:46,574 --> 00:01:48,407
besides seeing the foliage, 

54
00:01:48,407 --> 00:01:50,907
you should check out the domestic trips on this show. 

55
00:01:50,907 --> 00:01:53,441
If you want to go to Seoraksan, 

56
00:01:53,441 --> 00:01:55,241
check out our Sokcho and Yangyang episode. 

57
00:01:55,241 --> 00:01:56,907
It's packed with great information. 

58
00:01:56,907 --> 00:01:58,907
And if you're going to Jirisan, 

59
00:01:58,907 --> 00:02:01,541
our Hadong episode will be really great. 

60
00:02:01,541 --> 00:02:05,841
Actually, today's theme is domestic fall trips. 

61
00:02:05,841 --> 00:02:08,174
Battle Trip will not just let... 

62
00:02:08,174 --> 00:02:09,974
- This fall pass by. / - That's right. 

63
00:02:09,974 --> 00:02:12,041
- We prepared... / - I love domestic fall trips. 

64
00:02:12,041 --> 00:02:13,607
Hidden cards to... 

65
00:02:13,607 --> 00:02:15,941
- Make the trip even better. / - Hidden cards? 

66
00:02:15,941 --> 00:02:18,074
- Yes. / - Each team has a hidden card. 

67
00:02:18,074 --> 00:02:19,907
So please stay tuned until the end. 

68
00:02:19,907 --> 00:02:22,074
You'll be very surprised by the hidden cards. 

69
00:02:22,074 --> 00:02:23,907
Now, let me introduce the trip planners. 

70
00:02:23,907 --> 00:02:25,041
(Who are the trip planners?) 

71
00:02:25,041 --> 00:02:27,341
They're holding their hands. 

72
00:02:28,574 --> 00:02:30,174
(Kangnam, Tae Jinah) 

73
00:02:30,874 --> 00:02:32,041
(Mun Cheonsik, Shim Hyunbo) 

74
00:02:32,041 --> 00:02:34,041
Actually, our team has an advantage. 

75
00:02:34,541 --> 00:02:39,007
Jinah has more than 300 concerts 

76
00:02:39,007 --> 00:02:40,307
per year in Korea alone. 

77
00:02:40,574 --> 00:02:41,807
300 concerts a year? 

78
00:02:41,807 --> 00:02:43,241
- 300 concerts a year. / - That's almost one every day. 

79
00:02:43,241 --> 00:02:44,341
- It's almost every day. / - It's almost every day. 

80
00:02:44,341 --> 00:02:47,541
He's been to everywhere in Korea. 

81
00:02:47,541 --> 00:02:49,341
He knows a lot of great restaurants. 

82
00:02:49,341 --> 00:02:52,141
After work, you go to the local restaurant, right? 

83
00:02:52,141 --> 00:02:53,607
So he must know a lot about local restaurants. 

84
00:02:53,607 --> 00:02:54,807
He surely must. 

85
00:02:54,807 --> 00:02:59,907
Since "Okgyeong" totally flipped... 

86
00:03:00,674 --> 00:03:02,741
- People usually say, "It's a big hit." / - Yes. 

87
00:03:02,741 --> 00:03:05,307
But in Chungcheong-do, we say, "It totally flipped." 

88
00:03:06,141 --> 00:03:08,674
The song totally flipped and I traveled the country. 

89
00:03:08,874 --> 00:03:12,441
And this year, I released "Jangjigijang." 

90
00:03:12,441 --> 00:03:13,841
- Did it flip over again? / - That flipped too. 

91
00:03:13,841 --> 00:03:15,474
It kept flipping over. 

92
00:03:15,474 --> 00:03:16,874
- So... / - It must be your fate. 

93
00:03:16,874 --> 00:03:18,474
Did your trip flip over too? 

94
00:03:18,474 --> 00:03:20,641
- We went on a trip! / - Yes. 

95
00:03:20,641 --> 00:03:22,741
It totally flipped there! 

96
00:03:22,741 --> 00:03:25,507
It was insane. You'll see soon. 

97
00:03:25,507 --> 00:03:27,374
Because Kangnam was hanging out with me... 

98
00:03:27,374 --> 00:03:28,407
- He almost... / - I gained weight. 

99
00:03:28,407 --> 00:03:29,141
You did, right? 

100
00:03:29,141 --> 00:03:30,441
- You gained a lot of weight. / - He looks like he did. 

101
00:03:30,441 --> 00:03:32,674
- I think he gained about 5kg. / - I gained about 5kg. 

102
00:03:32,674 --> 00:03:33,974
Was it because of the restaurants? 

103
00:03:33,974 --> 00:03:36,641
We're always in the countryside, at good restaurants. 

104
00:03:36,641 --> 00:03:38,341
After the concert, we eat again. 

105
00:03:38,341 --> 00:03:39,507
He always says I should lose weight but 

106
00:03:39,507 --> 00:03:40,841
he always feeds me. 

107
00:03:42,107 --> 00:03:43,641
- Then today... / - Then... 

108
00:03:43,641 --> 00:03:47,141
How did your trip flip over, Hyunbo and Cheonsik? 

109
00:03:47,274 --> 00:03:48,507
Before we talk about our trip, 

110
00:03:48,507 --> 00:03:49,607
we should talk about Sikyung first. 

111
00:03:49,607 --> 00:03:50,874
- He's right. / - Really? 

112
00:03:50,874 --> 00:03:53,341
- When Sikyung was a radio DJ... / - Yes. 

113
00:03:53,341 --> 00:03:55,041
We were guests on his show. 

114
00:03:55,041 --> 00:03:58,441
Since Sikyung was the DJ, we went drinking often. 

115
00:03:58,941 --> 00:04:01,474
We naturally became close. We're soulmates. 

116
00:04:01,807 --> 00:04:02,941
So you're drinking buddies. 

117
00:04:02,941 --> 00:04:04,674
- Exactly. / - How was it? 

118
00:04:04,674 --> 00:04:07,307
I heard you two didn't travel alone. 

119
00:04:08,007 --> 00:04:09,574
- Hidden card? / - There's a highlight. 

120
00:04:09,841 --> 00:04:12,274
We prepared a hidden card for our trip. 

121
00:04:12,274 --> 00:04:14,541
The hidden card joined us for the trip. 

122
00:04:14,774 --> 00:04:16,074
- Isn't it cheating? / - I know. 

123
00:04:16,074 --> 00:04:17,741
- The hidden card joined you? / - Then the trip... 

124
00:04:17,741 --> 00:04:18,974
They could have brought... 

125
00:04:18,974 --> 00:04:21,274
Hong Jinyoung too. That would have been really fun. 

126
00:04:21,274 --> 00:04:23,474
- Actually, we had someone like her. / - You did? 

127
00:04:23,474 --> 00:04:24,307
- Hong Jinyoung? / - Did someone else join you? 

128
00:04:24,307 --> 00:04:25,841
That's a secret. 

129
00:04:25,841 --> 00:04:27,641
- Someone like her? / - Someone similar to her? 

130
00:04:27,641 --> 00:04:29,074
- No one can be like Jinyoung. / - No one is like her. 

131
00:04:29,207 --> 00:04:30,807
They do things like, "You?" 

132
00:04:30,807 --> 00:04:32,474
- This person is almost like her. / - Almost like her. 

133
00:04:32,474 --> 00:04:34,074
- Really? / - This person flipped over too. 

134
00:04:34,074 --> 00:04:35,541
- You'll see. / - You'll see. 

135
00:04:35,541 --> 00:04:37,141
- Hong Jinyoung? / - And... 

136
00:04:37,141 --> 00:04:39,507
Both Kangnam and Cheonsik... 

137
00:04:39,507 --> 00:04:41,441
Once won on this show. 

138
00:04:41,441 --> 00:04:41,774
Right. 

139
00:04:41,774 --> 00:04:42,941
- You did? / - Yes. 

140
00:04:42,941 --> 00:04:44,107
- Really? / - This can be a title match. 

141
00:04:44,107 --> 00:04:45,141
Where did they go then? 

142
00:04:45,141 --> 00:04:46,374
Cancun. 

143
00:04:46,374 --> 00:04:48,074
- Cancun. / - Cancun was a lot of fun. 

144
00:04:48,074 --> 00:04:50,641
- What about you, Cheonsik? / - Tokyo with Sikyung. 

145
00:04:50,641 --> 00:04:52,641
- Tokyo? / - You went to Tokyo? 

146
00:04:52,841 --> 00:04:53,874
They had egg sandwiches and... 

147
00:04:53,874 --> 00:04:56,074
Shouldn't I go there? That's my home. 

148
00:04:56,074 --> 00:04:57,474
No, Kangnam, you can't. 

149
00:04:57,474 --> 00:05:00,207
Let's get back to today's theme, fall trip. 

150
00:05:00,341 --> 00:05:01,541
Where did you go? 

151
00:05:01,541 --> 00:05:03,207
- Our trip was... / - Yes. 

152
00:05:03,207 --> 00:05:04,874
- About history. / - History. 

153
00:05:04,874 --> 00:05:06,641
- Goguryeo. / - Goguryeo. 

154
00:05:06,641 --> 00:05:08,041
- Silla. / - Silla. 

155
00:05:08,407 --> 00:05:09,574
- Baekje. / - Baekje. 

156
00:05:09,574 --> 00:05:11,241
Many KBS historical dramas 

157
00:05:11,241 --> 00:05:12,807
were set in this place. 

158
00:05:13,074 --> 00:05:14,674
That's where we went. 

159
00:05:14,674 --> 00:05:16,274
There are 10 minus 2 peaks there. 

160
00:05:16,441 --> 00:05:17,907
- 10 minus 2 peaks? / - 10 minus 2. 

161
00:05:17,907 --> 00:05:19,541
- You mean 8? / - Yes, 8 peaks. 

162
00:05:19,541 --> 00:05:22,441
- I think I know where it is. / - You said it weird. 

163
00:05:22,441 --> 00:05:23,741
- It's in Chungcheong-do. / - Yes. 

164
00:05:23,941 --> 00:05:27,507
- Danyang. / - Danyang. 

165
00:05:27,507 --> 00:05:29,274
I went there on "2 Days and 1 Night." 

166
00:05:29,274 --> 00:05:30,974
It's really beautiful there. 

167
00:05:30,974 --> 00:05:33,107
Danyang is in the center of Korea, 

168
00:05:33,107 --> 00:05:35,341
so you can get to any place 

169
00:05:35,341 --> 00:05:36,841
within 3 hours from there. 

170
00:05:36,841 --> 00:05:38,941
- It's in the center of Korea. / - Exactly. 

171
00:05:38,941 --> 00:05:40,741
It's within easy access of everywhere. 

172
00:05:40,741 --> 00:05:42,207
- It is. / - It was very beautiful too. 

173
00:05:42,207 --> 00:05:44,574
- It was incredibly beautiful. / - Danyang is famous... 

174
00:05:44,574 --> 00:05:45,841
- For the 8 beautiful views. / - It is. 

175
00:05:45,841 --> 00:05:48,074
Alright. And where did our team go? 

176
00:05:48,074 --> 00:05:52,274
Fall is when you're allowed to gain weight, isn't it? 

177
00:05:52,274 --> 00:05:54,307
- We wanted to have a gourmet tour... / - Yes. 

178
00:05:54,307 --> 00:05:55,507
So we went to Jeolla-do. 

179
00:05:55,507 --> 00:05:57,341
- Jeolla-do. / - Food there is delicious. 

180
00:05:57,341 --> 00:05:58,741
Jeolla-do is famous for great food. 

181
00:05:58,741 --> 00:05:59,841
We have a good chance to win. 

182
00:05:59,841 --> 00:06:01,107
- Where in Jeolla-do? / - Where? 

183
00:06:01,107 --> 00:06:03,674
Let me give you some hints. It's a harbor city. 

184
00:06:03,674 --> 00:06:04,807
- Harbor? / - It's a harbor city. 

185
00:06:04,807 --> 00:06:06,907
It's a city of art and culture in the south. 

186
00:06:07,374 --> 00:06:08,874
It's obvious. 

187
00:06:08,874 --> 00:06:11,307
♪ Mokpo is a harbor ♪ 

188
00:06:11,307 --> 00:06:12,507
It must be Mokpo. 

189
00:06:12,507 --> 00:06:13,741
He got us. 

190
00:06:13,941 --> 00:06:15,407
He knows all the cities in the country. 

191
00:06:15,407 --> 00:06:17,174
He knows the place right away. 

192
00:06:17,174 --> 00:06:19,707
He spoiled the fun but yes, they went to Mokpo. 

193
00:06:19,707 --> 00:06:20,874
(Mokpo, Jeollanam-do) 

194
00:06:20,874 --> 00:06:23,474
On top of that, we had fermented skate and octopus. 

195
00:06:24,074 --> 00:06:25,107
Fermented skate and octopus. 

196
00:06:25,107 --> 00:06:27,907
Heuksando has amazing fermented skate. 

197
00:06:27,907 --> 00:06:28,974
That's true. 

198
00:06:29,207 --> 00:06:30,341
They have the best fermented skate. 

199
00:06:30,341 --> 00:06:32,074
You don't say you had fermented skate in Mokpo. 

200
00:06:32,074 --> 00:06:33,607
You say you had long-legged octopus in Mokpo. 

201
00:06:33,607 --> 00:06:34,974
This is what you should say. 

202
00:06:34,974 --> 00:06:36,574
You can't say you had fermented skate in Mokpo. 

203
00:06:36,574 --> 00:06:38,141
It sounds like Mokpo has fermented skate. 

204
00:06:38,141 --> 00:06:40,807
While we were in Mokpo, we had... 

205
00:06:40,807 --> 00:06:42,607
- Fermented skate from Heuksando. / - There you go. 

206
00:06:42,607 --> 00:06:43,874
They sell good ones in Mokpo. 

207
00:06:44,207 --> 00:06:45,574
By any chance... 

208
00:06:45,574 --> 00:06:47,407
It's very tense today. 

209
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:49,841
Mokpo is actually... 

210
00:06:49,841 --> 00:06:51,407
- Pretty far. / - It is. 

211
00:06:51,407 --> 00:06:52,241
It's at the end of the country. 

212
00:06:52,241 --> 00:06:55,941
But it's very easy and convenient to get to Mokpo. 

213
00:06:56,207 --> 00:06:57,907
With the high-speed train, 

214
00:06:57,907 --> 00:06:59,641
it only takes 2 hours and 20 minutes. 

215
00:07:00,007 --> 00:07:02,474
Besides, once you get out of Mokpo Station, 

216
00:07:02,474 --> 00:07:04,241
you don't have to move far by car. 

217
00:07:04,241 --> 00:07:07,041
You can get anywhere in the city by foot. 

218
00:07:07,041 --> 00:07:08,207
- That's true. / - That's very nice. 

219
00:07:08,207 --> 00:07:10,007
You can go to all the restaurants by foot. 

220
00:07:10,007 --> 00:07:11,207
- Exactly. / - That's how we traveled. 

221
00:07:11,207 --> 00:07:13,007
As you can see, our team name is... 

222
00:07:13,007 --> 00:07:14,641
- Nilriri Mambo. / - Yes. 

223
00:07:15,241 --> 00:07:17,941
We walked a lot, ate and walked again. 

224
00:07:18,174 --> 00:07:20,341
We didn't suffer much to enjoy the trip. 

225
00:07:20,341 --> 00:07:22,141
- That's Mokpo. / - That's right. 

226
00:07:22,507 --> 00:07:25,674
You said we had a hidden card as well. 

227
00:07:25,674 --> 00:07:29,307
They said they have someone like Hong Jinyoung. 

228
00:07:29,307 --> 00:07:30,841
It's making me nervous. What's our hidden card? 

229
00:07:30,841 --> 00:07:32,741
Our hidden card won't lose out to theirs. 

230
00:07:32,741 --> 00:07:33,974
- Are you sure? / - Yes. 

231
00:07:33,974 --> 00:07:35,507
- I'm very sure. / - Alright. 

232
00:07:35,507 --> 00:07:37,841
It's a battle of fall trips, Danyang vs. Mokpo. 

233
00:07:37,841 --> 00:07:39,274
We have our 100 impartial judges 

234
00:07:39,274 --> 00:07:40,841
who will vote on today's trips. 

235
00:07:40,841 --> 00:07:43,174
- Welcome. / - Welcome. 

236
00:07:43,641 --> 00:07:45,974
I think it'll be hard for them to be impartial. 

237
00:07:46,374 --> 00:07:49,407
- They're all fans of Jinah. / - Thank you. 

238
00:07:49,707 --> 00:07:51,341
- Wow. / - His fans. 

239
00:07:53,874 --> 00:07:55,441
- We're going to lose. / - We'll lose. 

240
00:07:55,441 --> 00:07:55,974
Okay. 

241
00:07:55,974 --> 00:07:58,707
Let's check out Danyang first, since it's closer. 

242
00:07:58,707 --> 00:08:01,007
Could you tell us what we should focus on? 

243
00:08:01,007 --> 00:08:03,041
Something to focus on... 

244
00:08:03,041 --> 00:08:04,941
Danyang is at its 

245
00:08:04,941 --> 00:08:06,074
most beautiful this time of the year. 

246
00:08:06,074 --> 00:08:08,541
It's even better than when we were there. 

247
00:08:08,541 --> 00:08:09,707
- You have to go there now. / - Because... 

248
00:08:09,707 --> 00:08:11,674
The leaves are starting to fall now. 

249
00:08:11,674 --> 00:08:13,841
- He's right. / - It's beautiful right now. 

250
00:08:13,841 --> 00:08:16,407
Let's watch the trip to Danyang. 

251
00:08:19,541 --> 00:08:22,941
(He has over 300 concerts a year) 

252
00:08:23,941 --> 00:08:25,841
He debuted 46 years ago. 

253
00:08:26,574 --> 00:08:28,974
- He's amazing. / - He looks great in yellow. 

254
00:08:28,974 --> 00:08:33,107
(Tae Jinah and Kangnam) 

255
00:08:34,574 --> 00:08:36,374
Look at the green and the red. 

256
00:08:36,374 --> 00:08:39,241
(Jinah and Kangnam are the father and son of trot) 

257
00:08:40,041 --> 00:08:44,507
(Tae Jinah and Kangnam, their first trip together) 

258
00:08:44,507 --> 00:08:46,241
1, 2, 3. 

259
00:08:46,741 --> 00:08:48,807
(They already have great teamwork) 

260
00:08:49,907 --> 00:08:50,974
Father. 

261
00:08:51,241 --> 00:08:53,274
I've been there. 

262
00:08:53,274 --> 00:08:55,441
- Where? / - Battle Trip. 

263
00:08:55,441 --> 00:08:56,641
- I've been on this show. / - I see. 

264
00:08:56,641 --> 00:08:58,474
You looked thin then. 

265
00:08:58,574 --> 00:09:00,541
Yes, after a week, I gained weight again. 

266
00:09:00,541 --> 00:09:02,474
I went to Mexico. 

267
00:09:02,474 --> 00:09:04,074
- That's far away. / - It was. 

268
00:09:04,207 --> 00:09:06,107
It was incredibly fun. It was the best. 

269
00:09:06,107 --> 00:09:08,607
He's right. This trip was amazing. 

270
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:10,541
- It was really nice. / - It was so much fun. 

271
00:09:12,407 --> 00:09:15,141
I'll plan one day. You plan the other day. 

272
00:09:15,441 --> 00:09:17,841
- The itinerary? / - Yes, but if you plan it bad... 

273
00:09:18,174 --> 00:09:20,374
It'll be the planner to blame. It'll be no fun. 

274
00:09:20,374 --> 00:09:22,441
- That will trouble the show. / - I see. 

275
00:09:22,441 --> 00:09:23,874
And we will disappoint a lot of people. 

276
00:09:23,874 --> 00:09:25,007
So we have to plan well. 

277
00:09:25,007 --> 00:09:27,141
- Then you do it. / - No, we should do it together. 

278
00:09:27,141 --> 00:09:29,174
- But you've done it before. / - I have... 

279
00:09:29,174 --> 00:09:31,574
But back then, the tall guy planned almost everything. 

280
00:09:32,374 --> 00:09:33,574
So this time, you should help me. 

281
00:09:33,574 --> 00:09:35,607
Do you know any good places? 

282
00:09:36,707 --> 00:09:38,574
This week's theme is a domestic fall trip 

283
00:09:38,574 --> 00:09:40,307
with a hidden card. 

284
00:09:40,307 --> 00:09:41,074
Hidden card? 

285
00:09:42,207 --> 00:09:43,674
- Hidden card? / - Hidden card. 

286
00:09:43,674 --> 00:09:45,341
- It means a card that is hidden. / - A hidden card. 

287
00:09:45,341 --> 00:09:47,141
- A card only I can see. / - Exactly. 

288
00:09:47,141 --> 00:09:49,307
Where should we go? 

289
00:09:49,307 --> 00:09:50,307
(Recalling all the places where he had concerts) 

290
00:09:52,141 --> 00:09:55,007
I once went to... Where was it? 

291
00:09:55,374 --> 00:09:57,441
- A place called Danyang. / - Danyang. 

292
00:09:57,741 --> 00:10:00,141
- What is it famous for? / - The 8 Views of Danyang. 

293
00:10:00,707 --> 00:10:01,907
It's very famous. 

294
00:10:01,907 --> 00:10:03,407
It's a truly beautiful sight. 

295
00:10:03,407 --> 00:10:06,141
- It really is incredible. / - It's amazing. 

296
00:10:06,907 --> 00:10:08,474
- Danyeong? / - Danyang. 

297
00:10:08,474 --> 00:10:10,141
- Dang? / - Dan. 

298
00:10:12,074 --> 00:10:14,741
It's hard to learn the regional names. 

299
00:10:14,741 --> 00:10:15,841
That's right. I'm working on it. 

300
00:10:16,607 --> 00:10:17,707
I have to study more. 

301
00:10:19,107 --> 00:10:20,441
Geez, give it to me. 

302
00:10:21,707 --> 00:10:24,007
I'm doing this all the time. 

303
00:10:24,007 --> 00:10:26,341
Am I his secretary or what? 

304
00:10:26,707 --> 00:10:29,207
- Is it Dan? / - Dan. 

305
00:10:29,207 --> 00:10:30,741
- Yang. / - Yang. 

306
00:10:30,741 --> 00:10:32,707
- It came up right away. Right? / - Wow. 

307
00:10:32,707 --> 00:10:34,841
Dodamsambong, Gudambong. 

308
00:10:34,841 --> 00:10:37,541
These are all peaks. Mountain peaks. 

309
00:10:37,541 --> 00:10:38,874
What is a peak? 

310
00:10:40,074 --> 00:10:41,574
We call that a peak. 

311
00:10:41,574 --> 00:10:43,207
- That's a peak? / - Yes, it's the mountaintop. 

312
00:10:45,241 --> 00:10:46,874
- It was tiring to explain it. / - How much explanation... 

313
00:10:46,874 --> 00:10:47,941
Does he need? 

314
00:10:47,941 --> 00:10:49,841
- It's right here? / - Traveling with him will be hard. 

315
00:10:49,841 --> 00:10:51,774
There's a peak on the mountain just like this. 

316
00:10:51,774 --> 00:10:53,074
This is a peak? 

317
00:10:53,507 --> 00:10:54,174
- No, it's the mountain. / - So... 

318
00:10:54,174 --> 00:10:56,674
If this is the mountain, there is a peak here. 

319
00:10:57,007 --> 00:10:58,574
I still don't know what a peak is. 

320
00:10:58,574 --> 00:11:00,907
- "Peak" is a hard word to know. / - Exactly. 

321
00:11:00,907 --> 00:11:03,074
- Right, it's hard to explain. / - First time I heard it. 

322
00:11:03,074 --> 00:11:05,574
- Do you know what it is now? / - Now, I know. 

323
00:11:05,574 --> 00:11:06,641
It took me about 3 days. 

324
00:11:06,641 --> 00:11:09,774
- Hold on a second. / - I'm so curious to what it is. 

325
00:11:10,174 --> 00:11:12,607
- Is that a peak? / - Let me give you an example. 

326
00:11:12,607 --> 00:11:14,907
- This thing... / - This is on a mountain? 

327
00:11:15,574 --> 00:11:17,474
He said that's on top of the mountain. 

328
00:11:17,474 --> 00:11:19,574
The mountain has this kind of shape with a peak. 

329
00:11:19,574 --> 00:11:21,207
This came out of nowhere. This is it? 

330
00:11:21,207 --> 00:11:22,707
This peak would be made of stone. 

331
00:11:22,707 --> 00:11:24,541
If there are three peaks, we call it Sambong. 

332
00:11:24,607 --> 00:11:25,974
- That was part of the name earlier. / - That was. 

333
00:11:25,974 --> 00:11:27,874
- Right. / - There are three peaks in Danyang? 

334
00:11:27,874 --> 00:11:29,141
That's right. There are three peaks. 

335
00:11:29,141 --> 00:11:31,807
We have to see those peaks. I'm so curious now. 

336
00:11:31,874 --> 00:11:32,874
Let's go there. 

337
00:11:32,874 --> 00:11:35,341
I think it'd be good. There's lots to eat as well. 

338
00:11:35,341 --> 00:11:36,341
(To the mystical place with three peaks) 

339
00:11:39,941 --> 00:11:43,941
(It encloses Sobaeksanmaek and Namhangang) 

340
00:11:43,941 --> 00:11:45,807
- Look at the weather. / - I should visit Danyang. 

341
00:11:45,807 --> 00:11:48,241
- The scenery is beautiful. / - The weather was great. 

342
00:11:48,241 --> 00:11:50,074

343
00:11:50,074 --> 00:11:51,074
(It's more beautiful with fall foliage) 

344
00:11:51,074 --> 00:11:52,641
- Where is that? / - The foliage... 

345
00:11:52,641 --> 00:11:53,807
Isn't that CG? 

346
00:11:55,407 --> 00:11:59,141
(Korea's green rest area, Danyang) 

347
00:11:59,141 --> 00:12:02,207
When I went to Mexico with Taegon, 

348
00:12:02,207 --> 00:12:05,374
we named our team, Tequila Bros. 

349
00:12:05,374 --> 00:12:06,541
What should we name ours? 

350
00:12:07,441 --> 00:12:08,974
- Peak Brothers. / - What? 

351
00:12:09,374 --> 00:12:11,807
- Peak? Because it's about peaks? / - I'm curious. 

352
00:12:11,807 --> 00:12:13,207
Peak Father and Son. 

353
00:12:13,207 --> 00:12:14,207
- Let's be rich. / - We're father and son. 

354
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:16,874
- Right. / - You and I are like father and son. 

355
00:12:16,874 --> 00:12:17,741
Peak Father and Son. 

356
00:12:17,741 --> 00:12:18,907
- You know SHINHWA's slogan? / - I see. 

357
00:12:18,974 --> 00:12:21,141
We are... Peak Father and Son! 

358
00:12:25,507 --> 00:12:28,174
Hello, I'm Kangnam. 

359
00:12:28,541 --> 00:12:29,807
- You planned the trip? / - A filial trip. 

360
00:12:29,807 --> 00:12:33,307
He's like my father. That's why I'll try to think of 

361
00:12:33,307 --> 00:12:35,641
things that he will like when I'm planning the trip. 

362
00:12:35,641 --> 00:12:38,874
- He's so kind to focus on that. / - He's so nice. 

363
00:12:39,274 --> 00:12:41,407
There must be things he wants too. 

364
00:12:41,407 --> 00:12:44,074
Fall Trip Week. I didn't know this existed. 

365
00:12:44,074 --> 00:12:45,607
(It's a special week for fall trips) 

366
00:12:45,607 --> 00:12:49,007
We're going to Danyang. 

367
00:12:50,774 --> 00:12:53,741
- Garlic dishes. / - Right, it's famous for garlic. 

368
00:12:53,741 --> 00:12:55,374

369
00:12:55,374 --> 00:12:57,374

370
00:12:57,741 --> 00:13:00,574
- Wow, paragliding. / - That looks fun. 

371
00:13:01,707 --> 00:13:03,741
I have never heard of anyone 

372
00:13:03,741 --> 00:13:05,941
who would take the elders paragliding. 

373
00:13:07,107 --> 00:13:07,941
- What? / - Paragliding for the elders. 

374
00:13:07,941 --> 00:13:10,541
- He is too young to be called elder. / - That's right. 

375
00:13:10,541 --> 00:13:13,474
- Since it's Kangnam, this is new. / - It's his father. 

376
00:13:15,007 --> 00:13:17,307
Look at this place. There's this place in Danyang. 

377
00:13:18,207 --> 00:13:20,474
Isn't this nice? We can end the trip there. 

378
00:13:20,474 --> 00:13:21,841
That's pretty. 

379
00:13:21,841 --> 00:13:24,174
- We can wrap up there. / - He even thought of that. 

380
00:13:24,174 --> 00:13:25,874
Jinah can shed some tears here. 

381
00:13:29,641 --> 00:13:31,407
- Okay. / - It's like he's signing a report. 

382
00:13:31,407 --> 00:13:33,007
(He looks like a CEO signing a report) 

383
00:13:33,207 --> 00:13:35,041
- He looks like a CEO. / - He does. 

384
00:13:36,074 --> 00:13:39,374
For this trip, I have a hidden card. 

385
00:13:39,774 --> 00:13:41,774
I'm going to teach Kangnam 

386
00:13:41,774 --> 00:13:43,374
Korean history during this trip. 

387
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:45,674
I'll teach him about the 8 Views of Danyang. 

388
00:13:45,974 --> 00:13:46,974
(History) 

389
00:13:46,974 --> 00:13:47,974
(Hidden card) 

390
00:13:47,974 --> 00:13:48,974
(Trip planning) 

391
00:13:48,974 --> 00:13:50,341
(Battle) 

392
00:13:53,141 --> 00:13:54,507
(Calling someone) 

393
00:13:55,307 --> 00:13:57,141
- The hidden card? / - He's calling someone, right? 

394
00:13:58,041 --> 00:14:00,441
Hello, teacher. 

395
00:14:00,441 --> 00:14:01,741

396
00:14:02,374 --> 00:14:05,774
- Hello. My gosh, hi. / - Hi. 

397
00:14:05,774 --> 00:14:08,007
Hello, teacher. This time, I'm going to... 

398
00:14:08,007 --> 00:14:10,007
(He's calling someone to prepare the hidden card) 

399
00:14:10,007 --> 00:14:12,341
It must be someone who knows a lot of history. 

400
00:14:12,341 --> 00:14:13,574
- Really? / - I see. 

401
00:14:13,574 --> 00:14:15,574
- No, no. / - They're talking for long. 

402
00:14:15,574 --> 00:14:18,107
Thank you. I love you. 

403
00:14:18,107 --> 00:14:20,374
- He's calling him teacher. / - Teacher? 

404
00:14:20,741 --> 00:14:23,607
If I call someone teacher, it could be Song Hae. 

405
00:14:23,607 --> 00:14:25,207
There are a lot of people. 

406
00:14:25,207 --> 00:14:27,807
"Do you know how delicious this is?" 

407
00:14:27,807 --> 00:14:29,741
- It could be her. / - Lee Hyejung? 

408
00:14:29,741 --> 00:14:30,274
Yes. 

409
00:14:30,807 --> 00:14:33,874
As for food, when all is said and done... 

410
00:14:34,207 --> 00:14:36,107
Danyang is famous for garlic. 

411
00:14:36,107 --> 00:14:37,874
We'll get garlic short rib patties. 

412
00:14:38,207 --> 00:14:39,641
Goodness. 

413
00:14:39,641 --> 00:14:43,441
Next, we'll have hot and spicy Mandarin fish stew 

414
00:14:43,441 --> 00:14:46,574
which will go really well with soju. 

415
00:14:46,574 --> 00:14:47,941
We're going to eat that. 

416
00:14:47,941 --> 00:14:50,807
Kangnam ought to eat something like this. 

417
00:14:51,307 --> 00:14:54,474
(2.5 hours by bus from Seoul to Danyang) 

418
00:14:54,474 --> 00:14:55,641
2 hours and 30 minutes. 

419
00:14:56,074 --> 00:14:57,974
It takes 2 hours and 10 minutes by train. 

420
00:14:58,241 --> 00:15:01,074
We can even drive down there ourselves. 

421
00:15:01,074 --> 00:15:03,241
- It takes about 2 hours. / - It takes only 2 hours. 

422
00:15:03,241 --> 00:15:05,474
Whatever you take, it's around 2 hours. 

423
00:15:05,941 --> 00:15:07,841
- Wow, son. / - Yes. 

424
00:15:07,841 --> 00:15:09,507
- Let me tell you where we are. / - Okay. 

425
00:15:09,507 --> 00:15:12,874
Just like its name, this is the Ondal Tourist Site... 

426
00:15:13,307 --> 00:15:15,141
In Danyang, Chungcheongbuk-do. 

427
00:15:15,541 --> 00:15:17,607
- This place is huge. / - You really wore that outfit? 

428
00:15:17,607 --> 00:15:19,474
- Yes. / - Were you trying to... 

429
00:15:19,474 --> 00:15:22,074

430
00:15:22,074 --> 00:15:24,807
- We had to express foliage. / - That's why. 

431
00:15:24,807 --> 00:15:26,107
This place is huge. 

432
00:15:26,107 --> 00:15:30,274
As for this place, a lot of dramas were filmed here. 

433
00:15:30,274 --> 00:15:31,441
- Is that so? / - Yes. 

434
00:15:34,541 --> 00:15:35,541
What is this place? 

435
00:15:36,541 --> 00:15:39,841
- This place... / - This must be a set for shoots. 

436
00:15:39,841 --> 00:15:42,607

- A lot of dramas were filmed here. / - It says that... 

440

Dramas and movies were filmed on this site. 

441
00:15:52,674 --> 00:15:53,941
So many of them were shot here. 

442
00:15:53,941 --> 00:15:55,941
I guess they film most of the historical dramas here. 

443
00:15:55,941 --> 00:15:59,041
Hey, they filmed "Yeon Gaesomun" here too. 

444
00:15:59,607 --> 00:16:01,074
- Father. / - Yes? 

445
00:16:01,374 --> 00:16:02,641
Don't we have a hidden card? 

446
00:16:02,641 --> 00:16:03,674
We do have a hidden card. 

447
00:16:03,674 --> 00:16:06,541
It was so hard to invite this person. 

448
00:16:06,841 --> 00:16:09,107

- I don't know much about it either. / - Okay. 

452
00:16:17,674 --> 00:16:20,574
But this person is like a walking encyclopedia. 

453
00:16:20,574 --> 00:16:21,674
- Is that so? / - Yes. 

454
00:16:21,674 --> 00:16:24,441
We will get to meet this walking encyclopedia. 

455
00:16:24,441 --> 00:16:27,341
Our team name also means "to meet." 

456
00:16:28,207 --> 00:16:32,441
♪ Not just anyone can be a history teacher ♪ 

457

He makes it easy for us to understand.

00:17:13,741 --> 00:17:15,607
Actually, history comes across as a hard subject. 

475
00:17:15,607 --> 00:17:17,607
- But it's fun with a great teacher. / - That's right. 

476

This time, I'm going to ask you for a favor. 

483
00:17:36,974 --> 00:17:39,107
I'll try to get some time off by all means. 

484
00:17:39,107 --> 00:17:42,407
It would be an honor for me if I get to travel with you. 

485
00:17:42,407 --> 00:17:47,507
Then we'll meet in front of the Ondal Tourist Site.

General Ondal. 

493
00:18:06,574 --> 00:18:09,441
This is a beautiful place. 

494
00:18:09,441 --> 00:18:12,207
This place has deep roots in history. 

495
00:18:12,507 --> 00:18:15,874
This is where Ondal's love story began. 

496
00:18:15,874 --> 00:18:17,641
They were both of Goguryeo decent. 

497
00:18:18,041 --> 00:18:19,941
Pyeonggang was a princess. 

498
00:18:19,941 --> 00:18:23,041
At that time, Ondal was known as the local fool. 

499
00:18:23,041 --> 00:18:24,674
A fool and a princess got married? 

500
00:18:24,674 --> 00:18:27,374
Yes, that's right. That's how Ondal the fool... 

501
00:18:27,907 --> 00:18:30,641
Became a general for Goguryeo. 

502
00:18:30,641 --> 00:18:33,074
This area used to belong to Goguryeo back then. 

503
00:18:33,074 --> 00:18:35,841
- This area? / - Yes, but they lost it to Silla. 

504
00:18:36,374 --> 00:18:37,774
He was resolute to 

505
00:18:37,774 --> 00:18:40,174
win back the territory they lost to Silla. 

506
00:18:40,174 --> 00:18:42,407
He swore he wouldn't return without winning it back. 

507
00:18:42,407 --> 00:18:44,207
- He's so cool. He's not a fool. / - Right. 

508
00:18:44,207 --> 00:18:46,541
- Pyeonggang Princess fixed him. / - She taught him. 

509
00:18:46,541 --> 00:18:49,341
- That's so cool. / - That's how he came here. 

510
00:18:49,474 --> 00:18:52,341
He came here. If you look at the back, 

511
00:18:52,341 --> 00:18:53,741
you can see a mountain. 

512
00:18:54,274 --> 00:18:56,641
- If you head that way... / - The mountain. 

513
00:18:56,641 --> 00:18:59,007
- There's Ondal Fortress. / - Fortress. 

514
00:18:59,007 --> 00:19:01,174
- He built the fortress there. / - He built it there? 

515
00:19:01,174 --> 00:19:03,707
- That's how he took it back. / - They fought here? 

516
00:19:03,707 --> 00:19:05,607
You can find the historical traces here. 

517
00:19:06,274 --> 00:19:08,074
- There used to be a house there? / - That's right. 

518
00:19:08,074 --> 00:19:10,441
If you go down, you'll see Ondal Cave as well. 

519
00:19:10,441 --> 00:19:12,441
- Really? It's still there? / - Yes. 

520
00:19:12,441 --> 00:19:15,307
Even though they built a new tourist site here, 

521
00:19:15,307 --> 00:19:16,274
that cave is real? 

522
00:19:16,274 --> 00:19:18,674
Yes, Ondal Cave and Ondal Fortress 

523
00:19:18,674 --> 00:19:19,941
have always been here. 

524
00:19:19,941 --> 00:19:22,741
- They just built the site here? / - That's correct. 

525
00:19:22,741 --> 00:19:24,341
This is interesting. 

526
00:19:25,507 --> 00:19:30,341
You can find many traces of Goguryeo here. 

527
00:19:30,341 --> 00:19:32,374
Pay attention to the flags. 

528
00:19:32,374 --> 00:19:33,941
Flags? There they are. 

529
00:19:33,941 --> 00:19:36,207
- Take a close look... / - Gosh, they're pretty. 

530
00:19:36,207 --> 00:19:38,174
And observe the symbols on the flags. 

531
00:19:38,174 --> 00:19:41,707
That's called the "Samjoko." 

532
00:19:41,707 --> 00:19:43,274
- "Samjoko?" / - Yes. 

533
00:19:43,274 --> 00:19:45,841
- "Sam" means 3. / - 3. 

534
00:19:45,841 --> 00:19:47,807
"Jok" means leg. 

535
00:19:47,807 --> 00:19:50,574
- It means a 3-legged crow. / - 3. 

536
00:19:50,574 --> 00:19:51,841
(It's a legendary bird from Goguryeo) 

537
00:19:52,207 --> 00:19:54,507
The people of Goguryeo believed 

538
00:19:54,507 --> 00:19:55,607
that they were from the sky. 

539
00:19:55,607 --> 00:19:56,907
That's what they believed in. 

540
00:19:56,907 --> 00:19:59,674
I can see it from the above. 

541
00:19:59,674 --> 00:20:01,207
I can see the three-legged crow. 

542
00:20:01,207 --> 00:20:03,974
- It's more fun with explanations. / - Since... 

543
00:20:03,974 --> 00:20:06,441
- He talked well, he got me hooked. / - Right. 

544
00:20:06,441 --> 00:20:09,074
- I was so focused and it was so fun. / - This place... 

545
00:20:09,074 --> 00:20:10,707
Demonstrates a lot of traces Goguryeo. 

546
00:20:10,707 --> 00:20:12,307
That house looks amazing indeed. 

547
00:20:12,307 --> 00:20:13,841
I know, right? 

548
00:20:13,841 --> 00:20:15,274
I want to live in a house like this. 

549
00:20:15,674 --> 00:20:16,874
It's pretty with the rain. 

550
00:20:16,874 --> 00:20:17,541
There aren't that many people. 

551
00:20:17,541 --> 00:20:19,107
- Doesn't it have a sense of beauty? / - Yes. 

552
00:20:19,141 --> 00:20:21,874
- This place is beautiful indeed. / - Right? 

553
00:20:21,874 --> 00:20:23,807
- Father, can't you buy a house like this? / - What? 

554
00:20:23,807 --> 00:20:25,674
- You can buy a house like this. / - Right. 

555
00:20:26,307 --> 00:20:28,507
Personally, instead of houses like this one... 

556
00:20:28,507 --> 00:20:30,907
- Do you like apartments? / - Yes, I like apartments. 

557
00:20:32,807 --> 00:20:34,041
- But, teacher. / - Yes. 

558
00:20:34,041 --> 00:20:36,041
There's an old saying that goes like this. 

559
00:20:36,174 --> 00:20:37,974
"A full stomach should always come first." 

560
00:20:37,974 --> 00:20:38,741
Right. 

561
00:20:39,141 --> 00:20:40,507
- Are you hungry already? / - Yes, I am. 

562
00:20:40,507 --> 00:20:42,541
- We didn't walk a lot though. / - We did. 

563
00:20:42,541 --> 00:20:46,174
Walking this much is a lot for me. 

564
00:20:46,174 --> 00:20:48,807
- Yes, you should eat something. / - Of course. 

565
00:20:48,807 --> 00:20:50,841
I hope their food isn't that good. 

566
00:20:50,841 --> 00:20:51,974
But I can think of... 

567
00:20:52,341 --> 00:20:55,674
- Some great dishes in Danyang. / - Exactly. 

568
00:20:57,041 --> 00:20:59,707
(They're off to find the flavor of Danyang) 

569
00:20:59,707 --> 00:21:01,674
- Do you know a good place? / - Of course. 

570
00:21:01,674 --> 00:21:03,707
-  The Danyang rib patties... / - Yes. 

571
00:21:03,707 --> 00:21:06,441
This place is where it originated from. 

572
00:21:06,441 --> 00:21:07,874
- Really? / - Yes. 

573
00:21:07,874 --> 00:21:09,574
- Eating comes first when traveling. / - Of course. 

574
00:21:09,574 --> 00:21:11,141
Yes, you have to eat well. 

575
00:21:11,141 --> 00:21:13,241
- That's right. / - Eating is so important. 

576
00:21:13,541 --> 00:21:14,774
(Peak Father and Son Tour) 

577
00:21:14,774 --> 00:21:19,407
(Garlic short rib patty) 

578
00:21:19,841 --> 00:21:25,341
(35-minute drive from the Ondal Tourist Site) 

579
00:21:26,607 --> 00:21:28,541
Gosh, look at this place. 

580
00:21:28,541 --> 00:21:29,907
This place is really awesome. 

581
00:21:30,841 --> 00:21:32,607
We get a great view. 

582
00:21:35,274 --> 00:21:36,107
That's cheating. 

583
00:21:36,107 --> 00:21:37,441
That view is amazing. 

584
00:21:37,441 --> 00:21:38,841
We're reminded of this song... 

585
00:21:38,841 --> 00:21:40,441
When we see a great view. 

586
00:21:41,174 --> 00:21:44,974
(Singing) 

587
00:21:45,641 --> 00:21:48,807
(Dancing) 

588
00:21:48,807 --> 00:21:50,374
- I just realized something. / - What? 

589
00:21:50,374 --> 00:21:51,841
I just realized that this was a microphone. 

590
00:21:52,774 --> 00:21:54,007
(Anything he holds becomes a microphone) 

591
00:21:54,007 --> 00:21:55,774
- I just realized. / - Gosh. 

592
00:21:56,141 --> 00:21:58,574
I already ordered. 

593
00:21:58,574 --> 00:22:00,741
- What a great location. / - They'll bring out the best. 

594
00:22:00,741 --> 00:22:02,407
This place is famous, right? 

595
00:22:02,407 --> 00:22:05,874
Yes, this is the famous Danyang garlic short rib patty. 

596
00:22:05,874 --> 00:22:07,207
Garlic short rib patty. 

597
00:22:07,207 --> 00:22:08,874
This restaurant is the original. 

598
00:22:08,874 --> 00:22:10,374
You can see the grease oozing out. 

599
00:22:10,374 --> 00:22:13,407
It tastes better when it's a little burnt. 

600
00:22:13,407 --> 00:22:15,174
- This place is the original? / - Yes, the original. 

601
00:22:17,874 --> 00:22:19,241
Goodness. 

602
00:22:19,407 --> 00:22:21,341
Thank you. He just brought out garlic. 

603
00:22:21,341 --> 00:22:23,641
- He brought more garlic. / - Most of the side dishes... 

604
00:22:23,641 --> 00:22:25,607
Are made of garlic. 

605
00:22:25,607 --> 00:22:27,341
- Pickled garlic / - Mustard garlic? 

606
00:22:27,341 --> 00:22:29,907
Danyang is the best region... 

607
00:22:30,274 --> 00:22:32,507
For raising garlic because 

608
00:22:32,507 --> 00:22:35,941
it's in a limestone plateau and it has a huge... 

609
00:22:36,374 --> 00:22:40,141
Daily temperature range, so garlic grows well. 

610
00:22:40,941 --> 00:22:41,974
Here it is. 

611
00:22:41,974 --> 00:22:43,874
(Garlic short rib patty is finally here) 

612
00:22:43,874 --> 00:22:46,007
Their short rib patty isn't round. 

613
00:22:46,007 --> 00:22:47,407
- They cut it. / - It's cut. 

614
00:22:47,407 --> 00:22:49,174
They have spicy and regular flavors. 

615
00:22:49,474 --> 00:22:51,374
There's garlic in the patty. 

616
00:22:51,374 --> 00:22:53,607
They're all cut and then brought out. 

617
00:22:53,607 --> 00:22:54,941
The view is amazing, isn't it? 

618
00:22:54,941 --> 00:22:56,141
(They enjoy the view while the meat cooks) 

619
00:22:56,141 --> 00:22:58,441
Do you know what river this is? 

620
00:22:58,707 --> 00:23:00,674
- Do you know its name? / - I don't know. 

621
00:23:01,141 --> 00:23:02,741
- It's Hangang. / - The view is wonderful. 

622
00:23:02,741 --> 00:23:04,641
- Hangang? / - No way. 

623
00:23:04,641 --> 00:23:06,107
Hangang is in Seoul. 

624
00:23:06,107 --> 00:23:09,841
The Hangang in Seoul flows all the way down here. 

625
00:23:09,841 --> 00:23:11,074
This is Namhangang. 

626
00:23:12,007 --> 00:23:13,907
- Really? / - I just thought it shared a name. 

627
00:23:13,907 --> 00:23:15,307
- It's connected? / - Yes. 

628
00:23:15,307 --> 00:23:17,041
If you take a boat up the river... 

629
00:23:17,041 --> 00:23:18,707
- Can you reach Seoul? / - Yes. 

630
00:23:18,707 --> 00:23:20,374
So in Joseon Dynasty, 

631
00:23:20,374 --> 00:23:22,507
people took a boat here to Hanyang. 

632
00:23:22,807 --> 00:23:24,207
- That makes sense. / - Yes. 

633
00:23:24,207 --> 00:23:25,541
- Because there were no roads. / - That's right. 

634
00:23:25,541 --> 00:23:27,807
This short rib patty is so juicy. 

635
00:23:28,074 --> 00:23:31,141
Look at how juicy it is. 

636
00:23:31,141 --> 00:23:34,541
(The cube shaped short rib patty is very juicy) 

637
00:23:34,541 --> 00:23:36,007
- You can see the juice. / - Yes. 

638
00:23:37,374 --> 00:23:39,207
- Alright, it's all cooked. / - Is it? 

639
00:23:39,207 --> 00:23:41,007
- Thank you. / - Try it. 

640
00:23:41,007 --> 00:23:43,407
- Thank you. / - It looks delicious. 

641
00:23:44,907 --> 00:23:49,507
(Yummy) 

642
00:23:55,441 --> 00:23:57,241
- This is really good. / - Isn't it? 

643
00:23:57,241 --> 00:23:59,941
- It's so good. / - It's really delicious. 

644
00:23:59,941 --> 00:24:02,741
Because it has garlic, it doesn't taste greasy. 

645
00:24:02,741 --> 00:24:04,041
So you can't stop eating it. 

646
00:24:04,041 --> 00:24:05,874
You can taste more than just meat. 

647
00:24:08,507 --> 00:24:11,141
It has spicy and sweet flavors too. 

648
00:24:11,441 --> 00:24:13,407
The red one is spicy. 

649
00:24:13,807 --> 00:24:17,074
- The one that's not red is sweet. / - It's not spicy. 

650
00:24:17,074 --> 00:24:19,074
- That's not spicy. / - I see. It's good. 

651
00:24:19,074 --> 00:24:21,607
I like the spicy one. 

652
00:24:21,607 --> 00:24:23,274
- Really? / - Yes. 

653
00:24:23,274 --> 00:24:25,441
- I like the non-spicy one. / - Really? The sweet one? 

654
00:24:25,441 --> 00:24:26,641
I prefer the sweet flavor. 

655
00:24:26,641 --> 00:24:28,674
(They can choose the flavor they like) 

656
00:24:28,874 --> 00:24:32,474
In the old days, ribs were for commoners. 

657
00:24:32,474 --> 00:24:33,107
Really? 

658
00:24:33,107 --> 00:24:36,807
(Were ribs for commoners?) 

659
00:24:36,807 --> 00:24:40,207
In the old days, ribs were for commoners. 

660
00:24:40,207 --> 00:24:40,941
Really? 

661
00:24:40,941 --> 00:24:43,374
Rich people in the olden days... 

662
00:24:43,574 --> 00:24:45,174
Didn't think it was very graceful... 

663
00:24:46,341 --> 00:24:48,507
To gnaw the meat off a bone. 

664
00:24:48,507 --> 00:24:52,874
So they took the meat off the ribs... 

665
00:24:53,441 --> 00:24:57,241
Minced the meat... 

666
00:24:57,241 --> 00:24:59,074
And made it into a garlic patty. 

667
00:24:59,074 --> 00:25:01,041
- Short rib patty. / - They made it easy to eat. 

668
00:25:01,041 --> 00:25:02,141
That's right. 

669
00:25:02,707 --> 00:25:04,507
Is there a certain way to eat this? 

670
00:25:05,041 --> 00:25:07,707
You just eat it however you want. 

671
00:25:07,707 --> 00:25:10,107
Put a piece of meat, garlic... 

672
00:25:10,107 --> 00:25:12,441
- And yellow garlic. / - That looks good. 

673
00:25:13,341 --> 00:25:14,474
That's pickled garlic. 

674
00:25:14,641 --> 00:25:16,241
You can do so many things with garlic. 

675
00:25:16,241 --> 00:25:17,707
Put a perilla leaf over it. 

676
00:25:17,707 --> 00:25:19,607
- Do it like this. / - Like this. 

677
00:25:19,607 --> 00:25:22,041
(A wrap with meat and garlic is the best combination) 

678
00:25:22,041 --> 00:25:23,241
I see. 

679
00:25:24,607 --> 00:25:26,841
Just one please. I can eat that. 

680
00:25:27,307 --> 00:25:29,374

- It's nice to add garlic. / - It's spicy. 

685
00:25:41,207 --> 00:25:42,407
Add a clove of garlic. 

686

There's garlic in the short rib patty. 

687
00:25:45,874 --> 00:25:47,707
- That's right. / - Seriously. 

688

They minced garlic and meat together. 

689
00:25:51,774 --> 00:25:53,407
The garlic is so spicy. 

690
00:25:53,407 --> 00:25:54,507
It's in the meat but it's still spicy. 

691
00:25:54,507 --> 00:25:57,941
The spicy flavor lingers in your mouth. 

692
00:25:57,941 --> 00:26:00,741
The sweet juicy meat mixed with the spicy garlic. 

693
00:26:00,741 --> 00:26:02,007
I can't stop eating. 

694
00:26:02,541 --> 00:26:06,374
(Kangnam devours the food) 

695
00:26:06,974 --> 00:26:08,807

- It's so nice. / - That's very tranquil. 

713
00:27:06,974 --> 00:27:10,874

714
00:27:11,074 --> 00:27:12,741
It stopped raining. 

715
00:27:13,941 --> 00:27:16,341
- That's good. / - It stopped raining... 

716
00:27:16,341 --> 00:27:19,874
And the mist covered the mountain peaks.

You'll see. 

718
00:27:22,207 --> 00:27:25,807
We'll look at the 8 Views of Danyang on a cruise ship. 

719
00:27:26,241 --> 00:27:29,874
You can see the fifth and sixth views 

720
00:27:29,874 --> 00:27:32,574

- Love story. / - I like love stories. 

725

- This is part two. / - You're a great storyteller... 

728
00:27:46,407 --> 00:27:47,774

- I haven't been on dates. / - How old you are? 

731
00:27:53,374 --> 00:27:54,407

Father. 

736
00:28:02,507 --> 00:28:04,974
- Father, we're on a trip. / - I'm sorry. 

737
00:28:04,974 --> 00:28:07,241
You always fall asleep after eating. 

738
00:28:07,241 --> 00:28:08,507
I feel sleepy after eating. 

739
00:28:08,507 --> 00:28:10,574
You always sleep after you eat. 

740
00:28:11,241 --> 00:28:13,241
Let me sleep for 10 minutes. 

741
00:28:13,241 --> 00:28:15,207

- He needs a nap. / - He should sleep at night.

00:28:25,407 --> 00:28:28,141
(They arrive at the quay) 

745

- Hello. / - Hello. 

757
00:28:53,707 --> 00:28:55,041

- That looks amazing. / - It's nice. 

760
00:28:58,374 --> 00:29:01,007

764
00:29:09,907 --> 00:29:14,774
tell us about the history of the 8 Views of Danyang. 

765
00:29:14,774 --> 00:29:16,874

766
00:29:16,874 --> 00:29:20,041
- It's the 8 views of Danyang. / - Yes. 

767
00:29:20,041 --> 00:29:21,874
It looks beautiful in fall.

Wow. It'll turn orange then. 

769
00:29:23,807 --> 00:29:26,374
In fall, this place will match our jackets. 

770
00:29:26,941 --> 00:29:28,874
The leaves will turn red. 

771
00:29:29,207 --> 00:29:33,307
This place is really beautiful in fall. 

772
00:29:33,307 --> 00:29:35,174
- It's so pretty. / - That's how it looks. 

773
00:29:35,907 --> 00:29:36,907
We should've gone at this time. 

774
00:29:36,907 --> 00:29:38,807
You can see that if you go there... 

775
00:29:38,807 --> 00:29:40,174
- After watching this Battle Trip. / - It'll be... 

776
00:29:40,174 --> 00:29:42,007
Perfect to go now. 

777
00:29:42,007 --> 00:29:43,841
(Fall is the most beautiful season to enjoy the view) 

778
00:29:43,841 --> 00:29:46,374
When it's sunny, the shadow is... 

779
00:29:46,541 --> 00:29:48,141
Reflected in the lake. 

780
00:29:48,741 --> 00:29:51,841
- That must be wonderful. / - The sky and the nature... 

781
00:29:51,841 --> 00:29:53,741
Get reflected in the lake. 

782
00:29:54,674 --> 00:29:58,174
Our ancestors came here a lot too. 

783
00:29:58,174 --> 00:29:59,307
For example... 

784
00:29:59,307 --> 00:30:00,807
(Many ancestors visited this place) 

785
00:30:00,807 --> 00:30:03,341
- This person. / - What? 

786
00:30:03,341 --> 00:30:04,741
This is Yi Hwang. 

787
00:30:04,741 --> 00:30:09,374
(Toegye Yi Hwang) 

788
00:30:09,441 --> 00:30:11,374
He was a Confucian scholar. 

789
00:30:11,374 --> 00:30:13,841
- He studied a lot. / - I see. 

790
00:30:13,841 --> 00:30:15,041

- I see him often. / - Of course. 

794
00:30:20,241 --> 00:30:22,274
- Alright, look over there. / - Okay. 

795
00:30:22,274 --> 00:30:23,707
Do you see a tomb down there? 

796
00:30:24,074 --> 00:30:25,674
- Do you see it? / - Yes, there's a tomb. 

797
00:30:25,674 --> 00:30:27,307
It's the tomb... 

798
00:30:27,307 --> 00:30:29,807
Of a woman named Du Hyang. 

799
00:30:29,807 --> 00:30:31,407
- Du Hyang. / - What? Why is it there? 

800
00:30:31,407 --> 00:30:33,374
- Her name is Du Hyang. Yi Hwang... / - Why? 

801
00:30:33,374 --> 00:30:35,074
Came here as a district magistrate. Do you know it? 

802
00:30:35,074 --> 00:30:36,174
- I know what that is. / - Yes, the district magistrate. 

803
00:30:36,174 --> 00:30:40,007
Du Hyang fell in love at first sight with Yi Hwang. 

804
00:30:40,007 --> 00:30:41,474
She fell totally in love. 

805
00:30:41,474 --> 00:30:43,974
But Yi Hwang couldn't stay here for long... 

806
00:30:43,974 --> 00:30:47,407
So when he left, she gave him a present. 

807
00:30:47,774 --> 00:30:49,107
An apricot flower. Do you know what that is? 

808
00:30:49,107 --> 00:30:50,541
- What is that? / - It's a flower. 

809
00:30:50,541 --> 00:30:51,974
Yes, it's a flower. 

810
00:30:51,974 --> 00:30:54,007
When Yi Hwang was about to die... 

811
00:30:54,307 --> 00:30:56,074
His last words were... 

812
00:30:56,974 --> 00:31:00,041
"Water that apricot flower tree." 

813
00:31:01,874 --> 00:31:03,607
I just got goose bumps. 

814
00:31:03,607 --> 00:31:06,841
- Wait, Yi Hwang was a romantic? / - So beautiful. 

815
00:31:06,841 --> 00:31:08,607
That's so... I got goose bumps. 

816
00:31:08,607 --> 00:31:09,907
Is the statue of Yi Hwang 

817
00:31:09,907 --> 00:31:11,841
holding the apricot flowers? 

818
00:31:11,841 --> 00:31:13,874
Is he? That's so pretty. 

819
00:31:14,707 --> 00:31:18,141
- Water the apricot flowers from her. / - Right. 

820
00:31:18,607 --> 00:31:20,341
Then it wasn't a one-sided love. 

821
00:31:20,341 --> 00:31:24,407
- But we don't know that. / - They did love each other. 

822
00:31:24,407 --> 00:31:27,141
But he had to leave for work. 

823
00:31:27,141 --> 00:31:28,207
It wasn't a one-sided love. 

824
00:31:28,207 --> 00:31:30,074
I'll leave it up to your imagination. 

825
00:31:30,074 --> 00:31:32,341
- You can imagine that, Kangnam. / - Who says that? 

826
00:31:32,341 --> 00:31:34,407
- It's part of history. Right. / - Is it written somewhere? 

827
00:31:34,407 --> 00:31:35,807
- Then... / - That's why... 

828
00:31:35,807 --> 00:31:37,374
- What do you see on this bill? / - Apricot flower! 

829

831
00:31:43,241 --> 00:31:44,374
- Really? / - Seriously? 

832
00:31:44,374 --> 00:31:45,541
I had no idea. 

833
00:31:45,774 --> 00:31:47,774
Right? Isn't this amazing? 

834
00:31:48,307 --> 00:31:49,074
I had no idea. 

835
00:31:49,074 --> 00:31:51,674
- He's such a great teacher. / - The flowers are here. 

836
00:31:51,674 --> 00:31:53,174
- These are big apricot flowers. / - Right? 

837
00:31:53,174 --> 00:31:55,141
You can really find apricot flowers on the bill. 

838
00:31:55,674 --> 00:31:58,541
- The flowers are really pretty. / - Right. 

839
00:31:58,541 --> 00:31:59,874
I didn't know. 

840
00:31:59,874 --> 00:32:01,307
Gosh, this teacher is fun. 

841
00:32:01,307 --> 00:32:03,307
(The apricot flowers are drawn on the bill) 

842
00:32:03,307 --> 00:32:04,741
This is a touching story. 

843
00:32:05,041 --> 00:32:06,641
- I loved the story. It's touching. / - When you... 

844
00:32:06,641 --> 00:32:08,174
When you look over here, 

845
00:32:08,174 --> 00:32:10,041
you can see the 5th View of Danyang. 

846
00:32:10,607 --> 00:32:12,874
- This is called Gudambong. / - Is it that one? 

847
00:32:12,874 --> 00:32:14,141
It was so close. 

848
00:32:14,141 --> 00:32:16,774
- That's right. It's close. / - It's so close. 

849
00:32:16,774 --> 00:32:18,174
Tell you what. 

850
00:32:18,174 --> 00:32:20,941
- I felt a presence from the steps. / - Exactly. 

851
00:32:20,941 --> 00:32:22,441
- I saw that right away. / - That's right. 

852
00:32:22,441 --> 00:32:24,441
- That is Gudambong. / - Gudambong. 

853
00:32:24,441 --> 00:32:28,474
(Tomb of Du Hyang, Gudambong and Oksunbong) 

854
00:32:28,974 --> 00:32:32,141
The shape of the peak looks like a turtle 

855
00:32:32,141 --> 00:32:33,007
from bottom to top. 

856
00:32:33,541 --> 00:32:35,407
And the shape is reflected on the water. 

857
00:32:35,407 --> 00:32:37,107
You can't see it well because of the weather today. 

858
00:32:37,107 --> 00:32:39,174
On a sunny day, you can see the reflection. 

859
00:32:39,174 --> 00:32:41,007
It looks like a turtle climbing up. 

860
00:32:41,007 --> 00:32:42,241
That's where the name comes from. 

861
00:32:44,207 --> 00:32:45,674
You are one amazing teacher. 

862
00:32:46,374 --> 00:32:49,641
- There are no trees just here? / - As we go around... 

863
00:32:49,641 --> 00:32:50,807
We can see its shape better. 

864
00:32:50,807 --> 00:32:53,307
Here's the thing about the rock. 

865
00:32:53,307 --> 00:32:55,141
When you go around the rock 

866
00:32:55,141 --> 00:32:57,074
and see the rock at this angle... 

867
00:32:57,074 --> 00:32:59,807
- You can see the shape of a turtle. / - A turtle? 

868
00:32:59,807 --> 00:33:01,607
- There it is. / - That part looks like a turtle. 

869
00:33:02,007 --> 00:33:03,741
You know those rocks? 

870
00:33:04,074 --> 00:33:06,941
I've seen them a lot in China and Vietnam. 

871
00:33:06,941 --> 00:33:08,141
It's my first time seeing one in Korea. 

872
00:33:08,141 --> 00:33:12,641
There are a lot of rocky cliffs here 

873
00:33:12,641 --> 00:33:14,241
because this place is mostly made up of limestone. 

874
00:33:14,241 --> 00:33:17,274
- Many cliffs are developed here. / - I see. 

875
00:33:17,274 --> 00:33:19,707
Yi Hwang came to this place... 

876
00:33:20,174 --> 00:33:21,274
And had the same reaction. 

877
00:33:21,274 --> 00:33:24,774
- Remember the cliffs in China? / - Right. 

878
00:33:24,774 --> 00:33:27,241
He said that these were much more beautiful. 

879
00:33:29,807 --> 00:33:31,974
- He said this was magnificent. / - Like Indiana Jones. 

880
00:33:31,974 --> 00:33:33,774
- This is such a beauty. / - Right. 

881
00:33:33,774 --> 00:33:36,307
They're all rocky mountains. 

882
00:33:36,774 --> 00:33:38,107
This is amazing. 

883
00:33:41,541 --> 00:33:43,374
(As they enjoy the view, they arrive at the last stop) 

884
00:33:43,374 --> 00:33:45,674
Now, among the 8 Views... 

885
00:33:45,674 --> 00:33:47,907
- This is Oksunbong, the sixth view. / - Oksunbong. 

886
00:33:47,907 --> 00:33:49,141
Let me tell you why this is called Oksunbong. 

887
00:33:49,141 --> 00:33:50,907
- Do you know bamboo shoots? / - Yes, I do. 

888
00:33:50,907 --> 00:33:52,941
It's sticking out just like bamboo shoots. 

889
00:33:53,707 --> 00:33:55,441
- This is called Oksunbong... / - You're right. 

890
00:33:55,441 --> 00:33:58,074
Because the trees are white and dazzling. 

891
00:33:58,074 --> 00:33:59,441
With the Oksunbong, 

892
00:33:59,441 --> 00:34:01,674
it's one of the 8 views of Danyang 

893
00:34:01,674 --> 00:34:03,274
but isn't actually in Danyang. 

894
00:34:03,274 --> 00:34:04,007
- This one isn't? / - Is that so? 

895
00:34:04,007 --> 00:34:06,707
- This is included in Jecheon. / - Jecheon? 

896
00:34:06,707 --> 00:34:08,474
This is part of Jecheon. 

897
00:34:08,474 --> 00:34:09,541
Let me tell you how this happened. 

898
00:34:09,541 --> 00:34:11,241
Yi Hwang came here as a district magistrate. 

899
00:34:11,241 --> 00:34:13,207
There is this story. Du Hyang asked Yi Hwang... 

900
00:34:13,541 --> 00:34:17,107
To include Oksunbong under the area of Danyang. 

901
00:34:17,107 --> 00:34:19,407
After listening to Du Hyang, 

902
00:34:19,407 --> 00:34:21,174
Yi Hwang thought it was a good suggestion. 

903
00:34:21,174 --> 00:34:22,674
He went to the magistrate of Jecheon. 

904
00:34:23,107 --> 00:34:25,141
- You think the magistrate agreed? / - No. 

905
00:34:25,141 --> 00:34:27,007
Of course he wouldn't agree. 

906
00:34:27,007 --> 00:34:28,507
Yi Hwang came here. 

907
00:34:28,507 --> 00:34:30,341
If we go that way, we'd be in Danyang. 

908
00:34:30,341 --> 00:34:31,541
He engraved letters to let people know that 

909
00:34:31,541 --> 00:34:32,874
from this point on, it'd be Danyang. 

910
00:34:32,874 --> 00:34:35,541
- Is the sign still there? / - Now it became a dam. 

911
00:34:35,874 --> 00:34:38,774
- Is it at the bottom? / - The letters are at the bottom. 

912
00:34:38,774 --> 00:34:39,941
He did a fantastic job of writing it. 

913
00:34:40,607 --> 00:34:44,007
That's the story how it made it to the list. 

914
00:34:44,407 --> 00:34:46,374
When the tide goes out, you can see the letters. 

915
00:34:47,041 --> 00:34:48,541
- When it goes out. / - When the water goes down. 

916
00:34:49,441 --> 00:34:50,874
- What a sight. / - It's a superb view. 

917
00:34:50,874 --> 00:34:53,674
It'd be so fun to travel while learning about the history. 

918
00:34:53,674 --> 00:34:55,441
It was because the stories were connected. 

919
00:34:55,441 --> 00:34:58,707
- It's also moving. / - When you come here... 

920
00:34:58,707 --> 00:35:00,107
- You'll get to relax. / - Right. 

921
00:35:00,107 --> 00:35:01,507
You've been busy 

922
00:35:01,507 --> 00:35:03,174
but as you admire this beautiful nature... 

923
00:35:03,641 --> 00:35:06,674
You can feel as if you're part of it. 

924
00:35:06,674 --> 00:35:08,541
I hope you can enjoy this feeling. 

925
00:35:08,541 --> 00:35:10,307
- It's great. / - Isn't this great? 

926
00:35:10,307 --> 00:35:12,874
(A relaxing time to admire this beautiful nature) 

927
00:35:12,874 --> 00:35:14,607
- Alright. / - Okay. 

928
00:35:14,607 --> 00:35:16,274
- We saw a lot, didn't we? / - Yes, we did. 

929
00:35:16,274 --> 00:35:17,507
- Wasn't it beautiful? / - It was. 

930
00:35:17,507 --> 00:35:20,407
However, we still haven't seen... 

931
00:35:20,841 --> 00:35:23,541
The most beautiful place of the 8 Views. 

932
00:35:23,541 --> 00:35:25,541
- It's not here? / - No, it's not here. 

933
00:35:25,541 --> 00:35:28,507
- That will impress you even more. / - Really? 

934
00:35:28,507 --> 00:35:30,874
Let's set out to see the most beautiful view of all. 

935
00:35:30,874 --> 00:35:32,607
- Okay, let's go. / - Let's go. 

936
00:35:33,041 --> 00:35:36,141
- Where are you going? / - That's the highlight of... 

937
00:35:36,141 --> 00:35:38,407
- The 8 Views of Danyang. / - I see. 

938
00:35:38,707 --> 00:35:41,341
- He's signing again. / - Yes, that's right. 

939
00:35:41,641 --> 00:35:43,541
It was in the drama, "Jeong Dojeon." 

940
00:35:44,074 --> 00:35:49,107
Jeong Dojeon's nickname is Sambong. 

941
00:35:49,474 --> 00:35:51,641
- Dodamsambong. / - This one was beautiful. 

942
00:35:51,641 --> 00:35:53,107
- He explained that earlier. / - Dodamsambong. 

943
00:35:53,107 --> 00:35:55,841
- That's right. / - He did it with the water bottles. 

944
00:35:55,841 --> 00:35:57,341
- There's a pavilion. / - My gosh. 

945
00:35:57,341 --> 00:35:59,174
There are three peaks. Look. 

946
00:35:59,174 --> 00:36:00,641
That looks magnificent. 

947
00:36:02,407 --> 00:36:05,174
It's so picturesque. Photos would look great. 

948
00:36:05,174 --> 00:36:06,374
- Isn't this beautiful? / - Yes. 

949
00:36:06,374 --> 00:36:11,407
(30 minutes by car to Dodamsambong) 

950
00:36:13,207 --> 00:36:14,974
- This is... / - Yes? 

951
00:36:15,274 --> 00:36:16,741
Dodamsambong which 

952
00:36:16,741 --> 00:36:18,841
Danyang is the most famous for. 

953
00:36:19,207 --> 00:36:21,807
- Jeong Dojeon was a great scholar. / - Jeong Dojeon. 

954
00:36:22,074 --> 00:36:24,741
His nickname is Sambong. 

955
00:36:24,807 --> 00:36:26,774
- Isn't it? / - Yes, it is. 

956
00:36:27,141 --> 00:36:28,641
That's the extent of my knowledge. 

957
00:36:28,641 --> 00:36:31,474
- I see. / - He will explain the rest. 

958
00:36:32,074 --> 00:36:34,174
- Dodamsambong. Got it? / - Okay. 

959
00:36:34,174 --> 00:36:35,174
Dodamsambong. 

960
00:36:35,174 --> 00:36:36,641
I'm so relieved it rained. 

961
00:36:36,641 --> 00:36:38,274
It looks so pretty on a sunny day. 

962
00:36:39,307 --> 00:36:41,274
- For me, I'm very relieved. / - But... 

963
00:36:41,274 --> 00:36:42,807
Since it's raining, doesn't it look like a movie? 

964
00:36:42,807 --> 00:36:46,007
- It looks classical. / - It has that classical charm. 

965
00:36:46,007 --> 00:36:48,941
- Right? / - It's interesting. And a pavilion. 

966
00:36:49,174 --> 00:36:51,407
I love pavilions the most. That. 

967
00:36:51,407 --> 00:36:52,341
It's right there. 

968
00:36:52,341 --> 00:36:54,207
- Do you like pavilions the most? / - Yes. 

969
00:36:54,707 --> 00:36:57,374
That pavilion over there is indeed beautiful. 

970
00:36:58,141 --> 00:37:00,041
- It looks bigger up close. / - Isn't this beautiful? 

971
00:37:00,741 --> 00:37:03,341
This is the best viewpoint. 

972
00:37:03,341 --> 00:37:04,374
- This is the viewpoint? / - Yes. 

973
00:37:04,374 --> 00:37:07,841
It was chosen as 1 of 100 places to visit in Korea. 

974
00:37:08,174 --> 00:37:09,241
For 3 years in a row. 

975
00:37:09,241 --> 00:37:11,674
The most popular tourist spot in Chungcheongbuk-do. 

976
00:37:11,674 --> 00:37:13,541
This is the Dodamsambong. 

977
00:37:14,074 --> 00:37:15,607
- It is 1 of 100 places? / - Yes. 

978
00:37:16,741 --> 00:37:19,707
He was the architect of the new Joseon Dynasty. 

979
00:37:19,707 --> 00:37:21,674
- That's Jeong Dojeon. / - Jeong Dojeon. 

980
00:37:21,674 --> 00:37:23,307
I heard that Jeong Dojeon... 

981
00:37:24,841 --> 00:37:26,941
Loved Dodamsambong. 

982
00:37:26,941 --> 00:37:29,141
This is the place where you can see 

983
00:37:29,141 --> 00:37:30,074
the peaks the most clearly. 

984
00:37:30,074 --> 00:37:32,274
- Oh, yeah. That's why he's here. / - That's why... 

985
00:37:32,274 --> 00:37:35,441
They set up a statue of Jeong Dojeon 

986
00:37:35,441 --> 00:37:36,974
in this very spot. 

987
00:37:37,574 --> 00:37:42,541
(Sambong Jeong Dojeon) 

988
00:37:43,074 --> 00:37:45,074
- Have you been to Namdaemun? / - Yes, I have. 

989
00:37:45,074 --> 00:37:47,007
- I often go there. / - He named the very building. 

990
00:37:47,374 --> 00:37:48,974
- Seriously? / - Yes. 

991
00:37:49,441 --> 00:37:51,607
- He named Namdaemun? / - Yes, that's right. 

992
00:37:51,607 --> 00:37:54,374
He named Sungnyemun and Heunginjimun as well. 

993
00:37:54,674 --> 00:37:57,374
We still use those names. This is the place... 

994
00:37:57,674 --> 00:38:00,641
- Where Jeong Dojeon was born. / - I see. 

995
00:38:00,907 --> 00:38:02,874
- The story is told until this day. / - In this area? 

996
00:38:02,874 --> 00:38:04,774
Because he loved this place 

997
00:38:04,774 --> 00:38:06,674
so much since he was young... 

998
00:38:07,007 --> 00:38:09,107
- He chose his own nickname... / - His nickname? 

999
00:38:09,107 --> 00:38:11,841
To be Sambong to dedicate it to the three peaks. 

1000
00:38:11,841 --> 00:38:13,341
That's how the story goes. 

1001
00:38:13,807 --> 00:38:15,641
- Here's the second story. / - Okay. 

1002
00:38:15,941 --> 00:38:18,641
Actually, some say that these three peaks... 

1003
00:38:18,907 --> 00:38:20,374
Didn't belong here. 

1004
00:38:20,374 --> 00:38:22,074
- Really? Did they bring the peaks? / - Yes. 

1005
00:38:22,074 --> 00:38:24,141
These three peaks flowed down from Gangwon-do. 

1006
00:38:24,374 --> 00:38:26,441
The rocks moved down little by little? 

1007
00:38:26,441 --> 00:38:28,807
It floated on the water and drifted all the way here. 

1008
00:38:28,807 --> 00:38:30,307
It floated on the water? 

1009
00:38:30,307 --> 00:38:31,774
- That's the story. / - I see. It's a story. 

1010
00:38:31,774 --> 00:38:33,007
- It's a story. / - I see. 

1011
00:38:33,007 --> 00:38:34,841
The peaks floated down here. 

1012
00:38:35,207 --> 00:38:37,807
The government officials from the province came. 

1013
00:38:37,807 --> 00:38:39,641
When they came to check, they saw these peaks. 

1014
00:38:39,641 --> 00:38:42,941
They asked how they could end up here. And made... 

1015
00:38:43,141 --> 00:38:47,374
The people in Danyang pay taxes for the peaks. 

1016
00:38:48,407 --> 00:38:51,607
When this happened, a young boy who resided here... 

1017
00:38:51,941 --> 00:38:53,841
He asked why they were forced to... 

1018
00:38:53,841 --> 00:38:55,674
- Pay taxes to Gangwon-do. / - That's right! 

1019
00:38:55,674 --> 00:38:58,641
- He has a point. / - He told the officials that... 

1020
00:38:58,641 --> 00:39:00,041
The peaks didn't belong to them, 

1021
00:39:00,041 --> 00:39:01,674
so he told the officials to take them back. 

1022
00:39:01,674 --> 00:39:03,874
- But they can't. / - That's right. 

1023
00:39:04,041 --> 00:39:05,407
- "Take them with you." / - He was very smart. 

1024
00:39:05,407 --> 00:39:06,541
That's right. He told them to take the peaks. 

1025
00:39:06,541 --> 00:39:08,707
We think that this young boy 

1026
00:39:08,707 --> 00:39:11,507
must have been Sambong Jeong Dojeon. 

1027
00:39:11,874 --> 00:39:14,307
That's how they didn't have to pay taxes anymore. 

1028
00:39:14,307 --> 00:39:15,474
That's another story. 

1029
00:39:15,807 --> 00:39:16,841
The last story was so fun. 

1030
00:39:16,841 --> 00:39:17,907
- Right? / - The one with the young boy. 

1031
00:39:17,907 --> 00:39:21,474
And since you two are in front of the peaks now... 

1032
00:39:21,874 --> 00:39:25,107
I'm sure there will be a story of your visit here too. 

1033
00:39:25,107 --> 00:39:26,341
That's my humble thought. 

1034
00:39:26,341 --> 00:39:27,741
(History is a collection of moments) 

1035
00:39:27,741 --> 00:39:29,141
All the stories are connected. 

1036
00:39:29,141 --> 00:39:30,141
- That's right. / - This is so much fun. 

1037
00:39:30,141 --> 00:39:32,041
I told stories about Yi Hwang and Jeong Dojeon. 

1038
00:39:32,041 --> 00:39:33,741
This story is more interesting than Yi Hwang's story. 

1039
00:39:33,741 --> 00:39:35,907
- Right? It comes with a great view. / - Right. 

1040
00:39:36,307 --> 00:39:38,707
Here's one more dish we ought to try in Danyang. 

1041
00:39:39,774 --> 00:39:40,841
It's spicy mandarin fish stew. 

1042
00:39:41,107 --> 00:39:42,941
- Come on. / - Spicy mandarin fish stew? 

1043
00:39:42,941 --> 00:39:44,541
I love that stew. 

1044
00:39:44,707 --> 00:39:45,907
Spicy mandarin fish stew. 

1045
00:39:46,474 --> 00:39:47,641
We have to try that. 

1046
00:39:47,641 --> 00:39:48,641
It's really delicious. 

1047
00:39:48,641 --> 00:39:51,474
I didn't know you'd react like that. 

1048
00:39:53,207 --> 00:39:55,841
It's so good. Mandarin fish in Danyang is amazing. 

1049
00:39:55,841 --> 00:39:57,341
- Let's go eat spicy mandarin fish stew. / - Let's go. 

1050
00:39:57,541 --> 00:39:59,574
We ought to have the spicy mandarin fish stew. 

1051
00:39:59,874 --> 00:40:01,507
Spicy mandarin fish stew in Danyang 

1052
00:40:01,507 --> 00:40:02,707
is tastier than stew from other areas. 

1053
00:40:02,707 --> 00:40:04,474
- Is that so? / - Is there a reason for it? 

1054
00:40:04,474 --> 00:40:06,141
Because the river here is so clean. 

1055
00:40:06,141 --> 00:40:10,541
(10 minutes by car to the Mandarin Fish Street) 

1056
00:40:11,607 --> 00:40:14,107
(Darkness blankets the street in no time) 

1057
00:40:14,107 --> 00:40:15,941
There's this street. 

1058
00:40:16,174 --> 00:40:17,941
- It's Mandarin Fish Street. / - My goodness. 

1059
00:40:17,941 --> 00:40:19,907
- Really? / - There's a street for that? 

1060
00:40:19,907 --> 00:40:21,574
- Mandarin Fish Street. / - Mandarin Fish Street. 

1061
00:40:21,574 --> 00:40:24,141
It was beautiful. It's perfect for a date. 

1062
00:40:24,141 --> 00:40:27,107
This street must be the Mandarin Fish Street. 

1063
00:40:27,107 --> 00:40:28,874
- Look at that. / - There it is. 

1064
00:40:28,874 --> 00:40:30,574
- Is that a mandarin fish? / - It's a mandarin fish. 

1065
00:40:30,574 --> 00:40:32,207
You said it's red. 

1066
00:40:32,207 --> 00:40:37,841
- It has many red dots on its body. / - I see. 

1067
00:40:37,841 --> 00:40:40,207
Freshwater fish are the best. I love spicy fish stew. 

1068
00:40:40,207 --> 00:40:42,307
- Let's go eat spicy mandarin fish stew. / - Let's go. 

1069
00:40:42,307 --> 00:40:44,274
- Let's go. / - Mandarin fish is really tasty. 

1070
00:40:44,274 --> 00:40:45,574
You add the noodles, right? 

1071
00:40:45,574 --> 00:40:47,941
- We should add noodles in it. / - You know how to eat. 

1072
00:40:49,674 --> 00:40:51,274
(Spicy soup) 

1073
00:40:52,141 --> 00:40:54,174
(With a whole mandarin fish) 

1074
00:40:54,407 --> 00:40:56,874
(It's Danyang's specialty, known for its light taste) 

1075
00:40:59,107 --> 00:41:04,064
(Spicy mandarin fish stew) 

1076
00:41:04,849 --> 00:41:06,149
(Spicy soup) 

1077
00:41:07,316 --> 00:41:09,149
They put freshwater shrimps too. 

1078
00:41:09,616 --> 00:41:11,149
(A Danyang specialty with a clean taste) 

1079
00:41:11,149 --> 00:41:12,249
You have to cook this stew for a long time. 

1080
00:41:12,249 --> 00:41:13,282
I think it's been like 

1081
00:41:13,282 --> 00:41:15,949
over 10 years since I had spicy mandarin fish stew. 

1082
00:41:15,949 --> 00:41:17,982
- The fish is really tender. / - Yes. 

1083
00:41:17,982 --> 00:41:19,416
Finally, we are at... 

1084
00:41:19,416 --> 00:41:21,549
- Our last stop today. / - Spicy mandarin fish stew. 

1085
00:41:21,549 --> 00:41:22,616
It'll be so delicious. 

1086
00:41:22,616 --> 00:41:25,182
- Can I take off this jacket now? / - Take it off. 

1087
00:41:25,182 --> 00:41:27,249
- I can't pull my arms together. / - Take it off. 

1088
00:41:27,249 --> 00:41:27,949
(They're getting ready to chow down) 

1089
00:41:27,949 --> 00:41:29,316
Finally, you're taking off the jacket. 

1090
00:41:29,316 --> 00:41:30,682
Back in the days, 

1091
00:41:30,682 --> 00:41:33,482
spicy mandarin fish used to be called water pig. 

1092
00:41:33,482 --> 00:41:34,516
Water pig? 

1093
00:41:34,516 --> 00:41:35,682
- Pig? / - Yes. 

1094
00:41:35,682 --> 00:41:39,049
- Because it's like pork? / - It's pork of the sea. 

1095
00:41:39,049 --> 00:41:40,216
- Really? / - Yes. 

1096
00:41:40,216 --> 00:41:42,416
Mandarin fish live only in clean water. 

1097
00:41:42,416 --> 00:41:45,549
You'll see it soon, but it's very chewy and delicious. 

1098
00:41:46,182 --> 00:41:47,449
- Thank you. / - Hello. 

1099
00:41:47,449 --> 00:41:48,949
- Here come our side dishes. / - Hello. 

1100

00:41:53,749 --> 00:41:56,949

- It was really delicious. / - It looks so pretty. 

1109
00:42:04,849 --> 00:42:06,216
It has some sauce on it. 

1110
00:42:07,416 --> 00:42:09,249
Doribaengbaeng. 

1111
00:42:10,716 --> 00:42:12,116
It looks really delicious. 

1112
00:42:12,116 --> 00:42:14,616
You eat the fish with the vegetable. 

1113
00:42:14,616 --> 00:42:15,682
The fish are fried. 

1114
00:42:16,382 --> 00:42:18,416
- Is it fried? / - It tastes amazing. 

1115
00:42:18,416 --> 00:42:19,682
- It's really good. / - Totally flipped. 

1116
00:42:19,682 --> 00:42:21,216
If you go to Danyang, you must try it. 

1117
00:42:21,216 --> 00:42:22,416
Doribaengbaeng. 

1118
00:42:22,816 --> 00:42:24,182
It's stuck. 

1119
00:42:26,382 --> 00:42:28,116
- Is it stuck? / - Yes, it's stuck. 

1120
00:42:28,116 --> 00:42:29,549
You have to scrape it like when eating scorched rice. 

1121
00:42:29,549 --> 00:42:31,049
- It's stuck. / - Like this. 

1122
00:42:31,949 --> 00:42:34,349
- Pick the head of the fish. / - Oh, the head. 

1123
00:42:34,349 --> 00:42:35,882
The head is hard. 

1124
00:42:35,882 --> 00:42:38,416
- So like this. / - Like this? 

1125

00:42:43,449 --> 00:42:44,482
How do you like it, father? 

1129
00:42:44,482 --> 00:42:45,716
(Curious) 

1130
00:42:45,716 --> 00:42:47,049
How does it taste? 

1131
00:42:47,049 --> 00:42:48,516
How is it? 

1132
00:42:48,516 --> 00:42:49,749
(Curious) 

1133
00:42:49,749 --> 00:42:51,182
- Father. / - It's delicious. 

1134
00:42:51,182 --> 00:42:52,082

(Yum) 

1136
00:42:53,249 --> 00:42:54,816
Like this. 

1137
00:42:54,816 --> 00:42:57,216
(How 66-year-old fathers express the deliciousness) 

1138
00:42:57,982 --> 00:43:01,916
The more I chew it, the sauce spreads in my mouth. 

1139
00:43:05,082 --> 00:43:06,916
- Is it crispy? / - It's very crispy. 

1140
00:43:06,916 --> 00:43:07,882
(They're admiring the taste) 

1141
00:43:07,882 --> 00:43:09,116
You're right. 

1142
00:43:09,116 --> 00:43:10,649
This is a great restaurant. 

1143
00:43:11,482 --> 00:43:12,516
It's really delicious. 

1144
00:43:12,516 --> 00:43:14,016
- To be honest... / - Be objective. 

1145
00:43:14,016 --> 00:43:15,282
It was better than the spicy fish stew.

- Really? / - Really? 

1147
00:43:16,149 --> 00:43:17,116
This was really amazing.

- So the spicy fish stew wasn't good? / - What's in it? 

1149
00:43:18,449 --> 00:43:20,216
That was good too. 

1150
00:43:20,216 --> 00:43:22,616
But I haven't eaten something like this before. 

1151
00:43:22,616 --> 00:43:23,982
It was really delicious. 

1152
00:43:23,982 --> 00:43:25,349
- That's how it's cooked? / - Good restaurants... 

1153

00:43:26,749 --> 00:43:28,349
That's how I felt. I was touched. 

1155
00:43:28,349 --> 00:43:29,349
I wanted to keep eating it. 

1156
00:43:29,349 --> 00:43:32,216
- It's unique. / - We need that in Seoul. 

1157
00:43:32,216 --> 00:43:33,982

1158
00:43:33,982 --> 00:43:35,816

1161
00:43:39,249 --> 00:43:40,816
Eat a piece of garlic. 

1162
00:43:40,816 --> 00:43:42,749
(Gobbling down) 

1163
00:43:42,749 --> 00:43:44,349
It tastes amazing with garlic. 

1164
00:43:44,749 --> 00:43:45,749
Try it. 

1165
00:43:47,716 --> 00:43:49,582
Try some garlic with doribaengbaeng. 

1166
00:43:49,582 --> 00:43:50,416
It's good. 

1167

It's good. 

1168
00:43:51,782 --> 00:43:54,082
- It's good together. / - It's pickled garlic. 

1169
00:43:54,449 --> 00:43:56,649
You're right. It's good. 

1170
00:43:56,649 --> 00:43:58,616
This place is really good. 

1171
00:43:59,016 --> 00:44:00,482
This is like that thing. 

1172
00:44:02,149 --> 00:44:04,549
"Shirasu" in Japan. 

1173
00:44:04,549 --> 00:44:05,416
Is there such a thing? 

1174
00:44:05,416 --> 00:44:07,249
- Shishamo! / - Yes, shishamo. 

1175
00:44:07,249 --> 00:44:09,949

- I think I can eat just this. / - It's addictive. 

1180
00:44:18,582 --> 00:44:19,349
It is. 

1181
00:44:19,349 --> 00:44:22,116
There's pepper paste with vinegar on the vegetables. 

1182
00:44:22,582 --> 00:44:26,516
And there's bean sauce on the fish. 

1183
00:44:27,316 --> 00:44:28,749
Creamy bean sauce. 

1184
00:44:28,749 --> 00:44:32,282
Together with the fish, it tastes amazing in my mouth. 

1185
00:44:32,682 --> 00:44:33,582
It's like a work of art. 

1186
00:44:33,582 --> 00:44:37,782
- It's the sauce for spicy chewy noodles... / - Right. 

1187
00:44:37,782 --> 00:44:40,316
With fried fish that tastes like marinated chicken. 

1188
00:44:40,316 --> 00:44:41,616
- Wrapped together. / - No. 

1189
00:44:41,616 --> 00:44:42,082
It's not? 

1190
00:44:42,082 --> 00:44:44,182
- Not at all. / - Is it not like that? 

1191
00:44:44,182 --> 00:44:45,949
It tastes like a fancy... 

1192
00:44:46,816 --> 00:44:48,816
- Fancy? / - Fancy what? 

1193
00:44:48,816 --> 00:44:50,582
Side dish. 

1194
00:44:51,549 --> 00:44:53,082
How can I put it? 

1195
00:44:53,082 --> 00:44:54,349
I don't really remember. 

1196
00:44:54,349 --> 00:44:56,749
This is an amazing restaurant. 

1197
00:44:56,749 --> 00:44:57,982
It's your first time eating this, right? 

1198
00:44:57,982 --> 00:45:00,916
I haven't tasted something like this before 

1199
00:45:00,916 --> 00:45:02,649
but it's touching. 

1200
00:45:02,649 --> 00:45:05,482
If the food touches your heart, it's a good restaurant. 

1201
00:45:06,782 --> 00:45:11,382
(You're so touching) 

1202
00:45:11,382 --> 00:45:13,249
(Empty) 

1203
00:45:13,249 --> 00:45:15,382
- Can we get one more doribaengbaeng? / - Yes. 

1204
00:45:16,216 --> 00:45:18,249
- You eat so well. / - This is really delicious. 

1205
00:45:18,916 --> 00:45:21,082
This is the reason why Kangnam gained weight. 

1206
00:45:21,082 --> 00:45:22,049
(Doribaengbaeng is the reason he gained 5kg) 

1207
00:45:22,982 --> 00:45:23,982
Here it is again. 

1208
00:45:23,982 --> 00:45:26,982
- ♪ Bang bang bang ♪ / - ♪ Bang bang bang ♪ 

1209
00:45:26,982 --> 00:45:28,849
(Doribaengbaeng, bang, bang, bang) 

1210
00:45:31,182 --> 00:45:33,216
(This is an amazing restaurant) 

1211
00:45:33,216 --> 00:45:34,816
Spicy mandarin fish stew is supposed to be the main. 

1212
00:45:35,382 --> 00:45:37,582
It's finally here. 

1213
00:45:37,582 --> 00:45:40,216
(Even higher expectations on today's main dish) 

1214
00:45:42,116 --> 00:45:43,182
(Spicy mandarin fish stew) 

1215
00:45:43,182 --> 00:45:45,316
It smells so good. 

1216
00:45:46,716 --> 00:45:48,249
Dough flakes go well with this stew. 

1217
00:45:48,249 --> 00:45:50,082
Dough flakes... 

1218
00:45:50,082 --> 00:45:51,349
Dough flakes... 

1219
00:45:51,349 --> 00:45:52,816
It looks really delicious. 

1220
00:45:52,816 --> 00:45:53,916
I feel like some soju. 

1221
00:45:53,916 --> 00:45:55,449
(Spicy mandarin fish stew) 

1222
00:45:55,649 --> 00:45:56,849
(2 portions of spicy mandarin fish stew, $60) 

1223
00:45:56,849 --> 00:45:58,016
The soup... 

1224
00:45:59,016 --> 00:46:02,316
(You have to taste the soup first) 

1225
00:46:03,649 --> 00:46:05,449
- It has a refreshing taste. / - Refreshing? 

1226
00:46:05,449 --> 00:46:08,549
It's refreshing. It's really refreshing. 

1227
00:46:08,549 --> 00:46:12,682
The reason for that taste is the freshwater shrimp. 

1228
00:46:12,682 --> 00:46:13,716
(The freshwater shrimps makes the rich flavor) 

1229
00:46:13,716 --> 00:46:14,582
That's where it comes from. 

1230
00:46:14,582 --> 00:46:17,382
- The freshwater shrimp. / - I see. 

1231
00:46:17,382 --> 00:46:18,716
That makes it refreshing. 

1232
00:46:18,716 --> 00:46:20,982
- That's why it has a clean taste. / - Exactly. 

1233
00:46:20,982 --> 00:46:24,916
There's more soybean paste than chili pepper paste. 

1234
00:46:24,916 --> 00:46:26,882
That's great. Soybean paste. 

1235
00:46:29,216 --> 00:46:31,949
I love it. It's delicious. 

1236
00:46:33,816 --> 00:46:35,382
Try the mandarin fish. 

1237
00:46:36,549 --> 00:46:37,782
See how it tastes. 

1238
00:46:38,516 --> 00:46:41,516
- It just falls off the bone. / - I see. 

1239
00:46:41,516 --> 00:46:43,482
It's insane. It just falls apart. 

1240
00:46:43,916 --> 00:46:47,149
So when you scoop the soup, the flesh comes with it. 

1241
00:46:47,149 --> 00:46:48,816
That's the charm of spicy mandarin fish stew. 

1242
00:46:48,816 --> 00:46:51,082
- I want to cook it a bit longer. / - Are you sure? 

1243
00:46:51,082 --> 00:46:51,882
But this is a big one. 

1244
00:46:51,882 --> 00:46:53,349
I'll wait a bit more. 

1245
00:46:53,349 --> 00:46:54,416
Wow. 

1246
00:46:56,116 --> 00:46:57,316
(Surprised) 

1247
00:46:57,316 --> 00:46:59,582
(So tender) 

1248
00:46:59,582 --> 00:47:01,316
- Is it soft? It's good, right? / - The flesh is... 

1249
00:47:01,316 --> 00:47:03,116
So it's really soft. 

1250
00:47:03,116 --> 00:47:07,716
- So soft. / - Freshwater fish has a different texture. 

1251
00:47:07,716 --> 00:47:09,749
Have you tried spicy freshwater fish stew in Korea? 

1252
00:47:09,749 --> 00:47:12,149
I've tried spicy catfish stew. 

1253
00:47:12,149 --> 00:47:13,582
But this was much more tender. 

1254
00:47:13,582 --> 00:47:15,449
- It wasn't fishy? / - It wasn't fishy at all. 

1255
00:47:15,449 --> 00:47:16,916
(Just a touch makes the flesh fall apart) 

1256
00:47:16,916 --> 00:47:18,816
You can remove the bones so easily. 

1257
00:47:18,816 --> 00:47:20,182
It's good, isn't it? 

1258
00:47:20,182 --> 00:47:22,582
- This fish smells different from other fish. / - Right? 

1259
00:47:23,949 --> 00:47:24,649
Does it? 

1260
00:47:25,716 --> 00:47:27,749
I know why this is expensive now. 

1261
00:47:28,382 --> 00:47:30,182
- It melts in your mouth. / - The texture... 

1262
00:47:30,182 --> 00:47:31,982
- It's melting in your mouth, right? / - Yes. 

1263
00:47:31,982 --> 00:47:35,782

- It's good, isn't it? / - It's amazing. 

1267
00:47:42,516 --> 00:47:44,016
I love that it's spicy. 

1268
00:47:44,382 --> 00:47:46,249
Can we get some noodles here? 

1269
00:47:47,182 --> 00:47:50,349
(The soulmate of spicy fish stew) 

1270
00:47:50,716 --> 00:47:52,016

I learned about history

That's what happens when Jinah 

1356
00:50:52,449 --> 00:50:53,816
goes to a traditional market. 

1357
00:50:53,816 --> 00:50:54,716
Everything comes to a halt. 

1358

What do you think? 

1431
00:53:30,016 --> 00:53:32,082

1432
00:53:37,449 --> 00:53:37,749

00:53:45,082 --> 00:53:45,982
(Hot) 

1438
00:53:45,982 --> 00:53:47,049
The dumpling... 

1439
00:53:47,049 --> 00:53:50,049
(So hot) 

1440
00:53:50,416 --> 00:53:53,482
(It's hot) 

1441
00:53:54,249 --> 00:53:56,816
You just asked me if it's hot. 

1442
00:53:57,382 --> 00:53:58,949
I said it's hot. 

1443
00:54:01,116 --> 00:54:03,549
It's tasty but it's too hot. 

1444
00:54:04,582 --> 00:54:06,516
Dumplings taste good when they're hot. 

1445
00:54:06,516 --> 00:54:07,749
Dumplings should be hot... 

1446

- Because they are juicy when they're hot. / - Yes. 

1447

Be careful. 

1449
00:54:17,382 --> 00:54:18,982
- You're cooling it down. / - Yes. 

1450
00:54:18,982 --> 00:54:20,182
We're cooling it down. 

1451

- I bet it tastes good even when it's cold. / - Yeah. 

1452
00:54:22,782 --> 00:54:24,049
Rib patty. 

1453
00:54:24,049 --> 00:54:24,982

1454
00:54:24,982 --> 00:54:28,116
- It looks delicious. / - It was. 

1455
00:54:28,116 --> 00:54:30,982
It's a little sweet. 

1456
00:54:32,616 --> 00:54:34,716
This is good. 

1457
00:54:34,716 --> 00:54:38,116
It has a glossy coat. 

1458
00:54:39,516 --> 00:54:40,582
This is good. 

1459
00:54:42,816 --> 00:54:44,882
- It's really good. / - It's good. 

1460
00:54:45,982 --> 00:54:47,782
And this is the shrimp dumpling. 

1461
00:54:49,349 --> 00:54:50,949
It must be delicious. 

1462
00:54:50,949 --> 00:54:52,282
It's really good. 

1463
00:54:53,082 --> 00:54:54,982

00:54:54,982 --> 00:54:57,582
- It must be good. / - It looks tasty. 

1465
00:54:57,582 --> 00:54:59,416
(They have a bite each)

00:55:01,316 --> 00:55:03,449
This can't be not good. 

1467
00:55:03,449 --> 00:55:05,449
The shrimp is so good. 

1468
00:55:05,449 --> 00:55:08,316
It looks somewhat fancy with shrimp in it. 

1469
00:55:08,316 --> 00:55:09,182
- Yeah. / - Right? 

1470
00:55:09,182 --> 00:55:10,349
And I like the texture. 

1471
00:55:11,149 --> 00:55:13,216
And it's a little... 

1472
00:55:14,316 --> 00:55:17,216
I like the scent and texture of shrimp. 

1473
00:55:17,216 --> 00:55:21,216
Ma'am, the dumpling has the whole shrimp in it. 

1474
00:55:22,716 --> 00:55:23,816
Look at that sweet shrimp. 

1475
00:55:23,816 --> 00:55:26,582
- It has the whole shrimp in it. / - A whole one. 

1476
00:55:26,582 --> 00:55:28,449
It's not that it just has shrimp at the end. 

1477
00:55:28,449 --> 00:55:31,849
- They put stuffing on the shrimp and roll it. / - Yes. 

1478
00:55:33,182 --> 00:55:34,482
Which one did you like the most? 

1479
00:55:34,482 --> 00:55:35,982
Me? I liked the shrimp the most. 

1480
00:55:35,982 --> 00:55:37,416
- The shrimp dumpling. / - I knew it. 

1481
00:55:37,416 --> 00:55:39,982
Because of its texture. 

1482
00:55:39,982 --> 00:55:42,882
The texture makes it so good. 

1483
00:55:42,882 --> 00:55:46,282
I should go pack some shrimp garlic dumplings. 

1484
00:55:46,282 --> 00:55:50,349
Father, this place is famous for stuffed pancake. 

1485
00:55:50,349 --> 00:55:51,716
It's black garlic stuffed pancake. 

1486
00:55:51,716 --> 00:55:53,516
- Really? / - Isn't it fascinating? 

1487
00:55:53,616 --> 00:55:54,549
(Stuffed pancake with garlic in it?) 

1488
00:55:54,549 --> 00:55:56,182
It's black garlic stuffed pancake. 

1489
00:55:56,182 --> 00:55:58,349
It's stuffed with garlic? 

1490
00:55:58,349 --> 00:55:59,549
Or is it in the batter? 

1491
00:56:00,282 --> 00:56:01,782
Look at the color of it. 

1492
00:56:02,082 --> 00:56:03,582
It's black. It's pretty. 

1493
00:56:03,582 --> 00:56:05,182
(The batter is darker than normal stuffed pancake) 

1494
00:56:05,182 --> 00:56:06,416
- I'm so excited. / - Yes. 

1495
00:56:06,416 --> 00:56:08,149
They make a dish with it. 

1496
00:56:08,516 --> 00:56:09,649
(The black garlic stuffed pancakes are served) 

1497
00:56:09,649 --> 00:56:11,916
- What is that? Cheese? / - Yes, this one is cheese. 

1498
00:56:11,916 --> 00:56:13,616
This is the original. 

1499
00:56:13,616 --> 00:56:16,216
- Is this... / - Excuse me. 

1500
00:56:16,216 --> 00:56:19,649
We ordered stuffed pancake not a salad. 

1501
00:56:19,649 --> 00:56:21,249
This is a salad. 

1502
00:56:21,249 --> 00:56:22,149
Salad? 

1503
00:56:23,316 --> 00:56:25,849
(A round ordinary pancake) 

1504
00:56:28,882 --> 00:56:30,616
They cut it into small pieces? 

1505
00:56:30,616 --> 00:56:31,249
What is that? 

1506
00:56:31,249 --> 00:56:33,082
- They cut it like that? / - They cut it. 

1507
00:56:33,082 --> 00:56:34,316
Then... 

1508
00:56:34,316 --> 00:56:37,249
And they serve it like a salad. 

1509
00:56:38,116 --> 00:56:40,849
- It has onions on it. / - And cheese. 

1510
00:56:40,849 --> 00:56:43,482
- They add cheese like pizza. / - Torch? 

1511
00:56:43,482 --> 00:56:45,016
- Yes. / - It's like a meal. 

1512
00:56:45,016 --> 00:56:46,416
It's stuffed pancake pizza. 

1513
00:56:46,416 --> 00:56:49,682
- Curious, right? / - It's sweet and salty. 

1514
00:56:49,682 --> 00:56:50,949
It's the best sweet and salty dish. 

1515
00:56:51,849 --> 00:56:55,149
It looks delicious, but I'm worried about the calories. 

1516
00:56:55,149 --> 00:56:57,282
That's why Kangnam's so fat now. 

1517
00:56:57,282 --> 00:56:59,016
(He keeps teasing Kangnam) 

1518
00:56:59,849 --> 00:57:03,582
(Original pancake, $2.50, cheese pancake, $4) 

1519
00:57:04,216 --> 00:57:07,582
It has black garlic on top. 

1520
00:57:07,582 --> 00:57:10,282
- The black pieces are garlic. / - That's right. 

1521
00:57:10,282 --> 00:57:12,482
You can eat all the garlic you want in Danyang. 

1522
00:57:12,482 --> 00:57:13,482
It must be good for your body. 

1523
00:57:13,482 --> 00:57:15,582
(The spicy sauce is the highlight) 

1524
00:57:17,682 --> 00:57:19,882
(Don't be surprised if you can't see the pancake) 

1525
00:57:19,882 --> 00:57:21,916
This is very unique. 

1526
00:57:22,416 --> 00:57:24,149
I'm so curious about the taste. 

1527
00:57:24,482 --> 00:57:27,282
- We should mix the onion, cheese... / - Cheese. 

1528
00:57:27,282 --> 00:57:30,516
- And black garlic together? / - Yes. 

1529
00:57:30,516 --> 00:57:32,449
To be honest, 

1530
00:57:32,449 --> 00:57:35,582
I wanted to have a round stuffed pancake. 

1531
00:57:35,582 --> 00:57:38,949
I didn't want to have a salad. 

1532
00:57:39,216 --> 00:57:42,616
Stuffed pancakes should be eaten while walking around. 

1533
00:57:42,616 --> 00:57:44,249
I'm sorry. I didn't know that. 

1534
00:57:44,249 --> 00:57:47,182
I didn't know you liked a round stuffed pancake. 

1535
00:57:49,382 --> 00:57:50,549
He's cute. 

1536
00:57:50,549 --> 00:57:52,216
It's not about being round. 

1537
00:57:52,216 --> 00:57:53,982
- That's not the point? / - No. 

1538
00:57:53,982 --> 00:57:56,482
You don't have to eat it. I'll eat it all. 

1539
00:57:56,682 --> 00:57:58,416
You don't have to eat it. I'll eat it all. 

1540
00:57:58,416 --> 00:58:01,882
- I should try it though. / - I'll buy one in Seoul. 

1541
00:58:01,882 --> 00:58:03,449
- I should try. / - No, I'm serious. 

1542
00:58:03,449 --> 00:58:05,316
- You don't have to do that. / - Still, I should... 

1543
00:58:05,316 --> 00:58:07,382
You don't have to do that for me. 

1544
00:58:07,382 --> 00:58:09,816
- I'm curious. / - No. Please, I'm serious. 

1545
00:58:09,816 --> 00:58:11,616
- I can try though. / - No. Stop. 

1546
00:58:12,049 --> 00:58:13,916
- Why? / - Because it's tough for you. 

1547
00:58:13,916 --> 00:58:15,782
You don't have to eat something you don't like. 

1548
00:58:15,782 --> 00:58:19,116
I know it's for a TV show but you don't have to do it. 

1549
00:58:19,116 --> 00:58:20,182
You're the best singer. 

1550
00:58:20,749 --> 00:58:22,116
Just give me that. 

1551
00:58:22,116 --> 00:58:23,449
- Give it to me. / - No, then... 

1552
00:58:23,449 --> 00:58:26,316
- No, no, no. I'll do it alone. / - I'll try it. 

1553
00:58:26,316 --> 00:58:28,649
- You want to try it? / - No. I'm just... 

1554
00:58:28,649 --> 00:58:30,582
- Do you want to eat it or not? / - I want to eat it. 

1555
00:58:30,582 --> 00:58:31,549
Right? 

1556
00:58:31,982 --> 00:58:32,649
Right? 

1557
00:58:32,649 --> 00:58:35,449
(Kangnam knows how to tease him) 

1558
00:58:37,382 --> 00:58:40,082
- He's amazing. / - What a tough cookie. 

1559
00:58:40,082 --> 00:58:42,216
I knew it. You should've said that in the first place. 

1560
00:58:42,216 --> 00:58:45,282
This is my first time to try something like this. 

1561
00:58:45,282 --> 00:58:47,149
You should try it. 

1562
00:58:48,182 --> 00:58:52,249
(He tries the new stuffed pancake) 

1563
00:58:52,249 --> 00:58:54,882
I'm curious though. It must have that chewiness... 

1564
00:58:54,882 --> 00:58:56,616
That's important. 

1565
00:58:56,616 --> 00:58:58,649
It tastes like a salad with rice cake, right? 

1566
00:58:58,649 --> 00:58:59,849
A salad with rice cake. 

1567
00:58:59,849 --> 00:59:02,416
The sauce has a strong taste. 

1568
00:59:02,416 --> 00:59:06,249
This is amazing because of the honey in the pancake. 

1569
00:59:06,249 --> 00:59:08,382
The honey goes well with the sauce. 

1570
00:59:08,382 --> 00:59:09,782
The sauce and honey go well. 

1571
00:59:09,782 --> 00:59:13,016
It really looks like pizza. It looks like olives are on top. 

1572
00:59:13,016 --> 00:59:14,016
(Perfect combo of sweet and salty) 

1573
00:59:14,016 --> 00:59:15,249
But it looks unfamiliar. 

1574
00:59:15,249 --> 00:59:17,249
We only saw round stuffed pancakes... 

1575
00:59:17,249 --> 00:59:19,516
- With dripping honey. / - That's right. 

1576
00:59:21,316 --> 00:59:23,216
It has an interesting taste. 

1577
00:59:23,216 --> 00:59:24,716
- It's charming. / - Yes, it's charming. 

1578
00:59:24,716 --> 00:59:26,449
I'm curious about the cheese taste. 

1579
00:59:26,916 --> 00:59:30,016
It's spicy stuffed pancake, isn't it? 

1580
00:59:30,016 --> 00:59:33,282
Cheese went well with it, better than I thought. 

1581
00:59:33,282 --> 00:59:35,782
(The cheese stretches) 

1582
00:59:36,816 --> 00:59:37,549
Just like natto. 

1583
00:59:37,549 --> 00:59:42,382
(He rolls the cheese and takes a bite) 

1584
00:59:42,382 --> 00:59:45,182
- It's good that it's not a predictable snack. / - Right. 

1585
00:59:49,149 --> 00:59:50,182
This is good. 

1586
00:59:50,482 --> 00:59:52,416
(Yum) 

1587
00:59:52,416 --> 00:59:53,949
- This is good. / - Yes. 

1588
00:59:54,382 --> 00:59:56,916
- This is good. / - It's like pizza. 

1589
00:59:57,449 --> 00:59:59,982
The youngsters will like this. 

1590
00:59:59,982 --> 01:00:02,282
- Kids would love it. / - Exactly. 

1591
01:00:02,282 --> 01:00:04,916
I think college students will too. 

1592
01:00:04,916 --> 01:00:06,916
- Let's check this out. / - Should we try it? 

1593
01:00:06,916 --> 01:00:09,749
- I'm curious about this one. / - What is that? 

1594
01:00:11,782 --> 01:00:12,582
This is... 

1595
01:00:13,416 --> 01:00:16,016
- Have a taste. / - Scorched rice? 

1596
01:00:16,316 --> 01:00:17,949
It's black garlic scorched rice. 

1597
01:00:17,949 --> 01:00:19,482
It's scorched rice that has black garlic in it. 

1598
01:00:20,416 --> 01:00:22,616
They have black garlic in the middle. 

1599
01:00:22,616 --> 01:00:25,249
They press it with a machine. 

1600
01:00:25,249 --> 01:00:26,116
They squish it. 

1601
01:00:26,116 --> 01:00:27,616
Then what happens? 

1602
01:00:28,216 --> 01:00:30,782
- Then it becomes one. / - Scorched rice. 

1603
01:00:30,782 --> 01:00:33,949
- Is it a machine that makes scorched rice? / - Yes. 

1604
01:00:33,949 --> 01:00:34,982
Really? 

1605
01:00:34,982 --> 01:00:37,282
They press it hard and make it like crackers. 

1606
01:00:37,882 --> 01:00:38,749
This is... 

1607
01:00:39,582 --> 01:00:43,116
They must mix it with sweet and spicy chicken. 

1608
01:00:43,116 --> 01:00:46,249
They put it on top of the chicken. 

1609
01:00:46,249 --> 01:00:47,549
Really? 

1610
01:00:47,549 --> 01:00:49,416
I heard people line up for that. 

1611
01:00:49,916 --> 01:00:52,316
- That looks good. / - That looks good. 

1612
01:00:52,316 --> 01:00:56,649

1613

(Scorched rice sweet and spicy chicken) 

1615

Eat the scorched rice first. 

1616
01:01:08,716 --> 01:01:11,116
- Then the chicken once it cools. / - Got it. 

1617
01:01:11,116 --> 01:01:13,349
(Black garlic scorched rice chicken, $18) 

1618
01:01:15,016 --> 01:01:17,316
- He told us to eat the scorched rice first. / - Yes. 

1619
01:01:18,782 --> 01:01:21,416
(What does the scorched rice chicken taste like?) 

1620
01:01:21,416 --> 01:01:23,582
It's good. 

1621
01:01:23,582 --> 01:01:28,516
You can really smell the garlic in the scorched rice. 

1622
01:01:28,516 --> 01:01:34,049
You can also taste the savory scorched rice. 

1623
01:01:34,049 --> 01:01:35,849
It goes well with the scorched rice. 

1624
01:01:36,249 --> 01:01:39,916
The chicken is similar to the scorched rice. 

1625
01:01:40,516 --> 01:01:44,249
- I think the texture will be interesting. / - That's it! 

1626
01:01:44,249 --> 01:01:46,982
Looks like Shim Hyunbo is on our side. 

1627

He eats so deliciously. He eats it so well. 

1628

(The ultimate crispy dish) 

1629
01:01:55,082 --> 01:01:56,916
This is really interesting. 

1630
01:01:56,916 --> 01:01:59,116
- I can't stop eating. / - How did they think of this? 

1631
01:01:59,116 --> 01:02:02,049
- I can't stop. / - The scorched rice... 

1632
01:02:02,049 --> 01:02:03,882
Makes it unstoppable. 

1633
01:02:03,882 --> 01:02:05,249
(The scorched rice is the cherry on top) 

1634
01:02:05,249 --> 01:02:07,382
It'd be good just to eat the scorched rice. 

1635
01:02:07,382 --> 01:02:10,049
Is it possible to eat that without beer? 

1636
01:02:10,682 --> 01:02:13,116
It will be really good if you eat it with beer. 

1637
01:02:13,116 --> 01:02:14,282
Cold beer. 

1638
01:02:14,282 --> 01:02:17,116
- Cheonsik, aren't you being too absorbed? / - No. 

1639
01:02:17,116 --> 01:02:18,716
What do you mean no? 

1640
01:02:18,716 --> 01:02:20,582
I know Cheonsik well.

We saw it while riding a boat and walking, right? 

1646
01:02:35,549 --> 01:02:37,349
We will see those from the top today. 

1647
01:02:38,116 --> 01:02:41,649
Not from the bottom. We'll see it from the top. 

1648
01:02:41,649 --> 01:02:42,782
Are we going to ride an airplane? 

1649
01:02:43,416 --> 01:02:44,649
Will we ride a helicopter? 

1650
01:02:44,649 --> 01:02:46,082
- We won't ride an airplane. / - Helicopter? 

1651
01:02:46,082 --> 01:02:46,882
No.

Filial paragliding.

It really comes to mind when you think of Danyang. 

1661

- Did Jinah really try paragliding? / - That can't be. 

1662

1693
01:04:22,749 --> 01:04:24,482
- If it rains... / - I've been there. 

1694
01:04:24,482 --> 01:04:27,382
When you lie there before your jump on a sunny day... 

1695
01:04:27,382 --> 01:04:28,449
Really? 

1696
01:04:28,449 --> 01:04:29,882
It feels like you're floating in the sky.

(The paragliding site) 

1698
01:04:30,949 --> 01:04:33,716
Do you fly from here? 

1699
01:04:33,716 --> 01:04:36,416
- You do, from here. / - Really? 

1700
01:04:37,349 --> 01:04:38,916
(Will we paraglide here when it's so foggy?) 

1701
01:04:38,916 --> 01:04:43,182
Actually, this place is really famous. 

1702
01:04:43,182 --> 01:04:45,682
You can glide 60 days per year on average in Korea. 

1703
01:04:45,682 --> 01:04:49,516
But here, you can glide 300 days out of the 365. 

1704
01:04:49,516 --> 01:04:50,449
- Virtually. / - Why? 

1705
01:04:50,449 --> 01:04:53,249
Because the weather here is perfect for paragliding. 

1706
01:04:54,182 --> 01:04:56,516
But the weather's really bad because you're here. 

1707
01:04:56,516 --> 01:05:01,882
It's good weather for 300 days, only 65 are bad. 

1708
01:05:01,882 --> 01:05:04,216
But we came on one of those bad days. 

1709
01:05:04,216 --> 01:05:05,749
- We came on one of the 65 days. / - Yes. 

1710
01:05:05,749 --> 01:05:07,482
Isn't that actually amazing? 

1711
01:05:07,482 --> 01:05:10,282
- Then... That's so... / - It's virtually impossible. 

1712
01:05:10,282 --> 01:05:13,316
- I wanted to watch him paraglide. / - What a shame. 

1713
01:05:13,316 --> 01:05:14,382
- Jinah should've paraglided. / - What a shame. 

1714
01:05:14,382 --> 01:05:16,416
You can do it under most conditions here. 

1715
01:05:16,416 --> 01:05:19,049
Even if I'm acrophobic, 

1716
01:05:19,049 --> 01:05:21,582
I wanted to try it for Battle Trip. 

1717
01:05:21,582 --> 01:05:23,149
- Come on. / - I mean it. 

1718
01:05:24,716 --> 01:05:27,249
He's smiling as he says that. 

1719
01:05:27,816 --> 01:05:28,849
Do you think you would've tried it 

1720
01:05:28,849 --> 01:05:30,382
if the weather was good? 

1721
01:05:30,382 --> 01:05:32,582
I think it would have been too hard for me. 

1722
01:05:34,216 --> 01:05:37,249
- It's such a pity. / - Come on. 

1723
01:05:37,516 --> 01:05:39,182
I really wanted to show my son. 

1724
01:05:39,182 --> 01:05:40,616
You almost got angry at me. 

1725
01:05:40,616 --> 01:05:42,682
No, I really would have tried it. 

1726
01:05:42,682 --> 01:05:45,582
The weather might get better in the afternoon. 

1727
01:05:45,582 --> 01:05:47,816
- Try again in the afternoon. / - You just have to wait. 

1728
01:05:47,816 --> 01:05:49,382
- It's not over yet. / - No. 

1729
01:05:49,949 --> 01:05:51,449
He's not smiling again. 

1730
01:05:51,449 --> 01:05:54,649
Do you mean that we could do it if it doesn't rain? 

1731
01:05:54,649 --> 01:05:56,082
I want to do it with you. 

1732
01:05:56,082 --> 01:05:59,849
Sure. Since we're here, let's do it. 

1733
01:05:59,849 --> 01:06:02,549
You know for sure that it won't stop raining? 

1734
01:06:03,249 --> 01:06:05,449
- That's such a pity. / - Yeah. 

1735
01:06:05,449 --> 01:06:08,049
- But there was a cafe here. / - But we waited. 

1736
01:06:08,049 --> 01:06:10,682
- Really? / - We waited for the rain to stop. 

1737
01:06:10,682 --> 01:06:13,116
- Let's wait for a little bit. / - Alright. 

1738
01:06:13,116 --> 01:06:16,082
- If it doesn't stop, let's go somewhere else. / - Okay. 

1739
01:06:16,582 --> 01:06:19,116
I think the rain stopped a little bit. 

1740
01:06:20,349 --> 01:06:22,282
Doesn't the weather make it 

1741
01:06:22,282 --> 01:06:25,149
look like we're on the ground floor? 

1742
01:06:25,149 --> 01:06:29,349
You can't paraglide with the fog... 

1743
01:06:29,349 --> 01:06:32,082
- Since you can't see anything. / - In good weather... 

1744
01:06:32,082 --> 01:06:34,549
This is what happens. 

1745
01:06:34,549 --> 01:06:35,582
You just jump from here. 

1746
01:06:35,582 --> 01:06:38,882
You sit here and wait, then jump off from here. 

1747
01:06:39,882 --> 01:06:41,249
Isn't it amazing? 

1748
01:06:41,249 --> 01:06:42,982
That's what we should've done. 

1749
01:06:42,982 --> 01:06:43,982
That's how it looks. 

1750
01:06:43,982 --> 01:06:45,616
- You can see all of the view. / - Yes. 

1751
01:06:46,449 --> 01:06:50,216
This is what's supposed to happen. We're so unlucky. 

1752
01:06:50,216 --> 01:06:53,616
You have a driver in the back. 

1753
01:06:53,916 --> 01:06:55,316
- Driver? / - You get on with the driver. 

1754
01:06:55,316 --> 01:06:58,182
- The driver does everything. / - The driver... 

1755
01:06:58,182 --> 01:07:00,582
You say start and he starts the meter. 

1756
01:07:02,582 --> 01:07:03,516
Anyway... 

1757
01:07:04,082 --> 01:07:05,316
We can't do it today.

We should eat something he likes.

1866
01:11:14,749 --> 01:11:15,449
(He smiles) 

1867
01:11:15,449 --> 01:11:17,116

There's a scent of dried pollack. 

1875
01:11:35,882 --> 01:11:38,849
The more you eat it, the more flavorful it is. 

1876
01:11:38,849 --> 01:11:39,582
Right? 

1877
01:11:40,282 --> 01:11:42,416

The texture is amazing. 

1894
01:12:21,782 --> 01:12:23,816
It's like crackers. 

1895
01:12:24,116 --> 01:12:25,282
(He's displeased) 

1896
01:12:25,282 --> 01:12:27,249
Why do you always talk about crackers? 

1897
01:12:28,849 --> 01:12:30,149
Isn't the texture similar? 

1898

It's become something different. 

1909
01:13:02,649 --> 01:13:05,249
You need Korean lettuce kimchi for this. 

1910

The Korean lettuce kimchi. 

1911
01:13:07,082 --> 01:13:08,616

I honestly felt like I wanted to go there. 

1982
01:15:58,282 --> 01:15:59,949
I liked the food and everything 

1983
01:15:59,949 --> 01:16:02,682
but if they had gone paragliding, 

1984
01:16:02,682 --> 01:16:04,149
I would have gone there. 

1985
01:16:04,149 --> 01:16:06,616
I want to see the mandarin fish statue. 

1986
01:16:06,616 --> 01:16:09,349
- The big mandarin fish. / - I've never seen it. 

1987
01:16:09,349 --> 01:16:10,782
I've never seen a fish statue before. 

1988
01:16:10,782 --> 01:16:13,649
You should see the fish statue and eat the fish stew. 

1989
01:16:13,649 --> 01:16:15,616
- Also the garlic liquor. / - The garlic liquor. 

1990

1992
01:16:18,782 --> 01:16:21,216
- The bang bang dish. / - Doribaengbaeng. 

1993
01:16:21,216 --> 01:16:22,249
I still think about it. 

1994
01:16:22,249 --> 01:16:25,016
- Simply put, it's smelt. / - Yes, smelt. 

1995
01:16:25,016 --> 01:16:28,816
- Smelt only lives in really clean water. / - Right. 

1996
01:16:28,816 --> 01:16:30,649
They only live in such environment. 

1997
01:16:30,649 --> 01:16:35,649
- The doribaengbaeng of Danyang. / - Bang bang. 

1998
01:16:35,649 --> 01:16:37,282
Jinah, was the doribaengbaeng your favorite too? 

1999
01:16:37,282 --> 01:16:38,916
The doribaengbaeng was good too 

2000
01:16:38,916 --> 01:16:42,982
but the short rib patty is really the best in Danyang. 

2001
01:16:42,982 --> 01:16:43,549
Alright. 

2002
01:16:43,549 --> 01:16:45,882
Because of Choi Taeseong, 

2003
01:16:45,882 --> 01:16:49,282
we learned so much about Danyang. 

2004
01:16:49,282 --> 01:16:52,082
It felt plentiful after hearing the history. 

2005
01:16:52,082 --> 01:16:53,249
Right. 

2006
01:16:53,616 --> 01:16:54,916
- Now... / - Let's talk about the expenses. 

2007
01:16:54,916 --> 01:16:56,649
I'm a little worried about the expenses. 

2008
01:16:56,649 --> 01:16:58,282
- The cruise ship. / - Excluding transportation. 

2009
01:16:58,282 --> 01:17:00,616
Let's find out how much they spent. 

2010
01:17:00,616 --> 01:17:05,416
The total amount that we spent was $167. 

2011
01:17:05,416 --> 01:17:07,282
- $167? / - Per person. 

2012
01:17:07,282 --> 01:17:08,682
- Per person? / - Including accommodation? 

2013
01:17:08,682 --> 01:17:09,916
Yes. 

2014
01:17:09,916 --> 01:17:10,716
That's cheaper than I thought. 

2015
01:17:10,716 --> 01:17:12,582
They needed to do the paragliding. 

2016
01:17:12,582 --> 01:17:14,916
- Right. / - Then it'd be over $200. 

2017
01:17:14,916 --> 01:17:16,716
It could've been over $300. 

2018
01:17:16,716 --> 01:17:19,882
- Let's vote now. / - Let's vote. 

2019
01:17:19,882 --> 01:17:21,682

2020
01:17:21,682 --> 01:17:24,349
to Danyang, Chungcheongbuk-do?

(What will the judges choose?) 

2024
01:17:34,749 --> 01:17:38,349
Next week, we'll go to Korea's representative port city.
