1
00:00:00,009 --> 00:00:01,709
This really is a city of water. 

2
00:00:01,709 --> 00:00:02,409
This is amazing. 

3
00:00:02,409 --> 00:00:04,442
I feel like I'm falling deeper in love. 

4
00:00:04,442 --> 00:00:05,976
I was doing well with my diet... 

5
00:00:05,976 --> 00:00:09,609
You have to drizzle the olive oil like this. 

6
00:00:09,609 --> 00:00:11,942
(Ecstatic dishes of Venice) 

7
00:00:11,942 --> 00:00:13,009
I can't stop eating. 

8
00:00:13,009 --> 00:00:14,542
I seriously love this. 

9
00:00:14,842 --> 00:00:16,576
This is nice. I'm just happy right now. 

10
00:00:16,576 --> 00:00:18,476
Spain will lose to us. 

11
00:00:18,476 --> 00:00:19,942
Hello, Barcelona! 

12
00:00:21,342 --> 00:00:24,609
It's like all the delicious flavors put together. 

13
00:00:24,609 --> 00:00:25,676
I just got goose bumps. 

14
00:00:26,109 --> 00:00:28,076
This place is just insane. 

15
00:00:28,076 --> 00:00:29,642
It's heaven! 

16
00:00:29,642 --> 00:00:31,109
Adios! 

17
00:00:32,342 --> 00:00:34,576
(Barcelona won the first battle) 

18
00:00:34,576 --> 00:00:36,876
(Which team will win?) 

19
00:00:37,876 --> 00:00:39,409
Gourmet trip is also war. 

20
00:00:39,409 --> 00:00:41,642
Battle Trip! 

21
00:00:44,209 --> 00:00:45,309
(Lee Hwijae, Lee Wonil) 

22
00:00:46,342 --> 00:00:49,609
You look depressed, Sikyung. 

23
00:00:51,742 --> 00:00:54,076
Well, we just had the first match 

24
00:00:54,076 --> 00:00:56,742
between Venice and Barcelona 

25
00:00:56,742 --> 00:00:57,976
for the past 2 weeks. 

26
00:00:57,976 --> 00:00:59,842
And Barcelona in Spain won. 

27
00:00:59,842 --> 00:01:01,042
Yes, that's right. 

28
00:01:01,042 --> 00:01:03,042
- I think it was a cheap victory. / - Why? 

29
00:01:03,042 --> 00:01:04,476
Why do you think it's cheap? 

30
00:01:04,476 --> 00:01:07,909
For today, we've prepared something special. 

31
00:01:09,009 --> 00:01:11,509
We would love that. 

32
00:01:11,509 --> 00:01:13,142
We can't win this match... 

33
00:01:13,909 --> 00:01:15,376
Only with a video. 

34
00:01:15,376 --> 00:01:17,342
We don't want to lose again, 

35
00:01:17,342 --> 00:01:19,142
so we prepared something. 

36
00:01:19,142 --> 00:01:21,509
Where are we going this week? 

37
00:01:21,942 --> 00:01:23,942
It might sound unfamiliar. 

38
00:01:23,942 --> 00:01:26,042
It's the origin of ragu pasta... 

39
00:01:26,476 --> 00:01:28,809
The gourmet city and the city of gluttony. 

40
00:01:29,776 --> 00:01:30,976
Yes, it's Bologna. 

41
00:01:30,976 --> 00:01:32,209
- Bologna. / - We will... 

42
00:01:32,209 --> 00:01:33,642
- Show you. / - Okay. 

43
00:01:33,642 --> 00:01:36,776
Bologna is in Northern Italy. 

44
00:01:36,776 --> 00:01:40,076
It's a happy place for cooks. 

45
00:01:40,076 --> 00:01:42,276
It's an important transportation hub, 

46
00:01:42,276 --> 00:01:45,776
so all the good ingredients of Italy are gathered there. 

47
00:01:46,309 --> 00:01:47,342
That's why it's called... 

48
00:01:47,342 --> 00:01:49,309
- Bologna la grassa. / - La grassa. 

49
00:01:49,309 --> 00:01:51,642
That's what the city is called. 

50
00:01:51,642 --> 00:01:53,576
- It was a nice place. / - I see. 

51
00:01:53,576 --> 00:01:56,009
I can't wait to see Bologna. 

52
00:01:56,009 --> 00:01:58,509
Spain has its most popular dish. 

53
00:01:58,509 --> 00:02:00,509
- It's paella. / - Paella. 

54
00:02:00,509 --> 00:02:02,909
It's the city where paella was first made. 

55
00:02:02,909 --> 00:02:06,476
And Korea's proud soccer player, 

56
00:02:06,476 --> 00:02:08,542
Lee Kangin plays in that city. 

57
00:02:09,176 --> 00:02:10,476
That's right. 

58
00:02:10,476 --> 00:02:13,876
You can find oranges everywhere. 

59
00:02:13,876 --> 00:02:15,442
- It's everywhere. / - It really is. 

60
00:02:15,442 --> 00:02:18,876
We had freshly squeezed orange juice there. 

61
00:02:18,876 --> 00:02:20,976
It was the best orange juice I've ever had. 

62
00:02:20,976 --> 00:02:23,242
We went to... 

63
00:02:23,242 --> 00:02:25,676
- Valencia, Spain. / - Valencia? 

64
00:02:25,676 --> 00:02:27,609
This is part 2 of the gourmet trip. 

65
00:02:27,609 --> 00:02:29,076
The match between Valencia, Spain, 

66
00:02:29,076 --> 00:02:31,742
and Bologna, Italy, is about to begin. 

67
00:02:31,742 --> 00:02:33,709
Since this is a gourmet trip, 

68
00:02:33,709 --> 00:02:36,942
I'd like to ask you why you chose those cities. 

69
00:02:36,942 --> 00:02:39,109
When you go to Bologna, 

70
00:02:39,109 --> 00:02:40,909
you can try the best quality foods 

71
00:02:40,909 --> 00:02:42,476
at reasonable prices there. 

72
00:02:42,476 --> 00:02:45,042
The city is very close 

73
00:02:45,042 --> 00:02:47,142
to Firenze which is famous for its beef 

74
00:02:47,142 --> 00:02:49,142
and Parma is right next to there. 

75
00:02:49,142 --> 00:02:50,609
So they get good beef and cheese. 

76
00:02:50,609 --> 00:02:51,776
And there's Modena. 

77
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:54,042
- Balsamic. / - It's the origin of balsamic. 

78
00:02:54,809 --> 00:02:56,442
There are places like that, 

79
00:02:56,442 --> 00:03:00,809
so all the good ingredients go to Bologna. 

80
00:03:00,809 --> 00:03:02,442
So you can eat delicious foods 

81
00:03:02,442 --> 00:03:03,842
at low prices. 

82
00:03:03,842 --> 00:03:06,009
So you went there to have some vinegar? 

83
00:03:06,009 --> 00:03:07,209
We also had vinegar. 

84
00:03:07,209 --> 00:03:08,509
- I see. / - Yes. 

85
00:03:08,509 --> 00:03:09,676
We did. 

86
00:03:09,676 --> 00:03:11,642
And there's spaghetti Bolognese. 

87
00:03:11,642 --> 00:03:13,676
It's the basic pasta dish with beef and tomato sauce. 

88
00:03:13,676 --> 00:03:14,676
It sounds good. 

89
00:03:14,676 --> 00:03:16,742
This city is where it started. 

90
00:03:17,509 --> 00:03:18,709
I was surprised. 

91
00:03:18,709 --> 00:03:19,942
"So this is what it tastes like." 

92
00:03:20,542 --> 00:03:22,909
I think this episode will be a match between... 

93
00:03:23,476 --> 00:03:27,609
The paella of Valencia and ragu pasta of Bologna. 

94
00:03:28,509 --> 00:03:32,442
You said Valencia is the origin of paella. 

95
00:03:32,442 --> 00:03:35,209
That's right. We are familiar with seafood paella. 

96
00:03:35,209 --> 00:03:37,142
It usually has mussel and shrimp in it. 

97
00:03:37,142 --> 00:03:39,209
We tried paella at the restaurant 

98
00:03:39,209 --> 00:03:40,142
where it was originated. 

99
00:03:40,809 --> 00:03:42,342
Guess what is in the paella. 

100
00:03:43,209 --> 00:03:44,476
Is it different? 

101
00:03:44,476 --> 00:03:45,542
You will see for yourself. 

102
00:03:45,542 --> 00:03:47,742
It has very unique ingredients in it. 

103
00:03:47,742 --> 00:03:49,042
I think I know what it is. 

104
00:03:49,042 --> 00:03:50,076
It's very unique. 

105
00:03:50,076 --> 00:03:51,742
It's not only that. 

106
00:03:51,742 --> 00:03:53,476
Valencia is the home 

107
00:03:53,476 --> 00:03:57,042
of traditional Spanish dessert. 

108
00:03:57,042 --> 00:03:58,576
Dessert! 

109
00:03:58,576 --> 00:04:02,576
We can say all the famous desserts of Spain 

110
00:04:02,576 --> 00:04:04,542
started in this city. 

111
00:04:04,542 --> 00:04:08,676
Traditional bread, beverages and even snacks. 

112
00:04:08,676 --> 00:04:10,642
You can taste the original there. 

113
00:04:10,642 --> 00:04:12,876
It's the best place for a gourmet trip. 

114
00:04:12,876 --> 00:04:15,542
With us, there's coffee. 

115
00:04:15,542 --> 00:04:17,909
- Coffee? / - You can find good coffee in Italy. 

116
00:04:17,909 --> 00:04:21,142
I realized that Italy has really good espresso. 

117
00:04:21,142 --> 00:04:23,076
- I see. / - Since we lost last week... 

118
00:04:23,076 --> 00:04:24,776
I'd like to promote a little more. 

119
00:04:24,776 --> 00:04:28,276
I had the best steak of my life there. 

120
00:04:30,276 --> 00:04:31,342
It's meat? 

121
00:04:31,342 --> 00:04:33,476
Sikyung, I heard you cooked it for yourself. 

122
00:04:33,476 --> 00:04:34,642
It's meat? 

123
00:04:34,642 --> 00:04:36,009
We have to win this time. 

124
00:04:36,009 --> 00:04:38,376
I can't lose again like this. 

125
00:04:38,376 --> 00:04:39,642
It wasn't fair for the past 2 weeks. 

126
00:04:39,642 --> 00:04:40,776
We will also... 

127
00:04:40,776 --> 00:04:43,209
- Commit a small foul this time. / - Okay. 

128
00:04:43,209 --> 00:04:44,642
- Without getting ejected. / - Alright. 

129
00:04:44,642 --> 00:04:46,576
We will look forward to the best steak. 

130
00:04:46,576 --> 00:04:48,942
And we have this corner inside corner again. 

131
00:04:48,942 --> 00:04:51,142
Sook's Choice. 

132
00:04:51,142 --> 00:04:53,109
So far, 

133
00:04:53,109 --> 00:04:54,676
the best dish in my heart 

134
00:04:54,676 --> 00:04:57,009
is arroz caldoso. 

135
00:04:57,409 --> 00:04:59,809
On my way home, I thought 

136
00:04:59,809 --> 00:05:02,242
I really want to try it. 

137
00:05:02,676 --> 00:05:05,976
I hope we will have the best dishes today. 

138
00:05:05,976 --> 00:05:08,609
And Sook's Choice will continue. 

139
00:05:09,042 --> 00:05:12,109
Alright. We will go to Bologna, Italy first. 

140
00:05:12,109 --> 00:05:13,776
Please take a look at the menu first. 

141
00:05:14,276 --> 00:05:17,009
The menu has the dishes they had. 

142
00:05:17,009 --> 00:05:18,876
- It looks familiar. / - I've heard of panini before. 

143
00:05:18,876 --> 00:05:20,842
- Wine is here again. / - Panini is a kind of bread. 

144
00:05:20,842 --> 00:05:21,842

145
00:05:21,842 --> 00:05:23,709
- Right, wine continues. / - Panini. 

146
00:05:23,709 --> 00:05:25,242
What is tortellini? 

147
00:05:25,242 --> 00:05:28,209
- Tortellini. / - That's like Italian dumpling. 

148
00:05:28,942 --> 00:05:33,176
You either mix it with sauce or eat with soup. 

149
00:05:33,176 --> 00:05:36,842
It's similar to Korean food yet has a unique scent. 

150
00:05:36,842 --> 00:05:38,209
It was pretty unique dumpling. 

151
00:05:38,209 --> 00:05:40,609
It's a dumpling... 

152
00:05:40,609 --> 00:05:43,309
- But with meat and cheese. / - Cheese? 

153
00:05:43,309 --> 00:05:45,176
When you take a bite, you taste meat and cheese. 

154
00:05:45,642 --> 00:05:47,342
- It's ricotta cheese. / - Yes. 

155
00:05:47,342 --> 00:05:48,976
- It must be really good. / - It must be really good. 

156
00:05:48,976 --> 00:05:51,876
Don't you feel hungry after seeing the menu? 

157
00:05:51,876 --> 00:05:53,342
- Yes. / - I'm hungry. 

158
00:05:53,342 --> 00:05:55,276
We have something prepared. 

159
00:05:55,276 --> 00:05:57,876
(Special food for the guests) 

160
00:05:57,876 --> 00:05:59,742
We prepared something... 

161
00:05:59,742 --> 00:06:01,576
I can't even talk. My mouth is already watering. 

162
00:06:02,376 --> 00:06:04,342
- Here we go. / - What is it? 

163
00:06:04,342 --> 00:06:05,942
Please bring the food. 

164
00:06:05,942 --> 00:06:07,576
- It's ice cream. / - What is that? 

165
00:06:07,576 --> 00:06:08,642
- What is that? / - Is that shaved ice? 

166
00:06:10,376 --> 00:06:13,442
(Bologna balsamic vinegar and sweet ice cream) 

167
00:06:13,442 --> 00:06:16,276
(Bologna's special dessert, balsamic ice cream) 

168
00:06:18,876 --> 00:06:21,309
- Thank you for this. / - Enjoy it. 

169
00:06:21,942 --> 00:06:23,042
It smells... 

170
00:06:23,042 --> 00:06:24,242
(Balsamic ice cream has a unique scent) 

171
00:06:24,242 --> 00:06:25,642
Is it a smell of vanilla? 

172
00:06:26,176 --> 00:06:28,209
- Why is it so good? / - It's so good. 

173
00:06:28,209 --> 00:06:30,176

00:06:30,176 --> 00:06:31,576
- It has a caramel scent. / - Yes. 

175
00:06:32,976 --> 00:06:34,642
I think I know. 

176
00:06:34,642 --> 00:06:36,742
- Sweet and sour? / - It's sweet and sour. 

177
00:06:36,742 --> 00:06:39,176
- It tastes even fresher. / - Right. 

178
00:06:39,176 --> 00:06:42,176
- It tastes really strange. / - It's so good. 

179
00:06:42,176 --> 00:06:45,109
It tastes like vinegar at first, then it tastes sweet. 

180
00:06:45,109 --> 00:06:47,209
- Doesn't it look good? / - And the caramel bursts. 

181
00:06:47,209 --> 00:06:48,976
- On the top of it... / - I want to have it too. 

182
00:06:48,976 --> 00:06:51,309
This isn't chocolate on the top. 

183
00:06:51,909 --> 00:06:54,209
I think it's caramel, vanilla... 

184
00:06:54,209 --> 00:06:56,376
And vinegar. 

185
00:06:56,376 --> 00:06:57,409
- Vinegar? / - Vinegar? 

186
00:06:57,409 --> 00:06:59,109
- Yes, it has the vinegar scent. / - Right. 

187
00:07:00,042 --> 00:07:01,176
It's a good mixture of the three. 

188
00:07:01,176 --> 00:07:03,276
It's really good when they're mixed. 

189
00:07:03,276 --> 00:07:04,876
- Sook. / - Is this a dessert? 

190
00:07:05,309 --> 00:07:06,309
Yes, it's a dessert. 

191
00:07:08,376 --> 00:07:09,676
Gosh. 

192
00:07:09,676 --> 00:07:12,109
- I'm so curious... / - Right. 

193
00:07:12,109 --> 00:07:14,176
- That I must hurry. / - Okay. 

194
00:07:14,176 --> 00:07:16,709
Paradise of gourmet, Bologna. 

195
00:07:16,709 --> 00:07:17,909
Let's go together. 

196
00:07:17,909 --> 00:07:19,609
(The trip to Bologna begins) 

197
00:07:21,442 --> 00:07:23,976
Wow, is that it? I feel like I'm in Italy now. 

198
00:07:23,976 --> 00:07:25,876
This really is the city of water. 

199
00:07:25,876 --> 00:07:27,342
It totally feels like Italy. 

200
00:07:27,342 --> 00:07:30,776
- Italian cuisine is simple. / - That's right. That dish! 

201
00:07:30,776 --> 00:07:33,142
- Oh, this one... / - I can't stop eating. 

202
00:07:33,142 --> 00:07:33,942
I have to be careful. 

203
00:07:33,942 --> 00:07:35,742
Honestly, it's so good. 

204
00:07:36,542 --> 00:07:38,942
It's good. It's so good. 

205
00:07:38,942 --> 00:07:39,976
It's so romantic. 

206
00:07:39,976 --> 00:07:41,942
It's overflowing with love. 

207
00:07:41,942 --> 00:07:43,342
It's nice being here with you. 

208
00:07:43,342 --> 00:07:44,442
Honey, I'll take a picture of you. 

209
00:07:44,442 --> 00:07:46,709
I can't help that it's good. 

210
00:07:47,076 --> 00:07:48,942
This really is romantic. 

211
00:07:48,942 --> 00:07:50,576
That was so funny. 

212
00:07:50,909 --> 00:07:52,109
Bromance. 

213
00:07:52,742 --> 00:07:54,642
In terms of food... 

214
00:07:55,376 --> 00:07:56,976
How about Bologna? 

215
00:07:56,976 --> 00:07:59,709
Koreans aren't familiar 

216
00:07:59,709 --> 00:08:00,876
with Bologna. 

217
00:08:01,409 --> 00:08:03,276
- Bologna is... / - No, we don't. 

218
00:08:03,276 --> 00:08:05,976
- We only know Bolognese sauce. / - Right. 

219
00:08:05,976 --> 00:08:09,109
It's the origin of meat sauce. 

220
00:08:09,109 --> 00:08:11,242
But Italians say 

221
00:08:11,242 --> 00:08:13,009
it's one of the best gourmet city. 

222
00:08:13,009 --> 00:08:15,309
There are a few places. First, it has good nature. 

223
00:08:15,309 --> 00:08:17,442
It's a fertile region since there are 

224
00:08:17,442 --> 00:08:18,109
mountains and fields. 

225
00:08:18,109 --> 00:08:20,009
We often go to Venice and Firenze. 

226
00:08:20,009 --> 00:08:21,476
It's between the two cities. 

227
00:08:22,242 --> 00:08:23,576
Seriously. 

228
00:08:23,576 --> 00:08:26,342
It's also a transport hub. 

229
00:08:26,342 --> 00:08:28,976
It receives various ingredients from other regions. 

230
00:08:28,976 --> 00:08:31,576
They do produce their own ingredients 

231
00:08:31,576 --> 00:08:33,576
but since they have a lot of exchange, 

232
00:08:33,576 --> 00:08:36,242
their recipes and food culture are more developed. 

233
00:08:36,242 --> 00:08:37,276
Bologna sounds good. 

234
00:08:37,276 --> 00:08:39,142
I think it's meaningful to visit Bologna 

235
00:08:39,142 --> 00:08:40,242
for a gourmet trip. 

236
00:08:40,242 --> 00:08:42,009
- I'm going to gain so much weight. / - Yes. 

237
00:08:42,776 --> 00:08:45,609
It's called Bologna la grassa, the city of gluttony. 

238
00:08:46,542 --> 00:08:48,576
- It's amazing. / - That steak looks awesome. 

239
00:08:49,442 --> 00:08:50,776
They support each other. 

240
00:08:50,776 --> 00:08:52,476
Wait. It's too much. 

241
00:08:52,476 --> 00:08:54,542
This is so good. 

242
00:08:55,609 --> 00:08:57,176
The ingredients support each other. 

243
00:08:57,176 --> 00:08:58,309
They mix, blend and complete. 

244
00:08:58,309 --> 00:09:00,842
- What should I do with that? / - It must the sauce. 

245
00:09:00,842 --> 00:09:02,009
It has really nice smell. 

246
00:09:02,409 --> 00:09:04,276
It will be totally different to Venice. 

247
00:09:04,276 --> 00:09:05,542
(The city of gluttony, Bologna) 

248
00:09:05,542 --> 00:09:07,676
- This looks so good. / - That? 

249
00:09:07,976 --> 00:09:10,276
It's sour, bitter and sweet. 

250
00:09:11,909 --> 00:09:14,209
Can I lick my plate? Amazing. 

251
00:09:15,576 --> 00:09:18,442
I can't wait to find out the one Sikyung cleaned. 

252
00:09:18,442 --> 00:09:21,142
(Ecstatic gourmet food makes them lose it) 

253
00:09:21,142 --> 00:09:22,876
- It's here. / - It's good. 

254
00:09:22,876 --> 00:09:24,642
It's not for the show. I'm truly happy. 

255
00:09:25,842 --> 00:09:28,242
(We Will Eat Tour in Bologna, Day 1) 

256
00:09:28,242 --> 00:09:29,676
Gourmet city? 

257
00:09:30,776 --> 00:09:35,676
(We Will Eat Tour in Bologna, Day 2) 

258
00:09:37,042 --> 00:09:44,576
(A new journey awaits in the morning in Venice) 

259
00:09:46,442 --> 00:09:47,476
That vibe. 

260
00:09:47,476 --> 00:09:49,042
(It's full of people starting their day) 

261
00:09:49,642 --> 00:09:52,676
(We Will Eat Tour visits the train station) 

262
00:09:52,676 --> 00:09:55,142
- Did you have a good sleep? / - I did. 

263
00:09:55,576 --> 00:09:57,409
- Today, we're heading to... / - Yes. 

264
00:09:57,409 --> 00:09:59,242
Europe has a good train system. 

265
00:09:59,242 --> 00:10:01,509
We're going to Bologna by train. 

266
00:10:02,109 --> 00:10:05,242
Bologna is called Bologna la grassa. 

267
00:10:06,409 --> 00:10:09,476
- Bologna la grassa. / - The city of gluttony. 

268
00:10:09,476 --> 00:10:11,076
Because it's a gourmet city? 

269
00:10:11,076 --> 00:10:13,142
- It's my city. / - Okay. 

270
00:10:13,142 --> 00:10:14,876
(Sweet Bologna is my city) 

271
00:10:14,876 --> 00:10:17,209
So I wore the pig color. 

272
00:10:17,209 --> 00:10:19,576
- Pink. / - It's the ham color. 

273
00:10:19,576 --> 00:10:20,609
- "Ham color." / - "Ham color." 

274
00:10:21,042 --> 00:10:23,142
- It's my city. / - Okay. 

275
00:10:23,142 --> 00:10:25,309
(Laughing) 

276
00:10:25,309 --> 00:10:27,376
Let's find out why it became the city of pigs. 

277
00:10:27,376 --> 00:10:28,976
Apparently their food is really good. 

278
00:10:28,976 --> 00:10:32,242
We haven't had ragu pasta, meat sauce yet. 

279
00:10:32,242 --> 00:10:33,442
We're going to have it there. 

280
00:10:33,442 --> 00:10:35,142
- Bologna. / - Let's go in. 

281
00:10:35,609 --> 00:10:39,209
(Train ticket, $32.50 per person. Passport is needed) 

282
00:10:39,209 --> 00:10:43,042
(We Will Eat Tour heads to Bologna leaving Venice) 

283
00:10:43,042 --> 00:10:44,809
(Italy) 

284
00:10:44,809 --> 00:10:49,276
(1.5 hours by train from Venice to Bologna Station) 

285
00:10:50,276 --> 00:10:56,342
(The city of red roofs, Bologna) 

286
00:10:56,342 --> 00:10:59,542
They have a different type of architecture. 

287
00:11:00,142 --> 00:11:01,876
(The city of love, Bologna) 

288
00:11:01,876 --> 00:11:04,076
- It's the city of love. / - How wonderful. 

289
00:11:05,642 --> 00:11:07,142
The men all look handsome. 

290
00:11:07,976 --> 00:11:09,076
Oh, my. 

291
00:11:09,642 --> 00:11:12,676
Don't you think we make more physical contact now? 

292
00:11:14,009 --> 00:11:15,542
We've been through a lot together. 

293
00:11:15,542 --> 00:11:16,576
We've been through so much. 

294
00:11:16,576 --> 00:11:18,309
Now, this is 

295
00:11:18,309 --> 00:11:21,276
Bologna Centrale. A railway station. 

296
00:11:21,276 --> 00:11:23,909
We're going to start... 

297
00:11:23,909 --> 00:11:26,042
- At the square here. / - Okay. 

298
00:11:26,042 --> 00:11:28,009
The square is close this way. 

299
00:11:28,009 --> 00:11:29,776
Let's walk to the square. 

300
00:11:29,776 --> 00:11:33,976
(Gourmet city's alleyways) 

301
00:11:33,976 --> 00:11:37,109
We were late in the morning for the train. 

302
00:11:37,109 --> 00:11:38,876
I have no energy because I haven't had coffee. 

303
00:11:38,876 --> 00:11:41,342
- We need to drink coffee straight. / - Yes. 

304
00:11:41,809 --> 00:11:43,909
- How about some coffee? / - Coffee. 

305
00:11:43,909 --> 00:11:45,976
So many places sell coffee. 

306
00:11:46,476 --> 00:11:47,676
I'm not pretending to be European. 

307
00:11:47,676 --> 00:11:49,876
I just feel like it in the morning. 

308
00:11:49,876 --> 00:11:51,976
Right. You crave for coffee in the morning in Europe. 

309
00:11:51,976 --> 00:11:53,576
That place looks like a cafe. 

310
00:11:54,242 --> 00:11:55,342
I know. 

311
00:11:55,342 --> 00:11:56,409
Shall we check it out? 

312
00:11:56,409 --> 00:11:58,309
We'll get a cup of coffee. 

313
00:11:58,809 --> 00:12:00,676
See? You can smell coffee. 

314
00:12:00,676 --> 00:12:02,309
Don't you smell coffee every time... 

315
00:12:02,309 --> 00:12:04,542
- You walk down the street? / - Yes, you're right. 

316
00:12:04,542 --> 00:12:06,042
Especially in Italy. 

317
00:12:06,042 --> 00:12:07,242
(You can't miss coffee at the start of the day) 

318
00:12:07,242 --> 00:12:09,909
We just went to a cafe in front of the hotel. 

319
00:12:10,676 --> 00:12:12,576
- It was unplanned. / - I see. 

320
00:12:13,409 --> 00:12:14,876
That's why we're filming it. 

321
00:12:15,876 --> 00:12:17,509
- And it's still good. / - How does it taste? 

322
00:12:18,309 --> 00:12:19,309
It's strong. 

323
00:12:19,309 --> 00:12:21,409
(They smell the strong coffee) 

324
00:12:22,142 --> 00:12:24,909
(The two drink together) 

325
00:12:24,909 --> 00:12:26,542
(Good) 

326
00:12:26,976 --> 00:12:29,642
Anywhere you go, it's above average. 

327
00:12:29,642 --> 00:12:30,942
(Coffee is good everywhere you go in Italy) 

328
00:12:31,876 --> 00:12:35,542
(He takes one more sip since it's good) 

329
00:12:35,942 --> 00:12:37,409
(Satisfied) 

330
00:12:37,809 --> 00:12:40,609
In Italy, they drink espresso a lot 

331
00:12:40,609 --> 00:12:42,276
but they also drink a lot of cappuccino. 

332
00:12:42,276 --> 00:12:44,609
When they want something lighter, 

333
00:12:44,609 --> 00:12:46,709
they drink cappuccino. 

334
00:12:49,442 --> 00:12:54,842
(A cup of light cappuccino like the locals) 

335
00:12:57,609 --> 00:13:03,209
(20-minute walk from Bologna Centrale to the square) 

336
00:13:03,676 --> 00:13:06,809
- I feel awake now. / - The scent lingers in my mouth. 

337
00:13:06,809 --> 00:13:08,476
It feels great. 

338
00:13:08,476 --> 00:13:09,742
(Smacking his lips) 

339
00:13:10,309 --> 00:13:13,442
(We Will Eat Tour takes a walk in Bologna) 

340
00:13:13,776 --> 00:13:15,776
(He's feeling good) 

341
00:13:16,309 --> 00:13:17,642
The buildings are pretty. 

342
00:13:18,242 --> 00:13:19,876
I like that brick building. 

343
00:13:19,876 --> 00:13:20,976
This one too. 

344
00:13:20,976 --> 00:13:22,709
(Everything looks nice and pretty on the trip) 

345
00:13:22,709 --> 00:13:25,242
Almost all buildings were like that. 

346
00:13:25,242 --> 00:13:27,109
We didn't have to worry about rain. 

347
00:13:27,109 --> 00:13:30,942
All the buildings in the city have extra space 

348
00:13:30,942 --> 00:13:32,342
for these arched roofs. 

349
00:13:32,342 --> 00:13:34,976
- Oh, that's right. / - There's a roof over all walkways. 

350
00:13:34,976 --> 00:13:36,609
You don't need to worry even in the rain. 

351
00:13:37,342 --> 00:13:40,142
- It's nice and cozy. / - You won't need umbrellas. 

352
00:13:40,142 --> 00:13:41,942
(The corridor connects Bologna city endlessly) 

353
00:13:41,942 --> 00:13:43,476
It's beautiful. 

354
00:13:43,476 --> 00:13:44,842
It's really beautiful. 

355
00:13:45,676 --> 00:13:47,442
- The ceiling is so pretty. / - I know, right? 

356
00:13:47,442 --> 00:13:49,842
I know it sounds obvious but it feels different. 

357
00:13:50,576 --> 00:13:52,709
It's big that there's no water. 

358
00:13:55,409 --> 00:13:56,709
It's beautiful. 

359
00:13:56,709 --> 00:14:01,509
(The center of the Bologna tourism) 

360
00:14:06,809 --> 00:14:10,142
(Piazza Maggiore) 

361
00:14:10,142 --> 00:14:12,376
Are there many tourists? 

362
00:14:12,376 --> 00:14:14,776
There are many European tourists, Italian tourists. 

363
00:14:14,776 --> 00:14:17,609
Italians from other regions come to travel. 

364
00:14:17,609 --> 00:14:18,776
I didn't see that many Asians. 

365
00:14:18,776 --> 00:14:20,776
- Because we don't... / - It's same for Valencia. 

366
00:14:21,276 --> 00:14:23,076
- Really? / - I barely met Asians in Valencia. 

367
00:14:23,076 --> 00:14:25,709
There were none. We only met one Korean. 

368
00:14:25,709 --> 00:14:27,509
We didn't meet any Koreans at all. 

369
00:14:27,509 --> 00:14:29,109
- None in Bologna? / - No. 

370
00:14:30,176 --> 00:14:32,509
When we pass there, 

371
00:14:32,509 --> 00:14:34,109
we'll see a cathedral. 

372
00:14:34,109 --> 00:14:35,976
It's the 5th largest cathedral in the world. 

373
00:14:36,642 --> 00:14:39,209
The pope at the time said, "Hey." 

374
00:14:39,876 --> 00:14:41,276
"Don't go overboard." 

375
00:14:41,276 --> 00:14:42,642
So they couldn't build it bigger. 

376
00:14:42,642 --> 00:14:43,709
Even though they stopped building, 

377
00:14:43,709 --> 00:14:44,976
it's still the 5th largest one. 

378
00:14:45,676 --> 00:14:47,176
After we pass here... 

379
00:14:47,876 --> 00:14:49,742
They tried to build the biggest... 

380
00:14:49,742 --> 00:14:52,042
- Then the pope didn't want it. / - It's huge. 

381
00:14:52,042 --> 00:14:53,609
(Exclaiming) 

382
00:14:53,609 --> 00:14:55,376
- It's a cathedral? / - It's unbelievably big. 

383
00:14:55,376 --> 00:14:56,809
But it looks very weird. 

384
00:14:59,209 --> 00:15:00,609
(Basilica di San Petronio) 

385
00:15:00,609 --> 00:15:02,809
- That's a cathedral? / - That's a cathedral? 

386
00:15:02,809 --> 00:15:04,942
They didn't finish the wall. 

387
00:15:05,676 --> 00:15:07,809
The top and the bottom look different. 

388
00:15:07,809 --> 00:15:10,176
It's surprisingly huge 

389
00:15:10,176 --> 00:15:11,509
when you see it, standing right there. 

390
00:15:12,342 --> 00:15:14,042
(Designed to be bigger but reduced due to budget) 

391
00:15:14,042 --> 00:15:15,609
How is that built by men? 

392
00:15:15,609 --> 00:15:17,242
Is that... 

393
00:15:17,242 --> 00:15:19,342
- All of that? / - That's all cathedral. 

394
00:15:19,342 --> 00:15:21,176
I can tell they stopped in the middle. 

395
00:15:21,176 --> 00:15:22,876
They could've made the top... 

396
00:15:23,476 --> 00:15:24,809
Fancy like the bottom but they didn't. 

397
00:15:24,809 --> 00:15:27,242
So I would say I know the half of it 

398
00:15:27,242 --> 00:15:28,876
but not the other half. 

399
00:15:28,876 --> 00:15:30,209
It's really huge. 

400
00:15:30,209 --> 00:15:31,776
It's unbelievable. 

401
00:15:32,442 --> 00:15:33,776
It's quite charming. 

402
00:15:33,776 --> 00:15:36,476
It's still used as a cathedral. 

403
00:15:37,242 --> 00:15:38,409
Seriously? 

404
00:15:38,409 --> 00:15:39,242
It's the size of a baseball stadium. 

405
00:15:39,242 --> 00:15:40,609
It can seat up to 28,000 people. 

406
00:15:41,109 --> 00:15:42,842
How do they come out? 

407
00:15:42,842 --> 00:15:44,476
The cathedral is the size of a baseball stadium? 

408
00:15:44,476 --> 00:15:46,342
- That's unbelievably big. / - That's huge. 

409
00:15:47,542 --> 00:15:51,642
(What's the next schedule after enjoying history?) 

410
00:15:52,042 --> 00:15:53,776
Basilica di San Petronio. 

411
00:15:54,542 --> 00:15:56,942
Since we've seen the grand cathedral... 

412
00:15:56,942 --> 00:15:58,909
Now that we're in Bologna... 

413
00:15:59,309 --> 00:16:01,576
We need to tour every alley. 

414
00:16:01,576 --> 00:16:03,109
Alleyways of Bologna is the real deal. 

415
00:16:03,109 --> 00:16:04,842
It'd be very different from Venice. 

416
00:16:04,842 --> 00:16:06,676
Yes, I can already see it in the distance. 

417
00:16:06,676 --> 00:16:07,809
It feels different. 

418
00:16:07,809 --> 00:16:10,042
That patio is pretty nice. 

419
00:16:10,042 --> 00:16:11,042
Let's check it out. 

420
00:16:11,042 --> 00:16:12,042
Sounds good. 

421
00:16:12,576 --> 00:16:13,409
(Cathedral) 

422
00:16:13,409 --> 00:16:14,942
Oh, wow. 

423
00:16:14,942 --> 00:16:16,442
Nice. 

424
00:16:16,442 --> 00:16:18,642
The color is nice. 

425
00:16:18,642 --> 00:16:21,809
It's different from the alleys in Venice. 

426
00:16:21,809 --> 00:16:23,142
- It's pretty. / - It's different. 

427
00:16:23,142 --> 00:16:25,576
- It's amazing. / - It's awesome. 

428
00:16:25,576 --> 00:16:28,242
I loved the alley right next to it. 

429
00:16:29,276 --> 00:16:32,009
- What is that? / - That's the ingredient market. 

430
00:16:32,009 --> 00:16:34,009
Every alley is a specialty store. 

431
00:16:34,009 --> 00:16:35,476
- It's all ham and cheese. / - Ham and cheese. 

432
00:16:35,476 --> 00:16:36,109
Seafood. 

433
00:16:36,109 --> 00:16:40,076
It's not just a market but there are cafes too. 

434
00:16:40,076 --> 00:16:41,709
(They even have a food walking tour here) 

435
00:16:41,709 --> 00:16:43,842
- It's so pretty. / - It's so pretty. 

436
00:16:43,842 --> 00:16:45,376
- It's all very small. / - In Bologna... 

437
00:16:45,376 --> 00:16:48,776
Food walking tours are very popular. 

438
00:16:48,776 --> 00:16:51,476
When you walk down the street, 

439
00:16:51,476 --> 00:16:54,209
you can see a group of 3 or 4 people. 

440
00:16:54,209 --> 00:16:56,809
And the person holding a flag 

441
00:16:56,809 --> 00:16:59,309
speaks English with an Italian accent 

442
00:16:59,309 --> 00:17:00,576
and describes everything. 

443
00:17:00,576 --> 00:17:02,309
What's good and why you eat it this way. 

444
00:17:02,309 --> 00:17:04,276
- They're all on a food tour? / - Yes. 

445
00:17:04,909 --> 00:17:06,776
- I want to go there. / - I don't need those ingredients... 

446
00:17:06,776 --> 00:17:08,676
- But I want to buy them. / - For real. 

447
00:17:08,676 --> 00:17:09,742
Yeah. 

448
00:17:10,209 --> 00:17:14,242
(When you go further inside the alley) 

449
00:17:14,242 --> 00:17:23,809
(There's an outdoor market with fresh ingredients) 

450
00:17:24,476 --> 00:17:26,242
(Sweet) 

451
00:17:26,242 --> 00:17:27,909
Looks so fresh. 

452
00:17:29,342 --> 00:17:30,442
Zucchini. 

453
00:17:34,576 --> 00:17:37,009
This is really nice. Spring onion. 

454
00:17:38,442 --> 00:17:40,142
I'm happy. 

455
00:17:40,809 --> 00:17:43,742
We'll be happy if we have our newlywed home here. 

456
00:17:46,142 --> 00:17:47,642
You guys aren't married yet? 

457
00:17:48,276 --> 00:17:50,376
I thought you did last week. 

458
00:17:51,176 --> 00:17:53,376
It's such a wonderful market. 

459
00:17:54,142 --> 00:17:56,009
You can buy it here and eat it with bread. 

460
00:17:56,676 --> 00:17:58,909
Look. They buy bread here. 

461
00:17:58,909 --> 00:18:01,176
That looks like a hidden delicious restaurant. 

462
00:18:02,009 --> 00:18:03,576
Let's go eat. I can't take it anymore. 

463
00:18:03,576 --> 00:18:05,376
This looks pretty nice. This is nice. 

464
00:18:05,376 --> 00:18:06,676
Shall we take a look? 

465
00:18:06,676 --> 00:18:09,109
(It's unplanned but they enter because it looks nice) 

466
00:18:11,909 --> 00:18:15,009
(You can try various food at this hidden spot) 

467
00:18:15,009 --> 00:18:17,309
- Goodness. / - What is that? 

468
00:18:17,909 --> 00:18:19,776
- That looks good. / - That looks good. 

469
00:18:22,509 --> 00:18:24,776
(It's packed with locals) 

470
00:18:24,776 --> 00:18:27,842
- It looks nothing special. / - Yes. 

471
00:18:27,842 --> 00:18:29,676
- But you must not miss it. / - It was good. 

472
00:18:29,676 --> 00:18:31,976
It's fun to eat on the street. 

473
00:18:31,976 --> 00:18:35,142
- That looks good. / - It's Wonil's favorite. 

474
00:18:35,142 --> 00:18:37,709
I wanted to say, "Everything from here to here." 

475
00:18:37,709 --> 00:18:39,909
Everything from here to here. All of it. 

476
00:18:46,076 --> 00:18:48,109
Hey, I can't take it anymore. 

477
00:18:48,842 --> 00:18:50,442
We need to go eat now. 

478
00:18:50,442 --> 00:18:51,576
You need to eat there first. 

479
00:18:51,576 --> 00:18:54,242
- It's got to be good. / - Oh, my. 

480
00:18:54,242 --> 00:18:55,642
Mozzarella and prosciutto. 

481
00:18:55,642 --> 00:18:57,242
(Agony) 

482
00:18:57,242 --> 00:18:59,342
- "Agony." / - Gosh, what is that? 

483
00:18:59,342 --> 00:19:01,442
Because we were on the way to eat. 

484
00:19:01,442 --> 00:19:03,342
We're having bread on the way to eat. 

485
00:19:03,842 --> 00:19:05,376
We were contemplating whether to eat or not. 

486
00:19:05,376 --> 00:19:08,176
- Bread digests fast as you walk. / - Yes. 

487
00:19:08,842 --> 00:19:12,309
- It's hard. / - How about we share one? 

488
00:19:12,309 --> 00:19:13,776
- Shall we get one each? / - No, it's filling. 

489
00:19:13,776 --> 00:19:16,009
We can finish it at night then. 

490
00:19:16,009 --> 00:19:18,042
Let's try it. 

491
00:19:18,042 --> 00:19:19,309
- Sure. / - One bread per person. 

492
00:19:19,309 --> 00:19:20,876
We should get a glass of white wine. 

493
00:19:21,509 --> 00:19:24,009
- Wine. / - That wine was also good. 

494
00:19:24,009 --> 00:19:26,276
(They place an order with the staff's recommendation) 

495
00:19:26,276 --> 00:19:28,509
So, pretty much every place sells wine? 

496
00:19:28,509 --> 00:19:30,576
Because it's considered a beverage. 

497
00:19:30,576 --> 00:19:32,909
- A beverage? / - You don't drink to get drunk. 

498
00:19:32,909 --> 00:19:35,209
- It's a beverage. / - Wine helps the food... 

499
00:19:35,209 --> 00:19:37,009
Go down smoothly. 

500
00:19:37,876 --> 00:19:41,376
(Prosciutto and mozzarella on top of rucola) 

501
00:19:41,376 --> 00:19:42,742
- That's awesome. / - Awesome. 

502
00:19:46,076 --> 00:19:47,276
Guys. That's my favorite ham. 

503
00:19:47,276 --> 00:19:49,376
- Mortadella. / - That one. 

504
00:19:49,809 --> 00:19:52,909
- I'm wearing that ham color. / - Yes. 

505
00:19:52,909 --> 00:19:54,342
(Lettuce and pecorino cheese on top of mortadella) 

506
00:19:54,342 --> 00:19:56,609
And pecorino made with sheep milk. 

507
00:19:56,609 --> 00:19:58,876
- Pecorino? / - Pecorino cheese. 

508
00:19:58,876 --> 00:20:00,642
- Pecorino cheese. / - It's really good. 

509
00:20:00,642 --> 00:20:02,376
It's really good when it's grilled. 

510
00:20:02,376 --> 00:20:04,442
- That looks like banh mi. / - That looks good. 

511
00:20:04,442 --> 00:20:05,976
- I know. / - That one... 

512
00:20:05,976 --> 00:20:07,309
Those sandwiches were nothing special 

513
00:20:07,309 --> 00:20:08,442
but they were really good. 

514
00:20:08,442 --> 00:20:12,309
- It feels like Chelsea Market. / - Yes. 

515
00:20:12,309 --> 00:20:13,642
Salute. 

516
00:20:17,342 --> 00:20:20,342
It's nice. It's refreshing and relaxing. 

517
00:20:20,342 --> 00:20:22,109
(Let me take a sip) 

518
00:20:22,509 --> 00:20:24,709
- It's not that strong. / - No. 

519
00:20:24,709 --> 00:20:27,309
That's unique. A shop in the market sells 

520
00:20:27,309 --> 00:20:29,276
food and wine. 

521
00:20:33,342 --> 00:20:34,609
That ham looks really good. 

522
00:20:35,209 --> 00:20:36,342
It's good. 

523
00:20:36,342 --> 00:20:38,876
That corn sandwich is really good. 

524
00:20:41,342 --> 00:20:43,609
- I want to try it. / - It looks really good. 

525
00:20:43,609 --> 00:20:45,242
- Is it good? / - Yes. 

526
00:20:45,242 --> 00:20:46,276
It's good. 

527
00:20:47,076 --> 00:20:48,476
It makes me crave for pasta. 

528
00:20:49,676 --> 00:20:51,576
- Pasta. / - It's an appetizer. 

529
00:20:52,176 --> 00:20:53,009
The harmony of the three. 

530
00:20:53,009 --> 00:20:57,476
Salty ham, not salty cheese and rucola. 

531
00:20:57,476 --> 00:21:00,242
This is less salty ham and saltier cheese... 

532
00:21:00,242 --> 00:21:02,442
- And lettuce. / - With watery vegetable. 

533
00:21:02,442 --> 00:21:05,076
The bun is really good. 

534
00:21:05,076 --> 00:21:06,609
Bread, ham and cheese. 

535
00:21:07,176 --> 00:21:09,309
It's like rice, kimchi and soup in Korea. 

536
00:21:10,276 --> 00:21:12,076
I was going to leave some but I can't. 

537
00:21:14,209 --> 00:21:15,709
You should talk. 

538
00:21:16,376 --> 00:21:18,042
Talk about what? I'm eating. 

539
00:21:18,042 --> 00:21:21,042
You need to eat if it's good. 

540
00:21:24,242 --> 00:21:25,942
No words necessary for good food. 

541
00:21:26,676 --> 00:21:29,109
Is that an appetizer 

542
00:21:29,109 --> 00:21:30,109
before the meal? 

543
00:21:30,109 --> 00:21:31,676
- Yes. / - Wasn't intentional. 

544
00:21:31,676 --> 00:21:32,976
It's antipasti. 

545
00:21:35,376 --> 00:21:37,342
With an aperitif? 

546
00:21:43,976 --> 00:21:45,576
(The glass of wine enhances the flavor) 

547
00:21:45,576 --> 00:21:46,609
It's perfect with wine. 

548
00:21:47,709 --> 00:21:50,342
It's really good. 

549
00:21:50,342 --> 00:21:52,242
- It's really good. / - It was a good choice to eat. 

550
00:21:52,742 --> 00:21:55,809
(They finish the sandwich and wine as their antipasti) 

551
00:21:56,742 --> 00:21:59,742
- Aren't you hungry? / - Yes, I am. 

552
00:21:59,742 --> 00:22:01,542
Also, this is Bologna. 

553
00:22:01,542 --> 00:22:03,142
You know about the food. 

554
00:22:03,142 --> 00:22:04,376
What comes to your mind about Bologna? 

555
00:22:04,376 --> 00:22:05,742
In English. 

556
00:22:05,742 --> 00:22:07,976
- Kimchi stew? / - Like kimchi stew. It's red. 

557
00:22:07,976 --> 00:22:09,042
- Bolognese. / - Yes. 

558
00:22:10,109 --> 00:22:12,742
Bolognese means "Bologna's." 

559
00:22:12,742 --> 00:22:14,142
Bologna's sauce. 

560
00:22:14,142 --> 00:22:15,576
We need to go try that sauce. 

561
00:22:16,142 --> 00:22:18,076
We've been holding back. 

562
00:22:18,076 --> 00:22:19,342
Yes. We didn't eat on purpose. 

563
00:22:19,342 --> 00:22:22,276
We didn't try tomato sauce in Venice. 

564
00:22:22,276 --> 00:22:25,842
We've been holding back with appetizers. 

565
00:22:25,842 --> 00:22:27,242
- Lead the way. / - Let's go eat pasta. 

566
00:22:27,242 --> 00:22:28,942
Let's go have ragu. 

567
00:22:28,942 --> 00:22:31,242
(Off they go without hesitating) 

568
00:22:31,876 --> 00:22:33,142
(We Will Eat Tour in Bologna, Day 1) 

569
00:22:33,142 --> 00:22:34,209
(Bolognese pasta) 

570
00:22:34,209 --> 00:22:35,942
Right, you must try it. 

571
00:22:37,242 --> 00:22:42,976
(11-minute walk from the alley to the restaurant) 

572
00:22:43,642 --> 00:22:44,742
We must try this. 

573
00:22:46,542 --> 00:22:48,142
(We Will Eat Tour is seduced by a grocery store) 

574
00:22:48,142 --> 00:22:49,242
Arancini. 

575
00:22:49,242 --> 00:22:51,776
I was curious to try everything. 

576
00:22:51,776 --> 00:22:54,109
- Look. / - You can't go eat? 

577
00:22:54,109 --> 00:22:56,276
No, there's so much food on the way. 

578
00:22:57,376 --> 00:22:59,976
Even before we reach the restaurant... This is bad. 

579
00:23:00,409 --> 00:23:04,609
One arancini and that's... Two maybe. Little bit. 

580
00:23:06,809 --> 00:23:10,642
(2 arancini, $6.76) 

581
00:23:10,642 --> 00:23:12,709
You know arancini, right? Deep fried rice. 

582
00:23:12,709 --> 00:23:14,576
- Deep fried rice. / - Deep fried rice and cheese. 

583
00:23:15,009 --> 00:23:18,009
- Cheese and rice. / - That's awesome. 

584
00:23:18,009 --> 00:23:21,842
These are artichokes pickled in vinegar and olive oil. 

585
00:23:21,842 --> 00:23:22,876
It's very soft. 

586
00:23:22,876 --> 00:23:24,876
(They have the artichoke like a pickle) 

587
00:23:31,742 --> 00:23:33,342
I could eat 12 of these. 

588
00:23:33,342 --> 00:23:34,542
(Agreed) 

589
00:23:35,109 --> 00:23:36,142
Let's eat. 

590
00:23:36,142 --> 00:23:38,442
(They're eating without a break) 

591
00:23:38,442 --> 00:23:41,442
- That looks so good. / - Did you see the cheese stretch? 

592
00:23:41,909 --> 00:23:43,042
- So-so? / - So-so? 

593
00:23:43,042 --> 00:23:44,042
It's just good. 

594
00:23:46,242 --> 00:23:51,476
(Whatever they eat, it's all good) 

595
00:23:52,176 --> 00:23:53,642
(It's good) 

596
00:23:54,042 --> 00:23:55,309
They haven't had the meal yet, right? 

597
00:23:55,309 --> 00:23:57,109
We're going to have pasta now. 

598
00:23:57,809 --> 00:23:59,842
- On the way. / - They keep eating on the way. 

599
00:24:00,542 --> 00:24:02,676
You can't help getting fat. 

600
00:24:03,409 --> 00:24:10,942
(They can't stop eating) 

601
00:24:11,342 --> 00:24:13,876
Let's go to the restaurant already. Carry it. 

602
00:24:13,876 --> 00:24:15,776
(He can't stop eating) 

603
00:24:16,676 --> 00:24:17,676
Let's go. 

604
00:24:17,676 --> 00:24:19,576
(Let's go have lunch now) 

605
00:24:23,176 --> 00:24:26,142
- Is it here? / - Yes. On your left. 

606
00:24:26,142 --> 00:24:28,642
It's the meat sauce spaghetti we've been waiting for. 

607
00:24:28,642 --> 00:24:31,176
Yes. In other countries, they call it meat sauce. 

608
00:24:31,176 --> 00:24:33,809
Other places in Italy call it Bolognese. 

609
00:24:33,809 --> 00:24:35,776
- In Bologna, they call it... / - Ragu. 

610
00:24:35,776 --> 00:24:37,076
Ragu. 

611
00:24:37,076 --> 00:24:38,976
Let's go in. 

612
00:24:38,976 --> 00:24:40,309
(They enter with excitement) 

613
00:24:41,576 --> 00:24:44,209
- Is that it? / - Yes, that's ragu. 

614
00:24:44,209 --> 00:24:45,476
(The original Bolognese pasta they've been waiting for) 

615
00:24:46,709 --> 00:24:47,876
You know what? 

616
00:24:47,876 --> 00:24:52,909
Koreans are familiar with Bolognese spaghetti. 

617
00:24:52,909 --> 00:24:55,576
Spaghetti is normally consumed in the south. 

618
00:24:55,576 --> 00:24:58,309
In the city of ragu, Bologna, 

619
00:24:58,309 --> 00:25:00,742
you must try tagliatelle. 

620
00:25:00,742 --> 00:25:03,442
Let's have tagliatelle. What does it look like? 

621
00:25:03,442 --> 00:25:04,409
Knife-cut noodles. 

622
00:25:04,942 --> 00:25:08,776
That place has been open for over 50 years. 

623
00:25:08,776 --> 00:25:10,709
- It's a time-honored restaurant. / - Look at that. 

624
00:25:10,709 --> 00:25:11,742
- Raw pasta. / - It's raw pasta. 

625
00:25:11,742 --> 00:25:15,376
They make pasta and cut it every morning. 

626
00:25:15,376 --> 00:25:17,576
- It must be really good. / - They make tagliatelle. 

627
00:25:17,576 --> 00:25:20,876
- It had a thick egg scent. / - It's so much effort. 

628
00:25:21,342 --> 00:25:23,276
- It was very good. / - The pasta was yellow. 

629
00:25:23,676 --> 00:25:25,809
- Because of the good quality eggs. / - Look so good. 

630
00:25:27,309 --> 00:25:29,742
That's it. 

631
00:25:29,742 --> 00:25:30,876
(Fresh pasta with egg) 

632
00:25:30,876 --> 00:25:32,376
They don't bring them from a factory. 

633
00:25:32,376 --> 00:25:36,242
They make the dough themselves. 

634
00:25:36,242 --> 00:25:37,342
(The fresh pasta is mixed with the ragu sauce) 

635
00:25:37,342 --> 00:25:39,442
Don't do that, don't. 

636
00:25:39,442 --> 00:25:40,709
Don't do this to me. 

637
00:25:41,609 --> 00:25:43,909
- Look at the tomato oil. / - Gosh, that's crazy. 

638
00:25:45,609 --> 00:25:49,176
(Bolognese pasta, $18.20) 

639
00:25:49,176 --> 00:25:52,542
Gosh, I don't know. I'll put this up. 

640
00:25:52,542 --> 00:25:53,876
It looks so good. 

641
00:25:53,876 --> 00:25:57,509
After seeing how it's cooked, I have to move it up. 

642
00:25:57,509 --> 00:26:00,876
(Fresh pasta mixed with the ragu sauce) 

643
00:26:00,876 --> 00:26:03,076
It's not tomato paste sauce. 

644
00:26:03,076 --> 00:26:06,542
Crushed tomato is mixed in with olive oil. 

645
00:26:06,542 --> 00:26:07,676
It's mixed with grease from meat. 

646
00:26:07,676 --> 00:26:09,576
- The oil becomes red. / - Right. 

647
00:26:09,576 --> 00:26:10,742
Like chili oil. 

648
00:26:11,876 --> 00:26:15,509
(Sikyung takes a bite first) 

649
00:26:17,609 --> 00:26:18,942
How is it? 

650
00:26:18,942 --> 00:26:20,076
It's so good. 

651
00:26:21,642 --> 00:26:23,909
(He grunts because it's so good) 

652
00:26:23,909 --> 00:26:25,442
The pasta is so good. 

653
00:26:25,876 --> 00:26:27,509
(He continues to marvel at it) 

654
00:26:27,509 --> 00:26:31,042
The locals line up there for lunch. 

655
00:26:31,042 --> 00:26:32,909
It's not just Koreans. 

656
00:26:33,742 --> 00:26:34,809
I've had this before. 

657
00:26:36,509 --> 00:26:37,876
- It's so good. / - Right? 

658
00:26:37,876 --> 00:26:39,376
How should I describe this? 

659
00:26:39,376 --> 00:26:41,242
- What should I do? / - How do you make this? 

660
00:26:41,242 --> 00:26:43,142
I don't know. 

661
00:26:43,142 --> 00:26:44,576
(He can't think) 

662
00:26:44,576 --> 00:26:45,609
It's so good. 

663
00:26:46,276 --> 00:26:47,442
How can I describe this? 

664
00:26:47,942 --> 00:26:49,209
This is driving me crazy. 

665
00:26:50,776 --> 00:26:52,509
The pasta is fresh. 

666
00:26:53,309 --> 00:26:54,976
It's tender and chewy. 

667
00:26:54,976 --> 00:26:56,509
I thought I was eating omasum. 

668
00:26:58,009 --> 00:27:00,209
(He's truly amazed) 

669
00:27:00,209 --> 00:27:01,609
This is so good. 

670
00:27:02,242 --> 00:27:03,642
It's like thinly sliced fried scrambled egg 

671
00:27:03,642 --> 00:27:05,742
and also like knife-cut noodles. 

672
00:27:05,742 --> 00:27:08,042
Thinly sliced fried scrambled egg snaps. 

673
00:27:08,942 --> 00:27:10,542
Knife-cut noodles are very chewy. 

674
00:27:10,542 --> 00:27:11,642
This feels right in the middle. 

675
00:27:11,642 --> 00:27:13,409
It's bouncy but very thin. 

676
00:27:14,276 --> 00:27:18,076
I can kind of feel the starchiness. It's chewy. 

677
00:27:18,076 --> 00:27:20,076
(The texture of the pasta brings out the flavor) 

678
00:27:20,676 --> 00:27:22,809
That pasta looks so delicious. 

679
00:27:22,809 --> 00:27:25,109
It's not thick. It's so thin. 

680
00:27:25,109 --> 00:27:26,776
It was so good that I got flustered. 

681
00:27:27,276 --> 00:27:29,109
- I really want to try it. / - How could the pasta taste... 

682
00:27:29,109 --> 00:27:30,376
- Stop it. / - No. 

683
00:27:30,376 --> 00:27:31,976
Seriously. 

684
00:27:32,576 --> 00:27:35,542
You have an old friend who makes amazing pasta. 

685
00:27:35,542 --> 00:27:36,676
That's better than his pasta. 

686
00:27:39,076 --> 00:27:41,776
- Goodness. / - The pasta... 

687
00:27:41,776 --> 00:27:43,509
(You can only taste it in Bologna) 

688
00:27:43,509 --> 00:27:44,542
It's so good. 

689
00:27:44,542 --> 00:27:47,376
- The pasta and sauce are both good. / - So good. 

690
00:27:51,509 --> 00:27:56,342
(Joonwoo's tip, drizzle olive oil over the pasta) 

691
00:27:56,342 --> 00:27:59,609
It's like adding vinegar to cold noodles. 

692
00:28:00,342 --> 00:28:01,709
You sprinkle like this. 

693
00:28:01,709 --> 00:28:04,042
(Sprinkle Parmesan cheese over Bolognese pasta) 

694
00:28:04,042 --> 00:28:06,076
I want to try it with Parmesan cheese. 

695
00:28:07,442 --> 00:28:08,576
Gosh. Wait. 

696
00:28:08,576 --> 00:28:11,076
(He doesn't want to cut the pasta) 

697
00:28:11,076 --> 00:28:12,442
What am I doing? 

698
00:28:12,942 --> 00:28:15,742
(Happy) 

699
00:28:16,242 --> 00:28:17,909
I'll sprinkle some cheese. 

700
00:28:18,742 --> 00:28:23,576
(Sprinkling Parmesan cheese) 

701
00:28:26,576 --> 00:28:28,209
(Excited) 

702
00:28:28,209 --> 00:28:29,709
It tastes so good with that. 

703
00:28:30,642 --> 00:28:32,476
The pasta is so tasty. 

704
00:28:32,476 --> 00:28:36,376
(Olive oil and Parmesan cheese make it even better) 

705
00:28:37,676 --> 00:28:40,442
In Korea, it's half meat and half sauce. 

706
00:28:40,442 --> 00:28:42,776
- It's like soup. / - It's American style. 

707
00:28:42,776 --> 00:28:45,242
Meat sauce in Korea is 

708
00:28:45,242 --> 00:28:47,209
tomato sauce... 

709
00:28:47,209 --> 00:28:48,842
- With ground meat. / - With ground meat. 

710
00:28:49,609 --> 00:28:51,942
But with ragu, 

711
00:28:51,942 --> 00:28:53,476
meat is the main thing. 

712
00:28:53,476 --> 00:28:55,976
It's meat with tomato flavor. 

713
00:28:56,609 --> 00:28:58,109
I wonder what it tastes like. 

714
00:29:00,076 --> 00:29:05,242
(How about going to Italy to taste the original?) 

715
00:29:07,742 --> 00:29:11,709
(Next dish is tortelloni) 

716
00:29:11,709 --> 00:29:12,809
It smells amazing. 

717
00:29:12,809 --> 00:29:13,876
(He's already excited) 

718
00:29:13,876 --> 00:29:15,376
Gosh, they're really good. 

719
00:29:15,376 --> 00:29:17,009
I think... 

720
00:29:17,609 --> 00:29:19,876
Lovelyz would faint if they tried this. 

721
00:29:19,876 --> 00:29:22,409
- I want to faint. / - Dumplings. 

722
00:29:23,542 --> 00:29:24,542
- What's that? / - What is it? 

723
00:29:24,542 --> 00:29:26,676
- What is it? / - It's tortelloni. Big ones. 

724
00:29:26,676 --> 00:29:29,076
Tortelloni. It's like dumpling. 

725
00:29:29,076 --> 00:29:30,609
(Tortelloni, $18.20) 

726
00:29:30,609 --> 00:29:33,376
The wrapping is carbohydrate. 

727
00:29:33,376 --> 00:29:36,142
- Inside is cheese. / - Goodness. 

728
00:29:36,142 --> 00:29:37,409
The sauce is... 

729
00:29:37,876 --> 00:29:39,909
- Butter. It's mixed with butter. / - Goodness. 

730
00:29:41,376 --> 00:29:42,676
(Stop it) 

731
00:29:42,676 --> 00:29:43,842
Please make it. 

732
00:29:45,042 --> 00:29:47,409
- Seriously. / - Can we skip Valencia next week? 

733
00:29:47,409 --> 00:29:48,976
(Is Hwijae's team giving up?) 

734
00:29:48,976 --> 00:29:50,209
(Inside the tortelloni is cheese) 

735
00:29:50,209 --> 00:29:51,509
That looks really good. 

736
00:29:51,509 --> 00:29:53,542
The food ingredients reached their full potential. 

737
00:29:53,542 --> 00:29:56,309
That's how they eat it in that region. 

738
00:29:56,309 --> 00:29:58,042
It's the perfect basics. 

739
00:29:58,042 --> 00:29:59,576
Basically, they're dumplings. 

740
00:29:59,576 --> 00:30:01,242
They're dumplings. 

741
00:30:01,242 --> 00:30:03,009
When you look at Italian pasta... 

742
00:30:03,442 --> 00:30:04,876
When you look at the menu, 

743
00:30:04,876 --> 00:30:06,409
you find names that are slightly different 

744
00:30:06,409 --> 00:30:07,742
from what you know. 

745
00:30:07,742 --> 00:30:09,009
For example, 

746
00:30:09,009 --> 00:30:11,942
tortellini and tortelloni. 

747
00:30:11,942 --> 00:30:13,642
With "ini" at the end, 

748
00:30:13,642 --> 00:30:14,776
it means "small." 

749
00:30:14,776 --> 00:30:16,542
With "oni" at the end, 

750
00:30:16,542 --> 00:30:18,009
it's bigger than "ini." 

751
00:30:18,009 --> 00:30:19,976
So I'm like Sung Sikyungoni. 

752
00:30:19,976 --> 00:30:22,142
Right. You'd be Sung Sikyungoni. 

753
00:30:22,142 --> 00:30:23,909
- Kim Sook would be Kim Sookini. / - Yes. 

754
00:30:23,909 --> 00:30:26,509
- Sung Sikyungoni. / - It's "ini" vs. "oni." 

755
00:30:26,509 --> 00:30:28,409
(Let's eat it now) 

756
00:30:29,309 --> 00:30:30,676
I'm curious. 

757
00:30:30,676 --> 00:30:32,342
It's delicious but it's not expensive. 

758
00:30:32,909 --> 00:30:34,809
The smell alone is a pass. 

759
00:30:36,942 --> 00:30:37,942
(Sighing) 

760
00:30:37,942 --> 00:30:39,176
That must be really good. 

761
00:30:44,542 --> 00:30:49,542
(Unbelievable) 

762
00:30:50,909 --> 00:30:54,442
If Sikyung does that, that means it's really good. 

763
00:30:54,442 --> 00:30:55,909
I'll take down this from last week. 

764
00:30:58,576 --> 00:30:59,842
Tortelloni. 

765
00:30:59,842 --> 00:31:01,842
Guys, thank you 

766
00:31:01,842 --> 00:31:03,642
for letting us win last week. 

767
00:31:06,276 --> 00:31:09,709
They added a lot of eggs in the pasta. 

768
00:31:10,176 --> 00:31:11,642
It's really tasty. 

769
00:31:11,642 --> 00:31:12,809
(Tortelloni pasta with a lot of eggs) 

770
00:31:12,809 --> 00:31:14,909
It's a dumpling that's slightly hard. 

771
00:31:14,909 --> 00:31:17,476
It's less steamed dumpling. 

772
00:31:17,476 --> 00:31:19,576
The texture is very similar to the dumpling we know. 

773
00:31:19,576 --> 00:31:20,676
(Similar to less steamed dumpling) 

774
00:31:21,209 --> 00:31:22,342
What's inside? 

775
00:31:22,342 --> 00:31:23,742
- Is it cheese? / - Ricotta cheese. 

776
00:31:24,276 --> 00:31:25,642
It's like tofu. 

777
00:31:25,642 --> 00:31:27,676
It has better texture. 

778
00:31:27,676 --> 00:31:29,676
It lingers longer on your tongue. 

779
00:31:29,676 --> 00:31:31,676
It doesn't disappear. It lingers. 

780
00:31:31,676 --> 00:31:33,442
It's like eating real cheese. 

781
00:31:33,442 --> 00:31:35,209
In Korea, ricotta is like cream. 

782
00:31:35,209 --> 00:31:38,109
(The cheese flavor lingers in your mouth) 

783
00:31:40,609 --> 00:31:41,809
- Gosh. / - Goodness. 

784
00:31:42,942 --> 00:31:44,742
- I want to try it. / - That's butter. 

785
00:31:44,742 --> 00:31:46,876
- Think how tasty it'd be. / - The color is so pretty. 

786
00:31:47,776 --> 00:31:48,876
They don't sell this in Korea, do they? 

787
00:31:48,876 --> 00:31:50,409
People don't make this menu a lot in Korea. 

788
00:31:50,409 --> 00:31:51,576
(It's hard to find in Korea) 

789
00:31:51,576 --> 00:31:53,109
People usually make pasta with a lot of sauce. 

790
00:31:53,109 --> 00:31:54,376
- Please make it. / - But these two... 

791
00:31:54,376 --> 00:31:56,209
- Can make it. / - We can. 

792
00:31:56,209 --> 00:31:57,576
- We can do it. / - We can. 

793
00:31:57,576 --> 00:31:59,042
- We can do it. / - They can. 

794
00:31:59,042 --> 00:32:00,942
We'll go to your restaurant. 

795
00:32:00,942 --> 00:32:01,809
I own a Western restaurant. 

796
00:32:01,809 --> 00:32:02,676
So you can come to mine. 

797
00:32:02,676 --> 00:32:04,309
- Come to my restaurant. / - We will. For sure. 

798
00:32:04,309 --> 00:32:06,176
You can come to mine for Korean cuisine. 

799
00:32:07,176 --> 00:32:09,476
We'll fill out our first evaluation in Bologna. 

800
00:32:10,142 --> 00:32:15,109
(Reviews based on location, price, ambience) 

801
00:32:15,876 --> 00:32:20,709
(They write about their recommended dish) 

802
00:32:20,709 --> 00:32:21,709
I commented, 

803
00:32:21,709 --> 00:32:23,442
"The best ragu fresh pasta." 

804
00:32:23,909 --> 00:32:25,376
"You've probably never tasted this. 

805
00:32:25,376 --> 00:32:27,809
You'll feel like you've been fooled all this time." 

806
00:32:28,676 --> 00:32:31,209
"Both the pasta and sauce are the best." 

807
00:32:32,176 --> 00:32:33,276
This pasta... 

808
00:32:33,776 --> 00:32:35,309
Nobody would hate it. 

809
00:32:36,442 --> 00:32:38,142
It's so chewy. 

810
00:32:38,142 --> 00:32:39,542
(Yummy) 

811
00:32:39,542 --> 00:32:44,142
(Average score for Bolognese pasta, 4.25 stars) 

812
00:32:44,142 --> 00:32:46,309
- That looks really good. / - I really want to try it. 

813
00:32:48,376 --> 00:32:51,109
How do you know which restaurant is good? 

814
00:32:51,109 --> 00:32:52,776
I walk around 

815
00:32:52,776 --> 00:32:56,976
and find restaurants with a lot of old customers. 

816
00:32:56,976 --> 00:32:58,809
Whenever I go to that kind of restaurant, 

817
00:32:58,809 --> 00:33:00,076
I never fail. 

818
00:33:00,942 --> 00:33:02,209
Old local couples 

819
00:33:02,209 --> 00:33:05,109
go there to have a meal. 

820
00:33:05,109 --> 00:33:06,276
- So that restaurant can't fail. / - That's a great tip. 

821
00:33:07,442 --> 00:33:12,642
(The day in Bologna comes to an end) 

822
00:33:12,642 --> 00:33:14,509
So far... 

823
00:33:15,542 --> 00:33:17,509
- I love Bologna. / - Isn't it nice? 

824
00:33:17,509 --> 00:33:19,676
It's been great since the start. 

825
00:33:20,276 --> 00:33:23,176
I found a place that'll end our day 

826
00:33:23,176 --> 00:33:25,476
in Bologna with a bang. 

827
00:33:25,909 --> 00:33:27,609
It's a place where Bolognese hipsters go. 

828
00:33:27,609 --> 00:33:30,909
It's a cost-effective restaurant that young people go to. 

829
00:33:30,909 --> 00:33:32,076
- For hipsters. / - Yes. 

830
00:33:32,476 --> 00:33:33,642
Clearly, I'm not a hipster. 

831
00:33:33,642 --> 00:33:34,642
Don't say that. 

832
00:33:36,509 --> 00:33:38,276
Come on. You're a hipster. 

833
00:33:38,276 --> 00:33:39,409
Aren't I a hamster? 

834
00:33:39,409 --> 00:33:40,676
I'm sorry. 

835
00:33:40,676 --> 00:33:42,042
Maybe. 

836
00:33:42,042 --> 00:33:43,942
We can try traditional Bolognese food. 

837
00:33:43,942 --> 00:33:44,976
And, 

838
00:33:44,976 --> 00:33:46,376
the thing you like. 

839
00:33:46,376 --> 00:33:47,442
Mortadella. 

840
00:33:47,442 --> 00:33:48,909
(Italian traditional food and mortadella) 

841
00:33:49,776 --> 00:33:51,076
- We'll eat that. / - Nice. 

842
00:33:51,076 --> 00:33:52,142
White wine? 

843
00:33:52,142 --> 00:33:54,276
You can have white wine or beer. 

844
00:33:54,276 --> 00:33:55,809
(He's drooling just thinking about it) 

845
00:33:55,809 --> 00:33:57,509
- That's good. / - I'm happy just thinking about it. 

846
00:33:57,509 --> 00:33:58,909
Looking at Sikyung, 

847
00:33:58,909 --> 00:34:00,476
I already know it's delicious. 

848
00:34:00,476 --> 00:34:01,476
(We Will Eat Tour's dinner menu) 

849
00:34:02,376 --> 00:34:04,242
(Something for a cold evening) 

850
00:34:04,242 --> 00:34:06,342
(Warm Italian traditional dumpling soup) 

851
00:34:06,342 --> 00:34:09,709
(Assorted Italian hams on a plate) 

852
00:34:09,709 --> 00:34:13,542
(Wine can't be left out for dinner) 

853
00:34:13,709 --> 00:34:15,642
(They try the wine first) 

854
00:34:15,642 --> 00:34:17,742
We need to taste this region's wine. 

855
00:34:17,742 --> 00:34:18,909
Of course. 

856
00:34:18,909 --> 00:34:20,642
(A bottle of white wine, $22.10) 

857
00:34:23,776 --> 00:34:25,776
It's light. It's perfect aperitif. 

858
00:34:25,776 --> 00:34:26,776
(Perfect wine for aperitif) 

859
00:34:27,309 --> 00:34:29,542
It's fun to have wine. 

860
00:34:29,542 --> 00:34:32,142
- Going to different regions. / - In Korea, you need... 

861
00:34:32,142 --> 00:34:34,342
To pay $40 or $50 per bottle... 

862
00:34:34,342 --> 00:34:35,876
- If you go to a restaurant. / - Right. 

863
00:34:35,876 --> 00:34:37,076
This is only 17 euros. 

864
00:34:37,076 --> 00:34:38,409
- For one bottle. / - $25. 

865
00:34:38,409 --> 00:34:39,542
(It's nice to be able to enjoy wine without pressure) 

866
00:34:41,576 --> 00:34:44,809
Italian wine doesn't overpower Italian food. 

867
00:34:44,809 --> 00:34:47,176
You can continue to enjoy it with food. 

868
00:34:47,842 --> 00:34:49,476
(The food is here) 

869
00:34:49,476 --> 00:34:50,676
(It makes his jaw drop) 

870
00:34:50,676 --> 00:34:52,542
What did you do? 

871
00:34:52,542 --> 00:34:53,942
It's like we're at a butcher shop. 

872
00:34:53,942 --> 00:34:55,376
Wow. Thank you. 

873
00:34:55,376 --> 00:34:56,642
This looks good. 

874
00:34:56,642 --> 00:34:57,942
Yes, it looks good. I'm drooling. 

875
00:34:57,942 --> 00:34:59,176
But it's so much. 

876
00:35:00,542 --> 00:35:01,809
That ham. 

877
00:35:01,809 --> 00:35:04,276
What? They gave you so much ham. 

878
00:35:04,276 --> 00:35:05,809
It's a ham platter. 

879
00:35:05,809 --> 00:35:06,876
(Salami and mortadella) 

880
00:35:06,876 --> 00:35:08,842
- That was amazing. / - It was only $13. 

881
00:35:08,842 --> 00:35:10,342
It's cheap. 

882
00:35:10,342 --> 00:35:11,842
I want to try that ham. 

883
00:35:11,842 --> 00:35:13,709
Seriously. 

884
00:35:15,542 --> 00:35:16,876
This is salami. 

885
00:35:16,876 --> 00:35:18,476
It's very famous in Italy. 

886
00:35:18,976 --> 00:35:20,909
Salami... 

887
00:35:20,909 --> 00:35:22,142
- Salami picante. / - Picante. 

888
00:35:23,109 --> 00:35:24,709
There's salami. 

889
00:35:24,709 --> 00:35:27,142
(Cured sausage made of fermented meat) 

890
00:35:27,142 --> 00:35:31,842
(Salame Picante is spicy salami) 

891
00:35:32,509 --> 00:35:34,009
(Mortadella is a half-dried sausage made in Bologna) 

892
00:35:34,009 --> 00:35:35,742
- That's the delicious one. / - That one. 

893
00:35:36,176 --> 00:35:39,042
That's the original Bologna sausage. 

894
00:35:39,042 --> 00:35:41,242
It looks like the sausage I had back in the day. 

895
00:35:43,576 --> 00:35:47,042
Spain has jamon and Italy has prosciutto. 

896
00:35:47,809 --> 00:35:50,242
- Prosciutto. / - Mortadella. 

897
00:35:50,242 --> 00:35:51,576
(Mortadella, prosciutto, salami picante, salami) 

898
00:35:51,576 --> 00:35:52,742
Prosciutto. 

899
00:35:52,742 --> 00:35:57,242
(They taste one at a time) 

900
00:35:57,676 --> 00:35:58,742
It's not salty. 

901
00:36:00,609 --> 00:36:02,742
- It's delicious. / - My hands got all greasy. 

902
00:36:03,342 --> 00:36:05,042
- It doesn't taste like salami. / - It's better... 

903
00:36:05,042 --> 00:36:06,842
- To eat them with hands. / - Right. 

904
00:36:06,842 --> 00:36:08,409
Does it taste good without bread? 

905
00:36:08,409 --> 00:36:09,776
Yes, it's not salty. 

906
00:36:09,776 --> 00:36:11,176
(Satisfied) 

907
00:36:11,176 --> 00:36:12,909
Mortadella is famous here. 

908
00:36:12,909 --> 00:36:15,176
(Mortadella is Bologna's typical ham) 

909
00:36:15,176 --> 00:36:16,342
We know the flavor because 

910
00:36:16,342 --> 00:36:17,942
it's sold in department stores now. 

911
00:36:17,942 --> 00:36:20,076
But this is high quality. 

912
00:36:20,076 --> 00:36:21,176
It's moist. 

913
00:36:21,709 --> 00:36:23,842
- They add the innards of the pig. / - Right. 

914
00:36:23,842 --> 00:36:25,509
It's completely ground up. 

915
00:36:25,509 --> 00:36:27,676
- This is less salty... / - Yes. 

916
00:36:27,676 --> 00:36:29,309
Compared to the others. 

917
00:36:29,309 --> 00:36:32,042
This has a short shelf life. You need to eat it quickly. 

918
00:36:32,042 --> 00:36:32,976
(Flavored with ground black pepper and pistachios) 

919
00:36:32,976 --> 00:36:36,009
Salami we had before were 

920
00:36:36,009 --> 00:36:38,276
fermented and air-dried. 

921
00:36:38,276 --> 00:36:40,709
But with this, ground meat is boiled once. 

922
00:36:40,709 --> 00:36:42,476
It's cooled down then cut. 

923
00:36:42,876 --> 00:36:44,876
- That's why it's so tender. / - Yes, it's very tender. 

924
00:36:45,309 --> 00:36:46,809
I'll try it. 

925
00:36:47,809 --> 00:36:50,576
(First, you cut a bun in half) 

926
00:36:50,576 --> 00:36:51,676
Add some olive oil. 

927
00:36:51,676 --> 00:36:53,209
My favorite... 

928
00:36:53,209 --> 00:36:54,642
Mortadella. 

929
00:36:55,109 --> 00:36:56,509
- Mortadella. / - Add this. 

930
00:36:56,509 --> 00:36:57,809
(Add the meat you like) 

931
00:36:58,242 --> 00:36:59,809
Add a bit of black pepper. 

932
00:36:59,809 --> 00:37:02,442
(Add olive oil or black pepper) 

933
00:37:02,442 --> 00:37:03,742
I'm excited. 

934
00:37:04,376 --> 00:37:07,676
When you cut marinated crab in half and eat it whole... 

935
00:37:07,676 --> 00:37:09,309
- That's luxury. / - Yes. 

936
00:37:09,309 --> 00:37:10,442
This is like that. 

937
00:37:11,242 --> 00:37:12,376
Luxury. 

938
00:37:13,842 --> 00:37:15,109
I'm excited. 

939
00:37:15,109 --> 00:37:17,309
It's crunchy. 

940
00:37:21,809 --> 00:37:22,942
It's good. 

941
00:37:24,576 --> 00:37:25,609
Cheers. 

942
00:37:25,609 --> 00:37:28,042
(The taste makes you think of beer) 

943
00:37:28,042 --> 00:37:30,042
- This is how you clink beer? / - Yeah. 

944
00:37:35,209 --> 00:37:37,076
They have various kinds of beer. 

945
00:37:38,742 --> 00:37:41,009
They pressed down on the dough and baked it. 

946
00:37:41,476 --> 00:37:43,642
So the outside is very crisp. 

947
00:37:43,642 --> 00:37:46,142
- That's so delicious. / - The inside is so moist. 

948
00:37:46,142 --> 00:37:47,976
It's really interesting. 

949
00:37:47,976 --> 00:37:51,109
It's kind of like baked Chinese bread. 

950
00:37:51,109 --> 00:37:52,676
It's kind of like sugar stuffed pancakes too. 

951
00:37:52,676 --> 00:37:54,876
- It must be very dense. / - Yes. 

952
00:37:54,876 --> 00:37:56,209
(The rice cake like bread goes well with ham) 

953
00:37:56,209 --> 00:37:59,276
This isn't work for me. I'm so happy. I really like this. 

954
00:37:59,276 --> 00:38:00,776
I can make... 

955
00:38:01,742 --> 00:38:04,109
A sandwich however I like. 

956
00:38:04,709 --> 00:38:06,776
I can have it with my favorite beer and wine. 

957
00:38:08,109 --> 00:38:09,576
That's nice. 

958
00:38:09,576 --> 00:38:11,942
- Wonil, you're giving in. / - Yes. 

959
00:38:11,942 --> 00:38:13,476
This is getting to you. 

960
00:38:13,476 --> 00:38:17,042
This is hard. They're going overboard today. 

961
00:38:17,042 --> 00:38:20,076
Wait. I... I need... 

962
00:38:20,076 --> 00:38:22,109
Excuse me. Oops, what am I saying? 

963
00:38:22,109 --> 00:38:23,609
(Urgent) 

964
00:38:23,609 --> 00:38:24,909
What? 

965
00:38:24,909 --> 00:38:26,042
(What's wrong?) 

966
00:38:26,042 --> 00:38:27,576
I'm going to order this. 

967
00:38:28,309 --> 00:38:30,642
- I want to put just this. / - Really? 

968
00:38:30,642 --> 00:38:33,176
One plate of mortadella. 

969
00:38:33,176 --> 00:38:35,276
- Just mortadella? / - Yes, just mortadella. 

970
00:38:35,276 --> 00:38:36,776
- More? / - Did he order more? 

971
00:38:36,776 --> 00:38:37,976
It's so good. 

972
00:38:39,576 --> 00:38:41,509
- For you, guys. / - Thank you. 

973
00:38:41,509 --> 00:38:43,376
- Enjoy. / - Thank you. 

974
00:38:43,376 --> 00:38:45,209
- Here it is. / - Let's just let go. 

975
00:38:45,209 --> 00:38:46,942
Here it is, here it is. 

976
00:38:47,642 --> 00:38:48,976
- Like this. / - I'm going to get fat. 

977
00:38:48,976 --> 00:38:50,142
(He can't stop smiling) 

978
00:38:50,142 --> 00:38:51,709
Who said Italian food was healthy? 

979
00:38:52,476 --> 00:38:54,676
(What will it taste like?) 

980
00:38:56,042 --> 00:38:57,337
(Battle Trip Part 2 will be aired soon) 

981
00:38:57,758 --> 00:39:00,158
It was so good. I couldn't just eat that little. 

982
00:39:00,158 --> 00:39:01,391
Mortadella. 

983
00:39:01,858 --> 00:39:03,291
Let's just let go. 

984
00:39:03,291 --> 00:39:05,225
He ordered just that. 

985
00:39:05,225 --> 00:39:06,791
- He made up his mind. / - I'm going to get fat. 

986
00:39:06,791 --> 00:39:08,191
(He can't stop smiling) 

987
00:39:08,191 --> 00:39:09,991
Who said Italian food was healthy? 

988
00:39:09,991 --> 00:39:12,158
This is healthy, there's no butter. 

989
00:39:13,891 --> 00:39:15,325
But you used so much olive oil. 

990
00:39:16,525 --> 00:39:19,325
(Sprinkling generously) 

991
00:39:20,025 --> 00:39:21,291
(Adding mortadella on top) 

992
00:39:21,291 --> 00:39:23,025
You've let go. 

993
00:39:23,025 --> 00:39:24,958
- He's let go. / - He wasn't drunk. He just let go. 

994
00:39:24,958 --> 00:39:26,358
How many slices did you add? 

995
00:39:27,191 --> 00:39:29,125
- Did you just add that? / - Yes. 

996
00:39:29,725 --> 00:39:32,191
(It looks so good) 

997
00:39:32,191 --> 00:39:35,525
(The sandwich looks delicious) 

998
00:39:39,591 --> 00:39:41,258
(It's tender) 

999
00:39:41,258 --> 00:39:42,525
It's super tender. 

1000
00:39:43,258 --> 00:39:44,525
You need to add a lot. 

1001
00:39:44,525 --> 00:39:46,358
I told you... 

1002
00:39:46,358 --> 00:39:48,458
- That I was going to cheat today. / - Yes. 

1003
00:39:48,458 --> 00:39:50,258
I'll give you mortadella later. 

1004
00:39:52,058 --> 00:39:53,525
- Thank you. / - He said he prepared those. 

1005
00:39:54,458 --> 00:39:56,725
- The dumpling? / - No. The ham. 

1006
00:39:57,291 --> 00:39:58,425
I don't know what it is 

1007
00:39:58,425 --> 00:40:00,625
but I'll move mortadella up higher. 

1008
00:40:00,625 --> 00:40:03,925
He ordered more because it was so delicious. 

1009
00:40:05,425 --> 00:40:08,491
(Next dish is being served) 

1010
00:40:08,491 --> 00:40:10,291
- Are those dumplings? / - Yes. 

1011
00:40:11,325 --> 00:40:16,691
(Tortellini, $13) 

1012
00:40:16,691 --> 00:40:18,225
The broth is very clear. 

1013
00:40:18,225 --> 00:40:20,325
So it soothes the stomach from a hangover. 

1014
00:40:20,891 --> 00:40:23,958
- What's inside? / - Meat and cheese stuffing. 

1015
00:40:23,958 --> 00:40:26,791
We call this Italian dumpling soup. 

1016
00:40:26,791 --> 00:40:29,558
- But there's a unique difference. / - What's that? 

1017
00:40:29,558 --> 00:40:30,625
(How is it different from Korean dumpling soup?) 

1018
00:40:30,625 --> 00:40:33,125
- The broth is clear. / - Yes. 

1019
00:40:33,125 --> 00:40:34,958
Korean dumpling soup is thick. 

1020
00:40:34,958 --> 00:40:37,858
We add dumplings in the broth and boil them. 

1021
00:40:38,458 --> 00:40:40,358
- They pour it later. / - They boil the dumplings... 

1022
00:40:40,358 --> 00:40:42,258
And pour the broth separately. 

1023
00:40:42,258 --> 00:40:43,525
That's the difference. 

1024
00:40:43,958 --> 00:40:45,625
- I'll try it first. / - Okay. 

1025
00:40:49,891 --> 00:40:51,425
(Yummy) 

1026
00:40:52,625 --> 00:40:54,058
It's Western soup. 

1027
00:40:54,058 --> 00:40:56,358
- This is good. / - It's sweet. 

1028
00:40:56,358 --> 00:40:58,625
What we had earlier was 

1029
00:40:58,625 --> 00:41:00,058
like side dish for the alcohol. 

1030
00:41:00,058 --> 00:41:02,725
- This is like a meal. / - It warms you up. 

1031
00:41:02,725 --> 00:41:04,491
It'll taste good on a rainy day. 

1032
00:41:04,491 --> 00:41:07,758
- Is it cheese inside? / - I think cheese and meat. 

1033
00:41:07,758 --> 00:41:10,325
This is salty for the Korean palate. 

1034
00:41:10,925 --> 00:41:13,325
I've never had tiny dumplings like these. 

1035
00:41:13,325 --> 00:41:15,958
Tortellini. It looks like a belly-button. 

1036
00:41:19,958 --> 00:41:26,925
(They add a little bit of ground black pepper) 

1037
00:41:31,991 --> 00:41:33,958
- It's like fishcake soup. / - Yes. 

1038
00:41:34,791 --> 00:41:36,325
This is the magic of black pepper. 

1039
00:41:36,991 --> 00:41:39,791
People who don't like foreign food... 

1040
00:41:39,791 --> 00:41:41,091
- Will like this. / - Yes. 

1041
00:41:41,658 --> 00:41:43,525
- It feels Korean. / - Right. 

1042
00:41:43,525 --> 00:41:47,058
- With black pepper, it's... / - Even more Korean. 

1043
00:41:47,058 --> 00:41:48,158
That's crazy. 

1044
00:41:48,158 --> 00:41:50,225
- I love soup. / - Yes. 

1045
00:41:58,491 --> 00:41:59,958
(Average score for dinner in Bologna, 4.4 stars) 

1046
00:41:59,958 --> 00:42:02,225
4.4 stars. That's high. 

1047
00:42:02,725 --> 00:42:05,791
With that ham, bread, and wine... 

1048
00:42:05,791 --> 00:42:07,525
I would eat nonstop. 

1049
00:42:08,791 --> 00:42:11,125
- That's undeniable. / - Right. 

1050
00:42:11,125 --> 00:42:13,358
Tomorrow is the last day, isn't it? 

1051
00:42:13,758 --> 00:42:15,758
It is the last day. Time flies. 

1052
00:42:15,758 --> 00:42:17,358
I have like a pimple here. 

1053
00:42:17,358 --> 00:42:20,591
- Why? / - I think I'm tired. I'm so upset. 

1054
00:42:20,591 --> 00:42:21,491
(The body is expressing that it's old) 

1055
00:42:21,491 --> 00:42:24,025
All I had was stamina. 

1056
00:42:25,358 --> 00:42:26,825
Now I have no stamina... 

1057
00:42:28,225 --> 00:42:29,458
No wife. 

1058
00:42:31,525 --> 00:42:36,025
(The night in Bologna feels extra lonely tonight) 

1059
00:42:36,025 --> 00:42:40,458
(The second day in Bologna breaks) 

1060
00:42:41,358 --> 00:42:44,291
(Bologna Centrale) 

1061
00:42:45,325 --> 00:42:48,425
It's the highlight of day 2 in Bologna. 

1062
00:42:48,425 --> 00:42:51,058
We'll go to a balsamic vinegar farm. 

1063
00:42:51,058 --> 00:42:52,391
We'll go to Modena. 

1064
00:42:53,225 --> 00:42:55,058
What's good about Bologna is, 

1065
00:42:55,058 --> 00:42:56,391
if we have enough time there... 

1066
00:42:56,925 --> 00:43:00,125
There is Modena near it. 

1067
00:43:00,125 --> 00:43:02,858
Modena is a place where they produce 

1068
00:43:02,858 --> 00:43:03,791
balsamic vinegar. 

1069
00:43:03,791 --> 00:43:06,491
If we have time, we can drive there 

1070
00:43:06,491 --> 00:43:07,758
or take a train there. 

1071
00:43:08,125 --> 00:43:10,825
We can drive there or take a train there. 

1072
00:43:10,825 --> 00:43:13,358
We can taste great vinegar. 

1073
00:43:13,358 --> 00:43:14,958
How about it? 

1074
00:43:14,958 --> 00:43:16,225
Sounds great. 

1075
00:43:16,225 --> 00:43:18,325
(Mission success!) 

1076
00:43:18,791 --> 00:43:21,391
You can make a tour reservation. 

1077
00:43:22,091 --> 00:43:23,191
Booking. 

1078
00:43:24,058 --> 00:43:26,425
This is very professional. 

1079
00:43:27,525 --> 00:43:28,991
(Balsamic vinegar tour is popular among the locals) 

1080
00:43:28,991 --> 00:43:30,458
That looks like fun. 

1081
00:43:30,458 --> 00:43:32,891
- I learned a lot from that farm. / - Right. 

1082
00:43:32,891 --> 00:43:35,625
There's a balsamic tour. 

1083
00:43:35,625 --> 00:43:38,358
We can rent a car but that's expensive. 

1084
00:43:38,891 --> 00:43:42,025
There is a train every 15 minutes. 

1085
00:43:42,025 --> 00:43:44,091
It takes about 20, 25 minutes. 

1086
00:43:44,091 --> 00:43:47,891
- That's not far. / - Most tourists take the train. 

1087
00:43:47,891 --> 00:43:50,491
True, renting a car is expensive. 

1088
00:43:50,991 --> 00:43:53,391
So we'll take a train. 

1089
00:43:53,958 --> 00:43:55,125
Let's go. 

1090
00:43:56,691 --> 00:43:59,225
(Train from Bologna to Modena, $5) 

1091
00:43:59,225 --> 00:44:04,291
(Aceto balsamico means fragrant vinegar) 

1092
00:44:04,825 --> 00:44:09,391
(It's known for salad dressing) 

1093
00:44:10,258 --> 00:44:14,591
(And it's used for plate decoration) 

1094
00:44:14,591 --> 00:44:19,458
(Balsamic vinegar) 

1095
00:44:19,458 --> 00:44:21,458
(Even a few drops are enough to change the flavor) 

1096
00:44:21,458 --> 00:44:24,658
It's amazing, adding a few drops in risotto. 

1097
00:44:24,658 --> 00:44:28,291
(The ingredient itself makes it real gourmet) 

1098
00:44:29,225 --> 00:44:33,925

(Balsamic vinegar farm) 

1103
00:44:48,758 --> 00:44:50,058
- We're in Modena. / - Yes. 

1104
00:44:50,658 --> 00:44:53,791
Don't you smell it already? 

1105
00:44:53,791 --> 00:44:55,525
Yes, it has that sour smell. 

1106
00:44:57,425 --> 00:44:59,791
Unfortunately, the harvesting season is over. 

1107
00:44:59,791 --> 00:45:01,158
We can't see the grapes. 

1108
00:45:01,158 --> 00:45:04,258
They produce grapes themselves 

1109
00:45:04,258 --> 00:45:05,425
and make vinegar. 

1110
00:45:07,325 --> 00:45:12,158
(Oak barrels that have been used since 1512) 

1111
00:45:12,958 --> 00:45:13,791
(There's Pierce Brosnan's personal balsamic vinegar) 

1112
00:45:13,791 --> 00:45:16,125
Pierce Brosnan loved it so much 

1113
00:45:16,125 --> 00:45:17,758
that he has his own barrel. 

1114
00:45:17,758 --> 00:45:19,925
- Oh, my. / - There's also Mark Zuckerberg. 

1115
00:45:19,925 --> 00:45:21,858
It's not a winery but "balsaminery." 

1116
00:45:22,891 --> 00:45:24,891
- It's similar to maturing wine. / - Yes. 

1117
00:45:26,125 --> 00:45:27,525
Is that him over there? 

1118
00:45:28,491 --> 00:45:30,558
- Hello. / - Hello. 

1119
00:45:30,558 --> 00:45:32,558
- Nice to meet you. Hi. / - You too. 

1120
00:45:32,558 --> 00:45:34,658
- Thank you. / - So, this is your farm? 

1121
00:45:34,658 --> 00:45:35,658
This is my farm. 

1122
00:45:35,658 --> 00:45:37,458
- He was very kind. / - We make... 

1123
00:45:37,458 --> 00:45:39,858
Traditional balsamic vinegar here. 

1124
00:45:39,858 --> 00:45:41,958
- Pleasure to meet you. / - Okay.

(Balsamic vinegar farm tour, $13 per person) 

1126
00:45:43,925 --> 00:45:46,291
You can apply for a tour on their homepage, 

1127
00:45:46,291 --> 00:45:49,058
and it's only 10 euros per person. 

1128
00:45:49,058 --> 00:45:50,458
- Wine? / - That's grape juice. 

1129
00:45:50,458 --> 00:45:52,625
It was sour down there 

1130
00:45:52,625 --> 00:45:54,291
but it smells sweeter as we go up. 

1131
00:45:55,958 --> 00:45:58,658
It smells like sherry wine. 

1132
00:45:59,125 --> 00:46:03,491
(What kind of place is this?) 

1133
00:46:03,491 --> 00:46:04,691
It smells very nice.

(Balsamic vinegar maturing cellar) 

1135
00:46:06,491 --> 00:46:08,858
- It smells really nice. / - It smells very sweet. 

1136
00:46:12,025 --> 00:46:13,058
Good. 

1137
00:46:13,058 --> 00:46:17,125
(It's obvious that these barrels are very old) 

1138
00:46:17,658 --> 00:46:19,491
For this production, 

1139
00:46:19,491 --> 00:46:24,125
they cut the grapes, pressed, squeeze out the juice. 

1140
00:46:24,125 --> 00:46:26,791
The only white grape I can use is Trebbiano. 

1141
00:46:26,791 --> 00:46:28,691
- Trebbiano. / - It's a kind of grape. 

1142
00:46:28,691 --> 00:46:30,991
For red, only Lambrusco. 

1143
00:46:30,991 --> 00:46:33,658
Then the juice is cooked for about... 

1144
00:46:33,658 --> 00:46:36,958
The only difference from wine is that it's boiled once. 

1145
00:46:36,958 --> 00:46:38,358
It's boiled down. 

1146
00:46:38,358 --> 00:46:41,958
You put the juice in the barrel. 

1147
00:46:41,958 --> 00:46:44,225
(Pour boiled grape juice in the barrel and mature) 

1148
00:46:44,225 --> 00:46:46,725
And through an observation process, 

1149
00:46:46,725 --> 00:46:48,691
the cooked juice is transformed 

1150
00:46:48,691 --> 00:46:50,658
into traditional balsamic vinegar. 

1151
00:46:50,658 --> 00:46:52,091
It's important... 

1152
00:46:52,091 --> 00:46:55,025
- In Korea... / - We just use it. 

1153
00:46:55,025 --> 00:46:57,858
Koreans often use balsamic vinegar even at home. 

1154
00:46:57,858 --> 00:47:00,525
You need to know the definition. 

1155
00:47:00,525 --> 00:47:03,725
When we say balsamic vinegar in Korea, 

1156
00:47:03,725 --> 00:47:06,991
people think it's a high quality wine vinegar. 

1157
00:47:06,991 --> 00:47:09,191
But wine vinegar and balsamic vinegar 

1158
00:47:09,191 --> 00:47:10,158
are two different things. 

1159
00:47:10,158 --> 00:47:12,158
Wine vinegar is made of wine. 

1160
00:47:12,158 --> 00:47:13,991
You make wine from grape juice 

1161
00:47:13,991 --> 00:47:15,491
and use that to make vinegar. 

1162
00:47:15,491 --> 00:47:16,691
That's wine vinegar. 

1163
00:47:16,691 --> 00:47:19,358
(How to make wine vinegar) 

1164
00:47:19,358 --> 00:47:21,825
Harvest grapes, boil grape juice 

1165
00:47:21,825 --> 00:47:24,425
and use that to make balsamic vinegar. 

1166
00:47:25,958 --> 00:47:27,525
It's made straight from grape. 

1167
00:47:27,525 --> 00:47:29,325
You take a long time 

1168
00:47:29,325 --> 00:47:33,058
to get the result solely from grape juice. 

1169
00:47:33,058 --> 00:47:34,091
That's balsamic vinegar. 

1170
00:47:34,091 --> 00:47:39,225
Aceto Balsamico Tradizionale. 

1171
00:47:39,225 --> 00:47:42,991
This started in 1998. 

1172
00:47:42,991 --> 00:47:44,291
It was even before my debut. 

1173
00:47:44,725 --> 00:47:47,058
When SHINHWA debuted, 

1174
00:47:47,058 --> 00:47:48,558
it began. 

1175
00:47:48,558 --> 00:47:50,958
What's the difference between the sizes? 

1176
00:47:50,958 --> 00:47:54,558
This set is called batterie. 

1177
00:47:55,291 --> 00:48:01,791
(Several barrels in a set for maturing balsamic vinegar) 

1178
00:48:01,991 --> 00:48:04,491
The small ones are always the older. 

1179
00:48:04,491 --> 00:48:05,791
Oh, they keep moving. 

1180
00:48:05,791 --> 00:48:07,258
It's all done manually. 

1181
00:48:07,258 --> 00:48:09,625
The bigger, the younger and smaller ones are older 

1182
00:48:09,625 --> 00:48:11,291
because the quantity reduces. 

1183
00:48:11,291 --> 00:48:14,691
(The oldest vinegar remains in the smallest barrel) 

1184
00:48:14,691 --> 00:48:16,991
Each year, I move a little quantity of product 

1185
00:48:16,991 --> 00:48:18,891
from one barrel to another barrel. 

1186
00:48:18,891 --> 00:48:22,091
- And it takes 12 years. / - So much work. 

1187
00:48:22,091 --> 00:48:25,358
But we must wait minimum of 12 years. 

1188
00:48:25,791 --> 00:48:27,191
- 12 years? / - It's 12 years minimum. 

1189
00:48:27,191 --> 00:48:29,058
We must wait minimum of 12 years 

1190
00:48:29,058 --> 00:48:30,591
for traditional balsamic vinegar. 

1191
00:48:30,591 --> 00:48:32,625
It's matured for 12 years? 

1192
00:48:32,625 --> 00:48:35,491
Balsamic vinegar can get super expensive. 

1193
00:48:35,491 --> 00:48:36,991
- It's very expensive. / - Yes. 

1194
00:48:36,991 --> 00:48:40,191
It's like whiskey, right? 

1195
00:48:40,191 --> 00:48:43,291
- Whiskey also... / - They reduce. 

1196
00:48:43,291 --> 00:48:45,758
- But in this one, no alcohol. / - No alcohol. 

1197
00:48:45,758 --> 00:48:47,691
This isn't alcohol though. 

1198
00:48:47,691 --> 00:48:49,658
The barrels are always open. 

1199
00:48:50,891 --> 00:48:54,925
(There's a white cloth on top of every barrel) 

1200
00:48:54,925 --> 00:48:56,625
As it matures, 

1201
00:48:56,625 --> 00:48:59,425
it shouldn't contain alcohol. 

1202
00:48:59,425 --> 00:49:01,891
So they leave the cap open to evaporate the alcohol. 

1203
00:49:01,891 --> 00:49:05,025
As moisture evaporates, the flavor condenses. 

1204
00:49:05,025 --> 00:49:06,391
That's how the process works. 

1205
00:49:06,391 --> 00:49:08,058
And for the wine production, 

1206
00:49:08,058 --> 00:49:10,658
the wooden barrels are always closed. 

1207
00:49:10,658 --> 00:49:13,058
(Alcohol evaporates and moisture condenses) 

1208
00:49:13,358 --> 00:49:14,925
- Now I'll show you. / - Okay. 

1209
00:49:15,791 --> 00:49:16,825
Oh, really? 

1210
00:49:18,025 --> 00:49:19,991
It's all moved manually using that. 

1211
00:49:19,991 --> 00:49:20,991
(Every process is done manually) 

1212
00:49:22,625 --> 00:49:26,491
So, every process follows the traditional way. 

1213
00:49:26,491 --> 00:49:27,925
(Meeting traditional balsamic vinegar) 

1214
00:49:27,925 --> 00:49:29,491
It's almost like honey. 

1215
00:49:29,491 --> 00:49:30,725
It's like grain syrup. 

1216
00:49:30,725 --> 00:49:32,925
Right. It's as thick as grain syrup. 

1217
00:49:33,591 --> 00:49:34,791
Sticky. 

1218
00:49:34,791 --> 00:49:37,991
(It's thick even to the naked eye) 

1219
00:49:37,991 --> 00:49:39,858
Isn't that an appetizing density? 

1220
00:49:39,858 --> 00:49:41,958
I just want to dip my finger to taste it. 

1221
00:49:41,958 --> 00:49:42,958
Yes. 

1222
00:49:42,958 --> 00:49:43,991
(Off they go to taste traditional balsamic vinegar) 

1223
00:49:43,991 --> 00:49:45,291
It's a tasting area. 

1224
00:49:46,758 --> 00:49:47,891
This is the product? 

1225
00:49:47,891 --> 00:49:50,125
These are the products. 

1226
00:49:50,125 --> 00:49:53,858
Very important for the traditional balsamic vinegar 

1227
00:49:53,858 --> 00:49:55,391
to have this kind of bottle. 

1228
00:49:55,391 --> 00:49:56,391
The shape of the bottle. 

1229
00:49:56,391 --> 00:49:57,991
The shape of the bottle matters 

1230
00:49:57,991 --> 00:49:59,058
for the traditional balsamic vinegar. 

1231
00:49:59,058 --> 00:50:03,325
As for traditional Modena balsamic vinegar, 

1232
00:50:03,325 --> 00:50:05,858
it has absolutely no additives and that's the shape. 

1233
00:50:05,858 --> 00:50:07,891
Only the balsamic vinegar in that type of bottle 

1234
00:50:07,891 --> 00:50:09,625
is traditionally made. 

1235
00:50:11,825 --> 00:50:16,125
"Aceto Balsamico Tradizionale." This is what matters. 

1236
00:50:16,325 --> 00:50:18,358
When you look here, 

1237
00:50:18,358 --> 00:50:20,325
only the ones with no additives are authentic. 

1238
00:50:20,325 --> 00:50:21,558
(It's a government certified mark) 

1239
00:50:21,558 --> 00:50:22,258
Here. 

1240
00:50:22,958 --> 00:50:24,758
- Spoon. / - Thank you. 

1241
00:50:24,758 --> 00:50:26,225
(It's finally time to try balsamic vinegar) 

1242
00:50:26,658 --> 00:50:28,658
First of all, balsamic vinegar. 

1243
00:50:28,658 --> 00:50:29,991
(A regular store product with artificial additives) 

1244
00:50:29,991 --> 00:50:33,058
This one is made with 65% vinegar. 

1245
00:50:33,058 --> 00:50:34,058
65%. 

1246
00:50:34,058 --> 00:50:35,658
(It's clearly watery) 

1247
00:50:37,325 --> 00:50:39,025
Good for salad if you want. 

1248
00:50:39,825 --> 00:50:41,391
Or if you're cooking. 

1249
00:50:41,391 --> 00:50:45,025
- It's good but sour. / - It's light... 

1250
00:50:45,025 --> 00:50:46,291
For salad. 

1251
00:50:46,291 --> 00:50:48,191
It's the traditional method but young. 

1252
00:50:48,191 --> 00:50:50,091
- 6 years old. / - It's 6 years old. 

1253
00:50:50,091 --> 00:50:51,291
(You can see 6-year-old balsamic vinegar is thicker) 

1254
00:50:51,291 --> 00:50:53,191
- In this case the juice is... / - It's thicker. 

1255
00:50:53,191 --> 00:50:56,325
Cooked a little bit more. 30 hours instead of 24. 

1256
00:50:56,325 --> 00:50:58,691
(How does 6-year-old balsamic vinegar taste?) 

1257
00:50:58,691 --> 00:51:00,791
Since it's been matured for a while, 

1258
00:51:00,791 --> 00:51:04,125
the scent from oak barrel controls the sour taste. 

1259
00:51:04,125 --> 00:51:05,625
Also, it's a bit thicker. 

1260
00:51:05,625 --> 00:51:06,758
Because we talked about grain syrup, 

1261
00:51:06,758 --> 00:51:07,958
it tastes like grain syrup. 

1262
00:51:07,958 --> 00:51:09,158
Yes, it's like grain syrup. 

1263
00:51:09,158 --> 00:51:11,091
(6-year-old balsamic vinegar) 

1264
00:51:11,091 --> 00:51:12,558
And this is white grape. 

1265
00:51:12,558 --> 00:51:14,025
It's already thick. 

1266
00:51:14,025 --> 00:51:16,158
- It's sticky. / - It's made of white grape. 

1267
00:51:16,158 --> 00:51:20,591
The white label means it's 12 years old. 

1268
00:51:25,258 --> 00:51:27,358
(Wow) 

1269
00:51:27,591 --> 00:51:30,925
Whiskey and wine are funny. 

1270
00:51:30,925 --> 00:51:33,391
The more you pay, the better whiskey tastes. 

1271
00:51:36,158 --> 00:51:37,591
- Really? / - I'm serious. 

1272
00:51:37,591 --> 00:51:38,558
Really? 

1273
00:51:39,158 --> 00:51:41,691
Unless you pay more, it can't be good. 

1274
00:51:42,425 --> 00:51:44,125
The more you pay, the better it is. 

1275
00:51:44,125 --> 00:51:49,558
(12-year-old balsamic vinegar) 

1276
00:51:49,558 --> 00:51:50,891
Minimum 25. 

1277
00:51:50,891 --> 00:51:52,191
(Traditional balsamic vinegar matured for over 25 years) 

1278
00:51:53,591 --> 00:51:55,158
- So this is... / - This is gold label? 

1279
00:51:55,158 --> 00:51:58,058
- The gold. / - Yes, the gold. 

1280
00:51:58,058 --> 00:52:01,125
(The thicker, the slower) 

1281
00:52:02,591 --> 00:52:04,691
(He sniffs first, then tastes) 

1282
00:52:04,691 --> 00:52:05,758
Okay. 

1283
00:52:06,925 --> 00:52:10,391
(Very thick) 

1284
00:52:11,858 --> 00:52:14,058
It must be really good. 

1285
00:52:14,058 --> 00:52:16,891
Those lips are so annoying. 

1286
00:52:16,891 --> 00:52:18,825
The stickiness spreads in my mouth, 

1287
00:52:18,825 --> 00:52:21,891
and the smell comes out of my nose. 

1288
00:52:21,891 --> 00:52:23,258
It was so thick. 

1289
00:52:23,258 --> 00:52:27,991
(6 years old, 12 years old, 25 years old) 

1290
00:52:27,991 --> 00:52:29,025
(Sticky) 

1291
00:52:29,025 --> 00:52:30,491
It's thick. 

1292
00:52:31,091 --> 00:52:33,425
100-year-old will be even thicker. 

1293
00:52:34,991 --> 00:52:36,458
(Stickiness, scent, sourness) 

1294
00:52:36,458 --> 00:52:39,491
The sour taste keeps reducing. 

1295
00:52:42,425 --> 00:52:43,125
(Exclaiming) 

1296
00:52:43,125 --> 00:52:45,291
- Gelato. / - Okay. 

1297
00:52:45,291 --> 00:52:48,425
- Gelato. This is frozen ice cream. / - Gelato. 

1298
00:52:48,425 --> 00:52:50,625
With 6-year-old balsamic. 

1299
00:52:50,625 --> 00:52:52,425
(Another way to enjoy balsamic vinegar) 

1300
00:52:52,425 --> 00:52:53,725
Isn't that what we had before? 

1301
00:52:54,625 --> 00:52:56,491
For us, it's a nice combination. 

1302
00:52:56,491 --> 00:52:58,891
They put 100% milk ice cream 

1303
00:52:58,891 --> 00:53:00,258
and 6-year-old balsamic vinegar on it. 

1304
00:53:00,258 --> 00:53:04,391
The sourness will go well with sweet ice cream. 

1305
00:53:05,258 --> 00:53:06,391
This is my first bite. 

1306
00:53:06,391 --> 00:53:09,591
(How does it taste together?) 

1307
00:53:10,825 --> 00:53:15,325
(It's amazing) 

1308
00:53:16,125 --> 00:53:18,791
(Thumbs up) 

1309
00:53:18,791 --> 00:53:19,758
- Very good. / - First? 

1310
00:53:20,558 --> 00:53:21,525
At first, it's too sour 

1311
00:53:21,525 --> 00:53:23,391
and you think they don't go together 

1312
00:53:23,391 --> 00:53:26,558
but then it's sweet. And the scent! 

1313
00:53:27,358 --> 00:53:29,091
You know, you add chocolate or caramel syrup 

1314
00:53:29,091 --> 00:53:30,058
in vanilla ice cream? 

1315
00:53:30,558 --> 00:53:32,491
It looks and tastes like that. 

1316
00:53:32,491 --> 00:53:36,191
It's just that it's sour from grape. 

1317
00:53:36,191 --> 00:53:37,125
It's perfect. 

1318
00:53:37,125 --> 00:53:40,925
If you add it in salty food, 

1319
00:53:40,925 --> 00:53:42,758
the sourness 

1320
00:53:42,758 --> 00:53:44,491
enhances the salty flavor. 

1321
00:53:44,491 --> 00:53:46,925
However, when it's added in ice cream, 

1322
00:53:46,925 --> 00:53:49,458
the sweet flavor and caramel scent add up... 

1323
00:53:49,458 --> 00:53:51,425
- Yes. / - And enhance the sweet flavor. 

1324
00:53:51,425 --> 00:53:53,291
I told you. It tasted like caramel. 

1325
00:53:53,291 --> 00:53:54,391
Right. 

1326
00:53:57,558 --> 00:54:01,091
Chef Lee Wonil seems like giving up. 

1327
00:54:02,158 --> 00:54:04,991
If you can get original balsamic vinegar, 

1328
00:54:04,991 --> 00:54:06,958
it'll hold its own flavor 

1329
00:54:06,958 --> 00:54:08,225
with any kind of ice cream. 

1330
00:54:08,225 --> 00:54:09,825
You should try it at home. 

1331
00:54:10,558 --> 00:54:11,625
This is really good. 

1332
00:54:13,258 --> 00:54:15,291
- The balsamic is so good. / - This is classy. 

1333
00:54:16,291 --> 00:54:17,458
It's not just sweet and sour. 

1334
00:54:18,258 --> 00:54:21,325
It has sour and sweet and aromatic. 

1335
00:54:21,325 --> 00:54:24,658
It has the taste of grape and caramel. 

1336
00:54:24,658 --> 00:54:25,691
It is very harmonious. 

1337
00:54:26,125 --> 00:54:28,591
But we can't go back only after this. 

1338
00:54:28,591 --> 00:54:30,191
We've come all the way here 

1339
00:54:30,191 --> 00:54:31,091
to Modena. 

1340
00:54:31,091 --> 00:54:32,191
In Modena, 

1341
00:54:32,191 --> 00:54:35,958
there's a restaurant where they use 

1342
00:54:35,958 --> 00:54:37,558
the balsamic vinegar of Modena. 

1343
00:54:37,558 --> 00:54:40,391
I heard the place is very famous here. 

1344
00:54:40,391 --> 00:54:42,491
We will go there and have balsamic risotto. 

1345
00:54:42,491 --> 00:54:43,291
You've never heard of it before, right? 

1346
00:54:45,691 --> 00:54:47,891
Balsamic risotto? That sounds strange. 

1347
00:54:47,891 --> 00:54:48,925
I haven't tried it before. 

1348
00:54:48,925 --> 00:54:51,058
Sweet and sour risotto? It doesn't sound good. 

1349
00:54:51,058 --> 00:54:52,758
Actually, the ice cream didn't sound good either. 

1350
00:54:52,758 --> 00:54:54,491
Ice cream is sweet though. 

1351
00:54:55,958 --> 00:54:57,758
But people say it's good. 

1352
00:54:57,758 --> 00:54:58,625
It gets good reviews. 

1353
00:54:59,358 --> 00:55:01,725
Alright then. Let's go try 

1354
00:55:01,725 --> 00:55:02,858
balsamic risotto. 

1355
00:55:02,858 --> 00:55:04,558
- Let's try. / - Let's go. 

1356
00:55:04,991 --> 00:55:06,158
Aren't you buying balsamic vinegar? 

1357
00:55:06,158 --> 00:55:07,225
I'm buying it now. 

1358
00:55:07,625 --> 00:55:08,658
They have to buy it. 

1359
00:55:08,658 --> 00:55:14,758
(20 minutes to the restaurant by taxi) 

1360
00:55:14,758 --> 00:55:16,991
This is the dish that will mark... 

1361
00:55:18,158 --> 00:55:19,591
The end of our trip in Italy. 

1362
00:55:19,591 --> 00:55:20,958
The best restaurant. 

1363
00:55:20,958 --> 00:55:21,991
Isn't this romantic? 

1364
00:55:23,091 --> 00:55:24,825
Right, it looks amazing. 

1365
00:55:24,825 --> 00:55:27,525
- It looks beautiful. / - Because of the wood fire. 

1366
00:55:27,525 --> 00:55:30,025
I heard they have dishes that are not on the menu. 

1367
00:55:30,025 --> 00:55:32,525
Basic dishes like risotto and pasta 

1368
00:55:32,525 --> 00:55:34,225
are not on the menu. 

1369
00:55:34,225 --> 00:55:37,558
We can just order off the menu. 

1370
00:55:37,558 --> 00:55:38,858
- In Italy? / - Yes. 

1371
00:55:38,858 --> 00:55:40,458
We rarely do that. 

1372
00:55:40,458 --> 00:55:41,625
We don't order dishes that aren't on the menu 

1373
00:55:41,625 --> 00:55:42,858
unless we're regulars. 

1374
00:55:43,458 --> 00:55:45,691
People don't like it in Korea. 

1375
00:55:45,691 --> 00:55:47,358
But they have this culture in Italy. 

1376
00:55:47,358 --> 00:55:49,791
The thing people usually eat here is 

1377
00:55:49,791 --> 00:55:51,125
balsamic risotto. 

1378
00:55:51,125 --> 00:55:52,825
Since this is our last day, we should have pasta. 

1379
00:55:52,825 --> 00:55:53,991
Pasta? 

1380
00:55:55,758 --> 00:55:57,325
It's coming. 

1381
00:55:57,325 --> 00:56:00,091
(Amazed) 

1382
00:56:03,358 --> 00:56:06,991
(The climactic last dinner of their trip) 

1383
00:56:08,325 --> 00:56:10,125
- I can't believe this. / - Gosh, what's that? 

1384
00:56:10,125 --> 00:56:11,725
(Gnocco fritto) 

1385
00:56:11,725 --> 00:56:12,891
Truffle pasta. 

1386
00:56:12,891 --> 00:56:14,125
- That's it. / - My gosh. 

1387
00:56:14,125 --> 00:56:15,191
It looks great. 

1388
00:56:15,191 --> 00:56:18,258
(Balsamic risotto) 

1389
00:56:18,258 --> 00:56:20,558
(Steak) 

1390
00:56:21,458 --> 00:56:23,291
It's finally here. Steak. 

1391
00:56:23,291 --> 00:56:24,558
My goodness. 

1392
00:56:24,558 --> 00:56:25,858
What's that steak? 

1393
00:56:27,158 --> 00:56:29,925
(Steak) 

1394
00:56:29,925 --> 00:56:30,958
(Four kinds of dessert) 

1395
00:56:30,958 --> 00:56:32,158
What's that? It's a dessert. 

1396
00:56:32,158 --> 00:56:33,258
They serve dessert. 

1397
00:56:34,825 --> 00:56:38,791
(They complete their order for the last dinner) 

1398
00:56:38,791 --> 00:56:40,358
You guys really did let go of yourselves. 

1399
00:56:41,058 --> 00:56:41,891
Completely. 

1400
00:56:41,891 --> 00:56:45,525
(Is team Spain giving up like this?) 

1401
00:56:49,125 --> 00:56:51,125
(A refreshing start with white wine) 

1402
00:56:51,125 --> 00:56:52,025
Ladies first. 

1403
00:56:55,858 --> 00:56:57,791
- The wine was really good. / - This is our last dinner. 

1404
00:56:57,791 --> 00:56:58,691
It was really good. 

1405
00:56:59,525 --> 00:57:00,758
- It looks delicious. / - It has to be good. 

1406
00:57:02,825 --> 00:57:04,891
(Cheers) 

1407
00:57:04,891 --> 00:57:05,925
It sounds like a cathedral. 

1408
00:57:07,258 --> 00:57:09,491
(Sipping) 

1409
00:57:11,991 --> 00:57:13,058
This is so good. 

1410
00:57:13,558 --> 00:57:14,658
It's delicious. 

1411
00:57:14,658 --> 00:57:15,658
This is great. 

1412
00:57:16,291 --> 00:57:18,091
As I sip it, 

1413
00:57:18,091 --> 00:57:21,725
it feels like a cold and clear rock on my tongue. 

1414
00:57:21,725 --> 00:57:23,358
It feels clear and cool. 

1415
00:57:24,058 --> 00:57:27,491
It's called minerality. 

1416
00:57:27,491 --> 00:57:29,125
And if you smell it... 

1417
00:57:29,691 --> 00:57:31,725
You can feel the almond flavor. 

1418
00:57:31,725 --> 00:57:33,125
It smells like apricot seed. 

1419
00:57:33,125 --> 00:57:34,825
I can feel it. 

1420
00:57:34,825 --> 00:57:37,291
It's quite dry, 

1421
00:57:37,291 --> 00:57:38,525
cool and clear. 

1422
00:57:38,525 --> 00:57:39,758
It stimulates your appetite. 

1423
00:57:39,758 --> 00:57:41,491
(It's perfect for aperitif) 

1424
00:57:41,491 --> 00:57:43,525
Those who like wine will love that. 

1425
00:57:43,525 --> 00:57:44,891
I should go to the restaurant. 

1426
00:57:44,891 --> 00:57:47,091
I really want to go there. 

1427
00:57:47,091 --> 00:57:49,858
(The antipasto is served) 

1428
00:57:49,858 --> 00:57:52,525
- Gnocco fritto. / - Gnocco fritto. 

1429
00:57:52,525 --> 00:57:54,591
Some kind of gnocco fritto. 

1430
00:57:54,591 --> 00:57:56,725
It's like an Italian dumpling. 

1431
00:57:57,125 --> 00:57:59,391
I thought it was boiled but it's actually deep-fried. 

1432
00:58:00,325 --> 00:58:01,525
It's like a fried dumpling. 

1433
00:58:02,591 --> 00:58:04,891
It smells like sweet and sour pork because of vinegar. 

1434
00:58:05,225 --> 00:58:06,891
It smells just like sweet and sour pork. 

1435
00:58:09,591 --> 00:58:10,791
It smells like a Chinese dish. 

1436
00:58:15,425 --> 00:58:17,425
(He keeps making nasal sounds) 

1437
00:58:17,425 --> 00:58:18,891
This is an appetizer. 

1438
00:58:19,625 --> 00:58:20,891
It's salty 

1439
00:58:20,891 --> 00:58:22,191
and the balsamic is sour. 

1440
00:58:22,991 --> 00:58:25,258
So it really increases your appetite. 

1441
00:58:25,258 --> 00:58:26,558
(A fantastic harmony of saltiness and sourness) 

1442
00:58:26,558 --> 00:58:28,791
I've never seen such food before. 

1443
00:58:28,791 --> 00:58:30,158
What's in it? 

1444
00:58:30,158 --> 00:58:32,558
(Parmesan cheese is hidden in the dough) 

1445
00:58:33,291 --> 00:58:35,691
It doesn't feel like an appetizer. It's like a main dish. 

1446
00:58:36,458 --> 00:58:38,458
(He strongly agrees) 

1447
00:58:38,458 --> 00:58:39,825
How can we beat this? 

1448
00:58:39,825 --> 00:58:41,658
This is too good. 

1449
00:58:43,358 --> 00:58:45,525
There's nothing to get rid of. 

1450
00:58:45,525 --> 00:58:47,058
I guess he is grinding it here. 

1451
00:58:47,058 --> 00:58:47,991
(Truffle pasta) 

1452
00:58:47,991 --> 00:58:50,125
They grind truffle like that. 

1453
00:58:50,125 --> 00:58:51,158
Is it truffle? 

1454
00:58:51,158 --> 00:58:52,991
- They give you so much. / - It's expensive. 

1455
00:58:53,391 --> 00:58:56,225
It's called truffle. 

1456
00:58:56,225 --> 00:58:58,291
As I said, it smells like musk. 

1457
00:58:58,291 --> 00:59:00,291
It's one of the three great delicacies of the world. 

1458
00:59:00,291 --> 00:59:01,325
It's truffle. 

1459
00:59:01,325 --> 00:59:02,558
It's expensive. 

1460
00:59:02,558 --> 00:59:04,725
(Truffle pasta, $20.80) 

1461
00:59:06,191 --> 00:59:08,458
- Is that true? / - It's about $20. 

1462
00:59:08,458 --> 00:59:09,725
- It has this much truffle on it. / - It's going down. 

1463
00:59:09,725 --> 00:59:11,125
Oh, no. 

1464
00:59:11,791 --> 00:59:13,191
Falling down. 

1465
00:59:13,191 --> 00:59:14,525
They're eating. 

1466
00:59:14,525 --> 00:59:16,825
They should go down. 

1467
00:59:16,825 --> 00:59:19,658
(Truffle pasta, $20.80) 

1468
00:59:19,658 --> 00:59:23,025
Truffle is called tartufo in Italian. 

1469
00:59:23,525 --> 00:59:24,925
That's truffle. 

1470
00:59:27,425 --> 00:59:31,591
(It makes him take pictures of it) 

1471
00:59:32,825 --> 00:59:35,158
(Deeply moved) 

1472
00:59:35,158 --> 00:59:36,425
What should we do? 

1473
00:59:36,425 --> 00:59:37,425
It smells so good. 

1474
00:59:37,425 --> 00:59:40,525
The world's best truffle is produced 

1475
00:59:40,525 --> 00:59:43,025
in South West France and here. 

1476
00:59:44,991 --> 00:59:46,125
(He tastes it reverently) 

1477
00:59:46,125 --> 00:59:48,258
- It looks so good. / - Look at the pasta. 

1478
00:59:48,258 --> 00:59:49,925
The pasta looks so good. 

1479
00:59:50,425 --> 00:59:51,791
It must be delicious. 

1480
00:59:53,658 --> 00:59:54,558
Wow. 

1481
00:59:56,058 --> 00:59:57,325
It's good. 

1482
00:59:57,325 --> 01:00:01,025
It tastes like the pasta has a lot of egg in it. 

1483
01:00:01,558 --> 01:00:03,091
The scent of egg is very strong. 

1484
01:00:03,425 --> 01:00:07,125
It was like chewy egg yolk garnish. 

1485
01:00:07,125 --> 01:00:07,958
It looks so fresh. 

1486
01:00:07,958 --> 01:00:10,125
The truffle is... 

1487
01:00:10,658 --> 01:00:12,591
Just like a good supporting actor. 

1488
01:00:12,591 --> 01:00:14,125
I can't believe that. 

1489
01:00:14,125 --> 01:00:16,825
The pasta is the main here and they never miss that. 

1490
01:00:16,825 --> 01:00:19,091
- Exactly. / - When Korean people eat meat... 

1491
01:00:19,091 --> 01:00:20,791
They don't like it if rice doesn't taste good. 

1492
01:00:20,791 --> 01:00:22,858
- It's the same. / - You're right about that. 

1493
01:00:22,858 --> 01:00:25,425
It feels like I'm eating very good rice right now. 

1494
01:00:25,425 --> 01:00:26,725
The pasta is very important. 

1495
01:00:26,725 --> 01:00:27,825
I love fresh pasta. 

1496
01:00:29,191 --> 01:00:32,391
(They add some olive oil to it) 

1497
01:00:32,391 --> 01:00:33,658
Alright. 

1498
01:00:34,158 --> 01:00:36,391
This is ragu pasta with truffle... 

1499
01:00:36,891 --> 01:00:38,558
Parmesan cheese 

1500
01:00:38,558 --> 01:00:39,791
and olive oil. 

1501
01:00:41,125 --> 01:00:43,625
Gosh, nothing can beat this. 

1502
01:00:44,291 --> 01:00:45,225
It's good. 

1503
01:00:45,225 --> 01:00:49,691
(This is it) 

1504
01:00:50,725 --> 01:00:52,725
I miss my parents a little bit. 

1505
01:00:53,725 --> 01:00:55,758
When you eat something good... 

1506
01:00:55,758 --> 01:00:57,425
- You think of your parents. / - It was so good. 

1507
01:00:57,425 --> 01:00:59,291
So I wanted my parents to taste it. 

1508
01:01:00,258 --> 01:01:01,758
- It was that good. / - This is the best. 

1509
01:01:02,625 --> 01:01:03,658
This is the best dish. 

1510
01:01:03,658 --> 01:01:07,725
(It's the best dish that makes you miss your parents) 

1511
01:01:09,491 --> 01:01:12,491
(The next dish is served) 

1512
01:01:12,491 --> 01:01:13,891
And this is so... 

1513
01:01:13,891 --> 01:01:16,058
I'm sorry to say this but it's a headache. 

1514
01:01:16,058 --> 01:01:18,125
(What kind of dish is it?) 

1515
01:01:22,458 --> 01:01:24,825
- What is he doing now? / - Wow. 

1516
01:01:25,125 --> 01:01:26,191
Thank you. 

1517
01:01:27,025 --> 01:01:29,058
- Oh, it's risotto. / - Is it risotto? 

1518
01:01:29,625 --> 01:01:31,091
It looks good. 

1519
01:01:31,091 --> 01:01:32,958
This is just amazing. 

1520
01:01:33,391 --> 01:01:38,125
(Balsamic risotto, only in Modena) 

1521
01:01:38,625 --> 01:01:40,658
Made with broth and parmesan cheese. 

1522
01:01:40,658 --> 01:01:43,425
(It's basic risotto made with broth, butter and cheese) 

1523
01:01:43,425 --> 01:01:46,558
(It's completed with Modena's balsamic vinegar) 

1524
01:01:46,558 --> 01:01:48,125
With traditional balsamic vinegar. 

1525
01:01:48,125 --> 01:01:50,025
It's risotto with balsamic vinegar. 

1526
01:01:50,025 --> 01:01:50,958
I've never tried this before. 

1527
01:01:50,958 --> 01:01:52,225
(Balsamic risotto, $20.80) 

1528
01:01:52,225 --> 01:01:53,925
This is so hard. 

1529
01:01:54,591 --> 01:01:56,525
This is so hard. 

1530
01:01:56,525 --> 01:01:59,825
They are coming down again. My goodness. 

1531
01:01:59,825 --> 01:02:01,225
It's super saturated. 

1532
01:02:01,225 --> 01:02:03,458
What should I do? 

1533
01:02:04,158 --> 01:02:06,558
What do I do with Bologna? 

1534
01:02:07,491 --> 01:02:10,058
- Gosh, it must be delicious. / - It looks great. 

1535
01:02:10,991 --> 01:02:12,225
It tastes good already. 

1536
01:02:13,158 --> 01:02:16,558
They boiled the rice until it's al dente. 

1537
01:02:16,558 --> 01:02:18,225
- It looks so good. / - It's tender... 

1538
01:02:18,225 --> 01:02:19,658
- Risotto. / - But slightly chewy. 

1539
01:02:20,258 --> 01:02:21,625
I like the texture. 

1540
01:02:22,225 --> 01:02:25,058
I like the mouthful of rice starch. 

1541
01:02:27,091 --> 01:02:28,425
Good rice 

1542
01:02:28,425 --> 01:02:30,525
with balsamic vinegar. 

1543
01:02:30,525 --> 01:02:31,458
It looks great. 

1544
01:02:34,091 --> 01:02:35,291
I'm not watching it. 

1545
01:02:35,291 --> 01:02:37,558
- Gosh. / - Wonil, you have to watch it. 

1546
01:02:37,558 --> 01:02:39,525
- I'm not watching. / - You can't do that. 

1547
01:02:39,525 --> 01:02:40,825
Look at that. 

1548
01:02:40,825 --> 01:02:42,425
- Gosh, it looks so good. / - Stop it. 

1549
01:02:42,425 --> 01:02:43,591
Balsamic, balsamic. 

1550
01:02:43,591 --> 01:02:44,691
You have to watch this. 

1551
01:02:54,358 --> 01:02:55,691
They are eating so well. 

1552
01:02:56,625 --> 01:02:57,858
This is so good. 

1553
01:02:58,391 --> 01:03:00,358
We kept saying it looked like soy sauce. 

1554
01:03:00,358 --> 01:03:01,625
- The balsamic vinegar. / - Right. 

1555
01:03:01,625 --> 01:03:04,191
Simply put, it tastes like 

1556
01:03:04,191 --> 01:03:07,291
fancy and expensive rice with soy sauce and butter. 

1557
01:03:07,291 --> 01:03:08,458
(Fancy rice with soy sauce and butter) 

1558
01:03:11,158 --> 01:03:12,458
Rice with soy sauce and butter. 

1559
01:03:12,458 --> 01:03:14,191
But the soy sauce is very flavorful. 

1560
01:03:14,191 --> 01:03:16,125
Okay, I get it, 

1561
01:03:16,591 --> 01:03:19,058
I think they can sell this in Korea. 

1562
01:03:19,058 --> 01:03:21,258
The rice would taste different though. 

1563
01:03:21,958 --> 01:03:23,491
All I need is this. 

1564
01:03:23,491 --> 01:03:25,958
You can make this by grating parmesan cheese 

1565
01:03:25,958 --> 01:03:27,758
on a frying pan and frying it. 

1566
01:03:27,758 --> 01:03:30,458
On a special day, I should make risotto 

1567
01:03:30,458 --> 01:03:32,525
and add balsamic to it. 

1568
01:03:34,791 --> 01:03:36,025
It's like rice with soy sauce and butter. 

1569
01:03:36,025 --> 01:03:37,725
And it has a fried egg on it. 

1570
01:03:37,725 --> 01:03:40,758
- The crispy one. / - A Chinese style fried egg. 

1571
01:03:41,358 --> 01:03:42,225
This is my favorite. 

1572
01:03:44,425 --> 01:03:47,291
I want to go to a risotto restaurant 

1573
01:03:47,291 --> 01:03:49,358
and take my own balsamic vinegar. 

1574
01:03:53,158 --> 01:03:56,225
With risotto, I suggest Lambrusco. 

1575
01:03:56,225 --> 01:03:57,291
I see. 

1576
01:03:57,291 --> 01:04:00,491
He says the Lambrusco goes well with the risotto. 

1577
01:04:01,991 --> 01:04:02,758
The red wine. 

1578
01:04:02,758 --> 01:04:05,158
It's a red sparkling wine made in this neighborhood. 

1579
01:04:05,158 --> 01:04:07,458
It's a really famous wine from this neighborhood. 

1580
01:04:07,458 --> 01:04:09,125
- It's famous worldwide. / - Really? 

1581
01:04:09,125 --> 01:04:11,691
We usually drink white or rose sparkling wine 

1582
01:04:11,691 --> 01:04:13,091
but never red, right? 

1583
01:04:13,091 --> 01:04:14,191
It's from Italy. 

1584
01:04:15,625 --> 01:04:17,325
It's Lambrusco wine that is only grown 

1585
01:04:17,325 --> 01:04:18,725
from that neighborhood. 

1586
01:04:19,391 --> 01:04:21,691
- It's carbonated? / - It is and it's sweet. 

1587
01:04:22,125 --> 01:04:24,125
Lovelyz are talking noisily. 

1588
01:04:24,125 --> 01:04:26,125
They get noisy when you talk about alcohol. 

1589
01:04:27,791 --> 01:04:29,258
He just said the wine would go well. 

1590
01:04:29,258 --> 01:04:31,058
Let's drink this first and then eat. 

1591
01:04:31,058 --> 01:04:32,391
(Lambrusco wine, $7.80 per glass) 

1592
01:04:32,391 --> 01:04:33,425
The flavors burst inside my mouth. 

1593
01:04:38,758 --> 01:04:40,291
- The tastes go well together. / - Yes. 

1594
01:04:40,925 --> 01:04:43,125
I've only had white sparkling wine. 

1595
01:04:43,591 --> 01:04:44,891
Is it a dessert wine? 

1596
01:04:44,891 --> 01:04:47,091
- No, it's semi-sweet. / - Semi-sweet? 

1597
01:04:47,091 --> 01:04:48,258
It's not that sweet. 

1598
01:04:48,258 --> 01:04:51,658
It's not like ice wine, it's a little drier than that. 

1599
01:04:52,358 --> 01:04:54,758
- The rice can be... / - That's right. 

1600
01:04:54,758 --> 01:04:57,725
A little too rich. 

1601
01:04:57,725 --> 01:05:01,225
It feels so nice to drink refreshing carbonated red wine 

1602
01:05:01,225 --> 01:05:03,058
that isn't too sweet nor strong 

1603
01:05:03,058 --> 01:05:05,491
after eating the rice. 

1604
01:05:05,491 --> 01:05:07,625
I want to go outside on the terrace and eat this. 

1605
01:05:07,625 --> 01:05:10,358
I think it's a perfect pair to drink this wine with this. 

1606
01:05:11,891 --> 01:05:13,125
Look at that! 

1607
01:05:13,125 --> 01:05:15,158
- What is it? It's here. / - I'm curious about that meat. 

1608
01:05:15,158 --> 01:05:16,191
Look at that! 

1609
01:05:16,658 --> 01:05:19,158
- Is that a T-bone steak? / - Isn't that a T-bone? 

1610
01:05:19,158 --> 01:05:20,158
It's a T-bone steak. 

1611
01:05:20,158 --> 01:05:22,058
Are they going to cook it in that fire behind you? 

1612
01:05:22,058 --> 01:05:23,458
- Yes! / - They grilled it for us there. 

1613
01:05:23,458 --> 01:05:24,858
Did they grill it for you there? 

1614
01:05:26,191 --> 01:05:28,158
Do they grill it using the fire behind? 

1615
01:05:28,691 --> 01:05:30,058
- That's amazing. / - Gosh. 

1616
01:05:33,525 --> 01:05:34,858
That's amazing. 

1617
01:05:35,758 --> 01:05:37,525
That is so nice. 

1618
01:05:37,525 --> 01:05:39,391
You can see it in front of your eyes. 

1619
01:05:41,158 --> 01:05:44,658
(The steak is full of olive oil and smoke aroma) 

1620
01:05:47,091 --> 01:05:48,925
Look at it getting sliced. 

1621
01:05:48,925 --> 01:05:50,891
(After the steak is rested, it gets cut right away) 

1622
01:05:52,725 --> 01:05:55,091
Actually, that's not easy. 

1623
01:05:55,658 --> 01:05:57,758
Grilling the steak in that kind of fire 

1624
01:05:57,758 --> 01:05:59,525
and resting it to make it more delicious. 

1625
01:06:04,291 --> 01:06:06,725
(T-bone steak, $54.60) 

1626
01:06:06,725 --> 01:06:10,858
Sook, here. 

1627
01:06:10,858 --> 01:06:13,358
- Just pick this up right away. / - Okay. 

1628
01:06:13,358 --> 01:06:15,091
I'll make the decision right away today. 

1629
01:06:15,091 --> 01:06:18,725
I won't do this today. I'll just choose this right now. 

1630
01:06:21,591 --> 01:06:23,291
- Is this beef tenderloin? / - Yes. 

1631
01:06:23,291 --> 01:06:25,191
The small cut is tenderloin and 

1632
01:06:25,191 --> 01:06:26,391
the large cut is sirloin. 

1633
01:06:26,391 --> 01:06:28,858
(Drizzling) 

1634
01:06:31,158 --> 01:06:32,258
This is insane. 

1635
01:06:34,125 --> 01:06:36,158
(He fully appreciates the aroma of the meat first) 

1636
01:06:36,158 --> 01:06:38,091
I'm a little nervous right now. 

1637
01:06:39,891 --> 01:06:41,025
You should try it first. 

1638
01:06:41,591 --> 01:06:42,725
No, I'll try it first. 

1639
01:06:44,725 --> 01:06:48,425
(He nervously takes the first bite of the steak) 

1640
01:06:48,425 --> 01:06:50,458
Is this the best steak of your life? 

1641
01:06:50,458 --> 01:06:51,925
(His face is a little ambiguous) 

1642
01:06:51,925 --> 01:06:54,291
No, it's before the flavor of the meat has burst. 

1643
01:06:56,225 --> 01:06:57,791
(This is amazing) 

1644
01:06:57,791 --> 01:06:59,225
It burst. 

1645
01:06:59,225 --> 01:07:01,425
- It burst. / - It looks really good. 

1646
01:07:02,391 --> 01:07:03,825
Even I think that it looks good. 

1647
01:07:08,258 --> 01:07:10,825
(This really is the best steak) 

1648
01:07:10,825 --> 01:07:12,058
Gosh. 

1649
01:07:12,058 --> 01:07:15,291
(Is it that good?) 

1650
01:07:16,525 --> 01:07:18,791
(This steak is really done properly) 

1651
01:07:20,991 --> 01:07:24,991
(An unexpected silent broadcast) 

1652
01:07:26,058 --> 01:07:27,791
Hey... 

1653
01:07:27,791 --> 01:07:28,791
What is this? 

1654
01:07:28,791 --> 01:07:31,258
- This is a little... / - That is insane. 

1655
01:07:31,258 --> 01:07:34,491
I'm not exaggerating. This is really delicious. 

1656
01:07:34,491 --> 01:07:37,025
The inside is like really expensive tuna... 

1657
01:07:37,025 --> 01:07:38,758
- With only red flesh. / - Yes. 

1658
01:07:38,991 --> 01:07:41,358
- Look at the juice. / - It's so tender. 

1659
01:07:41,358 --> 01:07:42,825
Usually, when meat is this rare... 

1660
01:07:43,491 --> 01:07:46,491
- It's gamey. / - Yes. 

1661
01:07:46,491 --> 01:07:50,125
But it's not and it has a pleasant aroma. 

1662
01:07:50,125 --> 01:07:51,791
It's aroma from the meat if put in a good way 

1663
01:07:51,791 --> 01:07:52,691
and odor in a bad way. 

1664
01:07:52,691 --> 01:07:53,825
- But... / - That's right. 

1665
01:07:53,825 --> 01:07:56,691
Usually, we eat tenderloin 

1666
01:07:56,691 --> 01:07:58,925
because it's really tender and it has a clean taste. 

1667
01:07:58,925 --> 01:08:00,991
We like to eat sirloin because 

1668
01:08:00,991 --> 01:08:03,558
it's a little greasy and has firmer texture. 

1669
01:08:03,558 --> 01:08:05,658
But both of them are so tender. 

1670
01:08:05,658 --> 01:08:08,591
The sirloin isn't greasy like we thought. 

1671
01:08:09,391 --> 01:08:10,758
- It only has a little of that. / - Yes. 

1672
01:08:11,458 --> 01:08:13,525
(Tender yet firm, the steak is very charming) 

1673
01:08:13,525 --> 01:08:14,558
This... 

1674
01:08:14,558 --> 01:08:16,258
I wasn't going to put things on top again 

1675
01:08:16,258 --> 01:08:18,358
but I have to do it. 

1676
01:08:20,458 --> 01:08:21,658
I think I'm getting dizzy. 

1677
01:08:21,658 --> 01:08:25,391
I'd like to give some advice to people who come here 

1678
01:08:25,391 --> 01:08:27,391
after seeing this show. 

1679
01:08:27,391 --> 01:08:29,225
You should try 1 or 2 pieces of the meat plain first. 

1680
01:08:29,225 --> 01:08:32,558
After that, you should drizzle olive oil on top and try it. 

1681
01:08:32,558 --> 01:08:34,791
All of the bitterness of the meat goes away 

1682
01:08:34,791 --> 01:08:35,758
and it tastes sweet. 

1683
01:08:35,758 --> 01:08:36,958
That's right. 

1684
01:08:36,958 --> 01:08:38,358
You will experience the meat 

1685
01:08:38,358 --> 01:08:39,658
suddenly becoming sweet. 

1686
01:08:39,658 --> 01:08:41,325
I put too much salt. 

1687
01:08:42,658 --> 01:08:43,858
It goes so well with the olive oil. 

1688
01:08:43,858 --> 01:08:47,625
(It's so delicious) 

1689
01:08:48,291 --> 01:08:50,591
(He sweeps his hair because he's moved) 

1690
01:08:50,591 --> 01:08:51,825
He's finally doing it. 

1691
01:08:53,258 --> 01:08:55,458
Honestly, it's so good. 

1692
01:08:55,458 --> 01:08:56,691
Please just watch next week 

1693
01:08:56,691 --> 01:08:58,325
focusing on the entertainment. 

1694
01:09:00,525 --> 01:09:00,891
(How was the meal?) 

1695
01:09:00,891 --> 01:09:02,525
Yes, we are very fine. 

1696
01:09:03,391 --> 01:09:05,858
Can I have the menu for dessert? 

1697
01:09:05,858 --> 01:09:06,391
Yeah. 

1698
01:09:06,391 --> 01:09:08,625
No, no, no! Please don't take it away! 

1699
01:09:08,625 --> 01:09:09,091
Yeah. 

1700
01:09:09,091 --> 01:09:11,591
No, no, no! Please don't take it away! 

1701
01:09:12,391 --> 01:09:13,925
Don't break my heart. 

1702
01:09:15,991 --> 01:09:17,225
He almost got in trouble. 

1703
01:09:18,025 --> 01:09:20,191
What happened? I was so surprised. 

1704
01:09:21,025 --> 01:09:22,591
I should hurry and put it on my plate. 

1705
01:09:24,558 --> 01:09:26,158
(Clattering) 

1706
01:09:26,158 --> 01:09:27,658
Something is coming. 

1707
01:09:27,658 --> 01:09:28,725
(What is the noise that boasts its presence?) 

1708
01:09:29,591 --> 01:09:30,958
What is this? 

1709
01:09:32,625 --> 01:09:34,858
(The dessert trolley came in) 

1710
01:09:34,858 --> 01:09:36,225
Is this? 

1711
01:09:38,425 --> 01:09:39,625
What is that? 

1712
01:09:39,625 --> 01:09:40,891
That's the dessert? 

1713
01:09:42,058 --> 01:09:43,325
Amazing. 

1714
01:09:43,325 --> 01:09:44,758
- Oh, my. / - What is this? 

1715
01:09:44,758 --> 01:09:47,091
The dessert menu also changes every day. 

1716
01:09:47,458 --> 01:09:51,058
This is a classic English... 

1717
01:09:52,658 --> 01:09:54,325
(He doesn't have time to pick) 

1718
01:09:54,325 --> 01:09:58,025
(Too busy taking photos) 

1719
01:09:58,025 --> 01:10:00,758
- Too many I want to eat. / - You want it all, right? 

1720
01:10:01,758 --> 01:10:05,758
Hey... We'll just get rid of this. 

1721
01:10:06,791 --> 01:10:08,191
I'm full but I want to eat, 

1722
01:10:08,191 --> 01:10:09,225
so I don't know what to choose. 

1723
01:10:11,491 --> 01:10:14,025
Today has been the hardest episode of Battle Trip. 

1724
01:10:16,725 --> 01:10:19,191
I'll have one piece of this tart. 

1725
01:10:19,191 --> 01:10:22,091
- Yes. / - That, that and this. 

1726
01:10:22,091 --> 01:10:23,858
- That's everything. / - These? 

1727
01:10:23,858 --> 01:10:25,325
- Yes, please. / - Yes. 

1728
01:10:27,225 --> 01:10:28,225
(Dessert, $2.40 per piece) 

1729
01:10:28,225 --> 01:10:30,058
Did you eat that many desserts? 

1730
01:10:30,058 --> 01:10:31,291
That's not a lot. 

1731
01:10:33,291 --> 01:10:34,758
It really looks good. 

1732
01:10:35,291 --> 01:10:36,758
- It's good. / - This one? 

1733
01:10:36,758 --> 01:10:38,258
- The chocolate? / - The inside is moist. 

1734
01:10:38,825 --> 01:10:40,758
This really feels homemade. 

1735
01:10:40,758 --> 01:10:42,091
I think it's right to eat this 

1736
01:10:42,091 --> 01:10:43,491
if you really want to feel Italy. 

1737
01:10:43,825 --> 01:10:46,825
I should eat the last piece of meat as dessert. 

1738
01:10:48,425 --> 01:10:49,625
Steak... 

1739
01:10:49,625 --> 01:10:51,391
(I shall stick to my steak) 

1740
01:10:51,391 --> 01:10:52,758
He's eating the remaining steak. 

1741
01:10:52,758 --> 01:10:54,691
- I want to try that steak. / - The steak is... 

1742
01:10:54,691 --> 01:10:56,291
Ridiculous. 

1743
01:10:56,291 --> 01:10:57,458
It's my first time eating something like that. 

1744
01:10:57,458 --> 01:10:59,558
- We gained a lot of weight. / - Yes. 

1745
01:11:00,225 --> 01:11:02,191
- But it's sad to end like this. / - Yes. 

1746
01:11:02,191 --> 01:11:04,025
Let's go back to Bologna. 

1747
01:11:05,058 --> 01:11:06,358
Let's just have one more drink. 

1748
01:11:06,925 --> 01:11:08,958
Okay, let's have one more drink. 

1749
01:11:08,958 --> 01:11:11,925
(No matter what they say, it was a good last banquet) 

1750
01:11:12,425 --> 01:11:15,258
I didn't have a lot of awareness for Italian beef. 

1751
01:11:15,258 --> 01:11:18,091
After eating that, my perspective completely changed. 

1752
01:11:18,091 --> 01:11:19,958
I didn't know that Italian meat was so delicious. 

1753
01:11:21,225 --> 01:11:23,691
(Average score for the last supper of Modena, 5 stars) 

1754
01:11:23,691 --> 01:11:26,991
(They recommend balsamic risotto and truffle pasta) 

1755
01:11:26,991 --> 01:11:28,491
(We Will Eat Tour in Bologna, Day 2) 

1756
01:11:28,491 --> 01:11:33,891
(A trendy place for dinner) 

1757
01:11:33,891 --> 01:11:39,825
(30 minutes from the restaurant to the pub) 

1758
01:11:40,791 --> 01:11:45,225
(The last evening in Bologna is coming to a close) 

1759
01:11:46,025 --> 01:11:49,058
(Darkness veils Piazza Maggiore) 

1760
01:11:49,991 --> 01:11:53,925
(The streets are lively with people) 

1761
01:11:53,925 --> 01:11:56,791
Let's find a place to have a light last drink. 

1762
01:11:56,791 --> 01:11:57,791
Okay, good. 

1763
01:11:58,425 --> 01:11:59,991
- It changed like this. / - There are... 

1764
01:11:59,991 --> 01:12:02,058
A lot of people here. 

1765
01:12:02,058 --> 01:12:05,825
- This is the alley where we ate... / - So many people. 

1766
01:12:05,825 --> 01:12:06,858
- The sandwich. / - Yes. 

1767
01:12:06,858 --> 01:12:09,258
- And the fish shop. / - It seems completely different. 

1768
01:12:09,258 --> 01:12:10,691
It's a market during the day 

1769
01:12:10,691 --> 01:12:12,091
and they clear everything at night. 

1770
01:12:12,091 --> 01:12:13,791
It completely changes into a street for young people. 

1771
01:12:13,791 --> 01:12:16,825
They become like outdoor cafes and outdoor bars. 

1772
01:12:16,825 --> 01:12:18,958
The atmosphere is almost like Itaewon. 

1773
01:12:18,958 --> 01:12:21,125
It completely becomes a trendy place like this. 

1774
01:12:21,125 --> 01:12:22,725
- Yes. / - There are empty seats there. 

1775
01:12:22,725 --> 01:12:24,758
Okay, let's have some beer. 

1776
01:12:28,225 --> 01:12:30,725
You need to have some beer to end the day well. 

1777
01:12:30,725 --> 01:12:31,858
(Refreshing) 

1778
01:12:31,858 --> 01:12:33,891
That must be so refreshing. 

1779
01:12:36,825 --> 01:12:37,991
It was nice. 

1780
01:12:37,991 --> 01:12:41,958
I think we focused on the concept of a gourmet tour 

1781
01:12:41,958 --> 01:12:45,058
and tasted everything of the Italian cuisine. 

1782
01:12:45,058 --> 01:12:46,225
I really liked it. 

1783
01:12:46,225 --> 01:12:49,325
- Was it "Bologna la grassa?" / - Yes. 

1784
01:12:49,325 --> 01:12:51,091
It means that Bologna is the city of gluttony. 

1785
01:12:51,091 --> 01:12:53,491
I fully understand the meaning of that saying. 

1786
01:12:53,491 --> 01:12:56,258
The cheese, ham, bread 

1787
01:12:56,258 --> 01:12:57,958
and wine are delicious. 

1788
01:12:57,958 --> 01:12:59,358
So if you lose your mind a little, 

1789
01:12:59,358 --> 01:13:01,991
you will quickly become a grassa. 

1790
01:13:02,891 --> 01:13:04,458
I think the food tasted better as time went by. 

1791
01:13:04,458 --> 01:13:05,825
I'm happy to be here. 

1792
01:13:05,825 --> 01:13:08,391
It was an experience that made me feel so good. 

1793
01:13:08,391 --> 01:13:11,791
Eat, enjoy and love. This is Italy. 

1794
01:13:13,025 --> 01:13:16,158
Italy is love. 

1795
01:13:16,158 --> 01:13:17,625
(Their enjoyable trip ends here) 

1796
01:13:17,625 --> 01:13:19,858
- Thank you. / - Thank you. Good job. 

1797
01:13:21,725 --> 01:13:23,491
Italy is amazing. 

1798
01:13:23,491 --> 01:13:24,825
It was amazing. 

1799
01:13:25,725 --> 01:13:31,658
(We Will Eat Tour's final evaluation of Bologna) 

1800
01:13:33,925 --> 01:13:34,991
That was amazing. 

1801
01:13:34,991 --> 01:13:36,125
(We strongly recommend Bologna for a gourmet trip) 

1802
01:13:36,125 --> 01:13:38,891
- Isn't that so funny? / - I think it really was... 

1803
01:13:38,891 --> 01:13:40,625
The hardest episode to endure. 

1804
01:13:40,625 --> 01:13:43,925
I really thank you deeply for last week. 

1805
01:13:44,558 --> 01:13:46,325
- Wasn't the food too good? / - Just stop. 

1806
01:13:46,891 --> 01:13:48,558
We accept it was good. 

1807
01:13:48,558 --> 01:13:50,925
The corner inside a corner, Sook's Choice. 

1808
01:13:50,925 --> 01:13:52,625
- Let's check the ranking. / - Okay. 

1809
01:13:52,625 --> 01:13:53,825
Personally... 

1810
01:13:54,425 --> 01:13:56,558
I wasn't going to put things on top. 

1811
01:13:56,558 --> 01:14:00,291
But the balsamic risotto looked so good. 

1812
01:14:00,291 --> 01:14:02,291
- Don't you want to try it? / - For the T-bone steak... 

1813
01:14:02,291 --> 01:14:04,725
Sikyung judges taste objectively 

1814
01:14:04,725 --> 01:14:05,825
because he's a gourmand. 

1815
01:14:05,825 --> 01:14:07,591
But he said this was the best steak of his life. 

1816
01:14:07,591 --> 01:14:10,158
I really want to try this. 

1817
01:14:10,158 --> 01:14:12,658
I can't leave out the truffle pasta too. 

1818
01:14:12,658 --> 01:14:14,125
Because it's only $19. 

1819
01:14:15,758 --> 01:14:17,558
Then for 1st place... 

1820
01:14:18,191 --> 01:14:19,558
(Deliberating) 

1821
01:14:19,558 --> 01:14:22,091
I'll choose the balsamic risotto. 

1822
01:14:22,091 --> 01:14:23,558
(Sook chooses the balsamic risotto) 

1823
01:14:23,558 --> 01:14:24,791
I really want to try this. 

1824
01:14:24,791 --> 01:14:25,991
- It was good. / - Yes. 

1825
01:14:25,991 --> 01:14:28,925
Let's decide then. Lovelyz? 

1826
01:14:29,358 --> 01:14:30,758
What did you choose for 1st place? 

1827
01:14:30,758 --> 01:14:33,958
- We chose... / - We had a hard time choosing. 

1828
01:14:33,958 --> 01:14:35,991
We wanted to try all of those. 

1829
01:14:35,991 --> 01:14:38,625
- Isn't that right? / - All of them looked delicious. 

1830
01:14:38,625 --> 01:14:39,858
We wanted to try everything so 

1831
01:14:39,858 --> 01:14:41,458
we agonized a lot over it. 

1832
01:14:41,458 --> 01:14:43,625
We finally chose the T-bone steak. 

1833
01:14:43,625 --> 01:14:44,958
The T-bone steak. 

1834
01:14:44,958 --> 01:14:46,758
We'll put T-bone steak in 1st place. 

1835
01:14:46,758 --> 01:14:49,825
PENTAGON? They're still discussing. 

1836
01:14:49,825 --> 01:14:51,458
- Our 1st place is... / - 1st place? 

1837
01:14:51,458 --> 01:14:53,825
- The truffle pasta. / - The truffle pasta. 

1838
01:14:53,825 --> 01:14:58,158
We have similar tastes in food. All of them are here. 

1839
01:14:58,158 --> 01:14:59,991
There's nothing to leave out here. 

1840
01:14:59,991 --> 01:15:02,925
- Very true. / - I put everything on top... 

1841
01:15:02,925 --> 01:15:05,758
I didn't replace anything. The list just moved down. 

1842
01:15:05,758 --> 01:15:07,558
- Hwijae, what's wrong? / - Yes? 

1843
01:15:07,558 --> 01:15:09,058
Can't we watch Barcelona again? 

1844
01:15:10,125 --> 01:15:12,991
No, we can't. This isn't the end. 

1845
01:15:12,991 --> 01:15:14,325
We told you before. 

1846
01:15:14,325 --> 01:15:16,325
We will continue to foul until we're ejected. 

1847
01:15:16,325 --> 01:15:18,058
- Please ring the bell. / - Do I have to ring the bell? 

1848
01:15:19,191 --> 01:15:20,591
Let's see what the foul is. 

1849
01:15:21,825 --> 01:15:23,091
- What is it? / - It can't be. 

1850
01:15:23,091 --> 01:15:25,158
We prepared the ham that is the color of my shirt. 

1851
01:15:25,158 --> 01:15:26,591
- Gosh. / - Oh, my. 

1852
01:15:27,225 --> 01:15:29,025
(Oh, my) 

1853
01:15:29,025 --> 01:15:29,991
Mortadella! 

1854
01:15:31,225 --> 01:15:32,425
The smell is amazing. 

1855
01:15:33,058 --> 01:15:34,158
There are pistachios. 

1856
01:15:34,158 --> 01:15:35,291
I was really curious. 

1857
01:15:37,325 --> 01:15:38,391
This is insane. 

1858
01:15:38,891 --> 01:15:40,791
I know now why you had so much of this with bread. 

1859
01:15:40,791 --> 01:15:42,158
That's right. You have to eat this with bread. 

1860
01:15:42,825 --> 01:15:45,091
Don't refrigerate the mortadella. 

1861
01:15:45,091 --> 01:15:49,091
It has a lot of minute fat inside. 

1862
01:15:49,091 --> 01:15:51,125
- You can just eat it as it is. / - Just enjoy it as it is. 

1863
01:15:51,125 --> 01:15:53,358
This isn't salty. 

1864
01:15:54,158 --> 01:15:56,525
- So you don't need bread. / - It's really tender. 

1865
01:15:58,025 --> 01:15:59,591
You have to put a lot of slices 

1866
01:15:59,591 --> 01:16:00,258
when you eat it with bread. 

1867
01:16:00,258 --> 01:16:01,825
I recommend eating one piece 

1868
01:16:01,825 --> 01:16:03,125
if you're going to eat just this. 

1869
01:16:04,091 --> 01:16:05,558
You should eat it with beer. 

1870
01:16:05,558 --> 01:16:07,425
You really need beer with this. 

1871
01:16:08,025 --> 01:16:10,191
How can the texture be like this? 

1872
01:16:10,191 --> 01:16:13,925
They sell this in Korea but it's expensive. 

1873
01:16:13,925 --> 01:16:14,858
You can get tired of eating this, 

1874
01:16:14,858 --> 01:16:16,758
so the way to not get tired 

1875
01:16:16,758 --> 01:16:19,391
is to first eat like this. When you start eating a lot, 

1876
01:16:19,391 --> 01:16:21,525
I recommend eating it with white kimchi. 

1877
01:16:21,958 --> 01:16:24,158
- They go well together. / - It will be great with kimchi. 

1878
01:16:24,158 --> 01:16:25,958
I want to wrap it with hot rice. 

1879
01:16:25,958 --> 01:16:26,991
- Isn't that right? / - Yes. 

1880
01:16:26,991 --> 01:16:28,491
PENTAGON, what do you think? 

1881
01:16:28,491 --> 01:16:30,091
They completely emptied it. 

1882
01:16:30,091 --> 01:16:32,091
- This answers for us. / - Yes. 

1883
01:16:32,091 --> 01:16:34,025
- This was the best ham of my life. / - Me too. 

1884
01:16:34,025 --> 01:16:35,025
(Mortadella was the best sausage of his life) 

1885
01:16:35,025 --> 01:16:37,391
He said it was the best ham of his life. 

1886
01:16:37,391 --> 01:16:39,991
They won't forget us when we did this much, right? 

1887
01:16:39,991 --> 01:16:42,458
We need to check the most important thing now. 

1888
01:16:42,458 --> 01:16:45,825
Instead of the total expense spent in Bologna, Italy... 

1889
01:16:45,825 --> 01:16:48,158
- We should also check... / - Yes. 

1890
01:16:48,158 --> 01:16:49,925
The food expense for this week. 

1891
01:16:49,925 --> 01:16:53,325
For Venice, they spent $204. 

1892
01:16:53,325 --> 01:16:55,091
- $204. / - I think they spent more than that. 

1893
01:16:55,091 --> 01:16:56,125
For 1 night 2 days, 

1894
01:16:56,125 --> 01:16:57,925
the total food expense for 7 meals is... 

1895
01:16:58,491 --> 01:16:59,891
- Per person. / - Per person! 

1896
01:17:00,691 --> 01:17:03,791
(How much did they spent on food in Bologna?) 

1897
01:17:04,691 --> 01:17:05,891
(How much will it be?) 

1898
01:17:06,525 --> 01:17:11,191
$166. 

1899
01:17:11,825 --> 01:17:13,691
It's for 7 meals. 7 meals. 

1900
01:17:13,691 --> 01:17:15,925
- The prices are low. / - It's for 7 meals. 

1901
01:17:15,925 --> 01:17:19,891
Bologna isn't a tourist spot like Rome or Venice. 

1902
01:17:19,891 --> 01:17:21,425
- It's quite cheap. / - It's much cheaper. 

1903
01:17:21,425 --> 01:17:23,925
Why does Hwijae's face look so bad? 

1904
01:17:23,925 --> 01:17:25,291
I'm okay. 

1905
01:17:25,991 --> 01:17:28,158
- I'm okay. / - Wonil, are you okay? 

1906
01:17:28,158 --> 01:17:30,858
- They will forget it next week. / - Yes. 

1907
01:17:30,858 --> 01:17:32,391
- We'll begin afresh. / - My gosh. 

1908
01:17:32,391 --> 01:17:34,258
We're just talking like this.

The warm sun of the Mediterranean. 

1920
01:18:06,658 --> 01:18:08,925
It's been saturated in it. 

1921
01:18:11,325 --> 01:18:12,958
This is totally nice. 

1922
01:18:12,958 --> 01:18:16,125
