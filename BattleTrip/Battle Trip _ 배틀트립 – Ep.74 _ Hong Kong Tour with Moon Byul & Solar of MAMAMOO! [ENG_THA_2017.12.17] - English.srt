1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,343
On Saturday night, we provide great tips for trips.

2
00:00:02,343 --> 00:00:03,843
It's time for Battle Trip.

3
00:00:03,843 --> 00:00:05,776
We haven't been able to say hello in a while.

4
00:00:05,776 --> 00:00:08,010
- It's been a while. / - It's so nice to see you.

5
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:10,110
- I almost forgot your faces. / - I know.

6
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:13,443
But Sikyung, you released two great songs

7
00:00:13,443 --> 00:00:15,543
while we haven't seen you.

8
00:00:15,543 --> 00:00:17,776
Those of you who know will know

9
00:00:17,776 --> 00:00:20,276
but I recently made my debut in Japan.

10
00:00:20,276 --> 00:00:22,643
- I released my first album there. / - A new start.

11
00:00:22,643 --> 00:00:25,376
I felt so bad for my Korean fans.

12
00:00:25,376 --> 00:00:27,243
- They seemed to hate it. / - Japan...

13
00:00:27,243 --> 00:00:29,210
- Why? / - That I don't even...

14
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:30,010
Release a song in Korea but

15
00:00:30,010 --> 00:00:32,010
I released an album in Japan.

16
00:00:32,010 --> 00:00:35,676
So I wanted to do something for listeners in Korea.

17
00:00:35,676 --> 00:00:36,743
Good job.

18
00:00:36,743 --> 00:00:38,176
Sook, I assume you were very busy.

19
00:00:38,176 --> 00:00:40,810
I was just working hard like an ant.

20
00:00:40,810 --> 00:00:43,776
- Like a bull. / - I've been working very hard.

21
00:00:43,776 --> 00:00:46,276
For me, without Battle Trip, it's always...

22
00:00:46,276 --> 00:00:47,776
- What do you do? / - "The Return of Superman."

23
00:00:47,776 --> 00:00:49,843
- Your life, you mean. / - Oh, your life.

24
00:00:49,843 --> 00:00:51,376
But I think being a homemaker suits you

25
00:00:51,376 --> 00:00:52,910
because you look so much better now.

26
00:00:52,910 --> 00:00:53,810
Yes.

27
00:00:55,010 --> 00:00:57,343
- I can see you as a homemaker. / - For real.

28
00:00:57,343 --> 00:01:00,476
We haven't met each other in a while.

29
00:01:00,476 --> 00:01:02,643
- So we've been chatting here. / - Yes.

30
00:01:02,643 --> 00:01:04,476
But when it's starting to get cold...

31
00:01:04,876 --> 00:01:06,943
People really enjoy Battle Trip as they can't get out.

32
00:01:06,943 --> 00:01:09,276
- We apologize for not being here. / - I know.

33
00:01:09,276 --> 00:01:12,010
First of all, we do have a travel request today.

34
00:01:12,010 --> 00:01:13,043
Yes, we do.

35
00:01:13,043 --> 00:01:14,110
- Let's see the request. / - Let's see.

36
00:01:14,776 --> 00:01:17,110
Hello. My name is Shin Nayeon, I'm 21

37
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:19,310
and I'm a university student who loves to travel.

38
00:01:19,743 --> 00:01:23,610
I've been to Taiwan, Hong Kong, China, Japan,

39
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:26,376
Vietnam and mostly countries close to Korea.

40
00:01:26,376 --> 00:01:28,610
Among those, I've always wanted to revisit

41
00:01:28,610 --> 00:01:29,843
Taiwan and Hong Kong.

42
00:01:29,843 --> 00:01:32,143
I am trying to figure out which country to go to.

43
00:01:32,143 --> 00:01:35,343
Other than already famous tourist spots

44
00:01:35,343 --> 00:01:37,176
in Taiwan and Hong Kong,

45
00:01:37,176 --> 00:01:40,010
I hope Battle Trip can introduce sites that are

46
00:01:40,010 --> 00:01:42,243
not well-known in Taiwan and Hong Kong.

47
00:01:42,243 --> 00:01:43,843
Before we split teams.

48
00:01:43,843 --> 00:01:45,443
Taiwan or Hong Kong? 1, 2, 3.

49
00:01:45,443 --> 00:01:46,210
Hong Kong.

50
00:01:46,210 --> 00:01:47,543
Taiwan or Hong Kong? 1, 2, 3.

51
00:01:47,543 --> 00:01:48,143
Taiwan.

52
00:01:48,143 --> 00:01:49,143
Taiwan or Hong Kong? 1, 2, 3.

53
00:01:49,143 --> 00:01:50,276
Taiwan.

54
00:01:50,276 --> 00:01:52,376
- It's 2 to 1. / - I've never been to Taiwan.

55
00:01:52,376 --> 00:01:54,143
- Me neither. / - I've been to both.

56
00:01:54,143 --> 00:01:56,110
- Really? / - Yes, I've been to both.

57
00:01:56,110 --> 00:01:58,476
I will be honest. Hong Kong suits me better.

58
00:01:58,476 --> 00:02:01,310
The drinks and food suit me better.

59
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:03,376
- Really? / - Yes. It's like that.

60
00:02:03,376 --> 00:02:04,510
- For me... / - Haven't you been to both?

61
00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:06,376
- I haven't been to Taiwan. / - Me neither.

62
00:02:06,376 --> 00:02:07,976
I've always wanted to go to Taiwan

63
00:02:07,976 --> 00:02:09,576
but I haven't been able to.

64
00:02:09,576 --> 00:02:13,076
People say Taiwan feels more like China.

65
00:02:13,076 --> 00:02:15,943
Yes, compared to Hong Kong, that's true.

66
00:02:15,943 --> 00:02:17,876
So I think the food will suit me better.

67
00:02:17,876 --> 00:02:20,910
Battle Trip has gone to Taiwan and Hong Kong...

68
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:21,910
- Twice already. / - Yes.

69
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:24,310
- A movie trip to HK. / - With Hong Seokcheon.

70
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:25,843
- And Hwangbo went as well. / - Hwangbo went.

71
00:02:25,843 --> 00:02:28,043
- She lived there. / - She acted as a tour guide.

72
00:02:28,043 --> 00:02:30,976
- Our BTOB friends went to Taiwan. / - Yes.

73
00:02:30,976 --> 00:02:33,043
And Ji Sangryeol and Kim Jongmin went too.

74
00:02:33,043 --> 00:02:34,643
They lost so miserably.

75
00:02:34,643 --> 00:02:35,643
- They really lost. / - Yes.

76
00:02:35,643 --> 00:02:38,210
And Kim Shinyeong and Shin Dong

77
00:02:38,210 --> 00:02:39,843
had so many great meals there.

78
00:02:39,843 --> 00:02:41,043
- Right. / - Yes.

79
00:02:41,043 --> 00:02:43,243
Hong Kong and Taiwan feel fairly close to us

80
00:02:43,243 --> 00:02:46,310
but these guests found new sides to both countries.

81
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:48,543
Let's bring in our trip designers.

82
00:02:48,543 --> 00:02:50,676
There's so much to do here.

83
00:02:50,676 --> 00:02:52,143
Can we just have fun then?

84
00:02:52,143 --> 00:02:54,210
Amazing!

85
00:02:54,210 --> 00:02:55,276
Let's go!

86
00:02:56,476 --> 00:02:58,743
It's like Hong Kong but not like Hong Kong.

87
00:02:58,743 --> 00:03:00,076
Look forward to it.

88
00:03:00,076 --> 00:03:01,710
- Yong Kong / - Byul Kong.

89
00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:03,976
Kong, kong, kong.

90
00:03:03,976 --> 00:03:06,076
Kong, kong, kong!

91
00:03:08,243 --> 00:03:11,043
This is MAMAMOO's Solar and Moon Byul

92
00:03:11,043 --> 00:03:12,743
who went to Hong Kong.

93
00:03:12,743 --> 00:03:13,576
Welcome.

94
00:03:13,576 --> 00:03:15,576
- 2, 3. / - Hello.

95
00:03:15,576 --> 00:03:17,043
- Yong Kong. / - Byul Kong.

96
00:03:17,043 --> 00:03:18,543
- Byul Kong. / - Yong Kong.

97
00:03:18,543 --> 00:03:20,110
- Moon and... / - Sunlight.

98
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:21,376
- Yong Kong. / - Byul Kong.

99
00:03:21,376 --> 00:03:22,643
Hong Kong!

100
00:03:22,643 --> 00:03:24,976
Battle Trip!

101
00:03:24,976 --> 00:03:27,376
I thought they were speaking Cantonese.

102
00:03:27,376 --> 00:03:28,610
- It was so long. / - At the end...

103
00:03:28,610 --> 00:03:30,410
They even harmonized.

104
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:33,276
- Really? / - We came up with it earlier.

105
00:03:33,276 --> 00:03:35,010
- It's because they are MAMAMOO. / - I see.

106
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:38,476
I heard that Solar acted as the tour guide this time.

107
00:03:38,476 --> 00:03:39,710
- The older member. / - Yes.

108
00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:43,343
Actually, my dream was to become a travel guide.

109
00:03:43,343 --> 00:03:45,710
- My gosh. / - So...

110
00:03:45,710 --> 00:03:48,243
Now I'm a singer

111
00:03:48,243 --> 00:03:49,976
but through this opportunity,

112
00:03:49,976 --> 00:03:52,810
I could properly act as a travel guide.

113
00:03:52,810 --> 00:03:53,643
- Really? / - Yes.

114
00:03:53,643 --> 00:03:56,410
Usually, people who want to be travel guides

115
00:03:56,410 --> 00:03:58,243
have lived abroad for a long time.

116
00:03:58,243 --> 00:04:00,110
Or people who really like to travel.

117
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:01,310
I love to travel.

118
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:03,110
Where do you want to be a travel guide?

119
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:04,210
In Korea.

120
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:06,710
- A travel guide for foreigners? / - Yes.

121
00:04:06,710 --> 00:04:07,876
- Something like that? / - Yes.

122
00:04:07,876 --> 00:04:08,710
She must've done really well.

123
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:11,410
But you two have a lot on your shoulders

124
00:04:11,410 --> 00:04:13,243
because they don't want a predictable trip.

125
00:04:13,243 --> 00:04:15,110
The request was for an intermediate travel course.

126
00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:17,876
We've already been there twice so there's pressure.

127
00:04:17,876 --> 00:04:21,276
When many people think of Hong Kong,

128
00:04:21,276 --> 00:04:23,243
after they get out of the airport,

129
00:04:23,243 --> 00:04:26,410
they go to Hong Kong Island first for their trip.

130
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:27,410
Hong Kong Island.

131
00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:30,643
Yes, but we spent 3 days and 2 nights

132
00:04:30,643 --> 00:04:32,076
in Lantau Island.

133
00:04:32,743 --> 00:04:34,210
- Lantau Island? / - Yes.

134
00:04:34,210 --> 00:04:35,776
- I've never heard of it. / - It's unfamiliar.

135
00:04:35,776 --> 00:04:38,210
If you look at the places we went to,

136
00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:41,210
you'll be surprised that it's actually Hong Kong.

137
00:04:41,210 --> 00:04:43,576
That's how I felt.

138
00:04:43,576 --> 00:04:45,343
I'm so curious. Shall we hurry and see?

139
00:04:45,343 --> 00:04:47,110
Then let's shout the tour name and take off.

140
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:49,476
- The tour name is so hard. / - Can you say it again?

141
00:04:49,476 --> 00:04:51,843
- Do it one more time. / - Until the end.

142
00:04:51,843 --> 00:04:54,210
- You have to harmonize too. / - Say, "Let's go" too.

143
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:55,676
- Until "let's go?" / - Yes.

144
00:04:55,676 --> 00:04:56,710
Start.

145
00:04:56,710 --> 00:04:58,110
- Yong Kong. / - Byul Kong.

146
00:04:58,110 --> 00:04:59,576
- Byul Kong. / - Yong Kong.

147
00:04:59,576 --> 00:05:01,043
- Moon and... / - Sunlight.

148
00:05:01,043 --> 00:05:02,243
- Yong Kong. / - Byul Kong.

149
00:05:02,243 --> 00:05:03,510
Hong Kong!

150
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:05,976
Battle Trip! Let's go!

151
00:05:06,843 --> 00:05:08,176
You guys are so good.

152
00:05:09,743 --> 00:05:12,143
Yeah.

153
00:05:13,010 --> 00:05:14,143
They're so excited.

154
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:17,076
- My gosh. / - They're not drunk.

155
00:05:18,376 --> 00:05:22,110
- We're finally here. / - Yes, finally...

156
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:23,043
We're going.

157
00:05:24,376 --> 00:05:28,410
(MAMAMOO is such an enthusiastic group)

158
00:05:31,643 --> 00:05:33,043
Oh, my eyes.

159
00:05:36,776 --> 00:05:39,410
(Solar, real name is Kim Yongseon, in charge of fun)

160
00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:47,010
What's the record?

161
00:05:48,910 --> 00:05:51,776
(Moon Byul is a fun and quirky girl)

162
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:55,110
- This feels so unfamiliar. / - What did you bring?

163
00:05:56,176 --> 00:05:57,876
This is our...

164
00:05:57,876 --> 00:06:00,043
Travel destination.

165
00:06:00,643 --> 00:06:02,410
Hong Kong.

166
00:06:03,243 --> 00:06:05,176
These are all information on Hong Kong.

167
00:06:05,776 --> 00:06:08,310
She's definitely very serious about her role.

168
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:10,110
She studied a lot for the trip.

169
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:12,710
Moon Byul, have you been to Hong Kong?

170
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:15,310
I've been there for a fan meeting and for work.

171
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:16,976
I didn't get to look around.

172
00:06:16,976 --> 00:06:19,976
I'm thinking about being the tour guide

173
00:06:19,976 --> 00:06:21,310
for this trip.

174
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:24,710
My dream used to be a travel guide.

175
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:26,276
Can I look forward to it?

176
00:06:26,276 --> 00:06:28,376
- You can look forward to it. / - Okay.

177
00:06:28,376 --> 00:06:30,676
So we're going to Hong Kong

178
00:06:30,676 --> 00:06:31,776
for this trip.

179
00:06:31,776 --> 00:06:34,876
The program has been to Hong Kong twice before.

180
00:06:34,876 --> 00:06:36,943
- Already. / - At Battle Trip?

181
00:06:36,943 --> 00:06:37,676
Yes.

182
00:06:37,676 --> 00:06:40,576
So the viewers may be tired of

183
00:06:40,576 --> 00:06:43,310
seeing Hong Kong again on this program.

184
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:45,476
- But there's nothing to be worried about. / - Why?

185
00:06:45,476 --> 00:06:49,276
People will expect to see the famous night view

186
00:06:49,276 --> 00:06:51,276
and buildings.

187
00:06:51,276 --> 00:06:52,876
- Right. / - Hong Kong is famous for that.

188
00:06:52,876 --> 00:06:54,743
That's what you expect when you think of Hong Kong.

189
00:06:54,743 --> 00:06:57,510
People usually think of shopping and such.

190
00:06:57,510 --> 00:07:00,510
And all those sites are focused on Hong Kong Island.

191
00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:02,510
So here... Wow... They're so much to do there.

192
00:07:02,510 --> 00:07:05,010
Shouldn't we visit here then?

193
00:07:05,010 --> 00:07:06,976
- It's urban... / - We're not going there.

194
00:07:07,910 --> 00:07:09,510
- We're not going there. / - Why?

195
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:11,176
We're going the opposite way.

196
00:07:11,176 --> 00:07:13,143
- We're going to Lantau Island. / - Lantau Island.

197
00:07:13,143 --> 00:07:14,910
I've never heard of Lantau Island.

198
00:07:16,376 --> 00:07:21,376
(This is the Hong Kong we commonly know)

199
00:07:22,843 --> 00:07:25,810
(Battle Trip has gone to Hong Kong twice)

200
00:07:27,143 --> 00:07:28,710
Are you ready?

201
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:29,976
Everyone!

202
00:07:29,976 --> 00:07:32,343
Come with us to Hong Kong.

203
00:07:32,343 --> 00:07:33,576
Let's go!

204
00:07:39,010 --> 00:07:42,310
This really doesn't feel like Hong Kong.

205
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:43,876
It's no joke.

206
00:07:43,876 --> 00:07:45,376
It's bigger than my face.

207
00:07:46,143 --> 00:07:47,410
- What was that earlier? / - Was that squid?

208
00:07:47,410 --> 00:07:49,243
- It's squid. / - A king squid.

209
00:07:49,243 --> 00:07:51,176
- For Hong Kong. / - Hong Kong.

210
00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:56,276
(It's unpredictable)

211
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:58,843
Mickey, Mickey!

212
00:08:00,976 --> 00:08:02,176
Oh, my eyes.

213
00:08:02,176 --> 00:08:03,710
- Yong Kong. / - Byul Kong.

214
00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:05,976
Hong Kong, kong, kong.

215
00:08:05,976 --> 00:08:07,910
Kong, kong, kong.

216
00:08:07,910 --> 00:08:11,110
We're heading to Lantau Island.

217
00:08:12,710 --> 00:08:14,176
You prepared so much.

218
00:08:14,176 --> 00:08:16,176
- Right? / - Yes.

219
00:08:16,176 --> 00:08:17,910
This is where we take the cable car.

220
00:08:20,776 --> 00:08:23,043
She's continuing to search and study?

221
00:08:23,043 --> 00:08:24,643
I looked up a lot.

222
00:08:25,410 --> 00:08:26,610
This is really good because

223
00:08:26,610 --> 00:08:28,276
you see as much as you know.

224
00:08:28,276 --> 00:08:31,010
- You're right. / - You see as much as you studied.

225
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:34,243
I'm looking around places to go.

226
00:08:34,543 --> 00:08:37,676
You're so obsessed with Battle Trip.

227
00:08:39,176 --> 00:08:41,076
If we want to win,

228
00:08:41,076 --> 00:08:43,843
I have to study this much.

229
00:08:43,843 --> 00:08:45,443
I have complete faith in you.

230
00:08:46,043 --> 00:08:49,010
(Their excitement explodes)

231
00:08:49,010 --> 00:08:50,043
That's normal, right?

232
00:08:51,143 --> 00:08:52,410
Let's go!

233
00:08:55,310 --> 00:08:56,310
I can't reach.

234
00:08:57,110 --> 00:08:59,776
You can do it. Stretch your arms.

235
00:08:59,776 --> 00:09:01,810
Don't you get that excited when the date is set?

236
00:09:01,810 --> 00:09:03,310
- Yes. / - Especially the day before leaving, right?

237
00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:05,376
Usually, you can't sleep the night before

238
00:09:05,376 --> 00:09:06,943
because you're so excited.

239
00:09:06,943 --> 00:09:07,943
(First day, Disneyland)

240
00:09:07,943 --> 00:09:13,276
(Second day, Ngong Ping Village, local food, cafe)

241
00:09:13,276 --> 00:09:14,743
(Incheon International Airport)

242
00:09:14,743 --> 00:09:17,176
(Takes 3.5 hours to Hong Kong)

243
00:09:20,143 --> 00:09:22,043
It's Hong Kong!

244
00:09:22,743 --> 00:09:24,510
Hong Kong!

245
00:09:25,176 --> 00:09:26,310
There's no one here.

246
00:09:26,543 --> 00:09:29,576
We're at Hong Kong!

247
00:09:29,576 --> 00:09:31,643
We're here.

248
00:09:31,643 --> 00:09:33,776
We have to go travel now

249
00:09:33,776 --> 00:09:35,410
so I prepared this.

250
00:09:35,410 --> 00:09:37,310
- You know I'll guide this tour. / - Yes.

251
00:09:38,443 --> 00:09:39,943
- What's that? / - Look here.

252
00:09:40,443 --> 00:09:43,910
No way...

253
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:45,543
You bought that?

254
00:09:45,543 --> 00:09:48,110
No, I had this at home.

255
00:09:48,110 --> 00:09:50,143
That's what the drill sergeants use.

256
00:09:50,143 --> 00:09:51,410
You're right.

257
00:09:51,410 --> 00:09:52,476
You bought this?

258
00:09:52,476 --> 00:09:55,043
No, I had this at home.

259
00:09:55,043 --> 00:09:56,310
It's buzzing.

260
00:09:56,310 --> 00:09:57,576
Just a minute.

261
00:09:59,076 --> 00:10:00,276
She's right beside you, you don't need a mic.

262
00:10:00,276 --> 00:10:02,643
This is welcoming us to Hong Kong?

263
00:10:03,443 --> 00:10:05,443
You have to hit it when it's not working.

264
00:10:05,976 --> 00:10:08,343
It's working now. I have to hit it to make it work.

265
00:10:08,343 --> 00:10:09,710
- Now... / - Where do we go now?

266
00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:12,710
This is the place you wanted to go.

267
00:10:12,710 --> 00:10:14,610
- I really wanted to go too. / - Our outfits...

268
00:10:15,976 --> 00:10:16,810
Is it where you think?

269
00:10:16,810 --> 00:10:18,876
- The perfect place for our outfit? / - High-five.

270
00:10:21,443 --> 00:10:23,143
Today, we're going to...

271
00:10:23,143 --> 00:10:25,743
- Disneyland! / - Let's go.

272
00:10:33,343 --> 00:10:34,576
What was that pose?

273
00:10:34,576 --> 00:10:36,676
- We have to get on a train. / - What?

274
00:10:36,676 --> 00:10:38,843
- Train. / - Yes, train.

275
00:10:38,843 --> 00:10:41,210
- Follow me, Moon Byul. / - I'm coming.

276
00:10:41,210 --> 00:10:43,676
The sparrow goes...

277
00:10:44,776 --> 00:10:48,310
(Sunny Bay Station, 10 minutes from the airport)

278
00:10:48,843 --> 00:10:52,376
(Sunny Bay Station)

279
00:10:53,443 --> 00:10:56,810
(There's a special train that goes to Disneyland?)

280
00:10:56,810 --> 00:10:59,876
- We're here to take the train. / - Yes.

281
00:10:59,876 --> 00:11:02,343
I'll tell you the details when it comes.

282
00:11:02,343 --> 00:11:03,676
It's here!

283
00:11:04,843 --> 00:11:07,143
This is it! It's the Mickey train.

284
00:11:07,143 --> 00:11:08,610
- It's so cute. / - What is that?

285
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:10,010
- Mickey Mouse? / - Yes, Mickey Mouse.

286
00:11:10,010 --> 00:11:11,176
It's so cute.

287
00:11:12,143 --> 00:11:14,610
- Really? / - It's only at Sunny Bay.

288
00:11:15,143 --> 00:11:16,643
- Mickey! / - Let's get on.

289
00:11:18,976 --> 00:11:20,243
The train is so cute.

290
00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:22,110
- Even the handles! / - So cute, right?

291
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:23,576
That's so cute.

292
00:11:23,576 --> 00:11:25,076
- That's in the train? / - Yes.

293
00:11:25,076 --> 00:11:27,610
I was so amazed how everything was Disney.

294
00:11:28,743 --> 00:11:30,676
This is amazing.

295
00:11:30,676 --> 00:11:32,410
- I feel like a kid again. / - Yes.

296
00:11:32,410 --> 00:11:34,710
- What was this called again? / - Look at the handles.

297
00:11:34,710 --> 00:11:35,843
It's Mickey.

298
00:11:35,843 --> 00:11:37,610
- Look at that. / - It's cute.

299
00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:41,510
- It will take only 3 minutes. / - Really?

300
00:11:41,510 --> 00:11:43,943
- It's really close. / - Because it needs to travel back.

301
00:11:44,310 --> 00:11:46,676
- It's only one station? / - Yes.

302
00:11:49,943 --> 00:11:55,710
(While they laughed and chatted, they have arrived)

303
00:11:55,710 --> 00:11:57,410
We're here.

304
00:11:57,410 --> 00:11:59,643
My goodness. We're here.

305
00:12:01,976 --> 00:12:04,376
We're in Disneyland.

306
00:12:04,376 --> 00:12:05,576
Disneyland.

307
00:12:05,576 --> 00:12:08,376
(Hong Kong Disneyland is located in Lantau Island)

308
00:12:08,376 --> 00:12:10,343
(Opened in 2005, it's the 5th Disneyland in the world)

309
00:12:12,476 --> 00:12:13,743
They even have Iron Man.

310
00:12:13,743 --> 00:12:17,376
(They have various attractions)

311
00:12:18,010 --> 00:12:19,676
There must be a lot of things to take pictures of.

312
00:12:19,676 --> 00:12:21,543
There were so many.

313
00:12:21,543 --> 00:12:24,576
I'd better pay extra attention to Hong Kong.

314
00:12:24,576 --> 00:12:27,276
We're now at the ticket office.

315
00:12:27,276 --> 00:12:30,010
I already bought our tickets and printed them out

316
00:12:30,010 --> 00:12:31,610
in Korea.

317
00:12:34,676 --> 00:12:37,143
- Thank you. Bye. / - Thank you.

318
00:12:38,310 --> 00:12:41,243
I think we should do something like...

319
00:12:41,243 --> 00:12:43,976
- You know? / - To fit in here?

320
00:12:43,976 --> 00:12:45,776
We need some styling.

321
00:12:46,610 --> 00:12:51,143
(Where are Moon Byul and Solar headed to?)

322
00:12:53,676 --> 00:12:56,976
♪ Let's get going, full of excitement ♪

323
00:12:57,710 --> 00:12:59,310
- Gosh, look at that hat. / - It's Mickey.

324
00:12:59,310 --> 00:13:01,543
- Solar, look at this. / - Mickey is everywhere.

325
00:13:03,276 --> 00:13:08,210
(The shop is full of cute souvenirs)

326
00:13:10,676 --> 00:13:12,276
There's so much there.

327
00:13:12,276 --> 00:13:14,043
(Impressed)

328
00:13:14,910 --> 00:13:16,476
I want to try this on.

329
00:13:16,476 --> 00:13:18,176
Isn't it supposed to be the other way?

330
00:13:18,176 --> 00:13:19,510
You have to wear those over there.

331
00:13:19,510 --> 00:13:21,843
- You need to. / - You're right.

332
00:13:21,843 --> 00:13:23,910
You should try this on.

333
00:13:24,743 --> 00:13:25,676
- It looks cute on her. / - How do I look?

334
00:13:27,843 --> 00:13:30,010
Children would love this place.

335
00:13:30,943 --> 00:13:33,310
There are so many things to buy.

336
00:13:33,643 --> 00:13:34,876
Open it.

337
00:13:36,143 --> 00:13:37,876
It's...

338
00:13:37,876 --> 00:13:39,310
That's incredible.

339
00:13:40,576 --> 00:13:41,910
Oh, my eyes.

340
00:13:43,343 --> 00:13:44,476
What are you doing?

341
00:13:44,476 --> 00:13:46,810
(Check out Solar and Moon Byul's fashion right now)

342
00:13:46,810 --> 00:13:48,810
I'm so curious as to what they bought.

343
00:13:49,376 --> 00:13:52,643
(On one sunny day)

344
00:13:52,976 --> 00:13:56,310
(Solar and Moon Byul show up on the street)

345
00:13:57,210 --> 00:13:58,676
It looks good on her.

346
00:14:01,610 --> 00:14:03,943
I have a Mickey watch and Mickey earrings....

347
00:14:03,943 --> 00:14:05,310
- Mickey earrings. / - Really?

348
00:14:07,043 --> 00:14:08,843
That was funny how you revealed the watch.

349
00:14:08,843 --> 00:14:10,543
We don't have that in Korea.

350
00:14:14,676 --> 00:14:17,043
- They're both good. / - They're good.

351
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:18,576
- Seriously. / - The items look good on them.

352
00:14:26,976 --> 00:14:29,043
A lot of people were watching us.

353
00:14:29,043 --> 00:14:30,543
They don't even come near you.

354
00:14:30,543 --> 00:14:32,110
You both look great though.

355
00:14:33,076 --> 00:14:38,276
(They try their best)

356
00:14:43,043 --> 00:14:44,743
This is what you call fashion.

357
00:14:46,276 --> 00:14:47,976
Now let's go.

358
00:14:48,543 --> 00:14:49,743
Mickey, let's go.

359
00:14:52,976 --> 00:14:55,410
(They seem very happy all dressed up)

360
00:14:55,410 --> 00:14:56,243
What?

361
00:14:56,243 --> 00:14:58,443
- We're dressed up. / - Okay.

362
00:14:58,443 --> 00:15:01,143
Shall we go meet the real Mickey?

363
00:15:01,143 --> 00:15:03,910
- Mickey. / - Mickey, where are you?

364
00:15:03,910 --> 00:15:06,310
- He must be over there. / - Let's go.

365
00:15:09,010 --> 00:15:13,010
(It's crowded here)

366
00:15:13,143 --> 00:15:14,210
Why are there so many people?

367
00:15:14,210 --> 00:15:14,976
For photos?

368
00:15:14,976 --> 00:15:17,410
Yes, to take photos with Mickey Mouse.

369
00:15:17,410 --> 00:15:19,976
So many people were lined up.

370
00:15:19,976 --> 00:15:22,243
We lined up as well.

371
00:15:23,876 --> 00:15:26,476
To take pictures, we need to stand in the line.

372
00:15:26,476 --> 00:15:28,476
- Are you sure it's here? / - Yes.

373
00:15:28,476 --> 00:15:31,143
- It's over there. / - This is the queue.

374
00:15:31,143 --> 00:15:32,843
Like this.

375
00:15:35,943 --> 00:15:38,810
- Mickey and Minnie, wait there. / - Okay.

376
00:15:38,810 --> 00:15:40,043
Did you have to wait long?

377
00:15:40,043 --> 00:15:41,410
We had to wait for ages.

378
00:15:44,176 --> 00:15:46,476
The queue doesn't seem to get any shorter.

379
00:15:46,476 --> 00:15:49,310
- This queue is so long. / - I'm sweating so much.

380
00:15:50,343 --> 00:15:51,543
There are two groups left.

381
00:15:55,143 --> 00:15:57,176
We can finally meet Mickey and Minnie soon.

382
00:15:57,176 --> 00:15:58,776
Mickey, Minnie, wait for us.

383
00:16:00,143 --> 00:16:01,843
Hi!

384
00:16:02,510 --> 00:16:03,776
- She sounds excited. / - Hello.

385
00:16:03,776 --> 00:16:05,510
- Solar seems happy. / - Oh, my God.

386
00:16:05,510 --> 00:16:06,910
- They seem excited too. / - Hi.

387
00:16:07,310 --> 00:16:09,610
1, 2, 3.

388
00:16:10,410 --> 00:16:12,776
I'd like to take pictures with them too.

389
00:16:12,776 --> 00:16:14,910
1, 2, 3.

390
00:16:15,943 --> 00:16:19,710
(They met Mickey and Minnie Mouse in person)

391
00:16:22,710 --> 00:16:25,910
(Where are they headed now?)

392
00:16:25,910 --> 00:16:27,710
Isn't this it?

393
00:16:27,710 --> 00:16:29,776
I think this is it. It's the roller coaster.

394
00:16:30,143 --> 00:16:32,276
- It seems so. / - But...

395
00:16:32,276 --> 00:16:34,876
I don't think it's as scary as we thought.

396
00:16:34,876 --> 00:16:36,676
It didn't look so scary?

397
00:16:36,676 --> 00:16:40,243
(It's a roller coaster in an American Western village)

398
00:16:41,476 --> 00:16:44,043
(The most popular attraction in the theme park)

399
00:16:44,043 --> 00:16:46,310
Isn't it pretty gentle?

400
00:16:46,310 --> 00:16:48,543
We are not so good with scary rides.

401
00:16:49,510 --> 00:16:50,943
We were quite scared.

402
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:52,810
This is how I go on rides.

403
00:16:52,810 --> 00:16:55,143
Solar, I do this.

404
00:16:55,143 --> 00:16:56,543
I always do this.

405
00:16:56,943 --> 00:16:58,310
Even if it does an upside down turn,

406
00:16:58,310 --> 00:16:59,443
I ride like this.

407
00:17:02,443 --> 00:17:04,776
She looks obviously nervous.

408
00:17:05,610 --> 00:17:08,576
What's wrong with your heart? It's beating so fast.

409
00:17:08,576 --> 00:17:10,610
♪ Bounce, bounce ♪

410
00:17:12,076 --> 00:17:13,243
She just can't stop.

411
00:17:17,410 --> 00:17:18,876
It's just the start.

412
00:17:19,943 --> 00:17:22,010
- The others are so calm. / - I can't ride that.

413
00:17:23,110 --> 00:17:25,876
(The roller coaster is slowly climbing to the top)

414
00:17:25,976 --> 00:17:27,610
The weather is nice.

415
00:17:27,676 --> 00:17:29,443
(Relaxed)

416
00:17:30,476 --> 00:17:32,176
- I'm scared. / - There's...

417
00:17:32,910 --> 00:17:34,410
- A surprise here. / - There's a surprise.

418
00:17:34,410 --> 00:17:35,576
What?

419
00:17:35,976 --> 00:17:39,210
- It must've been scary. / - It wasn't that scary...

420
00:17:39,210 --> 00:17:41,243
Until it suddenly started moving backwards.

421
00:17:41,443 --> 00:17:44,110
Why is it moving backwards?

422
00:17:47,210 --> 00:17:49,443
- Why is it moving backwards? / - Are you smiling?

423
00:17:49,443 --> 00:17:51,176
Or are you crying? Which is it?

424
00:17:51,176 --> 00:17:52,876
Look at them.

425
00:17:56,276 --> 00:17:58,110
- Your mouth is wide open. / - Was I like that?

426
00:18:04,043 --> 00:18:05,276
I was so surprised.

427
00:18:06,143 --> 00:18:07,676
- What? / - What's going on?

428
00:18:09,010 --> 00:18:11,443
It goes back and forth.

429
00:18:13,210 --> 00:18:15,676
Solar's face is the most terrifying thing here.

430
00:18:16,176 --> 00:18:18,076
It was so scary.

431
00:18:22,410 --> 00:18:24,843
They are so loud. All the others are doing this.

432
00:18:25,643 --> 00:18:27,543
The front seats are the least scariest.

433
00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:32,576
(The roller coaster speeds up out of the cave)

434
00:18:33,176 --> 00:18:35,376
(Moon Byul's face is hidden)

435
00:18:38,976 --> 00:18:40,110
Oh, my...

436
00:18:41,676 --> 00:18:43,076
At least she closed her mouth now.

437
00:18:48,910 --> 00:18:50,976
(Glancing)

438
00:18:52,410 --> 00:18:53,276
You're angry there, right, Sola?

439
00:18:54,176 --> 00:18:55,876
It was pretty scary.

440
00:18:55,876 --> 00:18:57,743
People are clapping and are all happy.

441
00:18:58,310 --> 00:19:01,543
(Blank)

442
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:06,610
- My throat hurts. / - I'm dizzy.

443
00:19:11,243 --> 00:19:12,776
Solar, where did all your joy go?

444
00:19:13,976 --> 00:19:16,110
- Was it really scary? / - It was.

445
00:19:19,010 --> 00:19:20,543
What's over there?

446
00:19:20,543 --> 00:19:22,010
- Where? / - It must be "Toy Story."

447
00:19:27,376 --> 00:19:28,610
It looks amazing.

448
00:19:34,043 --> 00:19:36,776
A full day must not be enough there.

449
00:19:36,776 --> 00:19:38,410
- It was huge. / - It was indeed.

450
00:19:40,076 --> 00:19:42,110
One should enter the park as soon as it opens.

451
00:19:42,110 --> 00:19:46,176
I feel like I'm in the toy world.

452
00:19:46,176 --> 00:19:48,210
I feel like I'm back in my childhood.

453
00:19:49,976 --> 00:19:53,010
Even the toilet is made of toys.

454
00:19:54,510 --> 00:19:56,576
- Look at this. / - It's really well made.

455
00:19:58,176 --> 00:20:00,543
Everything is made of toys. Come and have a look.

456
00:20:00,543 --> 00:20:02,210
- I have Woody at home. / - Woody.

457
00:20:03,043 --> 00:20:04,276
Woody.

458
00:20:04,643 --> 00:20:06,876
- She just calls his name out. / - Woody.

459
00:20:06,876 --> 00:20:09,010
You're posing.

460
00:20:09,010 --> 00:20:10,443
Woody.

461
00:20:10,443 --> 00:20:12,076
Woody is so cute.

462
00:20:12,776 --> 00:20:16,976
(Toy Story land seems peaceful)

463
00:20:16,976 --> 00:20:18,610
(Screaming)

464
00:20:19,976 --> 00:20:21,110
What happened?

465
00:20:22,143 --> 00:20:24,876
(Toy Story land seems peaceful)

466
00:20:24,876 --> 00:20:26,376
(Screaming)

467
00:20:26,376 --> 00:20:27,643
My gosh. What's that?

468
00:20:30,176 --> 00:20:32,943
- But that doesn't look so scary. / - This one was...

469
00:20:34,376 --> 00:20:35,976
It went so high up.

470
00:20:37,610 --> 00:20:39,543
Solar, your mouth is so big.

471
00:20:42,143 --> 00:20:44,610
(Her mouth is wide open again)

472
00:20:49,143 --> 00:20:50,843
That one doesn't look so scary though.

473
00:20:50,843 --> 00:20:53,876
This one was scarier.

474
00:20:53,876 --> 00:20:56,776
- I'll lose your voice. / - I lost my voice that day.

475
00:20:58,476 --> 00:21:01,110
(They noisily finished enjoying all the attractions)

476
00:21:01,110 --> 00:21:03,776
- What an amazing sound. / - Sounded like a dentist.

477
00:21:05,876 --> 00:21:09,243
- I'm getting hungry. / - I'm very hungry now.

478
00:21:09,476 --> 00:21:12,176
Shall we go eat now? Where should we go?

479
00:21:12,176 --> 00:21:14,910
Which restaurant should we go?

480
00:21:14,910 --> 00:21:16,843
Where should we go?

481
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:18,476
How about...

482
00:21:18,476 --> 00:21:21,243
Let's have a look over there. I see a menu.

483
00:21:21,243 --> 00:21:23,210
Alright. Let's go.

484
00:21:24,043 --> 00:21:25,943
Let's go. Let's go.

485
00:21:25,943 --> 00:21:27,776
I wonder what they sell.

486
00:21:27,776 --> 00:21:30,510
The visuals and details are different.

487
00:21:30,510 --> 00:21:31,676
- If you look... / - Really?

488
00:21:33,276 --> 00:21:35,343
Food is here!

489
00:21:35,343 --> 00:21:36,876
It's food.

490
00:21:36,876 --> 00:21:38,876
We're finally having food.

491
00:21:41,976 --> 00:21:42,676
The visuals...

492
00:21:42,676 --> 00:21:44,576
It's a Mickey Mouse pizza.

493
00:21:44,576 --> 00:21:45,743
That's so cruel.

494
00:21:47,010 --> 00:21:48,310
So you're eating his face?

495
00:21:48,310 --> 00:21:50,410
- From the ear. / - Starting with the ear.

496
00:21:50,410 --> 00:21:52,276
(Rice topped with pork, $19)

497
00:21:52,276 --> 00:21:54,210
(Mickey Mouse pizza, $18)

498
00:21:54,210 --> 00:21:57,210
There's Italian, Thai...

499
00:21:57,210 --> 00:21:59,076
- Lots of international dishes. / - Really?

500
00:22:01,176 --> 00:22:03,476
- We just have to charge on. / - Okay.

501
00:22:03,476 --> 00:22:04,743
Let me cut it.

502
00:22:05,510 --> 00:22:07,143
It's somewhat cruel.

503
00:22:07,143 --> 00:22:07,843
It's quite big.

504
00:22:07,843 --> 00:22:11,143
- Let me taste one ear. / - Let's try it.

505
00:22:11,143 --> 00:22:13,710
- To Hong Kong. / - Cheers.

506
00:22:13,710 --> 00:22:14,843
To Hong Kong.

507
00:22:16,843 --> 00:22:17,776
It's good.

508
00:22:18,476 --> 00:22:21,076
- It was really good. / - Yes, it was very tasty.

509
00:22:21,076 --> 00:22:25,010
I like that the dough is thin.

510
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:26,010
It's like chips.

511
00:22:26,010 --> 00:22:27,510
It's so crispy.

512
00:22:29,043 --> 00:22:30,743
It's tasty.

513
00:22:30,743 --> 00:22:31,543
It's somewhat

514
00:22:31,543 --> 00:22:33,643
cruel though.

515
00:22:33,643 --> 00:22:34,876
We were complimenting on how cute...

516
00:22:34,876 --> 00:22:37,343
- Mickey's ears are. / - That's so funny.

517
00:22:37,343 --> 00:22:38,243
And we just cut them.

518
00:22:38,976 --> 00:22:41,843
We're so into Mickey today.

519
00:22:44,076 --> 00:22:49,476
(Rice topped with pork is tasty as well)

520
00:22:49,976 --> 00:22:51,276
Is that rice?

521
00:22:51,276 --> 00:22:53,676
It was risotto.

522
00:22:53,676 --> 00:22:55,443
Both the dishes were tasty.

523
00:22:55,443 --> 00:22:58,010
- It was a good restaurant. / - Yes, it was.

524
00:22:58,010 --> 00:22:59,576
How is it?

525
00:22:59,576 --> 00:23:01,576
- It's good. / - I want to try it too.

526
00:23:01,876 --> 00:23:04,843
(She takes a big bite)

527
00:23:07,843 --> 00:23:09,643
- I was worried... / - It's so tasty.

528
00:23:09,643 --> 00:23:12,610
- That the food wouldn't be good. / - Me too.

529
00:23:12,610 --> 00:23:13,610
But it's good.

530
00:23:13,610 --> 00:23:15,976
All the dishes are tasty.

531
00:23:17,910 --> 00:23:22,643
(They gobble up the food)

532
00:23:24,076 --> 00:23:25,076
- It looks really tasty. / - It looks tasty.

533
00:23:27,210 --> 00:23:29,410
- It wasn't there before. / - What? Only in Hong Kong?

534
00:23:32,210 --> 00:23:33,910
The theme seems to be space.

535
00:23:41,876 --> 00:23:43,376
That, that, that, that!

536
00:23:44,476 --> 00:23:45,376
Iron Man.

537
00:23:46,143 --> 00:23:48,710
Make sure you get the fast pass.

538
00:23:48,710 --> 00:23:50,576
- Did you get them? / - Yes.

539
00:23:50,576 --> 00:23:52,810
We got them when we checked in.

540
00:23:52,810 --> 00:23:54,210
With them, you don't need to queue.

541
00:23:55,976 --> 00:23:59,343
We checked in at the hotel

542
00:23:59,343 --> 00:24:00,810
before we begin our trip.

543
00:24:00,810 --> 00:24:02,176
Is the hotel in the park?

544
00:24:02,176 --> 00:24:03,343
- Yes. / - Yes.

545
00:24:03,843 --> 00:24:06,343
- Check in. / - Here it is.

546
00:24:06,343 --> 00:24:07,710
Some information cards.

547
00:24:07,710 --> 00:24:09,476
Very pretty card.

548
00:24:09,476 --> 00:24:10,943
It's a little expensive

549
00:24:10,943 --> 00:24:12,610
but it gives you a lot of benefits.

550
00:24:12,610 --> 00:24:14,610
- I see. / - Fast pass tickets.

551
00:24:16,410 --> 00:24:18,943
It includes the free pass tickets including the resort?

552
00:24:18,943 --> 00:24:21,643
Yes, I thought one day of luxury was good.

553
00:24:21,643 --> 00:24:23,610
Free pass tickets are already costly.

554
00:24:23,610 --> 00:24:24,976
Thank you.

555
00:24:27,143 --> 00:24:30,810
(This is the only place one can meet Iron Man)

556
00:24:32,743 --> 00:24:34,543
It looks amazing.

557
00:24:34,543 --> 00:24:35,443
What is that?

558
00:24:35,443 --> 00:24:37,476
Even adult men would love that place.

559
00:24:38,776 --> 00:24:41,343
Let's go meet Iron Man.

560
00:24:41,343 --> 00:24:42,943
He's putting on his suit now.

561
00:24:42,943 --> 00:24:45,043
He's waiting for us now.

562
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:49,476
I was good at this when I was in high school.

563
00:24:49,476 --> 00:24:50,476
On the bars, right?

564
00:24:54,510 --> 00:24:57,010
I'm so excited to see Iron Man.

565
00:24:57,010 --> 00:24:58,743
You two seem to really get along.

566
00:25:00,710 --> 00:25:02,043
My goodness.

567
00:25:02,510 --> 00:25:04,910
(Staying alert)

568
00:25:06,810 --> 00:25:08,510
Iron Man!

569
00:25:08,510 --> 00:25:10,876
- Iron Man. / - Where are you?

570
00:25:12,976 --> 00:25:15,376
- This must be his base. / - This is his base.

571
00:25:17,376 --> 00:25:18,576
Let's watch.

572
00:25:20,610 --> 00:25:21,910
It's not just for children.

573
00:25:21,910 --> 00:25:24,143
- I'd like to go there too. / - Looking like that...

574
00:25:26,076 --> 00:25:28,676
Let's go save Hong Kong.

575
00:25:32,243 --> 00:25:33,810
It's from Iron Man's perspective.

576
00:25:33,810 --> 00:25:35,210
Yes, it was really fun.

577
00:25:35,210 --> 00:25:38,243
Being 3D, imagine how immersive it'd be.

578
00:25:43,810 --> 00:25:47,876
(Seems like they're still being attacked)

579
00:25:47,876 --> 00:25:49,576
No! No!

580
00:25:52,976 --> 00:25:55,376
We were avoiding the enemies.

581
00:25:58,476 --> 00:26:00,243
Hong Kong is safe now.

582
00:26:00,243 --> 00:26:01,276
It's safe.

583
00:26:04,476 --> 00:26:06,543
- This is... / - This is where we can see Iron Man.

584
00:26:06,543 --> 00:26:08,310
- This is... / - And take photos.

585
00:26:08,310 --> 00:26:10,343
I recommend this place so much.

586
00:26:10,876 --> 00:26:12,010
You guys ready?

587
00:26:12,010 --> 00:26:13,443
- Yeah. / - Yeah, perfect.

588
00:26:13,443 --> 00:26:14,443
What's going on?

589
00:26:14,443 --> 00:26:15,876
(Where is he?)

590
00:26:17,276 --> 00:26:19,676
(Iron Man is landing)

591
00:26:19,676 --> 00:26:20,676
- He comes down? / - Iron Man!

592
00:26:20,676 --> 00:26:22,610
Yes, you can really see the silhouette landing.

593
00:26:24,010 --> 00:26:25,343
Iron Man!

594
00:26:25,343 --> 00:26:26,176
I got goose bumps.

595
00:26:38,310 --> 00:26:39,676
Iron Man.

596
00:26:39,676 --> 00:26:41,910
- Goose bumps.  / - It was cool. It was really cool.

597
00:26:45,210 --> 00:26:46,776
I seriously got goose bumps.

598
00:26:47,743 --> 00:26:49,576
Seoeon and Seojun would love this, wouldn't they?

599
00:26:49,576 --> 00:26:50,943
- It would be more than that. / - Right?

600
00:26:50,943 --> 00:26:52,243
It'd be like their birthday.

601
00:26:52,243 --> 00:26:53,943
You should go there once.

602
00:26:53,943 --> 00:26:55,510
You look very hot.

603
00:26:55,510 --> 00:26:57,343
Iron Man, I'm so happy.

604
00:26:57,343 --> 00:26:59,410
Standing here talking to Iron Man

605
00:26:59,410 --> 00:27:01,343
and your answer wasn't awesome?

606
00:27:01,343 --> 00:27:03,076
Okay, I'll try not to be offended.

607
00:27:03,076 --> 00:27:04,976
- Yeah. / - Yep, take it easy.

608
00:27:04,976 --> 00:27:06,476
Do you know MAMAMOO?

609
00:27:08,843 --> 00:27:09,876
Yes.

610
00:27:10,143 --> 00:27:11,310
What?

611
00:27:13,176 --> 00:27:15,543
It's Robert Downey Jr.'s voice.

612
00:27:16,276 --> 00:27:18,543
He was talking in that voice.

613
00:27:18,543 --> 00:27:19,676
Yes, we could actually communicate with him.

614
00:27:19,676 --> 00:27:20,743
- Really? / - Yes.

615
00:27:20,943 --> 00:27:22,010
Search.

616
00:27:22,276 --> 00:27:23,976
You should search.

617
00:27:23,976 --> 00:27:25,010
Yeah.

618
00:27:25,010 --> 00:27:26,610
Search MAMAMOO.

619
00:27:27,676 --> 00:27:28,976
- Okay. / - Okay?

620
00:27:29,976 --> 00:27:31,210
Absolutely.

621
00:27:31,210 --> 00:27:32,910
Iron Man seems to be flustered.

622
00:27:32,910 --> 00:27:34,010
- He's surprised. / - Yes.

623
00:27:34,010 --> 00:27:36,310
Thanks to you, Hong Kong is safe.

624
00:27:37,643 --> 00:27:39,710
Thank you for saving Hong Kong.

625
00:27:39,710 --> 00:27:41,443
Thank you.

626
00:27:42,310 --> 00:27:46,510
(They took pictures with the Iron Man)

627
00:27:46,510 --> 00:27:48,010
It's like he's grabbing you saying,

628
00:27:48,010 --> 00:27:49,210
"Please pipe down and just take the photo."

629
00:27:50,076 --> 00:27:52,043
- Iron Man looks a little tired. / - He does, right?

630
00:27:56,843 --> 00:27:59,276
We ran into Star Wars characters as well.

631
00:27:59,276 --> 00:28:00,643
That's nice.

632
00:28:01,676 --> 00:28:02,710
You took a lot of nice pictures.

633
00:28:02,710 --> 00:28:04,276
Yes, we were so happy.

634
00:28:05,043 --> 00:28:05,843
Awesome.

635
00:28:05,843 --> 00:28:08,110
Then we went to watch "Lion King."

636
00:28:08,110 --> 00:28:09,276
That sounds fun.

637
00:28:13,376 --> 00:28:16,176
I feel like we're suddenly in nature.

638
00:28:16,176 --> 00:28:17,743
Seriously, there are a lot of themes.

639
00:28:19,643 --> 00:28:22,376
This place is huge.

640
00:28:22,376 --> 00:28:23,510
What should we...

641
00:28:24,510 --> 00:28:26,210
- It's really huge here. / - I'm confused.

642
00:28:26,210 --> 00:28:27,410
We should...

643
00:28:28,876 --> 00:28:32,176
It seems like there's a Korean guide as well.

644
00:28:32,843 --> 00:28:34,276
- Hello. / - Hello.

645
00:28:34,276 --> 00:28:35,610
Do you speak Korean?

646
00:28:35,610 --> 00:28:38,310
I'm a guide who can speak Korean.

647
00:28:41,310 --> 00:28:42,643
Is she from Hong Kong?

648
00:28:42,643 --> 00:28:43,510
- Yes. / - Yes.

649
00:28:44,276 --> 00:28:45,810
We would like to

650
00:28:45,810 --> 00:28:48,243
watch "Lion King."

651
00:28:48,243 --> 00:28:49,710
But we don't know where it is.

652
00:28:49,710 --> 00:28:51,676
You can go straight this way.

653
00:28:51,676 --> 00:28:52,776
- This way? / - This way?

654
00:28:52,776 --> 00:28:54,043
Your Korean is really good.

655
00:28:54,043 --> 00:28:56,076
- You speak Korean very well. / - Thank you.

656
00:28:56,076 --> 00:28:58,843
I'm somehow happy and touched.

657
00:28:58,843 --> 00:29:00,543
I'm happy to meet someone who speaks Korean.

658
00:29:00,543 --> 00:29:02,543
Just seeing Korean writing overseas makes you happy.

659
00:29:02,543 --> 00:29:04,010
- Thank you. / - Have a nice day.

660
00:29:04,010 --> 00:29:05,143
- Thank you. / - Thank you.

661
00:29:05,143 --> 00:29:06,210
- This way? / - Yes.

662
00:29:06,210 --> 00:29:07,543
It must feel weird to hear that kind of

663
00:29:07,543 --> 00:29:08,743
Korean greeting from a foreigner.

664
00:29:09,876 --> 00:29:12,176
- Thank you. / - You must have felt relieved.

665
00:29:12,176 --> 00:29:13,676
I'm so glad that we met her.

666
00:29:13,676 --> 00:29:15,543
I was very happy.

667
00:29:17,476 --> 00:29:20,443
This is where "Lion King" takes place.

668
00:29:20,443 --> 00:29:21,910
A lion is welcoming us.

669
00:29:21,910 --> 00:29:23,043
Hello, lion.

670
00:29:28,776 --> 00:29:30,210
Lion.

671
00:29:30,210 --> 00:29:31,976
Lion King.

672
00:29:31,976 --> 00:29:33,976
- It looks fun. / - I want to be there too.

673
00:29:33,976 --> 00:29:34,976
It was amazing.

674
00:29:34,976 --> 00:29:36,376
- It was fascinating. / - Was it like a musical?

675
00:29:36,376 --> 00:29:37,243
- Yes. / - Yes.

676
00:29:37,543 --> 00:29:38,576
It's beginning.

677
00:29:43,710 --> 00:29:44,576
It's a live performance.

678
00:29:44,576 --> 00:29:46,576
I told you it looked like a live performance.

679
00:29:46,576 --> 00:29:48,076
You didn't hear me, did you?

680
00:29:48,076 --> 00:29:49,276
I thought it wouldn't be.

681
00:29:53,910 --> 00:29:56,210
It looks fabulous.

682
00:29:56,876 --> 00:29:57,943
I got goose bumps.

683
00:29:58,210 --> 00:30:02,143
(This show is particularly popular among Koreans)

684
00:30:04,843 --> 00:30:09,676
(You can enjoy acrobatics as well)

685
00:30:14,643 --> 00:30:16,910
I get goose bumps even by watching it on screen.

686
00:30:19,676 --> 00:30:21,643
It was real fire...

687
00:30:21,643 --> 00:30:23,910
They kept spinning on both sides.

688
00:30:25,910 --> 00:30:32,810
(Simba regains peace and the show ends happily)

689
00:30:34,476 --> 00:30:35,943
- Hi. / - Hello.

690
00:30:35,943 --> 00:30:41,810
(The performance ends with high-fives from the actors)

691
00:30:43,810 --> 00:30:46,443
I recommend you sit right in the front.

692
00:30:46,443 --> 00:30:49,443
You can high-five with the actors there.

693
00:30:49,443 --> 00:30:52,010
- You can connect with the actors. / - That's right.

694
00:30:52,010 --> 00:30:53,243
It looks amazing.

695
00:30:54,710 --> 00:30:56,143
It's time to eat something.

696
00:30:56,143 --> 00:30:58,910
Tell me how hungry you are.

697
00:31:00,210 --> 00:31:01,343
Okay. You're very hungry.

698
00:31:01,343 --> 00:31:02,476
- Could you hear me? / - Yes.

699
00:31:02,476 --> 00:31:04,010
Let's go eat something.

700
00:31:04,010 --> 00:31:05,243
Let's eat something and...

701
00:31:06,076 --> 00:31:08,976
I heard there will be a night parade here later.

702
00:31:11,376 --> 00:31:13,010
It's so beautiful.

703
00:31:13,010 --> 00:31:14,210
You shouldn't miss that.

704
00:31:14,210 --> 00:31:15,676
- It's so cute. / - This is the highlight.

705
00:31:15,676 --> 00:31:17,510
- It's a must. / - I love you!

706
00:31:17,510 --> 00:31:18,776
I love you!

707
00:31:19,543 --> 00:31:21,643
- Hello. / - Hello.

708
00:31:21,643 --> 00:31:23,376
I love you! Yeah!

709
00:31:24,043 --> 00:31:25,443
They looked at us!

710
00:31:25,443 --> 00:31:26,576
They pointed at my hairband.

711
00:31:29,876 --> 00:31:32,043
After we eat something, it will be the perfect time

712
00:31:32,043 --> 00:31:32,910
to watch the parade.

713
00:31:36,810 --> 00:31:38,243
Should we go over there?

714
00:31:39,043 --> 00:31:41,310
- Okay. Let's go. / - Let's go and fill our stomachs.

715
00:31:41,310 --> 00:31:42,510
Okay.

716
00:31:42,510 --> 00:31:43,910
- It looks nice. / - This place looks nice.

717
00:31:43,910 --> 00:31:47,076
We're going to eat something special today.

718
00:31:47,076 --> 00:31:47,910
What is it?

719
00:31:47,910 --> 00:31:51,243
Battle Trip has been to Hong Kong many times.

720
00:31:51,243 --> 00:31:52,176
Right.

721
00:31:52,176 --> 00:31:55,010
When you go to Hong Kong, you eat dim sum.

722
00:31:55,010 --> 00:31:55,576
Right.

723
00:31:58,676 --> 00:32:00,743
They had dim sum every time.

724
00:32:03,376 --> 00:32:07,443
But there's something special about our dim sum.

725
00:32:07,443 --> 00:32:09,676
The dim sum we're having

726
00:32:09,676 --> 00:32:11,176
is not normal dim sum.

727
00:32:11,176 --> 00:32:14,410
- Does it look like Mickey Mouse? / - It's different.

728
00:32:14,410 --> 00:32:16,776
It's very unique.

729
00:32:20,010 --> 00:32:21,010
It's here.

730
00:32:22,176 --> 00:32:23,976
Their reactions are so good.

731
00:32:27,243 --> 00:32:29,143
- What is it? / - I was very surprised.

732
00:32:30,010 --> 00:32:31,910
- What is it? / - It's Olaf!

733
00:32:33,176 --> 00:32:34,210
It's Olaf.

734
00:32:38,210 --> 00:32:40,110
They made Olaf with dim sum?

735
00:32:40,110 --> 00:32:42,310
- They were all characters. / - There was Baymax.

736
00:32:42,310 --> 00:32:43,343
That's amazing.

737
00:32:45,010 --> 00:32:46,776
- Isn't it so pretty? / - Kids will love it.

738
00:32:46,776 --> 00:32:48,610
They'll be excited to see that.

739
00:32:48,610 --> 00:32:51,510
(Little Green Men bun, $12)

740
00:32:51,510 --> 00:32:58,076
(You can only enjoy this special dim sum here)

741
00:32:59,343 --> 00:33:01,010
It's a lunch menu

742
00:33:01,010 --> 00:33:03,943
but they cooked it especially for us for dinner.

743
00:33:03,943 --> 00:33:05,176
If you're watching this on TV,

744
00:33:05,176 --> 00:33:07,843
remember you can only have this at lunch.

745
00:33:07,843 --> 00:33:09,643
How would you eat it though?

746
00:33:09,643 --> 00:33:11,943
- It's so pretty. / - It was too cute to eat.

747
00:33:11,943 --> 00:33:13,410
Do you want to try this Olaf?

748
00:33:13,410 --> 00:33:15,043
Olaf?

749
00:33:15,043 --> 00:33:17,043
How do we eat it?

750
00:33:17,043 --> 00:33:19,076
How do we?

751
00:33:19,076 --> 00:33:19,910
Just grab him.

752
00:33:19,910 --> 00:33:22,376
He's staring at me. How can I eat him?

753
00:33:22,376 --> 00:33:23,643
Then eat his eyes first.

754
00:33:27,243 --> 00:33:28,810
It's red bean.

755
00:33:30,276 --> 00:33:31,443
Gosh, look at this.

756
00:33:34,743 --> 00:33:35,743
What's that?

757
00:33:38,643 --> 00:33:40,510
Is it okay to air this? Isn't it too cruel?

758
00:33:42,243 --> 00:33:43,010
What's this?

759
00:33:47,143 --> 00:33:48,143
It's okay.

760
00:33:49,410 --> 00:33:50,410
It's good.

761
00:33:52,410 --> 00:33:54,110
I like the red bean.

762
00:33:54,110 --> 00:33:56,376
- Me too. / - It tastes like steamed bun.

763
00:33:56,376 --> 00:33:59,410
But this one looks a lot cuter.

764
00:33:59,410 --> 00:34:02,143
- So visually it tastes better. / - It really is cute.

765
00:34:02,143 --> 00:34:03,143
And it's good.

766
00:34:03,976 --> 00:34:05,210
And it's good.

767
00:34:05,210 --> 00:34:07,510
This one smells different. It's Star Wars.

768
00:34:09,176 --> 00:34:14,843
(Star Wars bun, $9.70)

769
00:34:18,376 --> 00:34:19,876
Can you eat this? Don't you feel sorry?

770
00:34:22,543 --> 00:34:23,876
You bit off the head first.

771
00:34:25,776 --> 00:34:28,310
That's right. This is manju.

772
00:34:28,310 --> 00:34:30,743
It has nuts in it.

773
00:34:30,743 --> 00:34:33,076
- It tastes like cinnamon. / - Right.

774
00:34:33,443 --> 00:34:35,343
- It smells like cinnamon. / - That looks good.

775
00:34:35,343 --> 00:34:36,643
It looks delicious.

776
00:34:36,643 --> 00:34:39,276
It's crispy on the outside. When you take a bite..

777
00:34:39,943 --> 00:34:42,376
It's crispy like cookies

778
00:34:42,376 --> 00:34:43,410
but then it goes like this in your mouth...

779
00:34:44,643 --> 00:34:46,143
You should show us.

780
00:34:46,143 --> 00:34:47,643
It's really fun to eat them.

781
00:34:47,643 --> 00:34:49,410
- It's hard to explain. / - Since each ones different.

782
00:34:52,510 --> 00:34:55,543
Okay. It's in your mouth.

783
00:34:55,543 --> 00:34:57,976
(Melting)

784
00:34:57,976 --> 00:34:59,743
It's still there? It's not melting.

785
00:35:01,943 --> 00:35:04,576
The dim sums look so cute.

786
00:35:04,576 --> 00:35:05,576
What is this?

787
00:35:06,243 --> 00:35:07,976
It's from "Big Hero 6."

788
00:35:07,976 --> 00:35:10,476
- "Hello, I'm Baymax." / - Oh, "Big Hero 6."

789
00:35:10,476 --> 00:35:11,976
- It's so cute. / - Baymax.

790
00:35:11,976 --> 00:35:14,510
- I didn't know Baymax was so small. / - It's cute.

791
00:35:15,476 --> 00:35:16,476
Baymax is pretty big in the movie.

792
00:35:16,476 --> 00:35:18,176
He blows up, like this.

793
00:35:18,843 --> 00:35:21,810
I'm sorry but I have to eat you. I'm sorry.

794
00:35:23,276 --> 00:35:25,943
You might as well not say that.

795
00:35:25,943 --> 00:35:27,676
This one tastes good.

796
00:35:27,676 --> 00:35:30,043
It has nuts and meat in it.

797
00:35:30,043 --> 00:35:33,176
- Like... / - It tastes like dumplings.

798
00:35:33,176 --> 00:35:35,410
- It tastes like that. / - It tastes just like dumplings.

799
00:35:37,576 --> 00:35:39,410
It's very detailed.

800
00:35:40,910 --> 00:35:43,410
(What does this one taste like?)

801
00:35:44,276 --> 00:35:45,576
It tastes like a dumpling.

802
00:35:47,443 --> 00:35:48,510
This is good.

803
00:35:49,543 --> 00:35:50,543
This is really good.

804
00:35:50,543 --> 00:35:54,376
- It has meat and vegetables in it... / - You're right.

805
00:35:54,376 --> 00:35:56,310
This is actual dumpling filling.

806
00:35:57,876 --> 00:36:01,176
(The special dim sum pleases their eyes and mouths)

807
00:36:01,310 --> 00:36:04,243
I don't think I'll order it unless I become a father.

808
00:36:06,476 --> 00:36:08,810
We'll enjoy it with the babies.

809
00:36:10,343 --> 00:36:11,343
Thank you.

810
00:36:11,610 --> 00:36:14,676
- This is... / - This is suckling pig.

811
00:36:16,410 --> 00:36:17,843
It's really good.

812
00:36:17,843 --> 00:36:19,076
- I love it. / - It's great.

813
00:36:19,076 --> 00:36:20,510
Is this a course meal?

814
00:36:20,510 --> 00:36:21,843
I love that.

815
00:36:23,543 --> 00:36:25,443
Look at the carrot.

816
00:36:25,443 --> 00:36:26,810
The carrot is Mickey.

817
00:36:26,810 --> 00:36:27,943
Oh, my. Oh, my.

818
00:36:28,476 --> 00:36:29,443
Such details.

819
00:36:29,443 --> 00:36:31,076
(Cute)

820
00:36:32,010 --> 00:36:33,410
It smells like chips.

821
00:36:33,410 --> 00:36:36,010
It goes really well with rice.

822
00:36:36,010 --> 00:36:37,076
I can eat it forever.

823
00:36:37,076 --> 00:36:38,276
- Is it good? / - It was amazing.

824
00:36:38,276 --> 00:36:39,576
It's like chips on the top.

825
00:36:39,576 --> 00:36:40,776
Right. It's very crispy.

826
00:36:40,776 --> 00:36:42,576
- It's soft. / - That's so delicious.

827
00:36:43,610 --> 00:36:45,543
- It's crispy on the outside. / - This is really good.

828
00:36:45,543 --> 00:36:46,810
And it's soft inside.

829
00:36:46,810 --> 00:36:49,710
- It looks like bread crusts. / - It's so soft.

830
00:36:52,810 --> 00:36:54,043
- That'd be so good. / - Looks so good.

831
00:36:54,410 --> 00:36:56,143
It's savory like scorched rice.

832
00:36:56,710 --> 00:36:57,310
It's good.

833
00:36:57,310 --> 00:37:01,110
- When you flip it over... / - That's good in Hong Kong.

834
00:37:01,110 --> 00:37:02,143
- It's like... / - It's very tender inside.

835
00:37:02,143 --> 00:37:03,843
It's really tender.

836
00:37:06,543 --> 00:37:07,543
It feels like...

837
00:37:08,810 --> 00:37:10,810
Everything is good.

838
00:37:10,810 --> 00:37:12,876
- But we should eat rice. / - Right.

839
00:37:12,876 --> 00:37:15,243
- Should we order a rice dish? / - Sounds good.

840
00:37:17,110 --> 00:37:18,410
Excuse me.

841
00:37:19,910 --> 00:37:22,743
Do you have rice?

842
00:37:22,743 --> 00:37:24,276
- Rice? / - Rice.

843
00:37:24,343 --> 00:37:26,010
Okay. Steamed rice?

844
00:37:26,143 --> 00:37:27,176
No.

845
00:37:27,510 --> 00:37:28,510
- Mixed... / - Fried rice?

846
00:37:28,510 --> 00:37:30,776
- Yes. Fried. / - Fried rice.

847
00:37:30,776 --> 00:37:32,176
Okay. Anything else?

848
00:37:32,343 --> 00:37:33,343
No, thanks.

849
00:37:33,343 --> 00:37:36,076
That was just appropriate. "No, thanks."

850
00:37:36,076 --> 00:37:37,210
"No, thanks."

851
00:37:37,810 --> 00:37:40,310
- Your English is good. / - Right?

852
00:37:40,310 --> 00:37:41,976
I was good, right?

853
00:37:41,976 --> 00:37:43,610
I didn't know you'd say, "No, thanks."

854
00:37:43,610 --> 00:37:45,543
- People usually just say no. / - That's right.

855
00:37:48,210 --> 00:37:50,776
Thank you.

856
00:37:51,443 --> 00:37:57,143
(Chinese-style fried rice with scallops, $27)

857
00:37:59,710 --> 00:38:02,143
- Hong Kong's fried rice is true fried rice. / - Right.

858
00:38:02,276 --> 00:38:03,876
It was really good.

859
00:38:07,976 --> 00:38:09,943
Is this anchovy?

860
00:38:11,310 --> 00:38:12,610
It's anchovy and egg.

861
00:38:13,243 --> 00:38:14,410
I think that's what's in it.

862
00:38:17,276 --> 00:38:20,043
I wish they had kimchi here.

863
00:38:20,043 --> 00:38:21,643
That'd be nice.

864
00:38:21,643 --> 00:38:25,543
We just love kimchi.

865
00:38:25,543 --> 00:38:27,010
Everything is good.

866
00:38:27,010 --> 00:38:28,576
With something more...

867
00:38:28,576 --> 00:38:31,576
It could be the perfect dinner.

868
00:38:31,576 --> 00:38:32,610
Really?

869
00:38:33,343 --> 00:38:34,476
You want?

870
00:38:34,476 --> 00:38:37,510
- Without kimchi... / - Say, "Kimchi please."

871
00:38:37,510 --> 00:38:38,510
No way.

872
00:38:40,143 --> 00:38:41,210
- Pray for it. Kimchi please. / - To who?

873
00:38:41,210 --> 00:38:43,443
Kimchi please.

874
00:38:43,443 --> 00:38:44,543
I've heard your prayers.

875
00:38:47,210 --> 00:38:50,310
"I've heard your prayers."

876
00:38:50,876 --> 00:38:52,010
I've heard your prayers.

877
00:38:52,210 --> 00:38:55,676
(Dreams do come true)

878
00:38:57,043 --> 00:38:58,743
I brought it from Korea.

879
00:38:59,310 --> 00:39:00,743
What was that?

880
00:39:01,476 --> 00:39:03,243
- I brought kimchi. / - Really?

881
00:39:03,576 --> 00:39:05,076
You're the best.

882
00:39:05,076 --> 00:39:06,110
No joke.

883
00:39:07,476 --> 00:39:10,843
We can't go on a trip without this.

884
00:39:10,843 --> 00:39:13,476
We can't be happy without it.

885
00:39:13,476 --> 00:39:15,643
It's kimchi in a can.

886
00:39:15,643 --> 00:39:16,810
I'll grab one.

887
00:39:17,343 --> 00:39:18,976
This is kimchi.

888
00:39:21,643 --> 00:39:23,876
(Packed with food)

889
00:39:23,876 --> 00:39:25,743
Are you going on a camp?

890
00:39:27,010 --> 00:39:28,310
Is it stir-fried kimchi?

891
00:39:28,310 --> 00:39:32,210
- You asked for permission, right? / - Yes.

892
00:39:33,210 --> 00:39:34,610
Koreans need their kimchi.

893
00:39:38,343 --> 00:39:40,710
- This is amazing. / - It was really good.

894
00:39:40,710 --> 00:39:41,743
It's game over with kimchi.

895
00:39:41,743 --> 00:39:44,776
- It was amazing. / - Fried rice with kimchi is the best.

896
00:39:48,676 --> 00:39:52,043
Now it feels complete.

897
00:39:52,176 --> 00:39:53,176
Yeah.

898
00:39:59,776 --> 00:40:06,210
(It's not fancy but it's filling)

899
00:40:09,376 --> 00:40:10,510
I'm so full.

900
00:40:10,510 --> 00:40:11,710
- I really enjoyed it. / - You ate it all?

901
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:13,943
- You ate almost everything. / - We ate so well.

902
00:40:14,743 --> 00:40:16,310
What's wrong, captain?

903
00:40:16,310 --> 00:40:17,443
I like this watch.

904
00:40:17,443 --> 00:40:19,576
- It's cute. / - We need to go see the parade.

905
00:40:19,576 --> 00:40:20,676
What time does it start?

906
00:40:20,676 --> 00:40:21,610
- The parade? / - Yeah.

907
00:40:21,610 --> 00:40:23,143
Now.

908
00:40:23,143 --> 00:40:24,443
- Right now. / - Aren't we late?

909
00:40:24,443 --> 00:40:26,043
Wake them up. Wake up, guys.

910
00:40:26,043 --> 00:40:27,776
- Wake up. / - Wake up.

911
00:40:27,776 --> 00:40:30,043
We enjoyed dinner.

912
00:40:30,043 --> 00:40:32,843
Don't embarrass me tonight.

913
00:40:32,843 --> 00:40:34,743
Don't attract people's attention.

914
00:40:34,743 --> 00:40:36,543
I'm so embarrassed.

915
00:40:36,543 --> 00:40:37,810
- Let's go. / - Okay.

916
00:40:38,776 --> 00:40:39,943
It was really good.

917
00:40:40,776 --> 00:40:42,210
You two are like some...

918
00:40:43,343 --> 00:40:44,676
You're like a comedy duo.

919
00:40:44,676 --> 00:40:47,943
Watching them feels like watching comedian juniors.

920
00:40:48,943 --> 00:40:51,243
(Night has fallen over Disneyland)

921
00:40:51,243 --> 00:40:53,710
- This is the thing you must watch? / - Yes.

922
00:40:53,710 --> 00:40:55,910
Everyone returns to their childhood.

923
00:40:55,910 --> 00:40:56,743
Wow.

924
00:40:57,576 --> 00:41:01,643
(Everyone has been waiting for this moment)

925
00:41:01,643 --> 00:41:02,610
Wow.

926
00:41:03,443 --> 00:41:06,043
- All the characters must appear. / - Yeah, wow.

927
00:41:08,710 --> 00:41:15,210
(Night parade)

928
00:41:19,010 --> 00:41:22,843
Isn't that the Monsters, Inc. Right?

929
00:41:23,576 --> 00:41:24,876
He's DJ-ing.

930
00:41:25,710 --> 00:41:27,443
He was DJ-ing.

931
00:41:27,443 --> 00:41:29,043
It was so cute.

932
00:41:32,510 --> 00:41:33,543
So cute.

933
00:41:34,576 --> 00:41:35,610
(Scream!)

934
00:41:36,543 --> 00:41:41,276
(So much excitement)

935
00:41:43,276 --> 00:41:44,976
Like this.

936
00:41:45,243 --> 00:41:47,143
- Look at that. / - The Little Mermaid!

937
00:41:48,410 --> 00:41:50,010
The Little Mermaid.

938
00:41:50,010 --> 00:41:52,943
- She looks so splendid. / - She was so pretty.

939
00:41:53,210 --> 00:41:55,010
Hello!

940
00:41:57,176 --> 00:41:58,410
Hello.

941
00:41:58,410 --> 00:41:59,976
Under the sea!

942
00:41:59,976 --> 00:42:01,343
♪ Under the sea ♪

943
00:42:01,610 --> 00:42:03,276

Under the sea.

946
00:42:08,143 --> 00:42:09,610
It's Toy Story!

947
00:42:13,476 --> 00:42:15,543
- Hey! / - I watched the movie!

948
00:42:17,343 --> 00:42:23,010
(Men and women of all ages enjoy the parade)

949
00:42:23,010 --> 00:42:25,576
- It must be entrancing. / - Really.

950
00:42:27,643 --> 00:42:29,943
- You're so pretty! / - Pretty!

951
00:42:29,943 --> 00:42:31,210
Pretty!

00:42:32,410 --> 00:42:35,510
- Minnie will be here soon. / - Wait.

953
00:42:35,510 --> 00:42:36,810
Let's get ready.

954
00:42:36,810 --> 00:42:39,543
Mickey and Minnie are the main characters.

955
00:42:39,543 --> 00:42:41,676
- Let's get ready. / - Let's get ready.

956
00:42:41,676 --> 00:42:42,943
- Here they come. / - We can't lose.

957
00:42:42,943 --> 00:42:44,576
Our rivals. Mickey.

958
00:42:45,743 --> 00:42:47,710
- You have to get this on video. / - I love you.

959
00:42:47,710 --> 00:42:49,676
I love you! Yes!

960
00:42:49,976 --> 00:42:52,743
- She looked at us. / - She saw this.

961
00:42:52,743 --> 00:42:54,176
They can't miss you.

962
00:42:54,743 --> 00:42:56,276
Both of you are so loud.

963
00:42:58,043 --> 00:42:59,443
Mickey!

964
00:43:00,376 --> 00:43:01,476
Here!

965
00:43:02,310 --> 00:43:04,010
Mickey!

966
00:43:09,310 --> 00:43:11,343
Gosh. My throat.

967
00:43:11,776 --> 00:43:14,710
- Minnie looked at us. / - Yes.

968
00:43:14,710 --> 00:43:16,810
- She said we were cute. / - That's right.

969
00:43:16,810 --> 00:43:19,176
- We were successful. / - We're successful fans.

970
00:43:19,176 --> 00:43:20,743
We're successful fans.

971
00:43:20,743 --> 00:43:22,410
We're a success.

972
00:43:22,410 --> 00:43:23,543
- Nice. / - We succeeded.

973
00:43:23,543 --> 00:43:26,376
- Was that the last thing today? / - Time for bed now.

974
00:43:26,376 --> 00:43:28,743
- Okay. / - We did it.

975
00:43:28,743 --> 00:43:29,843
- Let's go. / - Yong Kong.

976
00:43:29,843 --> 00:43:32,910
Byul Kong. Hong Kong!

977
00:43:32,910 --> 00:43:34,743
Kong, kong, kong.

978
00:43:34,743 --> 00:43:36,476
Battle Trip!

979
00:43:38,110 --> 00:43:42,710
(It was a wonderful first day in Hong Kong)

980
00:43:43,810 --> 00:43:46,176
- They visited Disneyland. / - That was good.

981
00:43:46,176 --> 00:43:48,176
First of all, the train

982
00:43:48,176 --> 00:43:50,376
makes you get excited from the start.

983
00:43:50,376 --> 00:43:52,010
- The train itself. / - Right.

984
00:43:52,010 --> 00:43:52,910
That was great.

985
00:43:52,910 --> 00:43:55,443
It was very close and had a lot of benefits.

986
00:43:55,443 --> 00:43:57,076
You're tired at the end of the day

987
00:43:57,076 --> 00:43:59,343
and the resort is right there.

988
00:43:59,343 --> 00:44:00,343
So you can just go and sleep.

989
00:44:00,343 --> 00:44:01,676
- It was so convenient. / - Such a great course.

990
00:44:01,676 --> 00:44:04,043
- It was so great. / - Without moving around too much.

991
00:44:04,043 --> 00:44:06,143
As I watched your day...

992
00:44:06,143 --> 00:44:07,676
I was wondering when to go.

993
00:44:07,676 --> 00:44:09,276
- When would be the best weather? / - Really?

994
00:44:09,276 --> 00:44:10,910
- I worried about those things. / - For your kids?

995
00:44:10,910 --> 00:44:12,843
Yes, because when I went to Tokyo,

996
00:44:12,843 --> 00:44:14,510
I was there for 3 days and 2 nights.

997
00:44:14,510 --> 00:44:16,010
And that wasn't enough to see everything.

998
00:44:16,010 --> 00:44:17,610
- You couldn't, right? / - Because...

999
00:44:17,610 --> 00:44:20,276
You have to wait an hour to get on a ride.

1000
00:44:20,276 --> 00:44:21,810
That's standard.

1001
00:44:21,810 --> 00:44:24,143
But had I known,

1002
00:44:24,143 --> 00:44:26,443
I would've stayed at the hotel in the park.

1003
00:44:26,443 --> 00:44:27,810
If I'd known about the fast pass.

1004
00:44:27,810 --> 00:44:29,143
But I didn't know.

1005
00:44:29,143 --> 00:44:31,910
When I go there next time, I'll stay in that hotel.

1006
00:44:31,910 --> 00:44:33,910
- Because of the benefits. / - Why will you go there?

1007
00:44:33,910 --> 00:44:35,143
- What? / - Why?

1008
00:44:35,143 --> 00:44:38,010
I feel like I should at least once in my lifetime.

1009
00:44:38,010 --> 00:44:39,676
Would you like to come with us?

1010
00:44:39,676 --> 00:44:41,176
- With my family. / - What? No. I'll go by myself.

1011
00:44:42,110 --> 00:44:45,110
For the first half, we watched the Disneyland.

1012
00:44:45,110 --> 00:44:47,176
I wonder where they went in the latter half.

1013
00:44:47,176 --> 00:44:48,376
I'm looking forward to it.

1014
00:44:48,376 --> 00:44:50,976
- Moon Byul, what comes next? / - In the first half...

1015
00:44:50,976 --> 00:44:54,176
You saw a lot of flashy things in Disneyland.

1016
00:44:54,176 --> 00:44:55,043
Yes, the fancy side.

1017
00:44:55,043 --> 00:44:58,176
Now you'll get to see the lungs of Hong Kong.

1018
00:44:58,176 --> 00:44:58,610
Ah.

1019
00:44:58,610 --> 00:45:02,043
You'll get to see the beauty...

1020
00:45:02,043 --> 00:45:03,510
- Of Lantau Island. / - Sounds good.

1021
00:45:03,510 --> 00:45:06,176
Let's check out the latter half of the trip.

1022
00:45:06,176 --> 00:45:07,776
Here's the latter half.

1023
00:45:13,443 --> 00:45:16,143
(The morning is announced by... A beast?)

1024
00:45:18,243 --> 00:45:20,243
(This is MAMAMOO's charismatic rapper)

1025
00:45:20,243 --> 00:45:21,443
(Moon-star's charming in the morning)

1026
00:45:21,876 --> 00:45:22,543
Who is that?

1027
00:45:24,610 --> 00:45:26,376
She'll transform soon.

1028
00:45:28,510 --> 00:45:30,543
(Her mission is to wake up Solar)

1029
00:45:31,443 --> 00:45:32,910
Yongseon.

1030
00:45:34,810 --> 00:45:37,210
It's time to get up.

1031
00:45:40,510 --> 00:45:43,010
(Solar is up)

1032
00:45:48,976 --> 00:45:50,076
It's cold.

1033
00:45:51,443 --> 00:45:53,243
I'll close the door.

1034
00:45:56,943 --> 00:45:59,410
Joking around as soon as you wake up.

1035
00:46:00,676 --> 00:46:03,743
Say, "Please open the door."

1036
00:46:03,743 --> 00:46:05,310
(Please open the door)

1037
00:46:06,243 --> 00:46:08,143
Where are we going today?

1038
00:46:08,143 --> 00:46:09,776
Somewhere new.

1039
00:46:10,376 --> 00:46:13,310
What was that? You're yawning like you're bored.

1040
00:46:13,310 --> 00:46:15,576
It's just too early.

1041
00:46:16,076 --> 00:46:18,743
Don't jump for joy because you're too excited.

1042
00:46:18,743 --> 00:46:20,976
How joyful. They used up all their energy...

1043
00:46:20,976 --> 00:46:22,376
- Had a good sleep. / - Right.

1044
00:46:22,376 --> 00:46:23,376
Then wake up and expend energy again.

1045
00:46:23,376 --> 00:46:25,843
- Start the day energetically. / - That's Solar.

1046
00:46:27,210 --> 00:46:29,776
It's a breakfast buffet.

1047
00:46:30,643 --> 00:46:32,410
- Does it include breakfast? / - Yes.

1048
00:46:33,143 --> 00:46:35,710
- There was so much to eat. / - There was.

1049
00:46:38,210 --> 00:46:39,376
I love this.

1050
00:46:39,376 --> 00:46:41,343
(They put a lot on their plates)

1051
00:46:41,343 --> 00:46:42,943
There's so much variety.

1052
00:46:43,976 --> 00:46:46,976
Everything is Mickey Mouse here.

1053
00:46:46,976 --> 00:46:48,043
You're right.

1054
00:46:51,443 --> 00:46:53,676
Let's eat his ear first.

1055
00:46:53,810 --> 00:46:55,576
(Chomp)

1056
00:46:56,443 --> 00:46:58,243
His ear is missing.

1057
00:46:58,243 --> 00:46:59,243
You're cruel.

1058
00:46:59,876 --> 00:47:03,210
He looks unbalanced. Shall I eat the other one too?

1059
00:47:04,676 --> 00:47:07,243
(You're such a cruel person)

1060
00:47:08,110 --> 00:47:11,810
(They don't stop eating)

1061
00:47:15,576 --> 00:47:17,376
Breakfast is delicious.

1062
00:47:17,843 --> 00:47:21,410
I hear Mickey Mouse walks around in here.

1063
00:47:21,410 --> 00:47:22,510
He's over there now.

1064
00:47:24,176 --> 00:47:25,610
He's super popular.

1065
00:47:25,610 --> 00:47:27,710
- They're dressed up today. / - Yes.

1066
00:47:28,510 --> 00:47:29,943
Will they come here?

1067
00:47:29,943 --> 00:47:31,810
I don't think so.

1068
00:47:31,810 --> 00:47:33,110
Shall I call them over?

1069
00:47:34,376 --> 00:47:37,210
Mickey Mouse and Minnie Mouse

1070
00:47:37,210 --> 00:47:38,776
take pictures with you.

1071
00:47:40,476 --> 00:47:41,743
Hi.

1072
00:47:45,176 --> 00:47:46,343
Okay. Let's go.

1073
00:47:48,576 --> 00:47:49,610
Let's do hip hop.

1074
00:47:51,410 --> 00:47:53,510
- We lined up to take a picture. / - We did.

1075
00:47:53,510 --> 00:47:54,910
- Did you? / - After you had breakfast?

1076
00:47:54,910 --> 00:47:56,043
- Yes. / - After breakfast.

1077
00:47:56,576 --> 00:47:59,810
The line was short because it was in the morning.

1080
00:48:03,876 --> 00:48:05,610
(Moon Byul kisses Minnie on the nose)

1081
00:48:08,243 --> 00:48:10,943
- He's a boy. / - It felt weird.

1082
00:48:11,676 --> 00:48:14,176

1083
00:48:14,176 --> 00:48:15,510

1084

1086
00:48:21,276 --> 00:48:24,910

His leg.

1088
00:48:29,743 --> 00:48:31,043
So cute.

1089
00:48:33,243 --> 00:48:35,810
(See you next time!)

1090
00:48:37,343 --> 00:48:38,710
That's nice.

1091
00:48:40,310 --> 00:48:41,443
(Spectacular)

1092
00:48:41,443 --> 00:48:42,643
(New Hong Kong)

1093
00:48:42,843 --> 00:48:44,543
Are you ready?

1094
00:48:44,543 --> 00:48:45,876
It's a part of Hong Kong that

1095
00:48:45,876 --> 00:48:46,976
doesn't seem like Hong Kong.

1096
00:48:47,910 --> 00:48:48,676
What's that?

1097
00:48:48,676 --> 00:48:50,543
This is the start.

1098
00:48:51,376 --> 00:48:52,910
This isn't the Hong Kong I know.

1099
00:48:53,210 --> 00:48:55,676
There's so much nature.

1100
00:48:55,676 --> 00:48:56,910
- Yong Kong. / - Byul Kong.

1101
00:48:56,910 --> 00:48:58,876
Hong Kong!

1102
00:48:58,876 --> 00:49:00,476
That's nice.

1103
00:49:02,976 --> 00:49:04,710
(Day 2 in Lantau Island)

1104
00:49:04,710 --> 00:49:08,010
(Ngong Ping Village)

1105
00:49:08,010 --> 00:49:11,043
(40 minutes to Tung Chung Station from Disneyland)

1106
00:49:12,976 --> 00:49:13,976
Okay.

1107
00:49:14,043 --> 00:49:15,776
- Yong Kong. / - Byul Kong.

1108
00:49:15,776 --> 00:49:17,376
- Yong Kong. / - Moon and...

1109
00:49:17,376 --> 00:49:18,376
Sunlight.

1110
00:49:18,376 --> 00:49:19,510
- Yong Kong. / - Byul Kong.

1111
00:49:19,510 --> 00:49:20,910
Hong Kong.

1112
00:49:21,443 --> 00:49:23,676
(They're super excited)

1113
00:49:23,943 --> 00:49:26,976
(Congratulations on your 2nd day in Hong Kong)

1114
00:49:28,043 --> 00:49:29,210
(Why are they doing that?)

1115
00:49:29,210 --> 00:49:31,243
Applause please.

1116
00:49:31,576 --> 00:49:33,476
I have lots of equipment for today.

1117
00:49:33,476 --> 00:49:35,510
- A lot... / - Can you hear me, Moon Byul?

1118
00:49:35,976 --> 00:49:40,710
(Flag, loudspeaker mic, guide book)

1119
00:49:40,710 --> 00:49:43,143
- Do you know where we are going? / - Where?

1120
00:49:43,143 --> 00:49:45,576
We are going to...

1121
00:49:46,010 --> 00:49:47,976
Ngong Ping Village!

1122
00:49:48,243 --> 00:49:50,710
After Disneyland, we'll go down.

1123
00:49:50,710 --> 00:49:54,710
And we'll find Ngong Ping Village down here.

1124
00:49:55,210 --> 00:49:56,876
There's Ngong Ping Village.

1125
00:49:56,876 --> 00:50:01,143
They transformed a region into a village.

1126
00:50:01,143 --> 00:50:03,443
They have an enormous

1127
00:50:03,443 --> 00:50:05,443
bronze Buddha statue there.

1128
00:50:05,443 --> 00:50:08,210
- Are we going to see that? / - It's on the way to...

1129
00:50:08,210 --> 00:50:09,743
Ngong Ping Village.

1130
00:50:09,743 --> 00:50:12,410
We have to ride a cable car there.

1131
00:50:12,410 --> 00:50:14,310
- You like cable cars, right? / - Yes, I do.

1132
00:50:16,910 --> 00:50:18,543
(Cable car)

1133
00:50:18,543 --> 00:50:19,643
Cable car.

1134
00:50:20,643 --> 00:50:22,510
- 30 minutes? / - It takes 30 minutes?

1135
00:50:22,510 --> 00:50:24,643
- It's a really long ride. / - It takes 30 minutes?

1136
00:50:26,810 --> 00:50:28,976
Gosh, it's one of top 10 cable cars in the world.

1137
00:50:28,976 --> 00:50:31,043
- 5.7km. / - It's the longest in Asia.

1138
00:50:32,543 --> 00:50:34,543
(A mini theme park at the end of the cable car)

1139
00:50:34,543 --> 00:50:36,443
- It's a big island. / - Wow, what's that?

1140
00:50:36,443 --> 00:50:38,410
That's the Tian Tan Buddha.

1141
00:50:38,410 --> 00:50:40,743
- Is it on top of a mountain? / - Yes.

1142
00:50:40,743 --> 00:50:42,876
How did they make that with bronze?

1143
00:50:42,876 --> 00:50:45,476
You need to get a ticket to ride the cable car.

1144
00:50:45,476 --> 00:50:46,276
Did you buy it?

1145
00:50:46,276 --> 00:50:48,876
Of course. If you buy it online,

1146
00:50:48,876 --> 00:50:53,343
you don't have to line up.

1147
00:50:53,343 --> 00:50:56,443
With this ticket, you can ride the cable car.

1148
00:50:56,443 --> 00:50:58,876
Also you get unlimited bus rides

1149
00:50:58,876 --> 00:50:59,943
and boat rides.

1150
00:50:59,943 --> 00:51:02,476
It's 5.7m long.

1151
00:51:04,410 --> 00:51:07,610
- You mean km. / - Right. I'm sorry.

1152
00:51:07,610 --> 00:51:10,410
It's 5.7km. I forgot the K.

1153
00:51:13,676 --> 00:51:15,410
That makes a huge difference.

1154
00:51:15,410 --> 00:51:18,310
There are two types. Standard and crystal.

1155
00:51:18,310 --> 00:51:21,043
- They're the cable cars. / - What's the difference?

1156
00:51:21,043 --> 00:51:22,810
Standard is just standard.

1157
00:51:22,810 --> 00:51:25,410
Crystal is luxurious.

1158
00:51:28,676 --> 00:51:31,943
So we chose the crystal cabin.

1159
00:51:31,943 --> 00:51:33,910
- I see. / - Because it's our only trip.

1160
00:51:33,910 --> 00:51:36,210
I prepared something special.

1161
00:51:36,210 --> 00:51:37,843
Let's go.

1162
00:51:37,843 --> 00:51:39,943
Yong Kong, Byul Kong, Hong Kong.

1163
00:51:45,610 --> 00:51:47,843
(Let's start the Solar tour)

1164
00:51:49,543 --> 00:51:53,110
We're going to skip this line.

1165
00:51:53,110 --> 00:51:55,676
This is nice. If you buy the ticket in Korea...

1166
00:51:55,676 --> 00:51:57,743
- You don't have to wait in line, right? / - That's right.

1167
00:51:58,776 --> 00:51:59,676
Let's go.

1168
00:52:00,676 --> 00:52:01,743
Hello.

1169
00:52:02,510 --> 00:52:03,610
Okay.

1170
00:52:03,610 --> 00:52:05,376
Oh, yeah. Come on.

1171
00:52:06,710 --> 00:52:09,543
(Luxurious crystal cable car)

1172
00:52:10,576 --> 00:52:12,076
Please sit down.

1173
00:52:12,076 --> 00:52:14,110
This is amazing.

1174
00:52:14,110 --> 00:52:15,043
Be careful.

1175
00:52:15,976 --> 00:52:19,210
Now for 5.7km...

1176
00:52:19,210 --> 00:52:23,810
Welcome to the crystal cable car.

1177
00:52:23,810 --> 00:52:26,476
- It's like a ride. / - Yong Kong, Byul Kong, Hong Kong.

1178
00:52:26,476 --> 00:52:28,576
Welcome, everyone.

1179
00:52:28,576 --> 00:52:30,910
You would make a great tour guide.

1180
00:52:30,910 --> 00:52:32,310
It was so much fun.

1181
00:52:33,143 --> 00:52:34,910
The door has closed.

1182
00:52:34,910 --> 00:52:36,576
It means we're going to leave.

1183
00:52:36,576 --> 00:52:37,943
Let's go.

1184
00:52:38,810 --> 00:52:40,243
- It's fast. / - Wow.

1185
00:52:46,343 --> 00:52:47,776
Wow, check out the floor.

1186
00:52:49,676 --> 00:52:50,876
Oh, my.

1187
00:52:50,876 --> 00:52:52,676
- Wow. / - I got goose bumps.

1188
00:52:52,676 --> 00:52:54,743
The guide is scared so she's not saying anything.

1189
00:52:54,743 --> 00:52:56,310
Why won't you look at the floor?

1190
00:52:56,310 --> 00:52:57,376
It was scary.

1191
00:52:59,076 --> 00:53:01,776
The floor is awesome.

1192
00:53:01,776 --> 00:53:03,510
The ocean is emerald color.

1193
00:53:03,510 --> 00:53:04,610
Let's take a picture.

1194
00:53:04,610 --> 00:53:06,076
Can you sit down?

1195
00:53:06,076 --> 00:53:06,943
- Here? / - Yes.

1196
00:53:06,943 --> 00:53:08,310
Why don't you sit first?

1197
00:53:08,476 --> 00:53:10,410
Me? I can do it.

1198
00:53:10,410 --> 00:53:11,210
Wow...

1199
00:53:12,210 --> 00:53:13,243
Wow...

1200
00:53:14,010 --> 00:53:15,443
It feels so close.

1201
00:53:16,810 --> 00:53:18,376
- From here... / - This is amazing.

1202
00:53:18,810 --> 00:53:20,910
- Wait... / - The angle...

1203
00:53:20,910 --> 00:53:22,410
(Taking pictures on the cable car floor)

1204
00:53:24,443 --> 00:53:25,443
Wow.

1205
00:53:25,443 --> 00:53:26,776
It looks like you're floating on air.

1206
00:53:26,776 --> 00:53:29,143
We can't capture...

1207
00:53:29,543 --> 00:53:31,576
Everything properly in the photo.

1208
00:53:31,576 --> 00:53:33,576
- It's... / - You're really bad at taking photos.

1209
00:53:33,576 --> 00:53:35,710
- How could you take it like that? / - Yes.

1210
00:53:35,710 --> 00:53:37,410
- Your torso looks huge. / - I know.

1211
00:53:38,910 --> 00:53:40,910
It's like I'm sitting on the ocean.

1212
00:53:40,910 --> 00:53:42,910
- Come forward. / - That's right.

1213
00:53:43,443 --> 00:53:44,443
It looks like computer graphics.

1214
00:53:44,443 --> 00:53:45,776
Should I sit like this?

1215
00:53:45,776 --> 00:53:47,410
Think of it as a core workout.

1216
00:53:47,410 --> 00:53:49,476
2, 3.

1217
00:53:49,476 --> 00:53:50,843
How did the photo turn out?

1218
00:53:51,676 --> 00:53:53,910
You can see a lot of the ocean.

1219
00:53:55,476 --> 00:53:57,310
- It looks like you're floating. / - Oh, oh.

1220
00:53:58,243 --> 00:54:00,810
Good photo, right? This is how you take photos.

1221
00:54:00,810 --> 00:54:02,610
Aren't the photos similar?

1222
00:54:03,376 --> 00:54:05,276
You have to lie down and take a selfie there.

1223
00:54:05,276 --> 00:54:08,443
The floor and the sides are

1224
00:54:08,443 --> 00:54:09,976
all made of glass.

1225
00:54:10,676 --> 00:54:14,876
It helps you enjoy the natural landscape.

1226
00:54:14,876 --> 00:54:15,943
(Today's destination)

1227
00:54:17,610 --> 00:54:20,376
- This is the Ngong Ping Village. / - We're here.

1228
00:54:20,843 --> 00:54:22,643

1229
00:54:22,643 --> 00:54:24,476
- Why? / - I need to plug the mic in.

1230
00:54:26,376 --> 00:54:27,876
Let me test the mic.

1231
00:54:27,876 --> 00:54:29,043
Okay, it's working.

1232
00:54:29,910 --> 00:54:33,043
If you look to your right...

1233
00:54:33,043 --> 00:54:34,276
That's so big.

1234
00:54:34,543 --> 00:54:37,510
Can you see that? It's a giant Buddha statue.

1235
00:54:37,510 --> 00:54:38,843
That's where we're going.

1236
00:54:38,843 --> 00:54:40,510
Are you going to walk there?

1237
00:54:40,510 --> 00:54:42,043
Yes, it's close.

1238
00:54:42,343 --> 00:54:43,143
(Ngong Ping Village)

1239

1241

(It's connected to Ngong Ping cable car's last stop)

1242
00:54:49,776 --> 00:54:52,276
- There's also a tour guide here. / - Yes.

1243
00:54:54,276 --> 00:54:55,210
Hi.

1244
00:54:56,276 --> 00:54:58,076

He's walking over there.

1248
00:55:09,276 --> 00:55:10,343
- What is that? / - What is that?

1249
00:55:10,343 --> 00:55:12,476
Cows wander around here.

1250
00:55:12,476 --> 00:55:13,643
Really?

1251
00:55:13,643 --> 00:55:14,743
(You can see animals roaming freely)

1252
00:55:14,743 --> 00:55:17,043
We've arrived at the Tian Tan Buddha.

1253
00:55:17,043 --> 00:55:18,443
Drum roll.

1254
00:55:18,443 --> 00:55:20,476
We've arrived at the Tian Tan Buddha.

1255
00:55:20,943 --> 00:55:23,410
It's the biggest bronze statue of Buddha in the world.

1256
00:55:23,410 --> 00:55:24,810
It's so much higher.

1257
00:55:26,310 --> 00:55:28,043
There's a lot to see.

1258
00:55:28,443 --> 00:55:29,610
This is nice.

1259
00:55:29,610 --> 00:55:30,776
It weighs 202 tons.

1260
00:55:30,776 --> 00:55:32,843
- It was really big. / - It was really big.

1261
00:55:32,843 --> 00:55:34,210
Let me explain.

1262
00:55:34,210 --> 00:55:36,443
They call this place the Tian Tan.

1263
00:55:36,443 --> 00:55:39,310
If you stand in the middle and talk,

1264
00:55:39,310 --> 00:55:40,910
it will echo.

1265
00:55:43,110 --> 00:55:44,610
- Why? / - It echoes. Do you hear it?

1266
00:55:44,610 --> 00:55:46,343
I don't know. I didn't hear it.

1267
00:55:46,343 --> 00:55:47,943
It's echoing.

1268
00:55:53,443 --> 00:55:54,043
Wait a minute.

1269
00:55:54,043 --> 00:55:56,610
- It doesn't echo from here. / - Can you hear it?

1270
00:55:56,610 --> 00:55:57,476
- Yes. / - It's echoing.

1271
00:55:57,843 --> 00:55:59,376
I can hear echoes.

1272
00:55:59,510 --> 00:56:01,243
- This is awesome. / - Isn't it because of the mic?

1273
00:56:03,243 --> 00:56:04,710
I can hear echoes.

1274
00:56:04,710 --> 00:56:06,176
This is so awesome.

1275
00:56:07,243 --> 00:56:09,143
- Try it here. / - You need to do it here.

1276
00:56:09,143 --> 00:56:10,443
Ah. You need to do it here.

1277
00:56:10,443 --> 00:56:12,910
It only echoes in the very middle.

1278
00:56:13,876 --> 00:56:15,510
This sound is from the mic.

1279
00:56:17,843 --> 00:56:20,176
You should turn the mic off first.

1280
00:56:20,576 --> 00:56:22,976
It feels like this.

1281
00:56:22,976 --> 00:56:24,710
- Yes, to explain it. / - I'm trying to explain it.

1282
00:56:24,710 --> 00:56:26,510
Over here it's normal. But here...

1283
00:56:27,243 --> 00:56:29,110
Ah. It really echoes!

1284
00:56:29,310 --> 00:56:30,776
It's really interesting.

1285
00:56:30,776 --> 00:56:31,843
Let me explain.

1286
00:56:31,843 --> 00:56:33,743
There are 268 stairs.

1287
00:56:33,743 --> 00:56:37,110
In Cantonese, 2 means "easy."

1288
00:56:37,110 --> 00:56:39,376
6 means "continues."

1289
00:56:39,376 --> 00:56:41,676
And 8 means "wealth."

1290
00:56:41,676 --> 00:56:44,576
So it means you'll get good fortune here.

1291
00:56:45,443 --> 00:56:47,676
- Do you want to run the stairs? / - No...

1292
00:56:47,676 --> 00:56:49,510
I don't want to waste my energy like that.

1293
00:56:50,176 --> 00:56:51,976
- Get ready. / - Ready.

1294
00:56:51,976 --> 00:56:53,343
How long will they be able to run?

1295
00:56:53,343 --> 00:56:55,710
She was so confident that we'd run to the top.

1296
00:56:55,710 --> 00:56:57,143
Wouldn't they get tired halfway?

1297
00:56:57,710 --> 00:56:58,943
Ready.

1298
00:56:59,843 --> 00:57:01,376
Set. Go.

1299
00:57:04,576 --> 00:57:05,810
You can't do two steps at a time.

1300
00:57:05,810 --> 00:57:07,376
One step at a time.

1301
00:57:07,376 --> 00:57:09,176
Why are you doing two steps at a time?

1302
00:57:09,576 --> 00:57:11,076
(Her desperate hand is flailing)

1303
00:57:11,076 --> 00:57:13,210
You can tell who's older.

1304
00:57:14,210 --> 00:57:15,276
I can tell from this.

1305
00:57:17,610 --> 00:57:20,543
- Is she already tired? / - She wanted to make a bet.

1306
00:57:20,543 --> 00:57:21,343
What are you doing?

1307
00:57:22,110 --> 00:57:23,810
Moon Byul really climbed up high.

1308
00:57:24,543 --> 00:57:25,510
I'm done.

1309
00:57:25,510 --> 00:57:28,810
- Yongseon. / - Moon Byul's stamina is amazing.

1310
00:57:30,743 --> 00:57:32,843
What's that?

1311
00:57:32,843 --> 00:57:34,110
You're the guide.

1312
00:57:36,910 --> 00:57:39,243
Solar, you wanted to do it first.

1313
00:57:39,243 --> 00:57:41,110
This is the first time seeing her frown.

1314
00:57:41,110 --> 00:57:42,710
She was always so bright.

1315
00:57:44,476 --> 00:57:46,043
This is amazing.

1316
00:57:46,043 --> 00:57:46,910
It's really big.

1317
00:57:46,910 --> 00:57:49,010
- So big. / - Super awesome.

1318
00:57:50,310 --> 00:57:53,810
(It's more magnificent from up close)

1319
00:57:55,876 --> 00:58:01,010
When you see nature like this...

1320
00:58:01,010 --> 00:58:03,610
It's magnificent but sometimes scary.

1321
00:58:03,610 --> 00:58:04,376
Why?

1322
00:58:05,143 --> 00:58:07,076
Because nature is so grand.

1323
00:58:07,676 --> 00:58:09,543
I think that's why it's sometimes scary.

1324
00:58:12,810 --> 00:58:14,143
(Day 2 of Lantau Island)

1325
00:58:14,143 --> 00:58:15,810
(Enjoy Hong Kong local cuisine)

1326
00:58:15,810 --> 00:58:17,176
Hong Kong local cuisine.

1327
00:58:17,176 --> 00:58:19,710
- We're going to another place. / - Where?

1328
00:58:19,710 --> 00:58:21,076
Where are we going?

1329
00:58:21,076 --> 00:58:22,410
Can you see that?

1330
00:58:22,410 --> 00:58:24,376
We're going to Tai O Village.

1331
00:58:24,376 --> 00:58:25,643
To another village?

1332
00:58:26,143 --> 00:58:28,376
- Okay, let's go. / - Let's go.

1333
00:58:29,243 --> 00:58:31,943
If you buy the 360 pass,

1334
00:58:31,943 --> 00:58:34,676
you can take this bus for free.

1335
00:58:34,676 --> 00:58:37,543
You have to buy the 360 pass.

1336
00:58:37,543 --> 00:58:38,843
It's really convenient.

1337
00:58:38,843 --> 00:58:41,710
(20 minutes from Ngong Ping Village to Tai O Village)

1338
00:58:42,943 --> 00:58:44,543
We're here.

1339
00:58:44,543 --> 00:58:46,376
- What is this place? / - We have arrived.

1340
00:58:46,376 --> 00:58:48,743
- Where is this place? / - This place is...

1341
00:58:49,110 --> 00:58:50,310
A village of floating houses.

1342
00:58:50,310 --> 00:58:52,210
We're here at Tai O Village.

1343
00:58:52,210 --> 00:58:53,976
Is that mic working?

1344
00:58:53,976 --> 00:58:55,943
It's run out of battery.

1345
00:58:55,943 --> 00:58:57,176
♪ My battery died ♪

1346
00:58:57,710 --> 00:58:59,310
♪ So I missed your call ♪

1347
00:58:59,310 --> 00:59:01,443
That's Unnies.

1348
00:59:01,443 --> 00:59:03,543
I love that song.

1349
00:59:04,843 --> 00:59:06,810
You carry around so much...

1350
00:59:06,810 --> 00:59:07,843
What's that?

1351
00:59:08,176 --> 00:59:09,976
(So bubbly)

1352
00:59:10,476 --> 00:59:11,843
She's bright again.

1353
00:59:12,743 --> 00:59:15,876
I brought another mic just in case.

1354
00:59:15,876 --> 00:59:18,443
- You're awesome. / - I am, right?

1355
00:59:18,443 --> 00:59:21,476
This place doesn't seem like Hong Kong.

1356
00:59:21,476 --> 00:59:23,043
It's Hong Kong but doesn't seem like Hong Kong?

1357
00:59:23,043 --> 00:59:25,110
- It's totally... / - Here, it's...

1358
00:59:25,110 --> 00:59:26,776
This isn't the Hong Kong I know.

1359
00:59:26,776 --> 00:59:29,343
It feels like we're in a different country.

1360
00:59:29,343 --> 00:59:31,810
It doesn't feel like Hong Kong.

1361
00:59:32,410 --> 00:59:33,710
Floating houses.

1362
00:59:33,710 --> 00:59:37,110
These are the last floating houses in Hong Kong.

1363
00:59:37,110 --> 00:59:38,610
They're being redeveloped.

1364
00:59:38,610 --> 00:59:40,710
These houses were supposed to go.

1365
00:59:40,710 --> 00:59:43,876
So the tourists flocked here.

1366
00:59:43,876 --> 00:59:46,943
People decided to preserve the floating houses then.

1367
00:59:46,943 --> 00:59:50,043
That's why it remains in here.

1368
00:59:50,043 --> 00:59:51,276
- That's great. / - Yeah.

1369
00:59:51,876 --> 00:59:53,610
(There's dried fisheries market in the village)

1370
00:59:53,610 --> 00:59:56,710
- There are floating houses here. / - Yes.

1371
00:59:56,710 --> 00:59:59,876
So a lot of dried fisheries are sold here.

1372
00:59:59,876 --> 01:00:01,476
There are a lot of interesting things here.

1373
01:00:01,476 --> 01:00:02,610
What are these?

1374
01:00:02,610 --> 01:00:04,810
There were a lot of interesting dried fish there.

1375
01:00:04,810 --> 01:00:06,410
Aren't these mussels?

1376
01:00:06,410 --> 01:00:09,076
They sell everything dried here.

1377
01:00:11,143 --> 01:00:12,210
What did she see?

1378
01:00:12,210 --> 01:00:13,576
You're not supposed to touch that.

1379
01:00:14,043 --> 01:00:15,976
- I was just looking. / - Oh, my.

1380
01:00:18,276 --> 01:00:19,376
This is really big.

1381
01:00:24,576 --> 01:00:26,243
- Why? / - Look at this.

1382
01:00:26,243 --> 01:00:27,476
I was so surprised.

1383
01:00:27,476 --> 01:00:28,476
What is this?

1384
01:00:30,010 --> 01:00:32,610
I think it's a dried shark.

1385
01:00:32,610 --> 01:00:35,043
- Wow. / - They dried a whole shark.

1386
01:00:35,043 --> 01:00:36,110
Where do they use that?

1387
01:00:36,610 --> 01:00:38,910
This...

1388
01:00:38,910 --> 01:00:40,143
It's awesome.

1389
01:00:40,143 --> 01:00:43,443
We didn't eat anything at Ngong Ping.

1390
01:00:43,443 --> 01:00:45,243
I'm hungry from this smell.

1391
01:00:45,243 --> 01:00:46,876
Oh, my. Is this a squid?

1392
01:00:46,876 --> 01:00:48,443
It's a really big squid.

1393
01:00:48,443 --> 01:00:50,176
- My goodness. / - It's really big.

1394
01:00:50,976 --> 01:00:53,176
- It looks good. / - It's really good.

1395
01:00:53,176 --> 01:00:54,276
- Really? / - Is it boiled?

1396
01:00:54,276 --> 01:00:55,810
- Yes. / - It's boiled.

1397
01:00:58,643 --> 01:00:59,710
How is it?

1398
01:01:00,210 --> 01:01:01,410
It's heavy.

1399
01:01:01,410 --> 01:01:02,943
It looks really heavy.

1400
01:01:03,876 --> 01:01:05,310
The color looks like pork hocks.

1401
01:01:05,310 --> 01:01:08,476
- It's bigger than our faces. / - Is it seasoned?

1402
01:01:08,476 --> 01:01:10,243
- Yes, I think it's seasoned with soy sauce. / - Right?

1403
01:01:10,243 --> 01:01:12,643
- They preserved it in soy sauce. / - It looks so good.

1404
01:01:12,643 --> 01:01:14,476
That is really good. I've had it before.

1405
01:01:14,476 --> 01:01:15,776
It was really good.

1406
01:01:15,776 --> 01:01:18,510
- Everyone is waiting in line. / - Wait a minute.

1407
01:01:18,510 --> 01:01:20,243
- Are they all in line? / - This place is popular.

1408
01:01:20,243 --> 01:01:21,510
There wasn't a line when we first got there.

1409
01:01:21,510 --> 01:01:23,043
Suddenly, A line formed...

1410
01:01:23,043 --> 01:01:25,343
People suddenly started to gather.

1411
01:01:25,343 --> 01:01:27,676
- They're mostly tourists. / - Yes.

1412
01:01:28,643 --> 01:01:29,943
Thank you.

1413
01:01:29,943 --> 01:01:32,110
(Ready to eat after adding special soy sauce)

1414
01:01:37,110 --> 01:01:39,143
- That looks really delicious. / - It tastes like?

1415
01:01:39,143 --> 01:01:40,943
This is really delicious.

1416
01:01:41,743 --> 01:01:44,443
It's firm. Should I say it's robust?

1417
01:01:44,443 --> 01:01:45,676
The inside is...

1418
01:01:45,676 --> 01:01:47,243
- So chewy. / - That's right, it's chewy.

1419
01:01:48,310 --> 01:01:49,243
It's really good.

1420
01:01:49,243 --> 01:01:51,043
As you can see,

1421
01:01:51,043 --> 01:01:53,576
it looks very chewy, right?

1422
01:01:53,576 --> 01:01:55,176
It really is chewy.

1423
01:01:58,110 --> 01:02:00,843
We've never had such thick squid before.

1424
01:02:00,843 --> 01:02:02,110
- That's right. / - The texture must be...

1425
01:02:02,110 --> 01:02:03,210
- Really good. / - Yes, it's really good.

1426
01:02:03,210 --> 01:02:04,276
I'm curious.

1427
01:02:04,276 --> 01:02:05,243
It's delicious.

1428
01:02:05,476 --> 01:02:06,610
Let's try another place.

1429
01:02:11,110 --> 01:02:12,076
(Take care)

1430
01:02:12,076 --> 01:02:13,010
I want to try some.

1431
01:02:16,343 --> 01:02:17,643
- If you look there... / - Wow.

1432
01:02:17,643 --> 01:02:20,110
It's really floating on the water.

1433
01:02:20,443 --> 01:02:21,943
It really is a floating house.

1434
01:02:21,943 --> 01:02:25,043
The locals really live here.

1435
01:02:27,310 --> 01:02:28,576
It's really unique.

1436
01:02:28,576 --> 01:02:31,310
It's not something you see often.

1437
01:02:31,710 --> 01:02:32,676
Nice.

1438
01:02:33,076 --> 01:02:34,876
It's really nice.

1439
01:02:37,110 --> 01:02:38,110
- Moon Byul. / - Yes?

1440
01:02:38,910 --> 01:02:40,410
I'm scared when you call me.

1441
01:02:40,410 --> 01:02:43,310
- Knock, knock. / - Why are you tapping my shoulder?

1442
01:02:43,310 --> 01:02:44,676
- Is your stomach okay? / - Yes.

1443
01:02:44,676 --> 01:02:47,043
- Oh, like this? / - I heard it rumbling.

1444
01:02:47,043 --> 01:02:47,910
- Did you hear it? / - Yes.

1445
01:02:47,910 --> 01:02:49,176
- Follow me. / - Is it here?

1446
01:02:49,176 --> 01:02:51,476
Squid wouldn't be enough.

1447
01:02:51,476 --> 01:02:53,176
- It's here. / - We were hungry.

1448
01:02:53,176 --> 01:02:55,043
It already seems delicious.

1449
01:02:55,043 --> 01:02:56,276
- Can you already tell? / - Yes, it's going to be good.

1450
01:02:56,276 --> 01:02:57,543
- Is it a good place? / - Yes.

1451
01:02:57,543 --> 01:02:58,576
It's going to be a good place.

1452
01:03:00,310 --> 01:03:03,310
Sikyung can tell from the door.

1453
01:03:03,310 --> 01:03:04,210
It looks delicious.

1454
01:03:04,210 --> 01:03:06,810
(Fusion cheese seafood with steamed pumpkin)

1455
01:03:07,443 --> 01:03:10,643
(You can enjoy both local cuisine and fusion dishes)

1456
01:03:11,143 --> 01:03:13,510
This is a floating house.

1457
01:03:13,510 --> 01:03:16,576
A fisherman who lives here

1458
01:03:16,576 --> 01:03:18,643
is running this restaurant.

1459
01:03:18,643 --> 01:03:20,610
I like places like this.

1460
01:03:20,610 --> 01:03:22,376
The food is really fresh at places like these.

1461
01:03:22,743 --> 01:03:24,310
I reserved this place about a month ago.

1462
01:03:24,310 --> 01:03:25,443
- You did? / - Yes.

1463
01:03:25,610 --> 01:03:27,010
It was really hard.

1464
01:03:27,010 --> 01:03:29,110
Are you friends with this fisherman?

1465
01:03:29,110 --> 01:03:31,210
Yes, I got to know him well.

1466
01:03:31,210 --> 01:03:33,443
I call him uncle. Uncle.

1467
01:03:35,243 --> 01:03:37,643
- I went too far, right? / - Yeah.

1468
01:03:37,643 --> 01:03:41,143
I didn't know that we would really eat

1469
01:03:41,143 --> 01:03:42,376
on top of water.

1470
01:03:42,376 --> 01:03:43,243
Look at that.

1471
01:03:44,743 --> 01:03:47,276
It's amazing. We could never see that in cities.

1472
01:03:47,276 --> 01:03:50,010
- It's different from the Hong Kong I imagined. / - Right?

1473
01:03:50,010 --> 01:03:50,443
For me too.

1474
01:03:50,443 --> 01:03:52,543
It must feel very unique.

1475
01:03:52,543 --> 01:03:55,043
- It feels special. / - I think so too.

1476
01:03:55,043 --> 01:03:56,410
Thank you.

1477
01:03:56,410 --> 01:03:58,110
(The food came while they were enjoying the view)

1478
01:03:58,110 --> 01:03:59,476
This is what we ordered.

1479
01:03:59,476 --> 01:04:01,910
- It's rice steamed in lotus leaves. / - Say it faster.

1480
01:04:01,910 --> 01:04:03,110
Rice steamed in lotus leaves.

1481
01:04:03,943 --> 01:04:06,643
(Rice steamed in lotus leaves in a bamboo steamer)

1482
01:04:06,643 --> 01:04:09,576
Is that meat inside the rice?

1483
01:04:09,576 --> 01:04:12,043
This is meat, this is squid.

1484
01:04:12,043 --> 01:04:14,276
- Anchovies? / - Anchovies.

1485
01:04:15,143 --> 01:04:16,910
The lotus leaves are hidden here.

1486
01:04:17,810 --> 01:04:18,743
Okay.

1487
01:04:19,076 --> 01:04:20,610
I want to give you a bite of everything.

1488
01:04:21,810 --> 01:04:22,876
1, 2, 3.

1489
01:04:23,610 --> 01:04:25,210
(Oh, my)

1490
01:04:28,810 --> 01:04:29,810
What does it taste like?

1491
01:04:30,676 --> 01:04:31,876
(Hmm)

1492
01:04:31,876 --> 01:04:33,243
It tastes like seafood.

1493
01:04:34,343 --> 01:04:36,210
That's because there's seafood in it.

1494
01:04:41,876 --> 01:04:45,876
(Analyzing the taste)

1495
01:04:45,876 --> 01:04:50,676
It's like when your mom always makes you

1496
01:04:50,676 --> 01:04:51,876
kimchi fried rice at home,

1497
01:04:51,876 --> 01:04:54,210
then she feels like she should make something else.

1498
01:04:55,343 --> 01:04:59,210
So she put anchovies and other healthy ingredients

1499
01:04:59,210 --> 01:05:01,643
and fried them to make a delicious dish.

1500
01:05:01,643 --> 01:05:02,810
That's what it tastes like.

1501
01:05:02,810 --> 01:05:03,876
What are you talking about?

1502
01:05:04,610 --> 01:05:08,110
Try to explain the taste.

1503
01:05:08,110 --> 01:05:10,843
It just tastes like seafood.

1504
01:05:10,843 --> 01:05:12,076
It tastes like seafood

1505
01:05:12,076 --> 01:05:14,176
but...

1506
01:05:14,176 --> 01:05:17,176
It has a mild and basic flavor.

1507
01:05:17,176 --> 01:05:18,276
- Perfect? / - They all go well together.

1508
01:05:18,276 --> 01:05:19,810
- Is it perfect? / - Yes.

1509
01:05:19,810 --> 01:05:21,476
Oh, my.

1510
01:05:26,310 --> 01:05:28,310
- This looks delicious. / - It is.

1511
01:05:30,710 --> 01:05:35,110
There are a lot of fusion dishes for the tourists.

1512
01:05:36,276 --> 01:05:37,343
That looks delicious.

1513
01:05:37,343 --> 01:05:38,710
Look how plump the shrimp is.

1514
01:05:39,843 --> 01:05:40,676
Let's try it.

1515
01:05:40,676 --> 01:05:43,010
(The seafood is so big, it completely fills the mouth)

1516
01:05:43,910 --> 01:05:45,910
It's so hot.

1517
01:05:47,210 --> 01:05:47,976
It's hot.

1518
01:05:47,976 --> 01:05:50,376
The cheese, pumpkin,

1519
01:05:50,376 --> 01:05:51,676
and seafood.

1520
01:05:51,676 --> 01:05:54,943
The seafood is really good here.

1521
01:05:54,943 --> 01:05:58,210
And it's all really big. The shrimp is big.

1522
01:05:58,210 --> 01:06:00,176
They don't skimp on the ingredients, right?

1523
01:06:00,176 --> 01:06:01,510
The dishes were plentiful.

1524
01:06:01,510 --> 01:06:02,876
This is really good.

1525
01:06:02,876 --> 01:06:05,943
The cheese and seafood inside the pumpkin

1526
01:06:05,943 --> 01:06:08,876
makes it seem like a cream pasta.

1527
01:06:09,676 --> 01:06:11,076
It's a diet food.

1528
01:06:11,076 --> 01:06:12,343
- What? / - It's a diet food.

1529
01:06:12,343 --> 01:06:13,610
With all that cheese?

1530
01:06:13,610 --> 01:06:15,243
- It has pumpkin. / - Yes.

1531
01:06:15,510 --> 01:06:17,310
It'll relieve bloating so it's a diet food.

1532
01:06:23,910 --> 01:06:27,043
- It's like cream pasta sauce. / - You're right.

1533
01:06:27,043 --> 01:06:28,776
- It's thicker. / - Yes.

1534
01:06:28,776 --> 01:06:30,876
While eating this,

1535
01:06:30,876 --> 01:06:32,643
this is cheese

1536
01:06:32,643 --> 01:06:35,010
and I don't like greasy food...

1537
01:06:36,010 --> 01:06:37,543
- Will she want kimchi again? / - It can't be.

1538
01:06:38,376 --> 01:06:39,476
It can't be.

1539
01:06:40,110 --> 01:06:41,610
- Do you want it? / - Yeah.

1540
01:06:41,610 --> 01:06:43,310
Close your eyes then.

1541
01:06:43,310 --> 01:06:44,976
- Make a wish. / - What kind of wish?

1542
01:06:44,976 --> 01:06:47,543
- Say, "Please give me kimchi." / - Give me kimchi.

1543
01:06:47,543 --> 01:06:49,543
Please give me some kimchi.

1544
01:06:50,576 --> 01:06:52,043
They really know how to have a good time.

1545
01:06:53,343 --> 01:06:54,610
Ta-da.

1546
01:06:56,143 --> 01:06:58,576
Ta-da.

1547
01:06:58,576 --> 01:07:00,310
- Here. / - It's kimchi.

1548
01:07:00,310 --> 01:07:03,943
I remember eating this last time.

1549
01:07:06,510 --> 01:07:08,310
Does it melt in your mouth?

1550
01:07:08,310 --> 01:07:09,543
Eat up.

1551
01:07:10,510 --> 01:07:13,676
The restaurant thankfully allowed us to eat kimchi.

1552
01:07:13,676 --> 01:07:15,210
We could enjoy the food more.

1553
01:07:15,210 --> 01:07:17,443
- You're both in your 20s, right? / - Yes.

1554
01:07:18,476 --> 01:07:22,476
(Sunset cafe)

1555
01:07:22,476 --> 01:07:25,143
When the sun is about to set,

1556
01:07:25,143 --> 01:07:28,843
we're going to enjoy the sunset while relaxing.

1557
01:07:28,843 --> 01:07:30,810
You like that kind of thing?

1558
01:07:30,810 --> 01:07:32,910
- Relaxation. Healing. / - Rest.

1559
01:07:32,910 --> 01:07:34,010
- Healing. / - Right.

1560
01:07:34,010 --> 01:07:37,776
Relaxing while enjoying the sunset with friends.

1561
01:07:38,943 --> 01:07:42,676
(The sunset disappeared because of sudden rain)

1562
01:07:43,376 --> 01:07:44,976
- Did it rain? / - Yes.

1563
01:07:44,976 --> 01:07:46,976
It's even more beautiful with the rain.

1564
01:07:46,976 --> 01:07:48,543
- This is what it was supposed to be? / - Yes.

1565
01:07:49,510 --> 01:07:51,610
- You couldn't see this. / - You missed that?

1566
01:08:05,343 --> 01:08:07,943
This place has a unique vibe.

1567
01:08:07,943 --> 01:08:10,776
- Doesn't it feel cozy? / - Yeah.

1568
01:08:10,776 --> 01:08:13,576
This place is really cozy.

1569
01:08:16,676 --> 01:08:19,243
I heard that when it rains in Hong Kong...

1570
01:08:19,243 --> 01:08:23,476
- People like to drink hot honey lemon tea. / - This?

1571
01:08:23,476 --> 01:08:25,010
Yes, honey lemon tea.

1572
01:08:27,910 --> 01:08:29,076
Thank you.

1573
01:08:30,743 --> 01:08:33,676
- Thank you. / - It's really unique.

1574
01:08:35,210 --> 01:08:37,776
- It's like green tea. / - Doesn't it smell like citrus tea?

1575
01:08:40,143 --> 01:08:42,776
(Honey lemon tea, $5.30)

1576
01:08:43,276 --> 01:08:44,243
Cheers.

1577
01:08:44,243 --> 01:08:46,376
Cheers to Hong Kong.

1578
01:08:50,543 --> 01:08:51,543
It's hot.

1579
01:08:51,543 --> 01:08:53,476
I know why they drink this a lot.

1580
01:08:53,476 --> 01:08:56,276
- When it's chilly... / - You won't catch a cold.

1581
01:08:56,276 --> 01:08:57,843
It really warms you up.

1582
01:08:59,110 --> 01:09:03,143
It feels like your whole body is

1583
01:09:03,143 --> 01:09:04,343
calming down.

1584
01:09:04,810 --> 01:09:06,010
Finally, Solar...

1585
01:09:06,310 --> 01:09:07,743
- She's calmed down. / - She's calmed.

1586
01:09:09,343 --> 01:09:11,276
She only calms down when it rains.

1587
01:09:12,676 --> 01:09:15,110
I think it's been a long time since

1588
01:09:15,110 --> 01:09:16,976
I've drunk something from a teacup.

1589
01:09:16,976 --> 01:09:20,043
- When we go to cafes... / - That's right.

1590
01:09:20,043 --> 01:09:21,276
You use plastic cups.

1591
01:09:21,276 --> 01:09:24,976
- Or it's always paper cups. / - But an actual cup...

1592
01:09:24,976 --> 01:09:25,776
It feels quite different.

1593
01:09:25,776 --> 01:09:29,243
- It feels like we're being served. / - Right.

1594
01:09:29,243 --> 01:09:29,776
That's right.

1595
01:09:29,776 --> 01:09:33,110
We're coming to the end of our trip.

1596
01:09:33,110 --> 01:09:35,043
It's our last night.

1597
01:09:35,043 --> 01:09:38,310
What was the most memorable thing during this trip?

1598
01:09:39,176 --> 01:09:40,376
Everything was wonderful.

1599
01:09:41,010 --> 01:09:43,943
But Disneyland was the most memorable for me.

1600
01:09:44,410 --> 01:09:47,643
It was so fun for me.

1601
01:09:47,643 --> 01:09:48,876
I found it fascinating.

1602
01:09:48,876 --> 01:09:50,110
She screamed so much.

1603
01:09:52,010 --> 01:09:53,243
- Solar's mouth. / - For me...

1604
01:09:53,676 --> 01:09:57,310
I liked it because I could come here

1605
01:09:57,310 --> 01:09:58,276
and visit

1606
01:09:58,276 --> 01:10:01,243
nice places and enjoy good food

1607
01:10:01,243 --> 01:10:02,543
with people I like.

1608
01:10:02,543 --> 01:10:03,843
That's what I liked.

1609
01:10:03,843 --> 01:10:06,076
I'm going to dwell on this trip for...

1610
01:10:06,076 --> 01:10:09,310
- At least 3 months. / - Will you dwell on it?

1611
01:10:10,176 --> 01:10:12,410
I'm going to work hard while thinking about this trip.

1612
01:10:12,410 --> 01:10:13,476
Sounds good.

1613
01:10:13,476 --> 01:10:15,910
- I can last 3 months. / - Okay.

1614
01:10:17,243 --> 01:10:18,810
The month before the trip is so good.

1615
01:10:18,810 --> 01:10:20,176
- Right. / - Then you relive the memories...

1616
01:10:20,176 --> 01:10:22,476
- For about 3 months after. / - Right.

1617
01:10:23,743 --> 01:10:27,610

1618
01:10:29,176 --> 01:10:33,876

01:10:33,876 --> 01:10:35,376
- Yong Kong. / - Byul Kong.

1620
01:10:35,376 --> 01:10:36,643
Hong Kong!

1621
01:10:36,643 --> 01:10:38,610
Battle Trip!

("I feel happy not when I reach the destination")

1623

("But while I take a trip" by Andrew Matthews)

1624
01:10:43,676 --> 01:10:46,176
We saw a new side of Hong Kong.

1625
01:10:46,176 --> 01:10:47,310
Yes.

1626
01:10:47,310 --> 01:10:50,276
I don't think I've ever seen this in Hong Kong.

1627
01:10:50,276 --> 01:10:51,610
Shall we check your budget?

1628
01:10:51,610 --> 01:10:53,643
They had a fruitful trip in Hong Kong.

1629
01:10:53,643 --> 01:10:55,143
We saw a new side of Hong Kong.

1630
01:10:55,143 --> 01:10:57,610
The Yong Kong Byul Kong Hong Kong Tour.

1631
01:10:57,610 --> 01:10:58,876
Let's find out their final budget.

1632
01:10:58,876 --> 01:11:02,376
Our Yong Kong Byul Kong Hong Kong Tour spent...

1633
01:11:02,376 --> 01:11:04,310
- For 3 days and 2 nights. / - 3 days and 2 nights.

1634
01:11:04,976 --> 01:11:06,143

01:11:06,143 --> 01:11:07,376
- It was? / - It was?

1636
01:11:07,376 --> 01:11:08,976
- Per person. / - Per person?

1637
01:11:09,710 --> 01:11:13,176
$426.10.

1638
01:11:14,643 --> 01:11:15,810
- Well, with this... / - It's...

1639
01:11:15,810 --> 01:11:17,343
- It wasn't cheap. / - Right.

1640
01:11:17,343 --> 01:11:19,510
But consider visiting a theme park,

1641
01:11:19,510 --> 01:11:22,276
buying a free pass.

1642
01:11:22,276 --> 01:11:24,976
And staying at the Disneyland hotel.

1643
01:11:24,976 --> 01:11:26,343
- If you consider that... / - Yes.

1644
01:11:26,343 --> 01:11:28,676
I thought it would cost more.

1645
01:11:28,676 --> 01:11:30,843
They also looked around every corner of Lantau Island.

1646
01:11:30,843 --> 01:11:31,910
That's right.

1647
01:11:31,910 --> 01:11:33,476
Considering everything,

1648
01:11:33,476 --> 01:11:35,976
you really had a fruitful holiday.

1649
01:11:35,976 --> 01:11:37,876
Yes, we really did.

1650
01:11:37,876 --> 01:11:39,410
Hong Kong was like an onion

1651
01:11:39,410 --> 01:11:40,776
with its infinite layers.

1652
01:11:40,776 --> 01:11:43,443
We introduced a new side of it.

1653
01:11:43,443 --> 01:11:45,643
You said you'd last 3 months.

1654
01:11:45,643 --> 01:11:47,976
- It hasn't been 3 months yet, right? / - Right.

1655
01:11:47,976 --> 01:11:50,076
Call us if another hardship comes along.

1656
01:11:50,076 --> 01:11:52,876
We'll send you on a trip that will last up to a year.

1657
01:11:52,876 --> 01:11:54,710
- Really? / - That would be great.

1658
01:11:54,710 --> 01:11:56,176
- Latin America? / - Europe, maybe?

1659
01:11:56,176 --> 01:11:58,110
But can we come on this show again?

1660
01:11:58,110 --> 01:11:59,276
- Of course. / - Really?

1661
01:11:59,276 --> 01:12:01,643
Many people have come on this show twice.

1662
01:12:01,643 --> 01:12:04,643
- Really? / - In Sandara Park's case...

1663
01:12:04,643 --> 01:12:06,976
- She's been here 3 times? / - She's filming now!

1664
01:12:06,976 --> 01:12:08,476
- Really? / - Yes.

1665
01:12:08,476 --> 01:12:10,143
You two had such great energy.

01:12:10,143 --> 01:12:13,310
- We all felt happy watching you. / - It was fun.

1667
01:12:13,310 --> 01:12:15,376
Next week, we'll see you again

1668
01:12:15,376 --> 01:12:17,176
with an intermediate course to Taiwan.

1669
01:12:17,176 --> 01:12:19,276
- Thank you. / - Thank you.

1670
01:12:23,410 --> 01:12:26,410

(Chorong and Hayoung's Tour)

1672
01:12:30,376 --> 01:12:31,310
So fun.

1673
01:12:32,210 --> 01:12:34,610
- So pretty. / - Seriously.

1674
01:12:34,610 --> 01:12:35,810
Wow.

1675

(Healing trip, great view before your eyes)

1676
01:12:38,110 --> 01:12:39,310
Amazing.

1677
01:12:41,376 --> 01:12:43,410
This place warms you up inside.

1678
01:12:43,910 --> 01:12:45,710
Wow, it's so pretty.

1679
01:12:45,710 --> 01:12:48,176
- This is amazing. / - It has hidden charm.
