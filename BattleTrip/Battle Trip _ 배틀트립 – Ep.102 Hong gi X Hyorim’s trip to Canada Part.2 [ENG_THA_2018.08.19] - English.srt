1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,474
Now, this is Canada!

2
00:00:01,474 --> 00:00:03,341
I want to live here, Seulgi!

3
00:00:03,341 --> 00:00:05,007
Niagara!

4
00:00:05,007 --> 00:00:06,307
(Canada has amazing nature)

5
00:00:07,507 --> 00:00:09,041
So pretty.

6
00:00:09,041 --> 00:00:11,041
This is made naturally.

7
00:00:11,041 --> 00:00:12,207
Wow!

8
00:00:12,207 --> 00:00:14,674
Here we go, here we go.

9
00:00:14,674 --> 00:00:16,407
Now, this is Europe.

10
00:00:16,407 --> 00:00:17,807
So pretty!

11
00:00:18,707 --> 00:00:20,541
Even this looks so pretty.

12
00:00:20,541 --> 00:00:21,807
You can't capture this beauty with a camera.

13
00:00:21,807 --> 00:00:22,807
No, you can't.

14
00:00:22,807 --> 00:00:24,807
I feel like I'm in a fairy tale.

15
00:00:24,807 --> 00:00:27,107
Yes, I'm a princess.

16
00:00:27,107 --> 00:00:29,074
There's nothing much

17
00:00:29,074 --> 00:00:30,907
in making a good country to live in.

18
00:00:30,907 --> 00:00:33,441
(Which team will win?)

19
00:00:35,874 --> 00:00:38,941
(Numerous great tips on trips)

20
00:00:39,807 --> 00:00:41,141
(Seo Hyorim, Lee Hongki of FTISLAND)

21
00:00:41,841 --> 00:00:43,074
(Wendy and Seulgi of Red Velvet)

22
00:00:43,674 --> 00:00:45,007
(Special host, Lee Teuk)

23
00:00:45,207 --> 00:00:46,374
Traveling is war!

24
00:00:46,374 --> 00:00:48,574
Battle Trip!

25
00:00:50,574 --> 00:00:52,507
Continuing from last week, this is the third week.

26
00:00:52,507 --> 00:00:54,641
We have our travelers who went on trips to

27
00:00:54,641 --> 00:00:56,141
the countries we'd want to live in.

28
00:00:56,141 --> 00:00:56,941
Welcome.

29
00:00:56,941 --> 00:00:58,241
- Welcome. / - Good to see you.

30
00:00:58,841 --> 00:01:00,741
Different outfits for this episode.

31
00:01:00,741 --> 00:01:03,574
Hongki's such a fashionista.

32
00:01:03,574 --> 00:01:04,574
- This? / - What is that?

33
00:01:04,574 --> 00:01:05,974
Not anyone can pull that off.

34
00:01:05,974 --> 00:01:07,407
Is that Choi Hongman's shirt?

35
00:01:07,407 --> 00:01:08,241
What was that?

36
00:01:09,441 --> 00:01:10,007
Is it a hospital gown?

37
00:01:10,007 --> 00:01:10,974
Are you a doctor?

38
00:01:10,974 --> 00:01:13,707
He looks like either a doctor or a patient.

39
00:01:13,707 --> 00:01:14,507
One of those two.

40
00:01:14,507 --> 00:01:17,474
I felt a bit sad going home last episode.

41
00:01:17,474 --> 00:01:18,674
My heart needs healing.

42
00:01:18,674 --> 00:01:21,607
- Right, last episode... / - Right.

43
00:01:21,607 --> 00:01:24,707
We lost 67 to 72. Just by 5 votes.

44
00:01:24,707 --> 00:01:27,341
- But it's not over yet. / - That's right.

45
00:01:27,341 --> 00:01:28,974
We have another battle left.

46
00:01:28,974 --> 00:01:31,307
And we're with our 100 judges in the audience

47
00:01:31,307 --> 00:01:32,374
that will be casting these votes.

48
00:01:32,374 --> 00:01:33,674
- Welcome. / - Hello.

49
00:01:33,674 --> 00:01:35,607
(100 judges in the audience)

50
00:01:35,607 --> 00:01:36,841
So, where will we go today?

51
00:01:36,841 --> 00:01:38,941
- A new battle will start. / - That's what's important.

52
00:01:38,941 --> 00:01:40,241
Where is it this time?

53
00:01:40,241 --> 00:01:43,041
- If you go to many big cities... / - Right.

54
00:01:43,041 --> 00:01:48,207
You might want to live in one of the smaller cities.

55
00:01:48,207 --> 00:01:50,607
So we'll check out some small cities.

56
00:01:50,607 --> 00:01:51,341
Small cities.

57
00:01:51,341 --> 00:01:54,007
This is a new term.

58
00:01:54,007 --> 00:01:55,807
It's related to traveling.

59
00:01:55,807 --> 00:01:57,274
- A staycation. / - Staycation.

60
00:01:57,274 --> 00:01:59,807
It means to stay in one place for a long time...

61
00:01:59,807 --> 00:02:03,107
- To relax and unwind. / - I love that.

62
00:02:03,107 --> 00:02:05,074
It's a combination of the words

63
00:02:05,074 --> 00:02:05,974
stay and vacation.

64
00:02:05,974 --> 00:02:07,174
- Vacation... / - Vacation...

65
00:02:07,174 --> 00:02:09,207
- Vacation? / - Vacation.

66
00:02:09,207 --> 00:02:10,907
Was that a German accent?

67
00:02:10,907 --> 00:02:12,774
Don't make me speak English.

68
00:02:12,774 --> 00:02:14,241
It's too hard.

69
00:02:14,241 --> 00:02:15,674
As long as you have time,

70
00:02:15,674 --> 00:02:17,841
who wouldn't want a staycation?

71
00:02:17,841 --> 00:02:18,774
- Of course. / - Sure.

72
00:02:18,774 --> 00:02:20,107
- Everyone would. / - For like a month or two.

73
00:02:20,107 --> 00:02:23,474
There are many small towns in Korea

74
00:02:23,474 --> 00:02:24,141
to travel to as well.

75
00:02:24,141 --> 00:02:26,974
We've introduced many places on this show.

76
00:02:26,974 --> 00:02:28,807
We went to the historical city of Gunsan.

77
00:02:28,807 --> 00:02:30,141
- Gunsan. / - Can't miss that out.

78
00:02:30,141 --> 00:02:32,374
- Next is Jinju and Hadong. / - Jinju and Hadong.

79
00:02:32,374 --> 00:02:34,974
That place is so popular these days.

80
00:02:34,974 --> 00:02:37,774
- Remember the camp site they went to? / - Yes.

81
00:02:37,774 --> 00:02:39,641
It's all booked up until the end of the year.

82
00:02:40,407 --> 00:02:41,374
Until the end of the year?

83
00:02:41,374 --> 00:02:43,207
I went to southern Italy

84
00:02:43,207 --> 00:02:45,174
on Battle Trip 2 years ago.

85
00:02:45,174 --> 00:02:48,541
Amalfi, Positano,

86
00:02:48,541 --> 00:02:51,607
Ravello and Capri are all small cities.

87
00:02:51,607 --> 00:02:52,974
That's when I started

88
00:02:52,974 --> 00:02:56,707
getting into visiting small cities.

89
00:02:56,707 --> 00:02:58,074
So last year around this time,

90
00:02:58,074 --> 00:03:00,841
I traveled to small cities in Germany.

91
00:03:00,841 --> 00:03:02,574
I started at Wurzburg

92
00:03:02,574 --> 00:03:04,307
and went all the way to Fussen

93
00:03:04,307 --> 00:03:05,474
like it was a road trip.

94
00:03:05,474 --> 00:03:07,674
I checked out each village along the way.

95
00:03:07,674 --> 00:03:08,941
- She memorized all the names. / - I have a question.

96
00:03:08,941 --> 00:03:10,174
How do you memorize all the places?

97
00:03:10,174 --> 00:03:12,474
- When do you work? / - Seriously.

98
00:03:14,041 --> 00:03:16,607
I take a trip the day after I finish my dramas.

99
00:03:16,607 --> 00:03:19,041
She didn't work for some time and just traveled.

100
00:03:20,707 --> 00:03:23,007
You spend more time abroad than in Seoul.

101
00:03:23,007 --> 00:03:24,007
Do you hate Seoul that much?

102
00:03:24,007 --> 00:03:26,841
No, I love it.

103
00:03:27,974 --> 00:03:31,374
Wendy said last episode that Seoul's the best.

104
00:03:31,374 --> 00:03:32,574
That Cheongdam is the best.

105
00:03:32,574 --> 00:03:33,407
Wendy said that.

106
00:03:33,407 --> 00:03:35,741
Wendy, you lived in Canada.

107
00:03:35,741 --> 00:03:36,574
Can you tell us about

108
00:03:36,574 --> 00:03:37,807
the small cities around where you lived?

109
00:03:37,807 --> 00:03:40,674
I lived in Toronto and it was nice there.

110
00:03:40,674 --> 00:03:43,574
But I really liked Quebec and Montreal.

111
00:03:43,574 --> 00:03:44,807
- Quebec... / - They have a lot of festivals.

112
00:03:44,807 --> 00:03:46,041
- It's nice there. / - I haven't been there.

113
00:03:46,041 --> 00:03:47,374
- It was so nice. / - Quebec.

114
00:03:47,374 --> 00:03:49,641
It's a bit different from Canada.

115
00:03:49,641 --> 00:03:51,207
It's like Europe in Canada.

116
00:03:51,207 --> 00:03:52,274
- France. / - Yes.

117
00:03:52,274 --> 00:03:53,307
- Right. / - That's right.

118
00:03:53,307 --> 00:03:55,041
- They speak in French there too. / - Right.

119
00:03:55,041 --> 00:03:56,107
So it's a bit different.

120
00:03:56,107 --> 00:03:58,374
- The place we went to... / - You'll see.

121
00:03:58,374 --> 00:03:59,774
It's like that too.

122
00:03:59,774 --> 00:04:00,641
We're good then.

123
00:04:00,641 --> 00:04:03,174
It's a place that isn't well-known in Korea.

124
00:04:03,174 --> 00:04:06,174
There isn't a lot of information about this place...

125
00:04:06,174 --> 00:04:09,174
- On Korean blogs either. / - We won this one.

126
00:04:09,174 --> 00:04:11,307
Let's see where it is on the map.

127
00:04:11,307 --> 00:04:12,674
Small cities in Canada.

128
00:04:12,674 --> 00:04:13,641
Where?

129
00:04:13,641 --> 00:04:16,407
We stayed at Niagara Falls.

130
00:04:16,407 --> 00:04:19,341
Across that is Niagara-on-the-Lake.

131
00:04:19,341 --> 00:04:21,107
That village is so pretty.

132
00:04:21,107 --> 00:04:24,474
- Canada is known for icewine. / - Right.

133
00:04:24,474 --> 00:04:26,707
It gets really cold there in the winter.

134
00:04:26,707 --> 00:04:29,741
There's this one winery where the wine...

135
00:04:29,741 --> 00:04:32,441
- Keeps freezing and thawing. / - A winery.

136
00:04:32,441 --> 00:04:34,141
If that process keeps repeating...

137
00:04:34,141 --> 00:04:36,007
- It makes the wine sweeter. / - Right.

138
00:04:36,007 --> 00:04:38,241
- Great for grape farms. / - Yes.

139
00:04:38,241 --> 00:04:40,207
So we went to that winery.

140
00:04:40,207 --> 00:04:42,707
- BoA likes wineries. / - BoA's song.

141
00:04:42,707 --> 00:04:44,474
♪ Winery ♪

142
00:04:44,474 --> 00:04:45,941
♪ Winery ♪

143
00:04:45,941 --> 00:04:47,774
(Why, Lee Teuk? Why?)

144
00:04:47,774 --> 00:04:49,274
Why'd you make me do that?

145
00:04:49,774 --> 00:04:52,241
I saw on the map that the 3 cities...

146
00:04:52,241 --> 00:04:54,807
- Are a bit spaced out. / - They're far apart.

147
00:04:54,807 --> 00:04:56,274
We didn't use a car.

148
00:04:56,274 --> 00:04:59,941
We used an amazing mode of transportation.

149
00:04:59,941 --> 00:05:02,107
- Magnetic levitation train? / - Amazing?

150
00:05:02,107 --> 00:05:04,407
The ground...

151
00:05:04,407 --> 00:05:05,441
- It's off the ground? / - Yes.

152
00:05:05,441 --> 00:05:07,007
- It flew. / - Like Iron Man.

153
00:05:07,007 --> 00:05:08,407
- Like Iron Man. / - It floats off the ground?

154
00:05:08,407 --> 00:05:09,707
Are you going to reveal that

155
00:05:09,707 --> 00:05:13,407
you spent like $8,400 on this trip later on?

156
00:05:13,407 --> 00:05:14,341
- No. / - Did you take a helicopter?

157
00:05:14,341 --> 00:05:16,141
I looked into this already.

158
00:05:16,141 --> 00:05:17,107
We had one in the U.S.

159
00:05:17,107 --> 00:05:19,807
Once in the U.S. over the Rocky Mountains.

160
00:05:19,807 --> 00:05:22,107
- I bet it costs a ton. / - It's a lot cheaper.

161
00:05:22,107 --> 00:05:24,107
- Really? / - So around $3,800?

162
00:05:24,107 --> 00:05:25,574
No, no.

163
00:05:25,574 --> 00:05:28,474
You don't get to ride a helicopter every day.

164
00:05:28,474 --> 00:05:31,107
But if you ride one when you're traveling,

165
00:05:31,107 --> 00:05:33,707
you'll remember it forever.

166
00:05:33,707 --> 00:05:34,907
It'll be a memory.

167
00:05:34,907 --> 00:05:37,607
You always want to splurge a little when traveling.

168
00:05:37,607 --> 00:05:39,674
And for me, it was the helicopter ride.

169
00:05:39,674 --> 00:05:40,741
Wasn't everything like that?

170
00:05:40,741 --> 00:05:44,041
Hongki, tell us what we should watch out for.

171
00:05:44,041 --> 00:05:46,174
We went to Canada to travel.

172
00:05:46,174 --> 00:05:50,074
Since it's close to Canada,

173
00:05:50,074 --> 00:05:53,374
we crossed the border to the U.S.

174
00:05:53,374 --> 00:05:54,774
It's like this.

175
00:05:54,774 --> 00:05:57,074
You're in Canada and you want to check out the U.S.,

176
00:05:57,074 --> 00:05:59,441
you can go and come right back.

177
00:05:59,441 --> 00:06:01,607
That's how it was like.

178
00:06:01,607 --> 00:06:04,107
- But isn't that cheating? / - Why?

179
00:06:04,107 --> 00:06:06,274
It's Canada versus Austria.

180
00:06:06,274 --> 00:06:08,341
But if you go to the U.S.,

181
00:06:08,341 --> 00:06:09,607
that's a different country.

182
00:06:09,607 --> 00:06:11,507
If we knew that ahead of time, we would've...

183
00:06:11,507 --> 00:06:13,574
Our team could've been all over the map.

184
00:06:13,574 --> 00:06:14,674
They were in the center of Europe.

185
00:06:14,674 --> 00:06:16,541
They could've gone to Germany, Hungary...

186
00:06:16,541 --> 00:06:17,641
Switzerland, Italy...

187
00:06:17,641 --> 00:06:19,507
Our team went to the U.S.

188
00:06:19,507 --> 00:06:21,141
because we just wanted to get

189
00:06:21,141 --> 00:06:22,907
the most out of our trip.

190
00:06:22,907 --> 00:06:24,207
That's how it is.

191
00:06:26,207 --> 00:06:28,507
Let's see Realistic Sibling Tour to

192
00:06:28,507 --> 00:06:30,074
some small cities in Canada!

193
00:06:33,941 --> 00:06:36,907
(Canada is where nature lives and breathes)

194
00:06:36,907 --> 00:06:38,874
I feel like I'm getting sucked in.

195
00:06:38,874 --> 00:06:40,107
(Voted second best country to live in)

196
00:06:40,107 --> 00:06:42,041
Last episode was amazing.

197
00:06:42,041 --> 00:06:45,907
(Realistic Sibling Tour to Canada)

198
00:06:45,907 --> 00:06:47,807
Do you all see the view?

199
00:06:50,841 --> 00:06:54,241
(The nature is truly amazing)

200
00:06:55,907 --> 00:06:56,841
Niagara mist.

201
00:06:57,374 --> 00:06:58,974
I have to take that boat ride.

202
00:06:58,974 --> 00:07:01,541
This is made naturally.

203
00:07:01,541 --> 00:07:02,907
Wow, it's so pretty.

204
00:07:03,574 --> 00:07:04,874
A lake.

205
00:07:04,874 --> 00:07:06,807
(Sault Ste. Marie is famous for their maple trees)

206
00:07:06,807 --> 00:07:08,174
This really feels like Canada!

207
00:07:10,641 --> 00:07:12,174
It's so pretty.

208
00:07:12,174 --> 00:07:14,041
(People want to live in Canada for the nature)

209
00:07:14,307 --> 00:07:16,041
Did you see the nature?

210
00:07:16,041 --> 00:07:16,974
Let's go.

211
00:07:16,974 --> 00:07:18,507
Let's go!

212
00:07:18,507 --> 00:07:20,241
(Let's check out the small cities of Canada!)

213
00:07:21,574 --> 00:07:23,974
This will be our first time in Canada.

214
00:07:23,974 --> 00:07:25,407
I don't know much about traveling.

215
00:07:25,407 --> 00:07:27,507
It's best to find a center place to stay

216
00:07:27,507 --> 00:07:32,141
so the distance we travel is minimized.

217
00:07:32,141 --> 00:07:34,974
It's too far to travel to each city.

218
00:07:34,974 --> 00:07:36,907
- So... / - We're not going to rent a car, are we?

219
00:07:36,907 --> 00:07:37,941
We are.

220
00:07:37,941 --> 00:07:40,074
I rented a car on my trip to London...

221
00:07:40,074 --> 00:07:42,141
- And drove for 3 to 4 hours at a time. / - Really?

222
00:07:42,141 --> 00:07:43,241
- Yeah. / - Really?

223
00:07:43,241 --> 00:07:44,741
Yes.

224
00:07:45,641 --> 00:07:47,141
That's so cool.

225
00:07:47,141 --> 00:07:48,474
- So cool. / - She's like a foreigner.

226
00:07:48,474 --> 00:07:50,507
I think I rent a car

227
00:07:50,507 --> 00:07:51,974
whenever I go abroad.

228
00:07:51,974 --> 00:07:53,874
- I think I saw it on your social media page. / - Right?

229
00:07:53,874 --> 00:07:55,607
That's good then. You can drive.

230
00:07:56,841 --> 00:07:58,474
(Flustered)

231
00:07:58,474 --> 00:08:01,407
- I don't get to travel that often. / - Right.

232
00:08:01,407 --> 00:08:04,174
I get to visit countries to perform...

233
00:08:04,174 --> 00:08:05,641
- But not really for traveling. / - Right.

234
00:08:05,641 --> 00:08:09,207
I always end up in the biggest city of that country.

235
00:08:09,207 --> 00:08:11,841
Like Paris in France.

236
00:08:11,841 --> 00:08:14,274
That's all I get to do.

237
00:08:14,274 --> 00:08:17,407
I'll leave this trip up to you, Hyorim.

238
00:08:17,407 --> 00:08:18,274
I'm not good with this stuff.

239
00:08:18,274 --> 00:08:21,841
You mostly travel to the big cities.

240
00:08:21,841 --> 00:08:22,741
Right.

241
00:08:22,741 --> 00:08:23,874
That's why...

242
00:08:23,874 --> 00:08:27,707
I think we should check out the small cities

243
00:08:27,707 --> 00:08:28,974
for this trip.

244
00:08:28,974 --> 00:08:31,474
Places people wouldn't go to.

245
00:08:31,474 --> 00:08:35,041
So, there's Kingston.

246
00:08:35,041 --> 00:08:37,007
As well as Niagara-on-the-Lake.

247
00:08:37,007 --> 00:08:39,674
It's just 30 minutes away from Niagara Falls.

248
00:08:39,674 --> 00:08:42,407
There's a village straight out of a fairy tale.

249
00:08:42,407 --> 00:08:44,141
I want to go now.

250
00:08:44,141 --> 00:08:45,741
We'll be leaving soon.

251
00:08:45,741 --> 00:08:46,607
Yeah.

252
00:08:47,441 --> 00:08:48,807
The small cities...

253
00:08:48,807 --> 00:08:50,941
- Where Koreans... / - It was so nice.

254
00:08:50,941 --> 00:08:52,374
- For me... / - Amazing.

255
00:08:52,374 --> 00:08:55,274
It's called the Thousand Islands.

256
00:08:55,274 --> 00:08:58,774
But there are actually 1,856 islands.

257
00:08:59,607 --> 00:09:01,441
Wow, what is that?

258
00:09:01,441 --> 00:09:02,541
This is awesome, Hyorim.

259
00:09:02,541 --> 00:09:03,307
Isn't it?

260
00:09:03,307 --> 00:09:06,074
(A special helicopter)

261
00:09:06,074 --> 00:09:07,941
It's all frozen inside.

262
00:09:09,741 --> 00:09:11,741
This is the stuff I like.

263
00:09:12,341 --> 00:09:13,474
Ring, ring.

264
00:09:13,474 --> 00:09:15,841

265
00:09:15,841 --> 00:09:18,707

(Noisy)

268
00:09:22,441 --> 00:09:24,541
(Lively)

269
00:09:24,541 --> 00:09:25,441
Wow!

270
00:09:25,441 --> 00:09:29,374
(Their trip to the small cities of Canada starts now)

271
00:09:31,141 --> 00:09:35,507
(It's day 4 of their trip in Canada)

272
00:09:36,074 --> 00:09:41,607
(The weather is nice again)

273
00:09:42,474 --> 00:09:46,941
(Niagara Falls, 7:00 a.m.)

274
00:09:48,007 --> 00:09:49,307
Let's go!

275
00:09:49,974 --> 00:09:51,707
For today's schedule...

276
00:09:51,707 --> 00:09:53,641
- Kingston. / - Why did we wake up so early?

277
00:09:53,641 --> 00:09:54,941
We're going a bit far today.

278
00:09:54,941 --> 00:09:56,474
We're going to Kingston.

279
00:09:59,707 --> 00:10:01,241
(Kingston)

280
00:10:01,241 --> 00:10:03,774
(Called the living history of Canada)

281
00:10:03,774 --> 00:10:06,074
(The first capital of Canada)

282
00:10:06,074 --> 00:10:11,607
(European-style buildings from British colonization).

283
00:10:11,607 --> 00:10:14,007
(Kingston is a great place to travel to)

284
00:10:14,007 --> 00:10:17,307
(Because you can see the Thousand Islands)

285
00:10:17,307 --> 00:10:18,274
What's that?

286
00:10:18,274 --> 00:10:19,407
That's so cool!

287
00:10:19,407 --> 00:10:21,907
There were flags.

288
00:10:21,907 --> 00:10:23,174
Of other countries.

289
00:10:23,174 --> 00:10:25,674
The owner's country.

290
00:10:26,474 --> 00:10:29,841
(A famous place to travel to for the rich)

291
00:10:34,641 --> 00:10:38,141
(It's popular to take a tour of Heart Island)

292
00:10:39,941 --> 00:10:40,774
Check this out.

293
00:10:40,774 --> 00:10:42,307
Ta-da!

294
00:10:42,307 --> 00:10:44,241
- What the... / - I got this for you.

295
00:10:44,241 --> 00:10:45,141
It's even blue.

296
00:10:45,141 --> 00:10:46,007
Oh, my God!

297
00:10:46,874 --> 00:10:48,041
Wow, that's so cool.

298
00:10:48,041 --> 00:10:48,741
A convertible?

299
00:10:48,741 --> 00:10:50,107
- That's the car? / - Right.

300
00:10:50,107 --> 00:10:50,941
This is ours?

301
00:10:51,807 --> 00:10:53,407
(You need one to tour small cities)

302
00:10:53,407 --> 00:10:56,074
It would be great to ride a convertible there.

303
00:10:56,074 --> 00:10:56,974
Right.

304
00:10:56,974 --> 00:11:00,507
I almost always rent a car when I travel abroad.

305
00:11:00,507 --> 00:11:01,274
Especially for small cities.

306
00:11:01,274 --> 00:11:02,574
You need an international license, right?

307
00:11:02,574 --> 00:11:04,274
You need an international license

308
00:11:04,274 --> 00:11:05,374
and your Korean license.

309
00:11:05,374 --> 00:11:07,841
Right.

310
00:11:07,841 --> 00:11:08,841

316
00:11:18,907 --> 00:11:22,674
(Niagara Falls is their base camp)

317
00:11:22,674 --> 00:11:24,474
(Kingston is a 4-hour drive away)

318
00:11:24,474 --> 00:11:26,341
It must be nice to drive in a place like that.

319
00:11:26,341 --> 00:11:27,374
A 4-hour drive?

320
00:11:28,641 --> 00:11:30,574
It's not tiring to drive abroad

321
00:11:30,574 --> 00:11:32,341
in a place like that for 4 hours.

322
00:11:32,341 --> 00:11:34,974
I love how I can just drive without thinking.

323
00:11:34,974 --> 00:11:36,541
Not many traffic lights.

324
00:11:36,541 --> 00:11:38,341
Isn't this nice?

325
00:11:38,341 --> 00:11:39,807
Perfect for driving.

326
00:11:41,941 --> 00:11:45,774

He's tired now.

335

He's tired now.

336
00:12:19,441 --> 00:12:21,307
This road won't end!

337
00:12:22,207 --> 00:12:24,074
He started complaining.

338
00:12:24,074 --> 00:12:26,074
I was excited at first that

339
00:12:26,074 --> 00:12:28,774
there's no traffic and there's all this nature.

340
00:12:28,774 --> 00:12:31,074
But everything looks the same!

341
00:12:31,074 --> 00:12:33,241
4 hours might seem long to us...

342
00:12:33,241 --> 00:12:35,374
But it's not considered long in other countries.

343
00:12:35,374 --> 00:12:38,241
For Canada, "nearby" is 3 hours away.

344
00:12:38,241 --> 00:12:40,174
4 hours is like us going to Bundang from Seoul.

345
00:12:40,174 --> 00:12:41,074
- The next town over. / - Right.

346
00:12:41,074 --> 00:12:43,374
- It's the next town. / - 5 to 6 hours and you're there.

347
00:12:44,241 --> 00:12:45,341
Right, that's how it is.

348
00:12:45,341 --> 00:12:47,974
That's why you need cruise control in the U.S.

349
00:12:47,974 --> 00:12:49,174
Just leave it on.

350
00:12:50,241 --> 00:12:52,241
- It's tiring for us. / - Can't keep your foot on the pedal.

351
00:12:52,974 --> 00:12:54,774
This is insane!

352
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:56,441
This is what road trips are like.

353
00:12:56,441 --> 00:12:57,874
This is Battle Trip.

354
00:12:58,541 --> 00:13:02,241
(Ontario, Canada is 10 times the size of Korea)

355
00:13:02,741 --> 00:13:04,974
Just what is in Kingston?

356
00:13:04,974 --> 00:13:07,541
There's a heart-shaped island

357
00:13:07,541 --> 00:13:09,707
you can see from the sky.

358
00:13:09,707 --> 00:13:12,807
And the guy that owned it is named Boldt.

359
00:13:12,807 --> 00:13:15,341
His beloved wife fell ill.

360
00:13:15,341 --> 00:13:18,174
So he built a castle for her.

361
00:13:18,174 --> 00:13:19,141
(The secret behind Heart Island)

362
00:13:19,141 --> 00:13:21,374
(Hotelier Boldt started building a castle)

363
00:13:21,374 --> 00:13:24,274
(On a heart-shaped island for his wife)

364
00:13:24,274 --> 00:13:27,241
(She died of illness right before completion)

365
00:13:27,241 --> 00:13:33,041
(He stopped construction and never returned again)

366
00:13:33,041 --> 00:13:34,107
(The castle was sold for $1 by the descendants)

367
00:13:34,107 --> 00:13:35,441
(A U.S. company completed the construction)

368
00:13:35,441 --> 00:13:37,307
It was sold for $1.

369
00:13:38,041 --> 00:13:39,941
Then they finished the castle.

370
00:13:39,941 --> 00:13:42,507
Now it's a tourist attraction.

371
00:13:48,207 --> 00:13:48,874
For $1?

372
00:13:48,874 --> 00:13:50,474
- $1. / - I should've bought it back then.

373
00:13:51,307 --> 00:13:52,474
- I have a question. / - What?

374
00:13:52,474 --> 00:13:55,207
Do girls want to go to places

375
00:13:55,207 --> 00:13:56,741
with romantic stories like that?

376
00:13:56,741 --> 00:13:58,941
Yeah!

377
00:13:58,941 --> 00:14:02,341
A place with history.

378
00:14:02,341 --> 00:14:05,107
And it's romantic too.

379
00:14:06,007 --> 00:14:07,307
I find it interesting that

380
00:14:07,307 --> 00:14:09,707
girls go to see this stuff.

381
00:14:09,707 --> 00:14:11,074
We travel far to see things like that.

382
00:14:11,074 --> 00:14:12,141
It really is heart-shaped.

383
00:14:14,641 --> 00:14:15,841
(Trip to the small cities in Canada)

384
00:14:15,841 --> 00:14:19,374
(A cruise around the Thousand Islands)

385
00:14:20,074 --> 00:14:24,307
(The dock for the Thousand Islands cruise)

386
00:14:25,241 --> 00:14:28,307
(It rains as soon as they get there)

387
00:14:28,307 --> 00:14:30,074
It's not so nice out today.

388
00:14:30,074 --> 00:14:30,974
Let's go!

389
00:14:30,974 --> 00:14:33,941
Do we have to go when it's raining?

390
00:14:33,941 --> 00:14:34,941
He doesn't want to go.

391
00:14:34,941 --> 00:14:36,941
He kept complaining.

392
00:14:36,941 --> 00:14:38,574
He yelled at me a lot.

393
00:14:38,574 --> 00:14:39,574
I didn't know it would rain.

394
00:14:39,574 --> 00:14:41,374
It started raining on the way here.

395
00:14:41,374 --> 00:14:43,907
Let's cancel this plan today, Hyorim.

396
00:14:43,907 --> 00:14:47,007
But we drove all the way here...

397
00:14:47,007 --> 00:14:49,741
I can't help that it started raining.

398
00:14:49,741 --> 00:14:51,274
It was raining when we left.

399
00:14:51,274 --> 00:14:52,241
He keeps complaining.

400
00:14:52,241 --> 00:14:55,141
Hongki's concept for this trip is the complainer.

401
00:14:56,841 --> 00:14:59,141
(The Thousand Islands cruise, $37.50)

402
00:14:59,141 --> 00:15:00,741
That's the Saint Lawrence River.

403
00:15:00,741 --> 00:15:04,607
It leads all the way to sea.

404
00:15:04,607 --> 00:15:05,774
(The Thousand Islands cruise)

405
00:15:05,774 --> 00:15:06,741
(From 30-minute cruises to one that serves dinner)

406
00:15:06,741 --> 00:15:07,541
What's that house?

407
00:15:08,107 --> 00:15:09,241
What's that house?

408
00:15:09,241 --> 00:15:10,507
- Is that really an island? / - That's an island too.

409
00:15:10,507 --> 00:15:12,341
- That's an island? / - Didn't it float to there?

410
00:15:12,341 --> 00:15:13,774
It's an island.

411
00:15:13,774 --> 00:15:15,407
- It's like a bathroom. / - Isn't that still moving?

412
00:15:16,341 --> 00:15:20,274
(Some islands are natural and some are man-made)

413
00:15:21,141 --> 00:15:23,107
At least we have a roof.

414
00:15:23,107 --> 00:15:25,674
It's fine even though it's raining.

415
00:15:29,907 --> 00:15:32,907
This place is called the Thousand Islands.

416
00:15:32,907 --> 00:15:37,574
But there are actually around 1,856 islands.

417
00:15:39,541 --> 00:15:42,807
Wow, 1,865...

418
00:15:42,807 --> 00:15:44,374
Most of them are vacation homes.

419
00:15:45,041 --> 00:15:47,407
Most people own a yacht.

420
00:15:49,374 --> 00:15:52,607
(Various islands can be seen on the cruise)

421
00:15:52,607 --> 00:15:53,974
Look at that vacation home.

422
00:15:53,974 --> 00:15:56,174
- You could fish from your house. / - Right.

423
00:15:56,174 --> 00:15:58,541
Each island belongs to someone.

424
00:15:58,541 --> 00:16:01,074
You'll see flags on each island.

425
00:16:01,074 --> 00:16:04,707
Flags of Japan, America, France...

426
00:16:04,707 --> 00:16:08,074
That's where the island owner is from.

427
00:16:08,074 --> 00:16:10,141
But not a single Korean flag yet.

428
00:16:10,141 --> 00:16:13,141
Prepare your cameras. A nice island is coming up.

429
00:16:13,141 --> 00:16:15,707
Prepare your cameras. A nice island is coming up.

430
00:16:16,541 --> 00:16:17,541
Where? Where?

431
00:16:17,541 --> 00:16:19,941
Where do I point my camera?

432
00:16:19,941 --> 00:16:21,007
This one?

433
00:16:22,441 --> 00:16:25,241
- Oh, this... / - Those islands are very unique.

434
00:16:25,241 --> 00:16:27,907
The left island belongs to America

435
00:16:27,907 --> 00:16:29,407
and the right one belongs to Canada.

436
00:16:29,407 --> 00:16:32,041
- With a bridge connects them. / - Two islands.

437
00:16:32,774 --> 00:16:33,974
Two different islands.

438
00:16:33,974 --> 00:16:35,307
I guess they're named differently too.

439
00:16:35,307 --> 00:16:38,374
It's nice to check out the different islands.

440
00:16:42,541 --> 00:16:43,874
This is so nice.

441
00:16:43,874 --> 00:16:46,341
(Hongki was indoors to avoid the rain)

442
00:16:47,107 --> 00:16:50,041
(Now he's enjoying the cruise)

443
00:16:50,807 --> 00:16:52,441
With some coffee...

444
00:16:52,441 --> 00:16:55,807
I get to relax and check out the islands.

445
00:16:58,707 --> 00:16:59,674
(This is what true siblings look like)

446
00:16:59,674 --> 00:17:00,907
I see another boat.

447
00:17:00,907 --> 00:17:02,707
The islands...

448
00:17:02,707 --> 00:17:04,607
(They sit separately but they don't miss a thing)

449
00:17:04,607 --> 00:17:07,107
They're designed according to personal preference.

450
00:17:08,241 --> 00:17:10,874
We are now passing through the U.S.

451
00:17:10,874 --> 00:17:12,941
- We're passing the U.S. / - We're in the U.S.

452
00:17:12,941 --> 00:17:13,741
The U.S.

453
00:17:15,907 --> 00:17:16,941
That's the U.S.

454
00:17:18,407 --> 00:17:20,841
(They're sitting apart but they think alike)

455
00:17:21,441 --> 00:17:24,741
I can just hear him complaining now.

456
00:17:25,307 --> 00:17:26,507
Oh, whatever.

457
00:17:26,507 --> 00:17:27,541
I don't want to hear it.

458
00:17:27,541 --> 00:17:30,674
Man! Who said it wasn't cold out here? Geez!

459
00:17:30,674 --> 00:17:31,741
So many complaints.

460
00:17:32,874 --> 00:17:33,907
So funny.

461
00:17:34,774 --> 00:17:37,207
Do you know why there are no people up here?

462
00:17:37,207 --> 00:17:38,041
I know.

463
00:17:38,041 --> 00:17:39,707
Because it's rainy and cold.

464
00:17:39,707 --> 00:17:41,907
They're just giving us some space.

465
00:17:41,907 --> 00:17:43,674
Then you stay here alone.

466
00:17:44,941 --> 00:17:47,007
Why is there a home there?

467
00:17:47,007 --> 00:17:49,641
These islands are all owned by people.

468
00:17:49,641 --> 00:17:50,741
Really?

469
00:17:50,741 --> 00:17:51,641
Yeah, so that's why...

470
00:17:51,641 --> 00:17:54,641
Soyou bought property here?

471
00:17:55,874 --> 00:17:56,907
There he goes again.

472
00:17:57,974 --> 00:17:59,541
Sorry about that.

473
00:17:59,541 --> 00:18:00,607
Sorry about that.

474
00:18:01,474 --> 00:18:02,641
I want to get off now.

475
00:18:03,541 --> 00:18:06,807
I want to go back!

476
00:18:08,241 --> 00:18:12,941
- ♪ Please open up ♪ / - Please listen to me!

477
00:18:12,941 --> 00:18:14,574
He really never listens.

478
00:18:15,307 --> 00:18:16,474
Why was I acting like that?

479
00:18:17,807 --> 00:18:19,774
Did you bring your passport?

480
00:18:19,774 --> 00:18:21,074
Your passport.

481
00:18:21,074 --> 00:18:22,207
- Why? / - Your passport.

482
00:18:22,207 --> 00:18:23,941
We're going to the U.S.

483
00:18:25,174 --> 00:18:26,441
(The U.S.? Isn't this Canada?)

484
00:18:26,441 --> 00:18:30,574
The island we're going to is in the U.S.

485
00:18:30,574 --> 00:18:33,441
You need a passport and visa to go.

486
00:18:33,441 --> 00:18:37,174
So you have to apply for a visa.

487
00:18:37,174 --> 00:18:38,774
This is the U.S.

488
00:18:38,774 --> 00:18:40,241
- Let's go. / - Let's go.

489
00:18:40,241 --> 00:18:41,707
(They arrive at the romantic Heart Island)

490
00:18:41,707 --> 00:18:42,707
Let's go.

491
00:18:42,707 --> 00:18:43,641
Let's go.

492
00:18:44,307 --> 00:18:45,441
You've arrived in the U.S.?

493
00:18:45,441 --> 00:18:46,907
- Yes. / - Yes.

494
00:18:46,907 --> 00:18:48,274
Wow, awesome.

495
00:18:50,607 --> 00:18:51,707
It's this way.

496
00:18:51,707 --> 00:18:54,207
So, you use different money here?

497
00:18:54,207 --> 00:18:56,407
- Only U.S. dollars. / - Dollars.

498
00:18:57,541 --> 00:18:58,541
That looks like a church.

499
00:18:58,541 --> 00:19:00,107
(Boldt Castle entrance fee, $19.50)

500
00:19:00,107 --> 00:19:03,374
Do those small things count as islands too?

501
00:19:03,374 --> 00:19:04,974
If it is, I'll buy it.

502
00:19:04,974 --> 00:19:07,507
It's an island if there are at least 2 trees?

503
00:19:07,507 --> 00:19:09,141
Is this American rain?

504
00:19:09,141 --> 00:19:11,007
Yeah, this is American rain.

505
00:19:11,007 --> 00:19:13,507
♪ American rain is falling ♪

506

507
00:19:17,574 --> 00:19:21,007
Play my song, "In the Rain" as the background song.

508
00:19:21,007 --> 00:19:21,974
You have a song called "In the Rain?"

509

510
00:19:26,874 --> 00:19:29,674
(They're about to enter Boldt Castle)

511
00:19:31,241 --> 00:19:36,541
(It's like something you'd see in your fantasy)

512
00:19:38,107 --> 00:19:39,307
So nice.

513
00:19:40,141 --> 00:19:42,374
It doesn't seem American or Canadian.

514
00:19:42,374 --> 00:19:43,441
It seems European.

515
00:19:44,374 --> 00:19:46,407
What is this castle? Just for looking around in?

516
00:19:46,407 --> 00:19:51,107
It's open to the public like a museum.

517
00:19:51,107 --> 00:19:53,274
It's like a memorial hall.

518
00:19:53,274 --> 00:19:54,407
So cool.

519
00:19:55,374 --> 00:19:58,274
I bet it has some elements of the U.S. and Canada.

520
00:19:58,274 --> 00:20:00,407
The person, Boldt...

521
00:20:00,407 --> 00:20:02,607
- For his wife. / - He built this for his wife.

522
00:20:02,607 --> 00:20:04,207
That story...

523
00:20:04,207 --> 00:20:07,341
- It strikes a chord for women. / - It's romantic.

524
00:20:07,341 --> 00:20:08,874
- Yes, it's romantic. / - That's so cool.

525
00:20:10,707 --> 00:20:12,407
- Family... / - Boldt.

526
00:20:12,407 --> 00:20:14,041
- Family suite. / - Entrance.

527
00:20:14,041 --> 00:20:16,974
Oh, the family's suite.

528
00:20:21,107 --> 00:20:22,707
So, this is how it used to be.

529
00:20:23,807 --> 00:20:24,907
You're right.

530
00:20:27,641 --> 00:20:28,441
George Boldt.

531
00:20:28,441 --> 00:20:30,774
This is...

532
00:20:30,774 --> 00:20:33,874
Where he slept.

533
00:20:33,874 --> 00:20:36,074
They stopped construction here too.

534
00:20:36,074 --> 00:20:39,574
It was like this.

535
00:20:39,574 --> 00:20:42,474
- It's so pretty. / - So pretty.

536
00:20:42,474 --> 00:20:43,774
So, this is...

537
00:20:43,774 --> 00:20:46,541
Like the living room where the family gets together.

538
00:20:46,541 --> 00:20:49,207
Where they can have coffee or tea.

539
00:20:49,207 --> 00:20:51,041
This place wasn't finished either.

540
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:53,907
- There's a sad story here. / - Yeah.

541
00:20:54,974 --> 00:20:57,207
It was so sad that it was sold for a dollar.

542
00:20:58,407 --> 00:21:00,241
- No, it's not like that. / - His loved one died.

543
00:21:00,241 --> 00:21:01,941
- So it was pointless. / - He didn't bother finishing it.

544
00:21:01,941 --> 00:21:04,741
It lost its commercial value.

545
00:21:04,741 --> 00:21:06,407
Wendy, do you want to go?

546
00:21:06,407 --> 00:21:07,607
I feel sad.

547
00:21:09,907 --> 00:21:12,541
- Where they can have coffee or tea. / - So pretty.

548
00:21:12,541 --> 00:21:15,107
This place wasn't finished either.

549
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:16,707
They finished it so it looks how it would've.

550
00:21:17,741 --> 00:21:22,241
They restored the 2nd floor for tourists.

551
00:21:22,241 --> 00:21:24,641
And the rest of it is still unfinished.

552
00:21:24,641 --> 00:21:25,807
So cool.

553
00:21:28,307 --> 00:21:30,607
They didn't bother finishing this area.

554
00:21:31,574 --> 00:21:33,341
It's a shame.

555
00:21:35,741 --> 00:21:38,341
He never came back to this castle again.

556
00:21:38,341 --> 00:21:39,607
- Boldt? / - Yes.

557
00:21:39,607 --> 00:21:41,807
I passed by it before but never went inside.

558
00:21:41,807 --> 00:21:42,674
They have a pool too?

559
00:21:42,674 --> 00:21:43,807
Yes, there's a pool.

560
00:21:43,807 --> 00:21:44,774
It says there's a pool.

561
00:21:44,774 --> 00:21:46,207
They have everything.

562
00:21:47,341 --> 00:21:48,874
Here it is.

563
00:21:48,874 --> 00:21:51,507
They made this area into a pool.

564
00:21:51,507 --> 00:21:52,941
Hey, a toad.

565
00:21:52,941 --> 00:21:54,507
There's money on it.

566
00:21:54,507 --> 00:21:56,074
I'll give you a coin. Give it a shot.

567
00:21:56,074 --> 00:21:57,741
I'm great at stuff like this!

568
00:21:57,741 --> 00:21:59,741
- Really? / - Yeah.

569
00:21:59,741 --> 00:22:01,307
Give me a few more. You never know.

570
00:22:01,307 --> 00:22:02,774
- You said you could do it in one try. / - Give me.

571
00:22:04,007 --> 00:22:05,574
Throw it.

572
00:22:05,574 --> 00:22:07,207
Oh, come on!

573
00:22:07,207 --> 00:22:08,607
Throw it.

574
00:22:08,607 --> 00:22:09,774
Oh, come on!

575
00:22:10,774 --> 00:22:11,641
That isn't easy.

576
00:22:11,641 --> 00:22:12,974
We spent a lot of money here.

577
00:22:12,974 --> 00:22:15,007
Come on! Geez...

578
00:22:16,641 --> 00:22:17,207
Come on!

579
00:22:17,207 --> 00:22:19,174
- I'm getting the hang of it. / - Hey.

580
00:22:19,174 --> 00:22:21,574
We definitely spent a few bucks there.

581
00:22:21,574 --> 00:22:22,707
That isn't easy.

582
00:22:22,707 --> 00:22:23,374
Coins.

583
00:22:23,374 --> 00:22:24,607
One coin please.

584
00:22:24,607 --> 00:22:25,507
This is making me mad.

585
00:22:25,507 --> 00:22:26,674
He even used my money.

586
00:22:26,674 --> 00:22:28,341
(His final effort)

587
00:22:28,341 --> 00:22:29,341
Last one.

588
00:22:30,774 --> 00:22:31,674
Good luck for Hongki!

589
00:22:31,674 --> 00:22:32,941
He might end up swimming in there.

590
00:22:35,641 --> 00:22:36,341
Did he get it?

591
00:22:36,741 --> 00:22:37,507
Did he get it?

592
00:22:42,507 --> 00:22:43,407
It bounced out.

593
00:22:43,407 --> 00:22:44,541
I guess that's a no for Hongki.

594
00:22:45,274 --> 00:22:46,141
It fell in.

595
00:22:46,141 --> 00:22:47,041
Move. Let me try.

596
00:22:48,674 --> 00:22:50,374
I think she'll get it.

597
00:22:50,374 --> 00:22:51,741
Is it that hard?

598
00:22:51,741 --> 00:22:53,441
Toss it a bit far.

599
00:22:53,441 --> 00:22:54,674
Good luck for Hongki.

600
00:22:54,674 --> 00:22:55,674
Good luck for Hyorim.

601
00:22:57,041 --> 00:22:58,474
Good luck for Hongki.

602
00:22:58,474 --> 00:22:59,441
Good luck for Hyorim.

603
00:23:00,507 --> 00:23:02,074
- In one try? / - I think she'll get it.

604
00:23:02,074 --> 00:23:02,941
No way.

605
00:23:10,507 --> 00:23:12,074
Unbelievable.

606
00:23:12,541 --> 00:23:13,641
How does that make Hongki look?

607
00:23:13,641 --> 00:23:14,741
She made Hongki look silly.

608
00:23:14,741 --> 00:23:15,841
She did it in one try.

609
00:23:15,841 --> 00:23:17,574
I didn't expect that either.

610
00:23:17,574 --> 00:23:20,374
(In one try)

611
00:23:20,374 --> 00:23:22,441
Looks like I'll have good luck!

612
00:23:23,874 --> 00:23:24,941
I'm so happy.

613
00:23:27,641 --> 00:23:28,541
Look at Hongki!

614
00:23:29,574 --> 00:23:30,774
How embarrassing!

615
00:23:31,774 --> 00:23:33,141
Look at Hongki!

616
00:23:33,141 --> 00:23:35,174
You know what's good though?

617
00:23:35,174 --> 00:23:37,641
I wished myself luck too before she threw it.

618
00:23:38,374 --> 00:23:39,641
- But I threw it. / - Thanks.

619
00:23:42,007 --> 00:23:43,274
How did that happen?

620
00:23:44,641 --> 00:23:46,707
I'm so happy!

621
00:23:48,774 --> 00:23:49,674
It's a good thing that

622
00:23:49,674 --> 00:23:51,674
I said my name too before you threw it.

623
00:23:51,674 --> 00:23:52,841
Don't include yourself.

624
00:23:52,841 --> 00:23:54,007
I'm not.

625
00:23:54,007 --> 00:23:55,907
Fine, we'll both have good luck.

626
00:23:55,907 --> 00:23:56,941
- Yeah. / - Yeah.

627
00:23:58,074 --> 00:24:00,841
As soon as my coin landed...

628
00:24:00,841 --> 00:24:02,607
I became the queen of weather.

629
00:24:02,607 --> 00:24:04,374
I still can't believe it.

630
00:24:04,374 --> 00:24:06,707
I'm really lucky when it comes to weather.

631
00:24:09,941 --> 00:24:11,941
So pretty!

632
00:24:11,941 --> 00:24:13,941
- We should take a photo here. / - Yeah.

633
00:24:13,941 --> 00:24:14,641
I'll take one.

634
00:24:16,041 --> 00:24:18,207
1, 2, 3.

635
00:24:19,974 --> 00:24:22,174
(Beautiful Boldt Castle)

636
00:24:22,174 --> 00:24:24,407
(Goofy poses)

637
00:24:24,407 --> 00:24:25,807
(The realistic siblings)

638
00:24:25,807 --> 00:24:26,574
A couple shot.

639
00:24:29,741 --> 00:24:30,741
Shall we stop at the gift shop?

640
00:24:30,741 --> 00:24:32,041
Shall we?

641
00:24:32,041 --> 00:24:34,274
All he looks at are cups.

642
00:24:34,274 --> 00:24:36,507
He's obsessed with cups.

643
00:24:36,507 --> 00:24:38,441
All he looks at are cups.

644
00:24:38,441 --> 00:24:39,474
Isn't this one nice?

645
00:24:39,474 --> 00:24:40,541
I'm moving house soon.

646
00:24:40,541 --> 00:24:42,941
He bought a lot of cups.

647
00:24:43,807 --> 00:24:45,874
Buy one as a souvenir.

648
00:24:45,874 --> 00:24:47,374
They had so many pretty ones.

649
00:24:47,374 --> 00:24:49,574
(Boldt Castle has a lot of nice souvenirs)

650
00:24:49,574 --> 00:24:52,874
The cups all said Canada on them yesterday.

651
00:24:52,874 --> 00:24:54,407
But here, they all say Boldt Castle.

652
00:24:54,407 --> 00:24:56,041
Or New York.

653
00:24:56,041 --> 00:24:57,674
Since you're in the U.S.

654
00:24:57,674 --> 00:24:59,307
(I only have eyes for you)

655
00:24:59,307 --> 00:25:00,007
A beer mug?

656
00:25:01,074 --> 00:25:02,741
He seems the happiest when buying stuff.

657
00:25:03,974 --> 00:25:05,707
I bought a few as gifts.

658
00:25:05,707 --> 00:25:07,141
- As gifts. / - Yes.

659
00:25:08,341 --> 00:25:09,474
Refrigerator magnets.

660
00:25:09,474 --> 00:25:11,307
I collect those.

661
00:25:11,307 --> 00:25:12,841
And international post cards.

662
00:25:12,841 --> 00:25:15,474
Or if I go to museums,

663
00:25:15,474 --> 00:25:17,141
I usually get a post card

664
00:25:17,141 --> 00:25:19,574
of the most memorable painting.

665
00:25:19,574 --> 00:25:20,941
Since you can't buy the painting.

666
00:25:20,941 --> 00:25:22,141
So I always buy post cards.

667
00:25:22,141 --> 00:25:23,807
I have a big stack at home.

668
00:25:24,574 --> 00:25:25,541
This one's the best.

669
00:25:25,541 --> 00:25:27,607
You can see the heart-shaped island.

670
00:25:27,607 --> 00:25:29,674
(She picks a post card of Heart Island)

671
00:25:29,674 --> 00:25:30,674
Heart-shaped.

672
00:25:32,207 --> 00:25:34,474
When would we ever go to Boldt Castle.

673
00:25:34,474 --> 00:25:36,041
Right.

674
00:25:36,707 --> 00:25:40,107
(Bye, Heart Island)

675
00:25:41,374 --> 00:25:42,074
Let's go!

676
00:25:42,074 --> 00:25:45,707
(They head back to Niagara Falls)

677
00:25:47,741 --> 00:25:49,074
- You're going back? / - Yes.

678
00:25:49,074 --> 00:25:50,607
For 4 hours?

679
00:25:50,607 --> 00:25:53,474
On the way back, the trip will seem shorter.

680
00:25:53,474 --> 00:25:55,107
That's true.

681
00:25:55,107 --> 00:25:56,974
- We were talking the entire way. / - Right.

682
00:25:56,974 --> 00:25:57,574
Time really flew by.

683
00:25:57,574 --> 00:25:59,974
I'd drive for 4 hours to go see that.

684
00:25:59,974 --> 00:26:01,474
- Right. / - It's worth going to.

685
00:26:01,474 --> 00:26:03,307
- I'd go there. / - You have to go.

686
00:26:06,541 --> 00:26:09,274
(It's day 5 of their trip in Canada)

687
00:26:11,241 --> 00:26:14,874
(The sun is still warm)

688
00:26:14,874 --> 00:26:19,141
(And Niagara Falls still looks amazing)

689
00:26:21,507 --> 00:26:23,241
(The current time is 8 a.m.)

690
00:26:23,241 --> 00:26:24,541
Now where to?

691
00:26:24,541 --> 00:26:26,541
We're going to a market.

692
00:26:26,541 --> 00:26:30,041
It's Canada's biggest and oldest market.

693
00:26:30,041 --> 00:26:32,407
We'll get some food...

694
00:26:32,407 --> 00:26:34,041
Allow me to escort you!

695
00:26:34,041 --> 00:26:35,241
Of course.

696
00:26:35,241 --> 00:26:36,407
He's in a good mood again.

697
00:26:36,407 --> 00:26:37,307
Drive!

698
00:26:37,841 --> 00:26:39,307
- My goodness! / - Drive.

699
00:26:40,141 --> 00:26:42,141
Oh, boy! Goodness!

700
00:26:42,141 --> 00:26:44,274
Let's put on our seat belts.

701
00:26:44,274 --> 00:26:47,141
- Let's go! / - Let's go!

702
00:26:48,141 --> 00:26:49,541
(Glances)

703
00:26:49,541 --> 00:26:51,874
We should've rented a supercar like those.

704
00:26:51,874 --> 00:26:54,041
Are they for rent?

705
00:26:54,041 --> 00:26:55,341
This is a supercar too.

706
00:26:56,441 --> 00:26:57,507
Since we're going to a super market.

707
00:26:58,707 --> 00:27:00,207
If you drive to the super market, it's a supercar.

708
00:27:01,074 --> 00:27:02,874
They have the same sense of humor.

709
00:27:03,541 --> 00:27:04,507
Supercar...

710
00:27:04,507 --> 00:27:05,641
Oh, my God!

711
00:27:05,641 --> 00:27:07,274
(Farmers' market)

712
00:27:07,274 --> 00:27:09,341
- You're going to a market now? / - Yes.

713
00:27:09,341 --> 00:27:12,707
Is it open every day like a super market?

714
00:27:12,707 --> 00:27:14,041
No, it's not like that.

715
00:27:14,041 --> 00:27:15,907
It's only open on Thursdays and Saturdays.

716
00:27:15,907 --> 00:27:18,574
And it starts at 7 a.m. and closes at 3 p.m.

717
00:27:18,574 --> 00:27:19,674
- It closes early. / - Yes.

718
00:27:19,674 --> 00:27:22,074
- It closes at 3 p.m.? / - That's what made it tough.

719
00:27:22,074 --> 00:27:25,107
It all closes so early, so we had to wake up early.

720
00:27:25,107 --> 00:27:26,474
- Since it opens early. / - Yes.

721
00:27:27,974 --> 00:27:31,907
(The market is an hour and 40 minutes away)

722
00:27:32,774 --> 00:27:34,141
We're here!

723
00:27:34,141 --> 00:27:35,341
Is this it?

724
00:27:35,341 --> 00:27:36,441
That way.

725
00:27:38,241 --> 00:27:43,074
All the specialties that can be found in this area...

726
00:27:43,074 --> 00:27:46,007
It's a huge market that sells all that.

727
00:27:46,007 --> 00:27:48,707
We can pick out street food...

728
00:27:48,707 --> 00:27:49,974
- And sit over there. / - Whenever I travel...

729
00:27:49,974 --> 00:27:52,507
- I always go to the market. / - Right.

730
00:27:52,507 --> 00:27:54,807
- It's so much fun. / - Yes.

731
00:27:54,807 --> 00:27:57,607
- This is... / - It's like Moran Market.

732
00:27:57,607 --> 00:27:58,841
It's like Moran Market.

733
00:27:58,841 --> 00:28:00,141
It is not.

734
00:28:01,241 --> 00:28:05,074
I go to markets like this often when I travel.

735
00:28:05,074 --> 00:28:07,374
I hear there's a lot of good stuff to eat.

736
00:28:07,374 --> 00:28:09,241
What's that? Clothes hangers?

737
00:28:09,241 --> 00:28:10,341
Yeah.

738
00:28:10,341 --> 00:28:11,974
And they have guitars, Hongki.

739
00:28:12,341 --> 00:28:13,841
Oh, they have stuff like this too.

740
00:28:13,841 --> 00:28:15,074
These are handmade.

741
00:28:15,074 --> 00:28:17,107
Yeah, they're all handmade.

742
00:28:17,107 --> 00:28:19,207
People made them at home and brought them.

743
00:28:19,207 --> 00:28:20,074
Right.

744
00:28:22,674 --> 00:28:25,441
- Let's get some food. I'm hungry. / - Alright.

745
00:28:25,441 --> 00:28:28,041
It's your favorite. Syrup.

746
00:28:28,041 --> 00:28:29,341
- Where? / - There.

747
00:28:29,341 --> 00:28:30,674
Where?

748
00:28:30,674 --> 00:28:32,574
I was saving that to have with meat.

749
00:28:33,107 --> 00:28:34,374
- Drink it all in one shot. / - Canadian whiskey?

750
00:28:34,374 --> 00:28:36,041
Yeah, Canadian whiskey.

751
00:28:40,907 --> 00:28:42,074
Gosh, it's sweet!

752
00:28:42,741 --> 00:28:44,707
- Whiskey for Hongki. / - I have to buy a bottle.

753
00:28:44,707 --> 00:28:47,307
- This will make a great gift. / - Maple syrup.

754
00:28:47,974 --> 00:28:49,874
Let's pick out some food first.

755
00:28:49,874 --> 00:28:52,007
Then we'll get your whiskey.

756
00:28:52,007 --> 00:28:54,974
- It's so pretty and nice in here. / - Yeah.

757
00:28:54,974 --> 00:28:56,674
There was so much good food there.

758
00:28:56,674 --> 00:28:59,874
(Food that you can see in any other countries)

759
00:28:59,874 --> 00:29:00,774
Pizza.

760
00:29:01,774 --> 00:29:06,041
(As well as unique dishes you've never heard of)

761
00:29:08,407 --> 00:29:10,607
- I'm hungry. / - Let's pick what we want to eat.

762
00:29:11,207 --> 00:29:12,574
So much food.

763
00:29:13,807 --> 00:29:16,607
- Look at those sausages. / - Should I get chicken?

764
00:29:16,607 --> 00:29:18,607
- Chicken? / - Yeah

765
00:29:18,607 --> 00:29:19,607
How's that sound?

766
00:29:20,574 --> 00:29:22,341
You get what you want.

767
00:29:22,341 --> 00:29:25,074
- I'm getting chicken. / - Alright.

768
00:29:25,741 --> 00:29:26,974
It's chicken.

769
00:29:26,974 --> 00:29:28,674
Is it not?

770
00:29:30,874 --> 00:29:32,374
Fried apples.

771
00:29:32,374 --> 00:29:34,374
(Fried apples!)

772
00:29:34,374 --> 00:29:36,241
That's really famous.

773
00:29:36,241 --> 00:29:37,174
- They fry apples? / - What is that?

774
00:29:37,174 --> 00:29:39,807
- And it's eaten with ice cream. / - This is a first.

775
00:29:39,807 --> 00:29:41,674
It's so delicious.

776
00:29:41,674 --> 00:29:43,541
I kept thinking of it when I got back to Korea.

777
00:29:48,207 --> 00:29:51,574
(Apple fritter with ice cream, $5.40)

778
00:29:52,307 --> 00:29:54,774
I want that for dessert.

779
00:29:54,774 --> 00:29:56,507
I'll go get something else.

780
00:29:56,507 --> 00:29:58,074
- We split up. / - Stay here.

781
00:29:59,474 --> 00:30:00,741
She went to get that apple fritter

782
00:30:00,741 --> 00:30:01,841
and he went for chicken.

783
00:30:03,374 --> 00:30:06,141
- There has to be chicken in that big place. / - Yes.

784
00:30:06,141 --> 00:30:08,574
Why isn't there any chicken?

785
00:30:09,774 --> 00:30:11,707
I don't see what I want to buy.

786
00:30:11,707 --> 00:30:13,274
He really likes chicken.

787
00:30:14,674 --> 00:30:16,141
Man, I'm hungry.

788
00:30:16,741 --> 00:30:20,041
(Staring)

789
00:30:21,374 --> 00:30:22,241
Oh, that's chicken.

790
00:30:23,574 --> 00:30:25,574
(And there are two different kinds)

791
00:30:26,107 --> 00:30:27,241
Spicy chicken.

792
00:30:28,741 --> 00:30:31,707
(Fried chicken and two sides!)

793
00:30:32,907 --> 00:30:36,041
(He does a happy chicken dance)

794
00:30:36,207 --> 00:30:39,341
(Pleased)

795
00:30:40,374 --> 00:30:43,007
(He successfully gets some chicken)

796
00:30:43,007 --> 00:30:44,041
Another mood swing.

797
00:30:44,041 --> 00:30:45,041
There he goes again.

798
00:30:45,041 --> 00:30:46,974
- He's happy again. / - He's happy again.

799
00:30:48,274 --> 00:30:49,607
One dozen please.

800
00:30:51,241 --> 00:30:52,574
- How cute! / - Donuts.

801
00:30:53,341 --> 00:30:54,607
- And I got pizza. / - That pizza looks good.

802
00:30:54,607 --> 00:30:55,741
The pizza was delicious.

803
00:30:57,541 --> 00:30:59,641
(Huh? Why flowers?)

804
00:30:59,641 --> 00:31:01,374
I got flowers!

805
00:31:02,174 --> 00:31:03,441
- You can't bring that back. / - Did you eat them?

806
00:31:03,441 --> 00:31:05,907
No, when you stay in the hotel...

807
00:31:05,907 --> 00:31:07,341
- The scent? / - If you have flowers...

808
00:31:07,341 --> 00:31:09,941
It feels like a cozy home.

809
00:31:09,941 --> 00:31:11,474
She's a romantist.

810
00:31:12,807 --> 00:31:14,941
(They have a nice brunch in the nice weather)

811
00:31:15,441 --> 00:31:16,774
- That looks so good! / - It was delicious.

812
00:31:16,774 --> 00:31:18,174
I want to try that.

813
00:31:19,207 --> 00:31:21,207
I found the chicken.

814
00:31:22,007 --> 00:31:23,907
I like having a lot of different dishes.

815
00:31:23,907 --> 00:31:25,941
But we already have so much food.

816
00:31:25,941 --> 00:31:27,274
Did I buy too much?

817
00:31:28,974 --> 00:31:30,207
All I bought was one thing.

818
00:31:30,207 --> 00:31:31,041
Gosh...

819
00:31:31,041 --> 00:31:32,774
She bought way too much food.

820
00:31:32,774 --> 00:31:34,341
- You have to taste each one. / - No.

821
00:31:34,341 --> 00:31:35,541
- Right. / - You did a good job.

822
00:31:35,541 --> 00:31:37,774
You want to try a bunch of stuff.

823
00:31:37,774 --> 00:31:38,707
You have to taste everything.

824
00:31:38,707 --> 00:31:39,541
Sure!

825
00:31:39,541 --> 00:31:40,507
Hongki's getting yelled at.

826
00:31:43,541 --> 00:31:47,107
(Chicken noodles and rice, $6.70)

827
00:31:48,307 --> 00:31:50,607
(The familiar smell of chicken)

828
00:31:50,607 --> 00:31:52,341
This is a great idea.

829
00:31:52,341 --> 00:31:54,641
These 3 dishes come with rice.

830
00:31:56,674 --> 00:31:59,374
From before...

831
00:31:59,374 --> 00:32:00,974
Look how much he's eating.

832
00:32:00,974 --> 00:32:01,907
He likes it.

833
00:32:01,907 --> 00:32:03,974
(Chicken has never let him down)

834
00:32:03,974 --> 00:32:05,241
You have to try this.

835
00:32:05,241 --> 00:32:06,641
- This is... / - It's Thai food.

836
00:32:06,641 --> 00:32:08,641
It's not Thai. It's Chinese.

837
00:32:08,641 --> 00:32:10,341
It's kind of like Chinese food.

838
00:32:10,341 --> 00:32:12,074
- Chinese food in Canada? / - Right.

839
00:32:13,074 --> 00:32:14,074
It's perfect!

840
00:32:14,074 --> 00:32:15,807
(Perfect for his immature taste buds)

841
00:32:16,274 --> 00:32:19,207
- I found this for you. / - Smoked chicken.

842
00:32:19,207 --> 00:32:21,907
(Hyorim bought some chicken for picky Hongki)

843
00:32:23,241 --> 00:32:24,774
- That looks good. / - That's the real deal...

844
00:32:24,774 --> 00:32:26,774
- That's what you should've gotten. / - Looks great.

845
00:32:28,407 --> 00:32:30,174
(Smoked chicken)

846
00:32:31,341 --> 00:32:33,907
They asked how spicy I want it.

847
00:32:33,907 --> 00:32:35,407
I bet that's delicious.

848
00:32:35,407 --> 00:32:36,374
I bet it is.

849
00:32:41,574 --> 00:32:43,407
- This is good. / - The sauce is really good.

850
00:32:43,407 --> 00:32:45,207
The sauce has some heat to it.

851
00:32:45,207 --> 00:32:47,941
It's something I've never tried in Korea.

852
00:32:47,941 --> 00:32:48,841
- This? / - Yeah.

853
00:32:48,841 --> 00:32:50,541
BBQ Chicken has this flavor!

854
00:32:50,541 --> 00:32:51,341
No, it's a bit different.

855
00:32:51,341 --> 00:32:53,141
The spicy smoked chicken from BBQ Chicken

856
00:32:53,141 --> 00:32:54,641
tastes just like this.

857
00:32:56,407 --> 00:32:58,641
He hates losing arguments.

858
00:32:58,641 --> 00:33:00,207
He hates losing arguments.

859
00:33:00,207 --> 00:33:01,807
They serve their drumsticks like this?

860
00:33:01,807 --> 00:33:03,574
- Yeah, just like this. / - Not the fried kind?

861
00:33:03,574 --> 00:33:04,641
They have smog chicken too.

862
00:33:04,641 --> 00:33:05,774
Oh, really?

863
00:33:05,774 --> 00:33:07,574
This is smog chicken.

864
00:33:07,574 --> 00:33:08,441
Smoked.

865
00:33:09,741 --> 00:33:11,741
It's smoked. Not smog.

866
00:33:11,741 --> 00:33:14,474
- Smog is something different. / - Right.

867
00:33:14,474 --> 00:33:15,707
This is really famous.

868
00:33:15,707 --> 00:33:18,341
- The line was really long. / - Yeah, I saw.

869
00:33:18,641 --> 00:33:19,807
It's a fried apple,

870
00:33:19,807 --> 00:33:21,207
drizzled with maple syrup.

871
00:33:21,207 --> 00:33:22,507
That's a fried apple?

872
00:33:22,507 --> 00:33:23,907
- I want to try that! / - I want to try that too.

873
00:33:23,907 --> 00:33:25,374
- I want that. / - With some ice cream.

874
00:33:25,374 --> 00:33:26,707
- I really want to try that. / - The fried apple...

875
00:33:26,707 --> 00:33:29,574
That was a great combination.

876
00:33:29,574 --> 00:33:31,841
- That looks so good. / - It was delicious...

877
00:33:31,841 --> 00:33:33,674
- That I ate another one. / - That looks great.

878
00:33:33,674 --> 00:33:35,074
- It's kind of unique. / - Yeah.

879
00:33:35,074 --> 00:33:36,207
I've never seen this before.

880
00:33:38,041 --> 00:33:40,041
Gosh, I think it'll be too sweet.

881
00:33:40,041 --> 00:33:41,574
I love sweets.

882
00:33:48,841 --> 00:33:49,474
It's not that sweet.

883
00:33:49,474 --> 00:33:51,807
- Not as sweet as it looks. / - It's really crispy too.

884
00:33:52,441 --> 00:33:53,974
(I'm not a big fan)

885
00:33:53,974 --> 00:33:57,641
The ice cream and maple syrup are sweet...

886
00:33:58,474 --> 00:34:02,174
But the apple inside tastes fresh.

887
00:34:02,174 --> 00:34:04,841
Totally different from an apple pie.

888
00:34:08,907 --> 00:34:10,441
(So, Hyorim)

889
00:34:10,441 --> 00:34:11,807
Isn't that dessert though?

890
00:34:11,807 --> 00:34:13,374
I don't care about that stuff.

891
00:34:13,374 --> 00:34:14,607
I'll eat everything.

892
00:34:15,041 --> 00:34:16,574
- I bet it's good. / - I don't understand that either.

893
00:34:17,707 --> 00:34:19,507
This is how I am.

894
00:34:19,507 --> 00:34:21,274
I have trouble understanding

895
00:34:21,274 --> 00:34:22,441
unimaginable combinations.

896
00:34:22,441 --> 00:34:24,974
That's why I'm not too big on sushi.

897
00:34:24,974 --> 00:34:26,507
- What? / - Why not?

898
00:34:26,507 --> 00:34:27,574
Really?

899
00:34:27,574 --> 00:34:29,574
I love eating just raw fish,

900
00:34:29,574 --> 00:34:32,341
but when you combine that with rice...

901
00:34:32,341 --> 00:34:34,007
I just don't understand that union.

902
00:34:34,007 --> 00:34:35,474
Just like that, I don't understand this union.

903
00:34:37,341 --> 00:34:38,674
The apple has been fried

904
00:34:38,674 --> 00:34:41,974
and you're eating it with ice cream.

905
00:34:41,974 --> 00:34:44,107
I don't get why Hongki doesn't like that stuff.

906
00:34:45,007 --> 00:34:46,707
There's nothing I can't eat.

907
00:34:46,707 --> 00:34:48,774
You two seem like siblings.

908
00:34:48,774 --> 00:34:50,307
What are we doing after we eat?

909
00:34:50,307 --> 00:34:52,707
Something you'll like.

910
00:34:52,707 --> 00:34:53,941
We're going to a winery.

911
00:34:53,941 --> 00:34:57,274
Canada is known for icewine.

912
00:34:57,274 --> 00:34:58,207
I shouldn't get drunk on TV.

913
00:35:00,141 --> 00:35:02,474
- Let's go! / - Let's go!

914
00:35:02,474 --> 00:35:03,607
You can do wine tasting there.

915
00:35:03,607 --> 00:35:04,641
- Right. / - Yes, you can.

916
00:35:04,641 --> 00:35:08,774
(An hour and 40 minutes back to Niagara Falls)

917
00:35:08,774 --> 00:35:12,174
I prepared a private and special event

918
00:35:12,174 --> 00:35:13,041
just for you.

919
00:35:13,041 --> 00:35:16,741
We're not just going on the Niagara tour.

920
00:35:16,741 --> 00:35:18,407
If you spend a bit more...

921
00:35:18,407 --> 00:35:20,907
This is a tour that even locals don't know about.

922
00:35:22,207 --> 00:35:24,207
We're going to the winery.

923
00:35:24,207 --> 00:35:26,241
Yeah.

924
00:35:26,241 --> 00:35:27,507
So to make it private...

925
00:35:27,507 --> 00:35:29,274
(What's that?)

926
00:35:29,274 --> 00:35:30,541
We're taking that helicopter?

927
00:35:30,541 --> 00:35:32,907
Yeah, we're taking a helicopter to the winery.

928
00:35:32,907 --> 00:35:35,007
We took a helicopter tour

929
00:35:35,007 --> 00:35:36,807
over Niagara Falls.

930
00:35:36,807 --> 00:35:38,274
But if you spend a bit more,

931
00:35:38,274 --> 00:35:40,774
it'll drop you off in front of the winery.

932
00:35:40,774 --> 00:35:41,907
- Really? / - Yes.

933
00:35:41,907 --> 00:35:43,074
- The helicopter? / - Yes.

934
00:35:43,074 --> 00:35:46,674
We got ourselves a private helicopter.

935
00:35:47,641 --> 00:35:50,774
The private helicopter tour costs $280 per person.

936
00:35:50,774 --> 00:35:54,707
(Starting point, Niagara Falls, winery)

937
00:35:56,941 --> 00:35:58,407
This should be fun.

938
00:35:58,407 --> 00:36:00,707
Wow, the wind...

939
00:36:00,707 --> 00:36:04,041
I've never been this close to a helicopter.

940
00:36:04,874 --> 00:36:06,007
Let's go!

941
00:36:08,374 --> 00:36:11,541
(Bet you've never taken a helicopter to a winery)

942
00:36:12,307 --> 00:36:15,207
(Wow, exciting)

943
00:36:15,974 --> 00:36:17,107
Whoa!

944
00:36:17,107 --> 00:36:17,974
Wow!

945
00:36:21,341 --> 00:36:23,541
It's not that noisy.

946
00:36:23,541 --> 00:36:24,641
You don't have to wear headsets?

947
00:36:24,641 --> 00:36:25,774
It's a new model, so it's not that loud.

948
00:36:25,774 --> 00:36:26,941
You don't have to cover your ears.

949
00:36:26,941 --> 00:36:28,774
- Yet you can hear everything. / - That's awesome.

950
00:36:28,774 --> 00:36:30,474
- So that's a nice helicopter. / - Yes.

951
00:36:30,474 --> 00:36:33,641
(Excited)

952
00:36:33,641 --> 00:36:34,807
That's really scary.

953
00:36:34,807 --> 00:36:36,041
It feels great to fly.

954
00:36:36,607 --> 00:36:37,507
(Wow)

955
00:36:37,507 --> 00:36:41,507
(To icewine)

956
00:36:45,441 --> 00:36:47,307
(They can see Niagara Falls out the window)

957
00:36:47,307 --> 00:36:49,541
Wow, amazing!

958
00:36:49,541 --> 00:36:50,974
That's so nice.

959
00:36:50,974 --> 00:36:54,307
The view from above is way different.

960
00:36:54,307 --> 00:36:55,507
Of course.

961
00:36:55,507 --> 00:36:56,741
You can take in the entire view.

962
00:36:56,741 --> 00:36:59,441
We saw it from every angle.

963
00:36:59,441 --> 00:37:01,041
Wow, that's so nice.

964
00:37:01,807 --> 00:37:04,274
Now we'll tour the falls

965
00:37:04,274 --> 00:37:06,107
and then head to the winery.

966
00:37:06,107 --> 00:37:07,507
- Oh, really? / - Yeah.

967
00:37:07,507 --> 00:37:09,041
What a special course.

968
00:37:09,041 --> 00:37:09,941
Right.

969
00:37:09,941 --> 00:37:11,641
Look, that's the U.S.

970
00:37:11,641 --> 00:37:13,907
- That's the U.S.? / - Yeah.

971
00:37:13,907 --> 00:37:17,141
(Canada, U.S.)

972
00:37:17,607 --> 00:37:21,641
- That's the U.S. / - We were in American sky.

973
00:37:22,007 --> 00:37:24,307
Look at that. That river is so windy.

974
00:37:24,307 --> 00:37:25,874
- Right? / - Yeah.

975
00:37:26,807 --> 00:37:27,607
Amazing...

976
00:37:27,607 --> 00:37:30,407
And crossing the border by bridge

977
00:37:30,407 --> 00:37:32,674
is kind of amazing to us Koreans.

978
00:37:32,674 --> 00:37:34,541
This looks amazing.

979
00:37:37,107 --> 00:37:38,174
Wow! There's the waterfall.

980
00:37:39,107 --> 00:37:42,274
(How will Niagara Falls look from the helicopter?)

981
00:37:44,574 --> 00:37:45,507
(They saw the Niagara Falls by boat last time)

982
00:37:45,507 --> 00:37:47,241
- Now you'll see it from above. / - Yes.

983
00:37:47,241 --> 00:37:49,641
We'll see it again from above.

984
00:37:50,941 --> 00:37:52,407
This is amazing.

985
00:37:52,407 --> 00:37:54,407
I can't see in front of me!

986
00:37:54,407 --> 00:37:55,374
Wow...

987
00:37:55,374 --> 00:37:56,674
So pretty.

988
00:37:58,574 --> 00:38:00,241
Gosh, this is so pretty!

989
00:38:00,241 --> 00:38:01,907
The mist...

990
00:38:01,907 --> 00:38:03,474
Wow, amazing.

991
00:38:03,474 --> 00:38:05,874
This is made naturally.

992
00:38:08,441 --> 00:38:10,507
Here we go, here we go.

993
00:38:10,507 --> 00:38:11,807
Here we go, here we go.

994
00:38:13,007 --> 00:38:15,707
(Time to enjoy the view of Niagara Falls from the sky)

995
00:38:15,707 --> 00:38:17,241
Now from the sky.

996
00:38:19,441 --> 00:38:20,574
What a sight.

997
00:38:20,574 --> 00:38:21,807
It was like a painting.

998
00:38:21,807 --> 00:38:22,807
An amazing sight.

999
00:38:29,307 --> 00:38:30,474
Isn't that the U.S.?

1000
00:38:30,474 --> 00:38:32,241
Yes, that's Bridal Falls.

1001
00:38:33,307 --> 00:38:34,307
And that's Canada.

1002
00:38:34,307 --> 00:38:36,141
Canada's waterfall is bigger.

1003
00:38:36,141 --> 00:38:38,274
- And the shape is pretty too. / - You're right.

1004
00:38:42,007 --> 00:38:46,274
(Her heart races at the new sights)

1005
00:38:46,274 --> 00:38:50,907
(He makes a big deal over nothing)

1006
00:38:50,907 --> 00:38:55,541
(As we whistle over Niagara Falls)

1007
00:39:02,341 --> 00:39:04,741
It's so different seeing it from above.

1008
00:39:04,741 --> 00:39:07,407
The river flows down there.

1009
00:39:08,541 --> 00:39:11,541
That's right before the waterfall.

1010
00:39:11,541 --> 00:39:13,641
Wow, amazing!

1011
00:39:17,907 --> 00:39:24,874
(They fly towards the endless flowing water)

1012
00:39:32,374 --> 00:39:34,574
Hey, we were on that boat last time.

1013
00:39:36,407 --> 00:39:40,274
Everything I look at is so refreshing! This is great.

1014
00:39:41,974 --> 00:39:43,374
This is great, Hyorim.

1015
00:39:43,374 --> 00:39:44,374
- Right? / - Yeah.

1016
00:39:44,374 --> 00:39:46,507
- Now he finally admits it. / - For the first time.

1017
00:39:47,341 --> 00:39:50,441
Now we're going to the winery.

1018
00:39:50,441 --> 00:39:52,274
You take the tour and go right to the winery?

1019
00:39:52,274 --> 00:39:55,007
- It drops you off there like a taxi. / - Awesome.

1020
00:39:55,007 --> 00:39:56,974
- Such a great course. / - Like a taxi.

1021
00:39:56,974 --> 00:39:59,007
How long does it take to get to the winery?

1022
00:39:59,007 --> 00:40:02,007
- Around 20 minutes. / - 20 to 30 minutes.

1023
00:40:10,441 --> 00:40:13,407
It looks like a separate house or a farm.

1024
00:40:14,207 --> 00:40:16,707
(Where they'll get off)

1025
00:40:18,474 --> 00:40:19,941
Oh, so here it is.

1026
00:40:19,941 --> 00:40:21,441
- How do you get off? / - Where will you land?

1027
00:40:21,441 --> 00:40:22,741
I don't see anywhere to land.

1028
00:40:25,574 --> 00:40:28,074
- Just on the grass? / - Just on the grass.

1029
00:40:28,074 --> 00:40:29,241
(The helicopter landed right in front of the winery)

1030
00:40:29,241 --> 00:40:30,241
So cool.

1031
00:40:30,241 --> 00:40:32,741
Not a lot of people come by helicopter.

1032
00:40:32,741 --> 00:40:35,641
So everyone comes out of the winery to see it.

1033
00:40:36,907 --> 00:40:39,141
- It's like special treatment. / - You feel like a big shot.

1034
00:40:39,141 --> 00:40:40,541
Right.

1035
00:40:40,541 --> 00:40:42,374
I want to take a helicopter to go drinking too.

1036
00:40:42,374 --> 00:40:43,174
"What did you do yesterday?"

1037
00:40:43,174 --> 00:40:44,941
I just took a helicopter to get some wine.

1038
00:40:45,941 --> 00:40:47,841
You need a helicopter to get some wine.

1039
00:40:53,574 --> 00:40:55,174
Wow!

1040
00:40:55,174 --> 00:40:57,141
(Feeling great)

1041
00:40:57,807 --> 00:40:59,374
Wow, this is great!

1042
00:40:59,374 --> 00:41:00,441
Hongki's happy.

1043
00:41:00,441 --> 00:41:02,941
(Another person is excited)

1044
00:41:04,474 --> 00:41:05,774
Hurry up!

1045
00:41:05,774 --> 00:41:07,107
(That's enough of that)

1046
00:41:07,541 --> 00:41:09,407
Geez, you're so silly.

1047
00:41:09,407 --> 00:41:11,407
(Hahaha)

1048
00:41:11,407 --> 00:41:12,941
I love this.

1049
00:41:14,307 --> 00:41:16,374
- This is it? / - Yeah.

1050
00:41:16,941 --> 00:41:17,874
(Trip to the small cities in Canada)

1051
00:41:17,874 --> 00:41:18,907
(Icewine winery)

1052
00:41:18,907 --> 00:41:22,374
- It's a luxurious trip with the helicopter. / - Right.

1053
00:41:22,374 --> 00:41:25,007
This was unexpected.

1054
00:41:25,007 --> 00:41:26,774
(Niagara-on-the-Lake)

1055
00:41:27,574 --> 00:41:31,174
(A quiet and small city by the lake)

1056
00:41:31,174 --> 00:41:37,607
(A big vineyard near Lake Ontario)

1057
00:41:39,141 --> 00:41:43,941
(A beautiful village with nature and wine)

1058
00:41:43,941 --> 00:41:46,574
- It's real ice. / - Wow, look at that ice.

1059
00:41:46,574 --> 00:41:48,607
They have an ice room.

1060
00:41:48,607 --> 00:41:49,707
(Niagara-on-the-Lake)

1061
00:41:49,707 --> 00:41:54,541
There's a special place where you can sample wine.

1062
00:41:54,541 --> 00:41:56,707
- What is it? / - You'll see.

1063
00:41:56,707 --> 00:41:58,674
- I'll see? / - Yeah, you'll see.

1064
00:41:58,674 --> 00:41:59,941
Don't be shocked.

1065
00:41:59,941 --> 00:42:03,174
I've never been to an icewine winery like that.

1066
00:42:03,174 --> 00:42:04,607
- I'm Dylan. / - Dylan!

1067
00:42:04,607 --> 00:42:06,707
- Nice to meet you. / - Nice to meet you too.

1068
00:42:08,774 --> 00:42:11,007
- Already? / - Thank you.

1069
00:42:12,174 --> 00:42:14,974
Our Vidal Icewine infused into the bottle.

1070
00:42:19,707 --> 00:42:24,307
(He pops the cork like magic)

1071
00:42:24,307 --> 00:42:25,507
It's rose.

1072
00:42:33,007 --> 00:42:36,307
We used 100% of the grapes from Ontario.

1073
00:42:36,307 --> 00:42:37,274
Cheers.

1074
00:42:39,774 --> 00:42:41,607
It smells like champagne.

1075
00:42:44,007 --> 00:42:48,007
(Hey! Hey!)

1076
00:42:48,007 --> 00:42:50,441
- What? / - She can't stop!

1077
00:42:50,441 --> 00:42:51,207
She likes it.

1078
00:42:51,207 --> 00:42:55,041
I turn red even after one drink.

1079
00:42:55,041 --> 00:42:57,774
- So I shouldn't drink. / - Yeah, you don't drink.

1080
00:42:57,774 --> 00:42:59,774
But the wine was so good, I kept drinking.

1081
00:43:00,474 --> 00:43:02,974
(So delicious that she chugs it down)

1082
00:43:03,841 --> 00:43:05,407
You don't need a straw?

1083
00:43:05,974 --> 00:43:07,541
It's so good!

1084
00:43:07,541 --> 00:43:09,474
This is so good!

1085
00:43:09,474 --> 00:43:10,807
- This is good. / - I like it.

1086
00:43:12,507 --> 00:43:16,907
(Now it's time to tour the winery)

1087
00:43:21,407 --> 00:43:23,174
(Roses at the entrance of the vineyard)

1088
00:43:23,174 --> 00:43:24,674
Roses.

1089
00:43:24,674 --> 00:43:25,974
They're bigger than my fist.

1090
00:43:25,974 --> 00:43:27,841
There's a reason why that rose bush is there.

1091
00:43:27,841 --> 00:43:30,241
Rose bushes are really important to a vineyard.

1092
00:43:30,241 --> 00:43:31,407
- Oh... / - Because...

1093
00:43:31,407 --> 00:43:34,007
A rose is susceptible to disease

1094
00:43:34,007 --> 00:43:36,541
and insects very easily.

1095
00:43:36,541 --> 00:43:38,374
So if there's anything wrong

1096
00:43:38,374 --> 00:43:39,974
with the rose bush...

1097
00:43:39,974 --> 00:43:44,274
Questions 1 through 17 are English listening.

1098
00:43:44,274 --> 00:43:47,441
Listen carefully and answer the questions.

1099
00:43:51,107 --> 00:43:53,274
It really felt like an English exam.

1100
00:43:53,274 --> 00:43:55,907
Workers know that there's a risk to the vines

1101
00:43:55,907 --> 00:43:57,607
and can take action quickly

1102
00:43:57,607 --> 00:44:00,641
before the grapes are damaged.

1103
00:44:00,641 --> 00:44:02,741
These are pretty...

1104
00:44:02,741 --> 00:44:05,541
It's the Canadian mentality.

1105
00:44:05,541 --> 00:44:08,874
(He can't believe he just said that)

1106
00:44:08,874 --> 00:44:12,741
- The roses are weak... / - Easily.

1107
00:44:12,741 --> 00:44:14,674
But they plant roses here because

1108
00:44:14,674 --> 00:44:21,141
the roses are the first to react if there are any pests.

1109
00:44:21,141 --> 00:44:23,807
So this shows the condition of the vineyard.

1110
00:44:23,807 --> 00:44:26,274
Workers know that there’s a risk to the vines...

1111
00:44:26,274 --> 00:44:32,007
The roses are the first to react if there are any pests.

1112
00:44:33,141 --> 00:44:34,841
And can take action quickly

1113
00:44:34,841 --> 00:44:36,474
before the grapes are damaged.

1114
00:44:36,474 --> 00:44:39,874
So this shows the condition of the vineyard.

1115
00:44:39,874 --> 00:44:42,007
They look very healthy.

1116
00:44:42,007 --> 00:44:43,241
So the vineyard must be healthy too.

1117
00:44:43,241 --> 00:44:45,207
So everything here should be healthy.

1118
00:44:45,207 --> 00:44:48,241
Yeah, that's right. No pests.

1119
00:44:48,241 --> 00:44:49,274
Say it in English.

1120
00:44:50,807 --> 00:44:52,141
Let's go!

1121
00:44:54,507 --> 00:44:57,007
Don't make me speak English.

1122
00:44:57,007 --> 00:44:59,441
My mind goes blank when I try to speak English.

1123
00:45:01,941 --> 00:45:03,174
- Grape? / - Yes.

1124
00:45:04,641 --> 00:45:05,707
It's growing.

1125
00:45:05,707 --> 00:45:08,774
- Those are grapes. / - Still babies.

1126
00:45:09,307 --> 00:45:15,574
I had no idea that wine was famous in Canada

1127
00:45:15,574 --> 00:45:17,041
before I did research for this trip.

1128
00:45:17,041 --> 00:45:19,807
I heard that icewine was famous here.

1129
00:45:19,807 --> 00:45:21,041
Icewine...

1130
00:45:22,207 --> 00:45:24,307
- It looks like "Frozen." / - Right?

1131
00:45:25,674 --> 00:45:28,441
So it keeps freezing and thawing.

1132
00:45:29,674 --> 00:45:31,107
Wow, I bet it's delicious.

1133
00:45:32,141 --> 00:45:34,241
So, for icewine...

1134
00:45:34,241 --> 00:45:37,741
You drink it with ice in them like iced Americano.

1135
00:45:38,007 --> 00:45:40,641
So, is icewine cold wine?

1136
00:45:40,641 --> 00:45:42,874
No, it's not like that.

1137
00:45:42,874 --> 00:45:46,707
Icewine can be drank cold.

1138
00:45:46,707 --> 00:45:49,774
But the best temperature is 7 to 8 degrees.

1139
00:45:49,774 --> 00:45:52,707
- So that it's chilled. / - Chilled.

1140
00:45:53,441 --> 00:45:55,141
All these barrels are filled with wine?

1141
00:45:55,141 --> 00:45:57,774
A little wine in here?

1142
00:45:57,774 --> 00:46:02,907
Actually, the equivalent of 300 bottles of wine in each.

1143
00:46:07,141 --> 00:46:10,674
Wow, there is wine in these barrels.

1144
00:46:10,674 --> 00:46:12,107
We have to wear this.

1145
00:46:12,107 --> 00:46:14,574
- Isn't this a Canadian brand? / - Yeah.

1146
00:46:14,574 --> 00:46:17,741
You have to put on a coat to try the wine.

1147
00:46:18,207 --> 00:46:21,041
Is this a gift?

1148
00:46:23,607 --> 00:46:24,341
In a way.

1149
00:46:24,341 --> 00:46:26,474
Because you're going to want to be wearing that.

1150
00:46:26,474 --> 00:46:29,407
We're going into our 10 below icewine lounge.

1151
00:46:29,407 --> 00:46:31,841
And it is -10℃ in there.

1152
00:46:31,841 --> 00:46:34,007
- Ice room? / - Yeah, an ice room.

1153
00:46:34,007 --> 00:46:35,674
It's -10℃ in there.

1154
00:46:35,674 --> 00:46:37,907
You have to wear one then. Wow, this is crazy.

1155
00:46:37,907 --> 00:46:39,974
So this is why you said this was special.

1156
00:46:39,974 --> 00:46:42,774
-10℃ since it's icewine.

1157
00:46:48,307 --> 00:46:51,341
(Where will they taste icewine?)

1158
00:46:51,341 --> 00:46:54,407
Look at her face. Great reaction from both of them.

1159
00:46:54,407 --> 00:46:57,174
- I didn't want to come out. / - So nice.

1160
00:47:00,007 --> 00:47:03,307
Yeah! This is what I said was famous!

1161
00:47:03,307 --> 00:47:06,274
They're frozen in ice.

1162
00:47:07,107 --> 00:47:08,841
- They're in the ice. / - Yes.

1163
00:47:11,907 --> 00:47:12,974
Is that real ice?

1164
00:47:12,974 --> 00:47:14,774
I'm starting to sober up.

1165
00:47:16,307 --> 00:47:17,941
It's really cold.

1166
00:47:17,941 --> 00:47:21,074
(Everything is ice)

1167
00:47:21,574 --> 00:47:24,974
We carved it out of 30,000 pounds of ice.

1168
00:47:24,974 --> 00:47:27,241
We have to rebuild it about every 2 years.

1169
00:47:29,074 --> 00:47:31,174
Cold!

1170
00:47:32,274 --> 00:47:33,341
Very cold.

1171
00:47:33,341 --> 00:47:35,741
But the perfect spot to try...

1172
00:47:35,741 --> 00:47:38,674
- Our signature series Vidal Icewine. / - I like this!

1173
00:47:40,441 --> 00:47:41,341
(How would it taste?)

1174
00:47:41,341 --> 00:47:43,941
- So, because it taste sweet... / - More, more.

1175
00:47:43,941 --> 00:47:46,574
- That's the famous one, right? / - Yes.

1176
00:47:46,574 --> 00:47:47,741
More, more, more.

1177
00:47:47,741 --> 00:47:49,541
Let's start with one and go from there.

1178
00:47:50,374 --> 00:47:51,107
So...

1179
00:47:51,107 --> 00:47:52,474
- Cheers. / - When you drink this...

1180
00:47:52,474 --> 00:47:53,474
Because you taste sweetness...

1181
00:47:53,474 --> 00:47:56,607
This is what I'm talking about! I love this stuff!

1182
00:47:56,607 --> 00:47:57,941
He's excited now.

1183
00:47:57,941 --> 00:47:59,974
Hongki is finally happy after 3 episodes.

1184
00:48:03,141 --> 00:48:06,407
Don't drink it all at once. Sip it.

1185
00:48:06,974 --> 00:48:08,341
From your tongue.

1186
00:48:11,507 --> 00:48:13,707
He's good at doing what he's told.

1187
00:48:14,474 --> 00:48:15,974
He likes it.

1188
00:48:18,407 --> 00:48:20,007
That's what I'm talking about!

1189
00:48:20,641 --> 00:48:22,707
- This is it! / - You said you don't like sweets.

1190
00:48:22,707 --> 00:48:23,707
But this is wine.

1191
00:48:23,707 --> 00:48:25,107
- Is it different? / - Of course.

1192
00:48:25,107 --> 00:48:26,941
There's honey in alcohol!

1193
00:48:28,474 --> 00:48:30,641
It's not honey.

1194
00:48:30,641 --> 00:48:32,841
The grapes are just really sweet.

1195
00:48:32,841 --> 00:48:35,174
(I love wine)

1196
00:48:35,841 --> 00:48:38,007
Hongki's finally showing some reactions.

1197
00:48:38,007 --> 00:48:40,841
- Like a baby that was just fed. / - That stuff...

1198
00:48:40,841 --> 00:48:42,007
It's the best wine.

1199
00:48:42,007 --> 00:48:45,341
The sweetness differs depending on the vintage.

1200
00:48:45,341 --> 00:48:47,841
The one on the wall over there.

1201
00:48:47,841 --> 00:48:50,841
During winter 2013, it was so cold

1202
00:48:50,841 --> 00:48:55,107
that we measured the highest possible sugar content

1203
00:48:55,107 --> 00:48:55,807
in grapes.

1204
00:48:55,807 --> 00:48:58,074
From 2013?

1205
00:48:58,074 --> 00:49:01,141
They were able to make 1,500 bottles.

1206
00:49:01,141 --> 00:49:05,041
- It's incredible... / - It must be really expensive.

1207
00:49:05,041 --> 00:49:07,207
It's very difficult to turn it into wine.

1208
00:49:07,207 --> 00:49:10,374
(Limited edition icewine)

1209
00:49:10,374 --> 00:49:12,607
- 1,500 bottles. / - You can try that too?

1210
00:49:12,607 --> 00:49:14,407
- Limited edition. / - No, not that one.

1211
00:49:14,407 --> 00:49:15,607
You have to buy a bottle.

1212
00:49:15,607 --> 00:49:18,041
- Can I buy? / - Yes.

1213
00:49:18,041 --> 00:49:19,241
- How much? How much? / - Really?

1214
00:49:19,241 --> 00:49:20,574
$500.

1215
00:49:20,574 --> 00:49:25,907
- Around $500. / - $500? Are you serious?

1216
00:49:25,907 --> 00:49:29,207
If they sold that in Korea, they'd charge like $1,000.

1217
00:49:29,207 --> 00:49:30,374
Of course.

1218
00:49:31,407 --> 00:49:32,507
It's good.

1219
00:49:33,074 --> 00:49:34,607
It's really good.

1220
00:49:35,474 --> 00:49:37,107
(He has another glass)

1221
00:49:37,107 --> 00:49:38,541
Thank you.

1222
00:49:41,974 --> 00:49:43,874
Man, it's cold.

1223
00:49:46,141 --> 00:49:48,141
- This is so nice. / - Let's get out of here.

1224
00:49:48,141 --> 00:49:50,274
Just wait. Let me taste my wine.

1225
00:49:50,274 --> 00:49:51,507
Then I'm leaving first.

1226
00:49:52,407 --> 00:49:53,507
It's cold!

1227
00:49:54,174 --> 00:49:56,907
- I can't take this anymore. / - He's not happy anymore.

1228
00:49:56,907 --> 00:49:59,641
Fine, I'll join you after I finish mine.

1229
00:49:59,641 --> 00:50:02,841
- You should keep drinking. / - You should've waited!

1230
00:50:02,841 --> 00:50:05,707
- No, it was nice and quiet. / - He should've stayed.

1231
00:50:05,707 --> 00:50:07,774
It was nice to get some alone time.

1232
00:50:07,774 --> 00:50:11,174
It's so nice and quiet without Hongki.

1233
00:50:14,141 --> 00:50:16,007
My gosh, it's raining.

1234
00:50:16,007 --> 00:50:17,774
See? I told you so.

1235
00:50:17,774 --> 00:50:20,674
- Call a cab. / - Yeah, we should.

1236
00:50:20,674 --> 00:50:22,507
Old Town...

1237
00:50:22,507 --> 00:50:24,074
Done.

1238
00:50:26,274 --> 00:50:27,441
Hello.

1239
00:50:32,507 --> 00:50:35,241
(Going to downtown Niagara-on-the-Lake)

1240
00:50:38,974 --> 00:50:43,441
(It looks like old England)

1241
00:50:43,441 --> 00:50:44,907
So pretty.

1242
00:50:45,474 --> 00:50:46,874
Where is this place?

1243
00:50:46,874 --> 00:50:50,307
This is Niagara-on-the-Lake.

1244
00:50:50,307 --> 00:50:53,974
- It was the former capital of Canada. / - It was?

1245
00:50:53,974 --> 00:50:55,474
If you go there,

1246
00:50:55,474 --> 00:50:57,407
you can experience Canada and Europe.

1247
00:50:57,407 --> 00:50:58,607
You can experience the UK.

1248
00:50:58,607 --> 00:51:01,007
- And you can go to the U.S. / - That's great.

1249
00:51:01,841 --> 00:51:04,707
(Very European due to British colonization)

1250
00:51:04,707 --> 00:51:07,741
There are many British-style buildings here.

1251
00:51:07,741 --> 00:51:10,107
I heard this hotel is really famous.

1252
00:51:10,107 --> 00:51:11,841
(They see an old hotel along the path)

1253
00:51:11,841 --> 00:51:13,441
- That's a hotel? / - Yes.

1254
00:51:13,441 --> 00:51:18,641
Queen Elizabeth II visited here during Victorian era.

1255
00:51:18,641 --> 00:51:21,341
Let's check out this pretty hotel.

1256
00:51:21,341 --> 00:51:23,741
(Victorian style interior from 18th century England)

1257
00:51:26,074 --> 00:51:28,174
Very antique looking.

1258
00:51:28,174 --> 00:51:30,407
It's really like England.

1259
00:51:32,974 --> 00:51:35,041
I feel like I'm in England.

1260
00:51:37,274 --> 00:51:40,574
(They'll enjoy some afternoon tea)

1261
00:51:40,574 --> 00:51:43,341
I went to London recently.

1262
00:51:43,341 --> 00:51:46,241
This is kind of like that.

1263
00:51:46,241 --> 00:51:48,541
This place... Is so...

1264
00:51:48,541 --> 00:51:51,007
I feel like we shouldn't be noisy here.

1265
00:51:51,007 --> 00:51:53,741
I feel like we have to sit here quietly.

1266
00:51:53,741 --> 00:51:58,007
In the UK, they have afternoon tea

1267
00:51:58,007 --> 00:52:00,207
for 3 hours after their meal.

1268
00:52:00,207 --> 00:52:02,874
I first learned about afternoon tea here.

1269
00:52:02,874 --> 00:52:04,574
- What? / - Afternoon tea.

1270
00:52:04,574 --> 00:52:06,307
Afternoon tea...

1271
00:52:06,307 --> 00:52:10,074
- Is very old tea drinking custom in England. / - Right.

1272
00:52:10,074 --> 00:52:12,874
Korea is too used to doing everything fast.

1273
00:52:12,874 --> 00:52:13,741
So we eat and go...

1274
00:52:13,741 --> 00:52:15,007
- But they take their time abroad. / - Right.

1275
00:52:15,007 --> 00:52:18,274
They chat for 2 hours. So they keep giving you tea.

1276
00:52:18,274 --> 00:52:21,007
- You get tea refills. / - Like pouring you booze.

1277
00:52:21,007 --> 00:52:23,374
The teapot is this big.

1278
00:52:27,141 --> 00:52:31,407
(Relaxing on a lazy afternoon with a cup of tea)

1279
00:52:31,407 --> 00:52:34,507
You drink that tea after lunch...

1280
00:52:34,507 --> 00:52:36,541
- And drink slowly for 3 hours... / - Look at that.

1281
00:52:36,541 --> 00:52:38,007
As you talk and enjoy yourselves.

1282
00:52:38,007 --> 00:52:40,307
- With scones. / - Scones.

1283
00:52:40,307 --> 00:52:42,107
Gosh, look at that.

1284
00:52:42,107 --> 00:52:43,807
(The food is a treat for the eyes)

1285
00:52:45,374 --> 00:52:49,374
They do it just like they do in England...

1286
00:52:49,374 --> 00:52:52,107
- Because of British colonization. / - Eating all of that?

1287
00:52:52,107 --> 00:52:53,841
- All 3 tiers? / - Right.

1288
00:52:53,841 --> 00:52:55,674
- You have to eat that. / - Of course.

1289
00:52:55,674 --> 00:52:58,341
People that enjoy that practice

1290
00:52:58,341 --> 00:53:01,107
tend to eat light lunch like a salad...

1291
00:53:01,107 --> 00:53:03,207
- To save room for that. / - For that.

1292
00:53:04,841 --> 00:53:07,374
(How will afternoon tea in Canada be?)

1293
00:53:10,007 --> 00:53:13,874
This is the signature tea of this hotel.

1294
00:53:15,541 --> 00:53:18,474
Afternoon tea is usually enjoyed

1295
00:53:18,474 --> 00:53:22,074
with tea and champagne.

1296
00:53:22,074 --> 00:53:24,307
- This is black tea. / - Yeah.

1297
00:53:24,674 --> 00:53:27,041
- Look how big the teapot is. / - You're right.

1298
00:53:28,974 --> 00:53:32,241
When you first taste it, it tastes like red chili paste.

1299
00:53:32,241 --> 00:53:34,941
- Chili paste? / - It tastes like chili paste to me.

1300
00:53:34,941 --> 00:53:36,641
It does kind of smell like that.

1301
00:53:36,641 --> 00:53:38,274
It was a bit spicy.

1302
00:53:38,274 --> 00:53:39,507
Slightly spicy.

1303
00:53:39,507 --> 00:53:42,541
With afternoon tea, you start from the bottom.

1304
00:53:43,774 --> 00:53:46,141
1, 2, 3. That's the order.

1305
00:53:46,141 --> 00:53:47,341
She sounds cute when she talks,

1306
00:53:47,341 --> 00:53:48,574
but she's scary when she eats.

1307
00:53:50,407 --> 00:53:52,474
Is this apple pie?

1308
00:53:52,474 --> 00:53:54,274
No, they're also sandwiches.

1309
00:53:54,274 --> 00:53:55,941
It's a sandwich made with pie crust.

1310
00:53:55,941 --> 00:53:58,274
They don't usually do this.

1311
00:53:58,274 --> 00:53:59,941
What a devious sandwich.

1312
00:54:00,807 --> 00:54:03,641
- Why? / - It's dressed like a pie.

1313
00:54:03,641 --> 00:54:05,041
Geez...

1314
00:54:05,041 --> 00:54:07,441
Hongki loves lame dad jokes now.

1315
00:54:08,707 --> 00:54:10,507
It's dressed like a pie.

1316
00:54:11,407 --> 00:54:15,007
(She hates it)

1317
00:54:15,607 --> 00:54:17,607
This sandwich is dressed like a pie.

1318
00:54:17,607 --> 00:54:18,807
Oh, brother...

1319
00:54:18,807 --> 00:54:21,607
- Should we try some? / - Start from the bottom.

1320
00:54:21,607 --> 00:54:25,107
(Time to really enjoy their afternoon tea)

1321
00:54:25,107 --> 00:54:26,007
That sure looks good.

1322
00:54:26,007 --> 00:54:28,541
The ones on top look the best.

1323
00:54:28,541 --> 00:54:31,407
Yes, so you start with the savory ones.

1324
00:54:31,407 --> 00:54:33,107
I always have afternoon tea

1325
00:54:33,107 --> 00:54:35,007
at least twice when I travel.

1326
00:54:35,007 --> 00:54:39,174
They usually use plain bread to make sandwiches.

1327
00:54:39,174 --> 00:54:41,574
- But they used pie crusts here. / - Just this place?

1328
00:54:41,574 --> 00:54:43,807
Yeah, I've never seen this before.

1329
00:54:43,807 --> 00:54:46,874
(Nom)

1330
00:54:51,607 --> 00:54:53,007
What's this?

1331
00:54:53,807 --> 00:54:55,907
I've never tried this before.

1332
00:54:55,907 --> 00:54:56,941
- What's that inside? / - What's that filling?

1333
00:54:56,941 --> 00:54:58,607
- I see something inside. / - Cream?

1334
00:55:00,241 --> 00:55:03,841
- It's tuna... / - Tuna salad?

1335
00:55:03,841 --> 00:55:06,441
They're stuffed with tuna salad.

1336
00:55:06,441 --> 00:55:09,141
They mixed up some tuna

1337
00:55:09,141 --> 00:55:12,107
with mayo and vegetables.

1338
00:55:13,607 --> 00:55:15,041
This is good.

1339
00:55:16,707 --> 00:55:19,974
(She moves onto the next sandwich!)

1340
00:55:22,641 --> 00:55:26,341
(She really starts chowing down)

1341
00:55:26,341 --> 00:55:29,607
(Killing the first tier all by herself)

1342
00:55:29,607 --> 00:55:32,041
Do you do 1,000 push-ups in your hotel room

1343
00:55:32,041 --> 00:55:33,274
after finishing that?

1344
00:55:33,274 --> 00:55:35,207
I love bread.

1345
00:55:35,207 --> 00:55:36,541
How do you not gain weight?

1346
00:55:39,374 --> 00:55:41,907
Bread really suits me.

1347
00:55:43,407 --> 00:55:45,207
(Tier 2, scones)

1348
00:55:45,207 --> 00:55:47,107
Scones are delicious!

1349
00:55:47,107 --> 00:55:48,641
Seulgi is already on our side.

1350
00:55:49,341 --> 00:55:51,341
I'm really tempted.

1351
00:55:51,341 --> 00:55:55,074
(Tier 2, scones)

1352
00:55:55,074 --> 00:55:56,674
You can judge a place on

1353
00:55:56,674 --> 00:56:00,674
their afternoon tea by how good their scones are.

1354
00:56:00,674 --> 00:56:02,507
We can't stop eating.

1355
00:56:02,507 --> 00:56:03,774
The scones were delicious.

1356
00:56:03,774 --> 00:56:06,241
- Afternoon tea... / - Wow, that butter...

1357
00:56:06,241 --> 00:56:07,374
- Is all about scones. / - For real.

1358
00:56:07,374 --> 00:56:08,674
Scones determine whether that place

1359
00:56:08,674 --> 00:56:10,107
does good afternoon tea or not.

1360
00:56:10,107 --> 00:56:12,174
- Scones are very high in calories. / - Yes.

1361
00:56:12,174 --> 00:56:13,941
But they're so delicious.

1362
00:56:13,941 --> 00:56:16,507
- You tend to eat more with tea. / - Right.

1363
00:56:16,507 --> 00:56:19,307
- Take a bite and take a sip. / - Right.

1364
00:56:19,941 --> 00:56:21,474
(A scone with plenty of butter, jam and cream)

1365
00:56:21,474 --> 00:56:23,341
That looks good though.

1366
00:56:27,774 --> 00:56:29,341
This scone is delicious.

1367
00:56:29,341 --> 00:56:33,641
The scone is so soft.

1368
00:56:33,641 --> 00:56:35,574
It only shows Hyorim eating.

1369
00:56:35,574 --> 00:56:37,974
I think Hongki is already full.

1370
00:56:37,974 --> 00:56:40,007
- Was he even there next to you? / - Back then...

1371
00:56:40,007 --> 00:56:42,341
I was just waiting for her to finish eating.

1372
00:56:43,141 --> 00:56:45,841
I get to experience all sorts of stuff thanks to you.

1373
00:56:46,641 --> 00:56:48,174
When guys travel together...

1374
00:56:48,174 --> 00:56:49,307
You'd never do this.

1375
00:56:49,307 --> 00:56:50,841
It's not even that.

1376
00:56:50,841 --> 00:56:52,774
We wouldn't know a place like this even exists.

1377
00:56:53,541 --> 00:56:54,741
For real.

1378
00:56:54,741 --> 00:56:56,641
- True, guys don't really know. / - That's true.

1379
00:56:56,641 --> 00:56:58,374
- Guys don't know. / - We don't.

1380
00:56:58,374 --> 00:56:59,307
Because I'm with you,

1381
00:56:59,307 --> 00:57:01,141
I know about this 3-story building...

1382
00:57:01,141 --> 00:57:02,274
Oops...

1383
00:57:02,274 --> 00:57:05,674
These 3 levels of food.

1384
00:57:05,674 --> 00:57:06,841
Right.

1385
00:57:06,841 --> 00:57:09,307
(This sure tastes yummy)

1386
00:57:09,474 --> 00:57:14,741
(Tier 3, sweets and desserts)

1387
00:57:14,741 --> 00:57:16,441
- Let's hurry up and finish this. / - Alright.

1388
00:57:16,907 --> 00:57:20,541
Man, I feel like you've been eating for 3 hours.

1389
00:57:21,274 --> 00:57:22,074
(Disbelief)

1390
00:57:22,074 --> 00:57:25,307
You shouldn't lie on TV.

1391
00:57:25,307 --> 00:57:29,207
He kept complaining that I took 3 hours.

1392
00:57:29,207 --> 00:57:31,374
It felt like 3 hours to me.

1393
00:57:31,907 --> 00:57:34,174
She made it to the top all by herself.

1394
00:57:34,807 --> 00:57:36,974
She made it to the third floor.

1395
00:57:36,974 --> 00:57:40,574
This place sure is cute though.

1396
00:57:41,307 --> 00:57:43,441
Even that street was so pretty.

1397
00:57:43,441 --> 00:57:45,841
- There aren't that many people. / - Yes.

1398
00:57:46,641 --> 00:57:48,807
I want to buy a cup like this.

1399
00:57:48,807 --> 00:57:50,274
Wow, what a pretty hat.

1400
00:57:50,274 --> 00:57:52,174
This place is packed.

1401
00:57:52,174 --> 00:57:54,741
- Let's go inside. / - I love hat shops like this.

1402
00:57:54,741 --> 00:57:55,941
(Hyorim loves hats)

1403
00:57:55,941 --> 00:57:57,241
This place is great!

1404
00:57:59,974 --> 00:58:02,107
You might be stuck in there forever.

1405
00:58:02,107 --> 00:58:05,374
- You'll ruin your schedule. / - I love hats.

1406
00:58:05,374 --> 00:58:09,141
They had hats that English nobility would wear.

1407
00:58:09,141 --> 00:58:12,174
When Prince Harry got married recently,

1408
00:58:12,174 --> 00:58:15,207
the guests wore hats that went like this.

1409
00:58:15,207 --> 00:58:15,941
Hats like that.

1410
00:58:15,941 --> 00:58:18,441
- Like the ones with veils? / - Right.

1411
00:58:18,441 --> 00:58:21,207
This hat is so comfortable.

1412
00:58:21,207 --> 00:58:23,207
Where did Hongki go?

1413
00:58:25,141 --> 00:58:25,807
Huh?

1414
00:58:26,307 --> 00:58:26,974
Huh?

1415
00:58:27,641 --> 00:58:30,741
Wow, I love visors like this.

1416
00:58:31,174 --> 00:58:32,141
Gosh, where is that hat?

1417
00:58:32,141 --> 00:58:36,441
The one the model is wearing...

1418
00:58:37,574 --> 00:58:38,374
Wow!

1419
00:58:38,374 --> 00:58:39,674
So many different hats.

1420
00:58:39,674 --> 00:58:41,574
- It looks nice. / - You look good in anything.

1421
00:58:41,574 --> 00:58:43,774
- They suit you. / - You look good in hats.

1422
00:58:43,774 --> 00:58:45,007
Goodness...

1423
00:58:45,707 --> 00:58:47,574
- This one's so pretty. / - This one is pretty.

1424
00:58:47,574 --> 00:58:49,407
Right? I'm getting this.

1425
00:58:49,407 --> 00:58:50,474
- This is nice. / - Yeah.

1426
00:58:52,007 --> 00:58:53,007
(How long are we going to look at hats?)

1427
00:58:53,007 --> 00:58:54,207
- This one's nice. / - Yeah.

1428
00:58:54,207 --> 00:58:56,241
Hongki is starting to get impatient.

1429
00:58:56,241 --> 00:58:59,207
Men just wear baseball caps...

1430
00:58:59,841 --> 00:59:01,241
I'm going to check out some plates

1431
00:59:01,241 --> 00:59:02,041
at a different shop.

1432
00:59:02,041 --> 00:59:02,974
Alright.

1433
00:59:02,974 --> 00:59:03,807
He's going on his own.

1434
00:59:03,807 --> 00:59:06,141
- This is when you should split up. / - Right.

1435
00:59:06,141 --> 00:59:08,074
I need to look around more.

1436
00:59:09,807 --> 00:59:11,307
I want plates.

1437
00:59:11,307 --> 00:59:12,674
I saw some earlier.

1438
00:59:13,141 --> 00:59:14,941
I should've came here sooner.

1439
00:59:14,941 --> 00:59:16,841
- It's closed. / - Yes.

1440
00:59:16,841 --> 00:59:18,807
Did you say it closes at 3?

1441
00:59:18,807 --> 00:59:20,607
Too bad.

1442
00:59:20,607 --> 00:59:22,274
(He looks sad from behind)

1443
00:59:22,274 --> 00:59:24,641
This place closes early.

1444
00:59:24,641 --> 00:59:26,907
We took too long for afternoon tea.

1445
00:59:27,541 --> 00:59:30,707
- You spent the entire afternoon. / - For real.

1446
00:59:30,707 --> 00:59:33,107
It's so sad when you want to buy something

1447
00:59:33,107 --> 00:59:34,574
but the place is closed.

1448
00:59:34,574 --> 00:59:36,507
And you have to leave the next day.

1449
00:59:38,107 --> 00:59:40,541
All they sell is alcohol.

1450
00:59:41,107 --> 00:59:44,141
(Any cups in there?)

1451
00:59:44,141 --> 00:59:45,741
I know that feeling.

1452
00:59:47,541 --> 00:59:50,507
(He can't seem to walk away)

1453
00:59:50,507 --> 00:59:52,541
(He goes back to the hat shop after looking around)

1454
00:59:52,541 --> 00:59:54,974
- I went back. / - Poor guy.

1455
00:59:55,607 --> 00:59:56,807
What is it?

1456
00:59:58,941 --> 01:00:00,907
She's still in there?

1457
01:00:02,207 --> 01:00:03,441
Oh, me?

1458
01:00:07,974 --> 01:00:09,241
(She's still checking out hats)

1459
01:00:09,241 --> 01:00:11,174
I need to buy something special.

1460
01:00:11,174 --> 01:00:12,241
Geez...

1461
01:00:12,241 --> 01:00:14,007
I was in there for about an hour.

1462
01:00:15,074 --> 01:00:17,541
- I got one. / - That one?

1463
01:00:17,541 --> 01:00:18,407
- Yeah, this one. / - Oh!

1464
01:00:18,407 --> 01:00:20,141
- How cute! / - That's a case?

1465
01:00:20,707 --> 01:00:21,974
It looks nice.

1466
01:00:21,974 --> 01:00:23,907
- You're lying. / - No, it looks nice.

1467
01:00:23,907 --> 01:00:26,441
- It does? / - Yeah. It's nice.

1468
01:00:26,441 --> 01:00:28,241
A waste of money though.

1469
01:00:29,274 --> 01:00:30,474
Let's go.

1470
01:00:30,474 --> 01:00:31,641
Did you wait long?

1471
01:00:31,641 --> 01:00:32,674
- Sorry. / - I was going to buy one too...

1472
01:00:32,674 --> 01:00:34,674
But I have a lot of similar ones.

1473
01:00:34,674 --> 01:00:35,841
Really?

1474
01:00:36,907 --> 01:00:37,841
(Trip to the small cities in Canada)

1475
01:00:37,841 --> 01:00:40,074
(Famous local restaurant)

1476
01:00:40,074 --> 01:00:42,141
A friend of mine in Canada

1477
01:00:42,141 --> 01:00:44,441
recommended this restaurant.

1478
01:00:45,307 --> 01:00:47,474
- It looks like Japan. / - We're here to eat.

1479
01:00:47,474 --> 01:00:48,441
It really does look like Japan.

1480
01:00:48,441 --> 01:00:50,374
It was very unfamiliar for us too.

1481
01:00:50,374 --> 01:00:51,307
(Looking around)

1482
01:00:52,241 --> 01:00:54,241
I think this is the entrance.

1483
01:00:55,407 --> 01:00:57,007
- There's no entrance. / - For real.

1484
01:00:57,007 --> 01:00:58,474
- Where's the entrance? / - What is this?

1485
01:00:58,474 --> 01:01:00,541
- That's a restaurant? / - Yes.

1486
01:01:00,541 --> 01:01:02,107
We used the GPS to find it.

1487
01:01:02,107 --> 01:01:02,941
There's nobody there.

1488
01:01:02,941 --> 01:01:04,707
- We found it on the map. / - We kept looking.

1489
01:01:04,707 --> 01:01:06,974
- Isn't that it? / - I think it's here.

1490
01:01:06,974 --> 01:01:08,241
Isn't that a door?

1491
01:01:08,241 --> 01:01:09,874
I think this is it.

1492
01:01:09,874 --> 01:01:11,274
Someone came out.

1493
01:01:11,274 --> 01:01:12,474
(The door opens)

1494
01:01:12,641 --> 01:01:14,041
- Hello. / - Hello.

1495
01:01:14,041 --> 01:01:16,474
- Fine, how are you? / - Good, thanks.

1496
01:01:16,474 --> 01:01:17,741
- This is nice. / - How are you doing?

1497
01:01:17,741 --> 01:01:18,374
Good.

1498
01:01:18,374 --> 01:01:20,041
- It looks empty. / - I was shocked.

1499
01:01:20,041 --> 01:01:20,407
What is it?

1500
01:01:20,407 --> 01:01:21,907
- Wow. / - Wow, what is this?

1501
01:01:23,441 --> 01:01:24,974
(A place loved by locals and tourists)

1502
01:01:24,974 --> 01:01:26,674
You will be shocked.

1503
01:01:26,674 --> 01:01:31,974
They raise the animals very ethically

1504
01:01:31,974 --> 01:01:35,107
for their dishes.

1505
01:01:35,107 --> 01:01:37,074
That's what it said there.

1506
01:01:37,074 --> 01:01:40,107
They grow their own vegetables...

1507
01:01:40,107 --> 01:01:42,307
- They grow everything? / - It was organic.

1508
01:01:43,407 --> 01:01:45,074
This is pretty cool.

1509
01:01:45,074 --> 01:01:46,974
- It's pretty. / - That's what it looks like inside.

1510
01:01:47,707 --> 01:01:48,407
This is cool.

1511
01:01:48,407 --> 01:01:50,741
It was so quiet outside, but it's packed inside.

1512
01:01:51,441 --> 01:01:53,374
- The door was hard to find. / - What is this?

1513
01:01:53,374 --> 01:01:54,407
I bet it was very new.

1514
01:01:54,407 --> 01:01:55,474
So many people here.

1515
01:01:55,474 --> 01:01:57,507
This place has a twist.

1516
01:01:57,507 --> 01:01:58,974
When you're outside...

1517
01:01:58,974 --> 01:02:01,107
It's so different from outside.

1518
01:02:01,107 --> 01:02:02,241
How is this possible?

1519
01:02:02,241 --> 01:02:03,841
Did they open this place secretly?

1520
01:02:05,007 --> 01:02:06,474
Secretly...

1521
01:02:06,907 --> 01:02:08,407
From the outside...

1522
01:02:08,407 --> 01:02:11,174
- It didn't look like a restaurant. / - Right.

1523
01:02:11,174 --> 01:02:13,141
- This is cool. / - Yeah.

1524
01:02:14,541 --> 01:02:16,707
(Time to pick something from the menu!)

1525
01:02:16,707 --> 01:02:18,307
Look at this.

1526
01:02:19,274 --> 01:02:21,607
This place is hot these days.

1527
01:02:21,607 --> 01:02:23,507
(Even the menu looks cool)

1528
01:02:24,374 --> 01:02:27,474
This is so funny. This dish is called Dip-dip Egg.

1529
01:02:27,474 --> 01:02:30,674
Oh, I heard this is really good.

1530
01:02:30,674 --> 01:02:32,341
Dip-dip Egg.

1531
01:02:33,407 --> 01:02:35,374
Let's order something new.

1532
01:02:36,241 --> 01:02:37,307
No chicken this time?

1533
01:02:37,307 --> 01:02:38,507
(Deliberating)

1534
01:02:38,507 --> 01:02:40,007
Don't order chicken, Hongki.

1535
01:02:41,107 --> 01:02:42,441
I want the chicken.

1536
01:02:42,907 --> 01:02:45,474
(Chicken again?)

1537
01:02:46,074 --> 01:02:47,541
- Please... / - Geez...

1538
01:02:47,541 --> 01:02:48,541
Oh, my God.

1539
01:02:48,541 --> 01:02:50,607
- I want the chicken. / - Chicken...

1540
01:02:51,041 --> 01:02:52,974
(Pleased)

1541
01:02:53,274 --> 01:02:54,874
Don't they have any chicken?

1542
01:02:54,874 --> 01:02:56,574
(Hongki's love of chicken was seen last time)

1543
01:02:57,941 --> 01:03:00,274
(Chicken makes Hongki happy)

1544
01:03:00,274 --> 01:03:02,641
What's wrong with me? Geez...

1545
01:03:02,641 --> 01:03:05,241
Try some other stuff, Hongki. Please...

1546
01:03:05,241 --> 01:03:08,307
I even had spicy chicken stew today.

1547
01:03:08,774 --> 01:03:10,841
He really loves chicken.

1548
01:03:11,841 --> 01:03:14,574
(The first dish comes out)

1549
01:03:15,074 --> 01:03:17,641
(He brought a wine glass)

1550
01:03:19,041 --> 01:03:19,941
(Fills up the glass)

1551
01:03:19,941 --> 01:03:22,174
- That was delicious. / - What is that?

1552
01:03:22,174 --> 01:03:24,774
It was a drink before the meal.

1553
01:03:24,774 --> 01:03:26,741
It's an alcoholic beverage that piques the appetite.

1554
01:03:26,741 --> 01:03:28,541
This is so neat.

1555
01:03:28,541 --> 01:03:30,274
This is icewine.

1556
01:03:30,274 --> 01:03:31,741
- It's alcohol? / - Yes...

1557
01:03:31,741 --> 01:03:33,207
- A cocktail? / - It's wine.

1558
01:03:33,207 --> 01:03:34,874
- It's wine? / - Icewine?

1559
01:03:34,874 --> 01:03:35,474
Yes.

1560
01:03:35,474 --> 01:03:37,174
That looks so good!

1561
01:03:37,707 --> 01:03:40,141
- Isn't this... / - Raspberry sorbet.

1562
01:03:40,141 --> 01:03:41,941
That's raspberry sorbet.

1563
01:03:41,941 --> 01:03:43,507
This is icewine?

1564
01:03:43,507 --> 01:03:46,374
But it wasn't too strong. It was delicious.

1565
01:03:46,374 --> 01:03:47,774
It was so good.

1566
01:03:47,774 --> 01:03:50,374
I could've kept drinking that if it wasn't for the shoot.

1567
01:03:50,807 --> 01:03:52,441
(Mm)

1568
01:03:52,441 --> 01:03:53,541
Mix it up?

1569
01:03:53,541 --> 01:03:55,141
Do you mix it up or just drink it?

1570
01:03:55,141 --> 01:03:57,174
- I wasn't sure either. / - Mix it up?

1571
01:03:57,174 --> 01:03:58,874
This comes with a spoon.

1572
01:03:58,874 --> 01:04:00,541
Oh, you're supposed to mix it up?

1573
01:04:01,307 --> 01:04:03,741
I have no idea either. It's my first time here.

1574
01:04:04,274 --> 01:04:06,241
I'm not sure.

1575
01:04:06,241 --> 01:04:08,941
Icewine is supposed to be a dessert wine.

1576
01:04:08,941 --> 01:04:12,441
But since we already had wine,

1577
01:04:12,441 --> 01:04:14,507
this will be a drink before our meal.

1578
01:04:17,774 --> 01:04:21,141
(That's the stuff)

1579
01:04:21,574 --> 01:04:22,441
In one gulp.

1580
01:04:24,907 --> 01:04:26,674
(Delicious)

1581
01:04:28,074 --> 01:04:30,174
This is what this tastes like.

1582
01:04:30,174 --> 01:04:32,474
It tastes like they melted frozen icewine.

1583
01:04:32,474 --> 01:04:34,407
- It's like a slushy. / - Yeah.

1584
01:04:34,407 --> 01:04:37,507
It's different from the icewine we had earlier.

1585
01:04:37,507 --> 01:04:39,307
That's so unique.

1586
01:04:40,674 --> 01:04:42,707
I got really into wine on this trip.

1587
01:04:43,974 --> 01:04:45,141
This is good.

1588
01:04:45,841 --> 01:04:47,107
What is this?

1589
01:04:48,141 --> 01:04:49,441
What is this?

1590
01:04:49,441 --> 01:04:50,674
(Their appetizers come out)

1591
01:04:50,674 --> 01:04:52,507
- That. / - What is this?

1592
01:04:52,507 --> 01:04:53,474
(A nest?)

1593
01:04:53,474 --> 01:04:54,874
- What's that? / - Dip-dip Egg.

1594
01:04:54,874 --> 01:04:56,141
- What's that? / - This is?

1595
01:04:57,674 --> 01:05:00,007
It's Dip-dip Egg.

1596
01:05:00,007 --> 01:05:03,074
- This is Dip-dip Egg? / - Dip-dip Egg.

1597
01:05:03,074 --> 01:05:04,407
Gosh!

1598
01:05:04,407 --> 01:05:06,141
So, you dip something in there?

1599
01:05:06,141 --> 01:05:08,841
It has dipping sauce in it.

1600
01:05:08,841 --> 01:05:10,341
You dip your bread into that.

1601
01:05:10,341 --> 01:05:13,107
(Dip the bread into the egg)

1602
01:05:14,907 --> 01:05:16,807
- That brioche looks great. / - It's a sauce?

1603
01:05:16,807 --> 01:05:18,441
- It was delicious. / - So good.

1604
01:05:18,441 --> 01:05:19,807
What's in that egg?

1605
01:05:19,807 --> 01:05:23,141
- It's egg. / - They mixed something with runny yolk.

1606
01:05:23,141 --> 01:05:24,407
(Amazing)

1607
01:05:25,474 --> 01:05:28,541
It doesn't seem like egg,

1608
01:05:28,541 --> 01:05:29,841
but it tastes like egg.

1609
01:05:30,307 --> 01:05:32,974
I don't think anyone that tries this

1610
01:05:32,974 --> 01:05:35,974
will say it tastes bad.

1611
01:05:35,974 --> 01:05:37,341
Definitely.

1612
01:05:37,341 --> 01:05:39,341
So thoughtful.

1613
01:05:39,341 --> 01:05:42,274
Such pretty plating.

1614
01:05:42,274 --> 01:05:44,241
- It was so good. / - Truly.

1615
01:05:44,241 --> 01:05:46,841
Whoever says this tastes bad is an idiot.

1616
01:05:46,841 --> 01:05:48,641
It has to be good if Hongki says it is.

1617
01:05:48,907 --> 01:05:50,374
(Off to a great start so far)

1618
01:05:50,374 --> 01:05:51,707
This is good.

1619
01:05:53,007 --> 01:05:54,707
(The meal is just beginning)

1620
01:05:54,707 --> 01:05:56,507
If the appetizer is good...

1621
01:05:56,507 --> 01:05:59,207
- The expectation for the main dish rises. / - Right.

1622
01:05:59,207 --> 01:05:59,941
(Fish steak)

1623
01:05:59,941 --> 01:06:01,607
They were all good.

1624
01:06:01,607 --> 01:06:03,041
(Chicken steak)

1625
01:06:03,041 --> 01:06:05,507
(Beef steak)

1626
01:06:06,674 --> 01:06:07,974
Wow, they're here.

1627
01:06:08,407 --> 01:06:09,674
Fish.

1628
01:06:10,674 --> 01:06:12,907
That fish looks delicious.

1629
01:06:12,907 --> 01:06:14,474
Such clean plating.

1630
01:06:15,207 --> 01:06:17,574
(A white fish fillet is first fried in oil)

1631
01:06:19,141 --> 01:06:20,607
- What's that? / - All their food...

1632
01:06:20,607 --> 01:06:22,374
- Is cooked in a brick oven. / - A brick oven?

1633
01:06:24,441 --> 01:06:26,607
- Then it's grilled in the pan again? / - Yes, again.

1634
01:06:26,607 --> 01:06:27,941
That looks so good.

1635
01:06:27,941 --> 01:06:29,474
That looks good.

1636
01:06:30,974 --> 01:06:33,341
(Seared twice in the pan, baked once in the oven)

1637
01:06:33,341 --> 01:06:35,041
(To make the fish more firm)

1638
01:06:35,041 --> 01:06:37,241
(The fish steak is moist and firm)

1639
01:06:37,241 --> 01:06:39,574
- That looks delicious. / - It's a bit rare.

1640
01:06:41,441 --> 01:06:43,441
I don't think we'll need a knife.

1641
01:06:44,074 --> 01:06:46,307
I ordered this fish.

1642
01:06:46,607 --> 01:06:47,941
This is like one bite.

1643
01:06:47,941 --> 01:06:49,441
I was a bit surprised.

1644
01:06:49,441 --> 01:06:51,841
- That's so small. / - It's too small.

1645
01:06:51,841 --> 01:06:53,341
(Watch)

1646
01:06:53,341 --> 01:06:54,341
One bite.

1647
01:06:56,474 --> 01:06:57,741
Done.

1648
01:06:57,741 --> 01:06:59,341
That's pretty pricy then.

1649
01:06:59,341 --> 01:07:00,507
That's not a big portion.

1650
01:07:00,507 --> 01:07:01,841
- But the thing is... / - It turns out...

1651
01:07:01,841 --> 01:07:03,874
They gave us half portions of each...

1652
01:07:03,874 --> 01:07:05,207
- Thinking that we'd share. / - They split it up.

1653
01:07:06,041 --> 01:07:07,707
(That's why)

1654
01:07:07,707 --> 01:07:09,674
No wonder it looked so small.

1655
01:07:09,674 --> 01:07:11,141
I thought something went wrong,

1656
01:07:11,141 --> 01:07:13,574
but they split up the portions.

1657
01:07:13,574 --> 01:07:16,074
- Yum, this is delicious. / - It really is.

1658
01:07:16,074 --> 01:07:18,374
- So good. / - This is good.

1659
01:07:24,307 --> 01:07:25,507
Here it comes.

1660
01:07:26,674 --> 01:07:28,541
- That one was great too. / - It was so good!

1661
01:07:28,541 --> 01:07:31,041
- That's chicken? / - But it was stuffed...

1662
01:07:31,041 --> 01:07:32,274
- That's new. / - Yes.

1663
01:07:32,674 --> 01:07:35,407
- What is it? / - It was stuffed chicken.

1664
01:07:37,341 --> 01:07:38,874
(Nom)

1665
01:07:38,874 --> 01:07:40,574
This smells great.

1666
01:07:41,541 --> 01:07:43,907
I like how the outside is crispy.

1667
01:07:43,907 --> 01:07:46,607
They stuffed this chicken breast with tender meat.

1668
01:07:47,874 --> 01:07:49,207
The chicken was rolled up.

1669
01:07:49,207 --> 01:07:52,241
You know the tender part? That was on the outside

1670
01:07:52,241 --> 01:07:54,474
and the dry meat was stuffed in the inside.

1671
01:07:54,474 --> 01:07:56,641
So they wrapped the chicken breast.

1672
01:07:56,641 --> 01:07:58,941
- So that entire thing is chicken? / - Yes.

1673
01:07:58,941 --> 01:08:00,541
That looks so good.

1674
01:08:01,207 --> 01:08:03,807
Seulgi's so cute. She keeps saying "I want to try that."

1675
01:08:04,407 --> 01:08:06,641
- "That looks good." / - It looks so good...

1676
01:08:06,641 --> 01:08:07,774
"I want to try that."

1677
01:08:08,374 --> 01:08:10,941
I love the sauce. It's like peanut sauce.

1678
01:08:12,541 --> 01:08:15,141
I don't really like chicken...

1679
01:08:21,374 --> 01:08:24,541
I prefer the veggies served on the side

1680
01:08:24,541 --> 01:08:25,841
over this chicken.

1681
01:08:26,907 --> 01:08:29,307
The vegetables are cooked so nicely.

1682
01:08:32,007 --> 01:08:33,841
You should like this one.

1683
01:08:35,741 --> 01:08:37,807
(Sirloin steak, $40.80)

1684
01:08:37,807 --> 01:08:39,374
Sirloin?

1685
01:08:42,707 --> 01:08:45,707
(Sauce to make it taste better)

1686
01:08:48,907 --> 01:08:49,607
What sauce is this?

1687
01:08:49,607 --> 01:08:51,141
The sauce is bearnaise sauce.

1688
01:08:51,141 --> 01:08:53,574
(Made of egg, butter and herbs like hollandaise)

1689
01:08:53,574 --> 01:08:55,941
(This sauce goes great with meat)

1690
01:08:57,774 --> 01:09:00,174
It looks fattening.

1691
01:09:00,174 --> 01:09:02,474
The sauce looks delicious.

1692
01:09:03,941 --> 01:09:05,007
(Yum)

1693
01:09:05,007 --> 01:09:05,807
Thank you.

1694
01:09:07,907 --> 01:09:12,441
(She cuts a piece and tries a bite)

1695
01:09:14,274 --> 01:09:16,507
This meat is so tender.

1696
01:09:18,207 --> 01:09:19,441
It's not tough at all.

1697
01:09:19,441 --> 01:09:20,941
(The steak is delicious because it's been aged)

1698
01:09:20,941 --> 01:09:23,641
I love when meat is this texture.

1699
01:09:24,274 --> 01:09:25,907
This is a unique sauce.

1700
01:09:27,074 --> 01:09:30,974
The sauce is the color of mustard.

1701
01:09:30,974 --> 01:09:34,207
- All those food go well with wine, right? / - Yes.

1702
01:09:35,241 --> 01:09:38,574
It's near a winery.

1703
01:09:38,574 --> 01:09:40,241
That's why a lot of places around there...

1704
01:09:40,241 --> 01:09:42,707
There are a lot of restaurants that sell

1705
01:09:42,707 --> 01:09:45,141
dishes that go great with wine.

1706
01:09:45,141 --> 01:09:47,807
I don't really like steak that much.

1707
01:09:47,807 --> 01:09:50,874
But this steak is so tender.

1708
01:09:50,874 --> 01:09:52,741
For real.

1709
01:09:52,741 --> 01:09:55,774
- More than Korea. / - I really enjoyed this steak...

1710
01:09:55,774 --> 01:09:58,474
But it seemed more like smoked meat.

1711
01:09:58,474 --> 01:10:02,141
I don't know if I should even call this a steak.

1712
01:10:02,141 --> 01:10:05,541
Steak has that slightly charred taste.

1713
01:10:06,641 --> 01:10:11,641
But this meat is really tender.

1714
01:10:11,641 --> 01:10:14,241
- So it's like ham? / - Yes, like it was smoked.

1715
01:10:14,907 --> 01:10:18,374
Since we're full from eating, how about a walk?

1716
01:10:18,374 --> 01:10:19,241
You need to digest.

1717
01:10:19,241 --> 01:10:20,807
I heard this neighborhood

1718
01:10:20,807 --> 01:10:24,574
has a lot of cute shops, so let's check them out.

1719
01:10:24,574 --> 01:10:25,774
Alright.

1720
01:10:25,774 --> 01:10:28,807
This is almost like a date.

1721
01:10:28,807 --> 01:10:33,107
If you cut off the audio, you two seem like a couple.

1722
01:10:33,107 --> 01:10:35,041
But all you two do is fight.

1723
01:10:35,041 --> 01:10:36,741
- Fighting and complaining. / - Right.

1724
01:10:36,741 --> 01:10:39,474
If you cut off the audio, you two seem like a couple.

1725
01:10:39,474 --> 01:10:41,774
(The highlight of their trip)

1726
01:10:42,874 --> 01:10:44,507
(Enjoying some cold beer outdoors at a brewery)

1727
01:10:44,507 --> 01:10:45,874
This is a brewery.

1728
01:10:45,874 --> 01:10:48,074
Yeah, they make beer here.

1729
01:10:48,074 --> 01:10:52,607
(This pub is already pretty packed at 9 p.m.)

1730
01:10:53,574 --> 01:10:55,374
This is so nice.

1731
01:10:55,374 --> 01:10:57,807
(Enjoying a live performance on their last night)

1732
01:10:58,874 --> 01:11:02,407
I love that we're out in nature like this.

1733
01:11:02,407 --> 01:11:03,907
- Being outdoors like this? / - Yeah.

1734
01:11:03,907 --> 01:11:05,541
- I love this. / - This is nice.

1735
01:11:05,541 --> 01:11:07,007
I want to build a place like this too.

1736
01:11:07,007 --> 01:11:08,674
(A brewery with a vineyard nearby)

1737
01:11:10,241 --> 01:11:12,941
Wendy, stop scowling. Are you okay?

1738
01:11:13,607 --> 01:11:15,341
She's just really impressed.

1739
01:11:15,341 --> 01:11:16,707
I want to go too.

1740
01:11:16,707 --> 01:11:17,941
I love that atmosphere.

1741
01:11:17,941 --> 01:11:21,607
A vineyard right behind you as you have beer?

1742
01:11:21,607 --> 01:11:23,674
- With a performance. / - They kept performing.

1743
01:11:23,674 --> 01:11:26,107
- It was wonderful. / - That look so nice.

1744
01:11:27,407 --> 01:11:28,874
It's so pretty.

1745
01:11:29,841 --> 01:11:32,241
- I want to build a place like this too. / - It's so nice.

1746
01:11:34,774 --> 01:11:35,774
I like this.

1747
01:11:36,707 --> 01:11:38,441
I love this sort of thing.

1748
01:11:38,441 --> 01:11:41,141
(Getting into it)

1749
01:11:41,574 --> 01:11:45,074
(This is so nice)

1750
01:11:45,674 --> 01:11:47,907
(Time for some cold beer)

1751
01:11:49,774 --> 01:11:52,041
(There's something unique about this brewery)

1752
01:11:52,041 --> 01:11:54,141
They make their own beer here.

1753
01:11:54,141 --> 01:11:55,807
Did you see the tank earlier?

1754
01:11:56,274 --> 01:11:57,774
That's where they make the beer.

1755
01:11:57,774 --> 01:11:59,574
(They make beer in barrels from wineries)

1756
01:12:01,641 --> 01:12:03,074
It's craft beer.

1757
01:12:03,074 --> 01:12:06,707
(Special beer you can try at a winery)

1758
01:12:08,607 --> 01:12:12,807
($5.60, $3.80, $5.60, $5,60)

1759
01:12:12,807 --> 01:12:14,041
How strong are they?

1760
01:12:14,041 --> 01:12:16,107
- Well... / - They're a bit strong.

1761
01:12:16,541 --> 01:12:17,907
Which one was the best?

1762
01:12:17,907 --> 01:12:19,507
I liked one of the dark one.

1763
01:12:19,507 --> 01:12:20,341
I'd get the IPA.

1764
01:12:20,341 --> 01:12:21,607
One of the dark was strong.

1765
01:12:21,607 --> 01:12:23,341
The dark one was strong.

1766
01:12:23,341 --> 01:12:24,507
Man, I want beer now.

1767
01:12:24,507 --> 01:12:28,641
This one is dark in color, but it's sour like a candy.

1768
01:12:28,707 --> 01:12:30,441
- Really? / - It's sour.

1769
01:12:30,474 --> 01:12:31,507
The flavor is...

1770
01:12:31,507 --> 01:12:35,974
(Hongki is the first one to try it)

1771
01:12:37,807 --> 01:12:39,974
- What's with the face? / - Is it good?

1772
01:12:39,974 --> 01:12:43,574
No, there are two dark ones.

1773
01:12:43,574 --> 01:12:44,207
There were two?

1774
01:12:44,207 --> 01:12:46,307
(Tart)

1775
01:12:46,307 --> 01:12:47,241
How is it?

1776
01:12:47,774 --> 01:12:49,807
- How is it? / - What was that?

1777
01:12:49,807 --> 01:12:51,307
- What? / - Try it!

1778
01:12:53,507 --> 01:12:55,774
It tastes very unique.

1779
01:12:55,774 --> 01:12:58,874
- You're downing it all again? / - Look at her eyes!

1780
01:12:58,874 --> 01:13:00,574
She looks scary with her eyes like that!

1781
01:13:03,241 --> 01:13:04,974
It's like lemon soda.

1782
01:13:04,974 --> 01:13:06,607
It's very tart.

1783
01:13:07,141 --> 01:13:08,907
This one's really interesting.

1784
01:13:08,907 --> 01:13:11,607
The carbonation really has some bite to it.

1785
01:13:11,607 --> 01:13:13,507
- I feel like this will aid digestion. / - Yeah.

1786
01:13:13,507 --> 01:13:15,341
This doesn't seem like beer.

1787
01:13:15,341 --> 01:13:16,741
This one's really different.

1788
01:13:17,141 --> 01:13:20,107
(They try the other beers)

1789
01:13:20,107 --> 01:13:23,374
Bottoms up! Bottoms up!

1790
01:13:23,374 --> 01:13:25,907
(Hongki loves this sweet and bitter ale)

1791
01:13:27,507 --> 01:13:32,641
It's good because it's craft beer and it's draft beer.

1792
01:13:35,374 --> 01:13:39,107
(Draft beer is always the best)

1793
01:13:40,074 --> 01:13:43,641
(Delicious)

1794
01:13:44,607 --> 01:13:47,007
It's over now.

1795
01:13:47,007 --> 01:13:48,441
Yeah.

1796
01:13:49,407 --> 01:13:51,807
(Pouting out of sorrow)

1797
01:13:51,807 --> 01:13:54,741
I had a great trip thanks to you.

1798
01:13:54,741 --> 01:13:58,374
Of course, we mostly did stuff that you like.

1799
01:13:58,374 --> 01:14:00,307
But it wasn't so bad!

1800
01:14:00,974 --> 01:14:03,374
I got to learn a lot about Canada.

1801
01:14:03,374 --> 01:14:06,474
This place is very different

1802
01:14:06,474 --> 01:14:07,874
from the Canada I had in mind.

1803
01:14:07,874 --> 01:14:10,207
Especially this neighborhood.

1804
01:14:10,207 --> 01:14:13,341
I felt two things on this trip to Canada.

1805
01:14:13,341 --> 01:14:15,474
First, it was the nature.

1806
01:14:15,474 --> 01:14:17,507
Canada's nature is amazing.

1807
01:14:17,507 --> 01:14:23,074
And the feeling that everyone is so respectful.

1808
01:14:23,074 --> 01:14:25,874
Even if you speak a different language,

1809
01:14:25,874 --> 01:14:28,874
everyone seemed very friendly.

1810
01:14:28,874 --> 01:14:30,941
The only thing I knew about Canada

1811
01:14:30,941 --> 01:14:33,307
before coming here was the Niagara Falls.

1812
01:14:33,307 --> 01:14:35,241
And this is eastern Canada.

1813
01:14:36,774 --> 01:14:41,574
All the small cities and towns

1814
01:14:41,574 --> 01:14:44,107
were so charming.

1815
01:14:44,107 --> 01:14:45,841
I was jealous of that helicopter ride.

1816
01:14:45,841 --> 01:14:47,874
- A trip like this... / - Great work.

1817
01:14:47,874 --> 01:14:50,274
- Thanks! / - It must've been tough following me.

1818
01:14:51,607 --> 01:14:52,807
How nice.

1819
01:14:52,807 --> 01:14:56,941
(Realistic Sibling Tour ends here!)

1820
01:14:58,807 --> 01:15:00,307
(Totally satisfied)

1821
01:15:01,207 --> 01:15:05,407
- I was amazed by the helicopter scene. / - Me too.

1822
01:15:05,407 --> 01:15:08,107
Some people might be nervous about a helicopter,

1823
01:15:08,107 --> 01:15:10,907
but they have the latest model, so it's a comfy ride.

1824
01:15:10,907 --> 01:15:12,707
That feeling when you get off...

1825
01:15:12,707 --> 01:15:15,107
- Like you're royalty. / - How much was it?

1826
01:15:15,107 --> 01:15:16,674
6 people is the fixed number.

1827
01:15:16,674 --> 01:15:20,707
We did a lap around Niagara Falls

1828
01:15:20,707 --> 01:15:23,807
and then it dropped us off in front of the winery.

1829
01:15:23,807 --> 01:15:25,307
That's $280 per person.

1830
01:15:25,307 --> 01:15:26,641
What costs $120?

1831
01:15:26,641 --> 01:15:30,174
- Just touring the Niagara Falls. / - So that's $120?

1832
01:15:30,174 --> 01:15:34,341
- But it doesn't fly you back. / - It's one-way.

1833
01:15:35,574 --> 01:15:38,074
A helicopter tour of the Grand Canyon

1834
01:15:38,074 --> 01:15:39,407
was $500 per person.

1835
01:15:39,407 --> 01:15:41,174
The helicopter tour of the Rocky Mountains

1836
01:15:41,174 --> 01:15:43,107
was $900 per person.

1837
01:15:43,107 --> 01:15:46,074
The winery tour is one-way...

1838
01:15:46,074 --> 01:15:47,974
- And it's not as far. / - Right.

1839
01:15:47,974 --> 01:15:49,774
You won't get bored.

1840
01:15:49,774 --> 01:15:52,807
So it's between $120 to $280.

1841
01:15:52,807 --> 01:15:54,707
- It seems worth the investment. / - Of course.

1842
01:15:54,707 --> 01:15:56,641
- You might as well. / - When else would you go?

1843
01:15:56,641 --> 01:15:58,607
Time for us to find out the total cost.

1844
01:15:58,607 --> 01:16:00,741
Let's see how much they spent.

1845
01:16:00,741 --> 01:16:02,774
Canada is a bit pricy, isn't it?

1846
01:16:02,774 --> 01:16:04,307
- No. / - Really?

1847
01:16:04,307 --> 01:16:07,641
- Not as much as you'd think. / - Not like Austria.

1848
01:16:07,641 --> 01:16:10,474
You rented a car, went on a helicopter ride...

1849
01:16:10,474 --> 01:16:13,774
I don't think it'll be a low cost.

1850
01:16:13,774 --> 01:16:14,641
Let's see it.

1851
01:16:14,641 --> 01:16:16,941
- We were there for 6 days... / - 6 days.

1852
01:16:16,941 --> 01:16:19,941
- And we spent a total of... / - How much?

1853
01:16:19,941 --> 01:16:21,507
For 6 days?

1854
01:16:21,507 --> 01:16:25,674
$1,315.30.

1855
01:16:27,707 --> 01:16:29,174
$1,300?

1856
01:16:29,174 --> 01:16:30,341
$1,300.

1857
01:16:30,341 --> 01:16:32,307
- Including the helicopter ride? / - Yes.

1858
01:16:32,307 --> 01:16:34,674
- So in a day... / - Including the hotel rooms.

1859
01:16:34,674 --> 01:16:35,941
- So you spent $300 a day. / - Including the hotel?

1860
01:16:35,941 --> 01:16:37,274
The hotel wasn't that expensive.

1861
01:16:37,274 --> 01:16:40,241
I think we can win with this.

1862
01:16:40,241 --> 01:16:44,007
If you don't do this stuff when you're in Canada...

1863
01:16:44,007 --> 01:16:45,874
- You're going to regret it. / - Right.

1864
01:16:45,874 --> 01:16:47,341
Let's see the final votes.

1865
01:16:47,341 --> 01:16:49,041
- Please be good to us. / - Please help us out.

1866
01:16:49,041 --> 01:16:50,341
Realistic Sibling Tour...

1867
01:16:50,341 --> 01:16:53,074
Would you go to Canada or not? Cast your votes!

1868
01:16:54,374 --> 01:16:56,574
(They designed a trip to a country they'd want to live in)

1869
01:16:57,007 --> 01:17:00,207
(What will the judges think?)

1870
01:17:02,074 --> 01:17:03,407
Do we have the result?

1871
01:17:03,407 --> 01:17:04,841
Don't show us yet!

1872
01:17:04,841 --> 01:17:07,074
You should show us.

1873
01:17:07,707 --> 01:17:08,441
No...

1874
01:17:08,441 --> 01:17:10,507
Can you just show me?

1875
01:17:10,507 --> 01:17:12,974
The number should be high.

1876
01:17:12,974 --> 01:17:14,674
I can't tell by Sikyung's reaction.

1877
01:17:15,541 --> 01:17:16,307
I think they got a lot of votes.

1878
01:17:16,307 --> 01:17:18,107
I'm on his team and I can't even tell.

1879
01:17:18,107 --> 01:17:19,974
- I can't tell. / - He seems flustered.

1880
01:17:19,974 --> 01:17:22,041
- His acting really improved. / - No.

1881
01:17:22,041 --> 01:17:23,607
We got a lot of votes this time.

1882
01:17:23,607 --> 01:17:25,841
We got a lot more than he expected.

1883
01:17:26,874 --> 01:17:28,507
They look worried.

1884
01:17:28,507 --> 01:17:30,174
Such poor acting.

1885
01:17:33,974 --> 01:17:36,041
- We have your votes... / - I'm worried.

1886
01:17:36,041 --> 01:17:36,707
We got a lot.

1887
01:17:36,707 --> 01:17:38,474
- And this is the total. / - A lot of people didn't move.

1888
01:17:38,474 --> 01:17:39,907
You didn't get many last time.

1889
01:17:39,907 --> 01:17:41,107
See? We got a lot.

1890
01:17:41,107 --> 01:17:42,441
You didn't get many last time.

1891
01:17:42,441 --> 01:17:44,107
See? We got a lot.

1892
01:17:44,741 --> 01:17:46,807
- We got a lot. / - We got this!

1893
01:17:47,707 --> 01:17:48,574
But this...

1894
01:17:48,574 --> 01:17:51,607
Just how many votes will you give us then?

1895
01:17:51,607 --> 01:17:53,741
With this many votes...

1896
01:17:53,741 --> 01:17:55,974
- I have no idea what will happen. / - I'm worried.

1897
01:17:57,674 --> 01:17:59,107
(Next episode)

1898
01:17:59,841 --> 01:18:03,407
(Trip to the small cities in Austria)

1899
01:18:03,407 --> 01:18:06,107
It's like I'm in a fairy tale.

1900
01:18:06,107 --> 01:18:09,007
- I love just walking here. / - Yeah.

1901
01:18:09,007 --> 01:18:11,774
It reminds me of the scenes from the movie.

1902
01:18:11,774 --> 01:18:13,007
- Wendy... / - And Seulgi!

(They'll try the sweets of Austria)

1905
01:18:17,041 --> 01:18:18,141
It's so pretty.

1906
01:18:19,241 --> 01:18:21,274
You have to try this.

1907

(Flying through the skies of Salzburg)

1908
01:18:24,741 --> 01:18:26,041
This is so much fun!

1909
01:18:26,041 --> 01:18:28,741
I'm flying!

1910
01:18:28,741 --> 01:18:30,074
Oh, my.
