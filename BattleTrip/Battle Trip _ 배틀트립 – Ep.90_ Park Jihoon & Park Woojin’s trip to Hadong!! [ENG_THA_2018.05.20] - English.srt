1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,776
I'm excited already.

2
00:00:01,776 --> 00:00:03,876
I'm filled with excitement right now.

3
00:00:03,876 --> 00:00:04,610
Look at this!

4
00:00:05,410 --> 00:00:07,110
It's so beautiful.

5
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:09,543
I can't believe I'm here.

6
00:00:09,543 --> 00:00:11,443
This my first overnight trip with a friend

7
00:00:11,443 --> 00:00:13,110
without my parents.

8
00:00:16,376 --> 00:00:17,710
No...

9
00:00:18,143 --> 00:00:19,476
Congratulations.

10
00:00:20,176 --> 00:00:22,076
- Yoobom. / - Nabom.

11
00:00:22,076 --> 00:00:23,510
Let's go!

12
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:27,843
(Which team will win?)

13
00:00:30,010 --> 00:00:33,943
(Numerous great tips on trips)

14
00:00:36,276 --> 00:00:37,810
(Mina of Gugudan, Yoojung of Weki Meki)

15
00:00:38,410 --> 00:00:39,743
(Park Jihoon and Park Woojin of Wanna One)

16
00:00:41,776 --> 00:00:43,043
Travel is war.

17
00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:45,810
Battle Trip!

18
00:00:47,376 --> 00:00:49,243
Continuing from last week,

19
00:00:49,243 --> 00:00:52,676
we are with our trip planners who planned

20
00:00:52,676 --> 00:00:54,743
a flower trip for 20-year-olds.

21
00:00:54,743 --> 00:00:56,543
- Good to see you. / - Good to see you.

22
00:00:57,943 --> 00:01:00,076
It feels like we're getting younger.

23
00:01:00,076 --> 00:01:03,510
We have our 100 20-year-old impartial judges

24
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:05,443
who will vote on today's trips!

25
00:01:05,443 --> 00:01:06,743
Nice to meet you.

26
00:01:08,143 --> 00:01:10,210
Again, we have the special event

27
00:01:10,210 --> 00:01:11,676
for watching our show.

28
00:01:11,676 --> 00:01:13,310
We have a book now.

29
00:01:13,310 --> 00:01:15,076
Post some photos on your social media

30
00:01:15,076 --> 00:01:17,443
to prove you've watched our show when it aired.

31
00:01:17,443 --> 00:01:19,910
We'll pick the winners and send you a book.

32
00:01:19,910 --> 00:01:21,376
Please watch the show

33
00:01:21,376 --> 00:01:23,443
and upload photos of you doing so.

34
00:01:23,443 --> 00:01:26,810
Last week, Jooe

35
00:01:26,810 --> 00:01:30,143
had a hard time watching the video.

36
00:01:30,143 --> 00:01:32,810
She looked like she wanted to eat so bad.

37
00:01:32,810 --> 00:01:35,143
What was the hardest part?

38
00:01:35,910 --> 00:01:38,210
The meat.

39
00:01:38,210 --> 00:01:39,676
The meat? Was it the meat?

40
00:01:39,676 --> 00:01:42,676
The macarons? The latte?

41
00:01:42,676 --> 00:01:43,810
- The meat. / - Meat.

42
00:01:44,676 --> 00:01:45,943
The bulgogi.

43
00:01:45,943 --> 00:01:48,010
I want to eat it so bad.

44
00:01:48,010 --> 00:01:49,510
My members

45
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:51,476
love to eat meat.

46
00:01:51,476 --> 00:01:55,776
The 7 of us went to a beef barbecue

47
00:01:55,776 --> 00:01:57,410
and we ate 34 servings.

48
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:01,443
What on earth happened?

49
00:02:01,443 --> 00:02:02,676
- So... / - That means...

50
00:02:02,676 --> 00:02:04,043
Let's send them on a trip.

51
00:02:04,043 --> 00:02:05,343
- To a country of meat. / - She said she'd go.

52
00:02:05,343 --> 00:02:07,743
Jooe is willing to go anywhere.

53
00:02:07,743 --> 00:02:08,710
- Really? / - She just wants meat.

54
00:02:10,376 --> 00:02:11,776
- I can go anywhere. / - Where?

55
00:02:11,776 --> 00:02:13,710
- Where do you want to go? / - Be honest.

56
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:16,510
First of all, Suncheon.

57
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:17,843
- I want to go there. / - Suncheon?

58
00:02:17,843 --> 00:02:18,643
- You have to go there. / - Gwangyang?

59
00:02:18,643 --> 00:02:20,876
- Then, Busan. / - Busan.

60
00:02:20,876 --> 00:02:23,176
- Busan is nice. / - I only went there for functions.

61
00:02:23,176 --> 00:02:25,376
- I've never had fun in Busan. / - Busan is nice.

62
00:02:25,376 --> 00:02:26,576
- Busan... / - Busan is really nice.

63
00:02:26,576 --> 00:02:29,510
You should ask him about good restaurants in Busan.

64
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:31,876
Nampo-dong is a good place to visit.

65
00:02:31,876 --> 00:02:34,143
If you like beaches, Haeundae and Gwangalli.

66
00:02:34,143 --> 00:02:36,676
OST, octopus, shrimp, tripe in Seomyeon...

67
00:02:36,676 --> 00:02:37,410
I know.

68
00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:38,376
I know, I know.

69
00:02:39,643 --> 00:02:40,543
What was that?

70
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:42,876
Mina knows.

71
00:02:42,876 --> 00:02:44,110
Mina knows what it is.

72
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:45,376
She's had it.

73
00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:47,943
And Jagalchi Market.

74
00:02:48,976 --> 00:02:50,376
OST...

75
00:02:50,376 --> 00:02:51,443
Okay.

76
00:02:51,443 --> 00:02:53,943
Today's theme of Battle Trip is

77
00:02:53,943 --> 00:02:57,510
the spring flower trip of 20-year-olds.

78
00:02:57,510 --> 00:03:00,510
The judges today are all 20-year-olds as well.

79
00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:02,776
And we surveyed them and asked...

80
00:03:02,776 --> 00:03:05,443
- Where they want to go when they're 20. / - Right.

81
00:03:05,443 --> 00:03:07,110
And no explanation is required.

82
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:08,176
It's the top place.

83
00:03:08,176 --> 00:03:10,276
Jeju-do was no. 1.

84
00:03:10,276 --> 00:03:12,143
It means they haven't been to Jeju-do yet.

85
00:03:12,143 --> 00:03:13,343
Who hasn't been to Jeju-do yet?

86
00:03:13,343 --> 00:03:14,543
Jeju-do.

87
00:03:14,543 --> 00:03:15,743
- There are many. / - Quite a lot.

88
00:03:15,743 --> 00:03:18,010
Then, Busan was no. 2.

89
00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:19,476
Then it was Jeonju.

90
00:03:19,476 --> 00:03:20,910
Jeonju has become a lot more popular.

91
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:22,143
You're right.

92
00:03:22,143 --> 00:03:24,910
What do you think they wanted to do the most?

93
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:26,010
What was it?

94
00:03:26,010 --> 00:03:27,710
They're at the age when they can eat the most.

95
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:28,810
They have to eat.

96
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:30,176
- It's an eating show. / - It is.

97
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:31,776
They're at an age when they have the best metabolism.

98
00:03:32,876 --> 00:03:35,610
And I don't really understand this one

99
00:03:35,610 --> 00:03:36,910
but taking photos.

100
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:37,910
These days...

101
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:38,510
Look how happy she is.

102
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:40,676
You have to get take photo of a lifetime.

103
00:03:40,676 --> 00:03:43,543
You must get at least one on a trip.

104
00:03:43,543 --> 00:03:44,943
Do you like photos that much?

105
00:03:44,943 --> 00:03:46,143
Yes.

106
00:03:46,143 --> 00:03:47,310
I hated it.

107
00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:51,876
And there are activities and extreme sports.

108
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:54,710
Something thrilling, right?

109
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:55,976
Did you expend some energy?

110
00:03:55,976 --> 00:03:58,010
We expended a lot of energy.

111
00:03:58,010 --> 00:03:59,243
We flew in the sky.

112
00:03:59,243 --> 00:04:01,143
You flew in the sky?

113
00:04:01,143 --> 00:04:02,443
I can't wait to see that.

114
00:04:02,443 --> 00:04:04,243
Is there anyone here

115
00:04:04,243 --> 00:04:06,276
who wants to go on a trip with someone else?

116
00:04:06,276 --> 00:04:09,676
I know it's good to go on a trip with someone.

117
00:04:09,676 --> 00:04:11,676
- Alone? / - But traveling alone...

118
00:04:11,676 --> 00:04:13,310
Is also nice.

119
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:14,543
It's quite fun.

120
00:04:14,543 --> 00:04:16,643
- He has a point there. / - Right.

121
00:04:16,643 --> 00:04:18,410
It's different from a trip with someone.

122
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:20,243
Where do you want to travel alone?

123
00:04:20,243 --> 00:04:22,410
There's something I've always wanted to try.

124
00:04:23,276 --> 00:04:24,476
I've done pretty much everything,

125
00:04:24,476 --> 00:04:26,710
but I haven't tried skydiving in Australia.

126
00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:28,243
What do you mean you've done everything?

127
00:04:28,243 --> 00:04:29,876
You've done bungee jumping and everything else?

128
00:04:29,876 --> 00:04:30,710
Bungee jumping...

129
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:32,876
I enjoy jumping out of planes

130
00:04:32,876 --> 00:04:35,076
in a parachute.

131
00:04:35,076 --> 00:04:36,676
Why does it have to be Australia?

132
00:04:36,676 --> 00:04:38,243
I heard Australia

133
00:04:38,243 --> 00:04:40,943
is famous for skydiving.

134
00:04:40,943 --> 00:04:42,310
They have fine views there.

135
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:42,976
I want to try it in Australia.

136
00:04:42,976 --> 00:04:44,310
We'll give you a call

137
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:45,943
next time we go to Australia.

138
00:04:45,943 --> 00:04:47,010
Oh, yes. Thank you.

139
00:04:47,010 --> 00:04:48,743
Oh, yes!

140
00:04:48,743 --> 00:04:50,643
Jihoon is a true man.

141
00:04:51,443 --> 00:04:53,110
What about you, Mina and Yoojung?

142
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:54,510
We would...

143
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:56,043
- Like the... / - Two of us...

144
00:04:56,043 --> 00:04:58,376
- Us two again. / - Another trip together.

145
00:04:58,376 --> 00:05:00,776
What about overseas trips? Where do you want to go?

146
00:05:00,776 --> 00:05:02,810
I'd like to...

147
00:05:02,810 --> 00:05:04,610
If I could go overseas,

148
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:06,410
A hot spring trip

149
00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:09,410
in Sapporo or Osaka.

150
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:10,543
- Hot spring trips are amazing. / - Hot springs.

151
00:05:10,543 --> 00:05:12,610
She's a mature 20-year-old.

152
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:14,076
- A hot spring trip isn't easy. / - She loves them.

153
00:05:14,076 --> 00:05:16,443
After enjoying the hot spring,

154
00:05:16,443 --> 00:05:18,276
I want to drink some dark beer.

155
00:05:20,010 --> 00:05:21,776
- A glass of beer? / - Have a glass of beer...

156
00:05:21,776 --> 00:05:23,210
It's a dream of mine.

157
00:05:23,210 --> 00:05:25,610
A hot spring in the snow...

158
00:05:25,610 --> 00:05:27,943
- That's the best. / - You have to try it.

159
00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:29,610
My gosh.

160
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:33,410
It has become the talk of the town.

161
00:05:33,410 --> 00:05:35,810
A shower with cherry blossoms.

162
00:05:35,810 --> 00:05:37,243
It's time to check out the Hadong trip.

163
00:05:37,243 --> 00:05:38,176
A cherry blossom shower.

164
00:05:38,176 --> 00:05:40,843
The fact that they showered in cherry blossoms...

165
00:05:40,843 --> 00:05:42,110
That's the quintessential expression.

166
00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:43,810
I feel pretty confident.

167
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:46,543
One of the most beautiful things on camera...

168
00:05:46,543 --> 00:05:48,143
- Are cherry blossoms. / - That's right.

169
00:05:48,143 --> 00:05:50,343
I think they would've taken some amazing photos.

170
00:05:50,343 --> 00:05:51,710
There are many people who are too busy

171
00:05:51,710 --> 00:05:53,476
to go and see cherry blossoms these days.

172
00:05:53,476 --> 00:05:54,243
Vicarious satisfaction.

173
00:05:54,243 --> 00:05:57,143
Because of the strong winds, all the flowers fell.

174
00:05:57,143 --> 00:05:59,643
- Lots of people didn't get good photos. / - Right.

175
00:05:59,643 --> 00:06:01,710
But you can enjoy them here right now.

176
00:06:01,710 --> 00:06:03,676
The Yeouido cherry blossom festival was too short.

177
00:06:03,676 --> 00:06:04,910
That's right. It ended too soon.

178
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:06,743
The actual cherry blossom festival is over, right?

179
00:06:06,743 --> 00:06:10,076
There are a lot of flowers other than cherry blossoms.

180
00:06:10,076 --> 00:06:11,243
Right now...

181
00:06:11,243 --> 00:06:13,443
- With May... / - It's coming up.

182
00:06:13,443 --> 00:06:14,643
It's the month of festivals.

183
00:06:14,643 --> 00:06:16,943
There's a poppy festival in Hadong in May.

184
00:06:18,543 --> 00:06:20,443
And there are seasonal foods

185
00:06:20,443 --> 00:06:23,210
you can only eat now.

186
00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:24,476
There's the lamellated oyster.

187
00:06:24,476 --> 00:06:25,110
Lamellated oyster?

188
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:26,776
- Do you know what it is? / - Lamellated oyster...

189
00:06:26,776 --> 00:06:29,076
They're these huge oysters...

190
00:06:29,076 --> 00:06:30,276
That grow where the river and ocean meet.

191
00:06:30,276 --> 00:06:30,743
That's right.

192
00:06:30,743 --> 00:06:32,576
- They have a strong flavor. / - Oysters?

193
00:06:32,576 --> 00:06:33,443
Oysters.

194
00:06:33,443 --> 00:06:35,843
- I'm sure they'll eat it. / - Lamellated oysters.

195
00:06:35,843 --> 00:06:37,576
Just be surprised and press the button.

196
00:06:38,743 --> 00:06:40,410
Lamellated oysters and marsh clams.

197
00:06:40,410 --> 00:06:41,343
- Marsh clams. / - Marsh clams!

198
00:06:41,343 --> 00:06:42,776
- Marsh clams. / - They're really good.

199
00:06:42,776 --> 00:06:44,143
- They're delicious. / - So good.

200
00:06:44,143 --> 00:06:45,676
Marsh clam fritters and soup.

201
00:06:45,676 --> 00:06:47,776
I rarely sweat when I eat

202
00:06:47,776 --> 00:06:49,776
but I showered in sweat when I ate it.

203
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:52,976
They remove the toxins from your body.

204
00:06:52,976 --> 00:06:54,576
You had a shower after eating marsh clams?

205
00:06:54,576 --> 00:06:55,643
From what I can see,

206
00:06:55,643 --> 00:06:57,776
Woojin just likes to shower.

207
00:06:58,476 --> 00:07:00,443
Cherry blossom shower. Marsh clam shower.

208
00:07:01,476 --> 00:07:03,976
Lots of seasonal foods and cherry blossoms.

209
00:07:03,976 --> 00:07:05,710
Woojin, how do you get to Hadong?

210
00:07:05,710 --> 00:07:08,010
Compared to Suncheon,

211
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:10,543
Hadong isn't an easy place to get to.

212
00:07:10,543 --> 00:07:12,510
You can take a direct express bus

213
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:14,376
from Seoul to Hadong.

214
00:07:15,276 --> 00:07:17,710
It takes about 3 hours and 45 minutes

215
00:07:17,710 --> 00:07:18,910
to get there.

216
00:07:18,910 --> 00:07:21,243
But we wanted to take a train,

217
00:07:21,243 --> 00:07:23,776
so we went to Jinju before going to Hadong.

218
00:07:23,776 --> 00:07:25,143
- I see. / - That sounds nice.

219
00:07:25,143 --> 00:07:27,043
Please don't tell me

220
00:07:27,043 --> 00:07:28,843
you just left Jinju without doing anything.

221
00:07:28,843 --> 00:07:30,110
- Of course not. / - Of course.

222
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:32,810
I'm from Masan myself but there were a lot of

223
00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:34,643
local delicacies of Jinju I hadn't tried.

224
00:07:35,476 --> 00:07:37,143
You'll see.

225
00:07:37,143 --> 00:07:38,976
I think the viewers should

226
00:07:38,976 --> 00:07:41,076
boil water for some instant noodles

227
00:07:41,076 --> 00:07:42,410
before watching our trip.

228
00:07:42,410 --> 00:07:43,110
I see.

229
00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:45,210
It means we can't watch it on an empty stomach.

230
00:07:45,210 --> 00:07:48,843
- It's dangerous to do that. / - Have some carrots.

231
00:07:48,843 --> 00:07:49,543
Carrots?

232
00:07:49,543 --> 00:07:50,543
He says it dangerous...

233
00:07:50,543 --> 00:07:52,110
- On an empty stomach. / - It's dangerous.

234
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:53,310
I can't wait.

235
00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:56,943
From what I can see,

236
00:07:56,943 --> 00:07:59,176
they went on the best flower trip possible.

237
00:07:59,176 --> 00:08:00,576
Nothing could be better.

238
00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:03,076
- Let's watch it together then. / - Let's do that.

239
00:08:03,076 --> 00:08:04,576
- Can you shout your team name? / - Go on.

240
00:08:04,576 --> 00:08:05,176
Ready, go.

241
00:08:05,176 --> 00:08:05,976
- Pink. / - Sausage.

242
00:08:05,976 --> 00:08:06,876
- Team. / - Cross!

243
00:08:06,876 --> 00:08:09,843
Let's watch our spring flower trip of 20-year-olds.

244
00:08:14,943 --> 00:08:15,976
- For real? / - We've won.

245
00:08:15,976 --> 00:08:17,710
- Is this CG or what? / - Oh, CG...

246
00:08:18,743 --> 00:08:19,810
Isn't this CG?

247
00:08:19,810 --> 00:08:21,010
Not at all.

248
00:08:21,010 --> 00:08:21,910
We've won.

249
00:08:21,910 --> 00:08:23,310
It's an actual shower.

250
00:08:23,310 --> 00:08:25,143
- I said it was a shower. / - It's so beautiful.

251
00:08:26,910 --> 00:08:28,176
Hurrah!

252
00:08:29,976 --> 00:08:31,843
- I thought it was snow. / - This is incredible.

253
00:08:31,843 --> 00:08:33,643
It's like someone's pouring it on you.

254
00:08:37,443 --> 00:08:38,543
All I want to do, Wanna One.

255
00:08:38,543 --> 00:08:39,443
Hello.

256
00:08:39,443 --> 00:08:40,443
I'm Park Jihoon of Wanna One.

257
00:08:40,443 --> 00:08:41,443
I'm Park Woojin of Wanna One.

258
00:08:42,576 --> 00:08:44,776
(Top 11-member group, Wanna One)

259
00:08:45,310 --> 00:08:48,310
(Jihoon and Woojin are 20 years old, born in 1999)

260
00:08:50,743 --> 00:08:51,610
Those angles...

261
00:08:53,376 --> 00:08:54,343
Save in my heart.

262
00:08:55,176 --> 00:08:56,110
We're finally

263
00:08:56,110 --> 00:08:58,010
on Battle Trip to celebrate

264
00:08:58,010 --> 00:08:59,510
the age of 20.

265
00:09:00,776 --> 00:09:02,810
(Welcome, Wanna One)

266
00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:04,543
I'm so glad.

267
00:09:05,376 --> 00:09:06,843
Actually, I haven't

268
00:09:06,843 --> 00:09:09,976
traveled a lot.

269
00:09:09,976 --> 00:09:12,076
I haven't even been on many family trips.

270
00:09:12,076 --> 00:09:12,776
Not even once?

271
00:09:12,776 --> 00:09:13,676
Really?

272
00:09:13,676 --> 00:09:14,376
Yes.

273
00:09:14,376 --> 00:09:16,510
I don't know much if it's not my neighborhood.

274
00:09:17,243 --> 00:09:19,043
This trip with you is my first time.

275
00:09:19,043 --> 00:09:20,443
This trip with you is my first time.

276
00:09:21,343 --> 00:09:22,876
(He feels a lot of pressure)

277
00:09:23,243 --> 00:09:24,976
Do you have a dream when you go on a trip?

278
00:09:24,976 --> 00:09:25,943
It's his first trip.

279
00:09:25,943 --> 00:09:28,343
My dream is

280
00:09:28,343 --> 00:09:30,310
to watch the stars at night.

281
00:09:31,710 --> 00:09:33,043
Have a barbecue

282
00:09:33,043 --> 00:09:34,610
and talk about things.

283
00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:35,376
What about you?

284
00:09:36,243 --> 00:09:37,476
- My dream? / - Yes.

285
00:09:37,476 --> 00:09:40,376
Not really a dream but something I've always liked.

286
00:09:41,010 --> 00:09:41,576
What is it?

287
00:09:41,576 --> 00:09:43,376
I...

288
00:09:43,376 --> 00:09:44,776
Want to go to Hawaii.

289
00:09:44,776 --> 00:09:45,910
Want to go to Hawaii.

290
00:09:47,143 --> 00:09:47,676
Hawaii.

291
00:09:47,676 --> 00:09:48,943
It's my dream since I was little.

292
00:09:48,943 --> 00:09:50,343
- Going to Hawaii? / - I dreamed of being...

293
00:09:50,343 --> 00:09:51,410
At the blue ocean of Hawaii.

294
00:09:51,410 --> 00:09:53,343
Like on Waikiki beach?

295
00:09:53,343 --> 00:09:55,776
The concept of this trip is...

296
00:09:55,776 --> 00:09:59,543
Spring flower trip of 20-year-olds.

297
00:09:59,543 --> 00:10:01,343
In my opinion, to celebrate being 20...

298
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:04,043
The cherry blossom festival will be over soon...

299
00:10:05,710 --> 00:10:07,676
There are lots of places with cherry blossoms.

300
00:10:07,676 --> 00:10:08,943
Gyeongpodae.

301
00:10:09,876 --> 00:10:11,276
There's Gyeongpodae.

302
00:10:11,276 --> 00:10:13,110
Cheongpung Lake, Jecheon?

303
00:10:13,843 --> 00:10:15,676
- Oh, Jecheon. / - There are so many places.

304
00:10:15,676 --> 00:10:17,043
Jeju-do is famous for cherry blossoms.

305
00:10:17,043 --> 00:10:18,276
Jeju-do is very famous.

306
00:10:18,276 --> 00:10:19,376
- It is. / - It's famous for cherry blossoms.

307
00:10:19,376 --> 00:10:20,243
Huge cherry blossoms.

308
00:10:20,243 --> 00:10:21,110
Jinhae.

309
00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:22,943
- Gunhangje is really famous. / - Gunhangje.

310
00:10:22,943 --> 00:10:24,910
Jinhae is really famous for cherry blossoms too.

311
00:10:25,710 --> 00:10:28,110
But these places are too common.

312
00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:30,676
- Let's find a new place. / - That's right.

313
00:10:30,676 --> 00:10:33,710
It'd be good for us to find and share with the viewers.

314
00:10:33,710 --> 00:10:34,710
They're really considerate.

315
00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:37,910
They want to find new places instead of famous ones.

316
00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:41,376
There are so many cherry blossoms here.

317
00:10:42,343 --> 00:10:44,376
It's like a place from a fairy tale.

318
00:10:44,376 --> 00:10:45,976
That's a flower road.

319
00:10:46,876 --> 00:10:47,776
It's like a roof of cherry blossoms.

320
00:10:47,776 --> 00:10:49,510
It's Hwagae, Hadong, Gyeongsangnam-do.

321
00:10:50,543 --> 00:10:52,343
- Which area? / - Gyeongsangnam-do.

322
00:10:52,343 --> 00:10:54,810
There's no direct train to Hadong.

323
00:10:55,476 --> 00:10:57,210
We have to get off at Jinju Station

324
00:10:57,210 --> 00:10:58,710
and take a bus.

325
00:10:58,710 --> 00:10:59,843
I've never been anywhere like this before.

326
00:11:01,143 --> 00:11:01,976
Nice, nice.

327
00:11:01,976 --> 00:11:02,910
Here we go.

328
00:11:03,843 --> 00:11:05,243
This looks so good.

329
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:07,276
(He's not picky about his food)

330
00:11:07,776 --> 00:11:08,843
That looks good.

331
00:11:10,676 --> 00:11:12,076
The view is so amazing.

332
00:11:14,276 --> 00:11:16,510
If you're handsome, you look good even in that.

I look weird.

You look fine.

337
00:11:25,076 --> 00:11:26,776
I'm not trembling because I'm scared.

338
00:11:26,776 --> 00:11:27,976
I'm trembling because I'm cold.

339
00:11:27,976 --> 00:11:28,876
It's too high!

340
00:11:28,876 --> 00:11:29,810
It's way too high here!

It's too high.

343

You look a little strange now.

344
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:35,076
Did I really do that?

345
00:11:36,710 --> 00:11:37,376
It's too high!

346
00:11:37,376 --> 00:11:38,376
It's way too high here!

347
00:11:38,376 --> 00:11:39,443
It's really high! It's really high!

348

It's too high.

349

This is a little...

350
00:11:42,710 --> 00:11:44,110
Do it properly.

351

(Eating with passion)

352
00:11:48,610 --> 00:11:50,543
This is impossible.

Challenge.

360
00:12:04,043 --> 00:12:04,876
They must have gone camping.

00:12:13,176 --> 00:12:16,410
We wore pink sweatsuits.

366
00:12:16,410 --> 00:12:18,610
People said we were really cute.

367
00:12:18,610 --> 00:12:19,976
So Pink Sausage.

368
00:12:19,976 --> 00:12:21,810
- And we're a team so... / - Team.

369
00:12:21,810 --> 00:12:23,643
Pink Sausage Team.

370
00:12:23,643 --> 00:12:25,476
They made a team name for us.

371
00:12:26,043 --> 00:12:28,076
(Cheerful and fresh)

372
00:12:28,076 --> 00:12:30,643
(Pink Sausage Tour)

373
00:12:31,310 --> 00:12:32,076
Let's go, go, go.

374
00:12:32,643 --> 00:12:33,076
Let's go.

375
00:12:33,710 --> 00:12:34,543
Let's go.

376
00:12:38,843 --> 00:12:39,843
Why is he going that way?

377
00:12:42,010 --> 00:12:43,810
(3 hours from Yongsan to Jinju)

378
00:12:44,376 --> 00:12:46,710
(1 hour from Jinju to Hadong by bus)

379
00:12:46,710 --> 00:12:49,110
(Pink Sausage Tour's overnight trip plan)

380
00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:50,976
(1st day in Jinju and Hadong)

381
00:12:50,976 --> 00:12:52,543
(2nd day in Hadong)

382
00:12:53,476 --> 00:12:56,076
We're finally here at Yongsan Station.

383
00:12:56,076 --> 00:12:56,943
Ta-da.

384
00:12:56,943 --> 00:13:00,010
A fan suggested we carry these.

385
00:13:00,010 --> 00:13:00,943
Since it's your first trip...

386
00:13:00,943 --> 00:13:03,243
You need something symbolic like this.

387
00:13:03,243 --> 00:13:04,876
Let's take a photo

388
00:13:04,876 --> 00:13:06,643
since this is our first trip.

389
00:13:06,643 --> 00:13:07,443
Let's start after that.

390
00:13:09,143 --> 00:13:10,843
It takes some time

391
00:13:10,843 --> 00:13:11,810
to get used to the camera.

392
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:15,243
This camera takes really good photos.

393
00:13:16,510 --> 00:13:18,010
1, 2, 3.

394
00:13:21,543 --> 00:13:22,910
- That's good. / - Okay.

395
00:13:24,576 --> 00:13:26,943
It's exciting, their first trip after turning 20.

396
00:13:26,943 --> 00:13:29,343
- Pink Sausage Tour. / - Let's go.

397
00:13:31,743 --> 00:13:32,676
Let's go cheerfully.

398
00:13:33,276 --> 00:13:34,043
Let's go cheerfully.

399
00:13:35,276 --> 00:13:37,943
It's your first time at a station just the two of you, right?

400
00:13:37,943 --> 00:13:39,076
- That's right. / - Isn't that right?

401
00:13:39,076 --> 00:13:41,076
It's my first time coming to a place like this.

402
00:13:41,676 --> 00:13:43,176
I also like these.

403
00:13:43,176 --> 00:13:44,010
Get everything.

404
00:13:44,976 --> 00:13:46,376
Let's start with this happy mood.

405
00:13:47,243 --> 00:13:49,310
The 8:25 a.m. train is heading to Jinju.

406
00:13:50,176 --> 00:13:52,510
- We need to go down here. / - ??We're on a train trip ??

407
00:13:52,510 --> 00:13:53,543
We entered the train.

408
00:13:53,543 --> 00:13:55,376
(They entered the KTX train to Jinju)

409
00:13:56,476 --> 00:13:59,476
Our seats are 2D and 2C.

410
00:14:00,210 --> 00:14:01,210
- Here? / - Yes.

411
00:14:01,876 --> 00:14:03,243
(Excited)

412
00:14:03,243 --> 00:14:04,776
What is it like for only the two of you to travel?

413
00:14:04,776 --> 00:14:06,010
Didn't it feel empty?

414
00:14:06,010 --> 00:14:07,543
Since you're always in a large group.

415
00:14:07,543 --> 00:14:08,776
- Yes, two of us... / - Right. Because...

416
00:14:08,776 --> 00:14:11,343
Normally, it's loud and crowded but it was just us two.

417
00:14:11,343 --> 00:14:12,710
- You relied on each other. / - That's right.

418
00:14:13,610 --> 00:14:15,076
It's going, going, going, going.

419
00:14:16,843 --> 00:14:18,143
It's moving.

420
00:14:18,143 --> 00:14:19,243
Is this the front?

421
00:14:19,243 --> 00:14:20,176
Yeah, this is the front.

422
00:14:20,176 --> 00:14:21,076
- Really? / - Yeah.

423
00:14:21,076 --> 00:14:22,710
- That means we're going backwards. / - Yeah.

424
00:14:22,710 --> 00:14:23,976
I see.

425
00:14:24,676 --> 00:14:25,776
Good, good.

426
00:14:25,776 --> 00:14:26,743
Here we go.

427
00:14:31,243 --> 00:14:31,843
Congratulations.

428
00:14:31,843 --> 00:14:32,576
First love.

429
00:14:34,643 --> 00:14:36,910
Good restaurants in Jinju.

430
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:38,776
We have to type in "good restaurants."

431
00:14:39,843 --> 00:14:42,476
How about cold noodles for lunch?

432
00:14:42,476 --> 00:14:43,276
There's one.

433
00:14:44,776 --> 00:14:46,310
(Wow)

434
00:14:46,310 --> 00:14:47,576
That's a big serving.

435
00:14:47,576 --> 00:14:49,476
It's a seafood broth.

436
00:14:49,476 --> 00:14:50,676
I've never seen that before.

437
00:14:51,543 --> 00:14:52,776
Mixed cold noodles.

438
00:14:52,776 --> 00:14:54,643
That really looks good.

439
00:14:54,643 --> 00:14:55,943
Meat fritters!

440
00:14:56,710 --> 00:14:57,843
(The women go crazy)

441
00:14:57,843 --> 00:14:59,943
- Wow, meat fritters! / - You eat it with meat fritters.

442
00:14:59,943 --> 00:15:02,010
I really like meat fritters.

443
00:15:03,676 --> 00:15:05,410
The meat fritters...

444
00:15:05,410 --> 00:15:07,376
- They had that. / - Look at that meat.

445
00:15:07,376 --> 00:15:08,910
(Let's go to eat Jinju cold noodles)

446
00:15:09,776 --> 00:15:11,210
Let's grab a taxi.

447
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:12,143
Hello.

448
00:15:12,143 --> 00:15:13,676
- Hello. / - Hello.

449
00:15:13,676 --> 00:15:14,843
(It's their first time riding a taxi together)

450
00:15:17,143 --> 00:15:18,176
Look at the flowers.

451
00:15:18,976 --> 00:15:22,476
??The day that cherry blossoms were falling ??

452
00:15:23,176 --> 00:15:25,410
??We went on a trip ??

453
00:15:25,410 --> 00:15:27,343
You can't help but sing

454
00:15:27,343 --> 00:15:28,876
because you're excited.

455
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:31,843
- This place was the best. / - It already smells good.

456
00:15:31,843 --> 00:15:33,810
I can already smell the cold noodles.

457
00:15:37,276 --> 00:15:38,676
Oh, my.

458
00:15:38,676 --> 00:15:39,910
It's served like green onion fritters.

459
00:15:39,910 --> 00:15:40,876
- You're right. / - The meat fritters.

460
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:45,943
(Smacking their lips as they read the menu)

461
00:15:45,943 --> 00:15:47,610
They have beef tartare.

462
00:15:47,610 --> 00:15:49,543
Meat fritters.

463
00:15:49,543 --> 00:15:50,576
Just order everything.

464
00:15:50,576 --> 00:15:53,110
- They went all the way there. / - Just order everything.

465
00:15:53,110 --> 00:15:54,943
- We'll pay for you. / - Order everything.

466
00:15:56,276 --> 00:15:57,176
Let's eat this.

467
00:15:58,210 --> 00:15:59,376
Order it if you can eat it.

468
00:16:00,576 --> 00:16:02,043
One cold noodles, one mixed noodles,

469
00:16:02,043 --> 00:16:03,310
one beef tartare, one meat fritters.

470
00:16:03,310 --> 00:16:04,576
You're going to pay anyway.

471
00:16:04,576 --> 00:16:05,143
What?

472
00:16:05,143 --> 00:16:06,876
Where does that confidence come from?

473
00:16:07,676 --> 00:16:10,376
This is quite expensive though.

474
00:16:10,376 --> 00:16:12,376
What about this then?

475
00:16:12,376 --> 00:16:14,543
Since we're eating traditional Korean food,

476
00:16:14,543 --> 00:16:15,876
let's not use English.

477
00:16:15,876 --> 00:16:17,010
That's difficult.

478
00:16:17,010 --> 00:16:17,776
- Because... / - Right.

479
00:16:17,776 --> 00:16:19,410
- More than you think. / - Things like cola...

480
00:16:19,410 --> 00:16:20,476
There are so many English words we use.

481
00:16:20,476 --> 00:16:23,443
Even "cup" is English.

482
00:16:23,443 --> 00:16:25,476
- I saw something earlier. / - Yeah.

483
00:16:26,343 --> 00:16:29,576
Aristocrats from Hanyang came here to eat this.

484
00:16:29,576 --> 00:16:32,876
That's how famous

485
00:16:32,876 --> 00:16:34,443
Jinju cold noodles are.

486
00:16:36,510 --> 00:16:37,110
It's here.

487
00:16:38,710 --> 00:16:39,810
(Wow)

488
00:16:40,343 --> 00:16:42,476
- It's the beef tartare. / - Look at that serving size.

489
00:16:46,210 --> 00:16:48,010
(The beef tartare makes you exclaim automatically)

490
00:16:48,276 --> 00:16:49,376
The beef fritters.

491
00:16:49,376 --> 00:16:51,676
If you eat the beef fritters with the cold noodles,

492
00:16:51,676 --> 00:16:52,910
they taste better.

493
00:16:54,710 --> 00:16:57,076
That's such a huge serving of beef tartare.

494
00:16:57,076 --> 00:16:59,376
The beef fritters...

495
00:16:59,376 --> 00:17:01,810
Dip them in these sauces...

496
00:17:01,810 --> 00:17:02,976
Sauces...

497
00:17:03,943 --> 00:17:04,710
- Sauce! / - Soy sauce.

498
00:17:04,710 --> 00:17:06,410
He just said "sauce."

499
00:17:06,410 --> 00:17:07,176
He said it.

500
00:17:08,143 --> 00:17:09,176
He said it.

501
00:17:09,176 --> 00:17:10,043
(Confused)

502
00:17:10,510 --> 00:17:11,843
Congratulations, you're paying.

503
00:17:12,410 --> 00:17:13,410
What is this again?

504
00:17:14,043 --> 00:17:15,576
(He finally realizes now)

505
00:17:16,076 --> 00:17:17,576
1:0, 1:0.

506
00:17:17,576 --> 00:17:18,976
I was just trying to tell you something.

507
00:17:21,776 --> 00:17:23,410
I feel wronged so let me continue.

508
00:17:23,943 --> 00:17:26,010
- Okay. / - The soy sauce isn't very salty...

509
00:17:26,010 --> 00:17:27,776
So you can dip a lot into it.

510
00:17:27,776 --> 00:17:29,210
- Okay. / - He's angry.

511
00:17:30,576 --> 00:17:31,743
He's angry for real.

512
00:17:32,910 --> 00:17:34,043
Let's get it.

513
00:17:34,043 --> 00:17:35,110
Let's get it.

514
00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:35,776
Seriously...

515
00:17:35,776 --> 00:17:36,576
Let's get it.

516
00:17:37,776 --> 00:17:39,010
Let's get it.

517
00:17:39,010 --> 00:17:41,043
Thank you, Woojin.

518
00:17:41,876 --> 00:17:44,010
So the score...

519
00:17:44,010 --> 00:17:44,610
Score?

520
00:17:45,243 --> 00:17:46,610
Oh, right!

521
00:17:46,610 --> 00:17:48,276
Score, score, score.

522
00:17:49,676 --> 00:17:51,476
You saved me.

523
00:17:52,043 --> 00:17:52,843
Let's eat.

524
00:17:55,176 --> 00:17:56,976
That looks so good.

525
00:17:57,610 --> 00:17:59,243
I'll have to eat meat fritters today.

526
00:17:59,243 --> 00:18:00,210
Let's do that.

527
00:18:00,210 --> 00:18:02,543
- Today's dinner is meat fritters. / - Dip it in soy sauce.

528
00:18:09,176 --> 00:18:11,210
(Eyes widen)

529
00:18:11,210 --> 00:18:12,543
It made his eyes widen.

530
00:18:13,943 --> 00:18:16,643
That's a really fancy dish.

531
00:18:16,643 --> 00:18:19,576
- Only the aristocrats ate it in the past. / - That's right.

532
00:18:19,576 --> 00:18:22,176
This is the round meat.

533
00:18:22,176 --> 00:18:23,376
Round meat.

534
00:18:23,376 --> 00:18:25,443
This is great

535
00:18:25,443 --> 00:18:26,676
but try the beef tartare.

536
00:18:26,676 --> 00:18:27,976
- How is it? / - This is so...

537
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:32,610
It's so...

538
00:18:34,476 --> 00:18:35,443
There's something different about it, right?

539
00:18:36,910 --> 00:18:37,776
Look at this.

540
00:18:46,610 --> 00:18:47,810
It's melting in my mouth.

541
00:18:49,310 --> 00:18:50,776
Should we dig in now?

542
00:18:50,776 --> 00:18:51,843
Okay.

543
00:18:51,843 --> 00:18:53,210
The servings are so big.

544
00:18:56,210 --> 00:18:57,310
The meat...

545
00:18:58,276 --> 00:18:59,276
It's so big.

546
00:19:02,776 --> 00:19:04,710
- Amazing. / - There's meat fritters in it.

547
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:06,176
- That's right. / - It's in the noodles.

548
00:19:06,176 --> 00:19:07,510
You wrap it with the cold noodles.

549
00:19:07,510 --> 00:19:09,476
There were so much meat fritters in it.

550
00:19:09,476 --> 00:19:10,843
Isn't that banquet noodles?

551
00:19:10,843 --> 00:19:12,943
- If you just order the cold noodles... / - It's so good.

552
00:19:12,943 --> 00:19:14,243
- That's enough, right? / - Right.

553
00:19:14,243 --> 00:19:15,276
They have the meat fritters and...

554
00:19:15,276 --> 00:19:16,276
- Let's go! / - Inside...

555
00:19:16,276 --> 00:19:17,076
- Let's do this. / - Let's go.

556
00:19:17,076 --> 00:19:18,176
Let's do it!

557
00:19:25,876 --> 00:19:27,443
Are the cold noodles

558
00:19:27,443 --> 00:19:29,443
Hamheung style or Pyeongyang style?

559
00:19:29,443 --> 00:19:30,543
Neither.

560
00:19:30,543 --> 00:19:31,410
It's neither?

561
00:19:31,410 --> 00:19:33,043
I've never tasted cold noodles like that before.

562
00:19:33,710 --> 00:19:36,343
You can taste seafood in the broth.

563
00:19:36,343 --> 00:19:37,510
It's true.

564
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:38,943
I saw earlier...

565
00:19:38,943 --> 00:19:40,310
Normally, they just use beef broth

566
00:19:40,310 --> 00:19:43,476
but here, they use seafood broth as well.

567
00:19:43,476 --> 00:19:45,276
It tastes very different.

568
00:19:45,276 --> 00:19:47,410
The toppings here.

569
00:19:47,410 --> 00:19:48,743
They have meat fritters.

570
00:19:49,843 --> 00:19:50,643
You're right.

571
00:19:50,643 --> 00:19:51,810
That'd be so good.

572
00:19:55,510 --> 00:19:57,476
(Jihoon slurps in the mixed cold noodles)

573
00:19:59,176 --> 00:20:00,576
(This is good too)

574
00:20:02,576 --> 00:20:04,810
They're silent because it's so good.

575
00:20:09,543 --> 00:20:11,376
If you have this with the mixed noodles...

576
00:20:12,576 --> 00:20:13,643
(Tip for enjoying Jinju cold noodles)

577
00:20:13,643 --> 00:20:15,310
(Eat them with meat fritters)

578
00:20:17,943 --> 00:20:19,443
Wow, this looks so good.

579
00:20:30,710 --> 00:20:31,676
It really is good.

580
00:20:33,143 --> 00:20:35,476
If I ever come back to Jinju...

581
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:37,476
I'd come back here.

582
00:20:38,110 --> 00:20:39,476
I want to come back to eat this again.

583
00:20:41,076 --> 00:20:42,743
Where will we go after this?

584
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:44,710
After this, we will...

585
00:20:45,976 --> 00:20:47,110
(No English terms are allowed)

586
00:20:47,110 --> 00:20:49,743
(We'll take a bus from the terminal and)

587
00:20:49,743 --> 00:20:52,010
(Take a taxi tour in Hadong to go zip-lining)

588
00:20:52,010 --> 00:20:53,143
Where are we going?

589
00:20:53,143 --> 00:20:53,710
Come on, tell me.

590
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:54,610
Well...

591
00:20:55,210 --> 00:20:57,210
- This is getting frustrating. / - My goodness.

592
00:20:57,876 --> 00:20:59,876
There's this big vehicle that

593
00:20:59,876 --> 00:21:01,743
comes every hour.

594
00:21:01,743 --> 00:21:03,443
We'll get on that vehicle

595
00:21:03,443 --> 00:21:04,843
and go to Hadong, Gyeongsangnam-do.

596
00:21:05,810 --> 00:21:07,476
We'll do something very active.

597
00:21:07,476 --> 00:21:09,576
- And very fun. / - Good, good.

598
00:21:09,576 --> 00:21:11,176
That's what I have planned.

599
00:21:11,176 --> 00:21:12,943
You just need to have fun.

600
00:21:14,210 --> 00:21:16,443
Okay then.

601
00:21:16,443 --> 00:21:18,676
Woojin will pay for the meal.

602
00:21:19,376 --> 00:21:20,310
Congratulations.

603
00:21:21,343 --> 00:21:22,810
I would really like to

604
00:21:22,810 --> 00:21:24,643
help him out.

605
00:21:24,643 --> 00:21:26,343
I realize why they never talked.

606
00:21:26,343 --> 00:21:27,476
- Hey! / - $63...

607
00:21:28,843 --> 00:21:30,310
- The result is... / - Hey!

608
00:21:31,710 --> 00:21:33,643
That was his sneeze?

609
00:21:33,643 --> 00:21:34,776
On purpose...

610
00:21:34,776 --> 00:21:36,843
You did that on purpose, right?

611
00:21:36,843 --> 00:21:37,776
Was that a real sneeze?

612
00:21:37,776 --> 00:21:38,576
That's my real sneeze.

613
00:21:38,576 --> 00:21:40,043
It is?

614
00:21:40,043 --> 00:21:41,376
Let's do a high-five.

615
00:21:41,376 --> 00:21:42,243
Sure.

616
00:21:42,243 --> 00:21:44,210
- High-five. / - You've given up now.

617
00:21:44,210 --> 00:21:46,276
Well, let's go. Let's go.

618
00:21:46,276 --> 00:21:47,210
Let's get it.

619
00:21:47,210 --> 00:21:48,543
Come on, baby. Come on.

620
00:21:48,543 --> 00:21:49,310
Let's go, let's go.

621
00:21:50,276 --> 00:21:52,910
Can you do activities in the sky?

622
00:21:52,910 --> 00:21:54,610
I could never do skydiving

623
00:21:54,610 --> 00:21:55,843
or bungee jumping.

624
00:21:55,843 --> 00:21:57,110
But I'm not scared of the Viking.

625
00:21:57,110 --> 00:21:59,110
Because you have safety gear

626
00:21:59,110 --> 00:22:00,810
and you're sitting down.

627
00:22:00,810 --> 00:22:02,443
Then I'll look for an activity

628
00:22:02,443 --> 00:22:04,643
that you and I

629
00:22:04,643 --> 00:22:05,576
can enjoy together.

630
00:22:06,476 --> 00:22:10,910
(What is the perfectly safe activity Jihoon prepared?)

631
00:22:11,643 --> 00:22:12,876
(She gets the goosebumps)

632
00:22:12,876 --> 00:22:14,776
- That looks so much fun. / - That's scary.

633
00:22:14,776 --> 00:22:15,643
It's scary.

634
00:22:15,643 --> 00:22:16,943
It was really high.

635
00:22:17,976 --> 00:22:21,110
(The zip-line is placed at a dizzying height)

636
00:22:21,776 --> 00:22:23,043
(He's utterly nervous)

637
00:22:23,943 --> 00:22:25,776
(What will happen to Woojin?)

638
00:22:27,043 --> 00:22:28,876
The weather...

639
00:22:28,876 --> 00:22:30,810
It's perfect spring weather.

640
00:22:33,376 --> 00:22:34,876
We're finally here.

641
00:22:34,876 --> 00:22:35,710
Hadong.

642
00:22:35,710 --> 00:22:37,576
But how are we going to get there?

643
00:22:37,576 --> 00:22:39,476
That's why I prepared this.

644
00:22:40,010 --> 00:22:41,443
- What? Taxi? / - I... Yes.

645
00:22:41,443 --> 00:22:43,710
It's not a regular taxi.

646
00:22:43,710 --> 00:22:44,943
This isn't an ordinary taxi.

647
00:22:44,943 --> 00:22:45,810
- It is... / - What is it?

648
00:22:45,810 --> 00:22:47,976
It's a Hadong taxi tour.

649
00:22:47,976 --> 00:22:50,143
It's $40 for 2 hours.

650
00:22:50,143 --> 00:22:50,843
- Really? / - Yes.

651
00:22:50,843 --> 00:22:54,410
He'll take us to our destinations.

652
00:22:54,410 --> 00:22:55,110
There's such a thing?

653
00:22:55,110 --> 00:22:56,710
- There's a taxi tour? / - That's right.

654
00:22:56,710 --> 00:22:57,810
You can call them

655
00:22:57,810 --> 00:23:00,176
but I already booked it online.

656
00:23:00,176 --> 00:23:01,610
If it's $40 for 2 hours, that's so...

657
00:23:01,610 --> 00:23:03,110
- That's really cheap. / - That's cheap.

658
00:23:05,110 --> 00:23:06,843
- Hello. / - Hello.

659
00:23:06,843 --> 00:23:07,876
Hello.

660
00:23:07,876 --> 00:23:08,676
- Hello. / - Let's get going.

661
00:23:08,676 --> 00:23:10,143
- Thank you. / - Thank you.

662
00:23:12,776 --> 00:23:13,510
It's cool in here.

663
00:23:13,510 --> 00:23:14,876
35 years with no accidents.

664
00:23:15,743 --> 00:23:17,510
No accidents for 35 years.

665
00:23:17,510 --> 00:23:19,110
That could be better in a tourist destination.

666
00:23:19,110 --> 00:23:20,710
- Yes. / - Where are you going first?

667
00:23:21,310 --> 00:23:23,676
Please take us to the zip-line on Geumosan.

668
00:23:23,676 --> 00:23:24,976
Okay.

669
00:23:24,976 --> 00:23:26,676
Thank you.

670
00:23:26,676 --> 00:23:27,776
Geumosan zip-line?

671
00:23:27,776 --> 00:23:29,210
Yes.

672
00:23:30,410 --> 00:23:32,143
What's a zip-line?

673
00:23:32,143 --> 00:23:33,243
The zip-line at Geumosan...

674
00:23:34,543 --> 00:23:38,576
The whole route lasts for about 3,200m.

675
00:23:38,576 --> 00:23:40,843
It's the longest zip-line in Asia.

676
00:23:40,843 --> 00:23:42,210
It's the longest in Asia?

677
00:23:43,310 --> 00:23:44,910
The longest in Asia?

678
00:23:44,910 --> 00:23:46,643
- The driver... / - For 2 hours...

679
00:23:46,643 --> 00:23:50,043
- He's lived in Hadong the whole time. / - He explains it?

680
00:23:50,043 --> 00:23:51,710
- He explains. / - He was well-informed.

681
00:23:52,343 --> 00:23:56,176
Hadong is 1 town with 12 townships.

682
00:23:56,176 --> 00:23:59,010
The townships are all clustered around Jirisan.

683
00:23:59,010 --> 00:24:02,576
Hadong is best known for cherry blossoms.

684
00:24:02,576 --> 00:24:04,343
There's a river that runs along.

685
00:24:04,343 --> 00:24:05,276
So different.

686
00:24:05,276 --> 00:24:07,576
Is that a painting or what?

687
00:24:07,576 --> 00:24:09,176
The flowers bloom so beautifully.

688
00:24:10,043 --> 00:24:12,310
It's the most beautiful road in Korea.

689
00:24:12,310 --> 00:24:13,710
The cherry blossoms there are over 100 years old

690
00:24:13,710 --> 00:24:16,910
and from Hwagae Market to Ssanggyesa, for 5km,

691
00:24:16,910 --> 00:24:18,643
they have been preserved as is.

692
00:24:18,643 --> 00:24:20,576
Is it the perfect time to visit now?

693
00:24:20,576 --> 00:24:22,243
It's the peak season right now.

694
00:24:22,243 --> 00:24:23,643
You won't be able to close your mouth.

695
00:24:23,643 --> 00:24:24,776
You'll be like, "Wow."

696
00:24:27,476 --> 00:24:28,176
For the food in Hadong...

697
00:24:28,176 --> 00:24:30,776
Right now, it's marsh clam season.

698
00:24:30,776 --> 00:24:32,776
We're famous for marsh clam soup.

699
00:24:32,776 --> 00:24:35,576
And the lamellated oysters from the river.

700
00:24:35,576 --> 00:24:37,176
- They're from the river. / - So big.

701
00:24:37,176 --> 00:24:39,610
- That's so big. / - The oysters were huge.

702
00:24:39,610 --> 00:24:40,710
And green tea.

703
00:24:41,876 --> 00:24:43,510
These are things you must try

704
00:24:43,510 --> 00:24:44,910
if you visit Hadong.

705
00:24:49,110 --> 00:24:50,843
That's Geumosan.

706
00:24:53,410 --> 00:24:55,643
What do you think? Can you do the zip-line?

707
00:24:56,376 --> 00:24:58,176
I don't know.

708
00:24:58,176 --> 00:25:00,476
It... It's... It's probably high, right?

709
00:25:01,943 --> 00:25:03,043
It's probably not that high.

710
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:04,743
You can do it.

711
00:25:05,610 --> 00:25:07,776
(The zip-line course)

712
00:25:07,776 --> 00:25:11,843
($40 per adult on a weekday)

713
00:25:13,010 --> 00:25:15,243
- 120km? / - 120km per hour?

714
00:25:16,310 --> 00:25:17,776
Check out the view.

715
00:25:19,043 --> 00:25:21,310
(You can see the Dado Sea in Section 3)

716
00:25:22,143 --> 00:25:24,243
(First, they weigh you)

717
00:25:24,243 --> 00:25:25,576
Why? Why do they take your weight?

718
00:25:25,576 --> 00:25:29,543
The safety gear differs depending on your weight.

719
00:25:29,543 --> 00:25:31,276
Sook, you can't measure your weight?

720
00:25:31,276 --> 00:25:32,476
I won't ride it.

721
00:25:34,143 --> 00:25:35,810
It's not about the actual figure.

722
00:25:35,810 --> 00:25:37,643
It's shows L, XL,

723
00:25:37,643 --> 00:25:39,176
S. That's what it shows.

724
00:25:39,176 --> 00:25:40,010
- Oh, really? / - Yes.

725
00:25:40,010 --> 00:25:40,710
It's not the actual number.

726
00:25:40,710 --> 00:25:42,476
- It doesn't tell the numbers. / - Then I can try it.

727
00:25:42,476 --> 00:25:43,610
Then I can weigh myself.

728
00:25:43,610 --> 00:25:44,543
You're right.

729
00:25:44,543 --> 00:25:45,543
Want to go together?

730
00:25:45,543 --> 00:25:46,676
Let's go together.

731
00:25:48,043 --> 00:25:49,376
I can't wait.

732
00:25:49,376 --> 00:25:51,476
- I hear it's really fast. / - Zip-wire.

733
00:25:54,043 --> 00:25:55,010
Just wait.

734
00:25:55,010 --> 00:25:55,910
We're coming.

735
00:25:56,843 --> 00:25:58,843
(They arrive at the top of Geumosan)

736
00:26:01,410 --> 00:26:02,410
No way.

737
00:26:05,243 --> 00:26:06,143
This is amazing.

738
00:26:07,043 --> 00:26:07,910
Great.

739
00:26:10,176 --> 00:26:11,743
- This is scary. / - Let's try this.

740
00:26:15,543 --> 00:26:16,843
I'm nervous.

741
00:26:18,143 --> 00:26:20,276
(They bravely head to the deck where they'll start)

742
00:26:21,410 --> 00:26:22,210
(Wow)

743
00:26:24,110 --> 00:26:25,576
(Jihoon isn't scared at all)

744
00:26:27,376 --> 00:26:28,910
Wow, he's on.

745
00:26:28,910 --> 00:26:30,443
(He's still excited)

746
00:26:32,543 --> 00:26:34,576
Hey, this looks scary.

747
00:26:35,310 --> 00:26:35,976
Look at that.

748
00:26:35,976 --> 00:26:38,376
Isn't it scary with your legs in the air?

749
00:26:38,376 --> 00:26:41,110
(I'm not scared, I'm not scared)

750
00:26:41,443 --> 00:26:42,876
Hey, right now...

751
00:26:44,143 --> 00:26:45,676
I'm no trembling because I'm scared.

752
00:26:45,676 --> 00:26:46,843
It's because I'm cold.

753
00:26:47,876 --> 00:26:49,243
Okay, okay.

754
00:26:49,976 --> 00:26:51,743
This is okay. I can handle this.

755
00:26:51,743 --> 00:26:53,743
- Exactly. This is nothing. / - Okay.

756
00:26:53,743 --> 00:26:54,676
Let's go.

757
00:26:55,676 --> 00:26:57,576
1, 2, 3.

758
00:26:57,576 --> 00:27:00,110
1, 2, 3.

759
00:27:00,110 --> 00:27:00,943
Okay.

760
00:27:00,943 --> 00:27:02,110
Let's go!

761
00:27:02,110 --> 00:27:02,843
Okay.

762
00:27:02,843 --> 00:27:03,843
Let's go!

763
00:27:05,910 --> 00:27:06,876
What's going on?

764
00:27:07,510 --> 00:27:10,676
I thought I was starting but I guess not.

765
00:27:11,510 --> 00:27:12,810
That wasn't the start?

766
00:27:15,743 --> 00:27:16,576
Here we go.

767
00:27:16,576 --> 00:27:17,676
Excuse me?

768
00:27:17,676 --> 00:27:19,376
1, 2, 3.

769
00:27:19,376 --> 00:27:20,110
- What? / - Buckle.

770
00:27:20,776 --> 00:27:21,843
(You startled me)

771
00:27:24,443 --> 00:27:26,843
I didn't hear what he said.

772
00:27:26,843 --> 00:27:28,310
1, 2, 3.

773
00:27:28,310 --> 00:27:29,310
- What? / - Buckle.

774
00:27:29,876 --> 00:27:33,343
(You scared me)

775
00:27:35,443 --> 00:27:36,343
You scared me!

776
00:27:37,176 --> 00:27:38,710
- We're starting now. / - Okay.

777
00:27:38,710 --> 00:27:40,110
Go!

778
00:27:40,110 --> 00:27:41,043
Go!

779
00:27:41,043 --> 00:27:41,810
Is it Jihoon?

780
00:27:42,576 --> 00:27:43,610
- Is it Jihoon? / - 4.

781
00:27:43,610 --> 00:27:44,676
3.

782
00:27:44,676 --> 00:27:45,843
3.

783
00:27:45,843 --> 00:27:46,643
2.

784
00:27:46,643 --> 00:27:47,376
- Let's go. / - 1.

785
00:27:47,376 --> 00:27:48,076
3.

786
00:27:48,076 --> 00:27:48,843
2.

787
00:27:48,843 --> 00:27:50,043
- Let's go. / - 1.

788
00:27:50,043 --> 00:27:51,276
Go!

789
00:27:52,476 --> 00:27:53,910
Go!

790
00:27:57,876 --> 00:27:58,810
- Starting at the same time. / - I heard...

791
00:27:58,810 --> 00:28:00,510
Jihoon was starting first.

792
00:28:02,443 --> 00:28:03,643
Go!

793
00:28:09,843 --> 00:28:11,476
It's so fast.

794
00:28:11,476 --> 00:28:12,676
Wow, that's fast.

795
00:28:13,876 --> 00:28:15,610
(Hooray!)

796
00:28:21,243 --> 00:28:22,676
It really looks fun.

797
00:28:22,676 --> 00:28:24,776
- That looks really fun. / - Here's something to note.

798
00:28:24,776 --> 00:28:26,643
The further you lie back, the faster you go.

799
00:28:26,643 --> 00:28:28,210
If you sit up, you slow down.

800
00:28:28,210 --> 00:28:29,843
I'll have to sit up no matter what.

801
00:28:29,843 --> 00:28:31,043
No, you need to lie back.

802
00:28:33,310 --> 00:28:36,543
(They're having two completely different experiences)

803
00:28:39,643 --> 00:28:41,676
(Jihoon is enjoying the ride)

804
00:28:43,376 --> 00:28:46,176
(Enjoying the scenery and the thrill at the same time)

805
00:28:48,710 --> 00:28:50,310
(Meanwhile, the scared Woojin)

806
00:28:50,310 --> 00:28:52,176
My hair is prickling. It's prickling.

807
00:28:52,176 --> 00:28:53,543
My hair is prickling my face.

808
00:28:57,376 --> 00:28:58,243
Hey, this is awesome.

809
00:28:58,243 --> 00:29:00,543
It's too fast.

810
00:29:00,543 --> 00:29:01,510
What's going on?

811
00:29:03,810 --> 00:29:04,676
What's going on?

812
00:29:08,710 --> 00:29:11,043
(Even their landing reactions are different)

813
00:29:12,810 --> 00:29:14,743
This is so fun.

814
00:29:14,743 --> 00:29:15,810
It's so much fun.

815
00:29:16,976 --> 00:29:17,876
I knew it.

816
00:29:17,876 --> 00:29:19,010
Come down now.

817
00:29:19,010 --> 00:29:19,676
Yes.

818
00:29:19,676 --> 00:29:20,776
Release your grip.

819
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:23,343
(Yelp)

820
00:29:29,143 --> 00:29:29,710
Where am I?

821
00:29:29,710 --> 00:29:30,710
Oh, here.

822
00:29:31,376 --> 00:29:33,976
Mina, Yoojung, are you good with rides?

823
00:29:33,976 --> 00:29:35,743
I love things like this.

824
00:29:35,743 --> 00:29:37,376
- I hate them. / - You do?

825
00:29:38,310 --> 00:29:39,610
I get too scared.

826
00:29:39,610 --> 00:29:41,343
This isn't too bad, right?

827
00:29:41,343 --> 00:29:42,976
I can't even ride the Viking.

828
00:29:42,976 --> 00:29:45,443
- I can't handle the feeling of falling. / - Exactly.

829
00:29:45,443 --> 00:29:46,643
- I just can't... / - You should ride with Sook.

830
00:29:46,643 --> 00:29:48,276
Want to try the Slingshot with me?

831
00:29:48,276 --> 00:29:49,810
Sounds great.

832
00:29:49,810 --> 00:29:51,043
- Do you know what it is? / - I don't.

833
00:29:52,176 --> 00:29:52,843
What's that?

834
00:29:53,710 --> 00:29:58,476
(The Slingshot is incomparable to a zip-line)

835
00:30:00,810 --> 00:30:01,710
What's that?

836
00:30:02,276 --> 00:30:03,910
(It's better that you don't know)

837
00:30:04,476 --> 00:30:05,576
Stretch your legs out.

838
00:30:06,543 --> 00:30:08,276
Okay.

839
00:30:09,043 --> 00:30:09,876
3.

840
00:30:09,876 --> 00:30:10,743
2.

841
00:30:10,743 --> 00:30:11,943
1.

842
00:30:11,943 --> 00:30:12,376
Go.

843
00:30:12,376 --> 00:30:13,876
Pink Sausage Tour!

844
00:30:15,710 --> 00:30:17,010
- Hooray! / - But...

845
00:30:17,010 --> 00:30:18,676
It'd be worth it for the view.

846
00:30:18,676 --> 00:30:20,410
Jihoon got his arms in the air.

847
00:30:20,410 --> 00:30:21,310
It's high. It's so high.

848
00:30:21,310 --> 00:30:22,276
It's so high here.

849
00:30:22,276 --> 00:30:23,343
It's really high up here.

850
00:30:23,343 --> 00:30:24,210
It's so high.

851
00:30:24,876 --> 00:30:26,110
It's too high.

852
00:30:26,110 --> 00:30:27,743
It's really high up here.

853
00:30:29,010 --> 00:30:30,243
You should've tried letting go.

854
00:30:33,510 --> 00:30:34,910
It's too fast. Sit up.

855
00:30:34,910 --> 00:30:37,510
Sit up more. Sit up more.

856
00:30:37,510 --> 00:30:38,276
I'm just so...

857
00:30:38,276 --> 00:30:40,010
(Woojin held onto the line tightly)

858
00:30:41,343 --> 00:30:43,943
(But he succeeds in letting go)

859
00:30:45,176 --> 00:30:46,176
Hooray!

860
00:30:48,576 --> 00:30:49,343
I've let go.

861
00:30:50,110 --> 00:30:51,043
I'm enjoying the view.

862
00:30:56,943 --> 00:30:58,676
(He makes a scene when he lands)

863
00:30:59,843 --> 00:31:01,143
You're starting to enjoy it now,

864
00:31:01,143 --> 00:31:01,843
right?

865
00:31:04,310 --> 00:31:05,410
He looks like a fool.

866
00:31:07,476 --> 00:31:08,743
He's the famous fool at Geumosan.

867
00:31:09,843 --> 00:31:10,543
Geumo fool.

868
00:31:13,510 --> 00:31:16,010
We've completed Section 3.

869
00:31:16,010 --> 00:31:17,543
We've come back after completing the zip-line.

870
00:31:18,210 --> 00:31:19,843
I let go of the line at the end.

871
00:31:20,843 --> 00:31:21,776
You did?

872
00:31:21,776 --> 00:31:23,310
- Yes. / - You really did.

873
00:31:24,210 --> 00:31:26,043
When I let go of the line,

874
00:31:26,043 --> 00:31:27,576
it felt like my body was free falling.

875
00:31:28,443 --> 00:31:30,943
(He reenacts the flapping since he's hyper)

876
00:31:32,876 --> 00:31:35,410
(When he takes off the gear for the zip-line)

877
00:31:36,610 --> 00:31:37,476
Is it my imagination?

878
00:31:37,476 --> 00:31:38,643
- What is it? / - I feel dizzy.

879
00:31:38,643 --> 00:31:39,743
Did your legs go weak?

880
00:31:39,743 --> 00:31:40,510
I'm dizzy.

881
00:31:41,143 --> 00:31:42,510
(Cracking up)

882
00:31:43,376 --> 00:31:44,076
Are you alright?

883
00:31:44,843 --> 00:31:46,376
(Don't talk to me)

884
00:31:46,376 --> 00:31:49,976
Now that I know it's the longest zip-line in Asia,

885
00:31:49,976 --> 00:31:52,110
I do want to try it once.

886
00:31:52,110 --> 00:31:53,210
Right.

887
00:31:53,210 --> 00:31:54,610
How long does it take?

888
00:31:54,610 --> 00:31:57,676
The total distance is 3.2km. It takes about 6 minutes.

889
00:31:57,676 --> 00:31:58,776
6 minutes?

890
00:31:58,776 --> 00:32:00,010
It's really short.

891
00:32:00,810 --> 00:32:02,776
(Day 1 of Pink Sausage Tour)

892
00:32:02,776 --> 00:32:05,510
(Cherry blossom camping)

893
00:32:07,910 --> 00:32:10,543
All long here.

894
00:32:10,543 --> 00:32:12,076
It's like that in Hadong.

895
00:32:13,143 --> 00:32:13,643
Is it all along the road?

896
00:32:13,643 --> 00:32:15,210
Yes, it's around 28 to 30km.

897
00:32:16,176 --> 00:32:17,643
This taxi tour is nice.

898
00:32:17,643 --> 00:32:19,510
He'll wait for you when you get off, right?

899
00:32:19,510 --> 00:32:20,443
That's right.

900
00:32:20,443 --> 00:32:21,276
What the?

901
00:32:21,943 --> 00:32:25,010
(Heart attack)

902
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:26,810
This is the best time of year.

903
00:32:29,243 --> 00:32:30,343
You came at the right time.

904
00:32:30,343 --> 00:32:31,610
We came at the perfect time.

905
00:32:31,610 --> 00:32:32,510
Yes you did.

906
00:32:32,510 --> 00:32:33,510
It's beautiful.

907
00:32:33,510 --> 00:32:35,976
It's nice admiring cherry blossoms in a taxi.

908
00:32:38,743 --> 00:32:40,343
(In no time, the sun sets)

909
00:32:41,310 --> 00:32:42,310
Now, we are...

910
00:32:43,443 --> 00:32:45,076
We have to buy the meat and food.

911
00:32:47,476 --> 00:32:48,576
Here we go.

912
00:32:48,576 --> 00:32:50,210
- We're at the supermarket. / - We're at the mart.

913
00:32:50,210 --> 00:32:51,643
I'm going to

914
00:32:51,643 --> 00:32:54,043
cook for you today.

915
00:32:54,643 --> 00:32:57,976
I've never cooked this on TV.

916
00:32:57,976 --> 00:32:59,510
- Park Woojin's recipe? / - Okay.

917
00:32:59,510 --> 00:33:00,610
I like it.

918
00:33:00,610 --> 00:33:02,043
I'm really good at cooking.

919
00:33:02,910 --> 00:33:04,243
You're good at cooking.

920
00:33:04,243 --> 00:33:06,376
I'm not that good

921
00:33:06,376 --> 00:33:07,676
but I used to cook for myself a lot.

922
00:33:08,910 --> 00:33:10,676
2 packs of pork belly and

923
00:33:10,676 --> 00:33:11,943
1 pack of pork shoulder.

924
00:33:13,776 --> 00:33:15,043
- By the way... / - Yes?

925
00:33:15,043 --> 00:33:17,410
Since it's

926
00:33:17,410 --> 00:33:19,343
our first trip as 20-year-olds...

927
00:33:20,510 --> 00:33:22,843
I mean, we're here on a trip by ourselves.

928
00:33:23,643 --> 00:33:25,143
Soda might not suffice.

929
00:33:26,543 --> 00:33:27,443
It's not enough.

930
00:33:28,843 --> 00:33:30,976
Why don't we get some other beverage?

931
00:33:30,976 --> 00:33:32,343
- Today? / - Yes.

932
00:33:32,343 --> 00:33:33,810
For the first time? Like adults?

933
00:33:33,810 --> 00:33:35,843
Yes, we can get them for the first time like adults.

934
00:33:38,476 --> 00:33:39,643
This feels like...

935
00:33:39,643 --> 00:33:40,710
Can we do this?

936
00:33:40,710 --> 00:33:42,010
I feel like I'm committing a crime.

937
00:33:42,943 --> 00:33:44,243
I wonder if we're allowed to do this.

938
00:33:44,243 --> 00:33:45,176
Then...

939
00:33:45,176 --> 00:33:46,243
I feel like I'm committing a crime.

940
00:33:47,310 --> 00:33:48,576
Let's do this.

941
00:33:48,576 --> 00:33:49,876
You can't drink soju.

942
00:33:49,876 --> 00:33:50,810
Let's go.

943
00:33:50,810 --> 00:33:52,110
You can't even drink soju.

944
00:33:52,843 --> 00:33:54,276
Hold on.

945
00:33:54,276 --> 00:33:56,843
(He puts them back right away)

946
00:33:57,110 --> 00:33:57,976
I think one of these is enough.

947
00:33:57,976 --> 00:33:59,276
I'll have the same one then.

948
00:33:59,810 --> 00:34:00,543
Nice.

949
00:34:01,743 --> 00:34:03,243
Okay. We have our alcohol.

950
00:34:03,243 --> 00:34:04,176
It feels weird.

951
00:34:05,343 --> 00:34:06,376
You bought too much.

952
00:34:06,376 --> 00:34:08,676
Ham and all... That's all included in the expenses.

953
00:34:08,676 --> 00:34:10,776
(Cherry blossoms are in full bloom on their first night)

954
00:34:12,010 --> 00:34:12,776
Welcome.

955
00:34:12,776 --> 00:34:13,843
- Hello. / - Hello.

956
00:34:13,843 --> 00:34:14,943
Hello.

957
00:34:14,943 --> 00:34:15,810
- Come this way. / - Okay.

958
00:34:16,810 --> 00:34:18,076
Hi.

959
00:34:18,076 --> 00:34:18,810
How cute.

960
00:34:19,543 --> 00:34:20,643
He's so cute.

961
00:34:22,343 --> 00:34:23,443
(Wow)

962
00:34:24,976 --> 00:34:25,543
This is it.

963
00:34:25,543 --> 00:34:26,576
Thank you.

964
00:34:26,576 --> 00:34:27,876
Thank you.

965
00:34:27,876 --> 00:34:29,010
(Wow)

966
00:34:29,676 --> 00:34:31,043
Wow, it's nice.

967
00:34:33,476 --> 00:34:35,776
- Goodness. / - That was my first time in a caravan.

968
00:34:35,776 --> 00:34:37,076
Yeah...

969
00:34:37,076 --> 00:34:38,476
This could be better.

970
00:34:38,476 --> 00:34:39,776
Yeah.

971
00:34:39,776 --> 00:34:40,976
Once I get my license,

972
00:34:40,976 --> 00:34:42,443
I'm going to travel in a caravan.

973
00:34:43,843 --> 00:34:45,276
- Great idea. / - Right?

974
00:34:45,276 --> 00:34:46,410
I didn't know it was that nice.

975
00:34:47,910 --> 00:34:50,376
We have knives, spoons, and pots.

976
00:34:50,376 --> 00:34:51,643
It's my first time in a caravan.

977
00:34:51,643 --> 00:34:52,776
Me too.

978
00:34:52,776 --> 00:34:54,743
- I've always wanted to drive one... / - Me too!

979
00:34:55,443 --> 00:34:56,243
Bunk beds?

980
00:34:58,776 --> 00:35:00,310
Should we...

981
00:35:00,310 --> 00:35:02,410
Sleep together in the lower bed?

982
00:35:02,410 --> 00:35:03,376
Hey!

983
00:35:03,376 --> 00:35:04,110
Why?

984
00:35:04,110 --> 00:35:05,076
Hey!

985
00:35:05,076 --> 00:35:05,943
Why?

986
00:35:05,943 --> 00:35:07,876
Why? Why?

987
00:35:07,876 --> 00:35:09,443
His sneezes are so unique.

988
00:35:09,443 --> 00:35:10,676
Do you really sneeze like that?

989
00:35:10,676 --> 00:35:14,810
- He does sound upset. / - It became a habit of mine.

990
00:35:14,810 --> 00:35:15,410
So should we get started?

991
00:35:17,043 --> 00:35:19,376
I'll show you my cooking skills today.

992
00:35:19,910 --> 00:35:22,443
(Chef Park Woojin, the master of survival-cooking)

993
00:35:22,443 --> 00:35:24,310
- Should I address you as Chef Park Woojin? / - Yeah.

994
00:35:24,310 --> 00:35:26,743
(Assistant Park Jihoon, novice chef and traveler)

995
00:35:26,743 --> 00:35:29,043
- Get me a plate. / - Okay.

996
00:35:29,043 --> 00:35:29,843
Yes, chef.

997
00:35:34,210 --> 00:35:35,776
Vongole for table 3.

998
00:35:36,310 --> 00:35:37,743
Vongole for table 3.

999
00:35:38,076 --> 00:35:39,643
- He has another special talent. / - Vongole.

1000
00:35:40,243 --> 00:35:41,476
- Hurry. Move quickly. / - Yes, chef.

1001
00:35:43,543 --> 00:35:44,810
You don't sound like him.

1002
00:35:44,810 --> 00:35:45,976
- I don't? / - No.

1003
00:35:47,910 --> 00:35:48,843
One order of vongole.

1004
00:35:49,510 --> 00:35:50,843
One order of vongole.

1005
00:35:50,843 --> 00:35:52,210
One order of vongole.

1006
00:35:52,210 --> 00:35:53,343
I think I sound like him.

1007
00:35:54,476 --> 00:35:56,943
- We should go out with the ingredients. / - Yeah.

1008
00:35:56,943 --> 00:35:58,510
I feel nervous since it's been a while.

1009
00:35:58,510 --> 00:35:59,976
Why am I getting nervous?

1010
00:36:02,076 --> 00:36:03,510
You can put them right away?

1011
00:36:04,243 --> 00:36:05,376
My gosh, thank you.

1012
00:36:05,376 --> 00:36:06,810
You have a choice.

1013
00:36:06,810 --> 00:36:08,043
Garlic fried rice.

1014
00:36:09,110 --> 00:36:10,343
Or just regular fried rice.

1015
00:36:10,343 --> 00:36:11,343
Garlic fried rice.

1016
00:36:11,343 --> 00:36:12,543
- Garlic? / - Yes.

1017
00:36:12,543 --> 00:36:14,643
I like the smell of garlic.

1018
00:36:15,476 --> 00:36:17,776
I always cook fried rice with garlic.

1019
00:36:18,476 --> 00:36:19,443
And this is...

1020
00:36:19,443 --> 00:36:21,110
That's the proper way to cook.

1021
00:36:21,110 --> 00:36:21,943
And stir-fry the spring onions.

1022
00:36:23,010 --> 00:36:26,243
(Stir-fry them with chopped mushrooms)

1023
00:36:27,443 --> 00:36:29,976
(Put the stir-fried vegetables on a plate for a while)

1024
00:36:32,510 --> 00:36:34,276
I love ham.

1025
00:36:34,276 --> 00:36:36,210
With that much ham,

1026
00:36:36,210 --> 00:36:37,910
it's impossible for it to taste bad.

1027
00:36:43,610 --> 00:36:48,010
(Mix in the egg and stir-fry everything together)

1028
00:36:48,010 --> 00:36:50,210
You have these leftover ingredients at home.

1029
00:36:50,210 --> 00:36:50,910
Right, right.

1030
00:36:50,910 --> 00:36:52,410
You can just cook with them.

1031
00:36:52,410 --> 00:36:53,843
It's delicious.

1032
00:36:53,843 --> 00:36:55,843
Since I like savory food,

1033
00:36:55,843 --> 00:36:56,943
I'll add sesame oil.

1034
00:36:58,543 --> 00:37:00,310
Can you grill the meat?

1035
00:37:01,243 --> 00:37:01,876
What?

1036
00:37:01,876 --> 00:37:03,610
I'm not good at cooking.

1037
00:37:03,610 --> 00:37:05,076
Try for the first time.

1038
00:37:05,076 --> 00:37:05,843
For the first time?

1039
00:37:06,810 --> 00:37:08,343
- Try grilling it by yourself. / - Okay.

1040
00:37:10,343 --> 00:37:12,710
It's hard to grill pork on the charcoals.

1041
00:37:12,710 --> 00:37:14,343
- He has to cook them thoroughly. / - Right.

1042
00:37:14,343 --> 00:37:15,476
He has to cook it right.

1043
00:37:15,476 --> 00:37:17,776
If it's too hard, it's better to grill them in a pan.

1044
00:37:17,776 --> 00:37:18,943
What?

1045
00:37:20,310 --> 00:37:22,110
Hey, give me a minute.

1046
00:37:22,110 --> 00:37:24,776
I haven't even started yet.

1047
00:37:26,710 --> 00:37:27,943
(Flipping)

1048
00:37:30,943 --> 00:37:32,043
You must wait for the right time.

1049
00:37:32,043 --> 00:37:33,176
Not yet. Not yet.

1050
00:37:33,176 --> 00:37:35,810
If you flip too many times, it doesn't taste good.

1051
00:37:35,810 --> 00:37:36,343
Wait.

1052
00:37:39,710 --> 00:37:41,276
(However, he flips it after a short while)

1053
00:37:42,943 --> 00:37:43,876
You're not too bad.

1054
00:37:46,376 --> 00:37:47,410
(When should I cut this?)

1055
00:37:48,776 --> 00:37:50,510
(Glancing)

1056
00:37:50,810 --> 00:37:52,776
- Not yet, not yet. / - It really was your first time.

1057
00:37:54,476 --> 00:37:55,876
It's not time yet.

1058
00:37:56,243 --> 00:37:59,643
(Is it such a hard task to cut the meat at once?)

1059
00:38:02,676 --> 00:38:04,210
(Am I doing this right?)

1060
00:38:05,843 --> 00:38:07,243
You're doing great.

1061
00:38:07,243 --> 00:38:08,410
- Me? / - Yes.

1062
00:38:08,410 --> 00:38:09,443
- Me? / - Yes.

1063
00:38:09,443 --> 00:38:10,210
Right?

1064
00:38:11,743 --> 00:38:12,976
Exactly. I'm good.

1065
00:38:13,643 --> 00:38:14,876
Are you feeling confident now?

1066
00:38:16,443 --> 00:38:17,276
You did a good job.

1067
00:38:17,276 --> 00:38:19,043
- They're cooked nicely. / - Right.

1068
00:38:22,343 --> 00:38:23,843
(He eats one to see if it's cooked)

1069
00:38:23,843 --> 00:38:25,643
How can it not be delicious?

1070
00:38:30,410 --> 00:38:31,576
(Woojin's fried rice is finished)

1071
00:38:32,210 --> 00:38:33,376
That looks delicious.

1072
00:38:33,376 --> 00:38:34,210
It looks so good.

1073
00:38:34,210 --> 00:38:35,776
The color looks nice.

1074
00:38:35,776 --> 00:38:37,576
- That looks so good. / - Today, this is our meal.

1075
00:38:38,876 --> 00:38:39,576
Evaluate my dish.

1076
00:38:41,010 --> 00:38:42,143
Thank you for the food.

1077
00:38:47,010 --> 00:38:48,810
I'm going to be really honest.

1078
00:38:50,576 --> 00:38:52,676
(What's Jihoon's evaluation of the dish?)

1079
00:38:54,376 --> 00:38:55,910
(He's nervous)

1080
00:38:56,510 --> 00:38:58,010
(The fried rice calls for applause)

1081
00:38:58,343 --> 00:38:59,143
This is awesome.

1082
00:38:59,143 --> 00:38:59,976
It's so good.

1083
00:38:59,976 --> 00:39:01,443
- Really? / - Yes, it's really good.

1084
00:39:01,443 --> 00:39:02,210
Great.

1085
00:39:02,210 --> 00:39:03,276
Hold on. This is...

1086
00:39:03,276 --> 00:39:04,176
Are you sure it's good?

1087
00:39:04,576 --> 00:39:06,010
(He takes another spoonful since it's delicious)

1088
00:39:09,010 --> 00:39:10,510
Since it has a lot of ham...

1089
00:39:11,343 --> 00:39:13,243
I thought it'd be salty.

1090
00:39:13,243 --> 00:39:14,810
But it's not salty.

1091
00:39:14,810 --> 00:39:16,676
It's well-seasoned,

1092
00:39:16,676 --> 00:39:17,943
but not greasy.

1093
00:39:17,943 --> 00:39:19,876
Give me an honest score out of 10.

1094
00:39:19,876 --> 00:39:20,610
Be honest.

1095
00:39:21,443 --> 00:39:22,343
Out of 10...

1096
00:39:25,376 --> 00:39:26,043
I give it 10.

1097
00:39:27,276 --> 00:39:28,543
(Oh)

1098
00:39:29,310 --> 00:39:30,376
I want to try that.

1099
00:39:32,843 --> 00:39:34,576
I'd like to try that too.

1100
00:39:37,043 --> 00:39:39,110
You should publish this recipe.

1101
00:39:39,110 --> 00:39:39,910
- Really? / - Yes.

1102
00:39:40,576 --> 00:39:41,343
Success.

1103
00:39:42,510 --> 00:39:43,510
Evaluate my meat.

1104
00:39:43,510 --> 00:39:44,876
(Time to taste the black pork)

1105
00:39:45,743 --> 00:39:47,210
(Nervous)

1106
00:39:47,210 --> 00:39:47,776
How is it?

1107
00:39:48,376 --> 00:39:49,943
- How is it visually? / - It's nice.

1108
00:39:49,943 --> 00:39:51,210
- It looks really nice. / - Right?

1109
00:39:52,710 --> 00:39:55,043
(Munching)

1110
00:39:55,510 --> 00:39:57,376
Black pork is delicious.

1111
00:40:02,543 --> 00:40:04,376
- The meat... / - Yeah?

1112
00:40:04,376 --> 00:40:05,476
Never lets you down.

1113
00:40:06,576 --> 00:40:07,243
Did I do a good job?

1114
00:40:08,310 --> 00:40:09,043
(You did good)

1115
00:40:09,043 --> 00:40:10,110
Really?

1116
00:40:11,976 --> 00:40:13,210
Yours was a success as well.

1117
00:40:13,210 --> 00:40:14,176
It was.

1118
00:40:14,176 --> 00:40:15,543
Gosh, to be honest...

1119
00:40:16,543 --> 00:40:18,143
I was nervous. I really was.

1120
00:40:20,210 --> 00:40:23,110
They eat pork belly with water parsley.

1121
00:40:23,110 --> 00:40:24,143
It's a festival.

1122
00:40:24,143 --> 00:40:25,243
Water parsley.

1123
00:40:25,243 --> 00:40:27,410
Water parsley pork belly is really famous there.

1124
00:40:27,410 --> 00:40:29,076
- How do you eat that? / - Water parsley.

1125
00:40:29,076 --> 00:40:30,443
Hadong, Gyeongsangnam-do style.

1126
00:40:30,443 --> 00:40:31,343
You know, right?

1127
00:40:31,343 --> 00:40:33,376
If it's worth having a festival...

1128
00:40:33,376 --> 00:40:35,343
You wrap meat with water parsley and eat it.

1129
00:40:35,343 --> 00:40:37,210
- With raw water parsley? / - I know this.

1130
00:40:38,376 --> 00:40:40,376
(Straight to his mouth)

1131
00:40:41,676 --> 00:40:42,443
What do you think?

1132
00:40:43,410 --> 00:40:45,710
(It's good)

1133
00:40:45,710 --> 00:40:46,410
What's this?

1134
00:40:47,310 --> 00:40:49,076
(He keeps eating water parsley)

1135
00:40:49,076 --> 00:40:49,676
Are you a goat?

1136
00:40:51,110 --> 00:40:52,376
I love the smell of water parsley.

1137
00:40:54,176 --> 00:40:56,210
- Does it go well with pork belly? / - Really well.

1138
00:40:56,210 --> 00:40:57,276
It makes you healthy.

1139
00:40:57,276 --> 00:40:58,510
- It cleans your blood. / - Right.

1140
00:41:00,276 --> 00:41:02,176
(It suits his taste)

1141
00:41:03,776 --> 00:41:05,110
It doesn't have a strong smell.

1142
00:41:11,276 --> 00:41:12,576
(Mmm)

1143
00:41:13,043 --> 00:41:13,876
I get what you mean.

1144
00:41:14,776 --> 00:41:16,376
I like cooking...

1145
00:41:17,510 --> 00:41:19,510
And grilling meat like this.

1146
00:41:21,176 --> 00:41:22,610
Is it time for the beer?

1147
00:41:22,976 --> 00:41:23,843
Here we go.

1148
00:41:24,710 --> 00:41:26,310
I knew something was missing.

1149
00:41:26,310 --> 00:41:28,476
Anyway, we should finish pork neck.

1150
00:41:30,443 --> 00:41:31,910
Why am I nervous?

1151
00:41:32,643 --> 00:41:34,910
I feel like I'm doing something wrong.

1152
00:41:34,910 --> 00:41:36,276
Gosh. It's alcohol.

1153
00:41:38,276 --> 00:41:39,376
Anyway...

1154
00:41:39,376 --> 00:41:40,976
- We're grownups now. / - We're 20.

1155
00:41:40,976 --> 00:41:42,143
We're grownups.

1156
00:41:42,143 --> 00:41:42,843
Let's open them.

1157
00:41:42,843 --> 00:41:43,476
Go, go.

1158
00:41:43,476 --> 00:41:45,743
(They open the cans)

1159
00:41:47,243 --> 00:41:48,410
Pink Sausage Tour. To us at 20.

1160
00:41:49,710 --> 00:41:51,143
Pink Sausage Tour.

1161
00:41:51,143 --> 00:41:53,543
Cheers to being 20.

1162
00:41:56,743 --> 00:41:58,143
The way he holds the can looks a bit awkward.

1163
00:41:58,143 --> 00:41:59,476
- Right? / - It does.

1164
00:41:59,476 --> 00:42:00,176
It looks a bit awkward.

1165
00:42:01,143 --> 00:42:02,976
So it was your first time traveling,

1166
00:42:02,976 --> 00:42:05,176
camping and having a beer...

1167
00:42:05,176 --> 00:42:07,110
- Everything was a first, right? / - Yes.

1168
00:42:07,110 --> 00:42:08,143
It was our very first time.

1169
00:42:09,443 --> 00:42:10,510
Anyway,

1170
00:42:10,510 --> 00:42:12,676
it's nice that we're camping.

1171
00:42:14,743 --> 00:42:15,710
I feel comfortable.

1172
00:42:16,976 --> 00:42:18,776
There's no...

1173
00:42:19,843 --> 00:42:21,610
Stress.

1174
00:42:21,610 --> 00:42:24,410
We're freely traveling and drinking alcohol

1175
00:42:24,410 --> 00:42:25,276
just the two of us.

1176
00:42:26,676 --> 00:42:27,743
I can't ask for more.

1177
00:42:29,943 --> 00:42:30,643
Hey, look!

1178
00:42:32,510 --> 00:42:33,810
That's amazing.

1179
00:42:33,810 --> 00:42:34,676
Hey.

1180
00:42:36,276 --> 00:42:38,143
That's amazing.

1181
00:42:42,676 --> 00:42:45,376
I was literally speechless just now.

1182
00:42:48,276 --> 00:42:50,643
I can't believe I'm seeing this.

1183
00:42:51,376 --> 00:42:55,776
We're watching the moon rise on our first trip.

1184
00:42:55,776 --> 00:42:56,610
I've never seen something like this.

1185
00:42:56,610 --> 00:42:57,443
I don't know what to say.

1186
00:42:58,476 --> 00:43:00,443
If I climb that mountain,

1187
00:43:00,443 --> 00:43:02,510
I feel like the moon will be right in front of me.

1188
00:43:03,376 --> 00:43:05,243
We picked the right day.

1189
00:43:06,176 --> 00:43:07,110
It looks beautiful.

1190
00:43:09,643 --> 00:43:11,110
I'm really looking forward to tomorrow.

1191
00:43:11,643 --> 00:43:12,376
Challenge.

1192
00:43:12,376 --> 00:43:13,643
- Challenge. / - The moon is beautiful.

1193
00:43:14,376 --> 00:43:16,110
Korea is so nice.

1194
00:43:16,510 --> 00:43:18,343
It's nice to go camping like that.

1195
00:43:21,910 --> 00:43:23,943
So pretty.

1196
00:43:23,943 --> 00:43:25,643
- This is the start. / - Is it the cherry blossom shower?

1197
00:43:26,410 --> 00:43:27,810
They're in full bloom.

1198
00:43:31,076 --> 00:43:33,643
(They wake up in Hadong)

1199
00:43:35,543 --> 00:43:37,743
(It's been a while since they had such a deep sleep)

1200
00:43:38,643 --> 00:43:40,310
It was really warm there.

1201
00:43:40,310 --> 00:43:41,510
It was so...

1202
00:43:41,810 --> 00:43:44,110
(Bedtime is over)

1203
00:43:47,043 --> 00:43:48,376
(Snorting)

1204
00:43:49,276 --> 00:43:50,843
(Look at his hair)

1205
00:43:52,776 --> 00:43:53,576
Both of them look funny.

1206
00:43:57,343 --> 00:44:00,243
(We're idol singers, we're Wanna One)

1207
00:44:01,176 --> 00:44:02,676
He's staggering.

1208
00:44:03,810 --> 00:44:04,910
He's staggering.

1209
00:44:04,910 --> 00:44:06,643
(He's still sleepy)

1210
00:44:08,176 --> 00:44:09,210
Why don't you sleep more?

1211
00:44:10,576 --> 00:44:12,043
He looks like he's not really awake.

1212
00:44:13,310 --> 00:44:14,643
Oh, no.

1213
00:44:17,376 --> 00:44:19,410
(He brushes his teeth powerfully)

1214
00:44:21,710 --> 00:44:23,943
(He washes his face like a tough man)

1215
00:44:24,710 --> 00:44:26,510
(Lastly, he gazes in the mirror)

1216
00:44:26,876 --> 00:44:28,376
My skin is too...

1217
00:44:28,376 --> 00:44:29,143
He has nice skin.

1218
00:44:31,043 --> 00:44:32,276
Are you having a cup of coffee?

1219
00:44:32,276 --> 00:44:33,910
- It's plum tea. / - Plum tea?

1220
00:44:33,910 --> 00:44:35,976
- I drink plum tea in the morning. / - Look at his hair.

1221
00:44:35,976 --> 00:44:39,110
That's fur attached to the hoodie, right?

1222
00:44:40,543 --> 00:44:41,510
Yes.

1223
00:44:41,510 --> 00:44:42,610
Yes. Yes.

1224
00:44:42,610 --> 00:44:44,176
It's attached to the hoodie.

1225
00:44:44,743 --> 00:44:47,176
(In a furry hoodie)

1226
00:44:47,743 --> 00:44:49,476
(He drinks a cup of plum tea)

1227
00:44:50,376 --> 00:44:52,376
(Brushes his teeth with power)

1228
00:44:59,576 --> 00:45:01,076
(Where is the Pink Sausage Tour going today?)

1229
00:45:01,076 --> 00:45:02,076
It looks like it's snowing.

1230
00:45:03,876 --> 00:45:04,576
Amazing.

1231
00:45:04,810 --> 00:45:06,543
(Flower road tour!)

1232
00:45:06,543 --> 00:45:07,543
It's really long.

1233
00:45:07,543 --> 00:45:08,943
(They enjoy flower rain)

1234
00:45:08,943 --> 00:45:10,343
Oh, yeah.

1235
00:45:10,510 --> 00:45:11,910
(They drink flower tea)

1236
00:45:12,176 --> 00:45:13,676
(He looks cute with his snaggletooth)

1237
00:45:13,776 --> 00:45:15,710
(They drive on a flowery road)

1238
00:45:16,243 --> 00:45:17,743
(They eat oysters)

1239
00:45:17,743 --> 00:45:18,676
It's as big as his face.

1240
00:45:19,310 --> 00:45:21,076
(They ride a canoe)

1241
00:45:21,076 --> 00:45:22,610
(Enjoying the thrills)

1242
00:45:24,143 --> 00:45:25,143
This is amazing.

1243
00:45:26,143 --> 00:45:28,843
(Flower road tour, start)

1244
00:45:31,343 --> 00:45:33,543
- That's around 4 to 5km, right? / - So pretty.

1245
00:45:35,643 --> 00:45:37,076
- It's really pretty. / - Really...

1246
00:45:37,076 --> 00:45:37,710
I know.

1247
00:45:37,710 --> 00:45:39,110
This is...

1248
00:45:39,110 --> 00:45:40,876
The 4km cherry blossom road.

1249
00:45:41,676 --> 00:45:42,676
- 4km? / - Yes.

1250
00:45:42,676 --> 00:45:45,610
It's the Ssanggyesa 4km cherry blossom road.

1251
00:45:45,610 --> 00:45:49,176
Cherry blossoms line the road for 5km.

1252
00:45:49,643 --> 00:45:52,376
There are about 1,200 cherry trees here.

1253
00:45:52,376 --> 00:45:54,643
It's so beautiful.

1254
00:45:54,643 --> 00:45:57,043
If a boy and girl hold hands

1255
00:45:57,043 --> 00:45:58,743
and walk this road...

1256
00:45:58,743 --> 00:46:02,243
They can grow old together and live happily.

1257
00:46:02,243 --> 00:46:04,576
Wow, is that all connected?

1258
00:46:05,710 --> 00:46:07,743
I get why it's called a cherry blossom road.

1259
00:46:10,543 --> 00:46:11,443
Amazing.

1260
00:46:11,876 --> 00:46:13,010
The trees are huge.

1261
00:46:13,010 --> 00:46:14,543
I get why people say it's different here.

1262
00:46:14,543 --> 00:46:16,710
They're around 40 to 50 years old.

1263
00:46:19,543 --> 00:46:21,976
- Look at the flowers falling. / - It's like CG.

1264
00:46:23,910 --> 00:46:24,843
It's so beautiful.

1265
00:46:26,710 --> 00:46:27,710
- Cherry blossoms. / - Goodness.

1266
00:46:27,710 --> 00:46:29,043
It looks gorgeous.

1267
00:46:29,043 --> 00:46:30,076
It's beautiful.

1268
00:46:30,910 --> 00:46:32,310
It does take some time to get here

1269
00:46:32,310 --> 00:46:33,710
from Hwagae Market.

1270
00:46:34,310 --> 00:46:35,876
But you must visit here.

1271
00:46:35,876 --> 00:46:37,876
Look at the flowers on the wooden deck.

1272
00:46:37,876 --> 00:46:40,110
The cherry blossoms are falling.

1273
00:46:40,110 --> 00:46:42,176
Here you can see cherry blossoms are raining.

1274
00:46:43,010 --> 00:46:44,410
I highly recommend this place.

1275
00:46:44,410 --> 00:46:45,543
This is amazing.

1276
00:46:45,543 --> 00:46:46,743
If you put out your hand,

1277
00:46:46,743 --> 00:46:47,743
cherry blossoms fall on your hand.

1278
00:46:48,776 --> 00:46:49,610
That's not CG?

1279
00:46:49,610 --> 00:46:50,710
They're floating upwards.

1280
00:46:50,710 --> 00:46:51,510
It's really like that.

1281
00:46:51,510 --> 00:46:53,010
It's like a movie.

1282
00:46:54,043 --> 00:46:54,810
It's so beautiful.

1283
00:46:55,476 --> 00:46:56,610
Look at them flying in the wind.

1284
00:46:59,376 --> 00:47:00,976
It looks like it's snowing.

1285
00:47:01,676 --> 00:47:02,876
Wait a minute.

1286
00:47:02,876 --> 00:47:05,276
- It looks like an animation. / - My goodness.

1287
00:47:06,143 --> 00:47:08,243
You couldn't make that happen on purpose.

1288
00:47:08,243 --> 00:47:09,043
It's so pretty.

1289
00:47:09,043 --> 00:47:10,343
They're flying at you.

1290
00:47:10,343 --> 00:47:11,576
It really isn't CG.

1291
00:47:14,610 --> 00:47:15,410
Catch it.

1292
00:47:19,243 --> 00:47:21,210
He's trying to catch a blossom.

1293
00:47:21,210 --> 00:47:22,743
It's so beautiful.

1294
00:47:26,176 --> 00:47:27,276
Oh, my.

1295
00:47:27,276 --> 00:47:29,343
I must go there next year.

1296
00:47:30,143 --> 00:47:33,210
- Just watching it makes me happy. / - It's so pretty.

1297
00:47:33,210 --> 00:47:33,943
It's on a different scale.

1298
00:47:33,943 --> 00:47:35,076
- I'm hungry. / - Different scale.

1299
00:47:35,076 --> 00:47:36,443
I found a corn dog vendor.

1300
00:47:36,443 --> 00:47:37,810
I love corn dogs.

1301
00:47:37,810 --> 00:47:40,976
We have to play a game to eat corn dogs.

1302
00:47:40,976 --> 00:47:42,543
- Right. Everything is about games. / - How about...

1303
00:47:42,543 --> 00:47:43,643
A "flower" song contest.

1304
00:47:43,643 --> 00:47:44,710
Okay, sounds good.

1305
00:47:44,710 --> 00:47:45,676
One verse each.

1306
00:47:45,676 --> 00:47:46,643
Okay.

1307
00:47:46,643 --> 00:47:48,176
- I'll start. / - Go.

1308
00:47:48,176 --> 00:47:50,976
??Not spring, love or cherry blossoms ??

1309
00:47:51,676 --> 00:47:53,276
Please don't come too close.

1310
00:47:53,276 --> 00:47:56,143
??Not spring, love or cherry blossoms ??

1311
00:47:56,776 --> 00:47:58,110
Please don't come too close.

1312
00:47:59,443 --> 00:48:00,410
That's too much pressure.

1313
00:48:00,410 --> 00:48:02,076
I'm trying to sing.

1314
00:48:02,076 --> 00:48:03,110
Why come in so close?

1315
00:48:03,110 --> 00:48:04,410
You scared me.

1316
00:48:04,410 --> 00:48:06,543
He zoomed in to here.

1317
00:48:06,543 --> 00:48:08,843
Normally, wouldn't you dance?

1318
00:48:08,843 --> 00:48:10,310
He scared me.

1319
00:48:11,710 --> 00:48:13,010
- Right. / - Your turn next.

1320
00:48:14,076 --> 00:48:17,776
??The day cherry blossoms fell ??

1321
00:48:18,976 --> 00:48:21,843
??That's when I first met you ??

1322
00:48:21,843 --> 00:48:23,943
??You are my flower ??

1323
00:48:27,776 --> 00:48:28,510
Your turn.

1324
00:48:28,510 --> 00:48:29,176
No more, right?

1325
00:48:29,176 --> 00:48:29,776
It's hard, right?

1326
00:48:31,243 --> 00:48:32,476
10,

1327
00:48:32,476 --> 00:48:33,210
9...

1328
00:48:33,210 --> 00:48:35,910
- Jihoon is... / - ??Buy some flowers ??

1329
00:48:35,910 --> 00:48:37,943
??Buy some flowers ??

1330
00:48:37,943 --> 00:48:40,576
??Oh, yeah ??

1331
00:48:40,576 --> 00:48:41,343
Don't you know this song?

1332
00:48:41,343 --> 00:48:43,443
Name the title and the artist.

1333
00:48:43,443 --> 00:48:44,510
- Really? / - Yes.

1334
00:48:44,510 --> 00:48:47,076
It's buy some flowers.

1335
00:48:47,076 --> 00:48:49,743
(First time they've heard this)

1336
00:48:50,376 --> 00:48:52,043
It's your turn now.

1337
00:48:52,843 --> 00:48:54,810
It's really hard to think of songs with "flower."

1338
00:48:54,810 --> 00:48:56,143
I thought of one.

1339
00:48:56,143 --> 00:48:59,176
??Come to me when the cosmos blooms ??

1340
00:48:59,176 --> 00:49:01,776
??Oh, yeah ??

1341
00:49:01,776 --> 00:49:03,576
Is he making up this song?

1342
00:49:03,576 --> 00:49:05,510
What kind of nonsense song is this?

1343
00:49:05,510 --> 00:49:06,810
What are you on about?

1344
00:49:06,810 --> 00:49:09,876
I've never heard of that song.

1345
00:49:09,876 --> 00:49:11,943
I understand if you don't know the song.

1346
00:49:11,943 --> 00:49:13,643
I don't know such a song.

1347
00:49:13,643 --> 00:49:15,343
You really don't know this song?

1348
00:49:15,343 --> 00:49:16,543
Who is the artist?

1349
00:49:17,410 --> 00:49:18,343
Park Woojin.

1350
00:49:18,343 --> 00:49:19,043
Park Woojin.

1351
00:49:19,043 --> 00:49:21,043
(It's my song)

1352
00:49:21,543 --> 00:49:22,776
The artist is Park Woojin?

1353
00:49:22,776 --> 00:49:24,943
The person buying corn dogs is Park Woojin too.

1354
00:49:24,943 --> 00:49:26,310
I couldn't think of any.

1355
00:49:27,943 --> 00:49:28,976
Hello.

1356
00:49:28,976 --> 00:49:30,876
- Hello. / - Hello.

1357
00:49:30,876 --> 00:49:31,810
Just two please.

1358
00:49:31,810 --> 00:49:33,910
Two corn dogs

1359
00:49:33,910 --> 00:49:36,676
and two peach ice teas please.

1360
00:49:36,676 --> 00:49:38,410
- Two peach ice teas? / - Yes.

1361
00:49:38,410 --> 00:49:40,343
- You look familiar. / - Pardon?

1362
00:49:40,343 --> 00:49:41,810
Aren't you on TV?

1363
00:49:41,810 --> 00:49:43,443
- Yes, we're on TV a little. / - Yes.

1364
00:49:43,443 --> 00:49:44,343
Goodness.

1365
00:49:44,343 --> 00:49:45,576
Do you know Wanna One?

1366
00:49:45,576 --> 00:49:46,843
- What? / - Do you know Wanna One?

1367
00:49:48,243 --> 00:49:49,010
Wanna One.

1368
00:49:49,010 --> 00:49:50,076
- Wanna One? / - Yes.

1369
00:49:50,076 --> 00:49:51,476
What's that?

1370
00:49:52,676 --> 00:49:53,643
Wanna One.

1371
00:49:55,343 --> 00:49:56,976
What is this?

1372
00:49:57,710 --> 00:49:58,243
It's sugar.

1373
00:49:58,243 --> 00:49:59,743
You dip the corn dogs in sugar.

1374
00:50:00,376 --> 00:50:01,876
(This is the best way to eat corn dogs)

1375
00:50:01,876 --> 00:50:02,843
That's delicious.

1376
00:50:02,843 --> 00:50:04,143
That's the trend these days.

1377
00:50:04,143 --> 00:50:05,843
- Thank you. / - It's salty and sweet.

1378
00:50:05,843 --> 00:50:07,743
It's self-serve

1379
00:50:07,743 --> 00:50:10,243
but I'll do it for you, since you're Wanna One.

1380
00:50:10,243 --> 00:50:12,210
Thank you.

1381
00:50:12,876 --> 00:50:14,176
- Thank you. / - Good-bye.

1382
00:50:14,176 --> 00:50:15,743
- Bye. / - Bye.

1383
00:50:15,743 --> 00:50:17,043
- Wow, corn dog. / - It's been so long...

1384
00:50:17,043 --> 00:50:18,810
Since I ate a corn dog.

1385
00:50:18,810 --> 00:50:20,110
- It's good. / - That looks so good.

1386
00:50:20,110 --> 00:50:22,343
- We had a snack. / - Yeah.

1387
00:50:22,343 --> 00:50:23,610
Now let's go for real food.

1388
00:50:25,043 --> 00:50:27,010
Since we ate while standing, let's sit down and eat.

1389
00:50:27,010 --> 00:50:28,176
We should eat while lying down.

1390
00:50:28,176 --> 00:50:29,210
Okay, let's go.

1391
00:50:31,043 --> 00:50:32,043
(Chomp)

1392
00:50:33,076 --> 00:50:35,776
(Pink Sausage Tour)

1393
00:50:35,776 --> 00:50:36,410
(Cross)

1394
00:50:42,910 --> 00:50:44,043
I don't know dance well.

1395
00:50:44,043 --> 00:50:45,410
What kind of dance is that?

1396
00:50:46,210 --> 00:50:47,243
That's random dancing.

1397
00:50:48,643 --> 00:50:49,443
That's nice.

1398
00:50:52,876 --> 00:50:57,076
Let's rest and drink some tea.

1399
00:50:57,076 --> 00:50:57,910
Tea...

1400
00:50:59,776 --> 00:51:00,743
It's high-quality green tea.

1401
00:51:01,776 --> 00:51:03,310
It's so nice.

1402
00:51:05,943 --> 00:51:09,443
(They even have delicious tea that has pretty colors)

1403
00:51:10,110 --> 00:51:11,710
- That's so pretty. / - That's amazing.

1404
00:51:11,710 --> 00:51:12,443
This place is nice.

1405
00:51:12,443 --> 00:51:15,976
What do people usually drink when they're here?

1406
00:51:15,976 --> 00:51:17,476
This is the town of green tea,

1407
00:51:17,476 --> 00:51:18,610
so people drink a lot of green tea.

1408
00:51:18,610 --> 00:51:19,710
- Green tea? / - Yes.

1409
00:51:19,710 --> 00:51:21,310
The ujeon leaf is the best one.

1410
00:51:21,310 --> 00:51:23,076
- Ujeon? / - It's the highest quality leaf.

1411
00:51:24,110 --> 00:51:25,443
I'll try the ujeon tea.

1412
00:51:25,443 --> 00:51:27,910
- We should also try the ice cream. / - Yes.

1413
00:51:27,910 --> 00:51:29,343
- I want green tea ice cream. / - That sounds good.

1414
00:51:29,343 --> 00:51:32,476
- About you? / - I drink more green tea than water.

1415
00:51:32,476 --> 00:51:34,143
We'll have green tea...

1416
00:51:34,143 --> 00:51:35,676
And red balloon flower?

1417
00:51:35,676 --> 00:51:38,843
Red balloon flower ice cream sounds fancy.

1418
00:51:38,843 --> 00:51:40,210
There are so many tea cups.

1419
00:51:42,143 --> 00:51:43,176
I was so shocked.

1420
00:51:43,176 --> 00:51:44,310
Why?

1421
00:51:44,310 --> 00:51:45,010
Why?

1422
00:51:50,843 --> 00:51:52,610
You'd feel like drinking tea there.

1423
00:51:52,610 --> 00:51:53,810
I was really surprised.

1424
00:51:54,576 --> 00:51:56,110
It's a terrace.

1425
00:51:56,110 --> 00:51:58,410
Like green tea field.

1426
00:51:58,410 --> 00:52:00,176
They made it like a green tea terrace?

1427
00:52:00,176 --> 00:52:01,510
Since green tea is the most famous here.

1428
00:52:01,510 --> 00:52:04,243
It's like a terrace...

1429
00:52:04,243 --> 00:52:05,576
What a great idea.

1430
00:52:05,576 --> 00:52:09,176
(Tea ceremony time with Jihoon)

1431
00:52:11,076 --> 00:52:12,143
This is called a "chaho."

1432
00:52:12,143 --> 00:52:14,576
- It's where the tea is stored. / - I see.

1433
00:52:14,576 --> 00:52:18,743
- Now you add some water to the "suku." / - I see.

1434
00:52:18,743 --> 00:52:21,110
Then you warm the cup.

1435
00:52:21,943 --> 00:52:23,810
That's the way.

1436
00:52:23,810 --> 00:52:25,210
Next.

1437
00:52:25,210 --> 00:52:26,443
That's the way.

1438
00:52:26,443 --> 00:52:27,876
- That's not easy. / - Next.

1439
00:52:27,876 --> 00:52:29,443
Pour water in here again.

1440
00:52:29,443 --> 00:52:32,476
Then you drink the tea in this.

1441
00:52:33,143 --> 00:52:35,276
Don't soak the tea for too long.

1442
00:52:35,276 --> 00:52:37,376
Just count to 15.

1443
00:52:37,376 --> 00:52:38,543
So around 15 seconds.

1444
00:52:38,543 --> 00:52:40,576
Just count to 15,

1445
00:52:40,576 --> 00:52:41,710
then pour it.

1446
00:52:41,710 --> 00:52:43,643
Then you can drink it.

1447
00:52:43,643 --> 00:52:46,476
- She's teaching them so nicely. / - Pour it like this.

1448
00:52:47,543 --> 00:52:49,610
Green tea tastes better like that.

1449
00:52:49,610 --> 00:52:51,676
- So they say. / - Yes.

1450
00:52:51,676 --> 00:52:52,876
The green tea is complete.

1451
00:52:52,876 --> 00:52:53,643
Drink up.

1452
00:52:53,643 --> 00:52:54,410
It's hot.

1453
00:52:55,643 --> 00:52:57,843
You filled it to the brim so I can't pick it up.

1454
00:53:01,443 --> 00:53:02,110
It's too hot.

1455
00:53:02,110 --> 00:53:03,276
This...

1456
00:53:03,276 --> 00:53:06,310
The ice cream is losing its shape.

1457
00:53:06,310 --> 00:53:08,376
Let's try the ice cream first.

1458
00:53:08,376 --> 00:53:09,910
Let's eat the ice cream...

1459
00:53:09,910 --> 00:53:11,310
- Until the tea cools. / - Okay.

1460
00:53:11,310 --> 00:53:12,743
- The red balloon flower. / - This is green tea.

1461
00:53:12,743 --> 00:53:14,310
- That looks so good. / - Try the green tea.

1462
00:53:15,276 --> 00:53:16,543
How good must it be?

1463
00:53:19,176 --> 00:53:22,743
It's different from ordinary green tea ice cream.

1464
00:53:22,743 --> 00:53:25,343
It tastes like we're really drinking green tea.

1465
00:53:25,343 --> 00:53:26,510
I really like it.

1466
00:53:26,510 --> 00:53:30,076
It has the sweet but bitter taste of green tea.

1467
00:53:31,076 --> 00:53:32,810
I'll try the red balloon flower.

1468
00:53:33,376 --> 00:53:35,743
I usually don't like balloon flower.

1469
00:53:35,743 --> 00:53:38,910
It has that strong bitter taste.

1470
00:53:38,910 --> 00:53:41,143
- It tastes healthy. / - Let's see...

1471
00:53:41,143 --> 00:53:41,810
If we're the same.

1472
00:53:43,043 --> 00:53:44,143
I really want to try that.

1473
00:53:44,143 --> 00:53:45,543
- The balloon flower? / - Yes.

1474
00:53:45,543 --> 00:53:47,243
We had a bias toward it at first.

1475
00:53:47,243 --> 00:53:48,510
Because it's balloon flower.

1476
00:53:48,510 --> 00:53:51,410
- I don't really like bitter foods. / - Try another bite.

1477
00:53:51,410 --> 00:53:54,543
I tried it out of curiosity.

1478
00:53:57,010 --> 00:53:58,543
(He quickly takes a bite)

1479
00:53:58,543 --> 00:53:59,910
Is this balloon flower?

1480
00:54:01,676 --> 00:54:02,343
It doesn't taste like it at all.

1481
00:54:02,343 --> 00:54:03,943
It's a flavor I never imagined.

1482
00:54:04,643 --> 00:54:07,410
It kind of tastes like coffee as well.

1483
00:54:07,410 --> 00:54:09,843
They made balloon flower taste really nice.

1484
00:54:09,843 --> 00:54:11,510
If you don't say it's balloon flower, no one would know.

1485
00:54:11,510 --> 00:54:12,310
- Really? / - Yes.

1486
00:54:12,310 --> 00:54:13,410
That's interesting.

1487
00:54:14,043 --> 00:54:14,910
If there was green tea grass,

1488
00:54:14,910 --> 00:54:16,776
I would eat grass all day.

1489
00:54:17,543 --> 00:54:18,776
If it tastes like this.

1490
00:54:20,676 --> 00:54:22,443
- It must be really good. / - You've fallen for it.

1491
00:54:22,443 --> 00:54:23,910
Hey, the soup.

1492
00:54:23,910 --> 00:54:26,643
- Hey, the soup. / - Soup?

1493
00:54:26,643 --> 00:54:27,576
Soup?

1494
00:54:28,776 --> 00:54:29,776
We have to try this.

1495
00:54:29,776 --> 00:54:30,543
It's not too hot now.

1496
00:54:30,543 --> 00:54:31,210
Soup...

1497
00:54:35,076 --> 00:54:36,543
(Tasting)

1498
00:54:42,176 --> 00:54:44,210
(Scratching)

1499
00:54:45,310 --> 00:54:47,810
Why do I taste green tea ice cream?

1500
00:54:47,810 --> 00:54:48,810
Me too.

1501
00:54:48,810 --> 00:54:50,143
They ate something too strong first.

1502
00:54:50,143 --> 00:54:51,243
It tastes like rinsing your mouth with water

1503
00:54:51,243 --> 00:54:52,143
after eating ice cream.

1504
00:54:53,243 --> 00:54:56,143
The ice cream is too strong.

1505
00:54:56,143 --> 00:54:57,643
It's too sweet.

1506
00:54:57,643 --> 00:54:59,743
- If you eat the overpowering one first... / - Right.

1507
00:54:59,743 --> 00:55:01,276
You won't taste anything.

1508
00:55:01,276 --> 00:55:03,710
We drank some tea and the weather is nice.

1509
00:55:03,710 --> 00:55:05,343
I'll write a poem.

1510
00:55:05,343 --> 00:55:06,276
Sounds good.

1511
00:55:06,276 --> 00:55:07,510
The thing I remember...

1512
00:55:07,510 --> 00:55:09,710
I'll recite a poem with red balloon flower.

1513
00:55:09,710 --> 00:55:10,743
Alright.

1514
00:55:10,743 --> 00:55:12,976
I'll do Hadong green tea.

1515
00:55:12,976 --> 00:55:14,476
You're going to break it.

1516
00:55:14,476 --> 00:55:16,110
Let's write it reverently.

1517
00:55:17,543 --> 00:55:21,310
(He writes with one stroke of a brush)

1518
00:55:21,643 --> 00:55:22,976
The green tea is so good.

1519
00:55:26,210 --> 00:55:28,410
(He poured to the brim again)

1520
00:55:29,443 --> 00:55:30,843
(Sighing)

1521
00:55:31,276 --> 00:55:32,576
It's hard.

1522
00:55:32,576 --> 00:55:34,543
Can I change my topic?

1523
00:55:34,543 --> 00:55:36,110
Is this also a competition?

1524
00:55:36,110 --> 00:55:36,810
Yes.

1525
00:55:36,810 --> 00:55:38,076
- It's a competition? / - It's a competition.

1526
00:55:40,210 --> 00:55:41,810
(That's his 10th cup of tea)

1527
00:55:43,276 --> 00:55:45,643
(He's had green tea)

1528
00:55:47,710 --> 00:55:49,710
- He's got a food coma. / - Food coma.

1529
00:55:49,710 --> 00:55:50,510
I'm done.

1530
00:55:51,410 --> 00:55:52,210
I'm finally done.

1531
00:55:52,210 --> 00:55:53,210
Okay, read it out loud.

1532
00:55:53,776 --> 00:55:55,076
You'll regret if I read first.

1533
00:55:56,776 --> 00:55:57,910
(Did he use his brain too hard?)

1534
00:55:58,676 --> 00:56:00,210
This is a wonderful poem.

1535
00:56:00,710 --> 00:56:03,610
I'll read mine.

1536
00:56:03,610 --> 00:56:04,710
Ha.

1537
00:56:04,710 --> 00:56:06,610
There's no other way.

1538
00:56:06,610 --> 00:56:07,910
Dong.

1539
00:56:07,910 --> 00:56:09,743
I can only stomp my feet.

1540
00:56:09,743 --> 00:56:10,876
Green.

1541
00:56:10,876 --> 00:56:11,810
When I knock...

1542
00:56:13,943 --> 00:56:14,710
Tea.

1543
00:56:14,710 --> 00:56:15,243
Tea.

1544
00:56:16,776 --> 00:56:17,976
I'll kick you.

1545
00:56:20,443 --> 00:56:21,743
You failed.

1546
00:56:21,743 --> 00:56:22,343
What is that?

1547
00:56:23,643 --> 00:56:24,810
It's not about red balloon flower.

1548
00:56:26,076 --> 00:56:27,376
I wrote an 8-line poem.

1549
00:56:28,710 --> 00:56:29,576
That's difficult.

1550
00:56:29,576 --> 00:56:31,743
I did Scenic Road of Korea.

1551
00:56:33,010 --> 00:56:34,643
Scen.

1552
00:56:34,643 --> 00:56:35,910
There is a group.

1553
00:56:36,810 --> 00:56:38,376
(It's a good start)

1554
00:56:38,376 --> 00:56:39,443
Ic.

1555
00:56:39,443 --> 00:56:40,943
They were picked by the nation.

1556
00:56:43,076 --> 00:56:44,076
Ro.

1557
00:56:44,076 --> 00:56:45,443
They're like brothers.

1558
00:56:46,143 --> 00:56:47,210
Ad.

1559
00:56:47,210 --> 00:56:48,610
They have a lot of charm.

1560
00:56:49,276 --> 00:56:50,176
Of.

1561
00:56:50,176 --> 00:56:51,510
They're manly.

1562
00:56:52,443 --> 00:56:53,510
Ko.

1563
00:56:53,510 --> 00:56:54,843
They're good at a lot of things.

1564
00:56:55,710 --> 00:56:56,543
Re.

1565
00:56:56,543 --> 00:56:58,210
They gathered as one like destiny.

1566
00:56:58,210 --> 00:57:00,143
Now they...

1567
00:57:00,143 --> 00:57:01,276
A.

1568
00:57:01,276 --> 00:57:03,543
Want to reach the top.

1569
00:57:04,876 --> 00:57:05,776
(First place)

1570
00:57:06,443 --> 00:57:07,710
First place.

1571
00:57:09,643 --> 00:57:10,910
You win.

1572
00:57:10,910 --> 00:57:11,643
Complete success.

1573
00:57:11,643 --> 00:57:14,043
(Jihoon, buy 100 cups)

1574
00:57:14,043 --> 00:57:16,143
Didn't you enjoy the cherry blossoms

1575
00:57:16,143 --> 00:57:17,576
with your eyes?

1576
00:57:17,576 --> 00:57:18,510
Yes.

1577
00:57:18,510 --> 00:57:21,343
How about enjoying the cherry blossoms

1578
00:57:21,343 --> 00:57:22,943
with your mouth?

1579
00:57:22,943 --> 00:57:23,876
Yes.

1580
00:57:23,876 --> 00:57:25,176
That sounds excellent.

1581
00:57:25,176 --> 00:57:26,810
Let's put a flag here.

1582
00:57:26,810 --> 00:57:27,776
Here?

1583
00:57:29,810 --> 00:57:30,810
I thought it was a commercial.

1584
00:57:42,543 --> 00:57:43,910
(Lamellated oyster)

1585
00:57:43,910 --> 00:57:45,576
- It's finally here. / - Time for the oysters.

1586
00:57:45,576 --> 00:57:46,743
We finally get to see it.

1587
00:57:47,076 --> 00:57:49,643
(Plus enjoying the cherry blossoms while driving)

1588
00:57:50,376 --> 00:57:51,543
From Seoul,

1589
00:57:51,543 --> 00:57:53,043
they don't just drop by.

1590
00:57:53,043 --> 00:57:55,510
They come just to eat the oysters.

1591
00:57:55,510 --> 00:57:58,276
He's the driver from yesterday.

1592
00:57:58,276 --> 00:58:00,443
They did a taxi tour on the second day too.

1593
00:58:01,510 --> 00:58:03,876
The biggest oyster I've seen

1594
00:58:03,876 --> 00:58:05,710
was the size of two hands.

1595
00:58:05,710 --> 00:58:06,576
- An oyster? / - Yes.

1596
00:58:07,343 --> 00:58:08,543
It's bigger than these chopsticks.

1597
00:58:08,543 --> 00:58:09,476
It's as big as your shoes.

1598
00:58:11,076 --> 00:58:12,643
It's as big as their faces.

1599
00:58:15,876 --> 00:58:17,143
I have to go there to eat that.

1600
00:58:18,243 --> 00:58:19,543
(They also have this refreshing dish)

1601
00:58:19,543 --> 00:58:19,943
(Marsh clam soup)

1602
00:58:19,943 --> 00:58:20,910
That looks so good.

1603
00:58:27,743 --> 00:58:30,210
- They're so big. / - They're all shells.

1604
00:58:30,210 --> 00:58:31,043
Oyster shells.

1605
00:58:31,043 --> 00:58:32,543
It has that smell.

1606
00:58:32,543 --> 00:58:33,876
That oyster smell.

1607
00:58:35,376 --> 00:58:37,843
I smelled the ocean there.

1608
00:58:37,843 --> 00:58:38,976
- You're from Busan. / - Yes.

1609
00:58:40,576 --> 00:58:42,876
We never tried lamellated oyster, right?

1610
00:58:42,876 --> 00:58:45,643
- It's a first. / - Never seen them before.

1611
00:58:45,643 --> 00:58:46,976
Excuse me.

1612
00:58:48,076 --> 00:58:49,243
Here's the fire.

1613
00:58:50,210 --> 00:58:50,776
It's coal briquettes.

1614
00:58:51,743 --> 00:58:53,410
It's not coal briquettes, it's charcoal.

1615
00:58:54,210 --> 00:58:54,810
It's charcoal.

1616
00:58:56,010 --> 00:58:57,176
They're so big.

1617
00:58:57,176 --> 00:58:59,410
(Thanks to the generous owner)

1618
00:59:00,443 --> 00:59:01,543
That's so nice.

1619
00:59:02,110 --> 00:59:03,576
- Thank you. / - So big.

1620
00:59:04,243 --> 00:59:06,343
What is this?

1621
00:59:06,343 --> 00:59:08,043
Isn't this a shoe?

1622
00:59:09,476 --> 00:59:10,710
Isn't this a rubber shoe?

1623
00:59:11,376 --> 00:59:13,510
Isn't it too big?

1624
00:59:13,510 --> 00:59:15,810
It's bigger than these chopsticks.

1625
00:59:15,810 --> 00:59:17,143
It's really big.

1626
00:59:17,143 --> 00:59:19,743
It's about 5 to 10 times bigger

1627
00:59:19,743 --> 00:59:20,576
than ordinary oysters.

1628
00:59:20,576 --> 00:59:22,743
It can grow up to 40cm.

1629
00:59:23,576 --> 00:59:24,743
- 40cm? / - Yes.

1630
00:59:24,743 --> 00:59:26,176
How long do we have to grill them?

1631
00:59:26,176 --> 00:59:28,076
About 10 minutes.

1632
00:59:28,076 --> 00:59:29,043
10 minutes.

1633
00:59:29,043 --> 00:59:30,676
They're called "cherry blossom oysters" in Korea.

1634
00:59:30,676 --> 00:59:32,210
The reason being...

1635
00:59:32,210 --> 00:59:34,210
They live on the rocks under water.

1636
00:59:34,210 --> 00:59:35,910
Stuck on the rock, they open the shells

1637
00:59:35,910 --> 00:59:37,176
to catch their food.

1638
00:59:37,176 --> 00:59:39,410
Then you can see the white muscle.

1639
00:59:39,410 --> 00:59:41,243
So thousands of oysters are on the rock

1640
00:59:41,243 --> 00:59:42,243
with their shells open,

1641
00:59:42,243 --> 00:59:43,776
and it looks like cherry blossoms in bloom.

1642
00:59:43,776 --> 00:59:44,710
That's why they're called that.

1643
00:59:45,810 --> 00:59:46,843
(Some says it's because they taste the best)

1644
00:59:46,843 --> 00:59:47,610
(During cherry blossom season)

1645
00:59:47,976 --> 00:59:50,243
(He opens the shell)

1646
00:59:50,243 --> 00:59:51,543
It's really big.

1647
00:59:52,876 --> 00:59:54,643
Wow, that's so...

1648
00:59:54,643 --> 00:59:55,310
They're huge.

1649
00:59:55,310 --> 00:59:57,110
You'd get full off one.

1650
00:59:58,743 --> 00:59:59,876
That's incredible.

1651
01:00:00,576 --> 01:00:02,543
Now you can use this as a plate.

1652
01:00:04,543 --> 01:00:05,876
That one's all cooked.

1653
01:00:05,876 --> 01:00:06,843
It's bigger than my finger.

1654
01:00:10,043 --> 01:00:11,076
This is amazing.

1655
01:00:11,076 --> 01:00:11,743
With the kimchi.

1656
01:00:11,743 --> 01:00:13,310
Eat it with kimchi.

1657
01:00:13,776 --> 01:00:15,010
That looks so good.

1658
01:00:15,010 --> 01:00:16,410
- This is unfair. / - It looks delicious.

1659
01:00:18,576 --> 01:00:19,843
I'm so excited.

1660
01:00:20,443 --> 01:00:21,576
Try it.

1661
01:00:21,576 --> 01:00:22,343
Here we go.

1662
01:00:24,343 --> 01:00:25,310
How is it?

1663
01:00:28,410 --> 01:00:29,043
It's amazing.

1664
01:00:29,043 --> 01:00:31,876
Oysters are usually too small.

1665
01:00:31,876 --> 01:00:33,143
But this oyster is like...

1666
01:00:33,143 --> 01:00:34,343
Oyster in your face.

1667
01:00:35,843 --> 01:00:37,110
It doesn't have a fishy smell at all.

1668
01:00:38,143 --> 01:00:39,710
It goes perfectly with kimchi.

1669
01:00:40,676 --> 01:00:42,576
If you like oysters,

1670
01:00:42,576 --> 01:00:44,476
you should visit here.

1671
01:00:45,176 --> 01:00:46,610
It's really delicious.

1672
01:00:48,910 --> 01:00:51,310
I'm fascinated that they live in the river.

1673
01:00:51,310 --> 01:00:52,510
Actually, I was a bit worried

1674
01:00:52,510 --> 01:00:54,010
because I can't handle fishy food.

1675
01:00:54,610 --> 01:00:55,643
This doesn't

1676
01:00:55,643 --> 01:00:57,243
have a fishy smell,

1677
01:00:57,243 --> 01:00:59,810
yet it tastes richer and more

1678
01:00:59,810 --> 01:01:01,676
nutritious than normal oysters.

1679
01:01:01,676 --> 01:01:03,043
It has more nutrition in it.

1680
01:01:04,343 --> 01:01:06,376
Its texture is more delicate, right?

1681
01:01:06,376 --> 01:01:07,910
It's less chewy than...

1682
01:01:07,910 --> 01:01:10,343
- It's less chewy? / - Compared to regular oysters.

1683
01:01:10,343 --> 01:01:12,543
You could say it's softer.

1684
01:01:12,543 --> 01:01:14,743
But it has a much richer smell.

1685
01:01:16,043 --> 01:01:17,176
It must be really delicious.

1686
01:01:18,476 --> 01:01:21,076
It feels like "This is it," right?

1687
01:01:21,076 --> 01:01:22,776
You can't go wrong with chili pepper sauce with vinegar.

1688
01:01:22,776 --> 01:01:24,276
Yoojung, you're too into it.

1689
01:01:26,276 --> 01:01:27,310
- It looks so delicious. / - Marsh clams.

1690
01:01:27,743 --> 01:01:29,643
See the round things?

1691
01:01:29,643 --> 01:01:30,510
That's marsh clam.

1692
01:01:31,676 --> 01:01:33,443
This is marsh clam?

1693
01:01:33,443 --> 01:01:34,076
Yes, marsh clam.

1694
01:01:34,076 --> 01:01:35,543
I'm not sure why...

1695
01:01:35,543 --> 01:01:36,776
But marsh clam is not so tasty in other regions.

1696
01:01:36,776 --> 01:01:37,376
True.

1697
01:01:38,043 --> 01:01:39,276
There are a lot of marsh clam restaurants in Seoul.

1698
01:01:39,276 --> 01:01:40,210
They do.

1699
01:01:41,010 --> 01:01:43,243
But you have to go there...

1700
01:01:43,243 --> 01:01:45,643
- It tastes richer there. / - You can only taste it there.

1701
01:01:45,643 --> 01:01:46,276
It's exactly the same.

1702
01:01:46,976 --> 01:01:49,043
It's the same as the soup I had as a kid.

1703
01:01:49,043 --> 01:01:51,210
Having marsh clam soup and rice in the morning

1704
01:01:51,210 --> 01:01:52,510
is the best.

1705
01:01:52,510 --> 01:01:53,710
You put rice in the soup?

1706
01:01:53,710 --> 01:01:54,543
Yes, put the rice in the soup.

1707
01:01:54,543 --> 01:01:55,476
I always ate it like that.

1708
01:01:56,110 --> 01:01:58,743
(The sound is appetizing)

1709
01:01:59,676 --> 01:02:00,610
You eat it while cooking it.

1710
01:02:01,410 --> 01:02:02,510
It looks amazing.

1711
01:02:03,610 --> 01:02:05,510
I can't believe this. It's exactly like how I remember.

1712
01:02:06,043 --> 01:02:07,143
It tastes exactly the same as

1713
01:02:07,143 --> 01:02:08,510
the one I had when I was young.

1714
01:02:08,510 --> 01:02:10,910
With this, clearing a bowl is not a problem.

1715
01:02:10,910 --> 01:02:13,576
Marsh clam used to be common in the past

1716
01:02:13,576 --> 01:02:16,076
but it's quite rare these days.

1717
01:02:16,076 --> 01:02:18,176
It's incredibly delicious.

1718
01:02:18,176 --> 01:02:19,543
It looks so delicious.

1719
01:02:19,543 --> 01:02:21,176
(Staring)

1720
01:02:21,643 --> 01:02:24,143
Are you here to eat oysters or to sweat?

1721
01:02:24,143 --> 01:02:26,176
You must have really enjoyed the food.

1722
01:02:26,176 --> 01:02:27,343
It's been a while since I had such good food.

1723
01:02:29,110 --> 01:02:30,043
The taxi driver mentioned...

1724
01:02:31,110 --> 01:02:33,310
That people from Seoul come here just for this.

1725
01:02:33,310 --> 01:02:35,543
If I knew it'd be like this, I would have come as well.

1726
01:02:35,543 --> 01:02:38,210
- The oysters... / - I totally recommend the oysters.

1727
01:02:38,210 --> 01:02:39,676
They're a seasonal food, right?

1728
01:02:39,676 --> 01:02:41,943
Yes, they're in season in spring.

1729
01:02:41,943 --> 01:02:44,443
They're in season when the cherry blossoms bloom.

1730
01:02:44,443 --> 01:02:45,243
That's right..

1731
01:02:46,210 --> 01:02:46,843
Then,

1732
01:02:46,843 --> 01:02:48,843
now that we've eaten and replenished our energy...

1733
01:02:48,843 --> 01:02:50,076
Let's see who is stronger.

1734
01:02:50,076 --> 01:02:51,676
Let's do a proper match.

1735
01:02:52,776 --> 01:02:53,810
To see who's stronger?

1736
01:02:53,810 --> 01:02:54,643
Sounds good.

1737
01:02:57,143 --> 01:02:58,543
I didn't expect I would

1738
01:02:58,543 --> 01:03:00,576
have to showcase my strength here.

1739
01:03:00,576 --> 01:03:01,310
Strength battle.

1740
01:03:03,776 --> 01:03:05,243
(If that's what you want)

1741
01:03:05,376 --> 01:03:06,343
Thumb wrestling.

1742
01:03:07,176 --> 01:03:08,376
Hang on. I'm really bad at this.

1743
01:03:08,376 --> 01:03:09,576
What are you doing?

1744
01:03:09,576 --> 01:03:10,443
Hang on. I'm really bad at this.

1745
01:03:10,443 --> 01:03:11,643
What are you doing?

1746
01:03:12,343 --> 01:03:14,143
Hang on a second.

1747
01:03:16,476 --> 01:03:19,643
Woojin can bend his thumb all the way

1748
01:03:19,643 --> 01:03:20,676
to the back.

1749
01:03:20,676 --> 01:03:21,776
Then...

1750
01:03:21,776 --> 01:03:23,110
(It looks amazing)

1751
01:03:23,276 --> 01:03:24,943
Give me power, oysters.

1752
01:03:24,943 --> 01:03:25,576
Ready.

1753
01:03:26,376 --> 01:03:27,310
Set. Go.

1754
01:03:28,676 --> 01:03:29,976
I have a bending technique.

1755
01:03:29,976 --> 01:03:31,276
Press it.

1756
01:03:31,276 --> 01:03:32,076
Press it.

1757
01:03:32,076 --> 01:03:33,210
It's like a switch.

1758
01:03:33,210 --> 01:03:35,510
- It's a switch. / - How do you do that?

1759
01:03:35,510 --> 01:03:37,576
I never lose this game.

1760
01:03:41,176 --> 01:03:41,843
What is he doing?

1761
01:03:43,110 --> 01:03:44,310
(I got you!)

1762
01:03:44,310 --> 01:03:45,410
(Why you!)

1763
01:03:46,310 --> 01:03:47,910
- This is so boring. / - How does that work?

1764
01:03:47,910 --> 01:03:48,810
Like this.

1765
01:03:48,810 --> 01:03:49,843
I can't do that.

1766
01:03:49,843 --> 01:03:50,543
That's incredible.

1767
01:03:51,610 --> 01:03:52,676
That's weird.

1768
01:03:53,443 --> 01:03:54,976
He can do it as well.

1769
01:03:54,976 --> 01:03:56,343
- I can bend mine this far back. / - Interesting.

1770
01:03:57,110 --> 01:03:58,010
- What? / - It bends a lot.

1771
01:03:58,010 --> 01:03:59,343
You can do it just like I do.

1772
01:03:59,343 --> 01:04:00,510
I can't bend it that much.

1773
01:04:01,510 --> 01:04:02,510
I've never met someone who can do this.

1774
01:04:03,310 --> 01:04:04,743
(They're searching activities in Hadong)

1775
01:04:05,176 --> 01:04:08,476
It says you can canoe along Seomjingang.

1776
01:04:08,476 --> 01:04:11,110
It looks fun. There seems to be a strong current.

1777
01:04:11,110 --> 01:04:12,343
Look at the cherry blossoms.

1778
01:04:13,010 --> 01:04:14,910
I want to do this.

1779
01:04:14,910 --> 01:04:16,776
Canoe? Me too.

1780
01:04:16,776 --> 01:04:18,043
You do the research on it.

1781
01:04:18,043 --> 01:04:19,076
Alright.

1782
01:04:20,143 --> 01:04:21,310
Hold it straight.

1783
01:04:22,576 --> 01:04:24,243
Things like that might not look fun

1784
01:04:24,243 --> 01:04:25,076
but they're actually fun.

1785
01:04:25,076 --> 01:04:26,476
You're right. It was a lot of fun.

1786
01:04:26,476 --> 01:04:28,643
Because we don't do it often.

1787
01:04:28,643 --> 01:04:31,143
Just staying on the boat would make you feel good.

1788
01:04:32,043 --> 01:04:34,443
Pull the row to your body.

1789
01:04:34,443 --> 01:04:38,143
This hand is just supporting.

1790
01:04:38,143 --> 01:04:38,776
Before you start canoeing,

1791
01:04:38,776 --> 01:04:40,843
let me teach you simple warm-up moves.

1792
01:04:41,643 --> 01:04:43,810
I've done this in Mungyeong.

1793
01:04:43,810 --> 01:04:45,510
It was so memorable.

1794
01:04:45,510 --> 01:04:46,676
(Heh)

1795
01:04:47,076 --> 01:04:48,543
I'll show you my power.

1796
01:04:49,910 --> 01:04:51,310
Turn it 360 degrees.

1797
01:04:54,610 --> 01:04:55,510
Oh, hey.

1798
01:04:55,510 --> 01:04:56,743
- 1, 2. / - It's swaying.

1799
01:04:56,743 --> 01:04:58,443
- 1, 2. / - 1, 2.

1800
01:04:58,443 --> 01:05:01,443
- 1, 2. / - 1, 2. Good, good, good.

1801
01:05:01,443 --> 01:05:03,276
- We're doing well. / - 1, 2.

1802
01:05:03,276 --> 01:05:04,610
1, 2.

1803
01:05:04,610 --> 01:05:06,076
- Hey. / - What?

1804
01:05:06,076 --> 01:05:06,810
I can't see the bottom.

1805
01:05:07,476 --> 01:05:08,410
You're scared?

1806
01:05:08,410 --> 01:05:10,243
You're the opposite.

1807
01:05:10,243 --> 01:05:11,310
- Jihoon's scared of water. / - You're scared of water.

1808
01:05:11,310 --> 01:05:12,510
I have a slight fear of water.

1809
01:05:12,510 --> 01:05:14,176
I have a slight fear of water.

1810
01:05:14,176 --> 01:05:16,276
If the water is black,

1811
01:05:16,276 --> 01:05:17,143
I get scared.

1812
01:05:17,143 --> 01:05:20,076
- It's scary because it looks too deep. / - 1, 2.

1813
01:05:20,076 --> 01:05:21,776
1, 2.

1814
01:05:21,776 --> 01:05:25,176
- Hey... / - It's not swaying that much.

1815
01:05:25,176 --> 01:05:27,110
- It's quite stable. / - It is. It's fun.

1816
01:05:27,710 --> 01:05:29,210
By the way...

1817
01:05:29,210 --> 01:05:30,510
I just learned something.

1818
01:05:31,510 --> 01:05:32,743
As you paddle...

1819
01:05:32,743 --> 01:05:35,476
If the boat is going to the right,

1820
01:05:35,476 --> 01:05:37,210
I can turn the boat like this.

1821
01:05:38,210 --> 01:05:39,276
(Wow)

1822
01:05:39,643 --> 01:05:40,943
I think that's how you control it.

1823
01:05:40,943 --> 01:05:42,943
There are a few people who learn this by themselves.

1824
01:05:42,943 --> 01:05:44,143
There are a few people who learn this by themselves.

1825
01:05:44,143 --> 01:05:46,710
- I'm impressed. / - Actually, canoe is...

1826
01:05:46,710 --> 01:05:47,576
A very fancy sport in many foreign countries.

1827
01:05:47,576 --> 01:05:49,910
(I'm a canoe genius)

1828
01:05:50,310 --> 01:05:51,676
Hurry up.

1829
01:05:51,676 --> 01:05:53,743
Although it started off slowly,

1830
01:05:53,743 --> 01:05:55,343
our teamwork seems to be

1831
01:05:55,343 --> 01:05:57,843
accelerating the canoe.

1832
01:05:57,843 --> 01:05:59,276
Pink Sausage canoe.

1833
01:05:59,276 --> 01:06:00,710
Fire!

1834
01:06:01,576 --> 01:06:03,310
Canoeing at Seomjingang is great

1835
01:06:03,310 --> 01:06:05,610
because the cherry blossoms are next to the river.

1836
01:06:06,343 --> 01:06:07,710
We're going straight.

1837
01:06:07,710 --> 01:06:09,210
- Straight. / - They're really good.

1838
01:06:09,876 --> 01:06:11,543
We can see the cherry blossoms from here.

1839
01:06:12,510 --> 01:06:14,176
- It's all pink. / - Even without the cherry blossoms...

1840
01:06:14,176 --> 01:06:16,576
It'd be so fun to go there now.

1841
01:06:16,576 --> 01:06:18,010
I feel like we're canoeing in a fairytale

1842
01:06:18,010 --> 01:06:19,476
and we're sailing in between.

1843
01:06:20,243 --> 01:06:22,443
We have a great view

1844
01:06:22,443 --> 01:06:23,743
and a great breeze.

1845
01:06:23,743 --> 01:06:25,776
We have great water and great air.

1846
01:06:25,776 --> 01:06:26,510
It's cool here too.

1847
01:06:26,510 --> 01:06:27,976
It's so beautiful.

1848
01:06:29,043 --> 01:06:30,876
The river is so blue.

1849
01:06:30,876 --> 01:06:32,310
It's so amazing.

1850
01:06:32,310 --> 01:06:34,043
It really looks incredible.

1851
01:06:34,043 --> 01:06:34,876
Floating on the river

1852
01:06:34,876 --> 01:06:36,443
gives you real inner peace.

1853
01:06:36,443 --> 01:06:37,843
- I bet it does. / - It really does.

1854
01:06:37,843 --> 01:06:39,776
I can't wait to feel...

1855
01:06:39,776 --> 01:06:40,976
The waves.

1856
01:06:40,976 --> 01:06:42,176
- The waves? / - Yes.

1857
01:06:42,710 --> 01:06:45,043
There will be rapids on the way.

1858
01:06:45,043 --> 01:06:47,176
Your boat will start swaying there.

1859
01:06:47,176 --> 01:06:49,243
Then hit the water like this.

1860
01:06:49,243 --> 01:06:50,410
It's stabilizing.

1861
01:06:50,410 --> 01:06:52,743
Then it will stabilize the balance of the boat.

1862
01:06:52,743 --> 01:06:53,976
As you go...

1863
01:06:53,976 --> 01:06:55,376
The canoe might flip.

1864
01:06:55,376 --> 01:06:56,976
It's coming. It's coming soon.

1865
01:06:56,976 --> 01:06:57,943
You just scared me.

1866
01:06:57,943 --> 01:06:59,210
Let's go!

1867
01:06:59,210 --> 01:07:01,576
We're almost there. We're almost there.

1868
01:07:01,576 --> 01:07:02,710
We're going to the enemy camp.

1869
01:07:05,810 --> 01:07:07,910
Gosh, I'm getting nervous.

1870
01:07:07,910 --> 01:07:09,343
Row harder!

1871
01:07:10,743 --> 01:07:13,043
Alright! Let's go!

1872
01:07:13,043 --> 01:07:13,876
This is the fun part.

1873
01:07:13,876 --> 01:07:15,176
It's over there.

1874
01:07:15,176 --> 01:07:17,043
Do you see the bubbles?

1875
01:07:17,043 --> 01:07:18,410
Let's go over there.

1876
01:07:18,410 --> 01:07:19,410
Hey, it looks tough.

1877
01:07:20,476 --> 01:07:22,276
It's going to be fun!

1878
01:07:22,276 --> 01:07:23,043
It'll be fun!

1879
01:07:25,143 --> 01:07:26,243
Oh, no. Hit the water.

1880
01:07:26,243 --> 01:07:27,176
Hit the water.

1881
01:07:29,810 --> 01:07:30,810
It was a little scary.

1882
01:07:30,810 --> 01:07:31,643
Right?

1883
01:07:34,043 --> 01:07:35,043
It was so much fun.

1884
01:07:35,043 --> 01:07:36,143
That's a strong current.

1885
01:07:38,743 --> 01:07:40,110
It looks fun.

1886
01:07:40,110 --> 01:07:42,076
I love the water too.

1887
01:07:42,076 --> 01:07:42,943
He keeps hitting it.

1888
01:07:44,676 --> 01:07:45,876
This is the fun part.

1889
01:07:45,876 --> 01:07:47,410
- Yes. / - This part of the course.

1890
01:07:47,410 --> 01:07:48,876
I was really happy.

1891
01:07:48,876 --> 01:07:50,510
I just...

1892
01:07:51,443 --> 01:07:54,676
Canoeing while watching the view was amazing.

1893
01:07:54,676 --> 01:07:58,076
I haven't felt this way in a long time.

1894
01:07:58,076 --> 01:08:00,076
I'd like to suggest this activity to those who are 20.

1895
01:08:00,076 --> 01:08:01,410
Seriously.

1896
01:08:01,410 --> 01:08:03,043
We're all busy studying

1897
01:08:03,043 --> 01:08:06,110
and working hard for our dreams.

1898
01:08:06,110 --> 01:08:07,243
But here,

1899
01:08:07,243 --> 01:08:09,510
you don't have to think about anything

1900
01:08:09,510 --> 01:08:12,576
but the view, the air, the wind, and the water.

1901
01:08:12,576 --> 01:08:14,243
It's very peaceful there.

1902
01:08:14,243 --> 01:08:15,343
Exactly.

1903
01:08:15,343 --> 01:08:17,776
You had a great trip.

1904
01:08:17,776 --> 01:08:19,410
Now we're getting to the highlight.

1905
01:08:20,310 --> 01:08:21,743
Korean beef is the best kind of meat.

1906
01:08:21,743 --> 01:08:22,243
Korean beef.

1907
01:08:22,243 --> 01:08:25,143
- Korean beef. / - Korean beef!

1908
01:08:26,943 --> 01:08:28,076
It's a golden pig.

1909
01:08:28,076 --> 01:08:29,476
- It's a golden cow. / - A golden pig?

1910
01:08:29,476 --> 01:08:31,043
It's not a pig. It's a cow.

1911
01:08:31,410 --> 01:08:32,643
Gosh, I'm sorry.

1912
01:08:33,376 --> 01:08:35,743
You must eat Korean beef in Hadong.

1913
01:08:35,743 --> 01:08:38,676
Because the cow feed is made of pine needles,

1914
01:08:38,676 --> 01:08:40,543
so one must try beef here.

1915
01:08:41,276 --> 01:08:43,843
Which cut is your favorite?

1916
01:08:43,843 --> 01:08:46,276
I like all cuts.

1917
01:08:46,276 --> 01:08:47,076
I see.

1918
01:08:47,076 --> 01:08:48,210
Let's take a look around.

1919
01:08:49,743 --> 01:08:51,610
I'd like to eat ribs.

1920
01:08:51,610 --> 01:08:52,876
Ribs.

1921
01:08:52,876 --> 01:08:55,176
The side dishes cost $4.50.

1922
01:08:55,176 --> 01:08:56,510
It grills well.

1923
01:08:59,010 --> 01:09:01,110
I want to travel there for the food.

1924
01:09:05,010 --> 01:09:08,143
If all 11 of us come here to eat meat,

1925
01:09:08,143 --> 01:09:09,676
the restaurants will have to be shut down.

1926
01:09:09,676 --> 01:09:12,876
We'll eat up all the meat.

1927
01:09:12,876 --> 01:09:14,043
We all like meat.

1928
01:09:14,043 --> 01:09:17,043
We shouldn't go to buffets.

1929
01:09:17,043 --> 01:09:18,176
It'll be big trouble.

1930
01:09:19,643 --> 01:09:20,843
Open wide.

1931
01:09:23,876 --> 01:09:24,710
How is it?

1932
01:09:25,510 --> 01:09:27,776
The tenderloin I gave you...

1933
01:09:28,776 --> 01:09:29,743
Is it tender?

1934
01:09:29,743 --> 01:09:30,576
It's...

1935
01:09:32,110 --> 01:09:34,410
It must be tender.

1936
01:09:36,576 --> 01:09:37,843
(This is it)

1937
01:09:38,543 --> 01:09:40,076
(I'll give him some too)

1938
01:09:41,076 --> 01:09:42,510
(You can have two)

1939
01:09:43,543 --> 01:09:44,876
It's too much.

1940
01:09:44,876 --> 01:09:45,810
Come on.

1941
01:09:45,810 --> 01:09:47,343
Come on.

1942
01:09:48,376 --> 01:09:49,410
(Yummy)

1943
01:09:49,810 --> 01:09:50,943
They went right in.

1944
01:09:51,710 --> 01:09:52,710
That looks delicious.

1945
01:09:55,376 --> 01:09:56,910
He doesn't even eat any lettuce.

1946
01:09:56,910 --> 01:09:58,310
It's just meat.

1947
01:09:58,310 --> 01:09:59,476
That's hardcore.

1948
01:09:59,476 --> 01:10:01,443
I wanted to taste the true flavor of the meat.

1949
01:10:01,443 --> 01:10:03,510
He looks like a true meat eater.

1950
01:10:03,510 --> 01:10:05,543
It can't get more tender than this.

1951
01:10:05,543 --> 01:10:07,343
Tenderloin is tender and flavorful.

1952
01:10:07,343 --> 01:10:08,710
Tenderloin is tender and flavorful.

1953
01:10:10,276 --> 01:10:11,910
Sirloin and rib-eye

1954
01:10:11,910 --> 01:10:13,510
taste like they're seasoned.

1955
01:10:14,776 --> 01:10:16,176
- They're fatty. / - Sirloin looks so good.

1956
01:10:16,876 --> 01:10:18,743
It's the final course. We're eating Korean beef.

1957
01:10:19,576 --> 01:10:20,976
The most memorable thing was...

1958
01:10:21,776 --> 01:10:23,743
Cooking, which I haven't done in a long time,

1959
01:10:23,743 --> 01:10:25,843
and sleeping, playing and eating in the caravan.

1960
01:10:26,843 --> 01:10:30,110
Camping itself was the most memorable.

1961
01:10:30,110 --> 01:10:32,376
We visited too many places and

1962
01:10:32,376 --> 01:10:33,976
saw cherry blossoms.

1963
01:10:33,976 --> 01:10:36,776
- That place was so pretty. / - And we took pictures.

1964
01:10:37,510 --> 01:10:38,710
We sang cherry blossom songs too.

1965
01:10:38,710 --> 01:10:39,810
That was really memorable.

1966
01:10:41,510 --> 01:10:44,210
So many petals were falling down.

1967
01:10:45,010 --> 01:10:46,776
I remember that the too.

1968
01:10:46,776 --> 01:10:50,410
We have a really busy schedule.

1969
01:10:50,410 --> 01:10:52,643
Yet I got to do a great show

1970
01:10:52,643 --> 01:10:55,210
with you, going on our first trip

1971
01:10:55,210 --> 01:10:56,543
as 20-year-olds.

1972
01:10:56,543 --> 01:10:59,043
It was meaningful. We took on challenges.

1973
01:10:59,043 --> 01:11:00,476
I'd say

1974
01:11:00,476 --> 01:11:03,143
it was a great success.

1975
01:11:03,143 --> 01:11:04,976
- You're right. / - That's so nice.

1976
01:11:04,976 --> 01:11:06,176
We played games too.

1977
01:11:06,176 --> 01:11:07,876
Will we get to do something like this again?

1978
01:11:07,876 --> 01:11:09,343
It makes me wonder.

1979
01:11:09,843 --> 01:11:11,210
Let's toast with water.

1980
01:11:12,810 --> 01:11:13,943
And end it here.

1981
01:11:13,943 --> 01:11:15,110
Not that.

1982
01:11:15,110 --> 01:11:16,576
Let's end it with what we always do.

1983
01:11:16,576 --> 01:11:18,243
Let's do that.

1984
01:11:18,243 --> 01:11:19,976
Pink Sausage Team, cross!

1985
01:11:28,810 --> 01:11:31,543
At first, you seemed awkward.

1986
01:11:31,543 --> 01:11:34,176
But at the end, you seemed so close.

1987
01:11:34,176 --> 01:11:34,876
They like each other.

1988
01:11:34,876 --> 01:11:37,010
You look like you had a good break.

1989
01:11:37,010 --> 01:11:38,243
- You're right. / - The two of us are...

1990
01:11:38,243 --> 01:11:41,543
Both 20 years old in Wanna One.

1991
01:11:41,543 --> 01:11:43,210
We're friends,

1992
01:11:43,210 --> 01:11:46,310
so we feel comfortable with each other.

1993
01:11:46,310 --> 01:11:48,010
I love their team

1994
01:11:48,010 --> 01:11:50,610
because they ate until the end.

1995
01:11:50,610 --> 01:11:51,676
They started with cold noodles and

1996
01:11:51,676 --> 01:11:52,910
ended with Korean beef.

1997
01:11:52,910 --> 01:11:55,176
Was it your first time eating Jinju cold noodles?

1998
01:11:55,176 --> 01:11:56,210
Yes, it was the first time.

1999
01:11:56,210 --> 01:11:58,310
Tell us how your first ever Jinju cold noodles tasted.

2000
01:11:58,310 --> 01:11:59,076
Be honest.

2001
01:11:59,076 --> 01:12:00,810
First of all,

2002
01:12:00,810 --> 01:12:02,010
it doesn't need any other words.

2003
01:12:02,010 --> 01:12:04,210
You just have to go and try it.

2004
01:12:04,210 --> 01:12:07,276
Should I have cold noodles or mixed noodles?

2005
01:12:07,276 --> 01:12:10,910
I suggest you to have mixed noodles.

2006
01:12:10,910 --> 01:12:11,876
What about you, Woojin?

2007
01:12:11,876 --> 01:12:13,410
I suggest cold noodles.

2008
01:12:13,410 --> 01:12:14,976
Then I should have both.

2009
01:12:14,976 --> 01:12:16,476
Because...

2010
01:12:16,476 --> 01:12:18,410
I think she's been to Hadong.

2011
01:12:19,210 --> 01:12:21,776
What do you want to eat the most?

2012
01:12:21,776 --> 01:12:23,376
Actually,

2013
01:12:23,376 --> 01:12:26,376
I want to have the red balloon flower ice cream.

2014
01:12:26,376 --> 01:12:28,810
I really love the herbal stuff.

2015
01:12:28,810 --> 01:12:30,376
She's like a middle-aged man.

2016
01:12:30,376 --> 01:12:32,243
I really want to try it.

2017
01:12:32,243 --> 01:12:34,676
20-year-olds don't usually like herbal stuff.

2018
01:12:34,676 --> 01:12:37,943
I thought Hadong taxi was

2019
01:12:37,943 --> 01:12:38,810
really interesting.

2020
01:12:38,810 --> 01:12:41,376
If you don't have a driver's license,

2021
01:12:41,376 --> 01:12:43,676
it's not easy to move around.

2022
01:12:43,676 --> 01:12:46,210
But the taxi driver showed them around.

2023
01:12:46,210 --> 01:12:46,943
That's right.

2024
01:12:46,943 --> 01:12:52,310
The taxi drivers can actually give you a tour.

2025
01:12:52,310 --> 01:12:54,243
Famous restaurants recommended

2026
01:12:54,243 --> 01:12:57,176
by local taxi drivers are the most trustworthy.

2027
01:12:57,176 --> 01:12:58,010
You're right.

2028
01:12:58,010 --> 01:13:00,576
Not those places on the internet where tourists go.

2029
01:13:00,576 --> 01:13:01,210
Right!

2030
01:13:01,210 --> 01:13:03,143
But the places they take you are good.

2031
01:13:03,143 --> 01:13:04,210
- They're delicious. / - They're really good.

2032
01:13:04,210 --> 01:13:06,943
Problem is, I think they spent too much money.

2033
01:13:06,943 --> 01:13:08,676
Because they had Korean beef too.

2034
01:13:08,676 --> 01:13:10,743
Camping wasn't cheap.

2035
01:13:10,743 --> 01:13:12,176
- That's right. / - They spent some money.

2036
01:13:12,176 --> 01:13:13,876
Men usually eat more.

2037
01:13:13,876 --> 01:13:16,310
- Right. / - They also did a lot of activities.

2038
01:13:16,310 --> 01:13:17,476
They did many activities.

2039
01:13:17,476 --> 01:13:19,476
- That's right. / - Let's check the costs.

2040
01:13:20,376 --> 01:13:22,610
Last week, Yoobom Nabom

2041
01:13:22,610 --> 01:13:25,676
spent $162.85.

2042
01:13:25,676 --> 01:13:28,676
Let's see how much Pink Sausage Tour spent.

2043
01:13:28,676 --> 01:13:30,976
Not including transportation...

2044
01:13:30,976 --> 01:13:31,943
Without transportation cost.

2045
01:13:31,943 --> 01:13:36,010
For our 2-day trip in Hadong,

2046
01:13:36,010 --> 01:13:38,143
Pink Sausage Tour spent...

2047
01:13:38,143 --> 01:13:38,843
How much?

2048
01:13:38,843 --> 01:13:40,543
- Per person. / - Per person!

2049
01:13:40,543 --> 01:13:43,843
$298.00

2050
01:13:45,010 --> 01:13:46,143
What?

2051
01:13:46,143 --> 01:13:47,310
Wait. Per person?

2052
01:13:49,076 --> 01:13:49,976
Per person?

2053
01:13:50,410 --> 01:13:51,110
Because...

2054
01:13:51,110 --> 01:13:52,210
People...

2055
01:13:52,210 --> 01:13:53,543
They rode the zip-line.

2056
01:13:53,543 --> 01:13:56,076
They wanted to show you too much.

2057
01:13:56,076 --> 01:13:57,676
They did the taxi tour.

2058
01:13:57,676 --> 01:13:59,643
- They didn't waste even a minute. / - Right.

2059
01:13:59,643 --> 01:14:01,010
- Even more. / - They packed their schedules.

2060
01:14:01,010 --> 01:14:01,843
They wanted to show you as much as possible.

2061
01:14:01,843 --> 01:14:04,276
- Even more... / - You don't have to spend $290.

2062
01:14:04,943 --> 01:14:07,343
We showed you everything so you choose.

2063
01:14:07,343 --> 01:14:08,310
Anyway.

2064
01:14:08,310 --> 01:14:10,043
The fact that they're talking so much...

2065
01:14:10,043 --> 01:14:11,676
- Means they're in shock. / - No...

2066
01:14:12,810 --> 01:14:13,410
They shocked.

2067
01:14:13,410 --> 01:14:14,976
You guys are shocked.

2068
01:14:15,810 --> 01:14:20,076
Will you go to Hadong planned by

2069
01:14:20,076 --> 01:14:21,243
Pink Sausage Tour?

2070
01:14:21,243 --> 01:14:22,776
Please vote.

2071
01:14:23,843 --> 01:14:26,810
(Spring flower trip of 20-year-olds to Jinju and Hadong)

2072
01:14:26,810 --> 01:14:30,310
(What will the judges choose?)

2073
01:14:31,443 --> 01:14:34,943
A girly trip with flowery memories

2074
01:14:34,943 --> 01:14:37,510
and charming tourist spots.

2075
01:14:37,510 --> 01:14:40,010
Will you choose Yoobom Nabom Trip

2076
01:14:40,010 --> 01:14:41,810
in Gwangyang and Suncheon?

2077
01:14:41,810 --> 01:14:44,310
Seasonal food, activities, cherry blossoms,

2078
01:14:44,310 --> 01:14:47,910
Korean beef, and cold noodles.

2079
01:14:47,910 --> 01:14:49,176
Nothing you can leave out.

2080
01:14:49,176 --> 01:14:51,376
Will you choose Pink Sausage Tour in Hadong?

2081
01:14:51,376 --> 01:14:54,476
What did the judges choose?

2082
01:14:54,476 --> 01:14:55,276
Their choice?

2083
01:14:57,443 --> 01:14:58,376
It's so...

2084
01:14:58,376 --> 01:15:00,743
This makes you nervous.

2085
01:15:00,743 --> 01:15:01,743
I really can't tell.

2086
01:15:01,743 --> 01:15:02,543
- Let's see. / - We'll see.

2087
01:15:03,643 --> 01:15:04,943
The last digit.

2088
01:15:05,976 --> 01:15:07,676
If the first digit is the same, it makes you nervous.

2089
01:15:07,676 --> 01:15:08,576
Last digit!

2090
01:15:08,576 --> 01:15:10,410
- This side is ours. / - It's one vote.

2091
01:15:10,410 --> 01:15:11,376
- Be the same! / - One vote difference

2092
01:15:11,376 --> 01:15:12,310
Same first digit!

2093
01:15:12,310 --> 01:15:14,143
- Same first digit! / - 8.

2094
01:15:14,143 --> 01:15:15,610
- 7, 8, 9. / - 8.

2095
01:15:15,610 --> 01:15:16,576
8.

2096
01:15:16,976 --> 01:15:17,676
8.

2097
01:15:18,276 --> 01:15:19,010
8.

2098
01:15:22,176 --> 01:15:25,876
(Jinju and Hadong wins with 86 votes!)

2099
01:15:26,276 --> 01:15:27,410
They won by 9 votes.

2100
01:15:28,376 --> 01:15:30,676
Woojin, say a word.

2101
01:15:30,676 --> 01:15:32,176
First...

2102
01:15:32,176 --> 01:15:33,510
I think they chose us

2103
01:15:33,510 --> 01:15:36,210
because they felt our happiness.

2104
01:15:36,210 --> 01:15:38,710
I hope they visit the same places...

2105
01:15:38,710 --> 01:15:40,810
- And feel happy too. / - That's nice.

2106
01:15:40,810 --> 01:15:43,310
Even though you lost, you had a good trip.

2107
01:15:43,310 --> 01:15:44,710
Yes, Yoobom Nabom did great too.

2108
01:15:44,710 --> 01:15:46,310
What's funny is that we rode Bus 77,

2109
01:15:46,310 --> 01:15:48,043
What's funny is that we rode Bus 77,

2110
01:15:48,043 --> 01:15:49,676
and we got 77 votes.

2111
01:15:50,676 --> 01:15:52,410
I think we're really lucky.

2112
01:15:52,410 --> 01:15:53,143
Seriously...

2113
01:15:53,143 --> 01:15:54,876
You should've taken Bus 100.

2114
01:15:55,810 --> 01:15:58,043
Special host Jooe, what did you think?

2115
01:15:58,843 --> 01:16:01,510
I came here as a special host

2116
01:16:01,510 --> 01:16:03,443
but being here together,

2117
01:16:03,443 --> 01:16:06,243
it felt like I went on the healing trip with them.

2118
01:16:06,243 --> 01:16:08,110
I'm so grateful.

2119
01:16:08,110 --> 01:16:10,210
Next time,

2120
01:16:10,210 --> 01:16:11,410
I'd like to be

2121
01:16:11,410 --> 01:16:12,676
the trip designer.

2122
01:16:12,676 --> 01:16:13,443
- Yeah. / - You must.

2123
01:16:13,443 --> 01:16:14,410
Please invite me back.

2124
01:16:14,410 --> 01:16:15,410
Alright.

2125
01:16:15,410 --> 01:16:17,443
We've always been doing it

2126
01:16:17,443 --> 01:16:18,343
and we'll still continue.

2127
01:16:18,343 --> 01:16:19,876
Next week is another special.

2128
01:16:19,876 --> 01:16:22,010
Next week will be very special.

2129
01:16:22,710 --> 01:16:24,110
We had the domestic

2130
01:16:24,110 --> 01:16:25,376
flower festival specials for 2 weeks.

2131
01:16:25,376 --> 01:16:28,443
Next week, we'll check out international festivals.

2132
01:16:28,443 --> 01:16:29,943
We'll have

2133
01:16:29,943 --> 01:16:32,443
3 weeks worth of international festivals.

2134
01:16:32,443 --> 01:16:33,410
There must be so many of them.

2135
01:16:33,410 --> 01:16:34,476
We'll keep having festivals.

2136
01:16:34,476 --> 01:16:35,976
Please enjoy the festivals.

2137
01:16:35,976 --> 01:16:37,943
We'll come back next week.

2138
01:16:37,943 --> 01:16:39,743
The world is your school. Life is a journey.

2139
01:16:39,743 --> 01:16:42,243
Battle Trip!

2140
01:16:42,243 --> 01:16:43,910
Thank you.

2141
01:16:47,776 --> 01:16:48,710
(Next week)

2142
01:16:48,710 --> 01:16:51,643
Myanmar feels like a world of mystery.

2143
01:16:51,643 --> 01:16:52,743
It really makes you feel refreshed.

2144
01:16:53,276 --> 01:16:54,510
Sobang Tour!

2145
01:16:57,276 --> 01:16:59,043
The colors are so pretty.

2146
01:17:00,176 --> 01:17:01,043
My word.

2147
01:17:01,043 --> 01:17:02,210
It's so nice.

2148
01:17:02,210 --> 01:17:03,710
The sun is still rising.

2149
01:17:03,710 --> 01:17:04,543
It's like a dream.

2150
01:17:04,543 --> 01:17:05,743
This is so scary.

2151
01:17:05,743 --> 01:17:07,376
It's no joke.

2152
01:17:07,376 --> 01:17:08,076
It's so pretty.

2153
01:17:09,276 --> 01:17:10,176
Let's relax.

2154
01:17:10,776 --> 01:17:12,976
Makes us relax.

2155
01:17:12,976 --> 01:17:14,510
It'll be fun.

2156
01:17:14,510 --> 01:17:15,643
Look forward to it.

2157
01:17:16,376 --> 01:17:32,976
("Time for the Moon Night" by GFRIEND)
