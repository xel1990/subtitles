00:00:01,474 --> 00:00:04,874
- Let's go. / - Let's go, let's go.

(Play Day, Rest Day) 

3
00:00:08,074 --> 00:00:08,974
Amazing. 

4
00:00:09,907 --> 00:00:10,807
It's good. 

5
00:00:11,774 --> 00:00:12,740
Jin... 

6
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:14,174
It's not over yet. 

7
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:18,140
(Wan Jun Tour never stops) 

8
00:00:18,574 --> 00:00:19,840
Saved in my heart. 

9
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:21,774
I can't believe I'm seeing such a sight in Jeju-do. 

10
00:00:21,774 --> 00:00:23,374
Check out the waves. 

11
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:27,240

12
00:00:29,107 --> 00:00:31,974

(Special host, Dayoung of WJSN) 

16
00:00:39,174 --> 00:00:40,207
Travel is war. 

17
00:00:40,207 --> 00:00:42,374
Battle Trip. 

18
00:00:44,774 --> 00:00:46,474
Continuing from last week... 

19
00:00:47,274 --> 00:00:50,074
The 2018 newest edition of Jeju-do. 

20
00:00:50,407 --> 00:00:52,807
We have two teams of trip planners here. 

21
00:00:52,807 --> 00:00:54,940
- Welcome back. / - Nice to see you again. 

22
00:00:55,707 --> 00:00:59,240
We have our 100 impartial judges 

23
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:01,174
who will vote on today's trips. 

24
00:01:01,174 --> 00:01:02,374
- Welcome. / - Welcome. 

25
00:01:02,374 --> 00:01:03,740
(100 judges in the audience) 

26
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:06,174
A lot of them voted for our team last week. 

27
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:08,340
I'd like to thank them again. 

28
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:10,440
Dayoung is... 

29
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:12,407
- From Chujado. / - That's right. 

30
00:01:12,407 --> 00:01:14,240
- She knows a lot about Jeju-do. / - Yes, I do. 

31
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,440
What if you're the one to go to Jeju-do? 

32
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:18,507
- Yes. / - How would you plan your trip? 

33
00:01:18,807 --> 00:01:20,240
To be honest, 

34
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:22,507
a lot of people know about Jeju-do, 

35
00:01:22,507 --> 00:01:25,307
but most of them don't know about Chujado. 

36
00:01:25,307 --> 00:01:26,540
- I've heard of the name though. / - Yes. 

37
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:28,107
It's a good place for fishing. 

38
00:01:28,107 --> 00:01:30,940
Is there a good place to go in Chujado? 

39
00:01:31,774 --> 00:01:33,274
- In Chujado... / - Yes. 

40
00:01:33,274 --> 00:01:35,307
- There's Navarone Cliff. / - Navarone Cliff? 

41
00:01:35,307 --> 00:01:36,674
Yes, it's called Navarone Cliff. 

42
00:01:36,674 --> 00:01:38,740
It's so cool. 

43
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:41,974
After 40 minutes to an hour of trekking... 

44
00:01:41,974 --> 00:01:44,007
- You can enjoy the great views. / - It sounds cool. 

45
00:01:44,007 --> 00:01:45,074
It's really beautiful. 

46
00:01:45,074 --> 00:01:46,274
Jeju-do is good, 

47
00:01:46,274 --> 00:01:47,940
but the nearby islands are also beautiful. 

48
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:49,207
Udo is amazing. 

49
00:01:49,207 --> 00:01:50,907
- Right. / - And Gapado is also great. 

50
00:01:50,907 --> 00:01:52,274
Gapado is good 

51
00:01:52,274 --> 00:01:53,274
in April and May. 

52
00:01:53,274 --> 00:01:55,474
You should call us again for the next special. 

53
00:01:55,474 --> 00:01:57,007
- For the islands? / - Island tour. 

54
00:01:57,007 --> 00:01:59,774
- I'd love that. / - It sounds so fun. 

55
00:02:00,307 --> 00:02:03,374
We watched Wan Jun Tour's trip last week. 

56
00:02:03,374 --> 00:02:06,140
- And it actually rained a lot. / - Right. 

57
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:07,640
Despite the weather condition... 

58
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:09,807
- They had a great trip. / - It was really good. 

59
00:02:09,807 --> 00:02:11,874
They're not my team, but the trip was amazing. 

60
00:02:11,874 --> 00:02:14,607
- I was envious. / - Do you accept the defeat? 

61
00:02:14,607 --> 00:02:16,074
Do you accept the defeat? 

62
00:02:16,074 --> 00:02:19,074
- No. / - It will be determined by a vote. 

63
00:02:19,074 --> 00:02:21,640
I think Baekho Tour is a little dejected now. 

64
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:23,374
- That's not true. / - Baekho. 

65
00:02:23,374 --> 00:02:24,840
How was the weather during your trip? 

66
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:26,574
Actually, 

67
00:02:26,574 --> 00:02:28,007
we bring rain clouds with us. 

68
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:30,474
- Some people do that. / - That's not good. 

69
00:02:30,474 --> 00:02:32,540
And we went to Jeju-do on the same day. 

70
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:33,974
- That's right. / - So... 

71
00:02:33,974 --> 00:02:36,107
We were in a different place in the same weather. 

72
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:39,707
So it was cloudy one day and sunny the next day? 

73
00:02:39,707 --> 00:02:42,074
The weather wasn't so good for the two days. 

74
00:02:42,274 --> 00:02:44,040
It wasn't quite sunny. 

75
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:46,140
We will show them we can still win though. 

76
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:48,207
- Right, it was good though. / - Alright. 

77
00:02:48,207 --> 00:02:50,107
You are the Aewol Prince. 

78
00:02:50,107 --> 00:02:52,007
You shouldn't be like this. 

79
00:02:52,007 --> 00:02:53,474
- That sounds strange. / - Aewol Prince. 

80
00:02:53,474 --> 00:02:56,407
He's the Aewol Prince. He's an expert in Jeju-do. 

81
00:02:56,407 --> 00:02:58,607
Can you tell us some general knowledge? 

82
00:02:58,607 --> 00:02:59,774
- We're curious about it. / - Yes. 

83
00:02:59,774 --> 00:03:00,940
- Aewol Prince. / - Alright. 

84
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:02,607
There are two kinds of dol hareubang. 

85
00:03:02,774 --> 00:03:04,240
- What? / - Huh? 

86
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:06,140
- Really? / - If you look at it carefully... 

87
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:07,740
One hand is placed higher than the other. 

88
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:09,740
Some have their left hands higher. 

89
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:11,540
- And others, their right hand. / - I didn't know that. 

90
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:13,007
Are they left-handed and right-handed? 

91
00:03:13,007 --> 00:03:14,740
Which one is genuine? 

92
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:16,674
- They both are genuine. / - Oh, really? 

93
00:03:16,674 --> 00:03:18,674
The one with its right hand on top is... 

94
00:03:18,674 --> 00:03:21,240
The right hand is for holding the brush when you write. 

95
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:24,240
So they are a civil servant and military officer. 

96
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:26,040
The one with the right hand on top 

97
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,274
is a civil servant. 

98
00:03:27,274 --> 00:03:28,540
And the one with the left hand on top 

99
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:29,174
is a military officer? 

100
00:03:29,174 --> 00:03:31,107
People say you will have a son 

101
00:03:31,107 --> 00:03:34,174
if you touch the nose of dol hareubang. 

102
00:03:34,174 --> 00:03:37,440
If you want to have a smart son, 

103
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,007
you should touch the nose of one... 

104
00:03:39,007 --> 00:03:40,874
- A civil servant. / - With the right hand on top. 

105
00:03:41,174 --> 00:03:42,774
What about your mother? 

106
00:03:42,774 --> 00:03:44,640
Which one did she touch? 

107
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:45,840
My mom... 

108
00:03:47,207 --> 00:03:48,274
I guess she touched... 

109
00:03:48,274 --> 00:03:50,940
- The left-handed one. / - I think he's right. 

110
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:52,640
Is there one with both hands on top? 

111
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:53,307
That's a fake. 

112
00:03:53,307 --> 00:03:54,874
Really? 

113
00:03:55,374 --> 00:03:56,507
That's a fake one? 

114
00:03:56,507 --> 00:03:57,640
There's no such thing. 

115
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:59,174
This is a fake, everyone. 

116
00:03:59,174 --> 00:04:01,707
It should have only one hand on top. 

117
00:04:01,707 --> 00:04:02,774
He's so good. 

118
00:04:02,774 --> 00:04:04,707
He knows something that we didn't know. 

119
00:04:04,707 --> 00:04:07,074
- I feel ashamed. / - I'm relieved now. 

120
00:04:07,607 --> 00:04:09,940
- By the way... / - Is that true? 

121
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:11,840
It was JR's first time in Jeju-do? 

122
00:04:12,074 --> 00:04:13,340
- Was it your first trip? / - Well... 

123
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:15,140
I've gone abroad 

124
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:18,207
for TV shows and concerts before. 

125
00:04:18,374 --> 00:04:21,240
But it was my first time going somewhere for a trip. 

126
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:23,040
I think he's a homebody. 

127
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,307
- Right, I like to stay at home... / - Am I right? 

128
00:04:24,307 --> 00:04:25,340
Playing video games. 

129
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:28,207
- He likes to play games. / - I rarely go out. 

130
00:04:28,207 --> 00:04:30,407
And I didn't like to travel. 

131
00:04:30,407 --> 00:04:32,740
That's new. Dongwan didn't like boiled chicken. 

132
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:34,574
And you don't even like traveling. 

133
00:04:34,574 --> 00:04:35,940
But... 

134
00:04:36,274 --> 00:04:38,874
Baekho planned such a fun trip. 

135
00:04:38,874 --> 00:04:40,140
I really enjoyed my first trip. 

136
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:41,840
Are you going to start traveling now? 

137
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:44,307
If I have a chance to go on a trip, 

138
00:04:44,307 --> 00:04:47,307
I'll take a trip planner with me. 

139
00:04:47,307 --> 00:04:49,640
- You need someone to guide you. / - You two can go. 

140
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:50,840
And I'll go with Baekho. 

141
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:54,074
Didn't you design one day each? 

142
00:04:54,074 --> 00:04:54,907
No, for us... 

143
00:04:54,907 --> 00:04:56,107
- I planned it all. / - It's Baekho Tour. 

144
00:04:56,107 --> 00:04:57,840
Since it's Baekho Tour. 

145
00:04:58,274 --> 00:04:59,607
- That's interesting. / - Let's begin then. 

146
00:04:59,607 --> 00:05:01,907
Is there anything we should focus on? 

147
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:03,907
On the first day... 

148
00:05:04,207 --> 00:05:07,007
We went to the western part, where Baekho grew up. 

149
00:05:07,007 --> 00:05:08,674
We went to Aewol. 

150
00:05:08,674 --> 00:05:10,807
We had a lot of fun playing in the water there. 

151
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,440
Dongwan had fun playing in the water last week. 

152
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,274
Didn't you take off your shirt to play in the water? 

153
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:19,540
(Dongwan took off his shirt last week) 

154
00:05:19,907 --> 00:05:21,974
(He dove into the water for perpetual youth) 

155
00:05:21,974 --> 00:05:23,240
Did you not take it off? 

156
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,674
No, we didn't. 

157
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:26,607
I regret it now. 

158
00:05:26,607 --> 00:05:27,840
That's what we want to see. 

159
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:29,307
On the second day, 

160
00:05:29,307 --> 00:05:32,440
we traveled around the eastern part of Jeju City, 

161
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:33,607
which is really popular these days. 

162
00:05:33,607 --> 00:05:36,540
For that area, I had to look up information. 

163
00:05:36,874 --> 00:05:38,740
- So I didn't know much about it... / - Yes. 

164
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:40,374
But we had a lot of fun. 

165
00:05:40,374 --> 00:05:41,507
Did anything like this happen? 

166
00:05:41,507 --> 00:05:43,474
Didn't you run into one of your friends during the trip? 

167
00:05:43,474 --> 00:05:45,574
- You could come across one. / - It's your hometown. 

168
00:05:45,574 --> 00:05:46,840
Baekho! 

169
00:05:47,407 --> 00:05:48,407
What's the dialect? 

170
00:05:48,407 --> 00:05:49,440
(Teasing him) 

171
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:51,074
When did you come? 

172
00:05:51,074 --> 00:05:52,574
- Gosh. / - I'm good, right? 

173
00:05:52,574 --> 00:05:54,607
I don't think so. 

174
00:05:55,807 --> 00:05:57,307
He's objective. 

175
00:05:57,307 --> 00:05:58,440
Baekho is objective. 

176
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:00,840
Can you talk with Dayoung in Jeju-do dialect? 

177
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:02,040
- Can you do that? / - Oh, right. 

178
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,507
Have a talk with her. 

179
00:06:03,507 --> 00:06:05,240
- Did you eat? / - Yes. 

180
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:07,107
- What did you eat? / - I... 

181
00:06:07,107 --> 00:06:08,774
I had a box lunch. 

182
00:06:08,774 --> 00:06:10,040
Really? Was it good? 

183
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:12,274
- Yes. / - Let's eat together next time. 

184
00:06:12,274 --> 00:06:13,840
- They're so good. / - Good. 

185
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,207
Dayoung is really good. 

186
00:06:15,207 --> 00:06:16,874
But Baekho seemed flustered. 

187
00:06:16,874 --> 00:06:18,374
He's sweating a lot. 

188
00:06:18,374 --> 00:06:22,007
That's because I lived in Jeju-do for a long time 

189
00:06:22,007 --> 00:06:23,674
and I'm younger than him. 

190
00:06:24,207 --> 00:06:25,174
Alright then. 

191
00:06:26,574 --> 00:06:27,640
So thoughtful. 

192
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:28,907
- Why are you sweating? / - So thoughtful. 

193
00:06:28,907 --> 00:06:30,340
He sweats whenever he talks. 

194
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:32,274
Alright. Let's begin then. 

195
00:06:33,107 --> 00:06:34,374
- We can win. / - Right. 

196
00:06:34,374 --> 00:06:35,607
- Can we win? / - Yes, we can. 

197
00:06:35,607 --> 00:06:37,407
Let's start by shouting the team name. 

198
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:38,840
- You know it, right? / - Yes. 

199
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:40,707
- You will sweat again. / - Are you ready? 

200
00:06:40,707 --> 00:06:43,840
- Open. / - And straightforward. 

201
00:06:44,007 --> 00:06:46,707

Let's watch. 

203
00:06:51,007 --> 00:06:53,507
(They're one of the hottest idol groups) 

204
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:54,740
It's NU'EST W. 

205
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:58,174
(JR and Baekho of NU'EST W) 

206
00:06:59,007 --> 00:07:00,374
(They feel excited from the beginning) 

207
00:07:00,374 --> 00:07:01,774
(First trip) 

208
00:07:01,774 --> 00:07:03,907
(First activity) 

209
00:07:03,907 --> 00:07:08,640
(First food) 

210
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:10,074
I want to eat it again. 

211
00:07:11,874 --> 00:07:15,707
(He shows his whimsical charm) 

212
00:07:15,874 --> 00:07:17,807
This is my first trip. 

213
00:07:17,807 --> 00:07:19,607
(A complete trip novice, JR) 

214
00:07:19,874 --> 00:07:20,574
- Wait. / - So young. 

215
00:07:20,574 --> 00:07:22,240
- So sweet. / - Please calm down a little. 

216
00:07:24,807 --> 00:07:27,240
(He's from Aewol, Jeju-do) 

217
00:07:27,607 --> 00:07:28,340
I was born here and grew up here. 

218
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:30,340
I know this place well. 

219
00:07:32,474 --> 00:07:33,940
What's that? 

220
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:35,874
- Prince. / - He does look like a prince. 

221
00:07:35,874 --> 00:07:38,474
There are no thieves here. 

222
00:07:38,474 --> 00:07:40,140
Stonewall making is an actual job. 

223
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:43,540
That number there... That's the regional number. 

224
00:07:44,274 --> 00:07:47,740
(He's not shy) 

225
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:49,074
It's stuck. 

226
00:07:50,207 --> 00:07:51,707
They did lipstick challenge. 

227
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:54,007
The nickname suits him well. 

228
00:07:54,007 --> 00:07:55,307
Aewol Prince. 

229
00:07:55,307 --> 00:07:57,440
Planned by Baekho. 

230
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,640
It's Baekho Tour. 

231
00:07:59,274 --> 00:08:02,107
(Jeju City, Seogwipo City) 

232
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:08,374
(The best drive along the coastal road of Aewol) 

233
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:17,974
It's here. 

234
00:08:18,107 --> 00:08:19,240
It looks delicious. 

235
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,374
What's that? 

236
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:25,440
(The new trendy taste of Jeju-do) 

237
00:08:25,674 --> 00:08:27,640
SHINHWA ate instant noodles and kimchi stew. 

238
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:29,307
It's on another level. 

239
00:08:29,307 --> 00:08:30,707
We're not going to lose. 

240
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:34,907
(The taste of Jeju-do makes him take a bow) 

241
00:08:36,274 --> 00:08:37,474
It'll be more fun. 

242
00:08:37,474 --> 00:08:40,474
(New activities) 

243
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:42,307
What's that? 

244
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:43,607
What? 

245
00:08:43,607 --> 00:08:45,207
What's this? 

246
00:08:46,507 --> 00:08:48,240
Baekho. 

247
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:50,274
Tour. 

248
00:08:50,674 --> 00:08:52,707
(Baekho Tour's trip to Jeju-do begins now) 

249
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:56,807
- Wait a minute. / - The judges are too biased. 

250
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:59,474
Why don't we take the vote first? 

251
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,174
The audience seems excited now. 

252
00:09:02,507 --> 00:09:05,774

The neighborhood I know very well. 

282
00:10:20,474 --> 00:10:21,474
We're going to go to this place. 

283

(His face tells how it tastes) 

348
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:16,640
It's good, isn't it? 

349
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:20,974
(He stands up) 

350
00:13:21,174 --> 00:13:22,440
He approves. 

351
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:23,907
Enjoy your food. 

352
00:13:25,974 --> 00:13:27,440
Doesn't it taste like spicy chewy noodles? 

353
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:28,974
It looks so delicious. 

354
00:13:28,974 --> 00:13:31,107
It seems like they used medium-thick noodles. 

355
00:13:31,107 --> 00:13:32,374
You're right. 

356
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:35,640
It's not like the noodles you eat with seasoned whelk. 

357
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:37,640
Cold raw fish soup. 

358
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:39,540
(It's time to try abalone cold raw fish soup of Jeju-do) 

359
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:41,407
- My goodness. / - Abalone cold raw fish soup. 

360
00:13:41,407 --> 00:13:43,974
I'm glad I stuffed myself before we started shooting. 

361
00:13:44,507 --> 00:13:45,874
- Just to avoid a hard time here. / - Yes. 

362
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:49,107
I will eat cold raw fish soup as soon as I get off. 

363
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:52,240
(Abalone cold raw fish soup looks so appetizing) 

364
00:13:53,607 --> 00:13:55,740
(His frowning face shows how tasty it is) 

365
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:57,440
- Is it a pass? / - It's a pass. 

366
00:14:01,274 --> 00:14:06,340
(Will JR give it a pass as well?) 

367
00:14:07,074 --> 00:14:07,674
How is it? 

368
00:14:10,007 --> 00:14:13,307
(He shakes Baekho's hand in awe) 

369
00:14:13,307 --> 00:14:14,207
This is a pass. 

370
00:14:14,207 --> 00:14:17,540
- He really wanted to eat it. / - He's thankful. 

371
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:19,340
I'm thankful that he brought me to such a place. 

372
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:19,807
Right, right. 

373
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:22,440
JR has never been on a trip... 

374
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:24,240
And cold raw fish soup greatly impressed him. 

375
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,474
(I'm glad he likes it) 

376
00:14:25,474 --> 00:14:26,674
Good. 

377
00:14:27,507 --> 00:14:29,174
I like the texture of the food. 

378
00:14:29,174 --> 00:14:30,207
(Abalone is crunchy in the mouth) 

379
00:14:30,207 --> 00:14:33,207
- The texture of the abalone? / - Yes, it's crunchy. 

380
00:14:33,674 --> 00:14:36,740
- It doesn't taste so strong. / - It looks so tasty. 

381
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:38,374
I loved the texture of the abalone. 

382
00:14:38,374 --> 00:14:41,574
- It's sour. / - It's a hangover dish for me. 

383
00:14:42,107 --> 00:14:43,674
It's not the main dish for me. 

384
00:14:43,674 --> 00:14:45,707
I would eat it the next day after I drank. 

385
00:14:45,707 --> 00:14:48,040
- This and soju make me feel better. / - Right. 

386
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:49,774
- It makes your stomach numb. / - It's good. 

387
00:14:49,774 --> 00:14:51,907
How about we mix the dishes with rice? 

388
00:14:51,907 --> 00:14:53,174
Shall we? Now? 

389
00:14:53,174 --> 00:14:54,274
(It's time to mix rice in the cold raw fish soup) 

390
00:14:55,174 --> 00:14:56,874
My gosh, it looks too delicious. 

391
00:14:56,874 --> 00:14:58,740
- That's your breakfast, right? / - Yes, it's breakfast. 

392
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:00,807
- We had that when we arrived. / - They put rice in it. 

393
00:15:01,307 --> 00:15:03,540
Those who like cold raw fish soup always mix rice in it. 

394
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:04,574
(It looks so good even at a glance) 

395
00:15:04,574 --> 00:15:07,307
- Goodness, it looks so good. / - I can't imagine it. 

396
00:15:10,307 --> 00:15:14,607
(He takes a bite first) 

397
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:26,274
(Tell me how it is) 

398
00:15:27,874 --> 00:15:28,940
Why are you not saying anything? 

399
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:29,774
Because it's too delicious. 

400
00:15:29,774 --> 00:15:31,374
It's rude to talk in front of... 

401
00:15:31,374 --> 00:15:33,074
- Yes. / - Good food. 

402
00:15:33,074 --> 00:15:34,240
You're right. 

403
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:36,174
(It was so good that no words were needed) 

404
00:15:36,507 --> 00:15:38,540
It was a great idea to mix rice in it. 

405
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:39,974
It's delicious with rice. 

406
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:43,340
Their signature dish is abalone cold raw fish soup. 

407
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:45,740
What's interesting is that you have to cook 

408
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:48,807
fried eggs yourself if you want to eat it. 

409
00:15:48,807 --> 00:15:50,274
- That sounds fun. / - It's unlimited. 

410
00:15:50,274 --> 00:15:51,974
Not many restaurants offer... 

411
00:15:51,974 --> 00:15:53,207
- Unlimited eggs these days. / - I know. 

412
00:15:53,774 --> 00:15:55,107
It's delicious with rice. 

413
00:15:55,107 --> 00:16:00,407
(It's the perfect breakfast) 

414
00:16:00,407 --> 00:16:04,307
(They start to dig in) 

415
00:16:05,107 --> 00:16:11,274
(Baekho from Aewol and JR from Gangneung love it) 

416
00:16:13,807 --> 00:16:17,640
(The harmony of refreshing soup and fresh abalone) 

417
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:20,607
(This is the perfect menu for breakfast) 

418
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:24,807
(They drink the soup out of the bowl) 

419
00:16:24,807 --> 00:16:26,774
- They drink it out of the bowl. / - This is amazing. 

420
00:16:26,874 --> 00:16:29,207
You two are young yet you're quiet when you eat. 

421
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:31,540
We don't talk much. 

422
00:16:32,207 --> 00:16:33,240
I'm so full. 

423
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:35,474
Keep your eyes forward. 

424
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:37,307
(It's time for JR to rate the food) 

425
00:16:37,307 --> 00:16:40,240
Keep your eyes forward. 

426
00:16:41,107 --> 00:16:42,474
Eyes to the front. 

427
00:16:42,474 --> 00:16:43,874
(JR will rate the food behind Baekho) 

428
00:16:43,874 --> 00:16:45,107
Baekho. 

429
00:16:45,407 --> 00:16:47,774
The restaurant you brought me to... 

430
00:16:47,774 --> 00:16:48,640
What in the world are you doing? 

431
00:16:49,107 --> 00:16:49,740
He kept doing that. 

432
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:52,174
He kept doing that. 

433
00:16:52,174 --> 00:16:54,140
(Cringe) 

434
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:55,307
I can't stand this! 

435
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:58,040
Hey! What are you doing? 

436
00:16:58,040 --> 00:16:59,374
What about it? I like it. 

437
00:16:59,374 --> 00:17:00,540
- What's the problem? / - I lost my appetite. 

438
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:02,940
The restaurant you brought me to... 

439
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:04,807
(He secretly whispers to the stuffed animal) 

440
00:17:04,807 --> 00:17:06,974
It was our first course. 

441
00:17:06,974 --> 00:17:09,440
This was my first cold raw fish soup this year... 

442
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:12,674
And it was very successful. 

443
00:17:12,674 --> 00:17:15,007
I feel like I will want to eat more in the future. 

444
00:17:15,007 --> 00:17:17,674
The first course was a big success. 

445
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:20,640
Thank you. 

446
00:17:21,474 --> 00:17:23,107
It was my first time traveling. 

447
00:17:23,107 --> 00:17:25,074
He told me to be honest with the evaluation. 

448
00:17:25,074 --> 00:17:26,374
Why couldn't you just tell him in person? 

449
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:34,774
(40 minutes by car from the restaurant to Aewol Port) 

450
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:41,507
How does it feel to travel to your hometown? 

451
00:17:41,507 --> 00:17:43,274
- I'm curious. / - It's nice. 

452
00:17:43,274 --> 00:17:45,707
Well, coming here has always been 

453
00:17:45,707 --> 00:17:47,840
visiting my home, not traveling. 

454
00:17:48,074 --> 00:17:51,640
But traveling to a familiar place... 

455
00:17:52,207 --> 00:17:53,774
Actually feels quite nice. 

456
00:17:54,674 --> 00:17:57,207
When it comes to cars at least, we won. 

457
00:17:57,207 --> 00:17:58,874
Your car is a regular sedan. 

458
00:17:58,874 --> 00:18:00,474
- And our car was a convertible. / - It was rainy. 

459
00:18:00,474 --> 00:18:02,107
You must drive a convertible on a coastal road. 

460
00:18:02,107 --> 00:18:03,274
He's right. 

461
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:07,174
Now, we're on Aewol Coastal Road. 

462
00:18:08,007 --> 00:18:09,274
- It's nice here. / - Yeah. 

463
00:18:09,274 --> 00:18:10,907
(Although their car isn't a convertible, this road is open) 

464
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:14,374
It usually has a beautiful color. 

465
00:18:15,107 --> 00:18:18,140
When it's sunny, it's emerald green. 

466
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:19,340
- The sea? / - Yes. 

467
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:20,940
It's so beautiful. 

468
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:23,007
The sea is emerald green? 

469
00:18:23,007 --> 00:18:24,540
(On sunny days, you can see the emerald ocean) 

470
00:18:26,607 --> 00:18:29,040
(Aewol Coastal Road is beautiful on sunny days) 

471
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:31,440
It's really beautiful here. 

472
00:18:33,374 --> 00:18:34,574
The color of the ocean is so pretty. 

473
00:18:36,674 --> 00:18:39,374
I could see this view from the junior high, 

474
00:18:39,374 --> 00:18:41,207
from my classroom window. 

475
00:18:41,807 --> 00:18:43,374
- From your junior high? / - Yes. 

476
00:18:43,374 --> 00:18:44,774
My school is right here. It's near here. 

477
00:18:44,774 --> 00:18:46,107
You could see the sea from school? 

478
00:18:46,107 --> 00:18:47,240
I could see it from the classroom 

479
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:48,674
when I turned my head to the right. 

480
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:50,540
This is the junior high school I graduated from. 

481
00:18:51,307 --> 00:18:52,074
It's here. 

482
00:18:52,074 --> 00:18:53,907
This is the junior high you actually went to? 

483
00:18:53,907 --> 00:18:55,974
Yes, this is the junior high I actually went to. 

484
00:18:56,674 --> 00:18:59,474
??Along the ranges of Hallasan ?? 

485
00:18:59,474 --> 00:19:01,474
How do you still remember the song? 

486
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:07,340
(This cheerful boy who went to this junior high school) 

487
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:09,307
(Became a reliable trip planner after 8 years) 

488
00:19:09,307 --> 00:19:10,540
He does look reliable. 

489
00:19:11,374 --> 00:19:12,540
He really was. 

490
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:13,607
(Trip Planner) 

491
00:19:13,607 --> 00:19:16,507
Since he doesn't drink, he was the best as a driver. 

492
00:19:16,507 --> 00:19:17,974
(What is the next stop on their itinerary?) 

493
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:20,607
What do you think about doing some activities? 

494
00:19:20,607 --> 00:19:23,374
- Activities? We'll do activities. / - Activities. 

495
00:19:23,374 --> 00:19:25,640
There's a new activity facility around my house. 

496
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:27,974
- Where is that? / - It's awesome that he lives nearby. 

497
00:19:27,974 --> 00:19:29,074
It's in Eoeum. 

498
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:33,274
- Is this it? / - Hey, you got it. 

499
00:19:33,474 --> 00:19:36,407
- They'll roll the ball? / - Yes, there's a person inside. 

500
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:39,774
I like rolling. 

501
00:19:39,774 --> 00:19:41,674
You do? Then it's awesome. 

502
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:43,107
(Baekho Tour Day 1) 

503
00:19:43,107 --> 00:19:45,007
We went towards the mountain. 

504
00:19:45,007 --> 00:19:48,840
(20 minutes by car from Aewol Port to the facility) 

505
00:19:50,074 --> 00:19:52,740
It's raining hard. It keeps pouring. 

506
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:53,740
(It keeps on raining) 

507
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:56,740
- I'm worried about this though. / - What? 

508
00:19:56,740 --> 00:19:57,974
What if the facility is closed? 

509
00:19:57,974 --> 00:19:59,640
It'll be even more fun. 

510
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:02,340
- I'm looking forward to riding it. / - Right? 

511
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:03,707
- Yes. / - Me too. 

512
00:20:03,707 --> 00:20:05,574
(Me too) 

513
00:20:05,574 --> 00:20:06,640
- We're here. / - My gosh. 

514
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,107
This would be more fun on rainy days. 

515
00:20:08,107 --> 00:20:11,274
- We've arrived. / - We're here. 

516
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:14,507
(Luckily, the balls are rolling down without problems) 

517
00:20:14,907 --> 00:20:17,874
- There's a track for that. / - Yes, there's a track. 

518
00:20:18,807 --> 00:20:21,040
- That looks fun. / - I prepared everything I could. 

519
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:24,240
I can see that. My gosh, it's really huge. 

520
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:26,640
- The balls are massive. / - Yes. 

521
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:29,974
(A newly rising activity in Jeju City) 

522
00:20:30,874 --> 00:20:34,407
Inside the ball was much more fun... 

523
00:20:34,407 --> 00:20:35,840
- That's right. / - Than we expected. 

524
00:20:36,707 --> 00:20:39,174
(Zorb Course, $27 per person) 

525
00:20:39,174 --> 00:20:41,674
(2 people roll down a 300m hill with seatbelts on) 

526
00:20:43,374 --> 00:20:44,974
(Big Ball Course, $33 per person) 

527
00:20:44,974 --> 00:20:47,140
(Maximum of 4 people inside the ball with water) 

528
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:50,040
(And roll down the hill like riding a water slide) 

529
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:53,840
(Baekho Tour decides to experience both courses) 

530
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:55,474
You can try both courses. 

531
00:20:55,474 --> 00:20:56,574
If you want to try both... 

532
00:20:56,574 --> 00:20:59,240
- You only have to pay $55 per person. / - My gosh. 

533
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:01,840
- That would be nice for couples. / - Yes. 

534
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:04,174
I think it'd be great for the two who want to be a couple. 

535
00:21:04,574 --> 00:21:06,907
- That's right. / - It must be more than two people. 

536
00:21:06,907 --> 00:21:08,074
I prepared one more thing. 

537
00:21:08,774 --> 00:21:10,207
For this big ball activity. 

538
00:21:11,074 --> 00:21:12,240
I stayed up all night to prepare this. 

539
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:14,074
- You stayed up all night? / - Yes, you bet. 

540
00:21:14,074 --> 00:21:16,707
- It's in my pocket. / - Okay. 

541
00:21:16,907 --> 00:21:19,707
(It's a lipstick) 

542
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:22,507
I thought he was doing a heart. That scared me. 

543
00:21:22,974 --> 00:21:25,174
Our program is known for the lipstick challenge. 

544
00:21:26,074 --> 00:21:29,040
(Changseob from BTOB did it) 

545
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:31,207
(Eunkwang also did it) 

546
00:21:32,007 --> 00:21:33,374
We put on the lipstick too. 

547
00:21:33,374 --> 00:21:36,474
- Sikyung put it on nicely. / - Right. 

548
00:21:37,474 --> 00:21:40,440
(The lipstick challenge, the custom of Battle Trip) 

549
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:42,407
(It brings back memories) 

550
00:21:42,407 --> 00:21:44,874
- That was really scary. / - No, it was fun. 

551
00:21:44,874 --> 00:21:45,907
Let's play for something. 

552
00:21:46,574 --> 00:21:48,507
- You do this too often. / - Let's do it. 

553
00:21:48,507 --> 00:21:50,774
- That will motivate me to do it. / - Okay. 

554
00:21:50,774 --> 00:21:51,807
What should we bet? 

555
00:21:53,507 --> 00:21:54,574
The loser buys dinner. 

556
00:21:55,207 --> 00:21:56,574
- Anything? / - Anything. 

557
00:21:56,574 --> 00:21:58,974
- Let's go. Are you confident? / - Let's do it. 

558
00:21:58,974 --> 00:22:00,407
- We'll use our own money. / - Are you sure? 

559
00:22:00,407 --> 00:22:02,107
- We'll pay out of our own pockets. / - Yes, of course. 

560
00:22:02,107 --> 00:22:04,240
- Let's do this. / - Are you confident about it? 

561
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:05,440
- I can do this. / - You know... 

562
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:07,640
- You can't take back what you said. / - Of course not. 

563
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:09,840
- I will never do that. / - Don't give me excuses. 

564
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:11,807
Gosh, I won't do that. 

565
00:22:12,307 --> 00:22:14,307
That's the longest track in Asia. 

566
00:22:14,307 --> 00:22:15,507
It's 300m long. 

567
00:22:16,107 --> 00:22:17,940
- It's quite long. / - 300m? 

568
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:19,940
You will roll for a good amount of time. 

569
00:22:20,874 --> 00:22:22,440
You have to put on the head gear before going in. 

570
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:23,274
(They're fully ready) 

571
00:22:23,274 --> 00:22:25,607
- Because you might get hurt? / - It must be rough. 

572
00:22:25,607 --> 00:22:27,974
You'll keep rolling inside the ball. 

573
00:22:27,974 --> 00:22:29,640
- So you won't hurt each other? / - Yes. 

574
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:32,374
(The players enter the ball) 

575
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:34,607
This is bigger than I expected. 

576
00:22:34,607 --> 00:22:37,474
(They put on the safety belts) 

577
00:22:37,474 --> 00:22:38,640
Ready. 

578
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:41,040
- Put it on as soon as we start. / - Okay. 

579
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:42,740
Put it on as soon as we start rolling. 

580
00:22:52,807 --> 00:22:54,707
Hold on! Wait! 

581
00:22:58,674 --> 00:22:59,874
Hold on! Wait! 

582
00:23:05,374 --> 00:23:08,040
(Laughing) 

583
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:10,340
That's just a big squirrel cage. 

584
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:13,440
Yes, it feels like we're in the hamster wheel. 

585
00:23:13,807 --> 00:23:15,074
It looks dizzy. 

586
00:23:15,574 --> 00:23:16,707
Because you keep rolling. 

587
00:23:16,707 --> 00:23:18,274
- If two guys try that out together... / - That course... 

588
00:23:18,274 --> 00:23:20,440
- They would get really close. / - Is only 8 seconds. 

589
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:23,040
- It's a long track. / - Yes, it's very long. 

590
00:23:23,807 --> 00:23:25,007
What is this? Hey! 

591
00:23:25,007 --> 00:23:28,474
(Laughing) 

592
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:31,374
You are laughing there, right? 

593
00:23:31,374 --> 00:23:33,274
It was scarier than I thought. 

594
00:23:33,274 --> 00:23:35,540
- You laughed because it was scary? / - Yes. 

595
00:23:36,474 --> 00:23:38,407
I ate the lipstick. 

596
00:23:39,107 --> 00:23:42,107
(It's hectic inside) 

597
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:43,874
What's wrong with this? 

598
00:23:43,874 --> 00:23:46,374
(Laughing) 

599
00:23:49,707 --> 00:23:51,674
(Let's find out how well they put on the lipstick) 

600
00:23:54,007 --> 00:23:55,040
It hurts. 

601
00:23:55,474 --> 00:23:57,507
(The traces of the lipstick) 

602
00:23:58,374 --> 00:23:59,374
He did it. 

603
00:24:00,474 --> 00:24:02,607
This is bad. I'm in big trouble. 

604
00:24:04,207 --> 00:24:06,140
(Yes, indeed! His face is in big trouble) 

605
00:24:08,374 --> 00:24:09,774
- He's completely ruined. / - He's ruined. 

606
00:24:09,774 --> 00:24:11,607
It looks like he's in a zombie movie. 

607
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:14,107
- It's a zombie movie. / - I tried very hard. 

608
00:24:14,107 --> 00:24:17,207
Look at the camera. I'm completely ruined. 

609
00:24:17,574 --> 00:24:19,340
I want to try that. 

610
00:24:22,574 --> 00:24:25,440
(They check each other's funny faces) 

611
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:26,607
Who won then? 

612
00:24:26,607 --> 00:24:27,707
Come here. Come here. 

613
00:24:28,207 --> 00:24:30,174
Doesn't it look like I won? 

614
00:24:30,274 --> 00:24:32,707
- The lipstick is on his teeth. / - He ate it. 

615
00:24:33,074 --> 00:24:35,174
But you couldn't finish applying it all the way. 

616
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:37,007
- No. / - You have a bit of your lips left. 

617
00:24:37,107 --> 00:24:38,840
- Gosh, this is tricky. / - Baekho did a good job. 

618
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:42,640
But JR applied it all over his lips. 

619
00:24:42,907 --> 00:24:44,174
Hey! What is this? 

620
00:24:44,207 --> 00:24:49,340
(Baekho couldn't apply it as he was too busy laughing) 

621
00:24:50,174 --> 00:24:52,174
(He didn't apply it during the whole ride) 

622
00:24:52,174 --> 00:24:56,640
(When they arrived, he applied it then) 

623
00:24:57,940 --> 00:24:59,274
My gosh, you did that? 

624
00:24:59,274 --> 00:25:01,140
(The feeling of betrayal surges through him) 

625
00:25:02,540 --> 00:25:04,407
- Really? / - Who do you think won? 

626
00:25:04,507 --> 00:25:05,540
Given everything... 

627
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:08,207
- This is a tie. / - Don't I look prettier? 

628
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,740
The cameraman should film only the winner. 

629
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:11,974
Film the winner. 

630
00:25:11,974 --> 00:25:13,340
It's a tie. 

631
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:23,240
You owe me dinner. 

632
00:25:23,574 --> 00:25:25,940
- You cheated. / - No, I didn't. 

633
00:25:26,307 --> 00:25:27,574
I didn't cheat. 

634
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:29,774
Let's go. We have to ride one more. 

635
00:25:29,807 --> 00:25:31,107
- There was one more course. / - Right. 

636
00:25:31,107 --> 00:25:32,174
- At the same facility? / - You should ride one more. 

637
00:25:32,174 --> 00:25:35,807
There's one more. They filled it with water this time. 

638
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:37,540
That must be hard. 

639
00:25:37,540 --> 00:25:40,007
Then, up to how many people can fit in that ball? 

640
00:25:40,007 --> 00:25:42,074
- 4 people can fit in. / - About 3 to 4 people... 

641
00:25:42,074 --> 00:25:43,240
- Can ride that. / - 3 to 4? 

642
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:45,840
If four people get on that, it would be hectic. 

643
00:25:46,174 --> 00:25:48,807
I think this will be scary. We're in big trouble. 

644
00:25:48,807 --> 00:25:49,940
I'll see you in one piece. 

645
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:55,307
(Nervous) 

646
00:25:58,640 --> 00:25:59,640
What happened? 

647
00:26:00,407 --> 00:26:01,174
- You don't have safety belts? / - That looks fun. 

648
00:26:01,174 --> 00:26:03,274
- No safety belts. / - We don't put them on for that. 

649
00:26:03,274 --> 00:26:06,507
- That looks fun. / - This one is really fun. 

650
00:26:06,507 --> 00:26:11,540
(Their bodies don't rotate, they just slide) 

651
00:26:13,907 --> 00:26:15,940
- My gosh! / - It's long too. 

652
00:26:16,274 --> 00:26:18,407
Wait, that won't feel dizzy. 

653
00:26:18,407 --> 00:26:20,940
- It'd feel like a water park ride. / - That's right. 

654
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:22,474
JR... 

655
00:26:26,507 --> 00:26:28,807
JR... 

656
00:26:32,540 --> 00:26:35,240
They bumped their heads. 

657
00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:37,707
JR is being crushed. 

658
00:26:37,707 --> 00:26:38,740
(Splash) 

659
00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:39,774
That was a header. 

660
00:26:43,507 --> 00:26:45,307
Are you sure that this is supposed to be fun? 

661
00:26:45,307 --> 00:26:47,374
- Yes, it was so much fun. / - It was fun. 

662
00:26:47,374 --> 00:26:49,440
- Is that supposed to be fun? / - So much fun. 

663
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:52,607
(They're washing off their lipstick as they roll down) 

664
00:26:55,574 --> 00:26:58,174
(1 minute which felt like 1 hour passes by) 

665
00:26:59,174 --> 00:27:02,607
(Floundering) 

666
00:27:06,907 --> 00:27:08,540
- It's a fun ride, right? / - Yes, it is. 

667
00:27:08,540 --> 00:27:10,340
To us, it looks like a penalty. 

668
00:27:10,340 --> 00:27:11,507
No, it's not. 

669
00:27:11,674 --> 00:27:13,140
You look exhausted. 

670
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:15,107
They can't walk after getting out. 

671
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:22,940
(The beastly sexy guy) 

672
00:27:27,074 --> 00:27:29,274
- I think you look a bit annoyed. / - No. I'm not. 

673
00:27:29,274 --> 00:27:31,107
It would be funny if they fought looking like that. 

674
00:27:33,340 --> 00:27:34,440
I have a runny nose. 

675
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:39,040
(They find this situation ridiculous) 

676
00:27:40,607 --> 00:27:42,174
- This is certainly... / - Yes? 

677
00:27:42,474 --> 00:27:43,740
It is exciting. 

678
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:46,607
Liar! 

679
00:27:47,007 --> 00:27:48,307
- Which one will you choose? / - That's expensive. 

680
00:27:48,307 --> 00:27:50,207
- I'll ride the one with water. / - The one with water. 

681
00:27:50,207 --> 00:27:53,340
But here's my tip. You must bring swimming goggles. 

682
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:54,974
- I agree. / - Because you can't open your eyes? 

683
00:27:54,974 --> 00:27:57,240
- Right. You need them. / - You can't enjoy the ride. 

684
00:27:57,507 --> 00:27:59,074
- Where are we going next? / - They're exhausted. 

685
00:27:59,074 --> 00:28:01,174
Now... Did you have fun? 

686
00:28:01,174 --> 00:28:02,407
Since we had fun, 

687
00:28:02,407 --> 00:28:05,174
we should enjoy the atmosphere of the night. 

688
00:28:05,174 --> 00:28:07,140
- As we enjoy that, will we... / - We'll eat again. 

689
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:09,240
We'll eat again? Let's go then. 

690
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:09,774
Let's go. 

691
00:28:10,707 --> 00:28:12,174
- It's perfect now. / - Alright. 

692
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:14,307
I'm hungry again. 

693
00:28:15,107 --> 00:28:15,807
Let's go. 

694
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:18,474
- You should get that. / - Let's go. 

695
00:28:18,474 --> 00:28:20,574
- It was fun. / - Yes, it was fun. 

696
00:28:20,574 --> 00:28:21,274
Great. 

697
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:24,640
(It's time for JR to evaluate again) 

698
00:28:25,274 --> 00:28:26,674
He's doing it again. 

699
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:30,374
You should have at least removed the lipstick. 

700
00:28:30,374 --> 00:28:31,774
At first, I was scared. 

701
00:28:31,774 --> 00:28:34,540
Now that I've tried it once, I want to do it again. 

702
00:28:34,540 --> 00:28:36,107
It's addictive. 

703
00:28:36,307 --> 00:28:42,307
As for the rating, I will give it 4.2. 

704
00:28:42,307 --> 00:28:42,940
(The activity gets 4.2 out of 5) 

705
00:28:42,940 --> 00:28:45,774
I deducted 0.8 because I lost. 

706
00:28:46,174 --> 00:28:47,474
(From the activity facility to the night market) 

707
00:28:47,474 --> 00:28:49,340
I can't wait to check out the night market. 

708
00:28:49,340 --> 00:28:50,807
- The night market was great. / - I didn't know about it. 

709
00:28:50,807 --> 00:28:51,740
Was it always there? 

710
00:28:51,740 --> 00:28:53,807
- It's new. / - When you go on trips... 

711
00:28:54,174 --> 00:28:56,974
When you travel abroad, there are night markets. 

712
00:28:56,974 --> 00:28:58,640
At first, it was the place where 

713
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:00,407
you went for a walk in the forest. 

714
00:29:00,407 --> 00:29:02,674
But now, there are food trucks too. 

715
00:29:02,907 --> 00:29:05,174
It's like a night market now. 

716
00:29:06,707 --> 00:29:08,307
It's only until the end of December. 

717
00:29:08,307 --> 00:29:10,240
- Because it gets cold at night. / - This is... 

718
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:13,140
- The night market. / - Until December. 

719
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:14,507
Usually, in Jeju-do... 

720
00:29:15,207 --> 00:29:17,640
It becomes quiet at night. 

721
00:29:17,907 --> 00:29:20,407
But this place gets bright at night. 

722
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:23,107
- I want to go. / - This is the hot place. 

723
00:29:23,107 --> 00:29:25,607
I didn't know Jeju-do had a place like this. 

724
00:29:26,107 --> 00:29:28,640
(It's the newly emerging hot place in Jeju-do) 

725
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:32,440
(A night market in an arboretum) 

726
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:35,340
It's a night market in an arboretum. 

727
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:36,874
- There's fresh air. / - Yes. 

728
00:29:37,707 --> 00:29:40,440
There are foods from all over the place. 

729
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:42,340
Usually, night markets are in the city 

730
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:43,540
where the air isn't clean. 

731
00:29:43,540 --> 00:29:44,374
Right. 

732
00:29:44,374 --> 00:29:45,807
But here, it's so clean. 

733
00:29:48,140 --> 00:29:49,540
- Let's go. / - Let's go in. 

734
00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:50,674
We brought a mat too. 

735
00:29:50,674 --> 00:29:52,907
- We'll buy food. / - Yes. 

736
00:29:52,907 --> 00:29:54,674
- Then we'll eat on the mat. / - Right. 

737
00:29:54,674 --> 00:29:57,007
- As if we're on a picnic. / - That's right. 

738
00:29:57,007 --> 00:29:58,607
By the way, thanks for the food, JR. 

739
00:30:00,207 --> 00:30:01,474
Am I buying? 

740
00:30:01,474 --> 00:30:03,574
I'll just give you my wallet. 

741
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:05,574
Great. Can I buy everything with this? 

742
00:30:05,574 --> 00:30:06,940
- Sure. Go ahead. / - Nice. 

743
00:30:06,940 --> 00:30:08,807
- I got enough cash. / - Let's go. 

744
00:30:08,807 --> 00:30:10,474
- Enjoy. / - Let's go. 

745
00:30:10,774 --> 00:30:11,874
Enjoy the food. 

746
00:30:12,740 --> 00:30:14,340
Let's look around. Here. 

747
00:30:15,007 --> 00:30:16,540
This is it. 

748
00:30:17,007 --> 00:30:19,740
Here. Sook is here. 

749
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:22,407
- She's here. / - Yes. 

750
00:30:22,407 --> 00:30:23,607
Her picture is there. 

751
00:30:23,607 --> 00:30:25,907
- I ate there on Battle Trip. / - Yes. 

752
00:30:25,907 --> 00:30:27,274
It's starting again today. 

753
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:30,574
I'm lucky. 

754
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:34,340
I remember that food truck. The cube steak place. 

755
00:30:34,340 --> 00:30:35,940
(For Battle Trip's 1-year anniversary) 

756
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:40,074
(Sook ate their cube steak in Jeju-do) 

757
00:30:40,074 --> 00:30:42,574
- She's here. / - Yes, she is. 

758
00:30:43,307 --> 00:30:45,440
- Hello. / - Hello. 

759
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:46,874
We're from Battle Trip too. 

760
00:30:46,874 --> 00:30:48,374

761
00:30:48,374 --> 00:30:51,474
- Thank you to Sook. / - Of course, we will. 

762
00:30:51,974 --> 00:30:53,374
- He said that. / - Why? 

763
00:30:53,374 --> 00:30:55,107
Thanks to her, 

764
00:30:55,107 --> 00:30:56,707
we got a lease. 

765
00:30:56,707 --> 00:30:58,474
(No more rentals) 

766
00:30:59,307 --> 00:31:01,640
(Everyone is cheering for him) 

767
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:03,774
That's really great. 

768
00:31:04,274 --> 00:31:06,674
- Let's try the steak. / - Of course. 

769
00:31:06,674 --> 00:31:09,007
If you order this, 

770
00:31:09,007 --> 00:31:10,674
we'll make it really delicious. 

771
00:31:10,674 --> 00:31:12,107
- Okay, we'll order that. / - Okay. 

772
00:31:12,274 --> 00:31:13,507

What do you think? Is this okay? 

783
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:35,907
$16 from the start? 

784
00:31:35,907 --> 00:31:37,674
($16 from the start?) 

785
00:31:38,207 --> 00:31:41,274
Don't you guys drink? Did you just have food? 

786
00:31:41,274 --> 00:31:42,907
I don't like to drink. 

787
00:31:43,007 --> 00:31:44,307

You should dip this roll in the soup. 

862
00:34:26,274 --> 00:34:27,407
You're right. 

863
00:34:27,407 --> 00:34:28,407
(The roll tastes good with the soup) 

864
00:34:34,874 --> 00:34:39,007
- The one that had the longest line. / - Yes. 

865
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:42,040
Turkey. 

866
00:34:42,474 --> 00:34:43,440
Let's eat this. 

867
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:46,274
- Yes, try that. / - Mustard sauce costs 10 cents. 

868
00:34:46,274 --> 00:34:47,474
You can grab it like this. 

869
00:34:47,707 --> 00:34:48,974
It looks like a sausage. 

870
00:34:48,974 --> 00:34:50,440
(Adding a lot of sauce) 

871
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:52,607
Can you put it in your mouth? Try the other side. 

872
00:34:53,307 --> 00:34:56,707
(You should take a big bite of it) 

873
00:34:56,707 --> 00:34:57,774
I want it too. 

874
00:34:58,540 --> 00:35:00,607
That looks so delicious. 

875
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:01,740
It's good for taking photos. 

876
00:35:02,274 --> 00:35:03,840
You look good with it. 

877
00:35:05,407 --> 00:35:07,940
- It's fried. / - It doesn't taste greasy. 

878
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:09,674
It tastes like smoked meat. 

879
00:35:09,674 --> 00:35:12,840
- Isn't the meat tough? / - No, it's tender. 

880
00:35:13,207 --> 00:35:15,374
Good thing we got three sauces. 

881
00:35:15,374 --> 00:35:17,340
You should buy three sauce packets. 

882
00:35:17,340 --> 00:35:18,540
One isn't enough. 

883
00:35:21,207 --> 00:35:23,207
(They fell in love with the turkey leg) 

884
00:35:23,207 --> 00:35:24,374
Goodness. 

885
00:35:24,974 --> 00:35:26,140
That looks good. 

886
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:29,940
You should've taken a picture. Didn't you take any? 

887
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:31,607
We don't take pictures when we eat. 

888
00:35:31,607 --> 00:35:33,574
We should've done that. 

889
00:35:33,574 --> 00:35:35,340
JR, you look very manly 

890
00:35:35,340 --> 00:35:36,940
when your eyebrows are showing. 

891
00:35:37,740 --> 00:35:38,807
Thank you. 

892
00:35:39,107 --> 00:35:42,340
(JR devours the turkey leg) 

893
00:35:43,374 --> 00:35:48,674
(Then he takes a sip of beer) 

894
00:35:51,407 --> 00:35:53,640
- Banh xeo. / - Have you tried it before? 

895
00:35:54,140 --> 00:35:55,107
Is it your first time? 

896
00:35:55,107 --> 00:35:56,540
- It is. / - It was so good. 

897
00:35:56,540 --> 00:35:57,040
I'm hungry. 

898
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:59,107
- I see. Banh xeo isn't shrimp. / - Right. 

899
00:36:00,340 --> 00:36:01,707
I thought it was shrimp. 

900
00:36:02,140 --> 00:36:04,007
- I had it for the first time. / - It's good, isn't it? 

901
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:06,607
It was so good with the lettuce. 

902
00:36:07,874 --> 00:36:09,107
That's banh xeo. 

903
00:36:09,107 --> 00:36:11,774
(JR eats banh xeo for the first time) 

904
00:36:11,774 --> 00:36:13,340
Goodness. 

905
00:36:14,274 --> 00:36:15,407
How is it? 

906
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:18,607
- Is that good? / - Fried food... 

907
00:36:18,607 --> 00:36:20,707
Tastes awesome with lettuce as a wrap. 

908
00:36:20,707 --> 00:36:21,774
You're right. 

909
00:36:21,774 --> 00:36:25,007
(Baekho takes a bite of banh xeo too) 

910
00:36:25,007 --> 00:36:26,174
He eats it so deliciously. 

911
00:36:28,607 --> 00:36:30,140
It's super tasty. 

912
00:36:31,340 --> 00:36:32,774
This is really good. 

913
00:36:33,574 --> 00:36:35,074
I've tried it a few times before. 

914
00:36:35,707 --> 00:36:37,074
This is very good. 

915
00:36:39,807 --> 00:36:42,207
I've never seen JR 

916
00:36:42,207 --> 00:36:44,140
eat this much before. 

917
00:36:44,140 --> 00:36:46,274
- Me neither. / - Right? 

918
00:36:46,274 --> 00:36:47,774
That means it's really delicious. 

919
00:36:47,774 --> 00:36:50,340
- Usually, I don't eat a lot. / - Right. 

920
00:36:50,340 --> 00:36:51,907
But that was so good. 

921
00:36:52,807 --> 00:36:53,940
You're really eating a lot. 

922
00:36:53,940 --> 00:36:55,474
I forgot that I was full and I kept eating. 

923
00:36:56,774 --> 00:36:57,840
This would... 

924
00:36:58,307 --> 00:36:59,840
Make a perfect family trip. 

925
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:02,640
Mom and dad can have a drink, 

926
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:04,507
and the kids can have food. 

927
00:37:04,874 --> 00:37:06,174
It'd be perfect. 

928
00:37:07,474 --> 00:37:13,540
(A perfect ending to the first day of their trip) 

929
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:22,074
(Baekho Tour enjoys the final meal of the first day) 

930
00:37:30,074 --> 00:37:32,340
(Refreshing beer with the cool breeze of Jeju-do) 

931
00:37:32,340 --> 00:37:33,974
That looks like a beer commercial. 

932
00:37:35,107 --> 00:37:37,640
(Baekho drinks refreshing cola) 

933
00:37:38,407 --> 00:37:42,007
We're done eating, so are we going to the lodging? 

934
00:37:42,007 --> 00:37:43,074
Yes. 

935
00:37:43,074 --> 00:37:44,174
But... 

936
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:46,907
It's a bit far. 

937
00:37:46,907 --> 00:37:47,340
What? 

938
00:37:48,474 --> 00:37:49,940
- Our lodging was a bit far. / - Really? 

939
00:37:49,940 --> 00:37:51,340
- Do we have to go somewhere else? / - Shall we go? 

940
00:37:51,340 --> 00:37:52,340
Yes. 

941
00:37:52,607 --> 00:37:54,007
Tomorrow, we have to... 

942
00:37:54,507 --> 00:37:55,674
Tour the east side. 

943
00:37:55,674 --> 00:37:58,074
- Because we looked at the west. / - Yes. 

944
00:37:58,474 --> 00:38:00,607
Now we'll go to the east side and sleep there. 

945
00:38:01,174 --> 00:38:02,207
- Let's go. / - Okay. 

946
00:38:02,207 --> 00:38:03,974
Our lodging is on the other side. 

947
00:38:03,974 --> 00:38:09,874
(Hoping tomorrow will be as fun as today) 

948
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:13,707
I know all about the west... 

949
00:38:13,707 --> 00:38:15,707
- You were researching hard. / - Yes. 

950
00:38:15,707 --> 00:38:18,507
- So you studied the east side. / - This place is great. 

951
00:38:18,507 --> 00:38:20,707
Wow, it's beautiful inside. 

952
00:38:20,707 --> 00:38:21,840
It's my first time on this side. 

953
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:23,207
- Me too. / - It's a trip. 

954
00:38:23,207 --> 00:38:24,207
It excites me. 

955
00:38:24,207 --> 00:38:25,207
It's so beautiful. 

956
00:38:25,874 --> 00:38:27,940
- You said you liked dol hareubang. / - Yes. 

957
00:38:27,940 --> 00:38:29,307
So we're going to visit a stone maze. 

958
00:38:29,307 --> 00:38:31,874
- Baekho, do you hear me? / - It's so pretty. 

959
00:38:31,874 --> 00:38:34,340
Baekho isn't familiar with that neighborhood. 

960
00:38:34,340 --> 00:38:35,640
This is amazing. 

961
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:36,507
It's my first time having this. 

962
00:38:36,507 --> 00:38:38,707
- That was so good. / - This is good. 

963
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:40,374
What's that? 

964
00:38:40,374 --> 00:38:42,340
- That was awesome. / - That was great. 

965
00:38:42,340 --> 00:38:43,474
- That was the highlight. / - True. 

966
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:47,707
(One bite after another) 

967
00:38:47,707 --> 00:38:49,574
(Empty bowls are getting piled up) 

968
00:38:50,974 --> 00:38:53,107
JR, what have you done? 

969
00:38:54,174 --> 00:38:56,240
(Continuously being deeply touched) 

970
00:38:57,774 --> 00:39:01,840
(Day 2 of Baekho Tour begins now) 

971
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:05,774
- Baekho Tour. / - Baekho Tour. 

972
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:09,507
(Baekho Tour Day 2) 

973
00:39:09,507 --> 00:39:11,440
- Green tangerine soba sounds delicious. / - It does. 

974
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:12,774
Green tangerine soba was good. 

975
00:39:12,774 --> 00:39:15,140
- It must be refreshing. / - The houses are so nice. 

976
00:39:15,140 --> 00:39:17,640
- Did you sleep there? / - It was a separate house. 

977
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:20,307
(Entire house, $160 per night) 

978
00:39:26,574 --> 00:39:29,774
(The trip planner gets up) 

979
00:39:29,774 --> 00:39:31,207
Did they fight the night before? 

980
00:39:34,407 --> 00:39:36,607
Wait, he doesn't look that cute. 

981
00:39:36,607 --> 00:39:37,807
- He's cute... / - He looks like a Mexican. 

982
00:39:37,807 --> 00:39:39,874
But his beard has grown a lot. 

983
00:39:43,507 --> 00:39:47,340
(Half asleep) 

984
00:39:48,074 --> 00:39:50,707
(I should wake up JR) 

985
00:39:53,907 --> 00:39:56,940
(JR) 

986
00:39:57,474 --> 00:40:00,974
(JR doesn't seem to want to wake up) 

987
00:40:01,474 --> 00:40:03,040
When you go on a trip for TV show 

988
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:04,407
while having a busy schedule... 

989
00:40:04,407 --> 00:40:06,540
- You get a really good rest. / - That's true. 

990
00:40:06,740 --> 00:40:08,307
You get to eat delicious food. 

991
00:40:08,674 --> 00:40:10,874
- We slept a few more minutes. / - Did you fall asleep? 

992
00:40:10,874 --> 00:40:12,374
You're sleeping like that? 

993
00:40:13,374 --> 00:40:16,974
(30 minutes later) 

994
00:40:19,207 --> 00:40:20,440
Let's get it. 

995
00:40:23,007 --> 00:40:24,040
It's definitely... 

996
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:25,907
- He shaved. / - I didn't see this yesterday. 

997
00:40:26,540 --> 00:40:28,574
- This looks totally different now. / - Right? 

998
00:40:28,574 --> 00:40:30,674
This house has all the features of a Jeju-do house. 

999
00:40:31,174 --> 00:40:33,140
There's the stone wall. 

1000
00:40:33,507 --> 00:40:35,040
And there's no gate. 

1001
00:40:35,474 --> 00:40:37,207
Yeah, it's interesting that there's no gate. 

1002
00:40:37,207 --> 00:40:38,207
We don't have gates here. 

1003
00:40:38,574 --> 00:40:39,974
How pretty. 

1004
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:42,574
- It's so pretty. / - They kept traits of Jeju-do houses. 

1005
00:40:42,574 --> 00:40:44,474
And built new houses there. 

1006
00:40:44,474 --> 00:40:45,940
Even the roof is low. 

1007
00:40:47,307 --> 00:40:49,907
- See? / - Don't houses have low roofs... 

1008
00:40:49,907 --> 00:40:52,007
- Because of the wind? / - That's right. 

1009
00:40:52,007 --> 00:40:52,740
That's right. 

1010
00:40:52,740 --> 00:40:54,740
I felt it when we arrived yesterday. 

1011
00:40:54,740 --> 00:40:56,140
The wind of Jeju-do. 

1012
00:40:57,840 --> 00:40:58,874
(What's their first itinerary on Day 2?) 

1013
00:40:58,874 --> 00:41:01,207
What's the first itinerary today? 

1014
00:41:01,207 --> 00:41:02,474
We must have breakfast. 

1015
00:41:02,474 --> 00:41:03,807
(It's breakfast) 

1016
00:41:03,807 --> 00:41:04,874
Aren't you hungry? 

1017
00:41:04,974 --> 00:41:06,607
We ate a lot yesterday. 

1018
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:09,640
- But I got hungry after I woke up. / - Right. 

1019
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:11,007
We must keep eating. 

1020
00:41:11,007 --> 00:41:13,307
Did someone beat you up in the face? 

1021
00:41:14,274 --> 00:41:15,507
No, I ate a lot the day before. 

1022
00:41:15,507 --> 00:41:17,207
- He ate a lot. / - That's why, right? 

1023
00:41:17,207 --> 00:41:18,940
I thought someone hit you last night. 

1024
00:41:18,940 --> 00:41:19,707
(He just got puffy from eating a lot) 

1025
00:41:20,740 --> 00:41:25,907
(12 minutes to the soba restaurant from the lodging) 

1026
00:41:26,507 --> 00:41:28,740
You'll definitely like it. 

1027
00:41:28,740 --> 00:41:31,274
(Day 2 of Baekho Tour begins) 

1028
00:41:32,874 --> 00:41:35,640
Overall, it is quiet and peaceful around here. 

1029
00:41:36,207 --> 00:41:37,407
It's so nice here. 

1030
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:39,540
"Doreumeong." 

1031
00:41:39,907 --> 00:41:41,074
"Doreumeong." 

1032
00:41:41,340 --> 00:41:44,507
(He spots a sign while driving) 

1033
00:41:45,374 --> 00:41:47,240
- Is that a dol hareubang? / - No, "doreumeong." 

1034
00:41:47,540 --> 00:41:49,974
"Doreuda" means "to run." 

1035
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:51,974
- To run. / - Then what does "doreumeong" mean? 

1036
00:41:51,974 --> 00:41:52,907
"While running." 

1037
00:41:52,907 --> 00:41:55,540
"Meong" comes at the end of a verb 

1038
00:41:55,540 --> 00:41:56,640
to use the progressive tense. 

1039
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:58,574
- That's why our tour name was like that. / - Right. 

1040
00:41:58,574 --> 00:42:00,440
- While playing, while resting. / - We did that. 

1041
00:42:01,474 --> 00:42:03,907
With Jeju-do dialect, the sentences end abruptly. 

1042
00:42:04,074 --> 00:42:06,340
It's similar to the American accent. 

1043
00:42:06,774 --> 00:42:08,340
It ends with "man." 

1044
00:42:08,340 --> 00:42:10,040
A lot of sentences end with "man." 

1045
00:42:10,540 --> 00:42:12,574
- Like "What's up, man?" / - Yes, something like that. 

1046
00:42:12,807 --> 00:42:14,007
That's right. 

1047
00:42:14,340 --> 00:42:16,140
I didn't know "What's up, man?" was from Jeju-do. 

1048
00:42:17,607 --> 00:42:19,407
It's a welcoming greeting. 

1049
00:42:19,407 --> 00:42:21,174
- "What's up, man?" / - That's right. 

1050
00:42:22,307 --> 00:42:24,107
(They travel while talking about the Jeju-do dialect) 

1051
00:42:24,107 --> 00:42:26,874
We're going to eat some delicious food again. 

1052
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:28,674
We're here. 

1053
00:42:28,874 --> 00:42:30,474
We'll see it once we turn. 

1054
00:42:32,774 --> 00:42:34,107
- Isn't that it? / - Right here... 

1055
00:42:34,107 --> 00:42:35,607
- Is... Is that it? / - Isn't that it? 

1056
00:42:35,607 --> 00:42:38,040
- Right here... Is... Is that it? / - Isn't that it? 

1057
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:39,040
All the houses look European. 

1058
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:41,140
- Yes, it's the soba restaurant. / - Like Europe. 

1059
00:42:41,140 --> 00:42:41,840
Is that the place? 

1060
00:42:42,707 --> 00:42:45,407
(Green tangerine soba) 

1061
00:42:45,407 --> 00:42:46,507
You're right. 

1062
00:42:46,774 --> 00:42:48,240
(Baekho researched a lot about the east of Jeju-do) 

1063
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:50,074
I wonder what JR will like. 

1064
00:42:51,107 --> 00:42:54,974
(Researching diligently) 

1065
00:42:55,507 --> 00:42:57,607
Green tangerine soba? 

1066
00:42:59,274 --> 00:43:00,774
This is it. 

1067
00:43:01,540 --> 00:43:03,407
- That looks delicious. / - Green tangerine soba. 

1068
00:43:03,407 --> 00:43:05,507
- That's... / - That looks good. 

1069
00:43:06,607 --> 00:43:08,640
Green tangerines are refreshing. 

1070
00:43:08,774 --> 00:43:10,940
(Battle Trip Part 2 will be aired soon) 

1071
00:43:10,940 --> 00:43:12,658
Yes, this is the green tangerine soba restaurant. 

1072
00:43:12,658 --> 00:43:13,925
Is this the place? 

1073
00:43:15,325 --> 00:43:17,658
- Yes, it is. / - Is that a new restaurant too? 

1074
00:43:17,658 --> 00:43:19,991
Yes, this place is fairly new too. 

1075
00:43:22,125 --> 00:43:25,125
The interior design was cute and pretty. 

1076
00:43:28,658 --> 00:43:30,525
(Welcome) 

1077
00:43:31,425 --> 00:43:34,725
(How will the green tangerine soba taste?) 

1078
00:43:35,725 --> 00:43:37,358
Green tangerines are... 

1079
00:43:37,358 --> 00:43:38,458
Tangerines that are green. 

1080
00:43:39,491 --> 00:43:40,625
You know it well. 

1081
00:43:40,625 --> 00:43:42,425
(This is a piece of cake) 

1082
00:43:42,725 --> 00:43:45,291
Green tangerines are in season right now. 

1083
00:43:45,791 --> 00:43:47,858
- Really? They're in season now? / - Yes, they are. 

1084
00:43:47,858 --> 00:43:49,758
They are delicious even when you eat them raw. 

1085
00:43:51,625 --> 00:43:53,591
- They look like calamansi. / - How pretty. 

1086
00:43:53,958 --> 00:43:57,025
They weren't that sour. 

1087
00:43:58,558 --> 00:44:00,591
I'm curious about how it will taste. 

1088
00:44:01,591 --> 00:44:03,858
- Here's your appetizer. / - Thank you. 

1089
00:44:03,858 --> 00:44:05,391
- This must be the soba roll. / - Is this the dish? 

1090
00:44:05,391 --> 00:44:06,558
This is the soba roll. 

1091
00:44:06,558 --> 00:44:08,425
(Soba roll?) 

1092
00:44:08,858 --> 00:44:11,091
- They rolled soba like rice roll. / - Looks delicious. 

1093
00:44:12,158 --> 00:44:14,458
A long time ago, that dish was popular. 

1094
00:44:16,158 --> 00:44:17,291
This fried tofu looks like a pot. 

1095
00:44:17,291 --> 00:44:18,958
They added hijiki in there. 

1096
00:44:18,958 --> 00:44:19,925
(Fried tofu stuffed with rice and hijiki, $8) 

1097
00:44:21,125 --> 00:44:26,958
(Soba noodles rolled up like rice rolls) 

1098
00:44:27,725 --> 00:44:30,625
It doesn't have many calories. 

1099
00:44:30,625 --> 00:44:32,625
- That looks delicious. / - It's less fattening than rice. 

1100
00:44:32,625 --> 00:44:33,758
It's less fattening, 

1101
00:44:33,758 --> 00:44:34,891
it doesn't mean you won't gain weight. 

1102
00:44:35,558 --> 00:44:36,858
If you eat a lot, you'll gain weight. 

1103
00:44:39,525 --> 00:44:40,525
The sauce was really good. 

1104
00:44:40,525 --> 00:44:43,791
- The owner made that tsuyu himself. / - It looks good. 

1105
00:44:44,558 --> 00:44:46,291
We should generously dip the sauce for this. 

1106
00:44:46,291 --> 00:44:48,058
(He has a piece of the soba roll first) 

1107
00:44:52,191 --> 00:44:53,358
It's good. 

1108
00:44:53,358 --> 00:44:54,858
That looks so good. 

1109
00:44:56,158 --> 00:44:58,491
(Feeling happy) 

1110
00:44:58,491 --> 00:44:59,725
It's good. 

1111
00:45:01,125 --> 00:45:02,791
The soba roll was really delicious. 

1112
00:45:02,791 --> 00:45:03,991
The texture was interesting too. 

1113
00:45:03,991 --> 00:45:05,858
- Normally, you order... / - It does look good. 

1114
00:45:05,858 --> 00:45:07,625
Soba noodles to dip in the sauce. 

1115
00:45:07,625 --> 00:45:10,158
- It tastes just like that. / - Yes, it's a bit similar. 

1116
00:45:11,891 --> 00:45:14,191
(How will the fried tofu stuffed with rice and hijiki taste?) 

1117
00:45:14,191 --> 00:45:15,158
(Hijiki is on top of the rice) 

1118
00:45:15,158 --> 00:45:17,225
- You must eat it in one bite. / - Hijiki is really good. 

1119
00:45:17,225 --> 00:45:18,791
- Some people add it in the rice too, right? / - Yes. 

1120
00:45:18,791 --> 00:45:21,191
- In fritters and soup too. / - It's good for you. 

1121
00:45:22,158 --> 00:45:24,958
(A big bite) 

1122
00:45:28,091 --> 00:45:31,458
(Baekho has a big bite too) 

1123
00:45:36,325 --> 00:45:37,725
I can smell the tangerine. 

1124
00:45:38,291 --> 00:45:39,491
You can smell the tangerine? 

1125
00:45:40,125 --> 00:45:42,658
- Don't you smell the tangerine? / - No, I don't. 

1126
00:45:42,991 --> 00:45:44,025
Try it again. 

1127
00:45:45,158 --> 00:45:46,625
It's because you didn't eat this. 

1128
00:45:47,425 --> 00:45:48,925
(The smell of tangerine comes from the yuzu sauce) 

1129
00:45:48,925 --> 00:45:50,591
The green sauce was on top of the rice. 

1130
00:45:50,591 --> 00:45:52,425
That was like yuzu sauce. 

1131
00:45:52,758 --> 00:45:54,491
- The yuzu sauce. / - I see. 

1132
00:45:54,891 --> 00:45:57,058
- He dropped it. / - I didn't know I dropped it. 

1133
00:45:58,258 --> 00:45:59,891
- This is the tangerine sauce. / - Is this it? 

1134
00:46:00,825 --> 00:46:03,025
- You two look so close. / - You're right. 

1135
00:46:03,025 --> 00:46:04,291
(Eureka!) 

1136
00:46:06,391 --> 00:46:11,158
(He eats everything in one go with the sauce too) 

1137
00:46:13,125 --> 00:46:15,091
You have to eat it all in one bite. 

1138
00:46:15,091 --> 00:46:18,058
That's how you can taste the real flavor of the dish. 

1139
00:46:18,058 --> 00:46:19,491
(Hijiki goes well with the refreshing yuzu sauce) 

1140
00:46:20,825 --> 00:46:24,058
(Fried tofu stuffed with rice is a hearty breakfast) 

1141
00:46:24,058 --> 00:46:26,291
- It's not spicy? / - No, it's not spicy at all. 

1142
00:46:26,725 --> 00:46:27,891
I really want to try that. 

1143
00:46:34,725 --> 00:46:36,125
This is really good. 

1144
00:46:38,958 --> 00:46:40,225
Give us our second round of food. 

1145
00:46:42,425 --> 00:46:44,691
- Where should I put this? / - You can put it there. 

1146
00:46:46,291 --> 00:46:48,258
Right, we came here to have this. 

1147
00:46:48,258 --> 00:46:49,391
(The green tangerine soba, $9) 

1148
00:46:50,091 --> 00:46:52,258
- That's the green tangerine soba. / - In soba? 

1149
00:46:52,258 --> 00:46:53,991
- That has to be good. / - That must be delicious. 

1150
00:46:53,991 --> 00:46:55,391
I don't know how they'll taste together. 

1151
00:46:55,391 --> 00:46:57,158
With soba, sauce is the most important. 

1152
00:46:57,158 --> 00:46:57,825
That's right. 

1153
00:46:57,825 --> 00:46:59,825
The owner cooked it really well. 

1154
00:47:01,291 --> 00:47:02,991
- On top of the noodles... / - On top of the noodles... 

1155
00:47:03,491 --> 00:47:05,591
- I'll put this slice. / - Put the slice on top. 

1156
00:47:05,591 --> 00:47:09,258
(Have a spoonful with a slice of green tangerine) 

1157
00:47:09,958 --> 00:47:11,391
- That looks delicious. / - Yes. 

1158
00:47:11,391 --> 00:47:13,158
Cheers, to the green tangerine. 

1159
00:47:20,991 --> 00:47:22,858
The same yuzu scent from 

1160
00:47:22,858 --> 00:47:24,025
the fried tofu stuffed with rice. 

1161
00:47:24,025 --> 00:47:25,258
(On another level from the yuzu sauce) 

1162
00:47:25,258 --> 00:47:28,225
The tangerines are way more aromatic here. 

1163
00:47:28,225 --> 00:47:29,825
They made the dish so appetizing. 

1164
00:47:29,825 --> 00:47:32,091
I think it would go really well with some fried food. 

1165
00:47:32,091 --> 00:47:33,391
They do serve fried food. They have fried shrimp. 

1166
00:47:33,391 --> 00:47:35,991
- Right? You need fried shrimp. / - They do. 

1167
00:47:35,991 --> 00:47:38,625
- Eating it like that... / - You need something fried. 

1168
00:47:38,625 --> 00:47:39,825
It'd be too sweet and sour. 

1169
00:47:40,891 --> 00:47:42,391
Once I put it in my mouth, 

1170
00:47:42,391 --> 00:47:44,158
the citrus flavor fills my mouth. 

1171
00:47:44,958 --> 00:47:46,358
I love tangerines. 

1172
00:47:46,358 --> 00:47:48,225
(Trying to describe the taste) 

1173
00:47:48,358 --> 00:47:49,525
You're right. 

1174
00:47:51,691 --> 00:47:52,958
I couldn't think of what to say. 

1175
00:47:52,958 --> 00:47:54,158
I was expecting something so much better. 

1176
00:47:54,658 --> 00:47:56,191
- You have to eat... / - Yes. 

1177
00:47:56,191 --> 00:48:00,125
The noodles and green tangerine together 

1178
00:48:00,125 --> 00:48:01,425
to truly feel its charming flavor. 

1179
00:48:01,425 --> 00:48:04,358
Eating this makes me feel like I'm in Jeju-do. 

1180
00:48:05,458 --> 00:48:07,525
Jeju-do produces a lot of buckwheat. 

1181
00:48:07,525 --> 00:48:08,525
Buckwheat? 

1182
00:48:08,525 --> 00:48:10,458
Jeju-do is the largest buckwheat producer. 

1183
00:48:10,458 --> 00:48:11,958
- Really? / - Yes. 

1184
00:48:11,958 --> 00:48:13,858
It must taste really good then. 

1185
00:48:15,125 --> 00:48:21,058
(They fill themselves up from breakfast) 

1186
00:48:24,725 --> 00:48:28,225
Are we going somewhere fun now? 

1187
00:48:29,225 --> 00:48:31,425
Since we're in Jeju-do, 

1188
00:48:31,425 --> 00:48:32,558
we're finally going to go swim. 

1189
00:48:33,358 --> 00:48:34,525
But the weather is... 

1190
00:48:35,325 --> 00:48:37,391
Let's go and see. 

1191
00:48:38,091 --> 00:48:39,491
Let's at least see the ocean. 

1192
00:48:39,691 --> 00:48:42,258
Yesterday was the first day I swam this year. 

1193
00:48:43,191 --> 00:48:45,225
It's hard to say we were playing in water yesterday. 

1194
00:48:45,225 --> 00:48:47,991
There was enough water for me. 

1195
00:48:49,125 --> 00:48:50,991
Since I can't swim... 

1196
00:48:51,591 --> 00:48:53,925
That was deep enough for me. 

1197
00:48:54,358 --> 00:48:55,425
Let's go and see. 

1198
00:48:55,891 --> 00:48:57,691
There must be fun things to do there as well. 

1199
00:48:57,691 --> 00:48:58,958
Of course. 

1200
00:48:58,958 --> 00:49:01,058
We should ride a banana boat. 

1201
00:49:02,025 --> 00:49:05,091
Have I ever ridden a banana boat? 

1202
00:49:05,291 --> 00:49:06,725
I think the last time we rode it was in Thailand. 

1203
00:49:06,725 --> 00:49:09,658
You're right. I rode a banana boat in Thailand. 

1204
00:49:10,058 --> 00:49:11,158
- And... / - Could you please stop it? 

1205
00:49:11,158 --> 00:49:12,825
What? Banana boat? 

1206
00:49:12,825 --> 00:49:15,958
I was looking forward to riding a banana boat. 

1207
00:49:15,958 --> 00:49:17,458
What if I can't ride it? 

1208
00:49:17,458 --> 00:49:18,558
I didn't know you wanted to ride it so badly. 

1209
00:49:19,458 --> 00:49:21,225
You're really going to ride a banana boat? 

1210
00:49:21,225 --> 00:49:22,858
Yes, we went to a beach. 

1211
00:49:22,858 --> 00:49:24,891
- Hamdeok Beach is famous. / - It's Hamdeok Beach. 

1212
00:49:25,725 --> 00:49:26,725
I used to play there when I was young. 

1213
00:49:26,725 --> 00:49:28,858
I think the weather has become better than earlier. 

1214
00:49:29,791 --> 00:49:32,258
The weather is better than I imagined. 

1215
00:49:32,791 --> 00:49:35,091
- Over here. / - Yeah, it's not bad. 

1216
00:49:35,091 --> 00:49:36,625
I feel like it'll go smoothly from now on. 

1217
00:49:37,291 --> 00:49:39,091
I trust you. 

1218
00:49:39,091 --> 00:49:41,025
- We'll make it. / - As a trip planner... 

1219
00:49:41,025 --> 00:49:43,825
I believe you checked the weather beforehand. 

1220
00:49:43,825 --> 00:49:46,825
We'll make it. Don't worry. 

1221
00:49:48,058 --> 00:49:51,025
(He's worried they might not be able to swim) 

1222
00:49:51,325 --> 00:49:53,991
I see "Hamdeok" on the sign. 

1223
00:49:54,191 --> 00:49:58,658
(They arrive at Hamdeok Beach) 

1224
00:49:59,125 --> 00:50:00,891
(Hamdeok Beach) 

1225
00:50:00,891 --> 00:50:02,391
Hamdeok Beach is very popular these days. 

1226
00:50:02,391 --> 00:50:04,125
There are so many people. 

1227
00:50:04,125 --> 00:50:06,191
- The water is so clear. / - That's right. 

1228
00:50:06,191 --> 00:50:07,191
(The beach is famous for its emerald color) 

1229
00:50:07,191 --> 00:50:10,725
(The water is shallow, perfect to play in) 

1230
00:50:11,958 --> 00:50:13,091
(You can try various water sports here as well) 

1231
00:50:13,091 --> 00:50:16,125
There are many leisure activities here. 

1232
00:50:16,791 --> 00:50:18,958
Many people enjoy leisure activities there. 

1233
00:50:19,158 --> 00:50:20,658
(But) 

1234
00:50:20,658 --> 00:50:21,658
My goodness. 

1235
00:50:22,225 --> 00:50:23,858
This team had bad weather too. 

1236
00:50:23,858 --> 00:50:25,891
(A strong wind welcomes them) 

1237
00:50:26,658 --> 00:50:29,758
(Due to the hazardous sea warning) 

1238
00:50:29,758 --> 00:50:31,191
(The beach is closed) 

1239
00:50:31,691 --> 00:50:33,991
(The beach is closed due to strong wind) 

1240
00:50:33,991 --> 00:50:34,658
It was sunny... 

1241
00:50:34,658 --> 00:50:35,858
- But there was a windstorm. / - That's right. 

1242
00:50:35,858 --> 00:50:37,758
You can't go into the water, right? 

1243
00:50:37,758 --> 00:50:39,991
- What a shame. / - It's too dangerous. 

1244
00:50:39,991 --> 00:50:41,458
Explain this. 

1245
00:50:41,458 --> 00:50:42,825
(Tell me what this is) 

1246
00:50:42,825 --> 00:50:44,991
What about my unicorn boat? 

1247
00:50:44,991 --> 00:50:48,058
(I can't believe this) 

1248
00:50:48,058 --> 00:50:51,258
This can't be true. Let's go ask. 

1249
00:50:52,825 --> 00:50:54,525
Hey, it's obvious. 

1250
00:50:55,958 --> 00:50:57,158
We can't go in, can we? 

1251
00:50:58,458 --> 00:51:00,258
There will be a typhoon today. 

1252
00:51:00,991 --> 00:51:02,825
Oh, no. 

1253
00:51:04,125 --> 00:51:06,191
It's his first trip to Jeju-do. 

1254
00:51:06,191 --> 00:51:07,625
What should we do now? 

1255
00:51:08,525 --> 00:51:10,791
Let me go have a look. 

1256
00:51:11,291 --> 00:51:14,058
It's okay. Everyone makes mistakes. 

1257
00:51:14,058 --> 00:51:16,691
- You can make a mistake sometimes. / - Yes. 

1258
00:51:16,891 --> 00:51:18,825
I'll check other places to go. 

1259
00:51:19,025 --> 00:51:22,625
(Baekho checks out other places to go) 

1260
00:51:22,625 --> 00:51:24,258
He's not going to the RC car place too, is he? 

1261
00:51:24,658 --> 00:51:28,525
(Instead of playing with water, he plays with sand) 

1262
00:51:31,091 --> 00:51:32,091
This looks nice. 

1263
00:51:32,925 --> 00:51:35,558
JR, I found something. 

1264
00:51:35,558 --> 00:51:36,658
What did he find? 

1265
00:51:36,925 --> 00:51:37,958
Did you find something? 

1266
00:51:37,958 --> 00:51:39,025
(What's Baekho's back-up plan?) 

1267
00:51:39,025 --> 00:51:41,391
- I made something. / - This place looks awesome. 

1268
00:51:42,725 --> 00:51:43,791
What is that? 

1269
00:51:44,458 --> 00:51:48,725
This is a maze. 

1270
00:51:49,458 --> 00:51:51,625
- A maze? / - What do you think? 

1271
00:51:51,625 --> 00:51:53,491
- Shall we go? / - Okay, let's go. 

1272
00:51:53,491 --> 00:51:55,825
- Let's go. / - Let's go. 

1273
00:51:56,125 --> 00:51:58,291
We're going to a maze park. 

1274
00:51:58,891 --> 00:52:01,258
- It's really nice there. / - It's what we saw in the video. 

1275
00:52:01,258 --> 00:52:02,258
Yes. 

1276
00:52:02,258 --> 00:52:03,758
- Natural. / - Disaster. 

1277
00:52:03,758 --> 00:52:05,258
- Baekho. / - Tour. 

1278
00:52:05,625 --> 00:52:06,725
I'm sad. 

1279
00:52:08,491 --> 00:52:10,191
(Baekho Tour Day 2) 

1280
00:52:10,191 --> 00:52:12,225
(Maze Land) 

1281
00:52:12,225 --> 00:52:14,525
- Jeju-do is known for three things. / - Yes. 

1282
00:52:14,658 --> 00:52:17,158
Stones, women and winds. 

1283
00:52:17,158 --> 00:52:20,191
This park has mazes in the shape of the three things. 

1284
00:52:21,091 --> 00:52:24,658
Let's have fun there to make up for this. 

1285
00:52:24,658 --> 00:52:26,758
To make up for this, how about doing this? 

1286
00:52:27,525 --> 00:52:29,558
We were supposed to see who holds onto 

1287
00:52:29,558 --> 00:52:31,258
the banana boat longer. 

1288
00:52:31,258 --> 00:52:33,258
Since we can't play that game, 

1289
00:52:33,258 --> 00:52:34,658
let's play another game there. 

1290
00:52:35,225 --> 00:52:36,725
Whoever's faster... 

1291
00:52:36,725 --> 00:52:38,891
It doesn't matter if we run together. 

1292
00:52:38,891 --> 00:52:42,491
- Whoever reaches the exit first... / - Yes. 

1293
00:52:42,758 --> 00:52:45,658
- Becomes the winner. / - Okay. 

1294
00:52:45,658 --> 00:52:46,991
- Okay? / - Are you sure you can beat me? 

1295
00:52:46,991 --> 00:52:48,191
Of course, I am. 

1296
00:52:48,858 --> 00:52:52,025
(Baekho Tour Day 2) 

1297
00:52:52,025 --> 00:52:53,291
It's near Gujwa. 

1298
00:52:53,291 --> 00:52:55,291
There are many interesting things to see 

1299
00:52:55,291 --> 00:52:56,391
other than the maze park. 

1300
00:52:56,391 --> 00:52:59,925
There are parks and sculpture galleries too. 

1301
00:52:59,925 --> 00:53:00,858
It's here. 

1302
00:53:00,858 --> 00:53:03,325
- So, this is the place. / - Yes, it is. 

1303
00:53:03,325 --> 00:53:05,291
(Looking forward to it) 

1304
00:53:05,791 --> 00:53:07,591
(The biggest maze in the world) 

1305
00:53:07,591 --> 00:53:09,191
The biggest maze in the world. 

1306
00:53:11,225 --> 00:53:18,725
(Maze Land consists of three different mazes) 

1307
00:53:18,725 --> 00:53:20,525
It looks like it's in the United Kingdom. 

1308
00:53:20,525 --> 00:53:21,925
This place was really cool. 

1309
00:53:22,825 --> 00:53:27,291
(This new type of theme park exists nowhere else) 

1310
00:53:27,558 --> 00:53:29,991
There are three different kinds of mazes in here. 

1311
00:53:29,991 --> 00:53:32,058
Once you pay $11 for the entrance, 

1312
00:53:32,058 --> 00:53:33,925
you can stay in the maze as long as you want. 

1313
00:53:34,291 --> 00:53:37,525
What if you entered the maze and can't find the exit? 

1314
00:53:37,525 --> 00:53:39,891
Then, just like you did with the convertible, 

1315
00:53:39,891 --> 00:53:40,925
you have to jump over it. 

1316
00:53:42,425 --> 00:53:44,425
Stone maze, woman maze, wind maze. 

1317
00:53:44,691 --> 00:53:46,991
- That's the three symbols... / - Exactly. 

1318
00:53:47,191 --> 00:53:49,791
We'll go to... You said you like dol hareubang. 

1319
00:53:49,791 --> 00:53:51,725
- Yes, I did. / - So we're going to the stone maze. 

1320
00:53:51,725 --> 00:53:55,691
Okay, I'm very excited now. 

1321
00:53:55,691 --> 00:53:56,691
Good. 

1322
00:53:57,625 --> 00:54:00,025
You'll be around 5 minutes later than me. 

1323
00:54:00,025 --> 00:54:02,391
Baekho is an easy match. 

1324
00:54:03,191 --> 00:54:05,758
You and I will start from a different point. 

1325
00:54:05,758 --> 00:54:07,458
I hope they meet in the middle. 

1326
00:54:07,458 --> 00:54:09,125
- Baekho starts from there. / - That's right. 

1327
00:54:09,125 --> 00:54:10,125
I'll put the flag here. 

1328
00:54:11,125 --> 00:54:14,191
Let's put the flag at the starting point. 

1329
00:54:15,491 --> 00:54:18,558
I will quickly go and take your flag. 

1330
00:54:18,558 --> 00:54:19,725
I'll be quick. 

1331
00:54:19,725 --> 00:54:22,291
That's the opposite of the truth. 

1332
00:54:22,291 --> 00:54:23,491
The loser... 

1333
00:54:24,458 --> 00:54:27,625
- Has to do elephant spins. / - 12 times. 

1334
00:54:27,925 --> 00:54:30,791
He will run 30m in... 

1335
00:54:30,791 --> 00:54:33,625
- Let's say 9 seconds. / - 9 seconds. 

1336
00:54:33,858 --> 00:54:35,558
And he has to repeat until he makes it. 

1337
00:54:35,558 --> 00:54:36,558
Alright. 

1338
00:54:36,558 --> 00:54:38,225
It sounds quite cruel. 

1339
00:54:38,225 --> 00:54:39,858
(The penalty is quite cruel) 

1340
00:54:40,591 --> 00:54:44,358
(Baekho's starting point, Baekho's finishing point) 

1341
00:54:44,358 --> 00:54:47,658
(JR's starting point, JR's finishing point) 

1342
00:54:47,825 --> 00:54:50,225
- It looks really hard. / - It looks so difficult. 

1343
00:54:50,225 --> 00:54:53,291
I heard it usually takes about 1 hour to 1.5 hours. 

1344
00:54:53,558 --> 00:54:54,658
- To escape the maze? / - Yes. 

1345
00:54:54,658 --> 00:54:56,358
You'd lose weight. 

1346
00:54:56,358 --> 00:54:59,691
Jun Jin would just jump out of it. 

1347
00:55:00,125 --> 00:55:04,058
3, 2, 1, go! 

1348
00:55:04,058 --> 00:55:06,691
(Start) 

1349
00:55:07,525 --> 00:55:08,525
Let's go. 

1350
00:55:08,525 --> 00:55:09,725
(The two walk into the maze) 

1351
00:55:09,991 --> 00:55:14,325
I'm very good at these things. 

1352
00:55:14,325 --> 00:55:15,758
I heard this should take one hour. 

1353
00:55:15,758 --> 00:55:20,391
But I'll finish it in 30 minutes. 

1354
00:55:20,591 --> 00:55:22,691
It can be a good workout. 

1355
00:55:22,691 --> 00:55:23,925
It'd be exhausting. 

1356
00:55:23,925 --> 00:55:26,025
(JR keeps walking without hesitation) 

1357
00:55:26,025 --> 00:55:27,125
I can do it easily. 

1358
00:55:28,225 --> 00:55:30,191
(Relaxed) 

1359
00:55:30,691 --> 00:55:32,025
How do I know which way it is? 

1360
00:55:32,025 --> 00:55:33,658
All I can see is the front. 

1361
00:55:35,325 --> 00:55:38,691
(Baekho is already lost) 

1362
00:55:38,691 --> 00:55:39,791
It should be this way. 

1363
00:55:40,125 --> 00:55:42,591
Once you're in it, you'd lose all sense of direction. 

1364
00:55:42,858 --> 00:55:44,425
- You do. / - You lose it. 

1365
00:55:44,425 --> 00:55:47,691
(He keeps jumping) 

1366
00:55:48,991 --> 00:55:49,991
It must be exhausting. 

1367
00:55:49,991 --> 00:55:51,891
- This isn't easy. / - It must be so confusing... 

1368
00:55:51,891 --> 00:55:53,891
- The paths must look all the same. / - That's true. 

1369
00:55:53,891 --> 00:55:56,525
There is only one right path, 

1370
00:55:56,525 --> 00:55:59,458
so if both Baekho and I are on the right track, 

1371
00:55:59,458 --> 00:56:01,958
we will run into each other. Baekho. 

1372
00:56:03,025 --> 00:56:05,125
Baekho, can you hear me? 

1373
00:56:06,325 --> 00:56:09,458
(He can't hear him) 

1374
00:56:11,358 --> 00:56:12,358
(He tries to find the way with the camera but fails) 

1375
00:56:12,358 --> 00:56:14,125
I can't see the screen. 

1376
00:56:14,791 --> 00:56:15,825
What did I just do? 

1377
00:56:16,891 --> 00:56:17,958
What is this? 

1378
00:56:20,758 --> 00:56:21,858
There's a stone grave. 

1379
00:56:23,225 --> 00:56:24,991
That's where I have to go, right? 

1380
00:56:24,991 --> 00:56:27,958
(Baekho's destination seems nearby) 

1381
00:56:28,658 --> 00:56:30,458
- It's the eye of the dol hareubang. / - It's the eye. 

1382
00:56:30,458 --> 00:56:32,258
- Should I go this way? / - Everyone climbs up on... 

1383
00:56:32,258 --> 00:56:33,325
The stone grave... 

1384
00:56:33,325 --> 00:56:35,425
- And checks the way. / - You can check the way. 

1385
00:56:35,591 --> 00:56:38,258
- You can check where you are. / - Yes. 

1386
00:56:38,258 --> 00:56:39,358
But it doesn't help much. 

1387
00:56:40,191 --> 00:56:41,725
I can imagine that. 

1388
00:56:47,991 --> 00:56:50,258
There's another stone grave. I've been here before. 

1389
00:56:50,258 --> 00:56:53,891
(He sees a stone grave again) 

1390
00:56:53,891 --> 00:56:54,925
You were lost the whole time. 

1391
00:56:54,925 --> 00:56:57,125
I don't know the way out. I gave up already. 

1392
00:56:57,358 --> 00:57:01,525
(He keeps walking back to the eye of dol hareubang) 

1393
00:57:01,525 --> 00:57:03,591
You have to drop candies on the way. 

1394
00:57:05,358 --> 00:57:07,558
- That's clever. / - Dropping candies on the way. 

1395
00:57:07,558 --> 00:57:08,825
Yes. 

1396
00:57:09,525 --> 00:57:11,391
(Surprised) 

1397
00:57:13,491 --> 00:57:19,125
(He found JR) 

1398
00:57:20,025 --> 00:57:21,225
(Baekho runs to him) 

1399
00:57:21,225 --> 00:57:23,325
This is the right way. Now I found the way. 

1400
00:57:23,325 --> 00:57:25,058
It's so difficult to find a way here. 

1401
00:57:25,058 --> 00:57:26,291
(Baekho runs to him) 

1402
00:57:27,458 --> 00:57:30,391
I think Baekho will get lost around here. 

1403
00:57:30,891 --> 00:57:32,091
(Baekho is here) 

1404
00:57:32,091 --> 00:57:33,091
- He caught up. / - Trying to scare him. 

1405
00:57:33,091 --> 00:57:34,491
He approached me while I was talking. 

1406
00:57:35,591 --> 00:57:36,791
Why would I get lost, you punk? 

1407
00:57:36,791 --> 00:57:39,525
What the? 

1408
00:57:39,525 --> 00:57:41,491
What happened? 

1409
00:57:41,491 --> 00:57:42,891
- Why would I get lost? / - What? 

1410
00:57:42,891 --> 00:57:44,058
- When did you come? / - Why would I? 

1411
00:57:44,058 --> 00:57:46,958
(He runs away) 

1412
00:57:46,958 --> 00:57:48,058
That's not the right way. 

1413
00:57:48,858 --> 00:57:50,891
That's not it. There's a stone grave. 

1414
00:57:51,858 --> 00:57:52,858
It was the right way. 

1415
00:57:53,091 --> 00:57:55,491
- Really? / - Yes, I got out that way. 

1416
00:57:56,425 --> 00:57:58,191
I'm lost again. 

1417
00:57:58,625 --> 00:57:59,991
What was that? 

1418
00:57:59,991 --> 00:58:01,158
Why is Baekho so good? 

1419
00:58:01,158 --> 00:58:03,425
Did he take a picture of the map? 

1420
00:58:04,558 --> 00:58:06,258
I took a picture of it. 

1421
00:58:09,025 --> 00:58:10,491
He's the foul king. 

1422
00:58:10,858 --> 00:58:12,991
Each team has a foul king. 

1423
00:58:12,991 --> 00:58:15,558
I want Jun Jin and Baekho to play a game together. 

1424
00:58:16,625 --> 00:58:17,791
It's a map. 

1425
00:58:17,891 --> 00:58:18,991
Wait. 

1426
00:58:18,991 --> 00:58:21,158
(Baekho took a picture of the map before he began) 

1427
00:58:21,191 --> 00:58:22,358
I'm now... 

1428
00:58:22,358 --> 00:58:25,025
(Let me see) 

1429
00:58:25,025 --> 00:58:26,225
Please take a look at this. 

1430
00:58:26,691 --> 00:58:29,058
Do you know where I am now? 

1431
00:58:29,058 --> 00:58:30,658
He has the map but he can't read it. 

1432
00:58:30,991 --> 00:58:33,058
- Because you can't tell where you are now. / - Right. 

1433
00:58:34,058 --> 00:58:35,425
Can I look down on the top of it? 

1434
00:58:35,425 --> 00:58:38,458
(He goes up the stonewall) 

1435
00:58:38,458 --> 00:58:41,758
(He keeps climbing up) 

1436
00:58:41,758 --> 00:58:43,091
(He finds someone familiar from a distance) 

1437
00:58:43,091 --> 00:58:44,125
What? 

1438
00:58:44,125 --> 00:58:45,291
(There stands someone familiar) 

1439
00:58:45,291 --> 00:58:46,325
(JR already reached the line) 

1440
00:58:46,325 --> 00:58:47,325
What are you doing? 

1441
00:58:48,091 --> 00:58:49,625
- It took less than 30 minutes. / - Yes. 

1442
00:58:49,625 --> 00:58:50,891
What are you doing? 

1443
00:58:51,591 --> 00:58:54,991
(10 minutes ago) 

1444
00:58:55,291 --> 00:58:57,058
I should look at this. 

1445
00:58:57,658 --> 00:58:58,858
I'll use the picture. 

1446
00:58:58,858 --> 00:59:02,091
(JR also had the map) 

1447
00:59:04,125 --> 00:59:05,691
I knew it. 

1448
00:59:06,191 --> 00:59:08,391
I knew JR would do something. 

1449
00:59:08,558 --> 00:59:10,358
- You also had the map. / - He's amazing. 

1450
00:59:12,025 --> 00:59:14,491
(He finds the way out using the map) 

1451
00:59:14,491 --> 00:59:15,925
Okay. It's this way. 

1452
00:59:16,125 --> 00:59:18,558
JR, you could read the map? 

1453
00:59:18,758 --> 00:59:21,058
Yes. I memorized it. 

1454
00:59:21,525 --> 00:59:23,391
Here I am. 

1455
00:59:23,391 --> 00:59:24,591
(He gets Baekho's flag in 15 minutes) 

1456
00:59:24,591 --> 00:59:26,525
JR wins today. 

1457
00:59:27,558 --> 00:59:29,158
How are you so good? 

1458
00:59:29,158 --> 00:59:32,058
I memorized my way. 

1459
00:59:32,058 --> 00:59:34,491
Some people are good at that but some aren't. 

1460
00:59:34,991 --> 00:59:37,191
I should go. Gosh. 

1461
00:59:37,658 --> 00:59:39,758
(Baekho lost after wandering around) 

1462
00:59:39,758 --> 00:59:40,925
This doesn't suit me. 

1463
00:59:42,125 --> 00:59:43,525
He'd be good at the punishment though. 

1464
00:59:43,525 --> 00:59:44,691
This is hard. 

1465
00:59:46,191 --> 00:59:48,091
Here I go. 

1466
00:59:48,158 --> 00:59:49,558
It's 9 seconds. Start. 

1467
00:59:49,658 --> 00:59:51,058
How many times does he have to spin? 12 times? 

1468
00:59:51,058 --> 00:59:53,825
- 12 times. / - 1, 2, 3... 

1469
00:59:53,825 --> 00:59:55,125
I feel dizzy already. 

1470
00:59:55,125 --> 00:59:57,191
(He's trying hard for the penalty ) 

1471
00:59:57,558 --> 00:59:58,491
It's 12 seconds. 

1472
00:59:58,491 --> 01:00:00,425
(He keeps spinning over and over again) 

1473
01:00:00,425 --> 01:00:01,625
This isn't going to work. 

1474
01:00:02,258 --> 01:00:03,691
Here I go. 

1475
01:00:03,691 --> 01:00:05,291
(Baekho runs with his teeth set) 

1476
01:00:05,291 --> 01:00:07,091
You have to do the same pose as the statue. 

1477
01:00:09,258 --> 01:00:10,358
It's 8.01 seconds. 

1478
01:00:10,358 --> 01:00:12,058
(He finally succeeded) 

1479
01:00:12,525 --> 01:00:13,925
- Let's go now. / - 8 seconds. 

1480
01:00:13,925 --> 01:00:15,025
(He's tired from running) 

1481
01:00:15,491 --> 01:00:17,091
- Where are we going now? / - Let's... 

1482
01:00:17,591 --> 01:00:19,158
- Go eat. / - We're going to eat? 

1483
01:00:19,158 --> 01:00:20,458
- Okay. Let's go. / - Let's go. 

1484
01:00:20,858 --> 01:00:22,758
- That was amazing. / - I'm hungry. 

1485
01:00:22,758 --> 01:00:24,525
Let's eat. 

1486
01:00:24,525 --> 01:00:25,691
He must be hungry. 

1487
01:00:25,691 --> 01:00:28,391
(Baekho Tour Day 2, rockfish meal) 

1488
01:00:28,391 --> 01:00:30,658
- This place was really good. / - Rockfish set? 

1489
01:00:30,658 --> 01:00:33,325
- Rockfish meal? / - You have to try this restaurant. 

1490
01:00:34,025 --> 01:00:35,591
You studied a lot for this trip. 

1491
01:00:35,591 --> 01:00:37,091
- And searched for everything. / - Yes, I did. 

1492
01:00:37,091 --> 01:00:38,758
(He discovered a new dish of Jeju-do) 

1493
01:00:38,758 --> 01:00:40,858
JR would think we have to eat... 

1494
01:00:41,325 --> 01:00:45,591
Jeju Black pork or cold raw fish soup in Jeju-do. 

1495
01:00:46,291 --> 01:00:47,791
This must be really good. 

1496
01:00:49,258 --> 01:00:50,825
We have to eat this. 

1497
01:00:50,825 --> 01:00:52,125
It looks like a Chinese dish. 

1498
01:00:52,125 --> 01:00:54,491
That's not predictable. 

1499
01:00:55,091 --> 01:00:56,258
Gosh. 

1500
01:00:58,025 --> 01:01:05,425
(Predictable dishes of Jeju-do) 

1501
01:01:06,058 --> 01:01:09,858
(Special new taste of Jeju-do) 

1502
01:01:10,825 --> 01:01:16,358
(Deep-fried rockfish) 

1503
01:01:16,358 --> 01:01:20,691
(With a sweet sauce) 

1504
01:01:22,725 --> 01:01:25,058
We can also eat the bone. 

1505
01:01:25,558 --> 01:01:28,758
(It's chewy and crispy at the same time) 

1506
01:01:28,758 --> 01:01:29,891
Look at the flesh. 

1507
01:01:37,325 --> 01:01:39,325
I want to tear off the tail and eat it. 

1508
01:01:39,525 --> 01:01:40,791
The tail is so good. 

1509
01:01:40,791 --> 01:01:42,291
They serve deep-fried eel bones... 

1510
01:01:42,291 --> 01:01:43,758
- At an eel restaurant. / - Deep-fried eel bones? 

1511
01:01:43,758 --> 01:01:44,858
It tastes just like that. 

1512
01:01:46,291 --> 01:01:49,325
This isn't the Black pork restaurant I imagined. 

1513
01:01:49,458 --> 01:01:51,225
It's not Black pork. 

1514
01:01:52,058 --> 01:01:54,125
It's a rockfish set meal. 

1515
01:01:54,858 --> 01:01:56,125
Rockfish set? 

1516
01:01:56,125 --> 01:01:57,691
Alright, I'll just trust you. 

1517
01:01:57,691 --> 01:01:59,591
- Okay. / - I should trust you. 

1518
01:01:59,591 --> 01:02:01,658
- I'm sure it will be good. / - Okay. 

1519
01:02:03,291 --> 01:02:04,791
We usually eat rockfish raw. 

1520
01:02:04,791 --> 01:02:06,158
- Right. / - Exactly. 

1521
01:02:06,158 --> 01:02:07,791
- Or we eat braised rockfish. / - Right. 

1522
01:02:08,625 --> 01:02:09,858
The main dish... 

1523
01:02:10,191 --> 01:02:13,825
(Surprised) 

1524
01:02:13,825 --> 01:02:15,058
It looks amazing. 

1525
01:02:15,058 --> 01:02:17,791
(They are thrilled to see it) 

1526
01:02:17,791 --> 01:02:19,591
- It's here. / - What's this? 

1527
01:02:20,858 --> 01:02:22,791
(Deep-fried rockfish served with side dishes) 

1528
01:02:22,791 --> 01:02:25,225
You have to order at least two servings. 

1529
01:02:26,825 --> 01:02:30,691
(You can eat the head and fins of the rockfish) 

1530
01:02:30,691 --> 01:02:32,391
I've never seen deep-fried rockfish before. 

1531
01:02:32,391 --> 01:02:34,125
You should order 2 servings for 1 person. 

1532
01:02:34,125 --> 01:02:36,125
- 2 servings for 1 person? / - It's $24 for 2 servings? 

1533
01:02:36,125 --> 01:02:37,991
- Yes. / - It's not so expensive. 

1534
01:02:37,991 --> 01:02:39,791
We cooked two rockfishes as they are small. 

1535
01:02:39,791 --> 01:02:41,058
Really? 

1536
01:02:42,258 --> 01:02:43,758
They usually serve one rockfish 

1537
01:02:43,758 --> 01:02:45,325
but they cooked two as they were small. 

1538
01:02:45,958 --> 01:02:48,225
He's doing it with his hands. 

1539
01:02:48,225 --> 01:02:51,158
He pulls them apart for us to eat. 

1540
01:02:51,158 --> 01:02:52,925
- Please try this. / - Can we eat now? 

1541
01:02:53,425 --> 01:02:54,991
- You can eat it now. / - You eat the fins? 

1542
01:02:54,991 --> 01:02:56,091
We can eat now. 

1543
01:02:56,091 --> 01:02:57,758
The fins are really good. 

1544
01:02:58,458 --> 01:03:02,425
(He gives JR a fin too) 

1545
01:03:02,425 --> 01:03:03,791
My mouth is watering. 

1546
01:03:04,791 --> 01:03:09,758
(They taste the fin first) 

1547
01:03:11,758 --> 01:03:14,491
(Can you hear it?) 

1548
01:03:14,491 --> 01:03:15,625
(It sounds crispy) 

1549
01:03:15,625 --> 01:03:16,791
It's ASMR. 

1550
01:03:17,258 --> 01:03:18,858
(It sounds delicious) 

1551
01:03:19,291 --> 01:03:24,591
(It sounds crispy) 

1552
01:03:26,625 --> 01:03:27,758
It's good, isn't it? 

1553
01:03:28,191 --> 01:03:29,458
- Do you like it? / - Thank you. 

1554
01:03:29,458 --> 01:03:30,158
Thank you. 

1555
01:03:30,158 --> 01:03:31,225
This is so good. 

1556
01:03:34,691 --> 01:03:36,291
(Bowing out of gratitude) 

1557
01:03:38,191 --> 01:03:39,458
It must be so good. 

1558
01:03:41,225 --> 01:03:42,425
Thank you. 

1559
01:03:43,291 --> 01:03:44,591
This is amazing. 

1560
01:03:45,325 --> 01:03:46,825
I like the texture. 

1561
01:03:47,158 --> 01:03:48,491
It's very crispy. 

1562
01:03:48,891 --> 01:03:50,158
At an eel restaurant, 

1563
01:03:50,158 --> 01:03:51,925
they serve fried bones. 

1564
01:03:51,925 --> 01:03:53,525
It tastes like that. 

1565
01:03:53,525 --> 01:03:55,858
- Please enjoy. / - Thank you. 

1566
01:03:55,858 --> 01:03:57,025
He pulled them apart into bite-sized pieces. 

1567
01:03:57,025 --> 01:03:58,358
It will taste good with rice. 

1568
01:03:58,725 --> 01:03:59,825
Let's eat. 

1569
01:03:59,825 --> 01:04:01,525
(It's time to enjoy the dish) 

1570
01:04:01,525 --> 01:04:02,691
Didn't you order alcohol? 

1571
01:04:02,691 --> 01:04:05,191
- We didn't. / - Gosh, that's too bad. 

1572
01:04:05,191 --> 01:04:06,758
I wish I was there. 

1573
01:04:06,758 --> 01:04:09,625
There's something I really wanted to try. 

1574
01:04:09,625 --> 01:04:11,725
(JR wanted to try something when he saw the dish) 

1575
01:04:12,591 --> 01:04:13,891
Spoon the rice up... 

1576
01:04:14,658 --> 01:04:15,958
You should eat it with rice. 

1577
01:04:15,958 --> 01:04:17,258
The sauce must be delicious. 

1578
01:04:17,258 --> 01:04:18,525
The sauce is really good. 

1579
01:04:18,525 --> 01:04:20,425
(He puts a piece of rockfish on a spoonful of rice) 

1580
01:04:20,425 --> 01:04:24,458
(And he puts it in his mouth) 

1581
01:04:26,558 --> 01:04:31,491
(Baekho takes a big bite too) 

1582
01:04:32,491 --> 01:04:33,791
(It tastes like) 

1583
01:04:33,791 --> 01:04:34,958
This is so good. 

1584
01:04:35,658 --> 01:04:38,025
(Bravo!) 

1585
01:04:38,025 --> 01:04:39,225
I love it. 

1586
01:04:40,025 --> 01:04:43,658
Thank you, Baekho. 

1587
01:04:43,658 --> 01:04:45,191
(He is grateful) 

1588
01:04:45,191 --> 01:04:46,558
This is really good. 

1589
01:04:47,525 --> 01:04:49,025
It's very crispy. 

1590
01:04:49,025 --> 01:04:50,625
And the flesh is so firm. 

1591
01:04:50,625 --> 01:04:51,991
(It's a perfect harmony of crispiness and firm flesh) 

1592
01:04:51,991 --> 01:04:54,758
The sauce is sweet. 

1593
01:04:54,758 --> 01:04:57,025
- It's sweet and salty. / - It must be great. 

1594
01:04:57,025 --> 01:04:58,691
It is even better because... 

1595
01:04:59,391 --> 01:05:00,591
Each part tastes different. 

1596
01:05:00,591 --> 01:05:01,891
Exactly. I like that. 

1597
01:05:01,891 --> 01:05:03,725
Each part has a different level of crispiness. 

1598
01:05:04,358 --> 01:05:05,758
And they taste different. 

1599
01:05:06,158 --> 01:05:07,325
It's so good. 

1600
01:05:07,325 --> 01:05:10,491
(It's time to munch on the dish) 

1601
01:05:10,491 --> 01:05:12,058
It sounds so crispy. 

1602
01:05:12,858 --> 01:05:16,425
(He takes a big bite) 

1603
01:05:16,625 --> 01:05:17,691
(He can't stop eating) 

1604
01:05:17,691 --> 01:05:19,325
And the bean paste stew served with it... 

1605
01:05:19,325 --> 01:05:20,658
- Was really good. / - That's right. 

1606
01:05:22,158 --> 01:05:23,458
(It is the happiest moment) 

1607
01:05:23,458 --> 01:05:24,658
I'm happy. 

1608
01:05:25,425 --> 01:05:28,225
(He's looking for something) 

1609
01:05:28,991 --> 01:05:30,291
How many fins did you eat? 

1610
01:05:31,158 --> 01:05:33,358
What? 

1611
01:05:33,358 --> 01:05:34,858
(He's eating a fin) 

1612
01:05:34,858 --> 01:05:36,725
(He chews it carefully) 

1613
01:05:36,725 --> 01:05:38,491
- What did you say? / - How many fins did you eat? 

1614
01:05:39,525 --> 01:05:41,358
We fought over fins. 

1615
01:05:41,358 --> 01:05:43,558
- Really? / - We rarely eat fins. 

1616
01:05:43,758 --> 01:05:44,825
He argued. 

1617
01:05:44,825 --> 01:05:46,625
- "How many fins did you have?" / - I only had one. 

1618
01:05:46,625 --> 01:05:49,191
(But there's none left) 

1619
01:05:49,725 --> 01:05:53,858
(Did I eat three fins?) 

1620
01:05:56,425 --> 01:05:58,358
- There's one. / - It's here. 

1621
01:05:58,358 --> 01:05:59,991
- You can eat it. / - No, you should eat it. 

1622
01:05:59,991 --> 01:06:01,058
I don't want it. 

1623
01:06:01,058 --> 01:06:02,925
- You can eat it. / - My gosh. 

1624
01:06:02,925 --> 01:06:03,991
No, you should. 

1625
01:06:03,991 --> 01:06:05,791
- You eat the fin. / - It's okay. 

1626
01:06:05,791 --> 01:06:07,391
I'll eat the big bone. 

1627
01:06:07,858 --> 01:06:09,191
Is he going to feed him that personally? 

1628
01:06:09,191 --> 01:06:10,825
I'll eat it then. 

1629
01:06:10,825 --> 01:06:12,158
My gosh. 

1630
01:06:12,158 --> 01:06:13,425
(JR finally eats the fin) 

1631
01:06:15,291 --> 01:06:16,391
That's rare. 

1632
01:06:16,625 --> 01:06:17,758
- You should try this. / - See? 

1633
01:06:18,691 --> 01:06:19,791
See? 

1634
01:06:19,791 --> 01:06:21,925
(Dongwan's prediction was right) 

1635
01:06:21,925 --> 01:06:23,325
I knew it. 

1636
01:06:23,325 --> 01:06:24,591
(He feels shy all of a sudden) 

1637
01:06:24,591 --> 01:06:25,825
How did you know that, Dongwan? 

1638
01:06:25,825 --> 01:06:27,991
We did the same thing 20 years ago. 

1639
01:06:27,991 --> 01:06:30,358
20 years ago? 

1640
01:06:31,525 --> 01:06:32,658
This is really good. 

1641
01:06:36,858 --> 01:06:38,158
This is the best meal. 

1642
01:06:39,958 --> 01:06:41,258
Gosh, I really want to try it. 

1643
01:06:41,258 --> 01:06:43,825
(He ate it up already) 

1644
01:06:43,825 --> 01:06:45,091
Do you want more rice? 

1645
01:06:46,791 --> 01:06:47,891
Okay. 

1646
01:06:47,891 --> 01:06:49,558
Can we get 2 more bowls of rice? 

1647
01:06:49,558 --> 01:06:50,758
(Baekho emptied his rice too) 

1648
01:06:50,758 --> 01:06:52,891
- Thank you. / - We have to... 

1649
01:06:52,891 --> 01:06:55,158
- Order more rice for this. / - You need 2 bowls. 

1650
01:06:55,158 --> 01:06:57,625
- You two really liked the dish. / - Right. 

1651
01:06:57,625 --> 01:06:59,625
I don't usually eat two bowls of rice. 

1652
01:06:59,625 --> 01:07:01,225
You should eat a lot when you're on a trip. 

1653
01:07:01,591 --> 01:07:02,825
He eats a lot because it's that good. 

1654
01:07:04,558 --> 01:07:08,358
(They start eating the rockfish again) 

1655
01:07:09,125 --> 01:07:13,491
(Gobbling up) 

1656
01:07:15,658 --> 01:07:16,958
(They keep eating without a break) 

1657
01:07:16,958 --> 01:07:18,125
It's good. 

1658
01:07:21,391 --> 01:07:22,791
(Rice bowls piled up) 

1659
01:07:22,791 --> 01:07:24,158
- They ate their fill. / - Four bowls. 

1660
01:07:24,958 --> 01:07:26,458
We should reflect on ourselves looking in a mirror. 

1661
01:07:26,458 --> 01:07:28,258
(They emptied the second bowls too) 

1662
01:07:28,258 --> 01:07:29,858
It's been so long since I had two bowls of rice. 

1663
01:07:29,858 --> 01:07:30,291
Me too. 

1664
01:07:31,191 --> 01:07:32,491
I tried not to eat too much. 

1665
01:07:32,491 --> 01:07:34,458
Baekho is a gourmand, right? 

1666
01:07:34,658 --> 01:07:36,158
- Yes, I like to eat a lot. / - I thought so. 

1667
01:07:36,158 --> 01:07:37,258
My gosh, we're in trouble. 

1668
01:07:37,258 --> 01:07:38,625
(Traces of refraining) 

1669
01:07:38,625 --> 01:07:41,591
I forgot about the Black pork as soon as I ate this. 

1670
01:07:42,291 --> 01:07:44,158
I really wanted to eat it. 

1671
01:07:44,158 --> 01:07:45,525
But I forgot about the Black pork after eating this. 

1672
01:07:45,525 --> 01:07:46,358
That's good. 

1673
01:07:46,358 --> 01:07:48,225
They also sell braised rockfish there too. 

1674
01:07:48,225 --> 01:07:49,625
So you can choose whatever you want to eat. 

1675
01:07:50,791 --> 01:07:53,058
Are we going home now? 

1676
01:07:53,758 --> 01:07:55,225
We have one thing left. 

1677
01:07:55,725 --> 01:07:57,325
We have to end the trip now. 

1678
01:07:57,325 --> 01:07:58,325
Are we going to have dessert? 

1679
01:07:58,325 --> 01:08:00,225
(The end? Dessert?) 

1680
01:08:00,225 --> 01:08:01,491
- Isn't it dessert? / - Yes, it is. 

1681
01:08:01,491 --> 01:08:03,058
- Is there dessert? / - Did I act that way that day? 

1682
01:08:03,491 --> 01:08:05,225
It doesn't feel like dessert. 

1683
01:08:05,925 --> 01:08:08,091
But we're going to end the trip there. 

1684
01:08:08,091 --> 01:08:10,091
- We'll organize our thoughts... / - The end? 

1685
01:08:10,658 --> 01:08:11,991
And go back to our daily lives. 

1686
01:08:13,391 --> 01:08:14,825
(They shake hands for the last time before they go) 

1687
01:08:14,825 --> 01:08:16,625
- They're shaking hands again. / - Very satisfied. 

1688
01:08:16,625 --> 01:08:17,991
Thank you. 

1689
01:08:19,291 --> 01:08:21,458
Baekho worked so hard for this trip. 

1690
01:08:21,458 --> 01:08:22,958
I worked hard on the research. 

1691
01:08:24,025 --> 01:08:25,758
I saw this place earlier and it was really nice. 

1692
01:08:26,158 --> 01:08:27,691
The atmosphere is amazing. 

1693
01:08:28,425 --> 01:08:31,258
I think it will be a really nice place 

1694
01:08:31,258 --> 01:08:34,258
to prepare ourselves to go back to our daily lives. 

1695
01:08:34,258 --> 01:08:35,825
This place is so nice. 

1696
01:08:36,225 --> 01:08:37,225
(Baekho Tour Day 2) 

1697
01:08:37,225 --> 01:08:38,891
This is where we ended it. It's a cafe. 

1698
01:08:39,225 --> 01:08:40,658
It's a really unique cafe. 

1699
01:08:40,658 --> 01:08:42,358
(22 minutes by car to the mountain cabin cafe) 

1700
01:08:46,425 --> 01:08:47,791
What is that? 

1701
01:08:47,791 --> 01:08:50,291
This is a cafe made by renovating a stable. 

1702
01:08:50,291 --> 01:08:51,925
It really feels vintage. 

1703
01:08:51,925 --> 01:08:54,391
(A mountain cabin-like cafe that renovated a stable) 

1704
01:08:55,791 --> 01:08:57,391
(It boasts a unique atmosphere) 

1705
01:08:57,391 --> 01:09:00,091
- It's amazing. / - Oh, my. 

1706
01:09:03,025 --> 01:09:04,491
- That's so cute. / - They even do... 

1707
01:09:04,491 --> 01:09:07,558
Live performances there sometimes. 

1708
01:09:07,891 --> 01:09:09,191
Isn't it nice? 

1709
01:09:09,658 --> 01:09:11,291
I really tried hard to find this place. 

1710
01:09:11,291 --> 01:09:13,191
You can start a campfire outside. 

1711
01:09:13,191 --> 01:09:14,491
How is it? 

1712
01:09:15,491 --> 01:09:17,991
It feels old... 

1713
01:09:17,991 --> 01:09:19,491
(You can feel a sense of old sensitivity here) 

1714
01:09:19,491 --> 01:09:21,758
But I think it's the best place... 

1715
01:09:21,758 --> 01:09:23,725
- To be the last course. / - Right? 

1716
01:09:25,791 --> 01:09:29,258
I picked this place from only looking at photos. 

1717
01:09:29,258 --> 01:09:32,058
The atmosphere is even better than the photos. 

1718
01:09:32,058 --> 01:09:33,891
- You chose the perfect spot. / - Yes. 

1719
01:09:34,891 --> 01:09:36,325
- And... / - Did you see this? 

1720
01:09:38,758 --> 01:09:39,991
Do you know what this is? 

1721
01:09:40,558 --> 01:09:43,691
It signifies the business hours. 

1722
01:09:43,691 --> 01:09:45,091
This is the business hours. 

1723
01:09:46,025 --> 01:09:47,558
How is this the business hours? 

1724
01:09:47,558 --> 01:09:50,725
They light it when the sun is about to set. 

1725
01:09:51,025 --> 01:09:53,025
When the candles go out, business is over. 

1726
01:09:54,891 --> 01:09:56,558
- That's interesting. / - When the candle goes out... 

1727
01:09:56,558 --> 01:09:57,658
They close the cafe. 

1728
01:09:57,658 --> 01:09:59,591
(Open from 11 a.m. until the candle is out) 

1729
01:10:00,525 --> 01:10:02,858
(Their drinks are here) 

1730
01:10:02,858 --> 01:10:04,025
Thank you. 

1731
01:10:04,491 --> 01:10:06,291
The tray is also really unique. 

1732
01:10:07,091 --> 01:10:09,058
- This is Irish coffee. / - It's coffee with whiskey. 

1733
01:10:09,458 --> 01:10:10,658
It's their signature menu. 

1734
01:10:10,658 --> 01:10:13,025
(Irish coffee, $10 for 1 glass) 

1735
01:10:13,025 --> 01:10:16,825
(Non-alcohol Irish coffee for Baekho) 

1736
01:10:17,058 --> 01:10:19,058
- It's really good. / - Yes. 

1737
01:10:19,458 --> 01:10:20,758
(They drink it while appreciating it slowly) 

1738
01:10:20,758 --> 01:10:22,425
It's really good. 

1739
01:10:23,258 --> 01:10:25,325
- It's a taste I never had before. / - Yes. 

1740
01:10:25,725 --> 01:10:27,058
It's better than you expect. 

1741
01:10:27,391 --> 01:10:29,358
- It's good. / - It's really good. 

1742
01:10:29,858 --> 01:10:33,225
It's sweet but the bitterness of the coffee is well mixed. 

1743
01:10:33,225 --> 01:10:34,691
I think this isn't bad. 

1744
01:10:34,691 --> 01:10:35,925
It's really good. 

1745
01:10:35,925 --> 01:10:37,091
They sell wine, right? 

1746
01:10:37,391 --> 01:10:39,558
I think they also sell alcohol. 

1747
01:10:39,558 --> 01:10:41,125
You must have become really close. 

1748
01:10:41,125 --> 01:10:42,925
- Though you were already close. / - We were... 

1749
01:10:42,925 --> 01:10:44,491
We did a lot of things. 

1750
01:10:44,491 --> 01:10:46,091
We really did a lot of things. 

1751
01:10:46,091 --> 01:10:47,791
- It's the first trip for me. / - Right. 

1752
01:10:47,791 --> 01:10:50,325
- It's your first time. / - I'm 24 years old. 

1753
01:10:50,325 --> 01:10:52,791
In fact, I worried about it a lot. 

1754
01:10:52,791 --> 01:10:55,925
I didn't know if I would think it was fun. 

1755
01:10:55,925 --> 01:10:58,325
I didn't know if I would be interested. 

1756
01:10:59,125 --> 01:11:01,625
From yesterday up to today... 

1757
01:11:02,291 --> 01:11:04,091
I realized that... 

1758
01:11:04,091 --> 01:11:07,258
I still haven't seen so many things. 

1759
01:11:07,258 --> 01:11:09,958
I think I was so happy. 

1760
01:11:09,958 --> 01:11:13,091
I liked that I was getting to learn about new things. 

1761
01:11:13,358 --> 01:11:16,191
I made a lot of new memories on this trip. 

1762
01:11:16,191 --> 01:11:17,058
I'm relieved. 

1763
01:11:17,058 --> 01:11:20,125
I think I would want to 

1764
01:11:20,125 --> 01:11:21,691
travel a lot from now on. 

1765
01:11:22,725 --> 01:11:26,691
It's the first time I went on a trip after planning it. 

1766
01:11:28,558 --> 01:11:32,191
It made me feel really proud... 

1767
01:11:32,591 --> 01:11:35,058
That you liked... 

1768
01:11:35,458 --> 01:11:37,258
What I searched and learned about. 

1769
01:11:37,258 --> 01:11:39,558
(Baekho was proud because his friend was satisfied) 

1770
01:11:41,225 --> 01:11:43,191
It feels weird to watch this. 

1771
01:11:43,958 --> 01:11:45,391
Don't cry. 

1772
01:11:45,391 --> 01:11:46,658
I'm not going to cry. 

1773
01:11:46,658 --> 01:11:48,358
Don't do things like crying. 

1774
01:11:48,358 --> 01:11:49,358
Thank you. 

1775
01:11:50,025 --> 01:11:52,258
I know. The trip was fun. 

1776
01:11:52,258 --> 01:11:53,358
It was fun. 

1777
01:11:53,925 --> 01:11:56,125
My left arm is really heavy right now. 

1778
01:11:56,125 --> 01:11:57,691
(Baekho's left arm is really heavy) 

1779
01:11:58,291 --> 01:11:59,491
I'm going to... 

1780
01:11:59,491 --> 01:12:00,725
(The armband he was wearing during the trip) 

1781
01:12:00,725 --> 01:12:01,891
Take this off now. 

1782
01:12:03,358 --> 01:12:04,958
Will you give me your left arm? 

1783
01:12:05,391 --> 01:12:07,191
Take this... 

1784
01:12:07,191 --> 01:12:12,458
And plan a trip when you go to Gangneung. 

1785
01:12:13,091 --> 01:12:14,625
You should take one of our members on a trip. 

1786
01:12:15,525 --> 01:12:17,791
Ren would be nice. 

1787
01:12:17,791 --> 01:12:19,125
(His arm suddenly feels heavy) 

1788
01:12:19,125 --> 01:12:20,291
His facial expression changed. 

1789
01:12:20,291 --> 01:12:21,958
Planner JR, are you confident? 

1790
01:12:22,491 --> 01:12:24,325
Let's go with all of our members. 

1791
01:12:24,925 --> 01:12:26,225
Let's go together. 

1792
01:12:26,225 --> 01:12:28,825
You'll have a driving license by then, right? 

1793
01:12:28,891 --> 01:12:31,558
- Should I get it for this? / - You don't have a license? 

1794
01:12:31,558 --> 01:12:33,425
- I got it now. / - He didn't have one then. 

1795
01:12:33,425 --> 01:12:34,958
He's got it now. 

1796
01:12:34,958 --> 01:12:36,925
- Should we chant our slogan? / - We'll come back? 

1797
01:12:36,925 --> 01:12:39,225
- Of course, we'll come back. / - Then... 

1798
01:12:39,225 --> 01:12:39,991
I will be back. 

1799
01:12:40,358 --> 01:12:42,258
- I'll be back? Okay. / - Okay? 

1800
01:12:42,258 --> 01:12:43,591
- Okay, let's go. / - Okay. 

1801
01:12:44,925 --> 01:12:46,425
- I will... / - Be back. 

1802
01:12:46,425 --> 01:12:47,991
Baekho Tour. 

1803
01:12:47,991 --> 01:12:49,325
(Baekho Tour will be back) 

1804
01:12:51,058 --> 01:12:55,691
(The end of Baekho Tour) 

1805
01:12:55,691 --> 01:12:57,058
That was good. 

1806
01:12:57,058 --> 01:12:58,458
I didn't know that Jeju-do produced buckwheat 

1807
01:12:58,458 --> 01:12:59,491
that much. 

1808
01:12:59,491 --> 01:13:02,158
- That's right. / - I didn't know that either. 

1809
01:13:02,158 --> 01:13:05,691
When you travel to Jeju-do, you will see gardens... 

1810
01:13:05,691 --> 01:13:07,458
- With white flowers. / - That's right. 

1811
01:13:07,458 --> 01:13:09,091
They're the buckwheat fields. 

1812
01:13:09,091 --> 01:13:11,225
Bongpyeong's famous for buckwheat noodles. 

1813
01:13:11,225 --> 01:13:13,891
Jeju-do is also famous for buckwheat noodles. 

1814
01:13:13,891 --> 01:13:15,925
- If you go to Ora-dong in Jeju-do... / - Yes. 

1815
01:13:15,925 --> 01:13:18,291
- There is a big buckwheat field. / - Yes. 

1816
01:13:18,291 --> 01:13:21,025
You can take great photos there. 

1817
01:13:21,025 --> 01:13:23,925
People from Jeju-do like buckwheat flour... 

1818
01:13:23,925 --> 01:13:25,491
- So they put it in a lot of soup. / - Yes. 

1819
01:13:25,491 --> 01:13:27,658
- Is that right? / - Yes, that's right. 

1820
01:13:27,891 --> 01:13:29,558
He's good. 

1821
01:13:29,558 --> 01:13:30,358
The fake dialect sounds real 

1822
01:13:30,358 --> 01:13:31,925
and the real dialect sounds fake. 

1823
01:13:31,925 --> 01:13:33,258
My dialect is real. 

1824
01:13:33,825 --> 01:13:36,691
I have a lot of friends from Jeju-do, so I used it a lot. 

1825
01:13:37,391 --> 01:13:39,158
- That's right. / - "Musamasin." 

1826
01:13:39,158 --> 01:13:41,391
- Musamasin. / - What does that mean? 

1827
01:13:41,391 --> 01:13:42,325
"Why." 

1828
01:13:42,325 --> 01:13:43,425
- "Musamasin?" / - Yes. 

1829
01:13:43,825 --> 01:13:45,291
Let's see the final expense. 

1830
01:13:45,291 --> 01:13:46,391
How much did they spend? 

1831
01:13:47,191 --> 01:13:48,258
We also ate a lot. 

1832
01:13:48,258 --> 01:13:50,858
Wan Jun Tour spent quite a lot, $320. 

1833
01:13:50,858 --> 01:13:54,991
We used $323 per person for 2 days and 1 night. 

1834
01:13:54,991 --> 01:13:57,325
- We spent a lot. / - You rented a convertible. 

1835
01:13:57,325 --> 01:14:00,891
What is the final expense of Baekho Tour... 

1836
01:14:00,891 --> 01:14:02,125
- Excluding airfare? / - Yes. 

1837
01:14:02,125 --> 01:14:04,291
- Per person. / - Per person. 

1838
01:14:04,291 --> 01:14:06,858
$287. 

1839
01:14:06,858 --> 01:14:08,558
- It's similar. / - We won. 

1840
01:14:08,558 --> 01:14:10,291
As we already mentioned, 

1841
01:14:10,291 --> 01:14:12,825
It'd be the same if we didn't rent the convertible. 

1842
01:14:12,825 --> 01:14:14,758
The tumbling activity cost more than $50. 

1843
01:14:14,991 --> 01:14:16,591
- Yes. / - That was expensive. 

1844
01:14:16,591 --> 01:14:18,125
Their lodging was expensive. 

1845
01:14:18,125 --> 01:14:20,125
- That's right. / - Their lodging was expensive. 

1846
01:14:20,125 --> 01:14:23,225
Let's hear their last words before the vote. 

1847
01:14:23,225 --> 01:14:25,991
Baekho Tour, please tell us your last words 

1848
01:14:25,991 --> 01:14:26,925
before the vote. 

1849
01:14:26,925 --> 01:14:30,525
This was my first time going on a trip 

1850
01:14:30,525 --> 01:14:32,725
and I didn't know how to enjoy it. 

1851
01:14:32,725 --> 01:14:34,558
I didn't go on trips because of that. 

1852
01:14:34,558 --> 01:14:38,958
Thanks to this chance, I learned how fun traveling is. 

1853
01:14:38,958 --> 01:14:41,891
If you've never gone on a trip, 

1854
01:14:41,891 --> 01:14:44,291
I recommend going to Jeju-do for your first trip. 

1855
01:14:44,291 --> 01:14:45,491
- It was so nice. / - Yes. 

1856
01:14:45,958 --> 01:14:47,191
For 1 night and 2 days, 

1857
01:14:47,191 --> 01:14:50,191
there isn't a better course than Jeju-do. 

1858
01:14:50,191 --> 01:14:52,658
- You mean Jeju City. / - Jeju City! 

1859
01:14:52,991 --> 01:14:53,858
Jeju City is good. 

1860
01:14:53,858 --> 01:14:56,158
- Jeju City is the best among them. / - That's right. 

1861
01:14:56,158 --> 01:14:57,991
- You're emphasizing it. / - It's really nice. 

1862
01:14:58,491 --> 01:15:00,758
Please visit 

1863
01:15:01,858 --> 01:15:02,991
Are you ready to vote? 

1864
01:15:02,991 --> 01:15:04,425
Would you go on a trip to Jeju City 

1865
01:15:04,425 --> 01:15:06,658
according to Baekho Tour? 

1866
01:15:06,658 --> 01:15:09,291
Please vote. 

1867
01:15:10,991 --> 01:15:14,325
(Baekho Tour was designed by Baekho from Jeju-do) 

1868
01:15:14,725 --> 01:15:18,525
(What will the judges choose?) 

1869
01:15:20,125 --> 01:15:21,958
They say it's really close. 

1870
01:15:21,958 --> 01:15:24,125
Will it be SHINHWA who showed their 20 years of 

1871
01:15:24,125 --> 01:15:28,391
experience through Wan Jun Tour to Seogwipo? 

1872
01:15:28,391 --> 01:15:30,958
Or will it be NU'EST W's Baekho Tour 

1873
01:15:30,958 --> 01:15:33,058
to Jeju City? 

1874
01:15:33,058 --> 01:15:35,625
What will the judges choose? 

1875
01:15:35,625 --> 01:15:38,391
Here we go. They said it was a close match. 

1876
01:15:39,391 --> 01:15:41,158
- What will happen? / - Wan Jun Tour. 

1877
01:15:41,158 --> 01:15:43,525
- Wan Jun Tour. / - Wan Jun Tour. 

1878
01:15:43,525 --> 01:15:47,625
- Wan Jun Tour. / - Wan Jun Tour. 

1879
01:15:47,625 --> 01:15:49,125
Okay. 

1880
01:15:49,625 --> 01:15:51,258
The first digit is the same! 

1881
01:15:51,458 --> 01:15:53,425
The first digit is the same! 

1882
01:15:53,425 --> 01:15:55,591
- It's the same. / - No. 

1883
01:15:55,591 --> 01:15:57,958
- It's over. / - Gosh. 

1884
01:15:57,958 --> 01:15:59,025
(Who won this match?) 

1885
01:16:02,425 --> 01:16:03,725
Congratulations. 

1886
01:16:03,725 --> 01:16:05,491
(Baekho Tour wins) 

1887
01:16:05,491 --> 01:16:08,291
- Congratulations. / - Thank you. 

1888
01:16:08,858 --> 01:16:11,558
75 votes is a lot. 

1889
01:16:11,558 --> 01:16:14,525
- Yes. / - I'm sorry, but to be honest... 

1890
01:16:14,891 --> 01:16:16,425
I was attracted to this trip more. 

1891
01:16:16,925 --> 01:16:18,258
- That's right. / - That's right. 

1892
01:16:18,258 --> 01:16:21,225
Maybe it's because we're all getting old together. 

1893
01:16:21,225 --> 01:16:23,725
- The course was so meaningful. / - It just... 

1894
01:16:23,725 --> 01:16:25,458
Made me feel theirs was better. 

1895
01:16:25,458 --> 01:16:26,891
I haven't felt that way in a while. 

1896
01:16:26,891 --> 01:16:28,791
- But our team won. / - Yes. 

1897
01:16:28,991 --> 01:16:32,158
Well, I think we were satisfied 

1898
01:16:32,158 --> 01:16:34,025
with our trip regardless of the result. 

1899
01:16:34,025 --> 01:16:35,091
We think we did a good job. 

1900
01:16:35,091 --> 01:16:37,491
It was nice to see that they had fun and relaxed... 

1901
01:16:37,491 --> 01:16:40,258
- When they're so busy. / - They relaxed well. 

1902
01:16:40,258 --> 01:16:42,925
It made me feel like I was watching my little brothers. 

1903
01:16:42,925 --> 01:16:45,191
- Nice, Dongwan. / - I also would have voted for them. 

1904
01:16:46,191 --> 01:16:48,491
- It was a relaxing trip. / - Let's hear your thoughts. 

1905
01:16:48,491 --> 01:16:49,658
- Your thoughts after winning. / - Baekho, tell us. 

1906
01:16:49,658 --> 01:16:52,125
- I thought their trip was also... / - Yes. 

1907
01:16:52,125 --> 01:16:54,591
- Really nice. / - Yes. 

1908
01:16:54,591 --> 01:16:57,825
That's why I want to go to Seogwipo 

1909
01:16:57,825 --> 01:16:59,225
when I go traveling to Jeju-do again. 

1910
01:16:59,725 --> 01:17:00,791
- I want to go there. / - We'll go to Jeju City next time. 

1911
01:17:00,791 --> 01:17:02,691
- I really want to go there. / - Me too. 

1912
01:17:02,691 --> 01:17:03,791
- Yes. / - It was so fun. 

1913
01:17:03,791 --> 01:17:04,991
How about you, JR? 

1914
01:17:04,991 --> 01:17:07,425
If I go on a trip to Jeju-do again, 

1915
01:17:07,425 --> 01:17:08,758
I will go for 4 nights and 5 days. 

1916
01:17:09,558 --> 01:17:11,791
I want to go to the places I went to in Jeju City again, 

1917
01:17:11,791 --> 01:17:14,258
and the places where they went to looked so nice. 

1918
01:17:14,258 --> 01:17:17,025
I really want to try the RC car. 

1919
01:17:17,525 --> 01:17:19,125
I really want to enjoy it 

1920
01:17:19,125 --> 01:17:21,191
while wandering the street. 

1921
01:17:21,191 --> 01:17:22,425
It was so fun. 

1922
01:17:23,791 --> 01:17:26,391
It's been a while since we've seen SHINHWA. 

1923
01:17:26,391 --> 01:17:28,858
- Yes. / - We went to nice places... 

1924
01:17:28,858 --> 01:17:32,391
But NU'EST W also went to a lot of nice places. 

1925
01:17:32,391 --> 01:17:34,358
- I really want to go later again. / - That's good. 

1926
01:17:34,358 --> 01:17:36,758
- Dayoung, I almost forgot. / - Yes. 

1927
01:17:36,758 --> 01:17:39,325
Thank you so much for speaking in the Jeju-do dialect. 

1928
01:17:39,325 --> 01:17:41,691
- It was fun. / - Thank you. 

1929
01:17:41,691 --> 01:17:45,191
I would like to let you know SHINHWA just released 

1930
01:17:45,191 --> 01:17:46,825
their 20th-anniversary album. 

1931
01:17:46,825 --> 01:17:48,858
- I hope the best for you. / - Good luck. 

1932
01:17:48,858 --> 01:17:49,958
Thank you. 

1933
01:17:50,825 --> 01:17:53,758
Dayoung, you were with us for 2 weeks. 

1934
01:17:53,758 --> 01:17:55,058
- Yes. / - How was it? 

1935
01:17:55,058 --> 01:17:58,525
I was on the show for the Jeju-do special. 

1936
01:17:58,525 --> 01:18:01,525
They say that the people who recently came back 

1937
01:18:01,525 --> 01:18:03,958
from Jeju-do knows the most about it. 

1938
01:18:03,958 --> 01:18:06,158
I think that's true. 

1939
01:18:06,158 --> 01:18:09,291
- I heard some news. / - Yes. 

1940
01:18:09,291 --> 01:18:11,991
There's a rumor that you will go on a trip 

1941
01:18:11,991 --> 01:18:14,058
if you were a special host. 

1942
01:18:14,058 --> 01:18:16,358
- It was the same for JR. / - Yes, it was. 

1943
01:18:16,691 --> 01:18:20,391
I really want to go on a trip for Battle Trip. 

1944
01:18:22,358 --> 01:18:23,458
(We will look forward to Dayoung's trip) 

1945
01:18:23,458 --> 01:18:25,858
We always have a new special. 

1946
01:18:25,858 --> 01:18:28,091
- Is it a special next week? / - It's embarrassing... 

1947
01:18:28,091 --> 01:18:30,191
But it's a trip for sisters. 

1948
01:18:30,258 --> 01:18:32,658
The representative sisters of celebrities will be here. 

1949
01:18:32,658 --> 01:18:33,491
It's a special for real sisters. 

1950
01:18:33,491 --> 01:18:36,825
Yes, please look forward to the sisters special. 

1951
01:18:36,825 --> 01:18:39,125
We will come back next Saturday. 

1952
01:18:39,125 --> 01:18:41,291
The world is your school. Life is a journey. 

1953
01:18:41,291 --> 01:18:43,858
Battle Trip. 

1954
01:18:46,325 --> 01:18:47,325
(Next episode) 

1955
01:18:48,591 --> 01:18:51,325
(Xiamen, China, Yang Heeeun and Yang Heekyung) 

1956
01:18:51,325 --> 01:18:54,025
It's been a long time, just the two of us. 

1957
01:18:54,925 --> 01:18:57,525
I'm filled with expectation. 

1958
01:18:57,725 --> 01:18:59,058
How would it taste? 

1959
01:18:59,325 --> 01:19:01,958
Hold hands like this all day. 

1960
01:19:01,958 --> 01:19:06,491
Today was like an unexpected gift. 

1961
01:19:08,458 --> 01:19:12,125
(Kenting, Taiwan, Mijoo and Jisoo of Lovelyz) 

1962
01:19:15,258 --> 01:19:17,425
Isn't that ocean too blue? 

1963
01:19:17,425 --> 01:19:19,758
- It's the same color as the sky. / - I know. 

1964
01:19:20,058 --> 01:19:21,325
Each of these become memory. 

1965
01:19:21,325 --> 01:19:23,358
And they're all fascinating experiences. 

1966
01:19:23,358 --> 01:19:24,658
It was great. 

1967
01:19:24,658 --> 01:19:27,358
