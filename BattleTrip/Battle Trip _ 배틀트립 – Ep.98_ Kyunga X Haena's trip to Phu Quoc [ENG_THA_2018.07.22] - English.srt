00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:03,140
(Numerous great tips on trips)

2
00:00:04,874 --> 00:00:06,307
(Kim Sook, Sung Sikyung)

3
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:08,107
(Lee Hwijae, special host, JR of NU'EST W)

4
00:00:08,407 --> 00:00:09,707
Travel is war.

5
00:00:09,707 --> 00:00:11,707
Battle Trip!

6
00:00:14,274 --> 00:00:17,307
The audience is cheering loudly today.

7
00:00:17,307 --> 00:00:18,707
Today's special host

8
00:00:18,707 --> 00:00:21,174
is JR of NU'EST W.

9
00:00:21,174 --> 00:00:22,307
Nice to meet you.

10
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:26,774
I'm here as a special host today.

11
00:00:26,774 --> 00:00:29,307
I'll work hard and try to enjoy the trips.

12
00:00:29,307 --> 00:00:30,407
Thank you.

13
00:00:32,307 --> 00:00:33,807
Do you like traveling?

14
00:00:33,807 --> 00:00:34,874
I like traveling

15
00:00:34,874 --> 00:00:36,874
but I don't have time...

16
00:00:36,874 --> 00:00:38,840
- To travel around. / - Right.

17
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:40,874
Have you been on a trip before? A personal trip.

18
00:00:40,874 --> 00:00:42,040
- Not for work. / - A real trip.

19
00:00:42,474 --> 00:00:43,907
I haven't been on a personal trip.

20
00:00:43,907 --> 00:00:45,774
- I knew it. He's so busy. / - I see.

21
00:00:45,774 --> 00:00:46,907
What if...

22
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:48,207
You have a chance to go on a trip?

23
00:00:48,207 --> 00:00:49,340
- You get a break. / - Where would you go?

24
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:50,574
Let's say you have a week off.

25
00:00:50,574 --> 00:00:51,840
I used to work in Japan,

26
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,507
so I speak Japanese.

27
00:00:54,007 --> 00:00:56,207
- And I like hot springs. / - I see.

28
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:58,807
- So I want to go to Sapporo... / - For hot springs?

29
00:00:58,807 --> 00:01:02,074
And enjoy hot springs alone.

30
00:01:02,074 --> 00:01:04,107
Do you want to go to a hot spring alone?

31
00:01:04,107 --> 00:01:06,040
- He'd go with someone. / - Aren't you still young?

32
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:07,974
- Yes, I'm 24 years old. / - Wait.

33
00:01:07,974 --> 00:01:11,007
- It's like a trip for treatment. / - People of my age...

34
00:01:11,007 --> 00:01:12,840
- He's right. / - When you have joint problems.

35
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:14,640
He's been an idol for seven years.

36
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,707
I understand why he loves hot springs.

37
00:01:16,707 --> 00:01:17,740
He might have joint problems.

38
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:19,540
Who do you want to go with among your members?

39
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:22,374
- If I have to pick only 1... / - Just pick 1 person.

40
00:01:22,374 --> 00:01:23,540
I'll take Baekho.

41
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:24,540
- Baekho? / - Baekho.

42
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:25,840
Because he has a big build.

43
00:01:26,407 --> 00:01:27,807
I think he can protect me.

44
00:01:27,807 --> 00:01:28,840
As your bodyguard?

45
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:30,474
That's right. He'll be my bodyguard.

46
00:01:30,474 --> 00:01:33,240
It's strange to think of you two sitting in a hot spring.

47
00:01:34,474 --> 00:01:36,507
I'll tell you today's theme.

48
00:01:36,507 --> 00:01:39,307
Do you have a plan for your summer vacation?

49
00:01:39,307 --> 00:01:41,574
Summer vacation? Not yet.

50
00:01:41,574 --> 00:01:43,674
If you don't, you should watch this carefully.

51
00:01:43,674 --> 00:01:44,774
Today's theme is

52
00:01:44,774 --> 00:01:47,574
the emerging vacation spots of 2018.

53
00:01:47,574 --> 00:01:48,807
Oh, nice.

54
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,640
Emerging vacation spots.

55
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:52,907
I'm so excited to hear that.

56
00:01:52,907 --> 00:01:54,607
- Hear what? / - Emerging vacation spots.

57
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:57,407
It means people don't know about the places well.

58
00:01:57,407 --> 00:01:59,574
They're emerging as popular spots.

59
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:02,140
Let's meet the two teams who went on trips

60
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:03,574
to the emerging spots.

61
00:02:03,574 --> 00:02:06,140
Let's bring out the four trip designers.

62
00:02:09,174 --> 00:02:10,974
- Hello. / - Nice to meet you.

63
00:02:11,374 --> 00:02:14,140
- Hello. / - I'm glad to see you.

64
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:16,307
We have a model team...

65
00:02:16,307 --> 00:02:19,807
- And an actress team today. / - That's right.

66
00:02:19,807 --> 00:02:21,307
Let's find out their destinations then.

67
00:02:21,307 --> 00:02:23,640
Where did they go?

68
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:26,174
What are the emerging vacation spots of 2018?

69
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,674
- Please tell us. / - The place we went to...

70
00:02:28,674 --> 00:02:30,674
Is like Hawaii of the U.S.

71
00:02:30,674 --> 00:02:32,740
and Jeju-do of Korea.

72
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:34,874
This place is not that famous though.

73
00:02:34,874 --> 00:02:37,007
It's in Vietnam.

74
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:39,607
We went to Phu Quoc.

75
00:02:39,607 --> 00:02:40,707
It's Phu Quoc.

76
00:02:40,707 --> 00:02:42,874
- Phu Quoc? / - Phu Quoc.

77
00:02:42,874 --> 00:02:45,074
- Phu Quoc of Vietnam. / - Phu Quoc of Vietnam.

78
00:02:45,074 --> 00:02:47,440
- Phu Quoc? / - It must be popular.

79
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,407
- Where is it? / - I've heard of it before.

80
00:02:49,407 --> 00:02:53,774
It sounds like a butcher's shop.

81
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:56,107
- Right. / - Are you keeping us in check?

82
00:02:56,107 --> 00:02:57,474
They're criticizing already.

83
00:02:57,474 --> 00:02:59,307
Phu Quoc isn't well known in other countries

84
00:02:59,307 --> 00:03:02,640
but it's very popular among Vietnamese people.

85
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,707
During holiday seasons,

86
00:03:04,707 --> 00:03:08,140
it has a mass of local tourists.

87
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:09,940
- I can't wait to check it out. / - Me too.

88
00:03:10,174 --> 00:03:13,574
Where's the emerging vacation spot you went to?

89
00:03:13,574 --> 00:03:17,107
We went to Thailand.

90
00:03:17,107 --> 00:03:18,840
- Oh, no. / - We've been there a lot.

91
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:22,774
I know many people have been to Thailand.

92
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,674
So we went to a hidden place.

93
00:03:25,674 --> 00:03:27,474
Why do you think the place has been hidden?

94
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:29,740
- There must be a reason. / - Exactly.

95
00:03:30,007 --> 00:03:31,807
There must be a good reason.

96
00:03:32,207 --> 00:03:33,840
- Okay. / - Alright.

97
00:03:34,107 --> 00:03:36,674
You'd be surprised to see this place.

98
00:03:36,674 --> 00:03:39,074
- It's a hidden gem of Thailand. / - A hidden gem?

99
00:03:39,074 --> 00:03:40,307
It's...

100
00:03:40,374 --> 00:03:42,074
- Khao Yai. / - Khao Yai.

101
00:03:42,174 --> 00:03:43,474
- Khao Yai? / - It's Khao Yai.

102
00:03:43,474 --> 00:03:44,607
Khao Yai?

103
00:03:44,607 --> 00:03:46,140
It sounds like Japanese.

104
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:48,707
When you said Phu Quoc and Khao Yai,

105
00:03:48,707 --> 00:03:49,874
the audience was like this.

106
00:03:50,507 --> 00:03:52,007
(Where is it?)

107
00:03:52,007 --> 00:03:53,474
They're unfamiliar with these places.

108
00:03:53,474 --> 00:03:54,507
You know what?

109
00:03:54,507 --> 00:03:56,407
Traveling is all about pioneering.

110
00:03:56,407 --> 00:03:59,374
Those who travel to new places are the winners.

111
00:03:59,374 --> 00:04:01,340
Anyway, we're going to...

112
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:02,874
- Vietnam and Thailand today. / - Good.

113
00:04:02,874 --> 00:04:03,974
They are hidden vacation spots.

114
00:04:03,974 --> 00:04:06,774
If you take a photo of you watching Battle Trip

115
00:04:06,774 --> 00:04:08,507
and post it on your social media,

116
00:04:08,507 --> 00:04:09,974
We will select a few to give out Battle Trip books.

117
00:04:09,974 --> 00:04:11,374
We look forward to your participation.

118
00:04:11,374 --> 00:04:14,040
We have our 100 impartial judges

119
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:15,907
who will vote on today's trips.

120
00:04:15,907 --> 00:04:17,307
Welcome.

121
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:20,374
(The team with more votes will win the battle)

122
00:04:20,374 --> 00:04:22,074
Let's go to Vietnam first.

123
00:04:22,074 --> 00:04:23,340
- Phu Quoc? / - Yes, Phu Quoc.

124
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:24,474
I'm so curious.

125
00:04:24,474 --> 00:04:26,040
Alright then.

126
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:26,874
What's your team name?

127
00:04:26,874 --> 00:04:27,374
Do you have a team name?

128
00:04:27,374 --> 00:04:29,207
- We do. / - Yes, we do.

129
00:04:29,207 --> 00:04:31,607
You'll regret it if you don't leave

130
00:04:31,607 --> 00:04:33,774
for Phu Quoc now.

131
00:04:33,774 --> 00:04:35,507
- Song Vacation. / - Song Vacation.

132
00:04:35,507 --> 00:04:36,874
- Let's go! / - Let's go!

133
00:04:36,874 --> 00:04:38,640
(Song Vacation to Phu Quoc starts now)

134
00:04:40,574 --> 00:04:42,440
(10 days before the trip)

135
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:43,607
- Haena! / - Kyunga!

136
00:04:43,607 --> 00:04:45,440
- Long time no see. / - Kyunga.

137
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:49,307
- It's so good to see you again. / - Congratulations.

138
00:04:49,307 --> 00:04:51,540
You're going on a trip with me.

139
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:52,674
Really?

140
00:04:52,674 --> 00:04:55,907
(Leading Korean model, Song Kyunga)

141
00:04:55,907 --> 00:04:57,574
She looks so cool.

142
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:00,874
(She always has the aura of a model)

143
00:05:01,407 --> 00:05:03,707
(Bright and innocent)

144
00:05:03,707 --> 00:05:04,940
Models are so different.

145
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:06,140
What is this?

146
00:05:08,074 --> 00:05:11,707
It's all the stuff I hate.

147
00:05:12,174 --> 00:05:15,940
(You'll never get bored when you're with Kyunga)

148
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:20,140
(A popular model, Song Haena)

149
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,674
How cute!

150
00:05:23,907 --> 00:05:25,274
It's warm!

151
00:05:25,274 --> 00:05:28,007
It's so good!

152
00:05:28,774 --> 00:05:30,307
(Feeling happy)

153
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:37,174
(Song Haena, cheerful energizer)

154
00:05:37,707 --> 00:05:40,240
The theme of this trip is about

155
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,340
new vacation spots.

156
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:45,107
Actually, 12 years ago,

157
00:05:45,107 --> 00:05:46,474
I visited Vietnam.

158
00:05:46,474 --> 00:05:49,007
Vietnam is trending again these days.

159
00:05:49,007 --> 00:05:50,840
I have never been to Vietnam.

160
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:52,807
- I did bring a book on it though. / - Really?

161
00:05:52,807 --> 00:05:55,174
If it has to be a city that people haven't been before,

162
00:05:55,174 --> 00:05:57,874
it should be somewhere we haven't heard of.

163
00:05:57,874 --> 00:05:59,807
- Shouldn't there be a beach? / - I agree.

164
00:05:59,807 --> 00:06:00,807
Blue ocean.

165
00:06:00,807 --> 00:06:02,974
- There has to be a beach. / - Because it's summer.

166
00:06:02,974 --> 00:06:04,440
- That's a must for summer vacation. / - Right.

167
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:05,674
Let's see if there's an island.

168
00:06:05,674 --> 00:06:07,340
Let's see if there's a good place.

169
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:08,974
I found Cat Ba Island.

170
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:12,507
There's one more. Phu Quoc.

171
00:06:12,774 --> 00:06:15,507
I've never been there or heard about it. Phu Quoc?

172
00:06:15,507 --> 00:06:19,474
Phu Quoc isn't a place that

173
00:06:19,474 --> 00:06:21,040
a lot of people know about.

174
00:06:21,974 --> 00:06:23,740
- It suits the theme. / - Right.

175
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:25,174
I read the book and

176
00:06:25,174 --> 00:06:27,074
there were only 2 or 3 pages on it.

177
00:06:27,074 --> 00:06:28,240
That's amazing.

178
00:06:30,307 --> 00:06:31,907
- Look at the sky. / - Isn't it nice?

179
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:35,740
- Doesn't it look great? / - That looks so nice.

180
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:37,174
It's a vacation spot you must visit

181
00:06:37,174 --> 00:06:38,807
before it gets too popular.

182
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:43,707
(Phu Quoc)

183
00:06:43,707 --> 00:06:47,740
It has the largest man-made safari after Africa.

184
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:51,274
We'll take the longest cable car.

185
00:06:51,274 --> 00:06:53,407
(These top models showed up in Phu Quoc)

186
00:06:54,407 --> 00:06:57,207
- We need a photo of this. / - Let's take one.

187
00:06:57,207 --> 00:06:58,240
Does it fit?

188
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:01,774
(They dip their bodies in the beach)

189
00:07:01,774 --> 00:07:03,674
(And in the mud)

190
00:07:03,974 --> 00:07:04,974
This is so good.

191
00:07:05,174 --> 00:07:07,840
- It's better than the one in Korea. / - Come on.

192
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:11,674
- Look at that. / - That looks so good.

193
00:07:11,674 --> 00:07:13,907
(The food surpasses the usual)

194
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:18,740
It's so delicious!

195
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:20,107
- I'm hungry. / - Goodness.

196
00:07:20,107 --> 00:07:21,707
- Seriously. / - Look how empty it is.

197
00:07:22,207 --> 00:07:23,874
I think I would come back here.

198
00:07:23,874 --> 00:07:24,574
Me too.

199
00:07:24,574 --> 00:07:25,607
Right?

200
00:07:26,607 --> 00:07:30,374
(We invite you to charming Phu Quoc)

201
00:07:30,374 --> 00:07:33,574
So in other words...

202
00:07:33,574 --> 00:07:36,407
- We can travel for two days. / - Right.

203
00:07:36,407 --> 00:07:39,974
Let's make one as my day, and I'll plan the day.

204
00:07:39,974 --> 00:07:42,674
And the other day as your day.

205
00:07:42,674 --> 00:07:44,474
- I'd like that. / - Okay.

206
00:07:44,474 --> 00:07:46,640
Since you've been to a lot of vacation spots,

207
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:48,474
we can try out the activities

208
00:07:48,474 --> 00:07:51,074
at the vacation spot on your day.

209
00:07:51,074 --> 00:07:54,307
I'll plan what locals do on mine.

210
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:56,074
- I like that idea. / - With that theme.

211
00:07:56,074 --> 00:07:57,207
- I'll plan the day like that. / - I like that.

212
00:07:57,207 --> 00:08:00,874
But since this is a battle,

213
00:08:00,874 --> 00:08:02,607
don't we need a name for our team?

214
00:08:02,607 --> 00:08:03,807
What should our name be?

215
00:08:03,807 --> 00:08:05,174
Well...

216
00:08:05,174 --> 00:08:07,540
Do you have a name in mind?

217
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:09,774
- Since we're both Songs... / - Okay.

218
00:08:09,774 --> 00:08:12,640
I thought about naming it as Song Song Trip.

219
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:14,607
- Song Song Trip? / - Yes, I thought...

220
00:08:14,607 --> 00:08:15,874
That's too boring.

221
00:08:17,807 --> 00:08:18,840
She asked me if I had a name in mind,

222
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:19,774
and she rejected it.

223
00:08:19,774 --> 00:08:22,140
- You have to do it in one go. / - I told you.

224
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,340
(Song)

225
00:08:23,374 --> 00:08:24,607
Two Songs...

226
00:08:25,874 --> 00:08:28,207
Two Songs and Song Song are the same.

227
00:08:28,207 --> 00:08:29,607
How are they different?

228
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:32,207
- Song Song makes Two Songs. / - Or...

229
00:08:32,207 --> 00:08:36,674
This time, we're going on a trip to a vacation spot.

230
00:08:36,674 --> 00:08:37,340
Right.

231
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:40,874
Just like you suggested, we should use Song.

232
00:08:40,874 --> 00:08:43,740
- How about Song Vacation? / - That's cute.

233
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:45,674
- Song Vacation. Do you like it? / - Yes.

234
00:08:45,674 --> 00:08:48,740
Yes. Song Vacation. Yes!

235
00:08:53,607 --> 00:08:56,307
Song Vacation...

236
00:08:56,307 --> 00:08:57,707
- Let's go! / - Let's go!

237
00:09:01,607 --> 00:09:04,507
(3 days before the trip)

238
00:09:05,207 --> 00:09:08,240
I keep researching, but I can't find a lot of information.

239
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:13,674
Look at this. This is amazing.

240
00:09:13,674 --> 00:09:17,040
(The color of the beach in Phu Quoc stands out)

241
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,007
(A swing above the water)

242
00:09:18,007 --> 00:09:19,407
- That's Hawaii. / - I guess...

243
00:09:19,407 --> 00:09:22,707
Riding this swing must be quite famous there.

244
00:09:22,707 --> 00:09:23,874
Even if I don't research a lot,

245
00:09:23,874 --> 00:09:25,240
Haena will cover the rest, right?

246
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:28,174
I can just trust Haena.

247
00:09:31,174 --> 00:09:33,574
Our team went there on a direct flight.

248
00:09:33,574 --> 00:09:36,874
That's such a nice selling point.

249
00:09:36,874 --> 00:09:39,607
Since the airport was just built, it's really clean too.

250
00:09:39,607 --> 00:09:40,674
It's spotless.

251
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:44,107
It was around 11 p.m.

252
00:09:44,107 --> 00:09:45,907
- The airport was closing. / - It seems empty.

253
00:09:46,574 --> 00:09:49,374
So we have arrived. How will we get there?

254
00:09:50,074 --> 00:09:51,140
What? What is it?

255
00:09:52,307 --> 00:09:56,140
- It's thundering. / - It's thundering.

256
00:09:56,140 --> 00:09:59,040
- It's raining. / - The weather has to be good tomorrow.

257
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,440
- It will be. / - Right?

258
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:02,440
- It's my day tomorrow. / - That's right.

259
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:04,940
- Don't worry. / - It'll be your fault if it's not.

260
00:10:07,807 --> 00:10:10,474
(50 minutes to the hotel by taxi from the airport)

261
00:10:10,674 --> 00:10:11,740
(They arrive after 50 minutes)

262
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:14,174
- Haena, this is so nice. / - It's really nice.

263
00:10:14,174 --> 00:10:16,274
It's this one. 7236.

264
00:10:17,107 --> 00:10:18,107
Amazing.

265
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:21,340
This is nice.

266
00:10:21,707 --> 00:10:23,607
We should do our runway walk here.

267
00:10:24,307 --> 00:10:28,174
(It's a clean room just for the two of them)

268
00:10:30,607 --> 00:10:31,974
(Feeling excited)

269
00:10:31,974 --> 00:10:33,974
- I'm so excited. / - Are you happy, Haena?

270
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:36,340
I love it, Kyunga.

271
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:40,740
Tomorrow in Phu Quoc is my day which I planned.

272
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:43,340
Let's just pray that the weather is nice tomorrow.

273
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:45,440
- Yes. I got it. / - Okay.

274
00:10:45,807 --> 00:10:47,907
- Good night. / - Good night, Haena.

275
00:10:47,907 --> 00:10:49,774
I want to see the view during the day.

276
00:10:49,774 --> 00:10:52,240
- Aren't you curious? / - It's thundering.

277
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:56,774
(Morning dawns as they're worried and yet excited)

278
00:10:58,574 --> 00:11:00,307
(Luckily, the weather has cleared up)

279
00:11:00,307 --> 00:11:02,207
We had such great weather the next day.

280
00:11:03,407 --> 00:11:06,140
(Before their trip, they make a pit stop at this shop)

281
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,707
- It's so cute, isn't it? / - My gosh.

282
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:15,540
This shop looks more westernized than other shops.

283
00:11:19,407 --> 00:11:20,874
Look over here.

284
00:11:20,874 --> 00:11:23,574
We can find information on Phu Quoc.

285
00:11:23,574 --> 00:11:25,607
Let's have a look since we don't know much.

286
00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:28,674
There are maps here.

287
00:11:29,007 --> 00:11:30,707
Since not many people know this place,

288
00:11:30,707 --> 00:11:32,440
it has no information center.

289
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:34,740
So when you go to a famous cafe,

290
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:37,040
you can find information at a corner like that.

291
00:11:37,074 --> 00:11:39,574
We need this to get around today.

292
00:11:40,307 --> 00:11:43,007
Ta-da. You can find...

293
00:11:43,974 --> 00:11:45,740
Information on a board like this.

294
00:11:46,207 --> 00:11:47,540
This one is the map.

295
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:51,640
- Interesting. / - She can reach since she's tall.

296
00:11:51,974 --> 00:11:54,440
You should've dusted it too.

297
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:56,174
We don't need the Jimmy Jib.

298
00:11:57,674 --> 00:11:59,374
Information on traveling?

299
00:11:59,707 --> 00:12:01,474
This is an upside of being tall.

300
00:12:06,607 --> 00:12:09,640
Alright. Where should we go next?

301
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:11,240
(She checks the location with the map from the cafe)

302
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:13,507
Being in charge of the itinerary is a lot of pressure.

303
00:12:13,507 --> 00:12:16,407
Really? No, you came up with the itinerary.

304
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:20,440
All the good beaches are clustered here.

305
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:21,974
- Good beaches? / - Yes.

306
00:12:22,707 --> 00:12:23,974
Should we get going?

307
00:12:27,107 --> 00:12:29,440
(Phu Quoc with Song Vacation)

308
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:32,307
(Phu Quoc beaches)

309
00:12:34,107 --> 00:12:39,007
(20 minutes by taxi from cafe to the beach)

310
00:12:41,707 --> 00:12:43,407
(Long Beach)

311
00:12:43,407 --> 00:12:44,940
- Long Beach. / - Doesn't it look great?

312
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:47,074
- It's great. / - How beautiful.

313
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:50,040
- Is the water clean? / - It's super clean.

314
00:12:51,507 --> 00:12:53,074
The sand is really white there.

315
00:12:53,074 --> 00:12:55,574
- Look at the water. / - It was like a photo shoot.

316
00:12:57,807 --> 00:13:00,874
What do you think? I wanted to show you this beach.

317
00:13:00,874 --> 00:13:03,940
- First off, it's so beautiful. / - Right?

318
00:13:03,974 --> 00:13:06,940
It might be because this place isn't well-known...

319
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:09,840
- There aren't many people. / - The water is so clean.

320
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:11,440
- It's picturesque. / - Right.

321
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:15,240
Did you see the sand? The sand is so fine.

322
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:17,707
- Fine sand is rare in Vietnam. / - Really?

323
00:13:17,707 --> 00:13:20,374
Beautiful beaches like this are clustered

324
00:13:20,374 --> 00:13:21,507
on the Western side,

325
00:13:21,507 --> 00:13:23,740
so they're building a lot of hotels on this side.

326
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:25,374
And this beach is one of those beaches.

327
00:13:25,374 --> 00:13:28,640
This is a beach right in front of the hotel.

328
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:31,074
Then can people who don't stay

329
00:13:31,074 --> 00:13:32,574
at the hotel use this beach?

330
00:13:32,574 --> 00:13:34,407
Everyone can enjoy the beach for free.

331
00:13:34,407 --> 00:13:37,240
The hotel manages the beach...

332
00:13:37,407 --> 00:13:40,340
So it's known to be clean and well-managed.

333
00:13:42,474 --> 00:13:45,474
- Gosh, it's breezy. / - This is really beautiful.

334
00:13:47,374 --> 00:13:48,807
(Feeling excited)

335
00:13:48,807 --> 00:13:50,707
I feel like I can touch the clouds.

336
00:13:50,707 --> 00:13:52,240
They are hanging so low.

337
00:13:52,274 --> 00:13:54,407
Right. It feels like we can reach them, right?

338
00:13:56,274 --> 00:13:58,440
- It's great since it's quiet. / - It was so quiet.

339
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:00,807
- Later, it's going to get crowded. / - Exactly.

340
00:14:00,807 --> 00:14:03,607
- It'll be very stuffy. / - No one is at the beach.

341
00:14:03,607 --> 00:14:04,607
Right.

342
00:14:04,607 --> 00:14:07,574
- We ought to take a photo. / - We must.

343
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:11,640
There are 2 famous places where people take photos.

344
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:13,874
- 2 places? / - 1 of them is right here.

345
00:14:14,674 --> 00:14:15,674
A swing!

346
00:14:16,307 --> 00:14:18,340
You saw the swing on a beach in Phu Quoc

347
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:19,040
on social media.

348
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:20,874
- That's right! Yes, right! / - You've seen it, right?

349
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,640
- This is the place. / - It's so pretty.

350
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:24,607
I guess no one knows about this place.

351
00:14:24,607 --> 00:14:26,807
- Doesn't it look beautiful there? / - Yes, indeed.

352
00:14:27,107 --> 00:14:29,107
Wedding photos would look nice there too.

353
00:14:29,107 --> 00:14:31,840
- Wouldn't they look so beautiful? / - 1, 2, 3.

354
00:14:33,407 --> 00:14:34,807
- Gosh. / - Take my photo now.

355
00:14:35,507 --> 00:14:37,874
You look beautiful. Lie back.

356
00:14:37,874 --> 00:14:39,140
Hey!

357
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:40,507
- Lie back. / - Hey!

358
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:43,974
You did that on purpose. That was on purpose, right?

359
00:14:43,974 --> 00:14:47,574
- No, Kyunga. / - No! My hat!

360
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:49,507
(Screaming)

361
00:14:49,507 --> 00:14:50,574
That's leather!

362
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:55,974
(Everyone takes this kind of photo)

363
00:14:55,974 --> 00:14:58,340
(Right before her hat falls into the water)

364
00:14:58,340 --> 00:14:59,607
- Isn't it pretty? / - It's so beautiful.

365
00:14:59,607 --> 00:15:01,340
- What do we call that? / - A hammock.

366
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:03,007
I'm so jealous. I want to lie down there.

367
00:15:04,207 --> 00:15:07,207
- This looks so pretty. / - Amazing.

368
00:15:07,307 --> 00:15:09,340
- It's hard to lie on a hammock. / - Amazing. But...

369
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:10,540
- It's really sturdy. / - Gosh.

370
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:13,674
(Wow)

371
00:15:16,474 --> 00:15:18,807
- This is so much fun. / - You'll take the best photo.

372
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:23,540
(Exuding a model's aura)

373
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:25,174
She's very bold.

374
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:28,674
- It didn't flip. / - It doesn't flip.

375
00:15:29,674 --> 00:15:31,440
(She's indeed a model)

376
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:35,074
(A top model never sits in an ordinary way)

377
00:15:35,074 --> 00:15:36,307
You look gorgeous.

378
00:15:38,974 --> 00:15:41,574
Her legs look too long, don't they?

379
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:43,940
I know another beautiful spot.

380
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:46,607
- Is it a photo spot? / - Yes, I'll take you there.

381
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:49,340
It's a little far away.

382
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:51,374
- Is it? / - Yes. You're okay with it, right?

383
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:54,074
- Well, if it's for a photo... / - It's okay, right?

384
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:55,974
- Let's go then. / - Let's go.

385
00:15:55,974 --> 00:15:57,540
- Let's go. / - Where is it?

386
00:15:58,074 --> 00:16:03,307
(10 minutes by taxi from Hotel "N" to "S" Beach Club)

387
00:16:03,307 --> 00:16:05,140
- Where are we now? / - We're now...

388
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:07,774
- A beach club? / - Yes.

389
00:16:07,874 --> 00:16:09,974
This beach is full of interesting things.

390
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:12,774
We need to pay

391
00:16:12,774 --> 00:16:15,307
50,000 dong to get inside.

392
00:16:15,307 --> 00:16:17,574
- About $2.50? / - Yes.

393
00:16:17,574 --> 00:16:19,007
- It's cheap, right? / - It's cheap.

394
00:16:19,707 --> 00:16:22,440
Remove a zero and just divide the number by half.

395
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:24,940
- That's convenient. / - Just keep that in mind.

396
00:16:25,407 --> 00:16:26,674
(The entrance fee is about $2.50)

397
00:16:26,674 --> 00:16:29,807
(It includes a free drink coupon)

398
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:32,240
I feel like we're going to a club.

399
00:16:33,274 --> 00:16:34,907
Look! It's a shark!

400
00:16:35,007 --> 00:16:36,040
- A shark? / - Yes.

401
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:38,507
This place is really popular on social media.

402
00:16:39,507 --> 00:16:41,007
It's popular to take pictures with the sharks here.

403
00:16:41,007 --> 00:16:43,240
There are sharks and dolphins.

404
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:45,774
- There are elephants too. / - It's so pretty.

405
00:16:46,274 --> 00:16:48,574
My gosh, children will love this place.

406
00:16:48,574 --> 00:16:50,574
- This place is a great photo spot. / - It is.

407
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:54,874
(There are installation artworks from various artists)

408
00:16:54,874 --> 00:16:57,874
(On the beach so that tourists can take pictures there)

409
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:04,340
(It's already a famous place on social media)

410
00:17:04,340 --> 00:17:06,540
- Take a picture of me here. / - Okay.

411
00:17:06,974 --> 00:17:08,840
- Let me take pictures of you. / - It's so hot!

412
00:17:09,974 --> 00:17:11,907
It's like a photo shoot. You look amazing.

413
00:17:13,374 --> 00:17:15,640
(The sand is very hot now)

414
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:17,907
Because of the nice installation artworks,

415
00:17:17,907 --> 00:17:20,240
every photo looks nice even if you don't take it nicely.

416
00:17:20,307 --> 00:17:21,707
You can take pictures with the sharks too.

417
00:17:22,974 --> 00:17:25,174
(She's having a photo shoot again)

418
00:17:25,174 --> 00:17:27,640
The lighting is great, which makes the photos great.

419
00:17:28,307 --> 00:17:30,640
Since we have one free coupon...

420
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:32,807
- Shall we get something to drink? / - Shall we?

421
00:17:34,407 --> 00:17:36,074
(A glass of cold Vietnamese coffee to cool down)

422
00:17:36,074 --> 00:17:37,374
- That's it. / - That coffee was so delicious.

423
00:17:37,374 --> 00:17:40,007
- Vietnamese coffee is delicious. / - It was amazing.

424
00:17:40,274 --> 00:17:42,174
Vietnamese coffee is famous.

425
00:17:42,774 --> 00:17:45,707
(Sweet Vietnamese coffee to cool down the heat)

426
00:17:45,707 --> 00:17:47,507
Thank you.

427
00:17:49,674 --> 00:17:52,574
If you drink something sweet in a hot country...

428
00:17:52,574 --> 00:17:54,207
- It wakes you up. / - It does.

429
00:17:54,307 --> 00:17:55,474
Let's try it.

430
00:17:55,774 --> 00:17:57,907
(Sucking up)

431
00:17:57,907 --> 00:17:59,574
(How is it?)

432
00:17:59,574 --> 00:18:01,374
It tastes like a coffee flavored candy.

433
00:18:01,374 --> 00:18:03,707
- I loved those. / - It's like that candy but melted.

434
00:18:03,707 --> 00:18:04,907
- Really? / - Yes.

435
00:18:08,307 --> 00:18:09,440
It's like that, isn't it?

436
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:11,707
- It's delicious. / - This is so delicious.

437
00:18:15,107 --> 00:18:17,074
It'd be amazing

438
00:18:17,074 --> 00:18:19,540
to have a drink at sunset there.

439
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:21,640
- That sounds amazing. / - You wouldn't get drunk.

440
00:18:23,807 --> 00:18:26,574
Where do you think I'm taking you now?

441
00:18:27,074 --> 00:18:30,207
- I'm a little hungry. / - Right?

442
00:18:30,907 --> 00:18:32,740
There's a reason why I needed sugar.

443
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:33,907
Right?

444
00:18:34,074 --> 00:18:36,074
Before I came to Vietnam,

445
00:18:36,074 --> 00:18:38,607
what I wanted to try the most was banh xeo.

446
00:18:38,807 --> 00:18:40,874
I want to eat banh xeo.

447
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:44,540
It's like a pancake made with rice dough.

448
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:46,174
It's a wrap with ingredients in it.

449
00:18:46,174 --> 00:18:48,040
- Is it tasty? / - I heard it's very tasty.

450
00:18:49,107 --> 00:18:51,374
It's like wrapping with fried dough.

451
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:54,340
It's not like Korean fritters.

452
00:18:56,474 --> 00:19:00,807
(What would banh xeo taste like in south Vietnam?)

453
00:19:00,807 --> 00:19:02,407
My gosh, it looks delicious.

454
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:03,907
I'm hungry.

455
00:19:03,907 --> 00:19:06,774
We were hungry too, so we went to eat something.

456
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:12,907
(25 minutes by taxi from "S" Beach Club to restaurant)

457
00:19:12,907 --> 00:19:14,074
- Haena. / - Yes.

458
00:19:14,074 --> 00:19:17,307
The place we're going for lunch is

459
00:19:17,307 --> 00:19:18,974
a very famous place among the locals here.

460
00:19:18,974 --> 00:19:21,107
If you ask the taxi drivers here,

461
00:19:21,107 --> 00:19:23,674
everyone will tell you to go eat banh xeo there.

462
00:19:23,674 --> 00:19:26,474
- Is it this place? / - It's like a transport cafe.

463
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:29,007
It's the most popular place among the taxi drivers.

464
00:19:29,007 --> 00:19:31,407
There are a lot of people who have it takeaway.

465
00:19:31,407 --> 00:19:32,807
I can already feel that it'll be delicious.

466
00:19:32,807 --> 00:19:34,740
This must be a famous banh xeo restaurant.

467
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:37,807
- I love this kind of place. / - Right?

468
00:19:38,707 --> 00:19:41,974
(She's making banh xeo on the street)

469
00:19:45,874 --> 00:19:47,907
They put meat and other ingredients in.

470
00:19:48,607 --> 00:19:50,174
It was my first time trying it.

471
00:19:50,174 --> 00:19:51,474
- It was delicious. / - It's $1.

472
00:19:51,474 --> 00:19:53,374
- It's only a dollar. / - It was very delicious.

473
00:19:53,374 --> 00:19:55,374
I want to go there too.

474
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:57,340
It's so cheap.

475
00:19:58,607 --> 00:20:01,340
(A happiness you can buy with $1)

476
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:07,407
(Expectant)

477
00:20:07,407 --> 00:20:09,540
- What is this? / - It's banh xeo.

478
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:10,540
So this is banh xeo.

479
00:20:12,574 --> 00:20:13,940
What is this?

480
00:20:15,607 --> 00:20:18,007
- This is called nuoc mam. / - I see.

481
00:20:18,074 --> 00:20:21,307
It's like fish sauce in Korea.

482
00:20:21,307 --> 00:20:22,940
- I can smell fish. / - Right?

483
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:25,174
It's like anchovy sauce we use when

484
00:20:25,174 --> 00:20:26,807
we make kimchi.

485
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:30,207
Famous chefs from all over the world come here

486
00:20:30,207 --> 00:20:31,074
to buy this sauce.

487
00:20:31,074 --> 00:20:32,840
- They go all the way there? / - Yes.

488
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:34,807
I don't know how to eat this.

489
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:37,340
Just add whatever you'd like to eat on the lettuce.

490
00:20:37,907 --> 00:20:41,040
Then wrap it and dip it in the sauce.

491
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:45,007
It has vegetables in it.

492
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:52,374
(It's Haena's first Vietnamese dish)

493
00:20:52,374 --> 00:20:55,574
I can taste flour, corn and starch.

494
00:20:55,707 --> 00:20:57,340
I think they made the dough out of them.

495
00:20:57,340 --> 00:20:59,507
- It was very delicious. / - It was really good.

496
00:21:00,574 --> 00:21:01,407
It's like eating fritters but

497
00:21:01,407 --> 00:21:03,040
all the ingredients separately.

498
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:05,174
- It tastes like green onion fritters. / - It does.

499
00:21:05,174 --> 00:21:06,474
It's like seafood fritters.

500
00:21:08,307 --> 00:21:09,440
It's delicious.

501
00:21:10,474 --> 00:21:12,140
Nuoc mam is so tasty.

502
00:21:13,207 --> 00:21:16,940
The sauce puts all the flavors together.

503
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:19,674
- That's very delicious. / - It looks so delicious.

504
00:21:19,674 --> 00:21:20,907
(Everyone fell in love with banh xeo)

505
00:21:20,907 --> 00:21:22,874
Nuoc mam opened my eyes.

506
00:21:22,874 --> 00:21:23,974
It was so good.

507
00:21:25,074 --> 00:21:26,874
If we didn't have nuoc mam, it would've been bad.

508
00:21:27,307 --> 00:21:28,774
I want to try this one.

509
00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:31,107
This is made with coconut.

510
00:21:31,107 --> 00:21:34,107
It's like a coconut pancake.

511
00:21:34,107 --> 00:21:35,507
Does it have coconut inside?

512
00:21:35,507 --> 00:21:37,574
- That one was amazing. / - That was...

513
00:21:37,574 --> 00:21:39,040
That was incredible.

514
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:41,574
- It's only 10 cents. / - It's 10 cents.

515
00:21:41,574 --> 00:21:44,474
(One banh khot, about 10 cents)

516
00:21:48,174 --> 00:21:49,574
This one is really tasty.

517
00:21:55,174 --> 00:21:56,740
It has a texture I have never tried before.

518
00:21:57,807 --> 00:22:00,174
- It's like sticky rice. / - It is.

519
00:22:00,174 --> 00:22:03,374
- It was like sticky rice. / - It's so moist on the inside.

520
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:06,007
It doesn't have a strong coconut flavor.

521
00:22:06,007 --> 00:22:07,140
I can smell coconut a bit.

522
00:22:07,874 --> 00:22:10,240
I'd like to have 10 pieces of it.

523
00:22:10,274 --> 00:22:12,540
- I can eat 10 of those. / - 10 pieces would be easy.

524
00:22:14,407 --> 00:22:15,607
It's so tasty.

525
00:22:15,774 --> 00:22:18,807
I thought flour and vegetable won't go well together.

526
00:22:18,807 --> 00:22:20,940
- But they go very well together. / - They do.

527
00:22:24,907 --> 00:22:26,207
They seem to be truly enjoying it.

528
00:22:27,274 --> 00:22:30,040
(She looks like she would eat her own fingers)

529
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:33,940
We're eating so much, aren't we?

530
00:22:36,674 --> 00:22:41,240
(They enjoy the food fully)

531
00:22:42,374 --> 00:22:45,740
(Today, they won't worry about eating too much)

532
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:48,674
We paid $2.50 each.

533
00:22:48,674 --> 00:22:50,507
- Really? / - And we were so full in the end.

534
00:22:50,507 --> 00:22:52,407
Didn't you feel bad when you pay?

535
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:55,140
Where are we going now?

536
00:22:55,274 --> 00:22:56,640
- Now... / - Yes.

537
00:22:57,140 --> 00:22:59,607
- Let me explain with the map. / - Okay.

538
00:23:00,107 --> 00:23:02,140
We're now around here.

539
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:05,707
We're here, and we have to go there.

540
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:09,574
We're going to a spa now.

541
00:23:09,874 --> 00:23:11,207
- Spa? / - Yes.

542
00:23:11,907 --> 00:23:13,974
Spa? Go, go?

543
00:23:14,374 --> 00:23:15,674
Shall we get going?

544
00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:19,374
If there's a spa as well, I'd love to go there.

545
00:23:20,007 --> 00:23:22,774
It seems like we've won you over.

546
00:23:23,307 --> 00:23:25,374
I'm kind of attracted, yes.

547
00:23:25,374 --> 00:23:28,307
- You look convinced. / - I have to watch till the end.

548
00:23:30,674 --> 00:23:32,174
(They take a taxi to the mud spa)

549
00:23:32,174 --> 00:23:34,874
Let's go to the spa.

550
00:23:35,007 --> 00:23:36,107
Alright.

551
00:23:38,907 --> 00:23:41,107
- There's a taxi. / - Let's get this one.

552
00:23:42,574 --> 00:23:43,707
Taxi.

553
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:46,840
- The taxi looks so small. / - It's the cheapest taxi.

554
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:49,307
- The basic fee is 30 cents. / - Yes, it's 30 cents.

555
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,907
We'd like to go to the mud spa, please.

556
00:23:56,907 --> 00:23:59,374
It's fun to watch out the window from here.

557
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:02,774
We can see the downtown of Phu Quoc.

558
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:06,140
- Look over there. / - It's the port.

559
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:09,174
(There's a port and a beautiful sky next to city)

560
00:24:09,174 --> 00:24:10,840
It's so pretty.

561
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:13,807
This town is cute.

562
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:17,507
This town is not so developed,

563
00:24:17,507 --> 00:24:18,640
so I like it.

564
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,374
- It's so cute. / - It looks like a toy village.

565
00:24:21,707 --> 00:24:24,840
I feel like it'll be very different in five years from now.

566
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:25,774
You're right.

567
00:24:26,374 --> 00:24:30,040
There would be pros and cons.

568
00:24:30,107 --> 00:24:32,340
- It won't be like this then. / - No.

569
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:38,040
- We're almost there. / - We're almost there.

570
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:40,407
So it's a mud spa.

571
00:24:40,607 --> 00:24:42,040
Here we are.

572
00:24:42,674 --> 00:24:45,040
- We're here. / - Let's go.

573
00:24:45,974 --> 00:24:47,307
It looks pretty.

574
00:24:47,707 --> 00:24:49,707
It looks somewhat traditional.

575
00:24:49,707 --> 00:24:50,774
(What would the mud spa look like?)

576
00:24:54,174 --> 00:24:55,207
(There's a lot of open-air baths)

577
00:24:55,207 --> 00:24:56,940
What are they? Are they baths?

578
00:24:56,940 --> 00:25:00,040
- It's an open-air spa. / - So you can bathe there.

579
00:25:01,474 --> 00:25:03,340
It must be so hot to bathe outdoors.

580
00:25:03,340 --> 00:25:06,974
It wasn't that bad because of the shade from the trees.

581
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:10,074
There is a cool breeze from the beach as well.

582
00:25:12,340 --> 00:25:16,240
(One hour in the mud spa, about $22)

583
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:17,740
It's outside.

584
00:25:18,940 --> 00:25:20,240
It's a completely open place.

585
00:25:20,707 --> 00:25:22,140
People are bathing here.

586
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:25,374
Usually, the color of mud is black.

587
00:25:25,374 --> 00:25:26,240
But this one is light brown.

588
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:28,974
- I thought it'd be black. / - So did I.

589
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:34,974
- Do we just go in there? / - Do we?

590
00:25:35,107 --> 00:25:36,140
Can we just go in now?

591
00:25:37,807 --> 00:25:40,674
(The tub is empty but they go in for now)

592
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:42,307
Can we just stay in here?

593
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:45,907
(An employee comes over after they go into the tub)

594
00:25:47,874 --> 00:25:51,740
(The mud spills out)

595
00:25:53,274 --> 00:25:55,740
(Wow)

596
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:01,607
(It's a moisturizing mud spa)

597
00:26:01,607 --> 00:26:03,840
It's a mix of mud and mineral hot spring water.

598
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:04,907
I want to touch it.

599
00:26:05,307 --> 00:26:06,874
Don't drink it.

600
00:26:07,207 --> 00:26:08,374
(The mud feels very soft)

601
00:26:08,374 --> 00:26:10,140
- Look at this. / - It feels really nice, doesn't it?

602
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:15,640
I'm going to sit down.

603
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:22,007
It's warm.

604
00:26:22,474 --> 00:26:24,607
Kyunga. Kyunga.

605
00:26:24,740 --> 00:26:26,107
Can I splash you?

606
00:26:27,174 --> 00:26:28,207
This is interesting.

607
00:26:28,207 --> 00:26:29,474
(Take this)

608
00:26:29,474 --> 00:26:30,540
Kyunga.

609
00:26:31,507 --> 00:26:32,574
Kyunga.

610
00:26:36,574 --> 00:26:38,007
(The mud fills up the tub in no time)

611
00:26:38,007 --> 00:26:40,507
- They really fill it up. / - Exactly.

612
00:26:40,807 --> 00:26:43,074
- Kids will like it. / - It's good for families.

613
00:26:43,074 --> 00:26:44,840
Yes, it's perfect for families.

614
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:47,407
Doesn't the mud water look nice even from the clip?

615
00:26:48,874 --> 00:26:50,340
Whenever there's a breeze,

616
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:52,540
I can feel the coolness.

617
00:26:53,374 --> 00:26:55,240
Koreans, including myself...

618
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:57,507
- Like warm water and a hot bath. / - That's right.

619
00:26:57,507 --> 00:26:59,407
- It has to be warm. / - Right.

620
00:26:59,407 --> 00:27:01,074
We must heat up our bodies.

621
00:27:01,340 --> 00:27:03,007
- Then our fatigue washes away. / - I agree.

622
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:06,940
(This is how models enjoy warm mud)

623
00:27:08,007 --> 00:27:09,540
(Acting like they've fallen into a swamp)

624
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:10,640
Save me. Save me.

625
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:11,740
- They're weird. / - Save me.

626
00:27:11,907 --> 00:27:13,607
I feel like my skin is getting soft.

627
00:27:13,674 --> 00:27:14,774
Kyunga.

628
00:27:14,774 --> 00:27:15,940
(Massaging with the bucket)

629
00:27:16,074 --> 00:27:18,307
- Should I help you out? / - Namaste.

630
00:27:19,307 --> 00:27:21,140
- Kyunga. Is it your bikini? / - Yes?

631
00:27:23,907 --> 00:27:25,140
With this?

632
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:26,240
That's not cool.

633
00:27:27,907 --> 00:27:29,207
I'm getting sleepy.

634
00:27:31,274 --> 00:27:32,574
- Kyunga. / - I might fall asleep.

635
00:27:33,307 --> 00:27:35,640
Don't fall asleep.

636
00:27:36,574 --> 00:27:37,707
That must've been nice.

637
00:27:39,207 --> 00:27:41,907
- After the spa, our skin got really soft. / - Right.

638
00:27:41,907 --> 00:27:47,174
(They leisurely enjoy the spa)

639
00:27:51,374 --> 00:27:53,707
- Haena. There's... / - Yes?

640
00:27:54,007 --> 00:27:56,507
An important highlight on my itinerary.

641
00:27:56,974 --> 00:27:58,207
When we were on the taxi, I said...

642
00:27:58,207 --> 00:28:00,674
- We're going to a night market. / - Oh, right.

643
00:28:00,674 --> 00:28:02,207
That's where we'll go at night.

644
00:28:02,274 --> 00:28:03,774
- That's going to be a blast. / - Right.

645
00:28:03,907 --> 00:28:06,207
- Let's dress up nicely... / - Okay.

646
00:28:06,207 --> 00:28:08,074
- And head to the night market. / - Okay.

647
00:28:08,074 --> 00:28:10,307
- Dress sexy. / - I'll eat delicious food.

648
00:28:10,307 --> 00:28:12,840
Let's take a tour around the night market.

649
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:14,674
Should we get going now?

650
00:28:16,174 --> 00:28:19,974
(They must hurry to the market)

651
00:28:19,974 --> 00:28:21,374
(Screaming)

652
00:28:21,507 --> 00:28:22,540
- What? / - What is it?

653
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:28,007
- What is that? / - Is that how you clean the mud?

654
00:28:28,007 --> 00:28:29,440
- It's like a car wash. / - Yes.

655
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:31,907
(She strikes a pose in the midst of this)

656
00:28:35,174 --> 00:28:37,474
Gosh, models are different from us indeed.

657
00:28:37,474 --> 00:28:40,207
(This is how top models wash off the mud)

658
00:28:42,807 --> 00:28:44,674
- Ta-da. / - When you spin, it washes off.

659
00:28:44,674 --> 00:28:46,807
But if I do that, it'd wash off my makeup.

660
00:28:47,540 --> 00:28:49,107
It will clean the top of my head too.

661
00:28:49,107 --> 00:28:50,307
You're right.

662
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:53,340
(10 minutes from the spa to the night market)

663
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:54,374
Night markets are fun.

664
00:28:54,374 --> 00:28:55,507
- You must visit the market. / - It's so much fun.

665
00:28:55,507 --> 00:28:56,574
You must.

666
00:28:56,574 --> 00:29:00,174
(Quirky Kyunga's day is coming to an end)

667
00:29:00,174 --> 00:29:01,574
- Haena. / - Kyunga.

668
00:29:01,574 --> 00:29:03,674
This is the highlight of my itinerary.

669
00:29:03,774 --> 00:29:06,040
- This place is so beautiful. / - Phu Quoc's...

670
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:07,440
Night market.

671
00:29:09,874 --> 00:29:13,507
(An 800m night market visited by locals and tourists)

672
00:29:13,507 --> 00:29:14,840
800m long?

673
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:17,407
- It's really long. / - It was empty in the afternoon.

674
00:29:17,407 --> 00:29:19,107
- Everyone came here at night. / - Right.

675
00:29:19,107 --> 00:29:20,340
This place is packed.

676
00:29:21,507 --> 00:29:23,507
- What's that? / - Is that takoyaki?

677
00:29:25,007 --> 00:29:28,540
(The most famous food from the night market)

678
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:30,974
(It's fresh seafood)

679
00:29:30,974 --> 00:29:32,440
- Seafood? / - Yes.

680
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:35,640
Since it's an island, it's fresh.

681
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:38,440
- I'm jealous about the seafood. / - Yes.

682
00:29:39,874 --> 00:29:41,107
Peanuts. Free to try.

683
00:29:41,107 --> 00:29:42,274
- Peanuts? / - Yum, yum.

684
00:29:42,474 --> 00:29:43,574
Yum, yum.

685
00:29:43,574 --> 00:29:44,940
- Peanuts? / - Peanuts.

686
00:29:45,507 --> 00:29:46,674
Peanuts.

687
00:29:48,607 --> 00:29:50,007
Gosh, peanuts.

688
00:29:50,707 --> 00:29:52,507
- He can speak Korean. / - Yes, he speaks Korean.

689
00:29:52,774 --> 00:29:54,674
A lot of stalls sold peanuts.

690
00:29:55,807 --> 00:29:57,074
And look at this one.

691
00:29:57,074 --> 00:29:59,507
I heard that Vietnamese pearls are famous here.

692
00:29:59,507 --> 00:30:02,607
- Really? / - Everyone buys pearls here and...

693
00:30:02,607 --> 00:30:04,674
Manufactures them and sells them at high prices.

694
00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:07,007
- They're famous for peppers? / - Yes.

695
00:30:07,574 --> 00:30:10,340
World-famous chefs personally come here...

696
00:30:10,340 --> 00:30:11,974
- And buy peppers here. / - Really?

697
00:30:11,974 --> 00:30:13,074
You have to buy it then.

698
00:30:13,340 --> 00:30:15,040
You have to grind the peppers, right?

699
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:16,140
- Yes. Yes. / - Like a cool chef?

700
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:17,474
This one is the white pepper.

701
00:30:17,474 --> 00:30:19,440
- This one is the black pepper. / - Black pepper.

702
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:22,574
Should I buy white peppers?

703
00:30:22,574 --> 00:30:23,540
They're hard to come by.

704
00:30:23,674 --> 00:30:27,374
(What has caught their attention?)

705
00:30:27,807 --> 00:30:28,807
It's real pepper.

706
00:30:28,974 --> 00:30:30,740
- I've never seen pepper leaves. / - This...

707
00:30:30,740 --> 00:30:31,874
It's my first time too.

708
00:30:31,974 --> 00:30:33,674
- Gosh. / - I never knew it looked like this.

709
00:30:33,674 --> 00:30:35,874
- This is the pepper. / - That's the pepper fruit.

710
00:30:37,007 --> 00:30:39,007
- It was my first time. / - How do you eat that?

711
00:30:39,174 --> 00:30:40,207
Can I touch it?

712
00:30:40,207 --> 00:30:43,307
(She carefully touches the fruit)

713
00:30:45,274 --> 00:30:46,574
I don't smell anything.

714
00:30:46,774 --> 00:30:47,940
It doesn't smell.

715
00:30:48,007 --> 00:30:49,240
How can I taste this?

716
00:30:51,174 --> 00:30:52,240
Should I just eat it?

717
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:54,007
(They taste the pepper fruit after the peanuts)

718
00:30:56,574 --> 00:30:58,640
- It's spicy. / - I thought my tongue was on fire.

719
00:30:59,074 --> 00:31:00,240
I thought I was a fire breathing dragon.

720
00:31:00,807 --> 00:31:01,874
It's spicy.

721
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:03,940
It's spicy.

722
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:09,274
- It's so spicy. / - No.

723
00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:11,240
- It's so spicy. / - It's so spicy.

724
00:31:13,574 --> 00:31:16,174
It's a different kind of spicy from chili peppers.

725
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:18,040
My mouth is numb.

726
00:31:18,407 --> 00:31:20,340
It's like we tasted fire, right?

727
00:31:20,340 --> 00:31:23,574
(Don't try pepper fruit without preparing yourselves)

728
00:31:24,374 --> 00:31:27,040
- Should we eat something? / - What should we eat?

729
00:31:27,140 --> 00:31:28,774
Do you want to try this? Can you eat it?

730
00:31:29,474 --> 00:31:31,140
Chicken, one.

731
00:31:31,574 --> 00:31:33,207
There are so many skewers.

732
00:31:34,874 --> 00:31:36,974
(Shrimp skewer $1, chicken skewer $2)

733
00:31:36,974 --> 00:31:39,840
- Gosh, they are $1 and $2. / - $1 and $2.

734
00:31:40,507 --> 00:31:43,940
(Munching)

735
00:31:44,007 --> 00:31:45,007
It's so good.

736
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:48,040
But since it's salty...

737
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:51,707
I think they seasoned it with a lot of salt and pepper.

738
00:31:53,374 --> 00:31:58,607
(Coconut juice, $1.20)

739
00:31:58,607 --> 00:31:59,707
It's good.

740
00:32:01,174 --> 00:32:02,307
There's squid.

741
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:03,574
The squid looks delicious.

742
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:05,040
(Grilled squid with spicy sauce)

743
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:06,107
It looks so delicious.

744
00:32:06,374 --> 00:32:08,374
The fish are huge. Amazing.

745
00:32:08,407 --> 00:32:11,840
I guess seafood is famous here.

746
00:32:11,907 --> 00:32:13,340
Should we eat seafood tonight?

747
00:32:13,340 --> 00:32:15,040
Come on. Eat something already.

748
00:32:15,340 --> 00:32:17,674
(They decide on the seafood as their last meal)

749
00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:19,807
- Gosh, why is this so big? / - This one is huge.

750
00:32:21,107 --> 00:32:23,707
(Massive black tiger prawns catch their eyes first)

751
00:32:23,707 --> 00:32:25,707
Haena, when you come to Phu Quoc,

752
00:32:25,707 --> 00:32:28,007
you must at least try one of these.

753
00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:29,274
Really?

754
00:32:29,274 --> 00:32:31,707
(Dinner consists of sea urchins, must-try food)

755
00:32:31,707 --> 00:32:34,674
(Black tiger prawns)

756
00:32:34,674 --> 00:32:38,574
(And fresh squids)

757
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:40,074
I hope it comes out quickly.

758
00:32:40,274 --> 00:32:42,474
(I hope so too)

759
00:32:42,874 --> 00:32:43,874
Here it comes.

760
00:32:46,707 --> 00:32:48,407
This is the highlight of today.

761
00:32:52,807 --> 00:32:55,974
(Sea urchin, $1.50 each)

762
00:32:55,974 --> 00:32:58,074
(Squid, $3 each)

763
00:32:58,074 --> 00:33:00,607
(400g of black tiger prawns, $20)

764
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:01,640
The prawn is so big.

765
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:03,274
- It's good. / - Gosh.

766
00:33:03,274 --> 00:33:05,140
- It's like lobster. / - Isn't that a prawn burger?

767
00:33:05,874 --> 00:33:06,940
Why is it so big?

768
00:33:07,107 --> 00:33:09,340
(400g of black tiger prawns, $20)

769
00:33:09,507 --> 00:33:12,240
(The whole meal costs $24.50)

770
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:15,107
It's convenient to eat there.

771
00:33:15,107 --> 00:33:20,007
(Kyunga's first choice is the squid)

772
00:33:20,007 --> 00:33:21,640
- Squid. / - Squid.

773
00:33:22,974 --> 00:33:24,240
That must be delicious.

774
00:33:24,907 --> 00:33:28,074
(The squid seems extra fresh. How would it taste?)

775
00:33:29,474 --> 00:33:30,807
Try the squid.

776
00:33:30,940 --> 00:33:32,340
- Which one should I dip it into? / - It's so savory.

777
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:37,540
Isn't it tasty?

778
00:33:38,107 --> 00:33:39,374
The squid is delicious.

779
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:41,507
Here's the interesting point.

780
00:33:41,507 --> 00:33:44,940
They didn't gut the squid before serving us.

781
00:33:45,174 --> 00:33:47,074
But the innards taste really good.

782
00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:48,840
- You ate the innards? / - Yes.

783
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:50,974
- Those are the tasty parts. / - Really? I haven't tried.

784
00:33:51,007 --> 00:33:52,240
Should I try the sea urchin?

785
00:33:52,374 --> 00:33:54,407
- I'm not good at eating these. / - Me neither.

786
00:33:54,407 --> 00:33:55,607
Sea urchins look delicious.

787
00:33:55,874 --> 00:34:00,540
(This is the sea urchin that we know of)

788
00:34:01,607 --> 00:34:03,140
(However, it looks slightly different)

789
00:34:03,140 --> 00:34:04,540
- That looks interesting. / - There are peanuts inside.

790
00:34:04,540 --> 00:34:05,640
- What's that? / - Right.

791
00:34:06,407 --> 00:34:07,507
There are peanuts.

792
00:34:07,874 --> 00:34:10,407
- I never had peanuts with seafood. / - Me neither.

793
00:34:10,507 --> 00:34:12,074
This is a new combination.

794
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:21,307
(A bite with peanuts)

795
00:34:22,674 --> 00:34:23,774
(How does it taste?)

796
00:34:24,340 --> 00:34:26,874
- It's not fishy at all. / - I find that intriguing.

797
00:34:27,707 --> 00:34:29,974
- It's not fishy at all. / - I don't eat this because it's fishy.

798
00:34:29,974 --> 00:34:32,340
Me neither. I don't like the fishy smell.

799
00:34:32,774 --> 00:34:34,140
But it's not fishy at all.

800
00:34:34,207 --> 00:34:36,307
They did season the sea urchin

801
00:34:36,307 --> 00:34:37,940
but I can still taste its unique flavor.

802
00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:41,274
I think people who can't eat sea urchins can eat this.

803
00:34:41,274 --> 00:34:42,940
- Don't you think so? / - I agree.

804
00:34:45,807 --> 00:34:48,574
- I want to try this one. / - Yes, let's try that one too.

805
00:34:48,940 --> 00:34:50,107
It's huge.

806
00:34:50,474 --> 00:34:53,007
When would we have a chance to eat this if not here?

807
00:34:54,974 --> 00:34:57,874
(The prawn seems massive even at a glance)

808
00:34:57,874 --> 00:34:59,874
- It's full of roe. This is amazing. / - My gosh.

809
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:03,274
(Impressed)

810
00:35:03,274 --> 00:35:04,374
Isn't that huge?

811
00:35:05,107 --> 00:35:07,440
That was the best out of all.

812
00:35:08,307 --> 00:35:09,340
Hey, they make a heart.

813
00:35:09,407 --> 00:35:10,407
- A heart. / - A heart.

814
00:35:10,407 --> 00:35:11,474
A heart.

815
00:35:11,474 --> 00:35:13,674
(The huge prawns totally excite them)

816
00:35:14,874 --> 00:35:16,140
What's this?

817
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:17,140
Where's the red pepper paste with vinegar?

818
00:35:17,940 --> 00:35:19,574
- Where is it? / - So Korean.

819
00:35:19,574 --> 00:35:21,174
(How does the prawn taste?)

820
00:35:21,174 --> 00:35:23,007
You need red pepper paste with vinegar to eat prawns.

821
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:27,040
(Her face tells how delicious it is)

822
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:28,107
This is it.

823
00:35:28,874 --> 00:35:32,807
This is how we should end the day.

824
00:35:34,407 --> 00:35:35,674
Oh, my God.

825
00:35:35,674 --> 00:35:38,140
- She looks so happy. / - It was really good.

826
00:35:38,140 --> 00:35:39,507
It must have been really delicious.

827
00:35:39,807 --> 00:35:41,040
This is it.

828
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:43,674
There's something creamy on top.

829
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:45,207
It's the prawn's brain.

830
00:35:45,207 --> 00:35:46,640
- Prawn's brain? / - Yes.

831
00:35:47,140 --> 00:35:49,307
- I thought it was cream. / - This is so delicious.

832
00:35:49,307 --> 00:35:50,440
It's so tender.

833
00:35:50,474 --> 00:35:54,340
There was something creamy and soft inside.

834
00:35:54,340 --> 00:35:55,874
- It was so delicious. / - It was so good.

835
00:35:55,874 --> 00:35:57,274
(The creamy texture makes the prawns even tastier)

836
00:35:58,140 --> 00:35:59,374
Shall we have a drink?

837
00:36:00,774 --> 00:36:01,640
Good job today.

838
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:04,940
- I'll wrap up my tour with this. / - Good work.

839
00:36:04,940 --> 00:36:06,774
I'm looking forward to your day tomorrow.

840
00:36:06,774 --> 00:36:07,807
(I'm looking forward to Haena's day)

841
00:36:09,074 --> 00:36:13,074
(Seafood dish and refreshing beer)

842
00:36:18,407 --> 00:36:20,907
Excuse me, but there's something on your lips.

843
00:36:21,474 --> 00:36:22,340
Kyunga.

844
00:36:22,340 --> 00:36:24,507
- She's so happy. / - I don't think you realized that.

845
00:36:29,674 --> 00:36:33,774
It's so nice. Kyunga, you're not drunk, are you?

846
00:36:33,774 --> 00:36:35,940
Your face is already red.

847
00:36:37,074 --> 00:36:38,240
I'm fine.

848
00:36:39,607 --> 00:36:41,140
What about your diet?

849
00:36:41,740 --> 00:36:44,740
I don't know. I think I will gain weight.

850
00:36:45,507 --> 00:36:46,840
Seriously, I stuffed myself.

851
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:52,040
She's almost cramming the food into her mouth.

852
00:36:53,907 --> 00:36:57,840
Today, you introduced me to the places...

853
00:36:58,274 --> 00:36:59,640
Where I could relaxed.

854
00:37:00,474 --> 00:37:04,507
Tomorrow, I'm going to bother you a bit.

855
00:37:05,374 --> 00:37:09,607
Why? I'm even treating you such a great prawn dish.

856
00:37:09,974 --> 00:37:11,774
Why would you do that to me?

857
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:13,274
It's a different kind of trip.

858
00:37:13,274 --> 00:37:14,940
(It's going to be a different kind of relaxing trip)

859
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:16,940
Tomorrow...

860
00:37:19,374 --> 00:37:20,640
I might not come out.

861
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:24,307
- Kyunga. / - I have a feeling already.

862
00:37:24,307 --> 00:37:25,940
- I have a bad feeling. / - I will wake you up.

863
00:37:25,940 --> 00:37:27,440
The night market looks nice.

864
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:29,040
- It was really nice. / - We had so much fun.

865
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:30,940
(Phu Quoc, a beautiful hidden island)

866
00:37:30,940 --> 00:37:32,540
(With Song Vacation)

867
00:37:32,540 --> 00:37:34,440
(Does Phu Quoc look like a typical vacation spot?)

868
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:35,707
(It's actually very different)

869
00:37:35,707 --> 00:37:37,340
(The real trip begins now)

870
00:37:38,007 --> 00:37:40,340
(The longest cable car in the world)

871
00:37:40,574 --> 00:37:41,507
This was amazing too.

872
00:37:41,507 --> 00:37:43,440
The world's longest cable car.

873
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:45,507
And this is the biggest safari in Asia.

874
00:37:45,507 --> 00:37:47,307
It's a world-class place.

875
00:37:47,307 --> 00:37:48,774
We must eat this.

876
00:37:48,774 --> 00:37:51,407
(World-class dishes)

877
00:37:51,674 --> 00:37:53,240
(World-class attractions)

878
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:55,274
- Look at that. / - It's so cute.

879
00:37:55,274 --> 00:37:56,540
- It's a raccoon. / - It's so cute.

880
00:37:56,540 --> 00:37:58,407
(World-class fun)

881
00:37:58,807 --> 00:38:01,007
Would you like some mojito in Phu Quoc?

882
00:38:01,874 --> 00:38:03,974
- That's the next day, right? / - Yes.

883
00:38:03,974 --> 00:38:06,007
- It's Haena's day. / - Haena's day.

884
00:38:06,007 --> 00:38:09,674
(Phu Quoc with Song Vacation)

885
00:38:09,674 --> 00:38:12,340
- You shouldn't miss pho. / - You really shouldn't.

886
00:38:12,340 --> 00:38:15,007
- Pho. / - It's southern Vietnamese noodles.

887
00:38:15,007 --> 00:38:17,207
- Is it different? / - It's different from other pho.

888
00:38:17,374 --> 00:38:18,640
- Really? / - Yes.

889
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:19,807
- Haena. / - Yes.

890
00:38:19,807 --> 00:38:22,474
- The weather is so nice today. / - It is.

891
00:38:22,474 --> 00:38:24,807
So this is the beginning of Haena's day.

892
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:26,507
Where are we going?

893
00:38:27,340 --> 00:38:30,874
You said you'd like to eat...

894
00:38:30,907 --> 00:38:34,074
Vietnamese pho for breakfast.

895
00:38:34,074 --> 00:38:37,074
- Yes. / - So we're going to eat...

896
00:38:37,407 --> 00:38:39,807
Southern Vietnamese pho.

897
00:38:39,874 --> 00:38:43,407
The noodles just melt.

898
00:38:43,407 --> 00:38:46,974
(Hanoi)

899
00:38:46,974 --> 00:38:48,407
- That's pho. / - We tried many kinds of noodles.

900
00:38:48,407 --> 00:38:50,674
- We know what they taste like. / - Nha Trang.

901
00:38:50,940 --> 00:38:52,807
- Nha Trang. / - Nha Trang.

902
00:38:52,807 --> 00:38:55,007
I was really jealous when they went to Nha Trang.

903
00:38:55,074 --> 00:38:57,774
I heard Park Jungsoo really loved it.

904
00:38:57,807 --> 00:39:03,974
(Pho)

905
00:39:04,540 --> 00:39:06,040
Are we now going to see pho from Phu Quoc?

906
00:39:06,074 --> 00:39:07,774
- It's very different. / - It's so different.

907
00:39:07,774 --> 00:39:10,740
(It's a new type of pho dish)

908
00:39:12,340 --> 00:39:13,874
The noodles are very thin.

909
00:39:14,540 --> 00:39:16,607
It's similar to banquet noodles in Korea.

910
00:39:16,707 --> 00:39:18,174
I already want to eat it.

911
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:22,207
(After cooking the noodles in the hot water)

912
00:39:22,207 --> 00:39:26,274
You can order one with both meat and seafood in it

913
00:39:26,274 --> 00:39:28,474
or one with either of them.

914
00:39:28,674 --> 00:39:31,774
It's southern style, so it's a little different.

915
00:39:32,874 --> 00:39:34,707
It looks so delicious.

916
00:39:34,707 --> 00:39:35,874
That has to be delicious.

917
00:39:35,874 --> 00:39:37,707
- It has prawn in it. / - It's really good.

918
00:39:37,807 --> 00:39:40,240
They put seafood and meat in the broth.

919
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:41,907
It doesn't look that different from ordinary pho though.

920
00:39:41,907 --> 00:39:44,907
As we said, Phu Quoc is close to Cambodia.

921
00:39:44,907 --> 00:39:49,640
So it originated from southern Cambodian dish

922
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:52,507
and it's now become a Phu Quoc style dish.

923
00:39:54,807 --> 00:39:57,007
Have you tried pho in Vietnam?

924
00:39:57,140 --> 00:39:59,540
- Yes, I have. In Hanoi. / - Really?

925
00:39:59,540 --> 00:40:01,074
- In Hanoi? / - Yes.

926
00:40:01,074 --> 00:40:02,774
This is my first time in Vietnam

927
00:40:02,774 --> 00:40:05,540
and this is also my first pho in Vietnam.

928
00:40:05,907 --> 00:40:07,040
I'm looking forward to it.

929
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:08,040
- Really? / - Yes.

930
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:10,140
We just ordered hu tieu.

931
00:40:10,140 --> 00:40:13,007
I've never heard of this either. I'm so curious.

932
00:40:13,007 --> 00:40:16,440
Is pho we eat in Korea northern style pho?

933
00:40:16,474 --> 00:40:18,607
- It's Hanoi-style pho. / - Hanoi? I see.

934
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:22,574
- It has meat in it. / - It has beef brisket in it.

935
00:40:22,574 --> 00:40:23,840
You're right.

936
00:40:24,007 --> 00:40:25,807
- So... / - It's here!

937
00:40:25,974 --> 00:40:27,940
- Here's your pho. / - Thank you so much.

938
00:40:27,940 --> 00:40:30,207
This is yours. Here you are.

939
00:40:30,207 --> 00:40:31,274
(Hu tieu, $3.40)

940
00:40:31,274 --> 00:40:32,274
First of all...

941
00:40:34,207 --> 00:40:36,974
Goodness, it looks really delicious. Look at it.

942
00:40:37,374 --> 00:40:40,274
(Sniffing)

943
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:41,840
Doesn't it smell very familiar?

944
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:43,274
Yes, I smelled this in Korea.

945
00:40:43,274 --> 00:40:44,640
This is a common smell in Korean food.

946
00:40:45,174 --> 00:40:46,440
You sound disappointed.

947
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:47,907
Is it because it smelled similar to Korean dishes?

948
00:40:47,907 --> 00:40:49,574
- Yes. / - The broth is...

949
00:40:49,574 --> 00:40:52,240
- The broth is made with meat. / - Meat broth.

950
00:40:53,174 --> 00:40:57,874
The noodles are much thinner than ordinary pho.

951
00:40:58,374 --> 00:41:00,540
- It's like thin noodles. / - It's very thin, isn't it?

952
00:41:00,540 --> 00:41:02,874
But it's very chewy.

953
00:41:02,940 --> 00:41:05,640
Isn't it usually flat?

954
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:07,540
- That's right. / - It's usually thick.

955
00:41:07,540 --> 00:41:10,874
It looks and smells like banquet noodles.

956
00:41:11,174 --> 00:41:12,907
- Is the noodle made of rice? / - Yes.

957
00:41:12,907 --> 00:41:15,740
(Slurping)

958
00:41:17,107 --> 00:41:18,240
It's so chewy.

959
00:41:20,007 --> 00:41:22,274
It has a very chewy texture.

960
00:41:23,607 --> 00:41:24,674
Doesn't it?

961
00:41:25,740 --> 00:41:28,607
It's like half glass noodle and half rice noodle.

962
00:41:29,274 --> 00:41:30,540
- Isn't it? / - It is.

963
00:41:30,574 --> 00:41:32,474
And the noodle has a unique texture.

964
00:41:32,474 --> 00:41:34,740
It's fresh noodles, right? Isn't it fresh noodles?

965
00:41:34,874 --> 00:41:37,407
- It's dried noodles. / - It's homemade dried noodles.

966
00:41:37,774 --> 00:41:39,507
I don't know if the sweet flavor is coming

967
00:41:39,507 --> 00:41:40,807
from the shrimp or the squid

968
00:41:40,807 --> 00:41:42,307
but it tastes very sweet.

969
00:41:42,307 --> 00:41:44,607
You can choose the broth as well.

970
00:41:44,774 --> 00:41:47,140
- Meat broth, seafood broth... / - Seafood broth.

971
00:41:47,140 --> 00:41:49,174
You can have it mixed too.

972
00:41:49,174 --> 00:41:50,807
It could have been too bland

973
00:41:50,807 --> 00:41:52,174
without some spicy sauce.

974
00:41:52,174 --> 00:41:53,274
You're right.

975
00:41:53,307 --> 00:41:57,174
But it's already savory without any sauce added.

976
00:41:57,174 --> 00:41:59,974
In the southern region, they use a lot of vegetables,

977
00:41:59,974 --> 00:42:01,874
which makes the broth very sweet.

978
00:42:02,907 --> 00:42:06,307
(They start to dig in)

979
00:42:06,307 --> 00:42:08,074
- Look at the meat. / - That's a big chunk of meat.

980
00:42:08,074 --> 00:42:09,474
The meat is so tender.

981
00:42:09,807 --> 00:42:12,440
(There is a generous amount of meat)

982
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:13,940
It looks delicious.

983
00:42:14,540 --> 00:42:16,774
Eunhye, you've become very quiet.

984
00:42:17,540 --> 00:42:20,407
We have something to show also.

985
00:42:20,407 --> 00:42:21,940
Do you? I see.

986
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:25,274
Haena, I think I'll be quite full after finishing this bowl.

987
00:42:25,307 --> 00:42:28,507
It's a hearty dish, isn't it?

988
00:42:28,507 --> 00:42:29,907
Even though it's just noodles.

989
00:42:30,007 --> 00:42:32,374
Why do you feed me such a heavy dish?

990
00:42:32,907 --> 00:42:34,840
(She winces)

991
00:42:34,907 --> 00:42:36,640
Why do you keep trying to feed me so much?

992
00:42:37,107 --> 00:42:38,374
You need to eat a lot.

993
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:39,840
- Do I? / - Yes.

994
00:42:40,407 --> 00:42:41,640
Alright.

995
00:42:41,940 --> 00:42:44,940
- To Haena's day. / - Cheers.

996
00:42:44,940 --> 00:42:46,740
- Please look forward to it. / - I will.

997
00:42:47,474 --> 00:42:50,607
(Phu Quoc with Song Vacation)

998
00:42:50,607 --> 00:42:51,407
(Second largest safari in the world)

999
00:42:51,407 --> 00:42:53,874
- Really? / - It's world's second biggest.

1000
00:42:53,874 --> 00:42:55,207
If you even have that...

1001
00:42:55,207 --> 00:42:59,407
- What about Khao Yai? / - You're so cruel.

1002
00:43:01,074 --> 00:43:03,540
(35 minutes by taxi from the restaurant to the safari)

1003
00:43:03,540 --> 00:43:05,040
- Kyunga. / - Yes, Haena.

1004
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:08,107
I'd love to bring you back to the childhood.

1005
00:43:08,907 --> 00:43:10,440
I'm going to be a child again?

1006
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:13,774
Today, pretend you're a child and enjoy.

1007
00:43:13,774 --> 00:43:17,040
- Okay. / - This place in Phu Quoc...

1008
00:43:17,074 --> 00:43:20,607
Is the biggest man-made safari

1009
00:43:20,607 --> 00:43:22,974
after the one in Africa.

1010
00:43:22,974 --> 00:43:24,507
- Really? / - Yes.

1011
00:43:24,507 --> 00:43:26,140
(The largest man-made safari is in the U.A.E.)

1012
00:43:26,140 --> 00:43:27,940
- No way. / - That's where you went?

1013
00:43:27,940 --> 00:43:29,874
- No. / - I was surprised.

1014
00:43:32,140 --> 00:43:33,874
(The second largest is in Vietnam)

1015
00:43:33,874 --> 00:43:36,307
It's incredibly huge.

1016
00:43:36,307 --> 00:43:38,140
It's the biggest man-made safari in Asia.

1017
00:43:38,140 --> 00:43:39,640
Is the whole area the safari?

1018
00:43:39,640 --> 00:43:41,307
Yes, the whole area.

1019
00:43:41,307 --> 00:43:42,807
It's a wildlife conservation area.

1020
00:43:43,174 --> 00:43:44,807
They came to greet us.

1021
00:43:44,807 --> 00:43:46,540
("V" Safari is the second largest safari in the world)

1022
00:43:46,540 --> 00:43:47,674
Isn't it amazing?

1023
00:43:47,907 --> 00:43:50,540
It looks very exotic.

1024
00:43:50,540 --> 00:43:53,107
If you stay at the resort we stayed in,

1025
00:43:53,107 --> 00:43:54,607
you don't have to pay for the entrance fee.

1026
00:43:54,607 --> 00:43:57,007
There is an amusement park,

1027
00:43:57,007 --> 00:43:59,540
a golf course and everything inside.

1028
00:43:59,540 --> 00:44:01,474
- It's so big! / - It's so cute.

1029
00:44:01,474 --> 00:44:02,940
It's so huge, right?

1030
00:44:03,340 --> 00:44:06,174
- What should we see first? / - This.

1031
00:44:06,174 --> 00:44:07,707
- Look over there. / - Oh, my.

1032
00:44:07,707 --> 00:44:08,807
Look at that.

1033
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:10,840
What is it?

1034
00:44:10,974 --> 00:44:13,640
- It's so cute. / - They're ring-tailed lemurs.

1035
00:44:13,907 --> 00:44:14,940
Hello.

1036
00:44:14,940 --> 00:44:17,807
- She was a little scared. / - I'm scared of monkeys.

1037
00:44:17,807 --> 00:44:19,874
Hello, we're Song Vacation.

1038
00:44:20,140 --> 00:44:21,940
- What's your name? / - He's standing still.

1039
00:44:22,040 --> 00:44:23,707
I didn't know monkeys were this docile.

1040
00:44:23,707 --> 00:44:25,640
- Hello. / - Are you two on a date?

1041
00:44:25,640 --> 00:44:27,707
- Hello. / - We got you.

1042
00:44:27,707 --> 00:44:30,440
- Hey, what are you? / - Hello.

1043
00:44:31,207 --> 00:44:33,140
They look so cute.

1044
00:44:33,140 --> 00:44:34,140
They look really cute.

1045
00:44:34,140 --> 00:44:36,674
- They're not scared of humans. / - It's fascinating.

1046
00:44:36,674 --> 00:44:38,107
- Should we try feeding them? / - Okay.

1047
00:44:38,107 --> 00:44:40,207
I heard we can feed them.

1048
00:44:40,674 --> 00:44:43,640
- You weren't in Yongin, were you? / - No, way.

1049
00:44:43,640 --> 00:44:46,907
This is a zoo. The safari is somewhere else.

1050
00:44:48,507 --> 00:44:50,107
They seem to eat more than us.

1051
00:44:50,107 --> 00:44:52,607
They eat corns, carrots, and grapes.

1052
00:44:52,707 --> 00:44:55,474
Kyunga, I thought they'd run toward us...

1053
00:44:55,474 --> 00:44:56,974
- If we feed them. / - You can go into the cage?

1054
00:44:57,107 --> 00:44:59,640
- You can go in? / - Yes, you can.

1055
00:44:59,974 --> 00:45:02,740
- My gosh. / - You can walk inside.

1056
00:45:02,740 --> 00:45:03,740
- Really? / - That sounds amazing.

1057
00:45:03,740 --> 00:45:06,707
As soon as we walked in, they ran toward us.

1058
00:45:06,707 --> 00:45:08,440
But monkeys are very violent.

1059
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:10,640
- I know. / - These monkeys were very nice.

1060
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:12,307
They're coming after us.

1061
00:45:12,874 --> 00:45:14,074
(The moment she gives a carrot)

1062
00:45:14,074 --> 00:45:15,407
- It's jumping. / - It's following you.

1063
00:45:15,407 --> 00:45:17,874
(A monkey jumped to her as she tried to give a carrot)

1064
00:45:19,007 --> 00:45:21,407
- Oh, no. / - What happened?

1065
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:24,307
It's following me!

1066
00:45:27,740 --> 00:45:28,974
She's being attacked.

1067
00:45:30,107 --> 00:45:30,874
She's being attacked.

1068
00:45:30,874 --> 00:45:32,940
They must've thought you were a tree.

1069
00:45:32,940 --> 00:45:35,640
- They thought you were a tree. / - I see.

1070
00:45:35,640 --> 00:45:37,107
Because you're so tall.

1071
00:45:37,107 --> 00:45:38,174
I've never seen that before.

1072
00:45:38,174 --> 00:45:40,740
(They're scary)

1073
00:45:41,107 --> 00:45:42,374
Can you jump?

1074
00:45:42,774 --> 00:45:45,307
(That's a piece of cake)

1075
00:45:45,340 --> 00:45:47,507
You're cute. That's mine.

1076
00:45:47,507 --> 00:45:50,074
- It's like holding a koala. / - I was so happy.

1077
00:45:51,274 --> 00:45:52,274
Hey.

1078
00:45:52,274 --> 00:45:54,207
(It fails to take the food)

1079
00:45:54,207 --> 00:45:55,374
I'll give you one.

1080
00:45:55,607 --> 00:45:57,340
They don't like carrots.

1081
00:45:57,340 --> 00:45:59,107
She's carrying three of them.

1082
00:45:59,107 --> 00:46:00,907
This one... Hey.

1083
00:46:00,907 --> 00:46:02,807
You can't just take the food.

1084
00:46:03,340 --> 00:46:05,774
(Corn tastes the best when I'm eating it alone)

1085
00:46:05,774 --> 00:46:07,840
It has facial expressions.

1086
00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:09,007
It's holding the camera.

1087
00:46:09,807 --> 00:46:12,374
- It hit your head. / - It's really gentle.

1088
00:46:12,474 --> 00:46:14,840
Its feet are like human hands.

1089
00:46:15,007 --> 00:46:16,740
They're like human hands.

1090
00:46:17,307 --> 00:46:18,440
It jumped.

1091
00:46:20,507 --> 00:46:21,674
(It takes a carrot)

1092
00:46:24,207 --> 00:46:27,174
(Then suddenly jumps)

1093
00:46:27,174 --> 00:46:28,340
That's amazing

1094
00:46:28,340 --> 00:46:31,807
I've never seen these lemurs in person.

1095
00:46:32,074 --> 00:46:35,307
- Haena, I'm a bit scared of... / - Yes.

1096
00:46:35,774 --> 00:46:37,340
- Feeding animals. / - Are you okay?

1097
00:46:37,407 --> 00:46:40,174
If we go past the zoo and go in more...

1098
00:46:40,174 --> 00:46:41,807
- You'll see wild beasts. / - Wild beasts?

1099
00:46:41,807 --> 00:46:44,374
There's a safari where you can see big animals.

1100
00:46:44,674 --> 00:46:47,707
They are all caged in, so you can just watch.

1101
00:46:47,707 --> 00:46:49,140
- It won't be scary. / - I don't have to feed them, right?

1102
00:46:49,140 --> 00:46:50,174
You don't have to.

1103
00:46:50,174 --> 00:46:52,040
You said you'd put me through hardship.

1104
00:46:52,040 --> 00:46:53,207
This is really hard.

1105
00:46:53,207 --> 00:46:55,974
- This is it. I was going to... / - It's really tough.

1106
00:46:56,607 --> 00:46:58,874
We're only doing the stuff I hate.

1107
00:46:59,374 --> 00:47:02,107
It's my day, so we'll do what I want.

1108
00:47:02,474 --> 00:47:03,807
Alright.

1109
00:47:04,274 --> 00:47:06,974
- Let's go. / - We'll go on to the safari.

1110
00:47:07,407 --> 00:47:10,340
- Kids would love that. / - They would.

1111
00:47:10,707 --> 00:47:12,940
We take this bus to go into the safari.

1112
00:47:12,940 --> 00:47:15,040
- Is this what we're riding? / - Yes.

1113
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:16,174
We just hop in.

1114
00:47:16,474 --> 00:47:17,874
That was so much fun.

1115
00:47:18,007 --> 00:47:19,640
- Seriously, I'll go there. / - Okay.

1116
00:47:19,640 --> 00:47:21,507
- Zoos are really great. / - You're right.

1117
00:47:21,807 --> 00:47:23,574
It makes you happy.

1118
00:47:24,340 --> 00:47:26,907
- Here we go. / - Let's go.

1119
00:47:27,207 --> 00:47:29,707
Welcome to the safari park.

1120
00:47:30,140 --> 00:47:32,107
- It's not a jeep. / - The entrance fee...

1121
00:47:32,107 --> 00:47:33,640
- No. / - It's a bus.

1122
00:47:33,874 --> 00:47:35,807
Let's go.

1123
00:47:35,807 --> 00:47:38,440
You seem way more excited than before.

1124
00:47:38,440 --> 00:47:40,607
I've really wanted to do this.

1125
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:43,874
I thought you could only go

1126
00:47:43,874 --> 00:47:45,774
to a safari like this in Africa.

1127
00:47:45,774 --> 00:47:47,707
- I know, right? / - This is so cool.

1128
00:47:47,707 --> 00:47:51,407
(What animal will they see first?)

1129
00:47:51,407 --> 00:47:53,374
- There it is. / - What? Where?

1130
00:47:53,607 --> 00:47:55,140
- What's that? / - Where?

1131
00:47:55,140 --> 00:47:56,240
- Over there. / - Where?

1132
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:57,307
- Here. / - I see.

1133
00:47:57,640 --> 00:47:59,007
- Are they deer? / - Goodness.

1134
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:03,307
They're so pretty.

1135
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:05,740
- Deer are so pretty. / - They are, aren't they?

1136
00:48:06,840 --> 00:48:07,940
They're cute.

1137
00:48:07,940 --> 00:48:10,340
There are so many of them.

1138
00:48:10,607 --> 00:48:12,774
- I've never seen one like that. / - Antelope.

1139
00:48:12,774 --> 00:48:15,240
There were so many different kinds of antelopes.

1140
00:48:16,007 --> 00:48:18,574
I guess they don't eat each other.

1141
00:48:18,574 --> 00:48:20,974
They are all herbivores.

1142
00:48:21,740 --> 00:48:24,007
They can't eat each other. My gosh.

1143
00:48:24,107 --> 00:48:25,940
There are so many of them.

1144
00:48:25,940 --> 00:48:27,874
Is it because they're herbivores?

1145
00:48:30,540 --> 00:48:32,140
We're going into somewhere different.

1146
00:48:32,707 --> 00:48:34,907
- We're going through a steel gate. / - This is it.

1147
00:48:34,907 --> 00:48:36,840
- This is the real safari. / - This is where it begins.

1148
00:48:37,207 --> 00:48:38,940
- This is similar. / - Yes.

1149
00:48:39,340 --> 00:48:41,007
It's so cool.

1150
00:48:42,907 --> 00:48:44,574
Please show yourselves.

1151
00:48:44,574 --> 00:48:48,340
(We wonder what lives here)

1152
00:48:49,407 --> 00:48:51,407
What is it? What's there?

1153
00:48:51,640 --> 00:48:52,940
What is it?

1154
00:48:52,940 --> 00:48:54,607
(Look at that!)

1155
00:48:54,807 --> 00:48:56,107
- Amazing. / - Rhinoceros!

1156
00:48:56,807 --> 00:48:58,574
- Awesome. / - Unbelievable.

1157
00:48:58,907 --> 00:49:01,040
I thought they were rocks. Amazing.

1158
00:49:01,240 --> 00:49:03,007
- I've never seen them before. / - They're huge.

1159
00:49:03,007 --> 00:49:04,940
- They're like rocks. / - They're really huge.

1160
00:49:05,007 --> 00:49:06,207
Amazing.

1161
00:49:08,007 --> 00:49:10,107
- Why are they all together? / - It must be too hot.

1162
00:49:10,307 --> 00:49:12,640
They're in the shade because it's hot.

1163
00:49:13,007 --> 00:49:16,874
- Amazing. / - I didn't think they'd be this big.

1164
00:49:16,907 --> 00:49:18,274
They're huge.

1165
00:49:18,707 --> 00:49:20,640
- Don't they have cute eyes? / - Yes.

1166
00:49:21,507 --> 00:49:23,540
They're like buttons.

1167
00:49:23,540 --> 00:49:25,407
- They have a lot of wrinkles around the eyes. / - Yes.

1168
00:49:25,407 --> 00:49:28,607
I've been to a safari in Africa for a shoot.

1169
00:49:28,740 --> 00:49:30,774
Rhinoceros usually don't come out like that.

1170
00:49:30,940 --> 00:49:32,707
They are dangerous animals

1171
00:49:32,707 --> 00:49:34,074
and they don't come near people.

1172
00:49:35,207 --> 00:49:36,740
Look at that.

1173
00:49:36,740 --> 00:49:38,107
- It's a lion. / - A lion.

1174
00:49:38,107 --> 00:49:39,607
It's the king of the jungle.

1175
00:49:39,607 --> 00:49:42,140
- It hates sunlight. / - The paws look so soft.

1176
00:49:43,074 --> 00:49:45,274
- Seriously. / - Goodness.

1177
00:49:45,274 --> 00:49:47,040
They're so cute.

1178
00:49:47,140 --> 00:49:49,540
Haena, there is a baby here.

1179
00:49:49,674 --> 00:49:51,407
- There's a baby. / - Where?

1180
00:49:51,407 --> 00:49:53,774
There's a foal.

1181
00:49:53,774 --> 00:49:55,907
It's so cute.

1182
00:49:55,907 --> 00:49:57,607
- It's so cute. / - It's really cute.

1183
00:49:57,707 --> 00:49:59,907
- Goodness. / - The foal is so cute.

1184
00:50:00,740 --> 00:50:03,140
- So cute. / - That's a popular hairstyle.

1185
00:50:05,074 --> 00:50:07,274
- There are giraffes. / - Where?

1186
00:50:07,274 --> 00:50:10,407
- There are giraffes. / - Gosh, my nickname is giraffe.

1187
00:50:11,940 --> 00:50:13,874
I've never seen so many giraffes.

1188
00:50:14,140 --> 00:50:15,840
- Hello. / - Look.

1189
00:50:17,140 --> 00:50:18,607
(Bye, giraffes)

1190
00:50:18,607 --> 00:50:21,340
- I'm losing track of time here. / - I know, right?

1191
00:50:21,607 --> 00:50:25,074
The safari was so much fun. The end!

1192
00:50:25,640 --> 00:50:27,074
Safaris are fun.

1193
00:50:27,140 --> 00:50:28,740
- They are. / - They're fun.

1194
00:50:28,874 --> 00:50:32,507
You just stay on the bus and not harm anything.

1195
00:50:32,507 --> 00:50:36,207
I want to highly recommend our trip because of this.

1196
00:50:36,207 --> 00:50:38,240
Where are we going after this?

1197
00:50:38,274 --> 00:50:41,240
This time, it's world's number one.

1198
00:50:41,940 --> 00:50:45,040
We'll ride the longest cable car in the world.

1199
00:50:45,140 --> 00:50:47,840
Haena, you only deal with the world's best.

1200
00:50:47,907 --> 00:50:48,940
Of course.

1201
00:50:49,574 --> 00:50:51,374
We'll go from number 2 to 1.

1202
00:50:51,374 --> 00:50:54,540
- That's good. / - Let's go ride the cable car.

1203
00:50:54,540 --> 00:50:56,674
- Let's go. / - Go, go.

1204
00:50:56,674 --> 00:50:58,007
(They're off to enjoy the world's longest cable car)

1205
00:50:58,007 --> 00:51:00,607
- Phu Quoc has a lot to offer. / - There's much to see.

1206
00:51:00,607 --> 00:51:03,474
(It takes about 1 hour from the safari by taxi)

1207
00:51:03,474 --> 00:51:06,207
This is where we'll ride the cable car.

1208
00:51:06,807 --> 00:51:09,374
- I can see it over there. / - You can see it, right?

1209
00:51:09,674 --> 00:51:13,107
It's the longest cable car in the world.

1210
00:51:13,107 --> 00:51:14,407
- This one? / - Yes.

1211
00:51:14,407 --> 00:51:16,074
Also the apparatus...

1212
00:51:16,707 --> 00:51:19,107
They built this new cable car.

1213
00:51:19,107 --> 00:51:21,440
It's the longest in the world.

1214
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:22,407
That's amazing.

1215
00:51:22,407 --> 00:51:26,607
It's the tallest so it is in the Guinness World Records.

1216
00:51:26,607 --> 00:51:29,007
- We'll pass five islands. / - Okay.

1217
00:51:29,007 --> 00:51:31,407
So we'll arrive at...

1218
00:51:31,407 --> 00:51:33,874
The cable car passes five islands.

1219
00:51:34,040 --> 00:51:35,874
- Hon Thom Island? / - Yes.

1220
00:51:35,874 --> 00:51:39,507
It goes all the way down to Hon Thom Island.

1221
00:51:40,807 --> 00:51:44,274
(This 7.9km long cable car passes 5 islands)

1222
00:51:44,274 --> 00:51:46,207
- It's endless. / - It doesn't stop.

1223
00:51:46,207 --> 00:51:49,140
Do you just go there and come back?

1224
00:51:49,140 --> 00:51:51,374
No, there are a lot of activities to do.

1225
00:51:51,374 --> 00:51:53,507
- You can enjoy water sports. / - On Hon Thom Island?

1226
00:51:53,507 --> 00:51:54,474
Then you go back.

1227
00:51:54,474 --> 00:51:55,507
Thank you.

1228
00:51:55,507 --> 00:51:58,074
(Cable car admission fee, $25)

1229
00:51:58,940 --> 00:52:02,040
(Let's go ride the cable car)

1230
00:52:02,707 --> 00:52:05,007
(The world-class cable car is right before their eyes)

1231
00:52:05,007 --> 00:52:06,240
It's huge.

1232
00:52:07,107 --> 00:52:08,640
It's really big, Haena.

1233
00:52:10,040 --> 00:52:13,274
(We're going on it!)

1234
00:52:16,674 --> 00:52:17,674
Wait.

1235
00:52:18,507 --> 00:52:20,474
I'm scared.

1236
00:52:22,874 --> 00:52:24,140
It's like an amusement park ride.

1237
00:52:25,474 --> 00:52:27,640
It takes 20 minutes to get to the end.

1238
00:52:27,674 --> 00:52:29,440
- I see. / - 20 minutes?

1239
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:31,774
Yes. It's very long.

1240
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:33,340
It's amazing.

1241
00:52:33,340 --> 00:52:36,074
Isn't it pretty? It keeps on going.

1242
00:52:36,140 --> 00:52:38,807
- There's a town too. / - Yes.

1243
00:52:39,240 --> 00:52:40,907
It's really high.

1244
00:52:42,074 --> 00:52:44,740
It's so nice because there's nothing blocking the view.

1245
00:52:45,574 --> 00:52:47,407
We can see everything.

1246
00:52:47,407 --> 00:52:48,707
(A panoramic view of Phu Quoc can be seen)

1247
00:52:48,707 --> 00:52:50,607
Unbelievable.

1248
00:52:51,274 --> 00:52:53,107
This is awesome.

1249
00:52:54,174 --> 00:52:56,307
It's like a scene from a movie.

1250
00:52:56,307 --> 00:52:57,707
- Right? / - Yes.

1251
00:52:57,707 --> 00:52:59,807
When you're up high like this,

1252
00:52:59,807 --> 00:53:03,340
you can see all the buildings and the rooftops.

1253
00:53:03,807 --> 00:53:05,540
- It's so pretty. / - If you ride it...

1254
00:53:05,540 --> 00:53:08,374
You can see the whole of Phu Quoc.

1255
00:53:08,807 --> 00:53:11,540
- It's going over the water. / - Yes.

1256
00:53:12,174 --> 00:53:13,607
- It's nice. / - Yes.

1257
00:53:13,607 --> 00:53:14,874
The view is beautiful.

1258
00:53:17,507 --> 00:53:18,940
Look at the color of the sea.

1259
00:53:18,974 --> 00:53:21,907
Isn't that emerald color?

1260
00:53:21,907 --> 00:53:24,207
- Amazing. / - The color of the sea is awesome.

1261
00:53:24,907 --> 00:53:27,074
It looks like paint is mixed in with the water.

1262
00:53:27,507 --> 00:53:30,074
- It's nice, Haena. / - Isn't it?

1263
00:53:30,074 --> 00:53:31,440
I like this course.

1264
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:34,407
- This is a must-do. / - You have to do this.

1265
00:53:34,740 --> 00:53:37,740
- We'll see a pillar that is... / - Yes.

1266
00:53:37,740 --> 00:53:39,074
On the world records.

1267
00:53:39,340 --> 00:53:41,874
It's not a building but a pillar.

1268
00:53:41,940 --> 00:53:43,040
Yes, it's a pillar.

1269
00:53:44,240 --> 00:53:46,574
(It's as tall as a 75-story building)

1270
00:53:46,574 --> 00:53:49,007
I can't feel how high this is.

1271
00:53:52,207 --> 00:53:54,107
I can't feel how high this is.

1272
00:53:54,974 --> 00:53:57,674
- That was 160m high. / - That's amazing.

1273
00:53:58,374 --> 00:54:00,107
(The sea looks so far away)

1274
00:54:00,107 --> 00:54:02,907
- It's huge. / - It looks really tall from here.

1275
00:54:02,907 --> 00:54:04,274
It's endless.

1276
00:54:04,274 --> 00:54:07,507
(It takes a while to look at the whole pillar)

1277
00:54:07,607 --> 00:54:10,040
It's nice. This is really nice.

1278
00:54:10,140 --> 00:54:13,240
The cable car was a great dating place.

1279
00:54:13,240 --> 00:54:17,907
(After the last pillar, they see Hon Thom Island)

1280
00:54:18,007 --> 00:54:20,440
We'll relax here for a bit.

1281
00:54:20,674 --> 00:54:22,507
Once we arrive on Hon Thom Island,

1282
00:54:22,507 --> 00:54:23,874
we'll enjoy water sports.

1283
00:54:23,907 --> 00:54:26,040
We haven't been in the water.

1284
00:54:26,040 --> 00:54:27,340
My feet went in the water.

1285
00:54:27,340 --> 00:54:29,307
We haven't been in the water.

1286
00:54:29,307 --> 00:54:30,907
My feet went in the water.

1287
00:54:31,340 --> 00:54:33,174
My hat went in the water too.

1288
00:54:33,840 --> 00:54:38,007
No! My hat!

1289
00:54:38,007 --> 00:54:40,240
But your body hasn't gone in the water yet.

1290
00:54:40,240 --> 00:54:43,640
If I drown, I'm going to step on you and come out.

1291
00:54:43,640 --> 00:54:45,607
(Kyunga can't swim)

1292
00:54:47,074 --> 00:54:48,607
I think you'll actually do that.

1293
00:54:49,040 --> 00:54:51,140
I was thinking out loud.

1294
00:54:51,140 --> 00:54:54,207
- I'm just kidding. / - Even if you go far out...

1295
00:54:54,207 --> 00:54:55,907
Your head will still be out of the water.

1296
00:54:56,707 --> 00:54:58,407
Perhaps.

1297
00:54:58,407 --> 00:55:00,240
- It'll be fun. / - I'll believe in you.

1298
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:02,074
(Let's go to Hon Thom Island for fun water sports!)

1299
00:55:03,374 --> 00:55:07,107
(30 minutes to Hon Thom Island by cable car)

1300
00:55:07,107 --> 00:55:10,740
Snorkeling in the sea is fun

1301
00:55:10,740 --> 00:55:12,807
but there's something I haven't tried.

1302
00:55:12,807 --> 00:55:16,440
You go on a board and paddle.

1303
00:55:16,474 --> 00:55:19,507
- A canoe? Paddle-boarding. / - I wanted to try that.

1304
00:55:20,674 --> 00:55:22,274
- Kayak. / - Kayaking is hard.

1305
00:55:22,274 --> 00:55:24,007
I wanted to try something like this.

1306
00:55:24,007 --> 00:55:26,340
I also wanted to try something like paddle boats.

1307
00:55:26,507 --> 00:55:28,774
You would look really tall if you stand up on there.

1308
00:55:31,174 --> 00:55:32,507
Should I plant a telephone pole there?

1309
00:55:34,407 --> 00:55:35,607
That's good.

1310
00:55:35,607 --> 00:55:36,874
I'll install the electric lines.

1311
00:55:38,540 --> 00:55:40,940
I'll have to see what kind of activity they will do.

1312
00:55:42,607 --> 00:55:45,140
You can enjoy marine sports there

1313
00:55:45,140 --> 00:55:46,074
if you make a reservation.

1314
00:55:46,074 --> 00:55:49,907
(Hon Thom Island is an activity paradise)

1315
00:55:51,974 --> 00:55:54,340
(The waves are quite unusual)

1316
00:55:54,340 --> 00:55:55,674
- It's too windy. / - What?

1317
00:55:55,740 --> 00:55:56,807
It's really windy.

1318
00:55:56,874 --> 00:55:58,574
- It wasn't good that day. / - The weather was...

1319
00:55:58,574 --> 00:56:00,840
- It can't be. / - The waves were too high.

1320
00:56:00,840 --> 00:56:01,974
The waves are really high.

1321
00:56:02,074 --> 00:56:03,474
You can't do any activities there.

1322
00:56:03,474 --> 00:56:04,607
- Gosh. / - Gosh.

1323
00:56:04,607 --> 00:56:06,340
The color of the water changed.

1324
00:56:09,174 --> 00:56:10,807
(Screaming)

1325
00:56:10,807 --> 00:56:12,474
The waves are too strong.

1326
00:56:17,140 --> 00:56:21,007
I said I prepared an activity, didn't I?

1327
00:56:22,607 --> 00:56:24,340
But it rained earlier...

1328
00:56:25,407 --> 00:56:27,174
So the waves are too strong.

1329
00:56:27,174 --> 00:56:28,474
- It's scary. / - Yes.

1330
00:56:28,540 --> 00:56:31,207
I wanted to go paddle boarding...

1331
00:56:31,240 --> 00:56:33,440
- Or kayaking. / - Yes.

1332
00:56:33,507 --> 00:56:34,807
- But we can't do it. / - Yes.

1333
00:56:35,207 --> 00:56:38,540
- So I prepared another activity. / - What is it?

1334
00:56:38,674 --> 00:56:40,240
Okay, let's go.

1335
00:56:41,240 --> 00:56:42,640
Let's go do the activity.

1336
00:56:42,640 --> 00:56:47,340
(Okay, let's go do the activity)

1337
00:56:49,707 --> 00:56:50,840
The activity.

1338
00:56:51,340 --> 00:56:52,674
This is the activity.

1339
00:56:52,674 --> 00:56:53,874
(She prepared a flamingo float for Kyunga)

1340
00:56:56,474 --> 00:56:58,640
- What is that? / - It was so nice until then.

1341
00:56:58,674 --> 00:57:02,007
- That was so fun. / - It looks fun.

1342
00:57:02,340 --> 00:57:03,774
(She prepared a flamingo float for Kyunga)

1343
00:57:03,774 --> 00:57:06,007
Kyunga, do you know how scary this is?

1344
00:57:06,007 --> 00:57:08,507
You can do this in Jeju-do.

1345
00:57:08,674 --> 00:57:10,840
This is on another scale.

1346
00:57:10,874 --> 00:57:13,307
It will be really exciting because of the waves.

1347
00:57:13,674 --> 00:57:15,640
Let's go. Let's get in the water.

1348
00:57:16,507 --> 00:57:19,607
(There is someone who is enjoying kayaking)

1349
00:57:19,607 --> 00:57:21,207
- Kyunga. / - This is not going to work.

1350
00:57:21,207 --> 00:57:24,640
- Come here. / - This is not going to work.

1351
00:57:25,707 --> 00:57:27,240
This is not going to work.

1352
00:57:29,340 --> 00:57:30,740
(Ideal)

1353
00:57:30,740 --> 00:57:33,574
(And reality)

1354
00:57:33,574 --> 00:57:35,540
(Ideal)

1355
00:57:35,540 --> 00:57:38,207
(And reality)

1356
00:57:41,074 --> 00:57:42,574
Kyunga, isn't this exciting?

1357
00:57:42,807 --> 00:57:44,374
This is not going to work.

1358
00:57:46,907 --> 00:57:48,407
I want to get on the float.

1359
00:57:50,007 --> 00:57:51,140
(She's on it)

1360
00:57:51,140 --> 00:57:54,040
(But she falls)

1361
00:57:56,140 --> 00:57:57,240
Oh, my.

1362
00:57:58,674 --> 00:57:59,740
I'm a bit...

1363
00:58:00,540 --> 00:58:02,574
Haena, I'm a little disappointed.

1364
00:58:02,574 --> 00:58:04,374
(This was filmed under the guidance of safety guards)

1365
00:58:05,474 --> 00:58:09,740
(Song Haena doesn't know how to give up)

1366
00:58:10,140 --> 00:58:13,807
(Kyunga caught the float that Haena missed)

1367
00:58:13,807 --> 00:58:15,740
(Laughing)

1368
00:58:18,774 --> 00:58:23,274
(Chaotic)

1369
00:58:24,240 --> 00:58:31,007
(It's quite sad watching them play in the water)

1370
00:58:31,540 --> 00:58:33,007
We're done with this activity.

1371
00:58:35,474 --> 00:58:37,140
It was active for me at least.

1372
00:58:37,307 --> 00:58:39,507
This made the things you did earlier look bad.

1373
00:58:39,807 --> 00:58:41,007
That's not true.

1374
00:58:41,040 --> 00:58:42,207
It gets better again.

1375
00:58:42,440 --> 00:58:43,674
I enjoyed it.

1376
00:58:44,640 --> 00:58:47,107
The waves were really high.

1377
00:58:47,407 --> 00:58:49,874
The weather was really cooperative,

1378
00:58:49,874 --> 00:58:52,474
so my activity plan was successful.

1379
00:58:52,507 --> 00:58:53,774
Did it really go according to plan?

1380
00:58:53,974 --> 00:58:55,474
Is this what you wanted?

1381
00:58:56,974 --> 00:58:58,374
- Gosh. / - Wait for me.

1382
00:58:58,374 --> 00:59:01,007
(No matter what people say, it was a good activity)

1383
00:59:01,074 --> 00:59:05,107
The highlight of today remains.

1384
00:59:05,107 --> 00:59:06,107
- Really? / - Yes.

1385
00:59:06,107 --> 00:59:08,640
You will really like this one.

1386
00:59:08,640 --> 00:59:10,007
- Are you sure? / - I'm sure.

1387
00:59:10,174 --> 00:59:12,007
Can you tell me what the next course is?

1388
00:59:12,007 --> 00:59:14,374
The next course...

1389
00:59:14,374 --> 00:59:18,774
The sunset is really beautiful in Phu Quoc.

1390
00:59:18,774 --> 00:59:20,374
- I heard about that. / - Yes.

1391
00:59:20,374 --> 00:59:21,940
- We have to see the sunset. / - Yes.

1392
00:59:21,940 --> 00:59:24,140
We'll see it at a good beach.

1393
00:59:24,140 --> 00:59:25,974
After that, we'll eat a really delicious meal.

1394
00:59:26,107 --> 00:59:27,640
- Okay. / - Yes.

1395
00:59:27,740 --> 00:59:28,940
Great.

1396
00:59:28,940 --> 00:59:31,907
(It was an activity that will remain a good memory)

1397
00:59:31,907 --> 00:59:34,574
- If the sunset succeeds, we'll win. / - Of course.

1398
00:59:35,040 --> 00:59:37,374
- I was worried here. / - I was really worried.

1399
00:59:37,507 --> 00:59:38,640
The activity was disappointing.

1400
00:59:38,874 --> 00:59:40,607
I hope you succeeded in watching the sunset.

1401
00:59:40,607 --> 00:59:41,740
Yes, we did.

1402
00:59:41,774 --> 00:59:43,774
- But it was fun. / - She became serious suddenly.

1403
00:59:43,774 --> 00:59:45,974
- The activity was a mess. / - You must go here.

1404
00:59:45,974 --> 00:59:47,474
So they changed their hopes to the sunset.

1405
00:59:48,874 --> 00:59:50,840
(35 minutes by taxi to the sunset beach bar)

1406
00:59:50,840 --> 00:59:53,507
(From the cable car)

1407
00:59:54,174 --> 00:59:57,274
Phu Quoc is really famous for sunsets.

1408
00:59:59,740 --> 01:00:04,407
(Time for the red sun to set)

1409
01:00:05,440 --> 01:00:09,240
Will you join me at a place with a good atmosphere?

1410
01:00:09,240 --> 01:00:10,707
Okay.

1411
01:00:12,707 --> 01:00:15,340
- You have to come here last. / - That's right.

1412
01:00:15,874 --> 01:00:18,107
It's also better...

1413
01:00:18,940 --> 01:00:20,174
- At night today. Right? / - It's charming.

1414
01:00:20,174 --> 01:00:22,407
(They're enjoying dinner on a beach)

1415
01:00:22,507 --> 01:00:25,740
It's not hot at night.

1416
01:00:26,340 --> 01:00:28,507
It's comfortable to stay seated. It's nice.

1417
01:00:28,774 --> 01:00:32,940
- You can hear the waves and music. / - Yes.

1418
01:00:33,407 --> 01:00:35,774
Since this is the end, I don't want to go.

1419
01:00:36,240 --> 01:00:38,507
- I don't want to go back. / - Me too.

1420
01:00:39,940 --> 01:00:42,574
- I don't want to go. / - You're right.

1421
01:00:44,107 --> 01:00:46,974
You have to go to places like that with your lover.

1422
01:00:46,974 --> 01:00:48,174
- Yes. / - That's right.

1423
01:00:48,174 --> 01:00:51,207
(Cocktails that contain Phu Quoc's coolness)

1424
01:00:51,207 --> 01:00:53,407
(Fish and chips)

1425
01:00:53,407 --> 01:00:54,540
Fish and chips?

1426
01:00:54,540 --> 01:00:57,140
That place was a little exotic,

1427
01:00:57,140 --> 01:00:59,840
so most of the customers were Westerners.

1428
01:00:59,840 --> 01:01:01,474
That's why the food was like that.

1429
01:01:01,474 --> 01:01:05,274
(Clapping like a seal)

1430
01:01:05,574 --> 01:01:07,640
Would you like some mojito in Phu Quoc?

1431
01:01:08,640 --> 01:01:10,874
- You had a mojito. / - Yes.

1432
01:01:14,507 --> 01:01:17,674
(Yum)

1433
01:01:18,074 --> 01:01:21,707
- Thanks for the food. It was fun. / - I had fun too.

1434
01:01:21,940 --> 01:01:24,807
You have to have fish and chips on a beach.

1435
01:01:25,174 --> 01:01:26,307
It's only $9.

1436
01:01:26,307 --> 01:01:27,340
- Yes. / - Gosh.

1437
01:01:27,874 --> 01:01:30,374
You have to have fish and chips at the beach.

1438
01:01:30,374 --> 01:01:32,207
- That's right. / - You have to have it.

1439
01:01:34,674 --> 01:01:38,074
Fish and chips taste different in every country.

1440
01:01:38,074 --> 01:01:40,040
- That's why I wanted to order it. / - You're right.

1441
01:01:40,740 --> 01:01:44,740
- The seafood is delicious here. / - You're right.

1442
01:01:44,740 --> 01:01:45,574
(Collaboration of crispy fried batter and juicy fish)

1443
01:01:47,174 --> 01:01:49,007
I really like meat.

1444
01:01:49,507 --> 01:01:50,740
Even steaks are cheap there.

1445
01:01:51,240 --> 01:01:52,774
- It's delicious. / - Is it delicious?

1446
01:01:53,340 --> 01:01:55,640
It's greasy but it's delicious because it's greasy.

1447
01:01:55,840 --> 01:01:58,140
It tastes a little like Chinese, the seasoning does.

1448
01:01:58,140 --> 01:02:00,974
- It's like sweet and sour pork. / - Yes.

1449
01:02:02,340 --> 01:02:03,507
It's delicious.

1450
01:02:03,640 --> 01:02:05,007
The atmosphere is also really nice.

1451
01:02:05,874 --> 01:02:09,440
It's so nice to have a cocktail and

1452
01:02:09,440 --> 01:02:11,007
eat delicious food on the last night.

1453
01:02:11,007 --> 01:02:11,974
Right?

1454
01:02:13,807 --> 01:02:17,040
This place isn't well-known to people yet.

1455
01:02:17,040 --> 01:02:18,807
We also didn't know well.

1456
01:02:19,074 --> 01:02:20,974
- I think places that aren't well-known... / - Yes.

1457
01:02:20,974 --> 01:02:23,640
Are more charming than well-known places.

1458
01:02:23,640 --> 01:02:25,474
It's because it feels like

1459
01:02:25,474 --> 01:02:27,674
I'm the only one who knows about it.

1460
01:02:28,174 --> 01:02:30,074
It feels like a special place.

1461
01:02:30,074 --> 01:02:31,274
Phu Quoc was exactly like that for me.

1462
01:02:31,274 --> 01:02:34,474
It was so natural, and the people were so friendly.

1463
01:02:34,474 --> 01:02:36,140
The food was also so delicious.

1464
01:02:36,440 --> 01:02:39,774
Who knew that the second biggest safari

1465
01:02:39,774 --> 01:02:41,307
in the world was here?

1466
01:02:41,307 --> 01:02:43,940
Who knew that the longest cable car

1467
01:02:43,940 --> 01:02:44,907
in the world was here?

1468
01:02:44,907 --> 01:02:46,974
The infrastructure is starting to establish.

1469
01:02:47,274 --> 01:02:48,874
It would be so nice if people came now.

1470
01:02:48,874 --> 01:02:52,107
There will be too many people if you come later...

1471
01:02:52,107 --> 01:02:54,407
You might not be able to come.

1472
01:02:54,407 --> 01:02:55,640
- That's right. / - Yes.

1473
01:02:57,074 --> 01:02:59,007
- I don't want it to be known. / - I know.

1474
01:02:59,007 --> 01:03:00,174
You have to come.

1475
01:03:00,340 --> 01:03:01,407
Should I tell people about it?

1476
01:03:03,007 --> 01:03:04,807
My inner conflict is so intense.

1477
01:03:05,007 --> 01:03:06,340
That happens. When it's so nice...

1478
01:03:06,340 --> 01:03:07,940
- You don't want to tell people. / - That's right.

1479
01:03:07,940 --> 01:03:09,340
I want to be the only one to know.

1480
01:03:09,340 --> 01:03:11,874
Since we enjoyed this place first,

1481
01:03:11,874 --> 01:03:13,940
let's tell people about it.

1482
01:03:13,940 --> 01:03:15,840
- I really wish people came here. / - Yes.

1483
01:03:15,907 --> 01:03:18,274
I really enjoyed our trip.

1484
01:03:18,274 --> 01:03:19,340
Me too.

1485
01:03:19,340 --> 01:03:20,840
In that sense...

1486
01:03:20,840 --> 01:03:23,840
- Let's chant one last time. / - Okay.

1487
01:03:24,340 --> 01:03:25,940
Song Vacation.

1488
01:03:25,940 --> 01:03:27,774
Let's go!

1489
01:03:28,974 --> 01:03:31,874
(Song Vacation in Phu Quoc, the end)

1490
01:03:31,874 --> 01:03:32,940
- That was fun. / - Gosh.

1491
01:03:35,974 --> 01:03:39,974
- First, the basic taxi rate was 30 cents. / - Yes.

1492
01:03:39,974 --> 01:03:41,940
- What about that coconut? / - It was $1.

1493
01:03:41,940 --> 01:03:43,507
- It was 10 cents. / - It was 10 cents.

1494
01:03:43,774 --> 01:03:46,274
Vietnam is really cost effective to travel.

1495
01:03:46,740 --> 01:03:49,440
You don't feel any burden from the food cost.

1496
01:03:49,440 --> 01:03:51,307
It's like 10 cents and $1.

1497
01:03:51,307 --> 01:03:53,107
We're confident of our total expense.

1498
01:03:53,107 --> 01:03:54,640
I don't think they used a lot.

1499
01:03:54,640 --> 01:03:55,774
How much did you use?

1500
01:03:55,774 --> 01:03:58,907
For 3 days 2 nights of Song Vacation,

1501
01:03:58,907 --> 01:04:02,974
the total expense excluding the airfare is...

1502
01:04:02,974 --> 01:04:03,807
What's the total expense?

1503
01:04:03,807 --> 01:04:06,307
$488.

1504
01:04:06,307 --> 01:04:08,107
- $488? / - Yes.

1505
01:04:08,107 --> 01:04:09,274
Okay.

1506
01:04:09,274 --> 01:04:10,807
Let's start the final vote.

1507
01:04:10,807 --> 01:04:14,074
Would you like to go to Phu Quoc,

1508
01:04:14,074 --> 01:04:17,274
Vietnam according to Song Vacation plan?

1509
01:04:17,907 --> 01:04:19,374
Please vote.

1510
01:04:20,740 --> 01:04:23,507
(They planned a trip to an emerging vacation spot)

1511
01:04:23,507 --> 01:04:26,640
(What will the judges choose?)

1512
01:04:28,974 --> 01:04:31,807
This isn't the end of the emerging vacation spots.

1513
01:04:31,807 --> 01:04:34,507
I heard that it will be about the grand nature next week.

1514
01:04:34,507 --> 01:04:36,774
We will leave for Khao Yai that boasts grand nature.

1515
01:04:36,774 --> 01:04:39,574
We'll come back next week with a place

1516
01:04:39,574 --> 01:04:41,107
that will make you forget about the summer heat.

1517
01:04:42,374 --> 01:04:44,040
(Next episode)

1518
01:04:44,040 --> 01:04:45,507
We'll enter nature.

1519
01:04:45,507 --> 01:04:46,707
Enjoying nature as naturalists.

1520
01:04:46,707 --> 01:04:49,374
It's fascinating. I keep staring.

1521
01:04:49,374 --> 01:04:51,774
I've never seen anything like this before.

1522
01:04:51,774 --> 01:04:53,640
There are monkeys on the street...

1523
01:04:53,640 --> 01:04:56,340
An elephant! It's an elephant!

1524
01:04:56,340 --> 01:04:58,174
Ta-da. This is it!

1525
01:04:58,174 --> 01:05:00,440
This is what you call a proper vacation.

1526
01:05:00,440 --> 01:05:03,274
It's the oldest and largest winery.

1527
01:05:03,274 --> 01:05:04,140
This tastes so good.

1528
01:05:04,140 --> 01:05:06,140
I'm not going to forget this.

1529
01:05:06,140 --> 01:05:07,574
I want to come back next time.

1530
01:05:07,574 --> 01:05:09,610
(Battle Trip)

1531
01:05:09,935 --> 01:05:26,135
(RUN by Lee Jinah)
