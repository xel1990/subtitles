00:00:00,807 --> 00:00:04,407
(Numerous great tips on trips)

2
00:00:05,307 --> 00:00:06,540
(Kim Sook, Sung Sikyung)

3
00:00:07,507 --> 00:00:08,874
(Lee Hwijae, Kim Saerom)

4
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:09,840
Travel is war!

5
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:12,540
Battle Trip!

6
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:15,140
Nice to see you again.

7
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:17,740
We have a very special host today.

8
00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:20,607
- It's Kim Saerom. / - Welcome.

9
00:00:21,907 --> 00:00:26,507
In fact, a life goal for my 30s...

10
00:00:26,507 --> 00:00:29,074
- Is going on trips. / - That's so nice.

11
00:00:29,074 --> 00:00:30,940
So I go on a trip every month.

12
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:33,807
- Really? / - Both domestic and overseas.

13
00:00:33,807 --> 00:00:35,474
Where did you go recently?

14
00:00:35,474 --> 00:00:38,874
I went to Busan 2 weeks ago, Japan 3 weeks ago.

15
00:00:38,874 --> 00:00:42,540
This is episode 96 of Battle Trip.

16
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:44,607
- It's almost 100. / - But the fact that we haven't...

17
00:00:44,607 --> 00:00:46,607
Had a show on this theme yet shows

18
00:00:46,607 --> 00:00:48,707
that we'll last a really long time.

19
00:00:48,707 --> 00:00:49,874
- What is it? / - What is the theme?

20
00:00:49,874 --> 00:00:53,440
Today's theme is a domestic island trip.

21
00:00:53,774 --> 00:00:56,440
- Most commonly... / - We haven't had this theme?

22
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:58,974
The first islands that come to mind are Jeju-do,

23
00:00:58,974 --> 00:01:00,740
Ulleungdo and Ganghwado.

24
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:01,874
- We have a lot of islands. / - Yes.

25
00:01:01,874 --> 00:01:03,707
I have some statistics.

26
00:01:03,707 --> 00:01:05,174
How many islands do you think there are in Korea?

27
00:01:05,174 --> 00:01:07,307
3,358.

28
00:01:07,907 --> 00:01:10,574
Among them, 482 are named.

29
00:01:10,574 --> 00:01:13,674
That means there are over 2,000 unnamed islands.

30
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:17,007
We can do 1,000 episodes of Battle Trip...

31
00:01:17,007 --> 00:01:19,674
- If we go to those 2,000 islands. / - No.

32
00:01:19,907 --> 00:01:22,674
Then you'll end up being like "Korea Sings."

33
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:26,807
Should we go on a host special to an island?

34
00:01:26,807 --> 00:01:28,374
That's nice. An island special.

35
00:01:28,374 --> 00:01:30,907
Today's island special Battle Trip.

36
00:01:30,907 --> 00:01:33,074
Let us bring out the four trip designers.

37
00:01:33,074 --> 00:01:34,807
Come on out.

38
00:01:34,807 --> 00:01:37,174
(Who are the trip designers?)

39
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:39,240
(Kim Hyunchul, Cho Janghyuck)

40
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:40,240
Hello.

41
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:41,440
(Park Jeongcheol, Kim Seungsoo)

42
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:45,274
You can tell right away that they'll all best friends.

43
00:01:45,274 --> 00:01:47,307
- Really? / - Doesn't it feel like that?

44
00:01:47,307 --> 00:01:50,340
Hyunchul and Janghyuck are friends, aren't you?

45
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:52,607
- We're friends. / - What kind of friends are you?

46
00:01:53,174 --> 00:01:55,240
He was born 3 months later than me.

47
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:57,740
Why would you nitpick over that?

48
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:02,340
He only has his age to show off.

49
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:04,707
He only has his age.

50
00:02:04,707 --> 00:02:05,674
What about the two on Hwijae's team?

51
00:02:05,674 --> 00:02:07,640
- It's a senior-junior relationship? / - Yes.

52
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:11,107
He's 5 years younger than me.

53
00:02:11,307 --> 00:02:13,740
Everyone's surprised.

54
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:15,740
- Why are you so surprised? / - He's so baby faced!

55
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:18,174
- Of course. / - I'm still young.

56
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:20,640
I've known Seungsoo for a very long time.

57
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:23,307
- But it's our first time traveling together. / - Yes.

58
00:02:23,307 --> 00:02:26,507
So I was worried at first.

59
00:02:26,507 --> 00:02:28,407
- Really? / - He's not just older than you.

60
00:02:28,407 --> 00:02:31,274
- He's your senior actor. / - Wasn't it difficult?

61
00:02:31,274 --> 00:02:33,340
- He's your direct senior. / - It's difficult.

62
00:02:34,474 --> 00:02:36,707
- Is that so? / - It's difficult now.

63
00:02:36,707 --> 00:02:38,374
- Are you telling me just now? / - I told...

64
00:02:38,374 --> 00:02:41,107
The staff that it will either be a success or a failure...

65
00:02:41,107 --> 00:02:43,007
- On this trip. / - Right.

66
00:02:43,007 --> 00:02:46,074
Yes, whether we will go on the next trip together...

67
00:02:46,074 --> 00:02:48,274
- Or not depends on this trip. / - That could happen.

68
00:02:48,274 --> 00:02:50,807
You learn about that on the trip.

69
00:02:50,807 --> 00:02:52,907
Isn't it the first time traveling together for

70
00:02:52,907 --> 00:02:53,940
Hyunchul and Janghyuck too?

71
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:55,240
- Yes, it's our first time. / - It's our first time.

72
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:58,274
I didn't know I'd travel with him.

73
00:02:58,274 --> 00:02:59,740
We have different hobbies.

74
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:01,307
We couldn't go on a trip together.

75
00:03:01,307 --> 00:03:05,507
I think we got closer after this trip.

76
00:03:05,507 --> 00:03:08,340
Will you go on a trip together again next time?

77
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:10,774
Are you insane?

78
00:03:10,774 --> 00:03:13,040
It's not that bad.

79
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,274
It's a domestic island trip.

80
00:03:14,274 --> 00:03:16,974
Seungsoo and Jeongcheol, where did you go?

81
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:21,307
We went to the Naples of Korea.

82
00:03:22,074 --> 00:03:25,240
A beautiful port city, Tongyeong, Gyeongsangnam-do.

83
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:27,340
- I really want to go there. / - Tongyeong is beautiful.

84
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:28,907
- You won't fail with Tongyeong. / - And?

85
00:03:28,907 --> 00:03:31,874
There's another beautiful island that's

86
00:03:31,874 --> 00:03:33,174
unstained from the world.

87
00:03:33,174 --> 00:03:34,574
- Yokjido. / - Yokjido?

88
00:03:34,574 --> 00:03:37,974
Is Yokjido still unstained?

89
00:03:37,974 --> 00:03:40,074
- It's still unstained. / - It's been a long time.

90
00:03:40,074 --> 00:03:43,074
Which islands did Hyunchul and Janghyuck go to?

91
00:03:43,074 --> 00:03:46,407
"Land of beautiful scenery, far and wide."

92
00:03:46,407 --> 00:03:49,607
Do you know where that's from? The start.

93
00:03:49,607 --> 00:03:52,007
- The start? / - It's Haenam.

94
00:03:52,007 --> 00:03:54,074
- I see. / - Wow, Haenam.

95
00:03:54,074 --> 00:03:58,074
- And? / - The island surrounded by clear waters.

96
00:03:58,074 --> 00:03:58,874
Wando.

97
00:03:58,874 --> 00:04:00,840
- Wando? / - Yes, Wando.

98
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,507
- What's famous there? / - It's a healthy island.

99
00:04:02,507 --> 00:04:04,640
It's a match between Gyeongsang-do and Jeolla-do.

100
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,240
They also have very different flavors in food.

101
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:09,307
- That's right. / - This special sounds so charming.

102
00:04:09,307 --> 00:04:11,640
- Let's check the map. / - Let's see it.

103
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:13,774
- They are quite far. / - Tongyeong, Yokjido.

104
00:04:13,774 --> 00:04:14,274
And Wando.

105
00:04:14,274 --> 00:04:17,140
- Isn't that Haenam? / - That's Tongyeong.

106
00:04:17,974 --> 00:04:20,040
They're going in opposite directions.

107
00:04:20,274 --> 00:04:23,507
Tongyeong has the Hallyeohaesang National Park.

108
00:04:23,507 --> 00:04:26,340
Wando has the Dadohaehaesang National Park.

109
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:28,540
It's the most beautiful ocean of Gyeongsang-do

110
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:31,007
vs. the most beautiful ocean of Jeolla-do.

111
00:04:31,007 --> 00:04:32,607
- I'm looking forward to it. / - Yes.

112
00:04:32,607 --> 00:04:34,907
Why did you choose Yokjido?

113
00:04:34,907 --> 00:04:37,474
We chose it because it's a delicious island.

114
00:04:37,474 --> 00:04:39,207
- Yokjido? / - Yes.

115
00:04:39,207 --> 00:04:43,007
It's famous for mackerel and sweet potatoes.

116
00:04:44,507 --> 00:04:47,907
It's hard to eat raw mackerel in Seoul.

117
00:04:47,907 --> 00:04:49,540
- The price is also a problem. / - It's expensive.

118
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:52,640
It's so abundant over there.

119
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:54,240
- Mackerel? / - Yes.

120
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,107
- They serve it at cart bars. / - Cart bars.

121
00:04:56,107 --> 00:04:58,107
The mackerel is so fresh,

122
00:04:58,107 --> 00:05:02,740
that you wouldn't imagine that it was mackerel.

123
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:04,140
- It's really good. / - We need to hurry to see that.

124
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:06,107
We can't lose. Why did you choose

125
00:05:06,107 --> 00:05:07,574
Haenam and Wando?

126
00:05:07,574 --> 00:05:10,740
On the first day, we ate Korean traditional food.

127
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:12,974
- Jeolla-do is known for food. / - Everything is good.

128
00:05:12,974 --> 00:05:15,307
We ate health food the next day.

129
00:05:15,307 --> 00:05:16,307
- Health foods? / - Yes.

130
00:05:16,307 --> 00:05:17,640
Did it help energize you?

131
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:20,707
- More than enough. / - It was more than enough.

132
00:05:20,707 --> 00:05:22,307
Did you feel something different after eating it?

133
00:05:22,307 --> 00:05:23,340
You'll know when you see it.

134
00:05:23,874 --> 00:05:25,507
You ate proper health food then.

135
00:05:25,507 --> 00:05:26,674
He's saying not to worry.

136
00:05:26,674 --> 00:05:31,407
Over 60,000 people supported us.

137
00:05:31,407 --> 00:05:33,440
- What? / - 60,000?

138
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,207
- How? / - Did you do a live stream?

139
00:05:35,207 --> 00:05:39,307
The locals are the most objective experts.

140
00:05:39,307 --> 00:05:40,674
- That's right. / - The locals.

141
00:05:40,674 --> 00:05:43,407
Among those locals,

142
00:05:43,407 --> 00:05:49,040
there are some older women who like us.

143
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:51,440
They stepped in to help us

144
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,240
and gave us the best information.

145
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:55,540
- They must've been popular. / - The thing is...

146
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:58,440
Kim Seungsoo is the middle aged Park Bogum.

147
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:01,607
Park Jeongcheol is the middle aged Song Joongki.

148
00:06:01,607 --> 00:06:04,374
The streets were lined with their female fans.

149
00:06:04,374 --> 00:06:06,240
- Okay. / - That's good.

150
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,340
Tongyeong and Yokjido. Haenam and Wando.

151
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:09,974
Gyeongsang-do vs. Jeolla-do.

152
00:06:09,974 --> 00:06:12,940
- Oysters vs. abalone. / - That's right.

153
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:14,874
It's singers vs. actors as well.

154
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:16,740
It's a hard match.

155
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:19,174
We have our 100 impartial judges

156
00:06:19,174 --> 00:06:21,507
who will vote on today's trips.

157
00:06:21,507 --> 00:06:23,040
Welcome.

158
00:06:25,474 --> 00:06:28,707
You're not voting on just the trip you liked,

159
00:06:28,707 --> 00:06:30,307
you can vote for both.

160
00:06:30,307 --> 00:06:32,207
You can vote for both trips.

161
00:06:32,207 --> 00:06:36,140
Yes. We are unfamiliar with Yokjido,

162
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:38,307
so we want to see it first.

163
00:06:38,307 --> 00:06:39,774
Yes, sure.

164
00:06:39,774 --> 00:06:41,840
Let's watch Tongyeong, Yokjido first.

165
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,007
What's the tour name?

166
00:06:43,174 --> 00:06:46,540
It's the One Day Three Meals Tour.

167
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:48,207
- One Day Three Meals. / - You only had 3 meals?

168
00:06:48,207 --> 00:06:49,374
If you watch...

169
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:51,374
- It's like 3 meals... / - I was surprised.

170
00:06:51,374 --> 00:06:53,707
- I thought you were the GM. / - Alright.

171
00:06:53,707 --> 00:06:56,140
Let's visit Tongyeong and Yokjido

172
00:06:56,140 --> 00:06:58,140
with the One Day Three Meals Tour.

173
00:06:58,140 --> 00:06:59,774
Let's see it together.

174
00:07:01,474 --> 00:07:03,340
- Hi, Seungsoo. / - Hey.

175
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:04,240
You're here.

176
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,307
(They met to design the trip)

177
00:07:06,307 --> 00:07:07,207
Sit down, sit down.

178
00:07:07,207 --> 00:07:09,774
They don't look comfortable with each other.

179
00:07:10,774 --> 00:07:15,274
I met you when we were in our 20s.

180
00:07:15,274 --> 00:07:16,907
That's right.

181
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:20,707
He's 5 years older than me.

182
00:07:20,707 --> 00:07:23,574
Back then, I wasn't comfortable around him.

183
00:07:23,574 --> 00:07:24,140
Of course...

184
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:27,274
The younger ones always bring up age.

185
00:07:27,274 --> 00:07:28,874
Of course it's much better now.

186
00:07:28,874 --> 00:07:30,740
I'm over 40 now.

187
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:33,874
He's much more friendlier now.

188
00:07:33,874 --> 00:07:36,074
After going on this trip...

189
00:07:36,074 --> 00:07:38,840
- Yeah. / - I think I'll like you even more.

190
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:41,007
It's our first trip together.

191
00:07:41,007 --> 00:07:43,874
- Yes. / - It will be a meaningful time.

192
00:07:43,874 --> 00:07:46,374
Yeah. Thank you.

193
00:07:47,774 --> 00:07:50,074
- It's an island trip this week. / - Island?

194
00:07:50,307 --> 00:07:51,607
I see.

195
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:55,340
I've never even been to Ulleungdo.

196
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:56,507
I haven't been either.

197
00:07:56,507 --> 00:08:00,074
The only island I've been to is Jeju-do.

198
00:08:00,074 --> 00:08:03,540
I don't think I've been to many islands.

199
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:06,574
That's right. I think people don't travel to islands.

200
00:08:06,574 --> 00:08:09,374
Men don't travel together to islands.

201
00:08:09,374 --> 00:08:11,340
- They don't. / - You get a lot of couples.

202
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:14,640
- Or families. / - A lot of families do.

203
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:16,407
It's because the sunset is beautiful.

204
00:08:16,407 --> 00:08:17,740
It's good to go with the opposite sex.

205
00:08:19,474 --> 00:08:22,874
I really haven't traveled much.

206
00:08:22,874 --> 00:08:24,807
- I really haven't. / - Yes, I know it.

207
00:08:26,407 --> 00:08:30,407
The most important thing about traveling is food.

208
00:08:30,407 --> 00:08:32,774
- I agree. / - What else is there?

209
00:08:32,774 --> 00:08:34,674
We'll revolve around food.

210
00:08:34,674 --> 00:08:38,840
We'll have to search for the best restaurants first.

211
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:40,740
I'm experienced at searching,

212
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:43,140
so I usually don't fail anymore.

213
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:45,740
- He likes to search. / - Search Fairy.

214
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:48,007
- I have a lot of experience. / - He's good at planning.

215
00:08:48,007 --> 00:08:49,240
- Really? / - Yes.

216
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,974
- It's good to have people like him. / - He's the best.

217
00:08:50,974 --> 00:08:52,874
That's something you have to be born with.

218
00:08:52,874 --> 00:08:54,707
Have you been to any cities around Namhae?

219
00:08:54,707 --> 00:08:57,074
I've been to Tongyeong about 4 to 5 times.

220
00:08:57,074 --> 00:09:00,174
- Really? / - I went there for work and travel.

221
00:09:00,174 --> 00:09:02,907
I've never been to Tongyeong.

222
00:09:02,907 --> 00:09:04,407
You've never been to Tongyeong?

223
00:09:05,474 --> 00:09:08,874
- I've seen it on TV. / - He's so worried.

224
00:09:08,874 --> 00:09:10,674
With Tongyeong...

225
00:09:10,674 --> 00:09:13,774
If you follow along Hallyeohaesang National Park,

226
00:09:13,774 --> 00:09:15,940
there are a lot of islands around

227
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:17,074
Yeosu and Tongyeong.

228
00:09:17,074 --> 00:09:18,807
- We only have a short amount of time. / - Yes, yes.

229
00:09:18,807 --> 00:09:21,074
If we decide on Tongyeong, since I've been there...

230
00:09:21,074 --> 00:09:23,107
- Go to islands around Tongyeong. / - That's right.

231
00:09:23,107 --> 00:09:25,174
- That sounds good. / - Let's start searching then.

232
00:09:25,174 --> 00:09:27,774
- Islands near Tongyeong. / - Right.

233
00:09:27,774 --> 00:09:28,874
He's the Search Fairy.

234
00:09:28,874 --> 00:09:29,874
There's a lot.

235
00:09:29,874 --> 00:09:33,340
Somaemuldo, Yeonhwado, Yokjido, Bijindo.

236
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:35,674
- People go to Bijindo a lot. / - I've heard of Bijindo.

237
00:09:35,674 --> 00:09:38,574
Yokjido is the closest.

238
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:42,640
I don't think there's anything more to consider.

239
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:45,440
Let's search Yokjido. Let's see what's here.

240
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:47,640
The name is attractive, Yokjido.

241
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:50,574
Mackerel is famous here.

242
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:53,674
The island seems to be a good size.

243
00:09:53,674 --> 00:09:55,307
- I think there are things to see. / - Yes.

244
00:09:55,307 --> 00:09:57,007
- Let's go to Yokjido. / - Agreed.

245
00:09:57,007 --> 00:09:59,007
One day in Tongyeong and one day in Yokjido.

246
00:10:01,207 --> 00:10:05,007
(A coastal city surrounded by the sea on three sides)

247
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:06,707
(It's famous for seafood)

248
00:10:06,707 --> 00:10:09,274
- What is that? / - That's all abalone.

249
00:10:09,274 --> 00:10:11,674
- It's common there. / - They're so big.

250
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:15,974
(You can eat raw mackerel here)

251
00:10:15,974 --> 00:10:17,574
Oh, wow.

252
00:10:17,574 --> 00:10:19,740
- That's the stuff. / - That's it.

253
00:10:22,874 --> 00:10:23,640
Look how beautiful it is.

254
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:26,374
- It looked like another country. / - You're right.

255
00:10:26,374 --> 00:10:28,507
You guys had great weather.

256
00:10:28,507 --> 00:10:32,074
I'll trust you to plan the trip.

257
00:10:32,074 --> 00:10:33,774
- Don't worry. / - Please do your best.

258
00:10:33,774 --> 00:10:35,974
The schedule is short. We'll have a tight schedule.

259
00:10:35,974 --> 00:10:38,340
- Okay. / - But we'll be able to relax...

260
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:41,607
And have fun. I'll plan it well.

261
00:10:41,607 --> 00:10:44,474
So all I have to do is, "What's next?"

262
00:10:44,474 --> 00:10:45,640
Of course.

263
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:46,874
Okay.

264
00:10:46,874 --> 00:10:48,774
A food columnist will help out the other team.

265
00:10:48,774 --> 00:10:51,107
A food columnist? Isn't that cheating?

266
00:10:51,107 --> 00:10:52,840
- That's unfair. / - That's cheating.

267
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:56,307
Is it because they're older than us?

268
00:10:56,307 --> 00:10:58,474
- What? / - What are they saying?

269
00:10:58,474 --> 00:10:59,940
You're not that much younger.

270
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:01,740
They're not that much older.

271
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:03,007
Oh, they're much older. I see.

272
00:11:03,007 --> 00:11:06,440
They might have to look at the screen like this.

273
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:08,174
They might have those problems.

274
00:11:08,174 --> 00:11:09,507
So should we be understanding?

275
00:11:09,507 --> 00:11:11,274
- But still, it's a food columnist. / - Yeah.

276
00:11:11,274 --> 00:11:14,040
- A columnist... / - It's unfair for them to have an expert.

277
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:14,540
Yeah.

278
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:17,574
But don't worry too much.

279
00:11:17,574 --> 00:11:22,840
We have our female fans there.

280
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:24,840
(Are you watching us?)

281
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:28,707
All the attractive ladies in Tongyeong and Yokjido

282
00:11:28,707 --> 00:11:30,107
are on our side.

283
00:11:30,607 --> 00:11:32,707
Look here. Tongyeong population.

284
00:11:32,707 --> 00:11:35,707
68,000 men and 67,000 women.

285
00:11:35,707 --> 00:11:37,140
- Really? / - Yeah.

286
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:38,307
(Food columnist vs. Yokjido ladies)

287
00:11:38,307 --> 00:11:39,540
67,000 is a lot.

288
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:40,507
The expert can't beat them.

289
00:11:40,507 --> 00:11:42,674
The expert can't beat the ladies.

290
00:11:42,674 --> 00:11:44,540
Let's talk to the residents there.

291
00:11:45,474 --> 00:11:46,740
That sounds good.

292
00:11:48,174 --> 00:11:50,240
(Their ship cleaved Tongyeong's clouds)

293
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,707
I heard they were so popular.

294
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:57,940
(The support of 69,000 Tongyeong and Yokjido ladies)

295
00:11:59,174 --> 00:12:00,907
They couldn't move because it was so crowded.

296
00:12:01,707 --> 00:12:04,840
(The middle-aged Park Bogum?)

297
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:06,774
(No!)

298
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:09,640
Saved in our my heart.

299
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:14,274
(Kim Seungsoo, 48, debuted in 1997, old man)

300
00:12:14,774 --> 00:12:17,174
(He's the epitome of a charismatic man)

301
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:21,174
(Laughs like a dolphin)

302
00:12:21,174 --> 00:12:21,974
Let's go, Seungsoo!

303
00:12:21,974 --> 00:12:23,074
Nice, Seungsoo.

304
00:12:23,074 --> 00:12:24,174
It's our first trip.

305
00:12:24,507 --> 00:12:26,207
He's a cute guy to his seniors.

306
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,374
Hey, this is fun.

307
00:12:31,374 --> 00:12:32,674
This is awesome.

308
00:12:32,674 --> 00:12:34,940
Take this!

309
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:38,407
(Like they're children again)

310
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,307
Look at the food.

311
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:46,107
- Goodness. This is Gyeongsang-do, right? / - Yes..

312
00:12:46,107 --> 00:12:49,340
- They might beat us. / - I was really surprised.

313
00:12:51,607 --> 00:12:52,407
- Cheers. / - Cheers.

314
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:56,740
That wasn't just three meals.

315
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,674
- Let's go. / - You need to go seaside.

316
00:12:59,674 --> 00:13:01,340
You're right.

317
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:02,707
They clearly have lots to eat.

318
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:05,374
They have Chungmu rice rolls there.

319
00:13:05,374 --> 00:13:07,074
In Tongyeong.

320
00:13:07,074 --> 00:13:08,940
Been a while since I tried siraegi soybean paste soup.

321
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:10,774
- What's siraegi soybean paste soup? / - You know it.

322
00:13:10,774 --> 00:13:13,374
It's dried radish greens.

323
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:18,040
(It's a 4-hour trip from Seoul to Tongyeong)

324
00:13:18,907 --> 00:13:21,340
(They hurry and take off)

325
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:23,174
So you planned to meet in Tongyeong?

326
00:13:23,174 --> 00:13:24,274
- Yes. / - On location.

327
00:13:24,274 --> 00:13:27,507
(4 hours by car)

328
00:13:29,407 --> 00:13:34,107
(It rained this morning)

329
00:13:34,774 --> 00:13:35,940
It's a turtle ship.

330
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:38,040
Yes, Admiral Yi Sunsin.

331
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:40,007
Goodness! Look at that.

332
00:13:40,007 --> 00:13:42,007
- You had great weather. / - It's so clear.

333
00:13:42,007 --> 00:13:42,807
Wow.

334
00:13:42,807 --> 00:13:44,207
- Did you have good weather too? / - No fine dust.

335
00:13:44,207 --> 00:13:46,074
Our weather went back and forth.

336
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:51,107
Hang on a second.

337
00:13:51,574 --> 00:13:53,407
It won't open.

338
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:56,574
Hang on a second. Let me do this again.

339
00:13:56,574 --> 00:13:59,207
It normally opens automatically. But today...

340
00:13:59,207 --> 00:14:00,540
That happens sometimes.

341
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:02,740
It looks cooler when it opens automatically.

342
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:05,140
Normally, it opens with one click.

343
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:07,474
Geez. Why didn't it work.

344
00:14:07,474 --> 00:14:09,007
This is embarrassing.

345
00:14:09,007 --> 00:14:12,107
It's been 6 or 7 years since I visited Tongyeong.

346
00:14:12,107 --> 00:14:15,307
Nothing has changed. It's just like before.

347
00:14:15,307 --> 00:14:17,807
- It's peaceful there. / - Right. It's peaceful.

348
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:21,340
It looks virtually the same.

349
00:14:21,607 --> 00:14:23,940
(All alone)

350
00:14:24,107 --> 00:14:25,774
Why isn't Seungsoo coming?

351
00:14:27,007 --> 00:14:28,940
I will try calling him.

352
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:41,874
He's not picking up.

353
00:14:41,874 --> 00:14:44,940
What if I have to travel alone today?

354
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:49,774
I feel lonely.

355
00:14:52,674 --> 00:14:54,974
Jeongcheol!

356
00:14:56,540 --> 00:14:58,574
He made his voice louder.

357
00:14:58,574 --> 00:15:00,207
- You came early. / - It was abdominal breathing.

358
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:03,774
Goodness.

359
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:07,274
What's going on here?

360
00:15:07,274 --> 00:15:09,507
This is just something simple.

361
00:15:09,507 --> 00:15:12,974
There's lots to eat here in Tongyeong.

362
00:15:12,974 --> 00:15:15,174
You must try Chungmu rice rolls.

363
00:15:15,174 --> 00:15:17,307
- It's really nothing but it's so good. / - It's good.

364
00:15:17,307 --> 00:15:19,207
- If you get it from a good place... / - Right.

365
00:15:20,774 --> 00:15:21,907
Hello.

366
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:24,540
- Oh, hello! / - Ma'am.

367
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:25,107
Yes?

368
00:15:25,107 --> 00:15:27,607
I searched for a good place and I found this place.

369
00:15:27,607 --> 00:15:29,174
Would you like some?

370
00:15:29,174 --> 00:15:31,907
We'd like some to go so we can share.

371
00:15:31,907 --> 00:15:33,874
- I'll make it right away. / - It's unseasoned laver.

372
00:15:33,874 --> 00:15:36,074
- That's delicious. / - The fish cake.

373
00:15:36,074 --> 00:15:38,107
- The seasoned fish cake. / - With squid.

374
00:15:39,807 --> 00:15:41,374
(The local dish of Tongyeong)

375
00:15:41,374 --> 00:15:42,907
It was my first time in Tongyeong.

376
00:15:42,907 --> 00:15:44,540
But I like Chungmu rice rolls a lot

377
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:45,740
and I was so surprised by that.

378
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:47,674
- It tastes different, right? / - Yes, it does.

379
00:15:47,674 --> 00:15:49,140
Because they use great ingredients.

380
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:50,507
- It's different? / - It's different.

381
00:15:50,507 --> 00:15:51,974
- The seaweed is different. / - That...

382
00:15:52,174 --> 00:15:54,474
You can have around 3,000 calories worth of it.

383
00:15:54,474 --> 00:15:56,540
- He's right. / - I'm serious.

384
00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:59,507
You eat the fish cake, then the squid then the rice.

385
00:15:59,507 --> 00:16:01,140
You keep going non-stop.

386
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,840
- You can't stop. / - That fish cake...

387
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:07,140
They only have it in Tongyeong.

388
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:08,840
- They serve it with squid. / - The squid.

389
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:11,574
- They go so well together. / - Yes, it tastes so good.

390
00:16:11,574 --> 00:16:13,174
This is so good.

391
00:16:14,174 --> 00:16:15,440
It's good, right?

392
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:19,540
It tastes like the original Chungmu rice rolls.

393
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:20,374
Yeah.

394
00:16:20,374 --> 00:16:23,374
There are some good places in Seoul as well

395
00:16:23,374 --> 00:16:24,807
but it's a bit too sweet there.

396
00:16:24,807 --> 00:16:27,740
I can feel that the kimchi here tastes richer.

397
00:16:28,307 --> 00:16:30,040
The seasoning doesn't taste too strong.

398
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:31,140
Seriously.

399
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:32,840
- That's it. / - That's the stuff.

400
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:34,474
- That's how you eat it. / - That's it.

401
00:16:34,474 --> 00:16:36,174
You have to eat it with a squid leg.

402
00:16:36,174 --> 00:16:37,707
- The triple combo of Chungmu rice rolls. / - Crunchy.

403
00:16:37,707 --> 00:16:40,140
You're right! It's spicy and crunchy.

404
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:44,607
It seems like you're going to stay there all day.

405
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:49,007
Tongyeong food is pretty good.

406
00:16:49,574 --> 00:16:52,540
This isn't the end of your first meal, right?

407
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:55,607
I actually wanted to make that the one and only meal.

408
00:16:55,607 --> 00:16:57,674
It was just so good. I wanted to keep eating.

409
00:16:57,674 --> 00:16:59,040
- It'd be perfect with instant noodles. / - I stopped him.

410
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:00,674
Instant noodles would make it game over.

411
00:17:00,674 --> 00:17:02,340
This is your last one. Stop eating now.

412
00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:04,474
There are so many things to eat.

413
00:17:05,007 --> 00:17:06,107
But this is tasty.

414
00:17:06,107 --> 00:17:07,574
That's your last piece.

415
00:17:08,074 --> 00:17:10,307
- Geez! / - You can't stop.

416
00:17:10,474 --> 00:17:12,407
See? I told you to stop eating.

417
00:17:12,407 --> 00:17:14,340
- It was so good. / - It's okay. Let's go.

418
00:17:14,340 --> 00:17:16,174
There's always one older friend like him.

419
00:17:16,607 --> 00:17:18,307
Guys that need a lot of care.

420
00:17:18,774 --> 00:17:21,074
- It's fine. / - Let's ride the same car.

421
00:17:21,074 --> 00:17:23,140
- Your car? / - Yes, my car.

422
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:24,307
Sure, sure.

423
00:17:24,507 --> 00:17:25,774
- Let's go. / - Okay.

424
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:27,607
Let's go.

425
00:17:28,207 --> 00:17:29,907
I heard there's siraegi soybean paste soup.

426
00:17:30,274 --> 00:17:31,807
- Siraegi soybean paste soup? / - Yes.

427
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:33,907
It's similar to hangover soup.

428
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:36,907
Oh, it's a local traditional dish.

429
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:38,940
It's dried radish greens in dialect.

430
00:17:39,507 --> 00:17:42,040
This could be a nice breakfast or lunch menu.

431
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:45,040
If you had a drink the night before...

432
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:45,840
Exactly.

433
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:48,740
It'd be a great hangover soup.

434
00:17:49,074 --> 00:17:51,940
It looks delicious.

435
00:17:52,807 --> 00:17:54,140
Siraegi soybean paste soup.

436
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:56,507
Why do I keep salivating with these photos?

437
00:17:56,507 --> 00:17:57,240
- What's that? / - It's salivating.

438
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:59,840
- Siraegi soybean paste soup? / - That's right.

(One Day Three Meals Tour in Tongyeong)

440
00:18:02,274 --> 00:18:04,874
Is eating all you do?

441
00:18:04,874 --> 00:18:06,407
You should have gone sightseeing.

442
00:18:06,407 --> 00:18:11,207
We're going to the next food place right after we ate?

443
00:18:11,574 --> 00:18:14,740
We don't have time. Since this is a short trip...

444
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:16,474
- Just think that we'll keep eating. / - Nice.

445

The restaurants in the markets taste better, right?

446
00:18:21,174 --> 00:18:21,707
Exactly.

00:18:21,707 --> 00:18:23,107

- The weather! / - Nice colors.

Look at the road.

450
00:18:26,207 --> 00:18:31,507
You have a beautiful wife and the prettiest daughter.

451
00:18:31,507 --> 00:18:33,707
I'm jealous. So you should suffer today.

452

He didn't.

We'll have some siraegi soybean paste soup

00:18:44,274 --> 00:18:47,474
and I'll look for some cute girls for you.

458

This is going to be a very meaningful trip.

459

462
00:18:58,707 --> 00:19:00,240
It's a traditional market.

00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,474
- It's Seoho Market. / - Right, it's Seoho Market.

464

- Hello. / - Hello.

481
00:19:34,374 --> 00:19:36,140
They must not make the broth with anchovies

482
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:37,774
but something else.

483
00:19:38,607 --> 00:19:39,340
- From my memory... / - It looks so good.

484
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:40,640
- Look at that color. / - They reveal the secret.

485
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,374
How can it not be delicious?

486
00:19:42,374 --> 00:19:43,774
With clams.

487
00:19:45,407 --> 00:19:49,307
(The people in the market start the day with soup)

488
00:19:49,307 --> 00:19:51,840
- The broth looks thick. / - Made of soybean paste.

489
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:53,107
They use eel.

490
00:19:53,107 --> 00:19:56,440
My dad adds rice and red pepper paste in it.

491
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:57,974
- That sounds good too. / - Gyeongsang-do style.

492
00:19:57,974 --> 00:20:00,774
You could drink like a liter of that without thinking.

493
00:20:02,374 --> 00:20:04,240
- It's nothing special. / - Chives.

494
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:07,440
- That's so cheap. / - That's the chives.

495
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:10,107
($4.50 for rice and soup, $5 for rice in soup)

496
00:20:11,474 --> 00:20:13,807
- I've never seen such a restaurant. / - Me neither.

497
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:15,774
What is that?

498
00:20:15,774 --> 00:20:18,507
- Side dishes. / - You have a buffet of side dishes.

499
00:20:18,507 --> 00:20:19,707
It's all you can eat.

500
00:20:20,507 --> 00:20:22,807
Just like I heard, it's a buffet.

501
00:20:22,807 --> 00:20:25,507
- That's so... / - They give you so much.

502
00:20:26,407 --> 00:20:29,907
We'd like to have two rice and soups, please.

503
00:20:30,174 --> 00:20:33,340
I will plate various dishes here.

504
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:34,740
What they don't have there...

505
00:20:35,274 --> 00:20:38,107
Just plain rice with all those sides...

506
00:20:38,107 --> 00:20:39,874
- They have eggs too? / - Yes.

507
00:20:39,874 --> 00:20:41,274
There's meat as well.

508
00:20:41,274 --> 00:20:43,240
- And it's $5? / - It is.

509
00:20:43,807 --> 00:20:44,907
It's cheap.

510
00:20:45,007 --> 00:20:45,874
That's amazing.

511
00:20:45,874 --> 00:20:47,274
- And it's unlimited? / - Yes, it's unlimited.

512
00:20:47,274 --> 00:20:48,807
- That's insane. / - You can eat...

513
00:20:48,807 --> 00:20:51,374
- As much as you want and it's $10. / - Exactly.

514
00:20:56,274 --> 00:20:59,574
(They finally taste the siraegi soybean paste soup)

515
00:21:02,174 --> 00:21:05,074
The base of this soup is...

516
00:21:05,074 --> 00:21:06,774
It's eel broth.

517
00:21:06,774 --> 00:21:08,407
- Yes, it's eel broth. / - Eel broth?

518
00:21:08,407 --> 00:21:10,407
It doesn't smell fishy at all.

519
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:14,207
- Isn't that right? / - It's not fishy at all.

520
00:21:14,207 --> 00:21:15,140
It's the soybean paste rids of the smell.

521
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:15,907
You'd never know.

522
00:21:15,907 --> 00:21:17,974
So it's a rice soup.

523
00:21:17,974 --> 00:21:20,240
If they didn't have perilla in it,

524
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:23,707
the fishiness of the eel might have remained.

525
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:27,907
But the perilla completely removed the fishiness.

526
00:21:28,607 --> 00:21:31,807
- It tasted clean but deep. / - Yes.

527
00:21:32,807 --> 00:21:35,174
The soup has depth of flavor.

528
00:21:36,807 --> 00:21:38,240
That's why the color was like that.

529
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:40,707
- Laver and chives. / - Yes, dried laver.

530
00:21:41,407 --> 00:21:43,240
Isn't this health food?

531
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:46,740
- I also like to drink alcohol. / - That looks so good.

532
00:21:47,674 --> 00:21:49,607
- I also like to drink alcohol. / - That's delicious.

533
00:21:49,607 --> 00:21:52,674
I've tried everything to cure hangovers.

534
00:21:52,674 --> 00:21:54,674
But that was the best hangover cure of my life.

535
00:21:54,674 --> 00:21:56,507
Would you go to Tongyeong for this?

536
00:21:56,507 --> 00:21:58,140
- Yes, I could go there again. / - Yes.

537
00:21:58,574 --> 00:22:00,240
It must be really good.

538
00:22:01,274 --> 00:22:04,674
Siraegi soybean paste soup is really delicious.

539
00:22:04,674 --> 00:22:06,340
Thank you for the food.

540
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:07,674
- Thank you for the food. / - It was so good.

541
00:22:07,674 --> 00:22:09,140
Have some rice punch.

542
00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:10,974
Rice punch?

543
00:22:10,974 --> 00:22:12,440
Thank you so much.

544
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:13,940
We'll take some with us.

545
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:19,374
- $5 for all this. / - There's a nice spot.

546
00:22:19,374 --> 00:22:21,940
- It's 5 minutes away. / - Yes?

547
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:23,674
You know Dongpirang Village, right?

548
00:22:23,674 --> 00:22:25,507
- Yes, I've been there. / - I've heard of it.

549
00:22:25,507 --> 00:22:28,040
We have Seopirang Village, which is just as good.

550
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:28,940
- Seopirang? / - Yes.

551
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:31,407
There's a Seopirang Village? Like east and west.

552
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:38,907
(Many visit Dongpirang Village to see murals)

553
00:22:38,907 --> 00:22:41,640
- That's so pretty. / - Does "pirang" mean waves?

554
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:43,107
- No, it means cliffs. / - It means cliffs.

555
00:22:43,107 --> 00:22:44,774
- Cliffs? / - Yes, cliffs.

556
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:47,840
- The west cliff and the east cliff. / - Yes.

557
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:51,074
- The names are so pretty. / - Dongpirang is famous.

558
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:55,374
I don't think a lot of people know Seopirang.

559
00:22:55,374 --> 00:22:58,507
It's a nice quiet village.

560
00:22:58,507 --> 00:23:00,740
You can see all of downtown Tongyeong.

561
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:02,207
It relieves all your stress.

562
00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:08,307
(10 minutes from Seoho Market to Seopirang Village)

563
00:23:08,307 --> 00:23:09,640
The weather is so nice, isn't it?

564
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:12,907
- It's like summer. / - Yes.

565
00:23:12,907 --> 00:23:15,174
- There's a map here. / - There's a map.

566
00:23:15,174 --> 00:23:16,274
Let's take a look.

567
00:23:16,274 --> 00:23:18,940
- Where are we right now? / - We're right here.

568
00:23:19,407 --> 00:23:20,640
The 99 Stairs.

569
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:22,940
- It's right near the entrance. / - Yes.

570
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:25,540
If we go up here, there's Seoporu.

571
00:23:26,874 --> 00:23:29,707
Seopirang has only been known for 4 or 5 years.

572
00:23:31,174 --> 00:23:32,874
So it's still quiet.

573
00:23:32,874 --> 00:23:34,107
- It's nice. / - Hello.

574
00:23:35,507 --> 00:23:36,540
- It's the Greeting Street. / - Yes

575
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:39,307
- They accepted our greetings well. / - Greeting Street.

576
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:42,774
This is a great idea. Greeting Street.

577
00:23:43,874 --> 00:23:47,307
(You come across the 99 Stairs as you walk along)

578
00:23:47,307 --> 00:23:48,774
Is this the 99 Stairs?

579
00:23:48,774 --> 00:23:51,140
This is the start. This is the 99th step.

580
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:53,007
This is the 99 Stairs.

581
00:23:53,007 --> 00:23:54,574
It means we have to go up there.

582
00:23:55,007 --> 00:23:55,974
Do you have to walk up there?

583
00:23:55,974 --> 00:23:57,707
- Do you have to walk up the stairs? / - It was near.

584
00:23:57,707 --> 00:23:59,974
It was only 5 to 10 minutes from Seoho Market.

585
00:23:59,974 --> 00:24:01,440
- Yes. / - 99 Stairs?

586
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,340
- It won't take long. / - It won't take long.

587
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:08,340
(Slope on the west side that connects to Seoporu)

588
00:24:08,874 --> 00:24:12,874
(A path to take a leisurely walk)

589
00:24:12,874 --> 00:24:14,374
We have to greet people here.

590
00:24:14,374 --> 00:24:15,940
- Hello. / - Hello.

591
00:24:18,974 --> 00:24:20,140
Seoulites...

592
00:24:20,807 --> 00:24:22,474
That lady was really surprised.

593
00:24:22,474 --> 00:24:24,240
The middle-aged Park Bogum...

594
00:24:24,707 --> 00:24:26,240
She has to take her phone out.

595
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:28,574
- Middle-aged Song Joongki. / - Wait a minute!

596
00:24:28,574 --> 00:24:30,574
Wait a minute!

597
00:24:31,607 --> 00:24:33,807
- Give it to me, I'll take a selfie. / - We'll take a selfie.

598
00:24:33,807 --> 00:24:35,174
Let me take it.

599
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:37,640
- I can't believe this. / - I'll do it.

600
00:24:38,574 --> 00:24:40,340
1, 2, 3.

601
00:24:40,574 --> 00:24:41,707
Thank you.

602
00:24:41,707 --> 00:24:43,340
- Goodness. / - I can't believe this.

603
00:24:44,207 --> 00:24:45,674
Oh, my.

604
00:24:45,674 --> 00:24:47,374
- Have a nice trip. / - Bye.

605
00:24:47,374 --> 00:24:48,240
Bye.

606
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:49,574
(Thank you)

607
00:24:50,207 --> 00:24:52,374
I didn't know at first but it's hard.

608
00:24:52,374 --> 00:24:54,040
I'm starting to run out of breath.

609
00:24:54,974 --> 00:24:57,374
- Gosh. / - It's so relaxing here.

610
00:24:57,774 --> 00:24:59,374
It's hard to just climb the stairs.

611
00:24:59,374 --> 00:25:01,974
Let's climb with a goal.

612
00:25:02,540 --> 00:25:03,974
Let's think of the old times

613
00:25:03,974 --> 00:25:05,140
and do rock, paper, scissors.

614
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:07,007
This guy's a romantic.

615
00:25:07,007 --> 00:25:07,974
It's been a really long time.

616
00:25:07,974 --> 00:25:10,107
- Didn't people do that in the 1960s? / - Right.

617
00:25:10,107 --> 00:25:12,040
When there was nothing else to play.

618
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:14,140
I've never seen men do this.

619
00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:15,574
You win with rock and it's 3 steps.

620
00:25:15,574 --> 00:25:17,840
- You win with paper and it's 5 steps. / - Got it.

621
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:18,974
There's a penalty.

622
00:25:18,974 --> 00:25:20,640
- What is it? / - The winner gets to...

623
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,440
Flick the loser on the forehead.

624
00:25:22,607 --> 00:25:24,174
- The forehead? / - Yeah.

625
00:25:24,174 --> 00:25:25,707
I want to hit your forehead.

626
00:25:27,574 --> 00:25:28,674
Okay. Sure.

627
00:25:29,407 --> 00:25:31,274
It sounds like you think you're going to win.

628
00:25:31,274 --> 00:25:32,407
I'm really bad at rock, paper, scissors.

629
00:25:32,507 --> 00:25:33,907
Rock, paper, scissors.

630
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:36,140
Look at you being greedy and playing paper.

631
00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:37,474
I want to climb 5 steps.

632
00:25:37,707 --> 00:25:38,974
Rock, paper, scissors.

633
00:25:39,507 --> 00:25:41,107
- This is 2 steps, isn't it? / - Yes, 2 steps.

634
00:25:42,307 --> 00:25:43,107
1, 2.

635
00:25:43,107 --> 00:25:44,807
Rock, paper, scissors.

636
00:25:46,107 --> 00:25:47,240
You're quite good.

637
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:48,774
Rock, paper, scissors.

638
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:51,740
- You get quite competitive. / - Really?

639
00:25:51,740 --> 00:25:53,074
- Yes. / - I feel like a kid.

640
00:25:53,074 --> 00:25:53,740
Rock, paper, scissors.

641
00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:55,107
Oh, yeah!

642
00:25:55,574 --> 00:25:56,974
There's only a few left.

643
00:25:56,974 --> 00:25:59,174
What a fun way to climb stairs.

644
00:25:59,174 --> 00:26:01,274
They're using abdominal breathing.

645
00:26:01,274 --> 00:26:02,407
I'm in trouble.

646
00:26:02,407 --> 00:26:04,107
Rock, paper, scissors.

647
00:26:04,107 --> 00:26:05,440
Oh, yeah! 1, 2.

648
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:06,807
- I have one step left. / - Just one?

649
00:26:08,307 --> 00:26:09,507
Do your best until the last round.

650
00:26:09,807 --> 00:26:12,007
- It's the last round. / - You can end it in one game.

651
00:26:12,374 --> 00:26:14,540
Rock, paper, scissors.

652
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:15,907
(Can Jeongcheol come from behind?)

653
00:26:16,374 --> 00:26:18,840
(Or will Seungsoo win as expected?)

654
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:22,007
(Seungsoo wins)

655
00:26:22,007 --> 00:26:23,840
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

656
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:25,307
Seungsoo, I lost.

657
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:27,074
Flick on the forehead.

658
00:26:27,074 --> 00:26:28,940
I'll let you hit my forehead like a man.

659
00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:30,740
I want to hit your forehead.

660
00:26:32,874 --> 00:26:34,574
- You have to be a man, right? / - Yeah, yeah.

661
00:26:34,574 --> 00:26:35,707
Here we go.

662
00:26:37,274 --> 00:26:38,974
(Please)

663
00:26:41,774 --> 00:26:44,374
He hit me lightly on purpose.

664
00:26:44,374 --> 00:26:45,474
No...

665
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:47,907
- Now it's starting to hurt. / - Yeah.

666
00:26:47,907 --> 00:26:49,674
- He looks upset. / - Gosh, it hurts.

667
00:26:50,507 --> 00:26:53,407
- We had fun climbing the stairs. / - Seungsoo...

668
00:26:53,407 --> 00:26:54,974
- It was so fun. / - Yes.

669
00:26:54,974 --> 00:26:58,674
I don't even remember when I did this last.

670
00:26:58,674 --> 00:27:01,340
- I know. / - It was fun doing it with you.

671
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:07,207
These are cosmos but I don't know what these are.

672
00:27:07,207 --> 00:27:08,574
That's the hill of Seopirang.

673
00:27:08,574 --> 00:27:11,007
There are flowers. The view gets better as you go up.

674
00:27:11,007 --> 00:27:12,240
Wow, what's that?

675
00:27:14,107 --> 00:27:16,040
That's really well built.

676
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:19,007
(A little further and it's Seoporu)

677
00:27:19,007 --> 00:27:22,807
I saw the murals in Dongpirang a while ago.

678
00:27:22,807 --> 00:27:23,607
Really?

679
00:27:23,607 --> 00:27:25,374
There were a lot of people there.

680
00:27:25,374 --> 00:27:26,874
It's really famous.

681
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:32,774
- Is this it? / - This is the end.

682
00:27:32,774 --> 00:27:35,174
Even if you wanted to climb, there isn't anything else.

683
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:37,607
- It's really nice. / - Look over there.

684
00:27:38,174 --> 00:27:40,407
You can see the ocean in the distance?

685
00:27:40,407 --> 00:27:42,007
You can see all of Tongyeong.

686
00:27:42,007 --> 00:27:45,240
- It's so beautiful. / - You can see it all.

687
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:47,374
(They take a short break)

688
00:27:47,374 --> 00:27:50,407
- Rice punch! / - Good thing you brought that!

689
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:53,040
Good job.

690
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:54,440
You can fill it with 3 cup's worth.

691
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:57,474
(One Day Three Meals Tour)

692
00:27:57,474 --> 00:27:59,840
(Luge)

693
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:03,374
There's another reason why I want to go to Tongyeong.

694
00:28:03,374 --> 00:28:04,907
Have you ever heard of the luge?

695
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:07,774
- That's in Winter Olympics. / - That's right.

696
00:28:07,774 --> 00:28:09,307
I don't know if it came from that

697
00:28:09,307 --> 00:28:10,874
but there's a place where you can ride sleds like that.

698
00:28:10,874 --> 00:28:12,907
- Like in luge? / - Yes.

699
00:28:12,974 --> 00:28:15,074
When my daughter grows up,

700
00:28:15,074 --> 00:28:17,574
I want to go there together.

701
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:19,307
There's the Merlion.

702
00:28:19,307 --> 00:28:21,040
There are famous places.

703
00:28:22,607 --> 00:28:24,874
(Luge you can enjoy in Korea)

704
00:28:25,407 --> 00:28:27,607
- The course was amazing. / - It really was.

705
00:28:27,607 --> 00:28:28,674
Is it 1.5km?

706
00:28:28,674 --> 00:28:31,440
- Yes. / - It takes about 10 minutes.

707
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:33,007
- It's quite long. / - It's very long.

708
00:28:33,007 --> 00:28:35,474
So you take the 99 Stairs up?

709
00:28:35,474 --> 00:28:36,240
No, you use a lift.

710
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:37,907
- Oh, it's somewhere else? / - Yes, it's a lift.

711
00:28:37,907 --> 00:28:39,340
Just like a ski resort.

712
00:28:39,740 --> 00:28:40,940
Look at that.

713
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:42,307
"Once is never enough."

714
00:28:42,307 --> 00:28:44,574
- It's true. / - It's true.

715
00:28:45,974 --> 00:28:48,174
You need to experience it more times.

716
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:50,374
Hello.

717
00:28:50,374 --> 00:28:51,807
Two adults please.

718
00:28:52,174 --> 00:28:54,774
That's $24.

719
00:28:54,774 --> 00:28:57,740
- Children can ride it too, right? / - Yes.

720
00:28:57,740 --> 00:28:59,907
Yes, with a guardian.

721
00:28:59,907 --> 00:29:03,040
It goes down without an external force

722
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:04,107
so the slope is quite steep.

723
00:29:06,674 --> 00:29:09,074
- Rotate it. / - Okay.

724
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:12,040
It's been a long time since I've ever taken a lift.

725
00:29:12,774 --> 00:29:15,240
- You have to go to ski resorts for these. / - Yeah.

726
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:17,907
It's about 35-floors high.

727
00:29:17,907 --> 00:29:19,674
- Is it that high? / - It is quite high.

728
00:29:19,674 --> 00:29:20,974
You went up quite a bit.

729
00:29:23,740 --> 00:29:25,940
We're finally at the starting point.

730
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:28,907
(Tongyeong luge, 1.5km, 100m high, 30 corners)

731
00:29:28,907 --> 00:29:31,674
- Is that the only one in Korea? / - Yeah.

732
00:29:31,674 --> 00:29:33,674
There are only a few in the world.

733
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:38,774
People on medication shouldn't take this ride.

734
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:41,107
We have to wear safety helmets.

735
00:29:41,107 --> 00:29:44,474
- Be careful not to get stuck. / - Okay.

736
00:29:45,274 --> 00:29:47,374
- Your feet should stay in the cart. / - Yes.

737
00:29:48,307 --> 00:29:50,007
You have to receive training as well.

738
00:29:50,507 --> 00:29:52,374
- Lean right back? / - Yes, right back.

739
00:29:52,374 --> 00:29:54,340
- This is the brake. / - To the left.

740
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:59,840
Shouldn't we bet something to make it more fun?

741
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:02,874
- Let's ignite our competitive juices. / - That's right.

742
00:30:02,874 --> 00:30:04,107
Let's do this.

743
00:30:04,107 --> 00:30:07,740
We're having dinner after this, right?

744
00:30:08,207 --> 00:30:12,040
The loser pays for everyone on this trip.

745
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:13,740
- A group dinner? / - Yeah. One of us.

746
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:15,740
- Sounds good. / - The loser pays. Agreed?

747
00:30:15,740 --> 00:30:17,340
- Agreed! / - Okay.

748
00:30:18,374 --> 00:30:20,474
Let's start with serious determination.

749
00:30:20,474 --> 00:30:22,107
- Let's go. / - Okay.

750
00:30:23,207 --> 00:30:25,940
(With their pride at stake)

751
00:30:33,207 --> 00:30:34,474
(This was filmed in cooperation with the staff)

752
00:30:34,474 --> 00:30:36,840
- Go. / - Go.

753
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:43,174
(Start)

754
00:30:44,607 --> 00:30:45,740
(Excited)

755
00:30:45,740 --> 00:30:48,174
- Hey, this is fun! / - This is amazing.

756
00:30:50,307 --> 00:30:53,574
(Jeongcheol is pulling ahead of the race)

757
00:30:55,140 --> 00:30:56,707
I'm taking the inside lane.

758
00:30:56,707 --> 00:30:58,807
Oh, the inside lane!

759
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:00,840
No, no.

760
00:31:01,974 --> 00:31:03,407
(He overtakes him)

761
00:31:03,407 --> 00:31:05,307
I'm right behind you.

762
00:31:06,007 --> 00:31:08,707
- Wasn't that scary though? / - It was quite fast.

763
00:31:08,707 --> 00:31:10,107
You must adjust your speed well.

764
00:31:10,107 --> 00:31:12,874
The path down is so pretty.

765
00:31:13,974 --> 00:31:15,007
Come closer.

766
00:31:18,374 --> 00:31:19,940
Check out that ocean.

767
00:31:21,607 --> 00:31:24,807
(Enjoying the view of the ocean is a bonus)

768
00:31:24,807 --> 00:31:25,774
Hello.

769
00:31:27,474 --> 00:31:29,207
- What was that? / - It dips down like a cliff.

770
00:31:29,207 --> 00:31:30,640
It's quite surprising.

771
00:31:31,074 --> 00:31:32,940
Jumping over it would be so fun.

772
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:36,240
(They pass through the difficult section)

773
00:31:38,307 --> 00:31:39,840
I had no idea that was there.

774
00:31:40,540 --> 00:31:41,740
I was so surprised.

775
00:31:41,740 --> 00:31:43,707
- That was incredible. / - I agree.

776
00:31:44,174 --> 00:31:45,240
What a surprise.

777
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:46,374
There are obstacles.

778
00:31:46,374 --> 00:31:47,407
What's that?

779
00:31:47,407 --> 00:31:48,840
- There are obstacles? / - Yes.

780
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:50,007
- That's dangerous. / - They are scattered about.

781
00:31:50,007 --> 00:31:51,974
(Who is the winner?)

782
00:31:53,774 --> 00:31:55,540
You can't be behind me.

783
00:31:55,540 --> 00:31:58,840
- No! / - You can't take the same lane.

784
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:01,307
(Seungsoo took the same lane in)

785
00:32:01,574 --> 00:32:03,540
- What's this? / - Come on.

786
00:32:03,540 --> 00:32:05,207
- He followed behind me. / - He took the wrong lane.

787
00:32:05,207 --> 00:32:07,840
- He should've taken another lane. / - What was that?

788
00:32:08,174 --> 00:32:11,007
- It was so fun. / - Yes, this was so much fun.

789
00:32:11,007 --> 00:32:12,340
This is fun.

790
00:32:12,340 --> 00:32:14,640
Seungsoo, this is much better than I expected.

791
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:16,740
- Yes, this was so much fun. / - The speed...

792
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:18,840
- It accelerated more and more. / - I was surprised.

793
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:21,307
Kids will love this.

794
00:32:21,307 --> 00:32:24,774
Anyway, the meal is on me.

795
00:32:24,774 --> 00:32:26,940
- Can't be helped. / - Thank you for dinner.

796
00:32:26,940 --> 00:32:28,874
- Well... / - Everyone, eat a lot.

797
00:32:28,874 --> 00:32:31,040
Eat as much as you want.

798
00:32:31,574 --> 00:32:32,907
Even though you got the flick,

799
00:32:32,907 --> 00:32:34,007
I should buy the drinks.

800
00:32:34,007 --> 00:32:36,474
- Thank you. You're buying. / - I ought to.

801
00:32:36,474 --> 00:32:38,274
- Right. Let's go. / - Don't you want to ride it again?

802
00:32:38,274 --> 00:32:40,474
- Yes, I wanted to. / - I wanted to keep going.

803
00:32:41,307 --> 00:32:43,774
The kids kept riding down and then going back up.

804
00:32:43,774 --> 00:32:46,274
That's the Everything Restaurant.

805
00:32:46,274 --> 00:32:48,807
You get sides with every drink you order.

806
00:32:48,807 --> 00:32:50,640
- My gosh, what's all that? / - What?

807
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:52,874
- That's what they serve. / - You get all that?

808
00:32:52,874 --> 00:32:54,674
- Yes. / - No way. They won't make money.

809
00:32:54,674 --> 00:32:56,874
That's just the start. It's really shocking.

810
00:32:56,874 --> 00:32:59,040
But you didn't order many drinks. You get that much?

811
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:00,607
- That can't be true. / - More drinks mean more food.

812
00:33:00,607 --> 00:33:04,007
- We were surprised. / - The dishes differ every day.

813
00:33:04,007 --> 00:33:06,107
- Depending on the catch. / - That's amazing.

814
00:33:06,107 --> 00:33:08,774
The locals ask the fishermen what they caught.

815
00:33:08,774 --> 00:33:11,507
- What's good? / - What they have.

816
00:33:11,507 --> 00:33:13,640
And they answer that they have everything.

817
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:15,574
That's why it's the Everything Restaurant.

818
00:33:15,574 --> 00:33:17,374
Oh, from "we have everything."

819
00:33:17,374 --> 00:33:19,074
Everything, everything, everything.

820
00:33:19,074 --> 00:33:22,407
They say that's why it's called Everything Restaurant.

821
00:33:22,407 --> 00:33:24,174
When will it be ready?

822
00:33:24,174 --> 00:33:25,274
It's coming right up.

823
00:33:25,274 --> 00:33:29,040
- We'll finally get the side dishes. / - I'm hungry.

824
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:30,207
Goodness.

825
00:33:31,607 --> 00:33:33,907
(The table is full of endless side dishes)

826
00:33:33,907 --> 00:33:35,540
The way the system works...

827
00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:38,074
- It's all raw fish. / - It's very famous.

828
00:33:38,074 --> 00:33:40,207
You pay only $30 per person.

829
00:33:40,207 --> 00:33:41,607
- $30 per person? / - Yes, $30 per person.

830
00:33:41,607 --> 00:33:46,674
If you order 3 bottles of alcohol, you get 20 dishes.

831
00:33:46,674 --> 00:33:49,440
Every time you order another bottle,

832
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:50,274
you get a bunch of other dishes.

833
00:33:50,274 --> 00:33:52,307
If you get the standard set and order more,

834
00:33:52,307 --> 00:33:54,007
you get more food.

835
00:33:55,507 --> 00:33:58,307
She put iced water in the bucket.

836
00:33:59,540 --> 00:34:00,574
Jeongcheol.

837
00:34:02,007 --> 00:34:05,474
I haven't had a beer with you in ages.

838
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:08,940
Thank you for coming all the way here.

839
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:11,374
- No, no. I should thank you. / - Thanks.

840
00:34:11,374 --> 00:34:14,540
My first glass on my first trip with you.

841
00:34:20,074 --> 00:34:23,140
(It tastes like honey)

842
00:34:24,307 --> 00:34:27,140
- Yes, this is it. / - It's just...

843
00:34:27,774 --> 00:34:29,474
- This is it. / - Yeah.

844
00:34:29,474 --> 00:34:32,140
Show us what you get?

845
00:34:32,140 --> 00:34:33,374
I don't know what to start with.

846
00:34:35,774 --> 00:34:37,574
- Sea squirt bibimbap. / - Sea squirt bibimbap?

847
00:34:37,574 --> 00:34:39,174
How is that possible?

848
00:34:39,174 --> 00:34:41,374
- Seriously. That place is no joke. / - It's a base dish.

849
00:34:41,374 --> 00:34:42,674
Tongyeong is famous for sea squirt.

850
00:34:42,674 --> 00:34:44,240
- Yes, it's famous for that. / - I love sea squirt.

851
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:45,774
They are in season now.

852
00:34:46,574 --> 00:34:47,607
It's good.

853
00:34:48,074 --> 00:34:51,107
- Sea squirt can be quite fishy. / - Exactly.

854
00:34:51,107 --> 00:34:53,440
Gosh, I can taste the ocean in my mouth.

855
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:56,374
With this dish, we already had an appetizer.

856
00:34:56,374 --> 00:34:57,440
Yeah.

857
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:58,874
When it comes to sea squirt...

858
00:34:58,874 --> 00:35:00,940
I can't believe I didn't go there.

859
00:35:00,940 --> 00:35:03,340
I don't enjoy it all too much.

860
00:35:03,340 --> 00:35:05,874
- This bibimbap is great. / - I'd go just for that.

861
00:35:05,874 --> 00:35:09,174
- It's better with bibimbap than separately. / - Right.

862
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:11,740
(It suits their tastes perfectly)

863
00:35:11,740 --> 00:35:15,240
You have to come on an empty stomach.

864
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:17,640
You'll lose out if you eat beforehand.

865
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:20,040
- How can you finish all this? / - You can't.

866
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:23,840
- The main dish hasn't been served. / - There's more?

867
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:26,874
- We'll get more dishes? / - We're just getting started.

868
00:35:26,874 --> 00:35:29,907
The main dish wasn't served yet.

869
00:35:29,907 --> 00:35:31,407
That was like a set of appetizers.

870
00:35:31,407 --> 00:35:32,840
- That was the appetizer? / - Yes.

871
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:33,907
The main dish is coming.

872
00:35:33,907 --> 00:35:35,574
- How is that possible? / - They'll start serving now.

873
00:35:35,574 --> 00:35:38,474
- That's the class of Tongyeong. / - It's not over yet?

874
00:35:38,474 --> 00:35:41,540
- There's more? / - We'll have to stack the dishes.

875
00:35:41,540 --> 00:35:43,540
- We didn't have space on our table. / - Exactly.

876
00:35:44,274 --> 00:35:46,307
It's not that we're not eating.

877
00:35:46,307 --> 00:35:48,274
It's just not reducing even though we're eating them.

878
00:35:48,274 --> 00:35:50,274
Here's another dish.

879
00:35:50,274 --> 00:35:51,740
You have to keep eating.

880
00:35:51,740 --> 00:35:56,540
Didn't she give you extra because it's Seungsoo?

881
00:35:56,540 --> 00:35:57,807
That's why we asked

882
00:35:57,807 --> 00:35:59,774
if she gave us more for the TV show.

883
00:35:59,774 --> 00:36:02,374
But if she did that, the others would complain.

884
00:36:02,374 --> 00:36:03,807
- That's right. / - That's so true.

885
00:36:03,807 --> 00:36:06,607
The raw fish is cut perfectly for drinks.

886
00:36:09,307 --> 00:36:11,407
One piece of fish for one sip of alcohol.

887
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:15,840
How is it?

888
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:20,107
Even the texture is very good.

889
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:23,240
It's so chewy.

890
00:36:24,674 --> 00:36:26,274
- Right? / - It's so chewy.

891
00:36:26,807 --> 00:36:29,474
- This tastes great. / - Exactly.

892
00:36:29,474 --> 00:36:31,340
It gets tastier the more I chew.

893
00:36:31,340 --> 00:36:33,040
The texture is great.

894
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:35,474
The more I chew, the sweeter it tastes.

895
00:36:35,474 --> 00:36:37,807
- You'd get scared to order more drinks. / - I was.

896
00:36:37,807 --> 00:36:39,007
I was scared.

897
00:36:39,007 --> 00:36:41,640
- When there are many side dishes... / - What's that?

898
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:44,174
- Cuttlefish. / - Cuttlefish?

899
00:36:44,174 --> 00:36:45,674
- That's the ink. / - It's a cuttlefish.

900
00:36:45,674 --> 00:36:47,607
- Cuttlefish. / - Gosh, that's just...

901
00:36:47,674 --> 00:36:49,074
Let me try.

902
00:36:49,074 --> 00:36:50,907
(He eats it in one go with a lot of ink)

903
00:36:52,540 --> 00:36:53,707
How is it?

904
00:36:53,707 --> 00:36:55,240
I keep saying this.

905
00:36:57,074 --> 00:36:59,007
It's the freshest.

906
00:36:59,574 --> 00:37:02,374
You have to give us a smile after eating that ink.

907
00:37:02,907 --> 00:37:05,840
- For the show. / - You're happy, right?

908
00:37:06,174 --> 00:37:07,574
- There we go. / - He did it.

909
00:37:07,574 --> 00:37:10,440
- There it is. / - He knows how it's done.

910
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:11,940
I know.

911
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:13,307
I'm getting tipsy.

912
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:18,907
The best part of traveling is this.

913
00:37:18,907 --> 00:37:20,074
- It's the delicious food. / - He became the Joker.

914
00:37:20,074 --> 00:37:22,240
- His lipstick color is pretty. / - I agree.

915
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:25,474
A trip with great food is the best.

916
00:37:26,707 --> 00:37:28,974
Enjoying great food brings so much happiness.

917
00:37:30,507 --> 00:37:38,540
(They wrap up their day as they enjoy their drinks)

918
00:37:42,207 --> 00:37:44,974
(Exciting morning of their second day in Tongyeong)

919
00:37:46,674 --> 00:37:48,907
That place is so awesome.

920
00:37:48,907 --> 00:37:53,440
(They can take a boat to Yokjido from Samdeok Port)

921
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:57,440
- It's the next day morning? / - Yes.

922
00:37:57,740 --> 00:37:59,874
We're at the port.

923
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:04,440
- You're researching again? / - Yes.

924
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:05,240
Such a researcher.

925
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:07,040
I prepared everything in advance.

926
00:38:07,740 --> 00:38:10,207
- Since it's our first trip. / - The ferry.

927
00:38:10,207 --> 00:38:12,474
I see. We can go there through the ferry terminal.

928
00:38:13,140 --> 00:38:16,474
(50 minutes by ferry from Samdeok Port to Yokjido)

929
00:38:16,474 --> 00:38:20,040
Since it takes 50 minutes, you can take rice rolls...

930
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:22,707
- Yes, you must eat on the ferry. / - You should.

931
00:38:22,707 --> 00:38:24,674
We should depart from Samdeok Port.

932
00:38:25,307 --> 00:38:27,374
To spend our day efficiently,

933
00:38:27,374 --> 00:38:29,274
we'll start from Samdeok Port.

934
00:38:29,907 --> 00:38:31,574
A person like him makes everyone comfortable.

935
00:38:31,574 --> 00:38:32,207
That's great.

936
00:38:32,207 --> 00:38:34,374
It was really convenient. It was for me.

937
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:37,274
- We get the tickets from here? / - Yes.

938
00:38:38,407 --> 00:38:41,640
We'll take the ferry at 8:30 a.m. 2 adults, please.

939
00:38:42,740 --> 00:38:44,207
Thank you. / - Thank you.

940
00:38:44,207 --> 00:38:46,707
- So you need your ID. / - You must take your ID.

941
00:38:46,707 --> 00:38:48,540
- Let's go. / - To Yokjido!

942
00:38:50,374 --> 00:38:53,040
(One Day Three Meals Tour departs for Yokjido)

943
00:38:53,407 --> 00:38:54,940
I'm excited.

944
00:38:55,007 --> 00:38:56,974
We only traveled a bit on the ferry

945
00:38:56,974 --> 00:38:59,640
but I see lots of small islands.

946
00:39:00,874 --> 00:39:03,540
- I like the smell of the sea. / - I agree.

947
00:39:03,607 --> 00:39:04,674
It's refreshing.

948
00:39:05,407 --> 00:39:09,174
(The ferry cuts through the sea and heads to Yokjido)

949
00:39:09,407 --> 00:39:10,574
(Ah)

950
00:39:12,340 --> 00:39:13,807
This is so nice.

951
00:39:14,807 --> 00:39:16,307
The inside of the ferry was amazing.

952
00:39:16,307 --> 00:39:19,107
- It must be nice inside. / - It was so comfortable.

953
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:26,907
- Wow, they're eating a lot. / - What's that?

954
00:39:26,907 --> 00:39:28,707
- Pork belly with oyster? / - What is that?

955
00:39:28,707 --> 00:39:30,974
- What's that? / - Let me explain about Yokjido.

956
00:39:31,474 --> 00:39:34,874
This region is famous for mackerel and sweet potato.

957
00:39:34,874 --> 00:39:36,540
Mackerel and sweet potato?

958
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:37,740
- Is that so? / - That's why...

959
00:39:37,740 --> 00:39:38,940
I plan to eat every dish made

960
00:39:38,940 --> 00:39:41,274
with mackerel and sweet potato.

961
00:39:41,274 --> 00:39:42,507
- Really? / - Yes.

962
00:39:42,507 --> 00:39:44,174
- I love both. / - Right?

963
00:39:44,174 --> 00:39:45,807
- Yeah. / - We eat both of them often.

964
00:39:45,807 --> 00:39:49,440
Since it's breakfast, instead of eating sashimi...

965
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:51,207
- A meal? / - How does a mackerel meal sound?

966
00:39:51,207 --> 00:39:53,674
- A mackerel meal? Okay, okay. / - Let's go.

967
00:39:56,574 --> 00:39:57,874
Hey, where are we going to eat?

968
00:39:57,874 --> 00:40:00,340
- Seungsoo, that place looks great. / - Which one?

969
00:40:00,340 --> 00:40:01,507
- Let's eat on the second floor. / - Sure, sure.

970
00:40:01,507 --> 00:40:04,040
- We can see the ocean from there. / - That's great.

971
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:05,340
Isn't that mackerel?

972
00:40:05,340 --> 00:40:07,340
They have live mackerel.

973
00:40:08,307 --> 00:40:10,774
- Those are live mackerel. / - That's so interesting.

974
00:40:10,774 --> 00:40:12,774
- I've never seen it before. / - They go in circles.

975
00:40:12,774 --> 00:40:15,074
They keep circling in the same direction.

976
00:40:16,107 --> 00:40:18,374
The colors are so distinct.

977
00:40:19,407 --> 00:40:21,707
That's how the color looks when they're fresh.

978
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:24,607
- This is intriguing. / - I've never seen live mackerel.

979
00:40:24,607 --> 00:40:26,207
Exactly. Same here.

980
00:40:26,940 --> 00:40:30,707
I heard this is the only island that can raise mackerel.

981
00:40:30,707 --> 00:40:32,007
- Raising mackerel? / - Yes.

982
00:40:33,474 --> 00:40:36,074
- They raise mackerel? / - Yes, they do.

983
00:40:36,774 --> 00:40:38,074
This is the only island that does.

984
00:40:41,074 --> 00:40:44,240
I'm getting even hungrier. Let's hurry.

985
00:40:47,374 --> 00:40:50,407
Don't you think Yokjido is a funny name?

986
00:40:50,407 --> 00:40:52,374
- It is. / - It sounds like "curse."

987
00:40:52,374 --> 00:40:55,040
I see signs that say, "Yokji post office,"

988
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:58,074
"Yokji church," "Yokji elementary school."

989
00:40:58,074 --> 00:40:59,940
Stop emphasizing the "curse" part.

990
00:40:59,940 --> 00:41:01,240
- Yokji. / - Yokji.

991
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:03,940
It's a very unique name.

992
00:41:03,940 --> 00:41:05,074
I wonder what it means.

993
00:41:05,074 --> 00:41:07,707
I got curious and I looked it up.

994
00:41:08,607 --> 00:41:10,807
In Chinese characters,

995
00:41:10,807 --> 00:41:14,640
"Yok" means to "desire"

996
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:15,940
and "Ji" means "to know."

997
00:41:16,807 --> 00:41:18,707
It's an island that gives you a desire

998
00:41:18,707 --> 00:41:20,707
to know more about it.

999
00:41:20,707 --> 00:41:22,374
That's why it's called Yokjido.

1000
00:41:22,374 --> 00:41:23,974
That's the story behind the name.

1001
00:41:23,974 --> 00:41:26,807
- That's how charming the island is. / - Exactly.

1002
00:41:26,807 --> 00:41:28,640
- It's a meaningful name. / - So Yokjido...

1003
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:30,740
- Has a different meaning. / - It does.

1004
00:41:30,740 --> 00:41:33,307
- It made the island seem different. / - I see.

1005
00:41:33,307 --> 00:41:34,140
Yokjido.

1006
00:41:38,340 --> 00:41:43,540
(The fresh mackerel is now being cooked)

1007
00:41:43,540 --> 00:41:44,907
That must be so delicious.

1008
00:41:44,907 --> 00:41:46,607
That has to be delicious.

1009
00:41:46,607 --> 00:41:49,407
Freshly caught mackerel...

1010
00:41:49,407 --> 00:41:50,640
They're really tender, right?

1011
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:51,874
I don't know how to describe it.

1012
00:41:51,874 --> 00:41:54,740
It's like, "Did mackerel always taste like this?"

1013
00:41:56,640 --> 00:42:00,340
Smelling the food makes me hungry.

1014
00:42:00,340 --> 00:42:01,540
I can smell the food.

1015
00:42:01,940 --> 00:42:03,374
- Oh, yes. / - Thank you.

1016
00:42:03,374 --> 00:42:04,874
- Hello. / - It's finally served.

1017
00:42:06,507 --> 00:42:07,540
It's finally served.

1018
00:42:07,540 --> 00:42:10,807
(Another feast is served)

1019
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:14,407
This is insane. My goodness.

1020
00:42:14,507 --> 00:42:16,707
(It's a special mackerel dish you can taste in Yokjido)

1021
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:21,140
We're going to show you a unique way to eat mackerel.

1022
00:42:21,907 --> 00:42:24,107
- Freshly caught mackerel. / - Yes.

1023
00:42:25,674 --> 00:42:28,874
You'd never dream to freeze them here, right?

1024
00:42:28,874 --> 00:42:30,174
Right.

1025
00:42:30,174 --> 00:42:31,074
If you come to Seoul,

1026
00:42:31,074 --> 00:42:35,140
I'll show you what frozen Mackerel is like.

1027
00:42:35,140 --> 00:42:36,040
Seriously.

1028
00:42:37,874 --> 00:42:38,907
Let's get started.

1029
00:42:39,774 --> 00:42:45,074
I'd like to start with the natural flavors.

1030
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:50,207
(Seungsoo takes a bite first)

1031
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:52,574
This fish right here...

1032
00:42:54,174 --> 00:42:57,240
It doesn't need anything else.

1033
00:42:57,240 --> 00:42:59,207
That's the face of someone who ate something good.

1034
00:43:00,007 --> 00:43:01,174
You have to look angry.

1035
00:43:01,874 --> 00:43:03,507
This is game over.

1036
00:43:03,507 --> 00:43:04,674
I'll try some.

1037
00:43:09,074 --> 00:43:10,140
It's game over.

1038
00:43:14,540 --> 00:43:16,074
- It must be really good. / - That's the face...

1039
00:43:16,074 --> 00:43:17,007
When you eat something really good.

1040
00:43:17,007 --> 00:43:18,674
The best mackerel of my life...

1041
00:43:19,174 --> 00:43:22,074
I shouldn't get used to this taste.

1042
00:43:22,074 --> 00:43:24,007
- Now I can't eat anything but fresh mackerel. / - Yeah.

1043
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:26,074
It's so juicy.

1044
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:31,607
In Seoul, the juice just tastes like oil.

1045
00:43:31,607 --> 00:43:34,674
But here, it doesn't just taste like oil.

1046
00:43:34,674 --> 00:43:38,274
It's real juice from the meat. You can taste it.

1047
00:43:38,274 --> 00:43:40,040
- The meat looks plump. / - I know.

1048
00:43:40,040 --> 00:43:41,874
- It has to be juicy. / - I want to eat that again.

1049
00:43:41,874 --> 00:43:42,707
I feel sad.

1050
00:43:43,007 --> 00:43:44,640
Oh, man...

1051
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:47,174
I'm sure it's harder for the two of them than for us.

1052
00:43:47,174 --> 00:43:48,107
Because we know how it tastes.

1053
00:43:48,107 --> 00:43:49,840
- You know the taste. / - I still remember it.

1054
00:43:50,274 --> 00:43:51,507
My mouth keeps watering.

1055
00:43:52,307 --> 00:43:53,274
Let me try this as well.

1056
00:43:54,040 --> 00:43:55,107
I'll dip it in the sauce.

1057
00:43:57,074 --> 00:43:59,440
The meat is plump.

1058
00:43:59,674 --> 00:44:00,574
How is it?

1059
00:44:00,574 --> 00:44:06,207
This is so good. The chef here cooks really well.

1060
00:44:06,207 --> 00:44:07,207
The sauce is good.

1061
00:44:08,507 --> 00:44:11,107
As you know, mackerel is packed with

1062
00:44:11,107 --> 00:44:12,807
vitamins and minerals.

1063
00:44:12,807 --> 00:44:15,874
- It's the most nutritious fish. / - Yes, it is.

1064
00:44:17,607 --> 00:44:18,807
Wasn't it salty?

1065
00:44:18,807 --> 00:44:20,940
- Not at all. / - It wasn't salty at all.

1066
00:44:20,940 --> 00:44:22,440
Gyeongsang-do foods are normally salty.

1067
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:24,340
But that wasn't salty at all.

1068
00:44:24,340 --> 00:44:25,574
Just that alone is tasty.

1069
00:44:26,107 --> 00:44:29,574
They gave us lettuce and cabbage.

1070
00:44:29,574 --> 00:44:31,274
I don't think there's anything that goes with lettuce.

1071
00:44:31,274 --> 00:44:33,007
I wondered why they gave us this

1072
00:44:33,007 --> 00:44:34,340
when we ordered mackerel.

1073
00:44:34,340 --> 00:44:35,640
- We're meant to eat it as a wrap. / - Like meat.

1074
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:37,907
- Wrap the fish in lettuce. / - Radish too.

1075
00:44:39,707 --> 00:44:42,607
You have to go to Yokjido to taste that.

1076
00:44:45,207 --> 00:44:46,207
It's delicious.

1077
00:44:46,207 --> 00:44:49,440
- It's similar to meat wraps. / - I know.

1078
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:50,640
This is interesting.

1079
00:44:51,574 --> 00:44:54,307
- It tastes like good meat. / - He's suddenly excited.

1080
00:44:54,940 --> 00:44:57,007
- I was really surprised. / - After tasting it?

1081
00:44:57,740 --> 00:45:00,174
I don't think you could tell it's fish if you're not told.

1082
00:45:00,440 --> 00:45:03,107
At first, I thought it wouldn't go well with lettuce

1083
00:45:03,107 --> 00:45:05,774
but now that I see how it looks, it looks delicious.

1084
00:45:06,607 --> 00:45:09,407
I've tried lots of dishes but...

1085
00:45:09,407 --> 00:45:11,774
Instead of paste, I used the pollack roe...

1086
00:45:12,474 --> 00:45:13,607
- It was fantastic. / - Pollack roe!

1087
00:45:13,607 --> 00:45:15,874
- It's a flavor you can't imagine. / - That looks so good.

1088
00:45:15,874 --> 00:45:18,607
- Pollack roe. / - We're eating so much interesting food.

1089
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:20,074
Add that here.

1090
00:45:21,540 --> 00:45:24,140
(I'm feeling good)

1091
00:45:26,840 --> 00:45:28,907
Seungsoo, you look excited.

1092
00:45:30,340 --> 00:45:32,874
(His extreme happiness makes his eyebrows dance)

1093
00:45:34,074 --> 00:45:37,274
This is a new kind of mackerel dish.

1094
00:45:37,907 --> 00:45:39,607
I love eating it with pollack roe.

1095
00:45:39,607 --> 00:45:41,140
It accentuates the flavor.

1096
00:45:41,140 --> 00:45:44,407
Are there many good mackerel restaurants in Yokjido?

1097
00:45:44,407 --> 00:45:45,774
- There are quite a few. / - There are?

1098
00:45:45,774 --> 00:45:47,774
- There are quite a few. / - The flavor changes.

1099
00:45:47,774 --> 00:45:49,107
Yeah.

1100
00:45:49,107 --> 00:45:50,974
Nothing tastes bad here.

1101
00:45:51,940 --> 00:45:54,240
I just had the best mackerel of my life in Yokjido.

1102
00:45:56,774 --> 00:45:59,140
It looks just like a cafe...

1103
00:45:59,140 --> 00:46:00,807
- That place looks like a bakery. / - I know.

1104
00:46:00,807 --> 00:46:02,874
It's such a nice atmosphere.

1105
00:46:03,507 --> 00:46:06,674
When we go outside, there's a coastal road.

1106
00:46:08,040 --> 00:46:09,774
The road goes around the island.

1107
00:46:09,774 --> 00:46:11,274
- A coastal road? / - Yes.

1108
00:46:11,274 --> 00:46:14,240
I've prepared a special convertible

1109
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:16,007
to cruise down that road.

1110
00:46:16,007 --> 00:46:17,807
- Here? It's a convertible? / - Yes.

1111
00:46:17,807 --> 00:46:20,007
It's open on all sides.

1112
00:46:20,507 --> 00:46:21,540
- Really? / - Yes.

1113
00:46:21,540 --> 00:46:22,874
I'm a bit worried now after this great meal.

1114
00:46:22,874 --> 00:46:23,774
You're worried?

1115
00:46:23,774 --> 00:46:25,107
- No? / - It's going to be very cool.

1116
00:46:25,107 --> 00:46:26,907
Okay, we need to work that out.

1117
00:46:26,907 --> 00:46:28,840
So you go on ahead, I'll eat some more first.

1118
00:46:30,540 --> 00:46:33,807
- But my legs won't move. / - They won't...

1119
00:46:34,174 --> 00:46:35,507
Can we take this to go?

1120
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:38,240
- It must be really good. / - I want to live here.

1121
00:46:39,474 --> 00:46:42,940
We're going to the place I planned for you.

1122
00:46:43,407 --> 00:46:46,274
I told you earlier. Convertible!

1123
00:46:46,274 --> 00:46:47,374
A convertible?

1124
00:46:47,374 --> 00:46:50,440
- Open in all directions? / - That's right!

1125
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:52,807
- A convertible of Yokjido? / - It's very cool car.

1126
00:46:53,374 --> 00:46:56,440
There it is.

1127
00:46:56,607 --> 00:46:57,774
Take a look.

1128
00:46:59,574 --> 00:47:01,774
- What is it? / - He might be scolded.

1129
00:47:01,774 --> 00:47:04,107
- What's that? A tricycle? / - Oh, that's a...

1130
00:47:04,107 --> 00:47:04,707
Convertible.

1131
00:47:08,007 --> 00:47:13,007
(You can rent a vehicle in Yokjido)

1132
00:47:14,074 --> 00:47:15,207
(ATV hire, $25 for 2 people)

1133
00:47:15,207 --> 00:47:17,774
- You see them on coastal roads. / - ATV!

1134
00:47:18,774 --> 00:47:20,807
- Hello. / - Hello.

1135
00:47:20,807 --> 00:47:21,674
- Hello. / - Hi.

1136
00:47:21,674 --> 00:47:24,207
We'd like to hire one.

1137
00:47:24,207 --> 00:47:25,207
How do you drive it?

1138
00:47:25,740 --> 00:47:27,740
You need to practice a bit.

1139
00:47:27,740 --> 00:47:30,240
- You need to practice? / - How do you practice?

1140
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:32,107
I'm going to drive.

1141
00:47:32,107 --> 00:47:33,774
- Would you like to drive? / - Yes.

1142
00:47:33,774 --> 00:47:34,974
- I'll sit in the back. / - Okay.

1143
00:47:34,974 --> 00:47:37,940
- I'll get one ready right away. / - Sure thing.

1144
00:47:37,940 --> 00:47:39,840
- Guys normally ride separately. / - They're lovers.

1145
00:47:42,207 --> 00:47:45,440
(There's a sitting cushion for Jeongcheol)

1146
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:49,240
(After they put on helmets, the training starts)

1147
00:47:49,907 --> 00:47:51,374
I get on...

1148
00:47:51,374 --> 00:47:52,207
Let's have just one person on for now.

1149
00:47:52,207 --> 00:47:53,840
Yes, okay.

1150
00:47:56,874 --> 00:47:58,740
- This is the brakes. / - Press the brakes.

1151
00:47:58,740 --> 00:48:01,140
Could you give me your hand?

1152
00:48:02,174 --> 00:48:03,574
(The middle-aged Park Bogum)

1153
00:48:04,940 --> 00:48:07,607
- Can I touch your hand? / - Yes, yes.

1154
00:48:08,740 --> 00:48:10,074
She touched his hand.

1155
00:48:12,740 --> 00:48:15,007
She's very polite.

1156
00:48:15,007 --> 00:48:18,374
- Can I touch your hand? / - Yes, yes.

1157
00:48:18,974 --> 00:48:21,574
(She grabs his hand)

1158
00:48:22,374 --> 00:48:24,974
You should leave the car in neutral.

1159
00:48:24,974 --> 00:48:27,340
Is this the gear? This is neutral and this is drive.

1160
00:48:27,340 --> 00:48:30,574
If you want to let it stand, press this here.

1161
00:48:30,574 --> 00:48:31,507
Like this?

1162
00:48:31,807 --> 00:48:35,107
(They even finished a practice drive)

1163
00:48:35,107 --> 00:48:36,640
Do you need a driver's license for that?

1164
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:38,207
- You need your license. / - I see.

1165
00:48:39,174 --> 00:48:42,140
One Day Three Meals Tour!

1166
00:48:42,507 --> 00:48:47,540
(They start the tour around Yokjido)

1167
00:48:51,807 --> 00:48:54,140
Riding this makes me feel like...

1168
00:48:54,140 --> 00:48:57,207
- I've become a resident of Yokjido. / - I know.

1169
00:48:58,107 --> 00:49:00,074
It'd be so fun for couples to ride that.

1170
00:49:00,074 --> 00:49:01,274
It'd be the best.

1171
00:49:01,274 --> 00:49:04,574
How about we buy some dessert on the way?

1172
00:49:04,574 --> 00:49:05,774
- Dessert? / - Yes.

1173
00:49:05,774 --> 00:49:06,607
Do they sell dessert here?

1174
00:49:06,607 --> 00:49:10,707
There's a dessert place run by senior citizens.

1175
00:49:10,707 --> 00:49:12,340
- Senior citizens? / - Yes.

1176
00:49:12,340 --> 00:49:13,240
We must go there.

1177
00:49:13,774 --> 00:49:14,840
Okay, okay.

1178
00:49:14,840 --> 00:49:16,740
It's a place with a special dessert.

1179
00:49:18,007 --> 00:49:19,374
So this is the place.

1180
00:49:19,940 --> 00:49:21,240
Hello.

1181
00:49:23,874 --> 00:49:27,140
(Senior citizens took barista courses to run this place)

1182
00:49:27,140 --> 00:49:29,140
It's so beautiful.

1183
00:49:30,007 --> 00:49:31,674
Sweet potato latte is tasty.

1184
00:49:31,674 --> 00:49:33,240
That machine is imported

1185
00:49:33,240 --> 00:49:36,440
but the pitcher is a traditionally Korean pail.

1186
00:49:37,240 --> 00:49:41,840
(You can have various sweet potato desserts)

1187
00:49:44,274 --> 00:49:47,574
(Jeongcheol ordered sweet potato latte)

1188
00:49:48,474 --> 00:49:51,374
Excuse me, ma'am.

1189
00:49:52,107 --> 00:49:53,607
We brought tumblers.

1190
00:49:53,607 --> 00:49:56,040
Please give us the latte in these.

1191
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:01,540
- Sweet potato latte. / - It looks delicious.

1192
00:50:02,574 --> 00:50:03,907
- Thank you. / - Thank you.

1193
00:50:04,274 --> 00:50:05,640
- Thank you for the drink. / - Thank you for the drink.

1194
00:50:06,174 --> 00:50:07,874
- Stay healthy. / - Bye.

1195
00:50:09,007 --> 00:50:10,107
Go, go.

1196
00:50:10,574 --> 00:50:12,040
Go, go!

1197
00:50:12,040 --> 00:50:14,974
I feel good to have something delicious now.

1198
00:50:14,974 --> 00:50:15,907
I know.

1199
00:50:15,907 --> 00:50:17,474
Let's go, Seungsoo!

1200
00:50:17,474 --> 00:50:19,940
- Let's go. / - Where are you going now?

1201
00:50:20,107 --> 00:50:21,607
A place with an incredible view.

1202
00:50:21,607 --> 00:50:23,274
If you drive along the coastal road,

1203
00:50:23,274 --> 00:50:24,607
there's a photo spot there.

1204
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:27,440
We'll go this way.

1205
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:35,740
(They can see the amazing view of Yokjido)

1206
00:50:37,474 --> 00:50:38,807
It looks amazing.

1207
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:42,240
This really is a coastal road.

1208
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:48,374
(Yokjido has nice breezes and plenty to see)

1209
00:50:49,607 --> 00:50:51,540
Seungsoo, let's stop over here.

1210
00:50:51,540 --> 00:50:53,674
- The view here is great. / - Let's take a break here.

1211
00:50:54,740 --> 00:50:55,640
This place is awesome.

1212
00:50:56,207 --> 00:50:57,674
Oh, my. What a great location.

1213
00:50:57,674 --> 00:50:59,540
The view from there was fantastic.

1214
00:51:00,874 --> 00:51:02,807
I didn't know how beautiful Korea was.

1215
00:51:03,374 --> 00:51:04,974
It's just like Italy.

1216
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:13,174
You have to enjoy that view with bare eyes.

1217
00:51:13,174 --> 00:51:14,707
It makes all your stress go away.

1218
00:51:19,007 --> 00:51:19,940
Check out the rocks.

1219
00:51:19,940 --> 00:51:21,640
Goodness, look at the color of the water.

1220
00:51:24,540 --> 00:51:27,240
This sea looks so exotic.

1221
00:51:28,140 --> 00:51:29,440
What a view.

1222
00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:33,707
It's different from the East Sea.

1223
00:51:33,707 --> 00:51:36,040
I'm not sure since I haven't been to the South a lot.

1224
00:51:36,040 --> 00:51:38,107
I really experienced what it was like on this trip.

1225
00:51:38,107 --> 00:51:39,907
It's really marvelous.

1226
00:51:39,907 --> 00:51:42,474
It is marvelous

1227
00:51:42,474 --> 00:51:44,240
but for some strange reason...

1228
00:51:46,107 --> 00:51:48,740
I'm hungry despite the fact that we just ate.

1229
00:51:48,740 --> 00:51:49,740
You're hungry, right?

1230
00:51:49,740 --> 00:51:51,574
You digest well here.

1231
00:51:51,940 --> 00:51:53,607
I'm digesting food quickly now.

1232
00:51:54,207 --> 00:51:55,474
It must circulate well.

1233
00:51:56,740 --> 00:51:59,807
The dessert we bought earlier...

1234
00:51:59,807 --> 00:52:01,107
Let's eat that.

1235
00:52:01,107 --> 00:52:03,274
- We should eat it with this view. / - Let's eat it here.

1236
00:52:04,574 --> 00:52:05,774
- Seriously. / - This is the best.

1237
00:52:05,774 --> 00:52:07,840
- Should we sit there and eat? / - Yes.

1238
00:52:07,840 --> 00:52:08,674
This is a nice spot.

1239
00:52:08,674 --> 00:52:11,240
It's a bit embarrassing but let's sit next to each other.

1240
00:52:11,240 --> 00:52:12,507
You sat side by side?

1241
00:52:13,607 --> 00:52:16,807
It'd be so funny if it ended with a confession of love.

1242
00:52:17,140 --> 00:52:18,407
- A happy ending? / - Yes.

1243
00:52:19,540 --> 00:52:21,274
I wouldn't mind any kind of romance...

1244
00:52:22,174 --> 00:52:26,574
(They have a sip of the sweet potato latte)

1245
00:52:27,540 --> 00:52:30,874
It tastes magical.

1246
00:52:31,274 --> 00:52:34,040
Lately, I make baby food, right?

1247
00:52:34,040 --> 00:52:37,374
- Yeah! / - This tastes similar to that.

1248
00:52:37,374 --> 00:52:38,674
It really does.

1249
00:52:38,674 --> 00:52:40,407
Kids will love this.

1250
00:52:40,407 --> 00:52:43,007
I said this on the way here.

1251
00:52:43,007 --> 00:52:47,240
But if I ended up meeting someone here,

1252
00:52:47,240 --> 00:52:49,940
I think I'd love that woman with all my heart.

1253
00:52:51,940 --> 00:52:54,107
- Do you want to get married? / - Of course.

1254
00:52:54,107 --> 00:52:55,674
- Really? / - Yes.

1255
00:52:55,940 --> 00:52:58,507
That's what I always tell you. Please.

1256
00:52:58,507 --> 00:53:00,307
If you just hold hands

1257
00:53:00,307 --> 00:53:04,240
and do a lap of the island, love will blossom.

1258
00:53:04,240 --> 00:53:06,974
(At that moment, tour vehicles pass behind them)

1259
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:11,440
(I guess they're here to sightsee)

1260
00:53:11,940 --> 00:53:13,174
I know him!

1261
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:16,074
Yes, hello.

1262
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:18,840
Did you not bring your kids here?

1263
00:53:18,840 --> 00:53:22,974
My kids aren't born yet.

1264
00:53:22,974 --> 00:53:24,474
- They think you're married. / - Yes.

1265
00:53:24,474 --> 00:53:26,607
They see you as the character from your drama.

1266
00:53:26,607 --> 00:53:27,640
Yes, yes.

1267
00:53:28,274 --> 00:53:32,174
(I'm still a bachelor)

1268
00:53:32,174 --> 00:53:33,007
Seungsoo.

1269
00:53:34,940 --> 00:53:35,974
Did you enjoy it?

1270
00:53:38,107 --> 00:53:40,974
- Let's remember this tasty time. / - Okay.

1271
00:53:40,974 --> 00:53:44,007
- There's a place we must visit. / - Another?

1272
00:53:44,007 --> 00:53:45,974
- It's a must-see place in Yokjido. / - Really?

1273
00:53:45,974 --> 00:53:47,407
There's a place better than here?

1274
00:53:47,407 --> 00:53:49,207
You haven't been to Yokjido unless you go there.

1275
00:53:49,207 --> 00:53:51,540
- If you recommend it that strongly... / - We must go.

1276
00:53:51,540 --> 00:53:53,807
Yeah. But I really love this place.

1277
00:53:53,807 --> 00:53:55,940
Let's save this place in our hearts and get going.

1278
00:53:56,774 --> 00:53:57,740
- It will be amazing. / - This is...

1279
00:53:57,740 --> 00:54:00,340
- I should do what youngsters do. / - What is it?

1280
00:54:00,940 --> 00:54:04,107
Saved it in my heart.

1281
00:54:05,774 --> 00:54:07,774
- Youngsters do that these days? / - Yes.

1282
00:54:08,674 --> 00:54:11,040
Saved in my heart!

1283
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:13,340
- Saved... / - Saved...

1284
00:54:13,340 --> 00:54:14,107
That was a bit slow.

1285
00:54:14,440 --> 00:54:16,007
- "Saved." / - It was very slow.

1286
00:54:16,007 --> 00:54:17,907
- "Saved." / - Very slow.

1287
00:54:17,907 --> 00:54:20,140
- They didn't save it. / - Very slow.

1288
00:54:20,140 --> 00:54:21,907
Saved it in my heart.

1289
00:54:25,507 --> 00:54:28,074
Tourist attractions in Yokjido.

1290
00:54:28,074 --> 00:54:30,240
This looks fun. The suspension bridge.

1291
00:54:32,274 --> 00:54:33,640
I love those.

1292
00:54:34,974 --> 00:54:37,940
Can Seungsoo handle this?

1293
00:54:41,207 --> 00:54:45,107
(10 minutes by ATV from observatory to the bridge)

1294
00:54:45,107 --> 00:54:46,074
- Is this the place? / - Yes.

1295
00:54:46,607 --> 00:54:48,274
- Okay. / - If we take a short walk...

1296
00:54:49,974 --> 00:54:50,907
We'll be there.

1297
00:54:52,040 --> 00:54:53,474
The view here is nice too.

1298
00:54:53,740 --> 00:54:57,540
So this place has a view as good as before?

1299
00:54:57,774 --> 00:54:59,074
- This is special. / - Yeah?

1300
00:54:59,074 --> 00:55:01,940
It's really special. You must cross that bridge.

1301
00:55:02,174 --> 00:55:05,240
Having a guardian like him made the trip so good.

1302
00:55:05,240 --> 00:55:07,774
- Guardian? / - He's your guardian?

1303
00:55:07,774 --> 00:55:10,874
I just had to go wherever he led me.

1304
00:55:10,874 --> 00:55:13,307
But you need someone like Seungsoo

1305
00:55:13,307 --> 00:55:15,274
who doesn't prepare anything and just follows.

1306
00:55:15,274 --> 00:55:16,707
If both people prepare things...

1307
00:55:16,707 --> 00:55:19,174
- You clash. / - That's right.

1308
00:55:19,174 --> 00:55:20,040
It's not just a regular bridge.

1309
00:55:20,407 --> 00:55:22,307
Is it a bridge of no return?

1310
00:55:22,307 --> 00:55:24,107
You're not scared of heights, right?

1311
00:55:24,340 --> 00:55:26,374
There it is. That's the suspension bridge, Seungsoo.

1312
00:55:26,374 --> 00:55:27,874
You saw that, right? The suspension bridge.

1313
00:55:27,874 --> 00:55:29,374
- A suspension bridge? / - The name gives it away.

1314
00:55:29,374 --> 00:55:32,140
- It looks like Jeju-do. / - Yes.

1315
00:55:32,140 --> 00:55:33,974
I don't know how much the bridge will move.

1316
00:55:33,974 --> 00:55:35,140
I have a bad feeling.

1317
00:55:36,307 --> 00:55:37,807
- There it is. / - I can see it.

1318
00:55:39,040 --> 00:55:41,574
(Wow)

1319
00:55:42,207 --> 00:55:43,674
It actually moves.

1320
00:55:46,574 --> 00:55:47,674
That looks like fun.

1321
00:55:48,940 --> 00:55:50,607
The view here was so...

1322
00:55:50,607 --> 00:55:52,340
Wow, that's amazing.

1323
00:55:52,340 --> 00:55:58,474
(Bridge above water that connects to the observatory)

1324
00:55:59,474 --> 00:56:01,107
- Will you be okay? / - What's that down there?

1325
00:56:03,407 --> 00:56:03,974
Down there...

1326
00:56:05,907 --> 00:56:07,140
It's quite high.

1327
00:56:07,140 --> 00:56:08,840
The bridge wasn't long but it was really high.

1328
00:56:08,840 --> 00:56:09,974
Weren't you scared?

1329
00:56:09,974 --> 00:56:11,307
I was scared a bit.

1330
00:56:14,307 --> 00:56:16,507
It really is a suspension bridge.

1331
00:56:19,274 --> 00:56:22,107
(Giggling)

1332
00:56:24,574 --> 00:56:26,307
Amazing. Hold on a second.

1333
00:56:27,274 --> 00:56:28,740
Amazing.

1334
00:56:28,740 --> 00:56:30,307
He's jumping. He's jumping behind Jeongcheol.

1335
00:56:30,307 --> 00:56:32,240
- There he is. / - He's jumping.

1336
00:56:33,707 --> 00:56:37,540
The charm of the bridge comes from this movement.

1337
00:56:39,474 --> 00:56:41,740
(This is fun)

1338
00:56:42,107 --> 00:56:43,307
Hey, it looks amazing here.

1339
00:56:43,774 --> 00:56:45,874
- Let's take a photo here. / - Yes. Wow, here...

1340
00:56:47,840 --> 00:56:49,607
What a fantastic view.

1341
00:56:51,374 --> 00:56:52,407
Those views are breath-taking.

1342
00:56:55,474 --> 00:56:56,574
This is nice.

1343
00:56:56,740 --> 00:56:58,274
So refreshing.

1344
00:56:58,274 --> 00:57:00,674
(I'll take a photo of Seungsoo)

1345
00:57:01,774 --> 00:57:03,540
- I'll take it. / - Okay.

1346
00:57:05,407 --> 00:57:09,607
(Shaking suspension bridge with beautiful scenery)

1347
00:57:09,607 --> 00:57:12,940
One Day Three Meals Tour!

1348
00:57:12,940 --> 00:57:15,340
(A fun memory at the suspension bridge)

1349
00:57:18,540 --> 00:57:21,407
- Let's return the ATV and go. / - Sure. Okay.

1350
00:57:22,540 --> 00:57:24,340
You have to hire an ATV there.

1351
00:57:24,340 --> 00:57:25,340
There's so much you can do with it.

1352
00:57:25,340 --> 00:57:27,040
The ATV provides its own enjoyment.

1353
00:57:29,540 --> 00:57:31,374
(They reach the drop-off point at 3 p.m.)

1354
00:57:31,374 --> 00:57:32,340
We have arrived.

1355
00:57:33,007 --> 00:57:35,574
- Did you have fun? / - Yes, it was great.

1356
00:57:35,574 --> 00:57:36,874
- We had so much fun. / - I see.

1357
00:57:37,774 --> 00:57:39,107
Can I ask you a question?

1358
00:57:39,107 --> 00:57:40,607
- Sure. / - Who's the opposing team?

1359
00:57:41,374 --> 00:57:43,307
Cho Janghyuck...

1360
00:57:43,307 --> 00:57:45,474
- Cho Janghyuck? / - Yes, Cho Janghyuck.

1361
00:57:45,474 --> 00:57:47,440
And Singer Kim Hyunchul.

1362
00:57:48,407 --> 00:57:51,507
(Two middle-aged men are leisurely enjoying life)

1363
00:57:51,507 --> 00:57:52,507
Cho Janghyuck?

1364
00:57:52,507 --> 00:57:54,274
What is going on there?

1365
00:57:54,274 --> 00:57:55,974
We have to win, right?

1366
00:57:55,974 --> 00:57:58,274
- We must win. / - We must win. I think we'll win.

1367
00:57:58,274 --> 00:58:00,640
We have this sweet potato rice wine here in Yokjido.

1368
00:58:01,207 --> 00:58:03,440
- Sweet potato rice wine. / - Rice wine!

1369
00:58:03,440 --> 00:58:05,840
Sweet potato rice wine and raw mackerel.

1370
00:58:05,840 --> 00:58:08,007
If you have that, I think you can win.

1371
00:58:08,940 --> 00:58:10,107
(A highly recommended combination)

1372
00:58:10,107 --> 00:58:12,840
Fish with strong flavors go well with rice wine.

1373
00:58:13,407 --> 00:58:15,907
- Is it nearby? / - Yes, right here.

1374
00:58:16,974 --> 00:58:19,507
- This is a powerful one. / - It's an ultimate.

1375
00:58:19,507 --> 00:58:21,874
You must beat Cho Janghyuck.

1376
00:58:21,874 --> 00:58:23,207
As the representatives?

1377
00:58:23,207 --> 00:58:25,007
Do you have something against Janghyuck?

1378
00:58:25,007 --> 00:58:27,540
No, I like him.

1379
00:58:27,540 --> 00:58:28,540
You like him?

1380
00:58:31,174 --> 00:58:33,040
- I'll have to visit Yokjido. / - Yeah.

1381
00:58:33,040 --> 00:58:34,307
I'd better go to her to hire the ATV.

1382
00:58:35,040 --> 00:58:36,874
- Then are you using us? / - No.

1383
00:58:36,874 --> 00:58:39,707
- I'm just a fan. I'm his fan. / - You're a fan.

1384
00:58:39,707 --> 00:58:42,474
- But you still want us to win? / - Of course.

1385
00:58:42,974 --> 00:58:44,740
- Thank you. / - Not at all.

1386
00:58:44,740 --> 00:58:45,507
Here we are.

1387
00:58:46,774 --> 00:58:47,807
Sweet potato rice wine.

1388
00:58:47,807 --> 00:58:49,040
Sweet potato rice wine from Yokjido.

1389
00:58:49,040 --> 00:58:52,074
They're here to buy the rice wine

1390
00:58:52,074 --> 00:58:53,740
- Hello. / - Hello.

1391
00:58:58,040 --> 00:58:59,407
This is the sweet potato rice wine?

1392
00:59:00,940 --> 00:59:03,574
(That looks good)

1393
00:59:03,574 --> 00:59:05,207
It looks like the chestnut rice wine.

1394
00:59:05,974 --> 00:59:08,307
The rice wine isn't bottled? It's stored just like that?

1395
00:59:08,307 --> 00:59:10,240
It means they makes it from scratch.

1396
00:59:11,640 --> 00:59:12,740
With yeast?

1397
00:59:13,474 --> 00:59:15,640
- You harvested them yourself? / - Come and try this.

1398
00:59:15,640 --> 00:59:17,007
Sure, sure.

1399
00:59:19,240 --> 00:59:20,007
- Cheers. / - Cheers.

1400
00:59:20,007 --> 00:59:21,507
To our victory!

1401
00:59:25,074 --> 00:59:28,540
(They have a cup of cool rice wine)

1402
00:59:28,840 --> 00:59:31,374
- You can't really taste the alcohol. / - Yeah, it's good.

1403
00:59:31,774 --> 00:59:34,940
We used to drink it as a snack.

1404
00:59:35,607 --> 00:59:37,674
We didn't have a lot of food back then.

1405
00:59:37,674 --> 00:59:40,840
So we brewed a lot of rice wine.

1406
00:59:40,840 --> 00:59:42,440
If you drink this, you won't feel hungry.

1407
00:59:44,774 --> 00:59:47,307
- It's $5 per bottle. / - $5...

1408
00:59:49,007 --> 00:59:51,474
(The second place the ATV lady recommended)

1409
00:59:51,474 --> 00:59:52,640
Jeongcheol, here...

1410
00:59:53,307 --> 00:59:54,974
I see the cart bar she told us about.

1411
00:59:54,974 --> 00:59:57,407
- The live mackerel is here. / - It's here.

1412
00:59:57,407 --> 01:00:00,307
- Right. I think this is the place. / - We can eat there.

1413
01:00:01,007 --> 01:00:02,474
It's just mackerel everywhere.

1414
01:00:02,474 --> 01:00:03,574
It's just a cart bar by the sea.

1415
01:00:03,574 --> 01:00:04,674
They're so common there.

1416
01:00:04,674 --> 01:00:05,974
It's really rare here.

1417
01:00:05,974 --> 01:00:07,274
- Hello. / - Hi.

1418
01:00:07,274 --> 01:00:08,974
- Let's go in. / - Come in.

1419
01:00:11,740 --> 01:00:17,007
(Fresh mackerel in Yokjido are raised here)

1420
01:00:19,107 --> 01:00:24,474
(You can taste fresh, raw mackerel here)

1421
01:00:26,474 --> 01:00:30,174
($30 per plate, 2 fish)

1422
01:00:30,174 --> 01:00:34,374
We finally get to eat raw mackerel by the ocean.

1423
01:00:34,374 --> 01:00:36,540
I can't believe they sell mackerel at a cart bar.

1424
01:00:38,540 --> 01:00:40,540
Seungsoo, check this out.

1425
01:00:41,607 --> 01:00:43,707
I don't know how this will look on screen.

1426
01:00:43,707 --> 01:00:44,874
It's like a painting.

1427
01:00:46,140 --> 01:00:48,340
This is a scene you dream about.

1428
01:00:48,340 --> 01:00:52,274
- Sitting by the sea like this. / - I love this stillness.

1429
01:00:52,274 --> 01:00:53,640
The wind is nice and cool.

1430
01:00:54,440 --> 01:00:57,107
Seungsoo, it's already past 4 p.m.

1431
01:00:57,107 --> 01:00:57,974
Our ferry is at 4:30 p.m.

1432
01:00:57,974 --> 01:01:00,007
The final ferry departs at 4:30 p.m.?

1433
01:01:00,607 --> 01:01:02,207
Yes, there was one at 4:30.

1434
01:01:02,207 --> 01:01:03,807
We were meant to hurry and move.

1435
01:01:03,807 --> 01:01:05,540
I'd just stay there.

1436
01:01:05,540 --> 01:01:07,074
- That's our last ferry? / - Yes.

1437
01:01:07,074 --> 01:01:09,274
We have no time.

1438
01:01:09,274 --> 01:01:11,074
- We're in a hurry. / - They need to bring it out fast.

1439
01:01:11,074 --> 01:01:13,907
Please add it in with CG.

1440
01:01:13,907 --> 01:01:16,307
Let's pretend we have raw mackerel and eat.

1441
01:01:17,107 --> 01:01:20,007
Fresh mackerel is brought out.

1442
01:01:22,640 --> 01:01:26,307
They just filleted it, so it looks so lustrous.

1443
01:01:26,940 --> 01:01:28,007
It's juicy.

1444
01:01:30,140 --> 01:01:32,740
- It's not fishy. / - It's not fishy at all.

1445
01:01:33,340 --> 01:01:35,207
Of course not. We didn't eat anything.

1446
01:01:36,574 --> 01:01:38,674
I thought it was real. You're such a great actor.

1447
01:01:41,907 --> 01:01:44,607
- Here it comes. / - Thank you.

1448
01:01:47,807 --> 01:01:50,940
The true color of an oily fish.

1449
01:01:52,674 --> 01:01:54,407
- The color is really pretty. / - Yes.

1450
01:01:54,407 --> 01:01:57,474
- It looks delicious. / - We'll have a drink.

1451
01:01:58,274 --> 01:02:00,707
I wonder what the sweet potato rice wine tastes like.

1452
01:02:03,540 --> 01:02:05,807
I can barely taste the alcohol.

1453
01:02:05,807 --> 01:02:07,274
If you didn't mention it...

1454
01:02:07,274 --> 01:02:08,807
They'd think it was non-alcoholic.

1455
01:02:08,807 --> 01:02:10,340
It has really low alcohol content.

1456
01:02:10,340 --> 01:02:11,907
- It does? / - Really low.

1457
01:02:11,907 --> 01:02:13,340
Then I can drink it too.

1458
01:02:13,340 --> 01:02:17,274
Have a piece of this and a sip of rice wine.

1459
01:02:20,140 --> 01:02:21,374
Try it as it is.

1460
01:02:23,707 --> 01:02:25,274
It's good, right?

1461
01:02:25,807 --> 01:02:28,674
That's fascinating. It's a very light taste.

1462
01:02:29,340 --> 01:02:32,707
- It's just savory. / - It really is savory.

1463
01:02:32,707 --> 01:02:35,507
- It's the best mackerel I've had. / - Yes.

1464
01:02:35,507 --> 01:02:37,940
- Isn't it too greasy? / - Not at all.

1465
01:02:37,940 --> 01:02:39,907
- Not fishy at all. / - It's fascinating.

1466
01:02:39,907 --> 01:02:43,574
Having it with the rice wine is the delicacy.

1467
01:02:43,574 --> 01:02:47,140
You drink this and it's like you didn't eat the fish.

1468
01:02:47,140 --> 01:02:48,307
It cleans your palette.

1469
01:02:48,307 --> 01:02:49,874
I could drink this forever.

1470
01:02:51,174 --> 01:02:56,607
(It's time to eat endlessly)

1471
01:02:58,374 --> 01:02:59,640
Did they add something to this?

1472
01:03:03,974 --> 01:03:05,907
- I feel like mackerel all of a sudden. / - I know.

1473
01:03:05,907 --> 01:03:07,207
Don't they sell it anywhere?

1474
01:03:07,207 --> 01:03:09,407
Yokjido is the place to have raw mackerel.

1475
01:03:10,774 --> 01:03:12,440
- It's almost time. / - We have to go now.

1476
01:03:12,440 --> 01:03:14,540
Everything was a success in Yokjido.

1477
01:03:15,474 --> 01:03:18,907
- They ate it all. / - They cleaned out their plates.

1478
01:03:18,907 --> 01:03:20,707
- Let's go. / - Let's go.

1479
01:03:23,607 --> 01:03:26,174
- Hey, hurry up. / - Is the boat still there?

1480
01:03:26,174 --> 01:03:27,574
- What happened? / - What?

1481
01:03:29,240 --> 01:03:30,807
I think it's closed.

1482
01:03:31,507 --> 01:03:33,574
- Seungsoo. / - Did you miss the last boat?

1483
01:03:33,574 --> 01:03:35,507
- There was an incident. / - It's locked.

1484
01:03:37,107 --> 01:03:39,107
No, it can't be.

1485
01:03:41,074 --> 01:03:42,174
(There goes the last boat)

1486
01:03:42,174 --> 01:03:43,740
That was the last boat.

1487
01:03:44,607 --> 01:03:46,307
That was the last boat.

1488
01:03:46,940 --> 01:03:49,374
(There goes the last boat)

1489
01:03:50,474 --> 01:03:52,440
What should we do?

1490
01:03:52,640 --> 01:03:56,540
(He can't believe this situation)

1491
01:03:56,540 --> 01:03:58,107
(How can you laugh about this?)

1492
01:03:58,440 --> 01:04:02,574
Seungsoo, I'm sorry. This...

1493
01:04:03,140 --> 01:04:07,640
- There is no boat until tomorrow. / - Goodness.

1494
01:04:08,040 --> 01:04:10,540
The first boat departing Yokjido is at 8 a.m.

1495
01:04:11,440 --> 01:04:14,907
What should we do? What do we do?

1496
01:04:14,907 --> 01:04:16,074
What do we do?

1497
01:04:16,440 --> 01:04:20,074
Seungsoo, this is destiny.

1498
01:04:20,074 --> 01:04:21,874
- No way. / - This is destiny.

1499
01:04:21,874 --> 01:04:23,940
We need to sleep here tonight.

1500
01:04:24,640 --> 01:04:26,640
That sounded strange.

1501
01:04:27,540 --> 01:04:28,707
Why are you crying?

1502
01:04:30,907 --> 01:04:34,507
- Hello, ma'am. I have a question. / - Hello.

1503
01:04:34,507 --> 01:04:37,907
We just missed the 4:35 p.m. boat.

1504
01:04:37,907 --> 01:04:41,607
Aren't there anymore that go to Tongyeong?

1505
01:04:41,607 --> 01:04:45,674
There are, on that side.

1506
01:04:45,674 --> 01:04:46,974
- Where? / - Where?

1507
01:04:46,974 --> 01:04:49,007
- Over there. / - On the other side?

1508
01:04:49,007 --> 01:04:51,974
- Are there more boats there? / - I see.

1509
01:04:51,974 --> 01:04:53,674
Thank you so much.

1510
01:04:56,140 --> 01:04:57,807
- Are there two docks? / - Yes.

1511
01:04:57,807 --> 01:04:59,507
- There it is. / - Thank goodness.

1512
01:04:59,507 --> 01:05:00,674
It's at 5:50 p.m.

1513
01:05:00,674 --> 01:05:03,574
There are ships that leave at later times.

1514
01:05:03,574 --> 01:05:04,340
5:50 p.m.

1515
01:05:04,340 --> 01:05:05,707
You have plenty of time.

1516
01:05:05,707 --> 01:05:08,040
- Thank goodness. / - Seriously.

1517
01:05:08,040 --> 01:05:09,840
- There's always hope. / - You're right.

1518
01:05:09,840 --> 01:05:11,640
There's always a way.

1519
01:05:11,640 --> 01:05:13,374
Let's go on that boat.

1520
01:05:13,374 --> 01:05:15,674
- Let's go! / - Yes, let's go.

1521
01:05:19,007 --> 01:05:20,740
(They go back to Tongyeong safely)

1522
01:05:20,740 --> 01:05:23,074
Did you sleep in Tongyeong on the first night?

1523
01:05:23,074 --> 01:05:25,640
Yes, we did. Then we went to Yokjido.

1524
01:05:25,640 --> 01:05:26,907
Then we went back to Tongyeong.

1525
01:05:26,907 --> 01:05:28,540
You have something left to do in Tongyeong?

1526
01:05:28,540 --> 01:05:30,807
- It's the highlight, the oysters. / - That's the best.

1527
01:05:31,474 --> 01:05:34,507
That's right. This is the first time you're having oyster.

1528
01:05:34,507 --> 01:05:35,907
- That's right. / - It's the first time.

1529
01:05:35,907 --> 01:05:39,707
(30 minutes from Samdeok Port to oyster pork belly)

1530
01:05:39,707 --> 01:05:43,507
It's not the oyster season in Tongyeong.

1531
01:05:43,507 --> 01:05:46,674
So not many restaurants serve oyster course meals.

1532
01:05:46,674 --> 01:05:50,707
I think the last part of the journey has to be great,

1533
01:05:50,707 --> 01:05:54,874
so I can say that we had a successful trip.

1534
01:05:54,874 --> 01:05:56,207
They're oyster dishes

1535
01:05:56,207 --> 01:05:58,140
that we've never tried before.

1536
01:05:58,140 --> 01:05:59,674
They serve them in a course meal.

1537
01:06:00,374 --> 01:06:01,640
Really? Are you sure?

1538
01:06:02,540 --> 01:06:05,640
- It's the best cooked oyster dish. / - Okay.

1539
01:06:05,640 --> 01:06:06,940
- Let's go. / - Okay. Let's go.

1540
01:06:06,940 --> 01:06:09,407
- No need for explanation. Let's go. / - Okay.

1541
01:06:09,407 --> 01:06:11,407
- Check it out yourself. / - Just go for it.

1542
01:06:11,407 --> 01:06:12,707
I am curious.

1543
01:06:12,707 --> 01:06:14,307
It's not oyster season but

1544
01:06:14,307 --> 01:06:16,007
you can have this oyster dish.

1545
01:06:16,007 --> 01:06:18,007
You can eat it all year round.

1546
01:06:19,874 --> 01:06:23,040
You really prepared a lot beforehand.

1547
01:06:23,274 --> 01:06:24,640
King of preparation.

1548
01:06:24,640 --> 01:06:27,107
You can taste various oyster dishes.

1549
01:06:27,107 --> 01:06:29,707
I think you'll be satisfied with most of them.

1550
01:06:29,707 --> 01:06:32,074
Yes. I'm also wondering,

1551
01:06:32,074 --> 01:06:35,240
"Are there a lot of different oyster dishes?"

1552
01:06:35,240 --> 01:06:37,240
I know oyster fritters.

1553
01:06:37,240 --> 01:06:39,840
Right. What you usually see is oyster in fritters.

1554
01:06:39,840 --> 01:06:42,507
- Oyster soup. That's about it. / - Right.

1555
01:06:42,507 --> 01:06:45,074
- I have a reason for coming here. / - What is it?

1556
01:06:46,040 --> 01:06:49,607
They serve a dish that beats all the other dishes.

1557
01:06:49,607 --> 01:06:53,307
I've never even imagined this kind of combination.

1558
01:06:53,307 --> 01:06:55,107
- Is that right? / - I think...

1559
01:06:55,107 --> 01:06:58,340
We'll win because of this dish.

1560
01:06:58,340 --> 01:07:00,207
- This is the winner. / - I think it is.

1561
01:07:00,207 --> 01:07:02,040
The owner of this restaurant

1562
01:07:02,040 --> 01:07:04,640
made a lot of oyster dishes

1563
01:07:04,640 --> 01:07:08,074
for those who can't eat raw oysters.

1564
01:07:08,074 --> 01:07:11,374
She serves dishes that she came up with.

1565
01:07:11,374 --> 01:07:12,874
That... What?

1566
01:07:13,607 --> 01:07:15,340
It's interesting. I've only heard of it.

1567
01:07:15,340 --> 01:07:17,974
- She's bringing something. / - Why do we need this?

1568
01:07:17,974 --> 01:07:21,240
(A gas burner?)

1569
01:07:21,240 --> 01:07:24,074
- Why do we need this? / - Exactly. Do we cook...

1570
01:07:24,940 --> 01:07:25,807
What is this?

1571
01:07:27,307 --> 01:07:28,507
What is this?

1572
01:07:28,940 --> 01:07:32,174
I've only seen this in pictures.

1573
01:07:34,040 --> 01:07:36,407
(Pork belly and oysters)

1574
01:07:37,207 --> 01:07:38,974
(Awesome)

1575
01:07:38,974 --> 01:07:39,740
That's...

1576
01:07:39,740 --> 01:07:41,874
- What is that? / - That's thin pork belly.

1577
01:07:41,874 --> 01:07:43,207
- What is this? / - What is that?

1578
01:07:43,207 --> 01:07:46,174
Thin pork belly, oysters and seasoned bean sprouts.

1579
01:07:46,174 --> 01:07:49,107
Such a dish exists?

1580
01:07:49,107 --> 01:07:50,207
I was shocked too.

1581
01:07:50,207 --> 01:07:51,974
Look how plump the oysters are.

1582
01:07:51,974 --> 01:07:54,474
As soon as you serve that...

1583
01:07:54,474 --> 01:07:56,840
- This combination... / - Exactly.

1584
01:07:56,840 --> 01:07:59,307
- Could this be... / - I can't trust this combination.

1585
01:07:59,307 --> 01:08:01,574
- Let's try something else first. / - Yes.

1586
01:08:01,574 --> 01:08:03,974
Try the other dishes while it's cooking.

1587
01:08:03,974 --> 01:08:07,540
(There's a variety of other dishes as well)

1588
01:08:08,440 --> 01:08:10,640
(Oyster course meal is $30 per person)

1589
01:08:12,540 --> 01:08:14,107
Shall we try the most familiar one?

1590
01:08:14,107 --> 01:08:16,274
Yes, I'll do it.

1591
01:08:16,274 --> 01:08:18,040
That's the real oyster.

1592
01:08:22,874 --> 01:08:23,674
- Is it good? / - Yes.

1593
01:08:23,674 --> 01:08:27,307
They catch the oysters fresh.

1594
01:08:27,907 --> 01:08:30,940
So they're really plump. You can see how plump.

1595
01:08:30,940 --> 01:08:32,807
- They're really fresh. / - I love oyster.

1596
01:08:32,807 --> 01:08:33,874
That's like a real health food.

1597
01:08:33,874 --> 01:08:35,540
Isn't this your first oyster pork belly?

1598
01:08:35,540 --> 01:08:37,974
Yes. We were so surprised.

1599
01:08:40,140 --> 01:08:42,340
This oyster is so fresh.

1600
01:08:43,540 --> 01:08:46,007
- This too. / - Seasoned oyster.

1601
01:08:46,007 --> 01:08:47,107
Yes, seasoned oyster in pepper paste and vinegar.

1602
01:08:48,707 --> 01:08:50,407
(Jeongcheol takes a bite)

1603
01:08:54,740 --> 01:08:57,474
It's good. It's sweet and sour.

1604
01:08:58,040 --> 01:09:01,174
Will you be okay with that?

1605
01:09:02,007 --> 01:09:03,774
Why do you keep smacking your lips?

1606
01:09:04,474 --> 01:09:06,440
Why do you keep smacking your lips?

1607
01:09:06,440 --> 01:09:08,407
- Wait till you see ours. / - Okay.

1608
01:09:08,407 --> 01:09:10,407
It just looks too good.

1609
01:09:10,407 --> 01:09:12,307
We'll watch yours next week.

1610
01:09:12,307 --> 01:09:14,640
The oyster season is over.

1611
01:09:14,640 --> 01:09:16,640
Did you harvest them recently?

1612
01:09:16,640 --> 01:09:20,474
In Tongyeong, we harvest oysters all year long.

1613
01:09:20,474 --> 01:09:23,440
When the weather is warm, we eat them cooked.

1614
01:09:24,774 --> 01:09:27,307
So you harvest them all year,

1615
01:09:27,307 --> 01:09:29,874
but you cook them because the weather is warm.

1616
01:09:29,874 --> 01:09:31,707
- Since you can't eat it raw. / - I see.

1617
01:09:31,707 --> 01:09:34,340
- The oysters are very plump. / - They are.

1618
01:09:34,340 --> 01:09:37,507
- They can't be if they were frozen. / - Right.

1619
01:09:38,640 --> 01:09:40,740
(Finally they try the grilled oyster dish)

1620
01:09:40,740 --> 01:09:42,107
How does it taste?

1621
01:09:42,107 --> 01:09:44,074
You can't tell before you eat.

1622
01:09:44,074 --> 01:09:46,440
We weren't sure about that combination.

1623
01:09:46,440 --> 01:09:47,840
- That combination. / - It's driving me crazy.

1624
01:09:47,840 --> 01:09:49,640
That's seriously cheating.

1625
01:09:49,640 --> 01:09:52,107
It's all cooking in that pork grease.

1626
01:09:54,140 --> 01:09:56,274
What about this?

1627
01:09:56,874 --> 01:09:59,707
So what's the combination? The pork belly and...

1628
01:09:59,707 --> 01:10:03,407
The meat, vegetables and oyster wrapped in lettuce.

1629
01:10:03,407 --> 01:10:04,740
With soybean paste or pepper and vinegar?

1630
01:10:04,740 --> 01:10:06,840
- Eat it with soybean paste. / - Just bean paste.

1631
01:10:07,507 --> 01:10:11,074
(It's a delicious wrap)

1632
01:10:11,074 --> 01:10:14,240
You had really great meals in Tongyeong.

1633
01:10:14,240 --> 01:10:16,507
- Seriously. / - How does it taste?

1634
01:10:16,507 --> 01:10:17,540
His expression is?

1635
01:10:19,040 --> 01:10:22,240
This is interesting. Towards the end...

1636
01:10:23,607 --> 01:10:24,907
It hits you.

1637
01:10:25,407 --> 01:10:26,140
- It's unexpected? / - Yeah.

1638
01:10:26,140 --> 01:10:27,374
I'll try some.

1639
01:10:31,407 --> 01:10:34,274
You need to chew for a while to taste the aroma.

1640
01:10:34,974 --> 01:10:38,740
At first, I taste the pork.

1641
01:10:38,740 --> 01:10:40,240
- Yes, the pork belly. / - That's what I taste.

1642
01:10:40,240 --> 01:10:42,407
Then midway through,

1643
01:10:42,407 --> 01:10:44,740
you can taste the oyster.

1644
01:10:44,740 --> 01:10:46,174
That'd be so good.

1645
01:10:47,240 --> 01:10:49,840
It has too many different tastes.

1646
01:10:49,840 --> 01:10:50,740
Was it too confusing?

1647
01:10:50,740 --> 01:10:54,040
You can't say it's confusing. You should rather say

1648
01:10:54,040 --> 01:10:55,807
it's entrancing.

1649
01:10:56,040 --> 01:10:59,274
I could feel so many different tastes at the same time.

1650
01:10:59,274 --> 01:11:00,640
I was busy savoring all of them.

1651
01:11:00,640 --> 01:11:03,340
It gets rid of the bad smell of pork.

1652
01:11:03,340 --> 01:11:07,007
I know. The more I chew, the more flavor I get.

1653
01:11:07,007 --> 01:11:08,574
This is amazing.

1654
01:11:10,674 --> 01:11:13,407
It changed my perceptions of oysters.

1655
01:11:13,707 --> 01:11:15,374
We must eat a lot of this.

1656
01:11:15,740 --> 01:11:19,074
(A strange combination of an oyster and pork)

1657
01:11:22,107 --> 01:11:25,874
It feels peculiar but charming.

1658
01:11:29,974 --> 01:11:33,340
(Charming)

1659
01:11:35,007 --> 01:11:35,774
(You have to taste it yourself)

1660
01:11:35,774 --> 01:11:38,640
- They're eating a lot. / - Do you go on a diet?

1661
01:11:38,640 --> 01:11:41,240
A diet? I had no thought of it that day.

1662
01:11:41,240 --> 01:11:43,407
- That day. / - There was no tomorrow.

1663
01:11:44,674 --> 01:11:46,474
That's how we feel when we eat something good.

1664
01:11:46,774 --> 01:11:48,474
There should be no tomorrow when you eat that.

1665
01:11:48,774 --> 01:11:51,307
I ate that last bite and...

1666
01:11:51,307 --> 01:11:52,940
The oyster and pork parted to different sides

1667
01:11:52,940 --> 01:11:53,874
of my mouth.

1668
01:11:53,874 --> 01:11:57,240
I had oyster in here and pork in here.

1669
01:11:58,240 --> 01:11:59,940
This tastes good and so does this

1670
01:11:59,940 --> 01:12:02,774
and when they meet in the middle, it's so good.

1671
01:12:02,774 --> 01:12:04,507
It's a different taste when they mix, right?

1672
01:12:05,074 --> 01:12:06,407
This is strange.

1673
01:12:10,174 --> 01:12:11,374
What was your favorite?

1674
01:12:12,074 --> 01:12:15,307
We went to so many restaurants

1675
01:12:15,307 --> 01:12:17,840
but there wasn't a single restaurant that I didn't like.

1676
01:12:17,840 --> 01:12:18,707
I know.

1677
01:12:18,707 --> 01:12:22,940
We had three meals and even dessert and snacks.

1678
01:12:22,940 --> 01:12:25,140
I'll never forget the set meal

1679
01:12:25,140 --> 01:12:27,574
with the endless serving of food.

1680
01:12:27,574 --> 01:12:31,640
The grilled fresh mackerel.

1681
01:12:31,640 --> 01:12:32,874
And the braised dish...

1682
01:12:33,874 --> 01:12:36,574
I feel bad about picking a favorite.

1683
01:12:37,074 --> 01:12:40,540
What stuck in my mind

1684
01:12:40,540 --> 01:12:42,507
in a short period of time

1685
01:12:42,507 --> 01:12:44,707
is this pork belly with oyster.

1686
01:12:45,740 --> 01:12:48,874
I want to cook it myself

1687
01:12:48,874 --> 01:12:51,007
after I go back to Seoul.

1688
01:12:51,307 --> 01:12:54,440
There has been nothing bad the whole day.

1689
01:12:54,440 --> 01:12:55,807
Thank you, Jeongcheol.

1690
01:12:56,040 --> 01:12:59,974
Thank you for the three meals for today.

1691
01:13:01,107 --> 01:13:04,240
One Day Three Meals Tour!

1692
01:13:06,007 --> 01:13:08,540
(One Day Three Meals Tour to the domestic island)

1693
01:13:08,540 --> 01:13:10,874
- I think you gained weight. / - I gained a lot of weight.

1694
01:13:11,540 --> 01:13:12,740
You can see the difference.

1695
01:13:12,740 --> 01:13:14,440
- He gained weight. / - You can see it.

1696
01:13:14,440 --> 01:13:15,640
You did eat a lot.

1697
01:13:15,640 --> 01:13:17,474
It was a proper eating show.

1698
01:13:17,474 --> 01:13:21,474
I thought three meals a day weren't enough at first.

1699
01:13:21,474 --> 01:13:24,740
But they had such abundant meals.

1700
01:13:24,740 --> 01:13:25,607
What did you say?

1701
01:13:25,607 --> 01:13:28,274
I think it's a rediscovery of Yokjido.

1702
01:13:28,274 --> 01:13:31,440
When you see Ulleungdo, you want to go there.

1703
01:13:31,440 --> 01:13:32,640
I didn't know much about Yokjido

1704
01:13:32,640 --> 01:13:35,074
but I want to go there now.

1705
01:13:35,074 --> 01:13:37,007
I think I must go there at least once in my life.

1706
01:13:37,007 --> 01:13:39,140
The mackerel was so good...

1707
01:13:39,140 --> 01:13:41,807
And I want to know more about Yokjido.

1708
01:13:41,807 --> 01:13:44,807
Raw mackerel looked so good

1709
01:13:44,807 --> 01:13:46,374
but I don't like to drink.

1710
01:13:46,374 --> 01:13:49,174
However, I really want to try sweet potato rice wine.

1711
01:13:49,174 --> 01:13:51,974
- Women would like it. / - Can I get it in Seoul?

1712
01:13:51,974 --> 01:13:55,874
All the dishes we had on Yokjido...

1713
01:13:55,874 --> 01:13:57,474
I don't think I've ever seen them in Seoul.

1714
01:13:57,474 --> 01:13:59,407
They make it at home.

1715
01:13:59,407 --> 01:14:00,540
Yes, they make it in their homes.

1716
01:14:00,540 --> 01:14:02,674
So the alcohol content varies.

1717
01:14:02,674 --> 01:14:04,240
But it's lower in alcohol proof than regular rice wine.

1718
01:14:04,240 --> 01:14:08,640
Much lower. You can really gulp it down.

1719
01:14:08,640 --> 01:14:10,040
I really want to try it.

1720
01:14:10,040 --> 01:14:13,007
That's good. You can drink until the last ship leaves.

1721
01:14:14,674 --> 01:14:16,407
Let's check the cost now.

1722
01:14:16,407 --> 01:14:17,574
How much did they spend?

1723
01:14:17,574 --> 01:14:18,707
They ate a lot.

1724
01:14:18,707 --> 01:14:20,674
Each meal cost at least $30 per person.

1725
01:14:20,674 --> 01:14:22,474
They were set meals.

1726
01:14:22,474 --> 01:14:25,740
Seungsoo, how much did you spend?

1727
01:14:26,074 --> 01:14:29,407
- Excluding transportation expenses... / - Yes.

1728
01:14:30,140 --> 01:14:32,474
We spent $190.70.

1729
01:14:32,774 --> 01:14:34,174
- Per person? / - Per person?

1730
01:14:34,307 --> 01:14:35,540
For 2 days.

1731
01:14:35,540 --> 01:14:37,674
- It's less than $200. / - If it's less than $200...

1732
01:14:37,674 --> 01:14:39,707
- With all that food. / - For 2 days...

1733
01:14:39,707 --> 01:14:41,374
