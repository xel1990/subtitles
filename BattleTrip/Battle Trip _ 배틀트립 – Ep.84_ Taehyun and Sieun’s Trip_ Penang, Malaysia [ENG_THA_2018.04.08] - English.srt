Reset Tour! ♪ Turn it all back ♪

2
00:00:03,077 --> 00:00:04,344
What's the reason we came here?

3
00:00:04,344 --> 00:00:04,910
Photo of a lifetime.

4
00:00:04,910 --> 00:00:06,010
The photos look really great.

5
00:00:06,010 --> 00:00:07,777
A romantic couple's trip.

6
00:00:07,777 --> 00:00:10,110
This was a dream of mine.

7
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:12,144
A surge of romantic love.

8
00:00:12,144 --> 00:00:14,477
You were really beautiful.

9
00:00:14,477 --> 00:00:16,844
Will you marry me in your next life?

10
00:00:18,110 --> 00:00:18,944
I love you.

11
00:00:19,244 --> 00:00:20,410
It was a success.

12
00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:21,344
Congratulations.

13
00:00:21,744 --> 00:00:25,010
(How did they plan the Penang trip?)

14
00:00:25,677 --> 00:00:27,777
For married couples, trips are wars of love.

15
00:00:27,777 --> 00:00:30,277
Battle Trip!

16
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:32,844
Last week, it really was

17
00:00:32,844 --> 00:00:34,477
a love that's like war.

18
00:00:34,477 --> 00:00:36,944
- That's right. / - A very happy war.

19
00:00:36,944 --> 00:00:39,744
Sia will join us as our host this week as well.

20
00:00:39,744 --> 00:00:42,344
Last week's episode was quite romantic, wasn't it?

21
00:00:42,344 --> 00:00:44,110
I'll be honest with you.

22
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:45,444
Throughout my marriage,

23
00:00:45,444 --> 00:00:47,577
I thought that I had met a great husband.

24
00:00:47,577 --> 00:00:49,510
He's very good to me.

25
00:00:49,510 --> 00:00:51,444
But when I saw how Dongseok treats Jiyoon,

26
00:00:51,444 --> 00:00:54,210
I realized my husband has a long way to go.

27
00:00:54,710 --> 00:00:56,577
Has he ever shed tears after

28
00:00:56,577 --> 00:00:58,344
realizing how much he loves you?

29
00:00:58,344 --> 00:00:59,444
No, he has not.

30
00:00:59,444 --> 00:01:00,777
He has never cried in front of me.

31
00:01:00,777 --> 00:01:02,344
He didn't even cry when I delivered our child.

32
00:01:02,344 --> 00:01:04,344
I was a bit disappointed about it.

33
00:01:05,377 --> 00:01:07,077
I really thought he was so cool.

34
00:01:07,077 --> 00:01:08,077
- Korea's model husband. / - Seriously.

35
00:01:08,077 --> 00:01:09,410
- You won over everyone. / - Last week was...

36
00:01:09,410 --> 00:01:12,010
Choi Dongseok's special.

37
00:01:12,010 --> 00:01:14,177
Sieun, why don't you compliment your husband too?

38
00:01:14,177 --> 00:01:15,144
Brag about him.

39
00:01:15,144 --> 00:01:16,210
Brag about your husband.

40
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:18,144
Taehyun is good at doing house chores.

41
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:20,310
- Before I got married... / - That's the best.

42
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:22,844
I'd never done laundry before.

43
00:01:22,844 --> 00:01:24,444
I didn't know how to do it.

44
00:01:24,444 --> 00:01:25,877
When my mom went away...

45
00:01:25,877 --> 00:01:26,744
While I was at work,

46
00:01:26,744 --> 00:01:28,477
he came to my house and did the laundry for me.

47
00:01:28,477 --> 00:01:30,277
Like a genie.

48
00:01:30,277 --> 00:01:32,677
Taehyun does all the cleaning and laundry at home.

49
00:01:32,677 --> 00:01:34,677
And I do the cooking.

50
00:01:34,677 --> 00:01:35,844
- That's amazing. / - He's so cool.

51
00:01:35,844 --> 00:01:36,444
You divide your chores.

52
00:01:36,444 --> 00:01:39,477
This week, we will watch

53
00:01:39,477 --> 00:01:40,644
Taehyun and Sieun's trip.

54
00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:43,577
I heard this is your first time traveling together.

55
00:01:43,577 --> 00:01:45,477
For your honeymoon, you went to volunteer.

56
00:01:45,477 --> 00:01:46,644
That's right.

57
00:01:46,644 --> 00:01:48,710
When we got married,

58
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:52,944
we wanted our honeymoon to be meaningful.

59
00:01:52,944 --> 00:01:54,610
So we went to an orphanage in Jeju-do

60
00:01:54,610 --> 00:01:56,477
to spend time with the children.

61
00:01:56,477 --> 00:01:58,677
We never got to go on a real honeymoon.

62
00:01:58,677 --> 00:02:01,444
We have never gone on a trip together as a couple.

63
00:02:01,444 --> 00:02:02,977
Jiyoon and Dongseok,

64
00:02:02,977 --> 00:02:04,344
where did you two go for your honeymoon?

65
00:02:04,344 --> 00:02:05,377
We went to a few places.

66
00:02:05,377 --> 00:02:06,410
- We did... / - Really?

67
00:02:06,410 --> 00:02:08,444
- A three-city tour. / - Where?

68
00:02:08,444 --> 00:02:09,710
We went to Singapore,

69
00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:11,777
Hong Kong and Macao.

70
00:02:11,777 --> 00:02:13,044
Great course.

71
00:02:13,044 --> 00:02:13,910
That must have been nice.

72
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:15,844
What about you, Sia? Where did you go?

73
00:02:15,844 --> 00:02:17,744
We went to Ko Samui.

74
00:02:17,744 --> 00:02:20,610
- Ko Samui. / - We went snorkeling.

75
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:23,310
My husband told me that a fish

76
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:24,744
with a thorn poked his foot.

77
00:02:24,744 --> 00:02:25,877
But...

78
00:02:25,877 --> 00:02:27,610
I thought he looked fine.

79
00:02:27,610 --> 00:02:30,610
But he thought his foot was swollen and paralyzed.

80
00:02:30,610 --> 00:02:33,077
He made such a fuss.

81
00:02:33,077 --> 00:02:35,277
I was so turned off by that.

82
00:02:35,944 --> 00:02:36,977
- For me... / - On your honeymoon?

83
00:02:36,977 --> 00:02:39,344
I married my husband because I fell for his...

84
00:02:39,344 --> 00:02:41,910
- Maturity and reliability. / - Manliness...

85
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:43,677
He acted like a baby.

86
00:02:43,677 --> 00:02:46,110
I can't forget about that incident.

87
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:48,277
Honeymoon destinations change with each generation.

88
00:02:48,277 --> 00:02:49,444
Back in the days,

89
00:02:49,444 --> 00:02:51,077
going abroad wasn't as easy as it is now.

90
00:02:51,077 --> 00:02:51,944
- Most people... / - Bugok Hawaii.

91
00:02:51,944 --> 00:02:53,310
- The elders... / - Went to Jeju-do often.

92
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:56,044
They'd visit hot springs or visit Jeju-do.

93
00:02:56,044 --> 00:02:57,210
But it's different now.

94
00:02:57,210 --> 00:02:58,610
Things in the 1990s and 2000s...

95
00:02:58,610 --> 00:03:01,077
- The 20th and 21st centuries are different. / - Right.

96
00:03:01,077 --> 00:03:02,810
The 90s are separated into before and after

97
00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:03,644
the Asian Financial Crisis.

98
00:03:03,644 --> 00:03:05,377
They were truly tough times.

99
00:03:05,377 --> 00:03:08,444
Before the Crisis, honeymoons focused on tourism.

100
00:03:08,444 --> 00:03:09,977
People went to Phuket, Thailand.

101
00:03:09,977 --> 00:03:10,910
Guam or Saipan.

102
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:12,477
- Places where you can take lots of photos. / - Right.

103
00:03:12,477 --> 00:03:14,044
Malaysia, Bali...

104
00:03:14,044 --> 00:03:15,344
They went to such places.

105
00:03:15,344 --> 00:03:16,710
But after the Crisis, people went on...

106
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:20,010
- Domestic honeymoons. / - That's right.

107
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:21,944
This is when people started going to Jeju-do a lot.

108
00:03:21,944 --> 00:03:23,977
- Jeju-do is great. / - It's awesome.

109
00:03:23,977 --> 00:03:24,944
In the 2000s,

110
00:03:24,944 --> 00:03:26,644
people started to spend more on honeymoons

111
00:03:26,644 --> 00:03:27,977
to make the most of the opportunity.

112
00:03:27,977 --> 00:03:29,477
That's when they started going to Europe.

113
00:03:29,477 --> 00:03:31,344
Or even Las Vegas.

114
00:03:31,344 --> 00:03:33,377
They'd enjoy the sightseeing and have time to relax.

115
00:03:33,377 --> 00:03:34,810
A place they can do everything.

116
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:35,744
It's changed.

117
00:03:35,744 --> 00:03:37,977
- The trends keep changing. / - They keep changing.

118
00:03:37,977 --> 00:03:40,344
If that's the trend...

119
00:03:40,344 --> 00:03:42,377
Penang, which was our destination,

120
00:03:42,377 --> 00:03:44,810
will attract a lot of couples after this show.

121
00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:45,710
Is it a memorable place?

122
00:03:45,710 --> 00:03:47,277
It's so...

123
00:03:47,277 --> 00:03:49,910
It's a place where

124
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:52,044
many cultures come together.

125
00:03:52,044 --> 00:03:52,744
I love those places.

126
00:03:52,744 --> 00:03:53,477
There's Europe.

127
00:03:53,477 --> 00:03:54,810
- Yes, Europe. / - And Southeast Asia.

128
00:03:54,810 --> 00:03:56,844
And vacation areas too.

129
00:03:56,844 --> 00:03:57,644
- Vacation areas too. / - Yes.

130
00:03:57,644 --> 00:03:59,977
You can enjoy sports in the ocean.

131
00:03:59,977 --> 00:04:01,944
It's great for things like that.

132
00:04:01,944 --> 00:04:04,010
We don't know much about Penang.

133
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:06,810
Not many know that Penang is in Malaysia.

134
00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:07,477
That's right.

135
00:04:07,477 --> 00:04:10,010
Well, a picture is worth a thousand words.

136
00:04:10,010 --> 00:04:11,177
We'll have to head there.

137
00:04:11,177 --> 00:04:12,544
Let's go there now.

138
00:04:12,544 --> 00:04:15,077
I wonder what these two...

139
00:04:15,077 --> 00:04:17,777
What kind of cringy things they did.

140
00:04:17,777 --> 00:04:19,377
I bet it became a real honeymoon

141
00:04:19,377 --> 00:04:20,410
once the cameras were off.

142
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:21,210
Yes.

143
00:04:21,210 --> 00:04:23,277
Seriously, for us...

144
00:04:23,277 --> 00:04:26,177
It really felt like a honeymoon.

145
00:04:26,177 --> 00:04:27,010
- What's wrong with him? / - What? What?

146
00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:28,177
- What? / - Sikyung, why are you crying?

147
00:04:28,177 --> 00:04:29,477
- Wait, Sung Sikyung. / - Nothing, nothing.

148
00:04:30,377 --> 00:04:31,344
- I'm embarrassed. / - Sikyung.

149
00:04:31,344 --> 00:04:32,977
- Sikyung keeps crying. / - What's wrong with you?

150
00:04:32,977 --> 00:04:34,277
- No, nothing. / - You're 40 now.

151
00:04:34,910 --> 00:04:37,877
It must be time for Sikyung to go.

152
00:04:37,877 --> 00:04:38,777
He keeps...

153
00:04:38,777 --> 00:04:40,277
- We'll watch the footage. / - He gets excited.

154
00:04:40,277 --> 00:04:42,610
Sounds weird saying it's time for him to go.

155
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:45,310
- Go where? / - Get married.

156
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:46,044
Get married?

157
00:04:46,044 --> 00:04:47,410
You should say it like that then.

158
00:04:47,410 --> 00:04:49,477
- Time to go. / - It sounds weird otherwise.

159
00:04:49,477 --> 00:04:51,044
It's time for him to get married.

160
00:04:51,044 --> 00:04:53,010
- That's right. / - Time for him to go.

161
00:04:53,010 --> 00:04:54,810
Let's check it out.

162
00:04:57,644 --> 00:05:00,510
(Like last week, they will watch the clip separately)

163
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:02,410
(It's time for the Penang trip!)

164
00:05:02,944 --> 00:05:04,510
Let's do a throwback to the 80s.

165
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:06,644
- I don't know about the 80s. / - Remember that?

166
00:05:06,644 --> 00:05:08,810
After we take turns to talk...

167
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:10,477
- You want us to do it together? / - And ask for favor.

168
00:05:10,477 --> 00:05:11,877
It looks like they are dating.

169
00:05:11,877 --> 00:05:13,244
- They are still newlyweds. / - Yes...

170
00:05:13,244 --> 00:05:14,410
Hello, we are...

171
00:05:14,410 --> 00:05:15,544
They still look fresh.

172
00:05:15,544 --> 00:05:18,044
Still newlyweds, right?

173
00:05:18,044 --> 00:05:18,944
Yes, we are.

174
00:05:18,944 --> 00:05:20,244
We're like newlyweds

175
00:05:20,244 --> 00:05:22,544
but have been married for 3 years.

176
00:05:22,544 --> 00:05:24,377
- I'm Park Sieun. / - I'm Zin Taehyun.

177
00:05:24,377 --> 00:05:26,177
- It's nice to see you. / - Hello.

178
00:05:26,177 --> 00:05:28,377
- Nice to see you. / - They are different.

179
00:05:28,377 --> 00:05:31,210
- 3 years. / - They seem so fresh.

180
00:05:31,210 --> 00:05:32,744
It does feel slightly different.

181
00:05:32,744 --> 00:05:34,844
- Slightly different. / - They're quite different.

182
00:05:35,944 --> 00:05:39,210
It won't be over with a simple resignation.

183
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:40,677
Do you understand?

184
00:05:40,677 --> 00:05:42,544
Hey, I want to buy that.

185
00:05:42,544 --> 00:05:43,977
He's like a kid.

186
00:05:43,977 --> 00:05:44,810
Goodness.

187
00:05:47,177 --> 00:05:47,977
Don't do that.

188
00:05:47,977 --> 00:05:49,577
Please don't do that.

189
00:05:50,944 --> 00:05:51,910
Coconut ice cream.

190
00:05:51,910 --> 00:05:53,377
We get to see things like this.

191
00:05:54,944 --> 00:05:56,544
- That looks cute. / - I want to be fed too.

192
00:05:56,544 --> 00:05:57,244
Try some.

193
00:05:57,244 --> 00:05:59,010
I think you know how to handle your husband.

194
00:05:59,010 --> 00:06:00,044
I do?

195
00:06:00,977 --> 00:06:03,010
Honey, this is honestly too hard.

196
00:06:04,744 --> 00:06:06,344
- You were wrong, right? / - I was wrong.

197
00:06:07,477 --> 00:06:08,610
It's going down.

198
00:06:08,610 --> 00:06:09,377
Seriously...

199
00:06:09,377 --> 00:06:10,410
It's going down.

200
00:06:11,144 --> 00:06:14,477
(They're still working out their differences)

201
00:06:14,877 --> 00:06:18,477
(But they're a lovely couple with great chemistry)

202
00:06:20,044 --> 00:06:23,210
I took some time off.

203
00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:25,010
Then on the first drama

204
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:27,577
I did after my comeback...

205
00:06:27,577 --> 00:06:29,544
- Taehyun was the lead. / - I remember this drama.

206
00:06:29,544 --> 00:06:31,477
- And I was a supporting actress. / - So cute.

207
00:06:31,477 --> 00:06:33,110
- You really met in a drama. / - He came to me...

208
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:35,110
And said, "I've always been your fan, ma'am."

209
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:36,377
He came and said that...

210
00:06:36,377 --> 00:06:39,644
- With everyone around. / - She's your senior?

211
00:06:39,644 --> 00:06:41,044
In 2001...

212
00:06:41,044 --> 00:06:41,877
She's older too?

213
00:06:41,877 --> 00:06:43,610
- Yes, by 1 year. / - I was an open recruit actor.

214
00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:45,477
At MBC.

215
00:06:45,477 --> 00:06:47,710
She was the lead...

216
00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:48,977
- The lead and a minor role. / - Of a drama.

217
00:06:48,977 --> 00:06:50,944
I had a minor role in it.

218
00:06:50,944 --> 00:06:53,610
- It's like a movie. / - She was really pretty then.

219
00:06:53,610 --> 00:06:56,144
I was shocked in my young age.

220
00:06:56,144 --> 00:06:57,610
Shocked that such a pretty girl existed.

221
00:06:57,610 --> 00:06:59,110
I'm sorry. No, but wait a minute...

222
00:06:59,110 --> 00:06:59,977
I'm sorry.

223
00:06:59,977 --> 00:07:01,777
- Goodness. / - Oh, no.

224
00:07:02,910 --> 00:07:04,644
- That's so... / - What's going on?

225
00:07:04,644 --> 00:07:05,777
That's just wrong.

226
00:07:05,777 --> 00:07:07,210
I don't go that far.

227
00:07:07,210 --> 00:07:08,677
- Don't do things like this. / - I don't.

228
00:07:08,677 --> 00:07:10,210
I don't think that's right.

229
00:07:10,210 --> 00:07:11,710
Let's see what you did in Penang.

230
00:07:11,710 --> 00:07:12,977
No, no, that's...

231
00:07:12,977 --> 00:07:14,277
That's a bit too...

232
00:07:15,677 --> 00:07:16,344
Wait, for me...

233
00:07:16,344 --> 00:07:18,644
You shouldn't have criticized him last week.

234
00:07:18,644 --> 00:07:20,077
Let me start with an apology.

235
00:07:20,077 --> 00:07:22,144
I feel a lot less guilty now.

236
00:07:22,577 --> 00:07:24,210
We met in that drama

237
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:25,710
and she was exactly the same.

238
00:07:25,710 --> 00:07:28,110
Things started working out

239
00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:29,444
and I got her number.

240
00:07:30,077 --> 00:07:32,477
I worked hard and chased her around.

241
00:07:33,544 --> 00:07:35,910
We wanted to go to Southeast Asia

242
00:07:35,910 --> 00:07:37,177
so we researched.

243
00:07:37,177 --> 00:07:39,377
Recently, my sister... She lived for 5 years...

244
00:07:40,144 --> 00:07:41,744
In Malaysia.

245
00:07:41,744 --> 00:07:42,477
My second eldest sister.

246
00:07:42,477 --> 00:07:44,344
So I asked her.

247
00:07:44,344 --> 00:07:47,344
She said there's a place called Penang in Malaysia

248
00:07:47,344 --> 00:07:50,110
and that she'd been there for a holiday.

249
00:07:50,110 --> 00:07:51,910
When I was just researching about it, it looked so fun.

250
00:07:51,910 --> 00:07:53,244
There were a lot of things to talk about.

251
00:07:54,010 --> 00:07:56,310
This is the first trip we've been on alone.

252
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:58,244
That's why I was really excited.

253
00:07:59,744 --> 00:08:00,744
Is this Penang?

254
00:08:00,744 --> 00:08:01,977
- Yes, yes. / - What's this?

255
00:08:01,977 --> 00:08:04,144
- It looks like Seoul. / - It's a city.

256
00:08:04,144 --> 00:08:05,810
It's more of a city than a vacation spot.

257
00:08:05,810 --> 00:08:06,677
No, no, no.

258
00:08:06,677 --> 00:08:08,077
No, no!

259
00:08:08,077 --> 00:08:09,144
- Come on. / - No, no.

260
00:08:10,444 --> 00:08:13,877
(Thrilling activities)

261
00:08:13,877 --> 00:08:15,444
You need the activities.

262
00:08:16,177 --> 00:08:17,244
Oh, goodness.

263
00:08:17,244 --> 00:08:18,377
That looks good.

264
00:08:18,377 --> 00:08:20,010
- That's amazing. / - I like this.

265
00:08:20,010 --> 00:08:21,644
I could eat these two every day.

266
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:23,210
It's good.

267
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:24,710
It's really good.

268
00:08:25,610 --> 00:08:26,477
It's good we came.

269
00:08:27,144 --> 00:08:28,177
With my wife.

270
00:08:28,177 --> 00:08:30,177
Oh, My Honey.

271
00:08:32,777 --> 00:08:34,344
He's planned a surprise too.

272
00:08:35,410 --> 00:08:36,544
What the? My goodness.

273
00:08:38,177 --> 00:08:39,710
Compared to Jiyoon's trip...

274
00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:40,844
You didn't have things like this.

275
00:08:40,844 --> 00:08:42,877
This is worse than last week.

276
00:08:43,877 --> 00:08:45,777
No, no. I'm sorry.

277
00:08:45,777 --> 00:08:46,210
Wait a minute.

278
00:08:46,210 --> 00:08:47,044
Was I like this?

279
00:08:47,044 --> 00:08:48,544
Wait, don't leave!

280
00:08:48,544 --> 00:08:49,477
Did I do that?

281
00:08:49,477 --> 00:08:50,610
I'm sorry.

282
00:08:52,510 --> 00:08:53,577
Tour name.

283
00:08:53,577 --> 00:08:54,777
- Team name. / - Your tour name.

284
00:08:57,477 --> 00:08:59,677
- We're the lively Park and Zin couple. / - Yeah.

285
00:08:59,677 --> 00:09:00,877
Park, Zin.

286
00:09:00,877 --> 00:09:03,677
On tour with the lively Park and Zin couple.

287
00:09:03,677 --> 00:09:05,810
- Oh, Park and Zin. / - Lively Park and Zin Tour.

288
00:09:05,810 --> 00:09:06,777
That's a good name.

289
00:09:06,777 --> 00:09:08,110
We want to move each other.

290
00:09:08,944 --> 00:09:09,877
Thankful Tour.

291
00:09:09,877 --> 00:09:11,277
We're thankful for each other.

292
00:09:14,010 --> 00:09:15,177
We monitor each other.

293
00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:18,410
We're thankful for each other.

294
00:09:18,410 --> 00:09:19,710
He said monitor.

295
00:09:20,210 --> 00:09:21,810
He's a bit of a jokester.

296
00:09:21,810 --> 00:09:23,477
He fools around a lot.

297
00:09:23,477 --> 00:09:25,410
- Park Sieun. / - And Zin Taehyun's...

298
00:09:25,410 --> 00:09:27,010
Touching Tour.

299
00:09:27,010 --> 00:09:29,044
Lively Park and Zin Tour.

300
00:09:29,044 --> 00:09:31,044
That's a great name.

301
00:09:33,710 --> 00:09:35,510
- So your sister recommended it. / - Yes.

302
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:37,544
I hadn't heard about it before.

303
00:09:37,544 --> 00:09:40,077
If it's recommended by a local, it must be good.

304
00:09:40,077 --> 00:09:42,610
I decided where we're going.

305
00:09:42,610 --> 00:09:43,910
Where?

306
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:45,877
Kapitan Keling Mosque.

307
00:09:48,010 --> 00:09:49,877
St. George's Church.

308
00:09:50,710 --> 00:09:51,477
Come here.

309
00:09:52,310 --> 00:09:53,510
Come over here now.

310
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:54,510
Wait.

311
00:09:55,844 --> 00:09:58,410
Just keep searching quietly.

312
00:09:58,410 --> 00:09:59,544
Were you upset?

313
00:09:59,544 --> 00:10:02,110
I was working on something but he kept calling me.

314
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:04,744
Penang is pretty small.

315
00:10:06,077 --> 00:10:07,377
What's that thing that flies in the sky?

316
00:10:07,377 --> 00:10:08,910
She wants to do something weird.

317
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:13,477
There's a picture. People are flying above a boat.

318
00:10:13,477 --> 00:10:14,844
I don't understand why people do that.

319
00:10:16,744 --> 00:10:20,410
(He has acrophobia)

320
00:10:20,410 --> 00:10:24,310
(Lively Park and Zin's challenges in Penang)

321
00:10:24,310 --> 00:10:28,577
(Lively Park and Zin's healing in Penang)

322
00:10:28,944 --> 00:10:30,010
We're finally heading off.

323
00:10:32,277 --> 00:10:32,944
(Incheon International Airport)

324
00:10:32,944 --> 00:10:34,177
(Kuala Lumpur)

325
00:10:34,177 --> 00:10:34,677
(Penang)

326
00:10:34,677 --> 00:10:35,810
(Takes 9 hours)

327
00:10:35,810 --> 00:10:37,377
It takes quite some time.

328
00:10:38,544 --> 00:10:40,644
We had a stopover in Hong Kong.

329
00:10:42,977 --> 00:10:44,944
It seems like it's worth visiting. The city looks exotic.

330
00:10:44,944 --> 00:10:46,344
Yes. What's amazing is that there's

331
00:10:46,344 --> 00:10:50,377
a Hindu temple, a Buddhist temple, a Catholic church

332
00:10:50,377 --> 00:10:51,877
and Protestant church all on one street.

333
00:10:51,877 --> 00:10:53,110
It's a very unique culture.

334
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:54,710
India, China,

335
00:10:54,710 --> 00:10:56,877
Malaysia, Europe. It's all mixed.

336
00:10:56,877 --> 00:10:57,610
That's very unique.

337
00:10:57,610 --> 00:10:59,677
That place looks like Europe.

338
00:10:59,677 --> 00:11:02,244
I kept forgetting I was in Malaysia.

339
00:11:03,044 --> 00:11:05,010
- That looks so good. / - It looks good.

340
00:11:05,010 --> 00:11:08,177
It's like the Jeolla-do of Malaysia.

341
00:11:08,177 --> 00:11:09,644
All the delicious food is there.

342
00:11:09,644 --> 00:11:11,477
- The Jeolla-do of Malaysia? / - Yes, Jeolla-do.

343
00:11:13,877 --> 00:11:15,577
We're finally here.

344
00:11:16,677 --> 00:11:17,810
- Honey. / - Yeah.

345
00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:19,510
We're finally here.

346
00:11:19,510 --> 00:11:21,177
- We're in a summer country. / - We're here.

347
00:11:21,177 --> 00:11:23,344
- Now... / - What should we take?

348
00:11:23,344 --> 00:11:24,644
Now whenever I see a suitcase,

349
00:11:24,644 --> 00:11:26,377
I feel like someone should get on.

350
00:11:26,377 --> 00:11:27,877
- I want to ride it. / - It's good, right?

351
00:11:27,877 --> 00:11:28,844
Yes.

352
00:11:28,844 --> 00:11:30,210
She should've rode the suitcase.

353
00:11:30,210 --> 00:11:31,977
What should we take?

354
00:11:31,977 --> 00:11:33,544
- Is there a bus? / - I checked it out.

355
00:11:34,410 --> 00:11:37,310
- There's taxi. / - From what I found out...

356
00:11:37,310 --> 00:11:39,710
Taxis here are different to what we know.

357
00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:43,510
There are taxis outside...

358
00:11:43,510 --> 00:11:45,544
- If you look here... / - Where are the taxis?

359
00:11:45,544 --> 00:11:47,144
- The taxis... / - Which one's a taxi?

360
00:11:47,144 --> 00:11:48,610
The important thing is that there are no taxis.

361
00:11:48,610 --> 00:11:50,577
- The taxis aren't marked. / - They're not.

362
00:11:50,577 --> 00:11:51,810
- How can you tell? / - You take a ticket.

363
00:11:51,810 --> 00:11:55,144
You use that ticket as a travel pass.

364
00:11:55,544 --> 00:11:58,010
So there'd be no illegal hustling

365
00:11:58,010 --> 00:11:59,444
by the drivers.

366
00:11:59,444 --> 00:12:01,710
At least not at the airport.

367
00:12:01,710 --> 00:12:03,077
He said 69, right?

368
00:12:03,077 --> 00:12:04,277
Is that $18 something?

369
00:12:04,277 --> 00:12:05,344
I think so.

370
00:12:05,344 --> 00:12:06,377
Thank you.

371
00:12:06,377 --> 00:12:08,677
I think this is the ticket. Let's go.

372
00:12:08,677 --> 00:12:10,177
We should present this ticket then?

373
00:12:10,177 --> 00:12:10,877
I think so.

374
00:12:11,710 --> 00:12:13,010
That's interesting.

375
00:12:13,010 --> 00:12:14,410
Ticket.

376
00:12:14,410 --> 00:12:15,544
Thank you.

377
00:12:17,377 --> 00:12:20,410
- Penang, Malaysia. / - Now I feel the heat...

378
00:12:20,410 --> 00:12:22,377
- It feels like we're really here. / - I know.

379
00:12:22,377 --> 00:12:23,510
Right?

380
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:24,944
How did you know about the taxi?

381
00:12:24,944 --> 00:12:26,410
It's amazing.

382
00:12:26,410 --> 00:12:28,277
- The ticket taxi, right? / - Yeah.

383
00:12:28,277 --> 00:12:30,310
You get ripped off so much on vacation.

384
00:12:30,310 --> 00:12:32,510
That's right. This is to prevent that

385
00:12:32,510 --> 00:12:35,410
here in Penang, George Town.

386
00:12:35,410 --> 00:12:36,477
The city hall's...

387
00:12:37,544 --> 00:12:39,277
I'm trying to talk here...

388
00:12:39,277 --> 00:12:41,944
Oops, I'm sorry. I wanted to shoot the airport.

389
00:12:44,944 --> 00:12:48,710
(They arrive at the hotel after an hour from the airport)

390
00:12:48,710 --> 00:12:49,677
Come here.

391
00:12:51,477 --> 00:12:53,610
What's this?

392
00:12:53,610 --> 00:12:56,010
Come over here. I prepared something for you.

393
00:12:57,310 --> 00:12:59,377
(Ta-da)

394
00:12:59,377 --> 00:13:01,910
We never had the chance to do things like this.

395
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:03,110
What's going on?

396
00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:04,377
- I... / - Yeah?

397
00:13:05,244 --> 00:13:07,644
- I've only seen these in dramas. / - They have swans!

398
00:13:07,644 --> 00:13:08,810
They have birds.

399
00:13:08,810 --> 00:13:09,844
They have swans.

400
00:13:09,844 --> 00:13:11,677
It's the first time I saw such a thing.

401
00:13:12,977 --> 00:13:14,210
Goodness.

402
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:16,877
- It's so pretty. / - The roses are in a heart shape.

403
00:13:16,877 --> 00:13:18,377
When did they... Right?

404
00:13:21,044 --> 00:13:23,410
1, 2, 3.

405
00:13:26,877 --> 00:13:28,977
Does your husband take a lot of photos for you?

406
00:13:28,977 --> 00:13:30,677
Not as much as her husband.

407
00:13:31,844 --> 00:13:32,777
Not as much...

408
00:13:33,544 --> 00:13:34,444
Not like Jiyoon.

409
00:13:34,444 --> 00:13:37,477
- You'll see. Pictures are all you're left with. / - Right.

410
00:13:37,477 --> 00:13:40,144
Our enjoyable Park and Zin Tour...

411
00:13:40,144 --> 00:13:41,610
Let's start it.

412
00:13:41,610 --> 00:13:43,610
Lively Park and Zin Tour!

413
00:13:47,744 --> 00:13:49,310
(Lively Park and Zin's challenges in Penang)

414
00:13:49,310 --> 00:13:51,744
(Center of Penang, George Town)

415
00:13:52,944 --> 00:13:54,744
Honey, look at me.

416
00:13:54,744 --> 00:13:57,277
(Checking herself out in Taehyun's sunglasses)

417
00:13:57,577 --> 00:13:59,377
It looks like they're on a honeymoon.

418
00:13:59,377 --> 00:14:01,444
- I really felt that way. / - That's enough.

419
00:14:01,444 --> 00:14:02,744
You look very pretty.

420
00:14:02,744 --> 00:14:03,744
Shall we go?

421
00:14:05,444 --> 00:14:07,844
Is this George Town?

422
00:14:07,844 --> 00:14:09,144
Yes, it's George Town.

423
00:14:09,744 --> 00:14:12,077
It's the old center of Penang.

424
00:14:12,577 --> 00:14:14,644
The whole town is designated

425
00:14:14,644 --> 00:14:16,077
as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

426
00:14:16,077 --> 00:14:17,410
I should definitely go there.

427
00:14:17,410 --> 00:14:19,344
The buildings are beautiful.

428
00:14:19,344 --> 00:14:21,144
- They look graceful. / - It feels like Europe.

429
00:14:21,144 --> 00:14:23,777
- You're right. It's a variety. / - It's fascinating.

430
00:14:23,777 --> 00:14:27,777
(It's a good photo spot because of the wall paintings)

431
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:31,277
- Yeah. / - They sell coconut shakes.

432
00:14:31,277 --> 00:14:33,410
- I'm thirsty and hot. / - Let's try coconut ice cream.

433
00:14:34,377 --> 00:14:35,110
Come here.

434
00:14:35,977 --> 00:14:38,477
- What's that? / - It's coconut ice cream.

435
00:14:38,477 --> 00:14:39,310
Hi.

436
00:14:40,744 --> 00:14:42,210
Having an ice cream?

437
00:14:42,210 --> 00:14:43,077
Coconut ice cream.

438
00:14:43,077 --> 00:14:44,344
Coconut shake.

439
00:14:44,344 --> 00:14:45,344
- One. / - One.

440
00:14:46,877 --> 00:14:47,710
Will it taste good?

441
00:14:50,077 --> 00:14:51,344
- Interesting. / - It's in here.

442
00:14:53,244 --> 00:14:55,077
I love my ice cream.

443
00:14:55,077 --> 00:14:56,444
I know.

444
00:14:56,444 --> 00:14:58,744
- You'll eat to your heart's content here. / - Yeah.

445
00:15:00,410 --> 00:15:01,610
Thank you.

446
00:15:02,977 --> 00:15:03,910
How much is it?

447
00:15:03,910 --> 00:15:05,677
It's $2.20 each.

448
00:15:05,677 --> 00:15:07,010
That's reasonable.

449
00:15:07,010 --> 00:15:08,544
- It looks good. / - This is coconut ice cream.

450
00:15:09,077 --> 00:15:10,710
Don't you think you gave me too little ice cream.

451
00:15:11,944 --> 00:15:12,844
Just eat it for now.

452
00:15:12,844 --> 00:15:14,377
It should be half ice cream and...

453
00:15:14,377 --> 00:15:15,377
Keep it down.

454
00:15:15,377 --> 00:15:16,644
Half peanut...

455
00:15:16,644 --> 00:15:18,610
Just try it already. How is it?

456
00:15:18,610 --> 00:15:19,477
- Is it good? / - Yeah.

457
00:15:20,644 --> 00:15:23,510
These things can't fail.

458
00:15:25,477 --> 00:15:26,744
I can taste the coconut.

459
00:15:26,744 --> 00:15:28,677
Why do you give me so little ice cream?

460
00:15:29,577 --> 00:15:31,110
What are you saving it for?

461
00:15:33,577 --> 00:15:35,144
Your teeth will ache if you eat it like that.

462
00:15:35,144 --> 00:15:36,177
You get a headache.

463
00:15:36,177 --> 00:15:37,977
If that was us, we would've ordered...

464
00:15:37,977 --> 00:15:39,244
- Two ice creams. / - You're right.

465
00:15:39,244 --> 00:15:41,444
- One each? / - While we've been eating this..

466
00:15:41,444 --> 00:15:42,644
I discovered something.

467
00:15:42,644 --> 00:15:44,210
- What? / - It will shock you.

468
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:45,844
Come here. I'll take a photo for you.

469
00:15:45,844 --> 00:15:46,977
Sit down.

470
00:15:46,977 --> 00:15:49,044
This village is full of murals.

471
00:15:49,044 --> 00:15:52,044
The coconut ice cream is part of our tour.

472
00:15:52,044 --> 00:15:53,544
- Okay. / - Sit there.

473
00:15:53,544 --> 00:15:54,277
Just like him.

474
00:15:54,877 --> 00:15:55,844
Oh, very good.

475
00:15:57,044 --> 00:15:57,877
That's it.

476
00:16:00,877 --> 00:16:03,010
- So pretty. / - That's so pretty.

477
00:16:03,010 --> 00:16:04,544
- That's a painting, right? / - Yes.

478
00:16:04,544 --> 00:16:05,544
It's a mural.

479
00:16:05,544 --> 00:16:07,044
That window painting looks nice.

480
00:16:07,044 --> 00:16:09,744
(Take a photo of me patting the kitty)

481
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:10,877
What are you doing?

482
00:16:10,877 --> 00:16:11,644
Did you take it?

483
00:16:11,644 --> 00:16:12,977
- What? / - You took only one photo?

484
00:16:15,477 --> 00:16:17,477
Trips are all about the photos.

485
00:16:17,477 --> 00:16:20,077
- That's no good. / - You need to take several to choose.

486
00:16:20,077 --> 00:16:22,877
Full, tight, top half. You need all those shots.

487
00:16:23,844 --> 00:16:25,410
Since the model is pretty.

488
00:16:25,410 --> 00:16:27,910
I never thought of all those angles.

489
00:16:27,910 --> 00:16:29,810
She's different since she's an actress.

490
00:16:29,810 --> 00:16:30,644
She's so pretty.

491
00:16:33,044 --> 00:16:34,910
- I... / - Can't we ride that?

492
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:36,110
What?

493
00:16:36,110 --> 00:16:37,510
- That. / - I've prepared everything.

494
00:16:38,177 --> 00:16:40,277
He looks confident.

495
00:16:40,277 --> 00:16:41,210
It was fun.

496
00:16:41,210 --> 00:16:42,077
What?

497
00:16:42,077 --> 00:16:43,777
It's a remodeled bicycle.

498
00:16:44,577 --> 00:16:45,344
Oh, that?

499
00:16:45,344 --> 00:16:46,444
It's a trishaw.

500
00:16:49,344 --> 00:16:51,344
We should go somewhere on this. Take a seat.

501
00:16:51,344 --> 00:16:52,110
Hello.

502
00:16:52,110 --> 00:16:54,010
- Hi. / - Hello.

503
00:16:54,010 --> 00:16:56,177
- Can you sit here? / - Cornwallis.

504
00:16:56,177 --> 00:16:56,844
Cornwallis.

505
00:16:58,510 --> 00:16:59,944
- A fort? / - Yes.

506
00:17:00,810 --> 00:17:01,544
It's a fort.

507
00:17:01,544 --> 00:17:03,277
Fort, fort.

508
00:17:04,377 --> 00:17:05,277
I really want to go there.

509
00:17:05,277 --> 00:17:06,410
I like these things.

510
00:17:06,410 --> 00:17:08,110
The fort?

511
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:09,944
I'll definitely go there.

512
00:17:09,944 --> 00:17:10,677
Where?

513
00:17:11,677 --> 00:17:13,010
Fort Cornwallis.

514
00:17:13,944 --> 00:17:14,844
Okay.

515
00:17:16,577 --> 00:17:18,310
You know why I want to go there?

516
00:17:18,310 --> 00:17:19,244
Why?

517
00:17:19,244 --> 00:17:20,844
You'll see once we get there.

518
00:17:22,210 --> 00:17:23,710
So just follow me.

519
00:17:24,544 --> 00:17:26,510
Don't look back though.

520
00:17:26,510 --> 00:17:28,444
The old man is driving

521
00:17:28,444 --> 00:17:29,810
so I feel guilty.

522
00:17:29,810 --> 00:17:30,744
I know.

523
00:17:32,277 --> 00:17:34,244
- This is good. / - Right.

524
00:17:34,244 --> 00:17:35,344
It feels cool.

525
00:17:35,344 --> 00:17:36,577
- It's quite cool. / - Yeah.

526
00:17:36,577 --> 00:17:38,644
- But if you're big... / - It's fun.

527
00:17:38,644 --> 00:17:41,210
You won't be able to share a seat.

528
00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:43,444
This place looks nice.

529
00:17:43,444 --> 00:17:44,944
Right?

530
00:17:44,944 --> 00:17:45,877
This place looks like Europe.

531
00:17:45,877 --> 00:17:47,544
The city is very attractive.

532
00:17:50,977 --> 00:17:52,910
Over here.

533
00:17:52,910 --> 00:17:54,744
I can see the white...

534
00:17:57,344 --> 00:17:58,710
That's...

535
00:17:58,710 --> 00:18:00,177
George Town city hall?

536
00:18:00,177 --> 00:18:02,510
That white building might be it.

537
00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:05,410
You're right. I do see a white building.

538
00:18:05,410 --> 00:18:07,844
That must be it. Can you see it?

539
00:18:09,777 --> 00:18:11,877
- That's the city hall. / - That building...

540
00:18:11,877 --> 00:18:13,544
- Is the most famous landmark. / - That building...

541
00:18:13,544 --> 00:18:14,410
It's so pretty.

542
00:18:14,410 --> 00:18:17,044
- It's the George Town city hall. / - Great for photos.

543
00:18:17,044 --> 00:18:18,010
It's quite small.

544
00:18:19,410 --> 00:18:20,777
Countries that had been colonized

545
00:18:20,777 --> 00:18:22,510
have a sad history...

546
00:18:22,510 --> 00:18:24,410
- Relics. / - But the buildings are beautiful.

547
00:18:26,110 --> 00:18:27,877
That's Fort Cornwallis.

548
00:18:28,810 --> 00:18:29,977
Stop.

549
00:18:30,777 --> 00:18:31,944
- I'll help you out. / - Okay.

550
00:18:34,877 --> 00:18:35,510
Come here.

551
00:18:36,744 --> 00:18:38,110
- Thank you. / - Thank you.

552
00:18:38,844 --> 00:18:39,910
Thank you.

553
00:18:42,277 --> 00:18:43,710
- There's an entrance fee. / - Yes.

554
00:18:43,710 --> 00:18:45,144
This place

555
00:18:45,144 --> 00:18:46,744
was built by the British.

556
00:18:47,644 --> 00:18:50,244
When the British got here,

557
00:18:50,244 --> 00:18:51,444
they built a fort.

558
00:18:51,444 --> 00:18:52,810
Taehyun studied a lot.

559
00:18:52,810 --> 00:18:54,777
- Yes, I was really surprised. / - Like a guide.

560
00:18:54,777 --> 00:18:56,344
- It's true. / - He played the guide.

561
00:18:56,344 --> 00:18:57,310
You studied a lot.

562
00:18:57,310 --> 00:19:00,044
- You don't need a guide. / - Captain Light built it.

563
00:19:00,044 --> 00:19:00,810
Here.

564
00:19:00,810 --> 00:19:02,577
That's why the fort is star-shaped.

565
00:19:02,577 --> 00:19:04,677
He wanted to explain that to you, Sieun.

566
00:19:04,677 --> 00:19:06,810
I mean, he likes to show off by nature.

567
00:19:06,810 --> 00:19:07,977
There's a real reason that

568
00:19:07,977 --> 00:19:10,210
I wanted to bring you here.

569
00:19:10,210 --> 00:19:11,644
What is it?

570
00:19:11,644 --> 00:19:13,677
There's a legend in that cannon.

571
00:19:13,677 --> 00:19:15,377
- That cannon over there? / - Yes.

572
00:19:17,610 --> 00:19:20,610
If we pray while putting...

573
00:19:20,610 --> 00:19:23,510
A flower inside this cannon...

574
00:19:23,510 --> 00:19:24,444
No way.

575
00:19:24,444 --> 00:19:25,710
Did he bring a flower?

576
00:19:26,844 --> 00:19:30,077
- If we pray while putting / - Okay.

577
00:19:30,077 --> 00:19:31,277
A flower inside this cannon,

578
00:19:31,277 --> 00:19:32,510
we'll be blessed with a child.

579
00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:34,644
This is why we came here?

580
00:19:34,644 --> 00:19:36,777
- I wondered why you kept saying... / - It will...

581
00:19:36,777 --> 00:19:39,110
- We had to go to the fort. / - Help you conceive.

582
00:19:39,110 --> 00:19:40,444
I bet many people come with flowers.

583
00:19:40,444 --> 00:19:41,410
That's right.

584
00:19:41,410 --> 00:19:44,410
- Those who want kids... / - Desperately.

585
00:19:44,410 --> 00:19:45,477
They'll come here.

586
00:19:47,044 --> 00:19:48,410
It's just like our dol hareubang.

587
00:19:48,410 --> 00:19:49,877
- Yes, like touching its nose. / - Yes.

588
00:19:50,677 --> 00:19:51,977
There are a lot of flowers inside.

589
00:19:51,977 --> 00:19:53,010
Really?

590
00:19:53,777 --> 00:19:54,710
I'm putting it in.

591
00:19:54,710 --> 00:19:55,510
Okay.

592
00:19:56,210 --> 00:19:57,277
I'll have a daughter.

593
00:20:00,710 --> 00:20:04,244
We always thought that we should

594
00:20:04,244 --> 00:20:05,444
have a child.

595
00:20:05,444 --> 00:20:06,910
But Taehyun said that

596
00:20:06,910 --> 00:20:09,277
he really liked our lives at the moment.

597
00:20:09,277 --> 00:20:10,810
He kept pushing it back.

598
00:20:10,810 --> 00:20:12,877
- He wanted to have it later. / - Really?

599
00:20:12,877 --> 00:20:16,210
- Goodness. /  - So I asked if he ever will.

600
00:20:16,210 --> 00:20:17,377
And he said we'd have to.

601
00:20:17,377 --> 00:20:20,044
So I suggested that we need to prepare.

602
00:20:20,044 --> 00:20:24,210
And he's been determined since last year.

603
00:20:24,210 --> 00:20:26,210
That we should really have a baby.

604
00:20:26,210 --> 00:20:29,477
Now babies look so beautiful.

605
00:20:30,444 --> 00:20:31,244
Baby girl?

606
00:20:31,244 --> 00:20:31,977
So cute.

607
00:20:31,977 --> 00:20:33,410
- I see. / - She was so cute.

608
00:20:33,410 --> 00:20:34,477
That's so cute.

609
00:20:37,810 --> 00:20:38,744
So cute.

610
00:20:40,344 --> 00:20:42,910
- So a baby will be added... / - We need a daughter.

611
00:20:42,910 --> 00:20:44,510
To your pictures.

612
00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:45,510
I'm a son.

613
00:20:47,410 --> 00:20:49,344
I can't have a son who takes after me.

614
00:20:50,944 --> 00:20:53,110
That's the only reason for my wish to have a daughter.

615
00:20:53,110 --> 00:20:54,277
Baby boys are beautiful

616
00:20:54,277 --> 00:20:55,610
but if he takes after me...

617
00:20:55,610 --> 00:20:57,344
I believe that

618
00:20:57,344 --> 00:21:00,044
I'm not a mature individual.

619
00:21:00,044 --> 00:21:01,144
I agree.

620
00:21:01,144 --> 00:21:02,844
- Men... / - Not mature...

621
00:21:02,844 --> 00:21:05,644
- A daughter like my wife. / - I find him charming.

622
00:21:05,644 --> 00:21:06,644
Right?

623
00:21:06,644 --> 00:21:08,144
- So have you made plans. / - I think so.

624
00:21:08,144 --> 00:21:10,077
We'll have one baby first.

625
00:21:10,077 --> 00:21:12,810
- First... / - But I feel like they'll need a sibling.

626
00:21:12,810 --> 00:21:14,344
- At least two. / - Isn't it great to have two?

627
00:21:14,344 --> 00:21:15,610
- It's great. / - It's great for them.

628
00:21:15,610 --> 00:21:16,944
Three is too much.

629
00:21:16,944 --> 00:21:19,277
- Three... / - Well, three for me...

630
00:21:19,277 --> 00:21:20,677
I'd like a third.

631
00:21:20,677 --> 00:21:23,377
I hear them speaking and...

632
00:21:23,377 --> 00:21:25,977
- Your husband doesn't want a third. / - He doesn't.

633
00:21:25,977 --> 00:21:27,444
- It must be too tough for him. / - What was that?

634
00:21:27,444 --> 00:21:28,944
He doesn't want a third.

635
00:21:28,944 --> 00:21:30,810
- What? / - I think only you want a third.

636
00:21:30,810 --> 00:21:32,277
It must be too hard.

637
00:21:32,277 --> 00:21:34,844
- Did you talk about a third baby? / - Yes, we are.

638
00:21:34,844 --> 00:21:36,277
Did he say he wants a third child?

639
00:21:36,277 --> 00:21:37,610
- No, not at all. / - He said yes.

640
00:21:37,610 --> 00:21:39,177
- Really? / - He said he does.

641
00:21:39,177 --> 00:21:40,877
She really wants another here.

642
00:21:41,910 --> 00:21:43,877
It must've been hard with the first two.

643
00:21:43,877 --> 00:21:45,277
I guess so.

644
00:21:48,044 --> 00:21:49,910
Honey, I'm getting hungry.

645
00:21:49,910 --> 00:21:51,377
Me too.

646
00:21:52,177 --> 00:21:54,210
Should we give the Malaysian cuisine a try?

647
00:21:54,877 --> 00:21:56,710
- Should we? / - I love eating local food.

648
00:21:56,710 --> 00:21:57,710
- Me too. / - Me too.

649
00:21:57,710 --> 00:21:59,377
I can tell this place is good.

650
00:21:59,377 --> 00:22:00,610
- There's also a mural here. / - It looks good.

651
00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:01,577
I'm hungrier after seeing the pictures.

652
00:22:01,577 --> 00:22:02,744
What should we get?

653
00:22:04,310 --> 00:22:06,210
Look at the prices.

654
00:22:06,210 --> 00:22:07,844
- Why is it so cheap? / - It's extremely cheap.

655
00:22:09,077 --> 00:22:10,777
- This is $1.80. / - It's really affordable there.

656
00:22:10,777 --> 00:22:11,844
- $1.80? / - That's a large.

657
00:22:11,844 --> 00:22:13,677
A bowl of noodles costs $1.80.

658
00:22:13,677 --> 00:22:14,977
If it's that cheap,

659
00:22:14,977 --> 00:22:16,310
we order around 10.

660
00:22:16,310 --> 00:22:18,244
- Really? My gosh. / - Foodies do that.

661
00:22:18,244 --> 00:22:19,044
Let's get that.

662
00:22:19,044 --> 00:22:20,977
- These fried noodles look good. / - What's this?

663
00:22:20,977 --> 00:22:23,110
I want Sambal fried rice.

664
00:22:23,110 --> 00:22:24,477
- This and, oh, chicken. / - This.

665
00:22:24,477 --> 00:22:26,077
- We have to have chicken. / - You can't go wrong...

666
00:22:26,077 --> 00:22:27,977
Wherever you order chicken.

667
00:22:27,977 --> 00:22:30,177
- Honey, can I have soup too? / - Huh?

668
00:22:30,177 --> 00:22:33,044
- 10 dishes is less than $20. / - Exactly.

669
00:22:33,044 --> 00:22:33,944
Sure, go ahead.

670
00:22:34,744 --> 00:22:35,444
It's cheap.

671
00:22:35,444 --> 00:22:36,777
But why do you ask?

672
00:22:36,777 --> 00:22:39,410
You'll order what you want anyway.

673
00:22:39,410 --> 00:22:41,210
Excuse me, hurry.

674
00:22:41,210 --> 00:22:42,777
You're just asking him to agree.

675
00:22:42,777 --> 00:22:43,677
- That's right. / - Yeah.

676
00:22:43,677 --> 00:22:45,044
Telling him what I'm ordering.

677
00:22:45,044 --> 00:22:46,744
This one.

678
00:22:46,744 --> 00:22:51,677
(Ordering without caring about price)

679
00:22:51,677 --> 00:22:52,944
- Thank you. / - Thank you.

680
00:22:56,244 --> 00:22:57,010
All that...

681
00:22:57,010 --> 00:22:58,777
- Was $9.30? / - It's less than $10?

682
00:22:58,777 --> 00:22:59,944
Isn't it amazing?

683
00:22:59,944 --> 00:23:01,510
- I love it. / - That's so good.

684
00:23:01,510 --> 00:23:03,144
And it was all so good.

685
00:23:03,144 --> 00:23:04,044
It looks good.

686
00:23:04,677 --> 00:23:06,010
This...

687
00:23:06,010 --> 00:23:07,244
- Oh, together. / - Mix it.

688
00:23:07,244 --> 00:23:08,110
Okay, okay.

689
00:23:08,110 --> 00:23:08,710
Thank you.

690
00:23:08,710 --> 00:23:10,044
This fragrance...

691
00:23:10,844 --> 00:23:12,377
That already looks good.

692
00:23:14,177 --> 00:23:15,010
This is...

693
00:23:15,010 --> 00:23:16,677
It's kind of like kimchi soup.

694
00:23:24,444 --> 00:23:25,177
What's wrong?

695
00:23:26,144 --> 00:23:27,277
Try it.

696
00:23:35,610 --> 00:23:36,710
I don't think it suits my taste.

697
00:23:37,944 --> 00:23:38,710
Honey.

698
00:23:39,577 --> 00:23:41,644
Look at his face.

699
00:23:41,644 --> 00:23:46,010
- He can't eat anything but Korean. / - It's a bit...

700
00:23:46,010 --> 00:23:47,144
I think it'll be like that.

701
00:23:50,310 --> 00:23:51,610
There's that face again.

702
00:23:52,810 --> 00:23:54,077
Thank you.

703
00:23:55,410 --> 00:23:56,944
He's a baby.

704
00:23:56,944 --> 00:23:58,710
Taehyun's a baby at times like this.

705
00:23:58,710 --> 00:23:59,777
It's not to his liking.

706
00:23:59,777 --> 00:24:01,477
And besides, that one

707
00:24:01,477 --> 00:24:03,710
came with fish meat on top.

708
00:24:03,710 --> 00:24:05,677
It tasted like salty dried filefish fillet.

709
00:24:05,677 --> 00:24:07,110
That was...

710
00:24:07,110 --> 00:24:08,610
That sounds delicious.

711
00:24:08,610 --> 00:24:09,344
Excuse me?

712
00:24:09,344 --> 00:24:10,844
Dried filefish fillet is good.

713
00:24:10,844 --> 00:24:11,544
But... Okay.

714
00:24:13,044 --> 00:24:14,144
Thank you.

715
00:24:14,144 --> 00:24:15,510
You need to stir together.

716
00:24:15,510 --> 00:24:16,477
Okay, okay.

717
00:24:17,710 --> 00:24:19,010
The food is served really quickly.

718
00:24:19,010 --> 00:24:19,910
I like that.

719
00:24:20,810 --> 00:24:21,677
Isn't it good?

720
00:24:22,410 --> 00:24:23,044
I guess he doesn't like it.

721
00:24:23,044 --> 00:24:25,210
- It must have a strong aroma. / - Isn't it okay?

722
00:24:26,244 --> 00:24:26,910
I'm curious.

723
00:24:26,910 --> 00:24:30,277
- This one tastes a bit sour. / - I think it'll taste good.

724
00:24:30,277 --> 00:24:32,110
It smells of coriander.

725
00:24:32,110 --> 00:24:33,110
Too much.

726
00:24:33,110 --> 00:24:34,210
This one's okay.

727
00:24:34,210 --> 00:24:37,377
It's like eating salty dried filefish fillet in kimchi soup.

728
00:24:37,377 --> 00:24:39,977
And it's been braised it in soy sauce.

729
00:24:39,977 --> 00:24:41,077
It's a mix of those two.

730
00:24:41,710 --> 00:24:43,877
This is like a bowl of noodles soup

731
00:24:43,877 --> 00:24:45,344
with canned fish, right?

732
00:24:45,344 --> 00:24:47,310
The noodles are softer than the udon noodles in Korea.

733
00:24:47,310 --> 00:24:49,444
- That looks delicious. / - The noodles look so good.

734
00:24:49,444 --> 00:24:50,744
That definitely must've been good.

735
00:24:50,744 --> 00:24:52,044
That's so...

736
00:24:52,044 --> 00:24:53,444
I have to try the rice.

737
00:24:53,444 --> 00:24:55,344
That dish was so good.

738
00:24:55,344 --> 00:24:56,444
I can tell your preference.

739
00:24:57,510 --> 00:24:58,377
Your style...

740
00:24:58,377 --> 00:24:59,910
- I like salty food. / - Is the sambal sauce good too?

741
00:24:59,910 --> 00:25:02,844
- The sauce here was good. / - This is...

742
00:25:02,844 --> 00:25:04,577
Sambal.

743
00:25:04,577 --> 00:25:06,377
Sambal, sambal.

744
00:25:06,377 --> 00:25:08,077
Try mixing this.

745
00:25:08,810 --> 00:25:10,177
I'll try the sambal.

746
00:25:13,577 --> 00:25:15,277
Luckily that one suits his taste.

747
00:25:15,277 --> 00:25:16,310
This is good.

748
00:25:21,544 --> 00:25:22,877
This is good. This is really good.

749
00:25:22,877 --> 00:25:23,777
This is to my liking.

750
00:25:24,977 --> 00:25:26,744
- It tastes like egg fried rice. / - Yes.

751
00:25:27,544 --> 00:25:29,010
It's like I'm mixing Tabasco sauce

752
00:25:29,010 --> 00:25:30,110
with the rice.

753
00:25:31,077 --> 00:25:32,844
The sauce is really spicy.

754
00:25:36,277 --> 00:25:37,110
How is it?

755
00:25:38,910 --> 00:25:39,810
This is to my liking.

756
00:25:39,810 --> 00:25:40,610
- It tastes okay? / - Yes.

757
00:25:40,610 --> 00:25:41,577
It was really good.

758
00:25:41,577 --> 00:25:43,277
I can eat these two dishes

759
00:25:43,277 --> 00:25:44,344
three meals a day.

760
00:25:48,010 --> 00:25:48,777
He's eating alone.

761
00:25:49,810 --> 00:25:50,810
You eat it.

762
00:25:53,177 --> 00:25:54,644
This is perfect for Koreans.

763
00:25:54,644 --> 00:25:56,144
I'll eat this until we leave.

764
00:25:56,810 --> 00:25:58,277
The chicken will be good no matter what...

765
00:25:58,277 --> 00:25:59,777
- So should we take it slow? / - We have to try it.

766
00:26:00,777 --> 00:26:02,044
See what Malaysian chicken is like.

767
00:26:02,044 --> 00:26:03,944
I feel like the chicken will taste weird.

768
00:26:03,944 --> 00:26:05,044
Oh, that... Yes.

769
00:26:05,744 --> 00:26:06,644
Right?

770
00:26:06,644 --> 00:26:07,944
It's full of spices, right?

771
00:26:07,944 --> 00:26:09,544
The aftertaste.

772
00:26:09,544 --> 00:26:11,010
A slight aftertaste.

773
00:26:12,644 --> 00:26:15,810
- Fried chicken always smells the same. / - No.

774
00:26:15,810 --> 00:26:18,444
- Fried chicken always smells the same. / - No.

775
00:26:19,177 --> 00:26:20,544
It has that smell I don't like.

776
00:26:26,210 --> 00:26:27,244
There's a hint of that.

777
00:26:27,244 --> 00:26:28,577
- Really? / - Yeah?

778
00:26:28,577 --> 00:26:30,944
Maybe it's because of the other dishes but I can't tell.

779
00:26:30,944 --> 00:26:33,310
You really have different tastes. Both couples.

780
00:26:33,310 --> 00:26:34,177
Yes.

781
00:26:34,177 --> 00:26:36,977
I was really surprised that he only likes Korean food.

782
00:26:36,977 --> 00:26:39,377
I thought he'd enjoy local foods.

783
00:26:40,210 --> 00:26:42,410
To be honest, I liked the fried chicken.

784
00:26:42,410 --> 00:26:44,310
I didn't understand what spices he could taste.

785
00:26:45,610 --> 00:26:47,444
I learned he was really sensitive.

786
00:26:49,377 --> 00:26:50,110
It's good.

787
00:26:50,510 --> 00:26:51,110
(Taehyun uploaded it on his SNS in the end)

788
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:54,077
(I recommend the noodles and fried rice)

789
00:26:54,077 --> 00:26:55,477
That's why when I travel...

790
00:26:55,477 --> 00:26:56,410
Do you pack kimchi?

791
00:26:56,410 --> 00:26:57,410
The first thing I do is look for Korean restaurants.

792
00:26:58,144 --> 00:26:59,510
I look up Korean restaurants.

793
00:26:59,510 --> 00:27:01,444
Next, I look up McDonald's.

794
00:27:01,677 --> 00:27:03,210
(Lively Park and Zin's challenge in Penang)

795
00:27:03,210 --> 00:27:05,477
(Extremely high observatory)

796
00:27:05,477 --> 00:27:07,744
- There's a special building here. / - What is it?

797
00:27:07,744 --> 00:27:09,377
It's one of the highest buildings here.

798
00:27:09,377 --> 00:27:10,544
- In Malaysia... / - 63 Square?

799
00:27:10,544 --> 00:27:12,577
Higher than 63 Square.

800
00:27:14,210 --> 00:27:15,310
There's such a building here?

801
00:27:15,310 --> 00:27:17,710
I heard there's this pretty observatory here.

802
00:27:19,610 --> 00:27:21,010
Wow, it's standing tall.

803
00:27:21,010 --> 00:27:22,477
You could see all of downtown Penang.

804
00:27:22,477 --> 00:27:23,277
That's right.

805
00:27:23,277 --> 00:27:25,910
- You'd have to make sure you go there. / - Right.

806
00:27:29,644 --> 00:27:31,210
With you, My Honey...

807
00:27:31,210 --> 00:27:32,977
- Goodness, My Honey? / - That's your pet name?

808
00:27:32,977 --> 00:27:33,910
Yes.

809
00:27:35,544 --> 00:27:36,910
- Honey. / - Yes?

810
00:27:36,910 --> 00:27:38,944
It's so hot and they're still holding hands.

811
00:27:38,944 --> 00:27:40,044
Geez...

812
00:27:40,044 --> 00:27:41,310
You call her My Honey?

813
00:27:41,310 --> 00:27:42,644
I... Yes.

814
00:27:42,644 --> 00:27:43,677
I'm sorry.

815
00:27:44,410 --> 00:27:46,110
- With you, My Honey... / - Yes?

816
00:27:46,110 --> 00:27:48,110
Why do you like tall buildings?

817
00:27:48,110 --> 00:27:49,410
I think...

818
00:27:49,410 --> 00:27:52,144
- Why do you like them? / - Maybe because I'm short.

819
00:27:53,710 --> 00:27:55,977
I think you like tall buildings too much.

820
00:27:55,977 --> 00:27:56,644
Why is that?

821
00:27:56,644 --> 00:27:58,277
It's not just me.

822
00:27:58,277 --> 00:27:59,577
Most people do.

823
00:27:59,577 --> 00:28:00,910
I'm terrified of heights.

824
00:28:00,910 --> 00:28:02,144
I hate high places.

825
00:28:02,144 --> 00:28:03,044
Why?

826
00:28:04,110 --> 00:28:04,777
I'm scared.

827
00:28:06,110 --> 00:28:07,610
I think it's this way.

828
00:28:07,610 --> 00:28:09,477
Yes. Thank you.

829
00:28:10,544 --> 00:28:11,844
Is it a theater?

830
00:28:15,477 --> 00:28:17,077
There are so many buildings.

831
00:28:18,344 --> 00:28:19,644
- Aren't there? / - Yes.

832
00:28:19,644 --> 00:28:21,577
It's like downtown.

833
00:28:21,577 --> 00:28:22,644
That scared me.

834
00:28:22,644 --> 00:28:23,444
Goodness.

835
00:28:23,444 --> 00:28:25,577
How annoying. Don't do that.

836
00:28:25,577 --> 00:28:26,144
Goodness.

837
00:28:26,144 --> 00:28:27,510
- How annoying. Don't do that. / - It opens up.

838
00:28:27,510 --> 00:28:29,310
It opened up so suddenly.

839
00:28:29,310 --> 00:28:31,244
Don't do that. Don't do that.

840
00:28:31,244 --> 00:28:33,110
You should've warned me.

841
00:28:33,110 --> 00:28:34,610
I was surprised too.

842
00:28:34,610 --> 00:28:36,677
- It's so... / - That's so, wow...

843
00:28:36,677 --> 00:28:38,477
This isn't too bad.

844
00:28:40,844 --> 00:28:42,877
This city is peculiar.

845
00:28:42,877 --> 00:28:44,377
- This city of Penang... / - It really is a peculiar city.

846
00:28:45,877 --> 00:28:46,944
Wow, that's so...

847
00:28:46,944 --> 00:28:48,077
That's seriously so...

848
00:28:48,077 --> 00:28:50,377
- It opens up to the real thing. / - Yes.

849
00:28:50,377 --> 00:28:51,444
Is that a painting or what?

850
00:28:51,444 --> 00:28:53,110
- It was amazing. I was so surprised. / - It's beautiful.

851
00:28:53,110 --> 00:28:55,110
Penang really reminds me

852
00:28:55,110 --> 00:28:56,177
of Ganghwado.

853
00:28:57,244 --> 00:28:58,610
This is fun.

854
00:28:58,610 --> 00:29:00,544
That was something new.

855
00:29:02,244 --> 00:29:03,077
Gravity?

856
00:29:03,077 --> 00:29:04,310
- What's this... / - Gravity.

857
00:29:04,944 --> 00:29:07,077
- What about gravity? Why? What? / - Gravity.

858
00:29:07,077 --> 00:29:08,544
I got that sick feeling in my stomach.

859
00:29:08,544 --> 00:29:09,710
- Wow, seriously... / - Honey.

860
00:29:09,710 --> 00:29:10,577
Something goes down here.

861
00:29:10,577 --> 00:29:12,244
- I was so... / - I...

862
00:29:12,244 --> 00:29:14,710
Actually brought you here without telling you.

863
00:29:14,710 --> 00:29:16,177
What is this place?

864
00:29:16,177 --> 00:29:17,177
What this is...

865
00:29:17,177 --> 00:29:18,377
You attach a rope.

866
00:29:18,377 --> 00:29:20,610
- No way. / - And walk out there.

867
00:29:20,610 --> 00:29:22,144
And walk out there.

868
00:29:22,144 --> 00:29:23,577
Oh, my God.

869
00:29:23,577 --> 00:29:25,077
And walk out there.

870
00:29:25,077 --> 00:29:26,277
Oh, my God.

871
00:29:27,777 --> 00:29:30,777
(Did you think it was a regular observatory?)

872
00:29:31,310 --> 00:29:32,610
I hate it.

873
00:29:33,244 --> 00:29:35,044
Jung Joonyoung and

874
00:29:35,044 --> 00:29:37,944
Choi Taejun did that in Macao.

875
00:29:37,944 --> 00:29:40,510
But this place is 6m higher.

876
00:29:40,510 --> 00:29:41,444
That's too high.

877
00:29:41,444 --> 00:29:43,577
We were so scared just watching them.

878
00:29:44,977 --> 00:29:46,344
They opened this in February this year?

879
00:29:46,344 --> 00:29:47,644
Yes, it's very new.

880
00:29:47,644 --> 00:29:49,977
Then you don't know how safe it is.

881
00:29:49,977 --> 00:29:51,777
That's so...

882
00:29:51,777 --> 00:29:52,977
It's making me angry.

883
00:29:53,910 --> 00:29:54,910
- That's so... / - Oh, no.

884
00:29:54,910 --> 00:29:56,544
He's hating it as he watches.

885
00:29:56,544 --> 00:29:57,510
I hate it.

886
00:29:57,510 --> 00:30:00,210
It seems that in general, romantic husbands

887
00:30:00,210 --> 00:30:01,844
have a great fear of heights.

888
00:30:02,644 --> 00:30:04,044
Now I know.

889
00:30:04,044 --> 00:30:05,677
- We tie a rope and go out? / - Yes.

890
00:30:06,410 --> 00:30:07,744
What do we do outside?

891
00:30:07,744 --> 00:30:09,577
We go out and walk around.

892
00:30:10,644 --> 00:30:12,010
You're all insane.

893
00:30:12,010 --> 00:30:14,277
But he's still holding your hand.

894
00:30:14,277 --> 00:30:15,810
- Even as he says that. / - Why would you do this?

895
00:30:16,544 --> 00:30:18,010
Don't do this.

896
00:30:18,010 --> 00:30:19,644
How am I going to do this?

897
00:30:20,444 --> 00:30:21,344
I can't do this.

898
00:30:24,510 --> 00:30:25,544
What, honey?

899
00:30:25,544 --> 00:30:27,077
- Honey, I'm sorry. / - First...

900
00:30:27,910 --> 00:30:29,377
I had no idea

901
00:30:29,377 --> 00:30:31,810
my wife would hide it from me.

902
00:30:33,177 --> 00:30:34,644
Because she knows me really well.

903
00:30:35,644 --> 00:30:36,577
But...

904
00:30:37,344 --> 00:30:38,244
Why did you...

905
00:30:39,277 --> 00:30:40,210
Do that to me?

906
00:30:41,510 --> 00:30:43,777
He looks like he's acting.

907
00:30:43,777 --> 00:30:44,777
"I can't go out there."

908
00:30:44,777 --> 00:30:46,344
It's like, "If you love me, go outside."

909
00:30:46,344 --> 00:30:47,410
Something like that.

910
00:30:47,410 --> 00:30:49,144
"If you love me, jump."

911
00:30:50,410 --> 00:30:53,310
Dongseok does everything despite his fear, right?

912
00:30:53,310 --> 00:30:54,410
He seems to do everything.

913
00:30:54,410 --> 00:30:55,477
- If I say I'll do it alone... / - How is he?

914
00:30:55,477 --> 00:30:57,477
He does it with me because he gets worried.

915
00:30:57,477 --> 00:30:58,444
- That's my husband. / - So cool.

916
00:30:58,444 --> 00:31:00,544
- He's a romanticist. / - That's so cool.

917
00:31:01,210 --> 00:31:03,644
Why are you asking me to do it?

918
00:31:04,210 --> 00:31:05,677
You know I'm afraid of heights.

919
00:31:06,244 --> 00:31:08,444
I thought maybe you might do it.

920
00:31:09,710 --> 00:31:11,744
I want to try this.

921
00:31:11,744 --> 00:31:13,377
I might...

922
00:31:13,377 --> 00:31:15,410
Just take on the challenge.

923
00:31:15,410 --> 00:31:16,577
Just here.

924
00:31:16,577 --> 00:31:18,544
We can do this only in Penang.

925
00:31:19,144 --> 00:31:20,210
Only in Penang.

926
00:31:20,710 --> 00:31:22,177
- Just once... / - I will...

927
00:31:23,010 --> 00:31:23,744
Do it fast.

928
00:31:23,744 --> 00:31:25,610
There's a door in the middle.

929
00:31:27,077 --> 00:31:28,577
- You noticed that? / - I did.

930
00:31:28,577 --> 00:31:30,144
I saw it.

931
00:31:30,144 --> 00:31:31,644
There's a door you can exit midway.

932
00:31:31,644 --> 00:31:33,810
- In case you get scared. / - In the middle?

933
00:31:33,810 --> 00:31:35,744
I noticed that.

934
00:31:35,744 --> 00:31:37,877
You knew.

935
00:31:40,077 --> 00:31:41,744
I'll come back in if I can't do it.

936
00:31:41,744 --> 00:31:43,277
- Yeah, but will you be okay? / - I'll attempt it.

937
00:31:43,277 --> 00:31:44,410
- Because... / -  You don't have to do it.

938
00:31:44,410 --> 00:31:45,410
I'll do it.

939
00:31:45,410 --> 00:31:46,177
Okay.

940
00:31:46,177 --> 00:31:47,910
I'll try it.

941
00:31:47,910 --> 00:31:49,577
And if I can't do it...

942
00:31:49,577 --> 00:31:51,710
Sieun knows how to persuade him.

943
00:31:51,710 --> 00:31:53,077
If I keep telling him to do it...

944
00:31:53,077 --> 00:31:54,210
"I won't do it."

945
00:31:54,210 --> 00:31:55,477
"Do it." "No."

946
00:31:55,477 --> 00:31:57,377
"I won't do it." He does that.

947
00:31:57,377 --> 00:31:58,544
But if I tell him, "You don't have to do it."

948
00:31:58,544 --> 00:32:00,410
"Don't worry about it." "Forget it."

949
00:32:00,410 --> 00:32:02,344
"It's better if you don't do it."

950
00:32:02,344 --> 00:32:03,677
If I say it like that...

951
00:32:03,677 --> 00:32:04,844
- That's funny. / - She has him in the palm of her hands.

952
00:32:04,844 --> 00:32:06,910
He's like, "Should I?"

953
00:32:06,910 --> 00:32:08,710
That's how people think.

954
00:32:09,277 --> 00:32:10,610
That's my big picture.

955
00:32:14,810 --> 00:32:15,744
Done?

956
00:32:15,744 --> 00:32:16,977
Write your real name.

957
00:32:18,644 --> 00:32:19,677
Your real name.

958
00:32:19,677 --> 00:32:20,910
You're Park Eunyeong.

959
00:32:22,910 --> 00:32:24,710
I'll die as Park Sieun. Got a problem with that?

960
00:32:25,410 --> 00:32:26,177
Is that good?

961
00:32:26,710 --> 00:32:28,944
(Happy)

962
00:32:29,377 --> 00:32:30,477
I get it.

963
00:32:30,477 --> 00:32:31,477
He's no longer smiling.

964
00:32:31,477 --> 00:32:32,777
He's like a typical grade schooler.

965
00:32:35,610 --> 00:32:36,644
It's not bad.

966
00:32:36,644 --> 00:32:37,410
Relax. Calm your nerves.

967
00:32:37,410 --> 00:32:38,110
What are you doing?

968
00:32:38,110 --> 00:32:39,710
I'm loosening your arms.

969
00:32:40,644 --> 00:32:41,477
Relax.

970
00:32:43,177 --> 00:32:43,944
Here.

971
00:32:45,110 --> 00:32:46,210
Are you okay?

972
00:32:46,210 --> 00:32:47,877
I can do this.

973
00:32:48,410 --> 00:32:49,577
That's really tough, right?

974
00:32:50,077 --> 00:32:51,144
Okay, good.

975
00:32:51,144 --> 00:32:52,910
Honey, just look at me.

976
00:32:52,910 --> 00:32:53,744
Okay?

977
00:32:55,077 --> 00:32:56,344
I'm scared too.

978
00:32:58,544 --> 00:33:02,277
(They start now)

979
00:33:03,944 --> 00:33:05,077
The sound is...

980
00:33:05,077 --> 00:33:07,777
- It's the wind. / - That's scary.

981
00:33:08,544 --> 00:33:10,010
That's...

982
00:33:10,010 --> 00:33:13,044
- Honey, I'm seriously... / - The floor has holes.

983
00:33:13,044 --> 00:33:14,244
Yes, it does.

984
00:33:14,244 --> 00:33:15,777
Okay.

985
00:33:15,777 --> 00:33:17,010
Honey...

986
00:33:17,010 --> 00:33:18,777
- You're okay. / - Honey, I'm seriously so...

987
00:33:18,777 --> 00:33:20,410
My wife stepped out so I had to.

988
00:33:20,410 --> 00:33:21,744
His face looks so grim.

989
00:33:22,477 --> 00:33:23,744
That's too scary.

990
00:33:24,710 --> 00:33:26,477
This is really hard.

991
00:33:26,477 --> 00:33:27,577
What do I do?

992
00:33:27,577 --> 00:33:29,410
Honey, what do I do?

993
00:33:29,410 --> 00:33:30,377
- I'll hold this. / - Oh...

994
00:33:31,777 --> 00:33:32,910
This is too hard.

995
00:33:32,910 --> 00:33:33,810
This is too hard.

996
00:33:34,310 --> 00:33:36,610
I can't look out.

997
00:33:36,610 --> 00:33:37,577
Honey...

998
00:33:38,644 --> 00:33:40,010
I'll take you to court right now!

999
00:33:40,544 --> 00:33:41,510
Don't touch me.

1000
00:33:41,510 --> 00:33:43,210
Don't grab me!

1001
00:33:43,210 --> 00:33:44,110
Okay, okay.

1002
00:33:44,110 --> 00:33:45,510
- Don't grab me! / - Take you to court!

1003
00:33:46,210 --> 00:33:47,944
He's so charismatic in dramas...

1004
00:33:48,944 --> 00:33:50,344
In dramas...

1005
00:33:50,344 --> 00:33:52,710
Honey, this is honestly too hard.

1006
00:33:53,244 --> 00:33:54,677
(Smile)

1007
00:33:54,677 --> 00:33:55,910
This is honestly too hard.

1008
00:33:56,244 --> 00:33:58,010
(Smiling)

1009
00:33:58,010 --> 00:33:59,944
Move along. It's too hard.

1010
00:33:59,944 --> 00:34:01,510
(Trying to look fine for the picture)

1011
00:34:01,510 --> 00:34:02,610
That photo.

1012
00:34:03,710 --> 00:34:05,277
- He smiled for the camera. / - Yes.

1013
00:34:06,444 --> 00:34:07,744
He sure is an actor.

1014
00:34:09,544 --> 00:34:10,510
Honey.

1015
00:34:13,277 --> 00:34:14,344
That was really scary.

1016
00:34:14,344 --> 00:34:15,677
You're doing great. Come here.

1017
00:34:17,610 --> 00:34:19,044
I'm being courageous.

1018
00:34:19,044 --> 00:34:20,744
Yes. You're doing so well.

1019
00:34:20,744 --> 00:34:21,610
I am.

1020
00:34:21,610 --> 00:34:23,444
Now, there will be a great bridge.

1021
00:34:23,444 --> 00:34:24,910
Welcome to a great bridge.

1022
00:34:24,910 --> 00:34:26,010
What's going on?

1023
00:34:26,010 --> 00:34:27,977
What is this?

1024
00:34:29,144 --> 00:34:29,877
What's going on?

1025
00:34:29,877 --> 00:34:31,477
- It's like a stepping stone bridge. / - It's a track.

1026
00:34:31,477 --> 00:34:33,110
Yes, they have a track.

1027
00:34:33,110 --> 00:34:34,944
They have missions along the way.

1028
00:34:34,944 --> 00:34:36,110
It was fun.

1029
00:34:37,444 --> 00:34:38,910
It's so scary with those gaps.

1030
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:40,610
- I can't do this. / - At first...

1031
00:34:40,610 --> 00:34:41,877
- It was easy. / - I don't want to do this.

1032
00:34:43,044 --> 00:34:44,210
Everybody, follow me.

1033
00:34:44,210 --> 00:34:45,277
I don't think I can.

1034
00:34:46,177 --> 00:34:47,410
I came this far.

1035
00:34:47,410 --> 00:34:48,577
Wait.

1036
00:34:49,344 --> 00:34:50,477
Excuse me.

1037
00:34:50,477 --> 00:34:52,210
- He'll go out? / - I'll go out.

1038
00:34:52,210 --> 00:34:53,510
Is he quitting?

1039
00:34:53,510 --> 00:34:54,144
I'm so...

1040
00:34:54,910 --> 00:34:56,744
You're sweating so much.

1041
00:34:56,744 --> 00:34:57,577
I'm proud of you.

1042
00:34:58,177 --> 00:34:59,110
I'm proud.

1043
00:34:59,110 --> 00:35:00,110
Did you quit?

1044
00:35:00,110 --> 00:35:00,977
I did.

1045
00:35:00,977 --> 00:35:01,844
Really?

1046
00:35:01,844 --> 00:35:04,344
- I had to. / - It's like a mom consoling her son.

1047
00:35:04,344 --> 00:35:05,610
She gave me permission.

1048
00:35:05,610 --> 00:35:06,577
You quit?

1049
00:35:06,577 --> 00:35:07,510
I'll call it quits here.

1050
00:35:08,744 --> 00:35:09,644
I'm so...

1051
00:35:09,644 --> 00:35:12,544
I don't recommend it to people who has acrophobia.

1052
00:35:12,544 --> 00:35:14,044
That'll be too difficult for them.

1053
00:35:15,144 --> 00:35:16,577
Honey, I'll go farther.

1054
00:35:16,577 --> 00:35:18,144
- More? / - Yes, I'll be back.

1055
00:35:20,377 --> 00:35:21,044
See you.

1056
00:35:21,044 --> 00:35:22,110
- Good job. / - Bye.

1057
00:35:25,344 --> 00:35:26,710
Good job.

1058
00:35:26,710 --> 00:35:27,877
Thank you.

1059
00:35:28,377 --> 00:35:29,344
After I sent him off,

1060
00:35:29,344 --> 00:35:31,844
I felt like a weight had been lifted.

1061
00:35:31,844 --> 00:35:33,510
- A bit... / - I was so...

1062
00:35:33,510 --> 00:35:36,444
Because I had to worry about him...

1063
00:35:36,444 --> 00:35:38,544
I was worried too.

1064
00:35:38,544 --> 00:35:40,044
There was an exit midway

1065
00:35:40,044 --> 00:35:41,310
so I told him to go inside.

1066
00:35:41,310 --> 00:35:42,744
That it's okay.

1067
00:35:43,377 --> 00:35:46,244
From then on, I could really

1068
00:35:46,244 --> 00:35:48,077
enjoy the tower.

1069
00:35:51,044 --> 00:35:53,910
I found out for the first time my wife likes this stuff.

1070
00:35:53,910 --> 00:35:55,877
- You're so cool. / - That's too narrow.

1071
00:35:55,877 --> 00:35:58,344
- I stood there...  / - The path before was wider.

1072
00:35:59,744 --> 00:36:01,877
Why is she doing that?

1073
00:36:01,877 --> 00:36:04,044
I really don't understand.

1074
00:36:04,044 --> 00:36:05,710
Why is she standing outside the building?

1075
00:36:07,410 --> 00:36:08,444
Seriously...

1076
00:36:09,777 --> 00:36:11,210
There's another scary challenge.

1077
00:36:11,810 --> 00:36:13,144
This is scary.

1078
00:36:13,144 --> 00:36:15,244
It's scary when you can see below...

1079
00:36:15,877 --> 00:36:17,044
Through the walkway.

1080
00:36:20,144 --> 00:36:20,944
Hey.

1081
00:36:20,944 --> 00:36:23,210
How am I going to take photos for her here?

1082
00:36:23,210 --> 00:36:24,344
This is insane.

1083
00:36:25,544 --> 00:36:26,610
I can't even step on that.

1084
00:36:33,677 --> 00:36:35,544
- She's sitting down there? / - It's like that.

1085
00:36:36,177 --> 00:36:36,877
Did you miss this?

1086
00:36:36,877 --> 00:36:38,410
I couldn't see... Oh, my...

1087
00:36:40,477 --> 00:36:43,010
- Put your legs like that? / - Like this...

1088
00:36:43,010 --> 00:36:44,877
That's a challenge as well.

1089
00:36:44,877 --> 00:36:46,077
Sitting down then standing up.

1090
00:36:47,244 --> 00:36:48,477
- You have to take a seat? / - Yes.

1091
00:36:48,477 --> 00:36:49,477
You're amazing.

1092
00:36:51,344 --> 00:36:53,177
What is she doing?

1093
00:36:53,177 --> 00:36:54,444
Why would you sit there?

1094
00:36:54,444 --> 00:36:55,610
I don't believe this...

1095
00:37:01,610 --> 00:37:04,977
- Stop filming now. / - In case he loses a wife.

1096
00:37:04,977 --> 00:37:06,310
I'm really scared.

1097
00:37:07,110 --> 00:37:09,077
This is nice. I find this fun.

1098
00:37:09,677 --> 00:37:11,277
- Oh, dear. / - Park Sieun...

1099
00:37:11,277 --> 00:37:12,744
You'd never expect this of her.

1100
00:37:12,744 --> 00:37:14,177
- She's different to how she looks. / - It's like my escape.

1101
00:37:17,077 --> 00:37:18,977
No way!

1102
00:37:18,977 --> 00:37:20,377
You do the "Titanic" here.

1103
00:37:20,910 --> 00:37:23,410
That was really scary.

1104
00:37:23,410 --> 00:37:24,777
Don't!

1105
00:37:25,144 --> 00:37:26,444
Not this!

1106
00:37:30,844 --> 00:37:32,377
Don't!

1107
00:37:35,144 --> 00:37:35,877
Unbelievable.

1108
00:37:37,144 --> 00:37:38,644
That's unbelievable.

1109
00:37:39,477 --> 00:37:40,877
But this...

1110
00:37:40,877 --> 00:37:42,544
- The course is really fun. / - It is, right?

1111
00:37:42,544 --> 00:37:44,210
The first thing I thought was,

1112
00:37:44,210 --> 00:37:45,610
"Wait, that's dangerous."

1113
00:37:46,410 --> 00:37:48,444
I kept thinking that.

1114
00:37:48,444 --> 00:37:49,810
I didn't want her to do it.

1115
00:37:49,810 --> 00:37:50,910
Then...

1116
00:37:52,510 --> 00:37:54,677
I saw her enjoy it.

1117
00:37:55,444 --> 00:37:57,677
And I realized that...

1118
00:37:58,344 --> 00:38:00,810
I've been doing things that only I like.

1119
00:38:01,444 --> 00:38:03,310
My wife has been doing things that only I like.

1120
00:38:04,210 --> 00:38:05,144
She did that for me.

1121
00:38:06,910 --> 00:38:09,310
- He realized something through this. / - I felt bad.

1122
00:38:09,310 --> 00:38:12,477
- I recommend this to lovers. / - Battle Trip is so...

1123
00:38:12,477 --> 00:38:14,744
When you to scary high places...

1124
00:38:14,744 --> 00:38:15,877
- You come together. / - Oh, really?

1125
00:38:15,877 --> 00:38:17,744
- You become closer. / - You hold each other too.

1126
00:38:17,744 --> 00:38:19,244
- Rely on each other. / - That's right.

1127
00:38:19,244 --> 00:38:20,444
If your man holds your hand,

1128
00:38:20,444 --> 00:38:21,677
he seems so dependable.

1129
00:38:21,677 --> 00:38:22,644
You're right.

1130
00:38:22,644 --> 00:38:25,077
You feel like you can trust him with your life.

1131
00:38:25,077 --> 00:38:25,877
Did you enjoy it?

1132
00:38:26,444 --> 00:38:27,377
- It was fun. / - Let me see.

1133
00:38:30,177 --> 00:38:31,177
You look pretty.

1134
00:38:32,477 --> 00:38:33,510
You look pretty.

1135
00:38:33,510 --> 00:38:35,244
It was so fun. Are you okay?

1136
00:38:35,244 --> 00:38:36,110
Honey, are you okay?

1137
00:38:36,110 --> 00:38:37,010
Look at me.

1138
00:38:37,010 --> 00:38:38,910
- Aren't you dizzy? Are you okay? / - I feel dizzy.

1139
00:38:39,544 --> 00:38:40,410
You do?

1140
00:38:40,410 --> 00:38:41,444
You did a great job too.

1141
00:38:42,510 --> 00:38:44,877
I thought that after I finished the course,

1142
00:38:44,877 --> 00:38:48,277
I thought he'd really console me.

1143
00:38:48,277 --> 00:38:49,977
- But as soon as I stepped in... / - That's like us.

1144
00:38:49,977 --> 00:38:53,444
I started to console him instead.

1145
00:38:53,444 --> 00:38:55,377
- It's so funny how she comforts him. / - It's okay.

1146
00:38:56,477 --> 00:38:58,377
I found myself comforting him.

1147
00:38:58,377 --> 00:39:01,710
But so what?

1148
00:39:01,710 --> 00:39:03,677
I think couples just need to meet halfway.

1149
00:39:03,677 --> 00:39:06,510
There's no law saying the man has to comfort the wife.

1150
00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:09,844
We can just adjust to the situation.

1151
00:39:09,844 --> 00:39:11,310
I believe women need to provide

1152
00:39:11,310 --> 00:39:12,377
their shoulders to lean on at times.

1153
00:39:12,377 --> 00:39:13,944
I believe women need to provide

1154
00:39:13,944 --> 00:39:15,077
their shoulders to lean on at times.

1155
00:39:15,277 --> 00:39:17,110
You're so cool.

1156
00:39:17,110 --> 00:39:20,210
A woman needs to lend her shoulder too.

1157
00:39:21,677 --> 00:39:23,844
- That's my style. / - I'd better learn.

1158
00:39:23,910 --> 00:39:25,444
(Lively Park and Zin's challenges in Penang)

1159
00:39:25,444 --> 00:39:27,544
(Penang style steamboat)

1160
00:39:28,744 --> 00:39:32,544
When I was there, I really enjoyed steamboat.

1161
00:39:32,544 --> 00:39:34,477
What's a steamboat?

1162
00:39:34,477 --> 00:39:36,477
It's like shabu shabu.

1163
00:39:36,477 --> 00:39:37,310
That looks good.

1164
00:39:37,310 --> 00:39:40,277
You add vegetables and seafood

1165
00:39:40,277 --> 00:39:43,044
and boil it in broth. It's really tasty.

1166
00:39:43,810 --> 00:39:44,510
- I'd better try that. / - It's good.

1167
00:39:44,510 --> 00:39:46,710
- Steamboat? / - Those things aren't fattening.

1168
00:39:46,710 --> 00:39:48,077
- True. / - It's diet food.

1169
00:39:48,077 --> 00:39:49,944
You can eat as much as you like.

1170
00:39:55,044 --> 00:39:57,177
I wonder why it's called steamboat.

1171
00:39:57,177 --> 00:39:58,877
I think there's a steamer in the middle.

1172
00:40:05,577 --> 00:40:06,477
Package.

1173
00:40:06,477 --> 00:40:09,677
(The owner recommends the popular menu)

1174
00:40:09,677 --> 00:40:10,910
Since we're here...

1175
00:40:10,910 --> 00:40:13,510
Out of A, B, and C, A is the most expensive.

1176
00:40:13,510 --> 00:40:14,510
It has the most.

1177
00:40:14,510 --> 00:40:16,410
- Let's eat the one with the most menu. / - Of course.

1178
00:40:16,410 --> 00:40:18,410
- They put dried noodles in it. / - Set A.

1179
00:40:18,410 --> 00:40:20,944
You add dry noodles to it.

1180
00:40:23,210 --> 00:40:25,177
You look really tired.

1181
00:40:25,177 --> 00:40:26,044
Me?

1182
00:40:26,044 --> 00:40:27,810
Before our food is served,

1183
00:40:27,810 --> 00:40:30,610
let me give you a massage.

1184
00:40:32,177 --> 00:40:34,044
You had a really hard time.

1185
00:40:34,977 --> 00:40:38,244
That's similar to my husband after the swing.

1186
00:40:38,244 --> 00:40:40,177
- He's a bit out of it, right? / - Yes, he is.

1187
00:40:41,677 --> 00:40:43,877
I'll give you a massage.

1188
00:40:43,877 --> 00:40:45,344
She's still consoling him.

1189
00:40:45,344 --> 00:40:46,977
- She's even giving him a massage. / - That hurts.

1190
00:40:46,977 --> 00:40:49,444
The husband is too high maintenance.

1191
00:40:50,777 --> 00:40:52,444
- That's going to air on TV, isn't it? / - Younger guys...

1192
00:40:52,444 --> 00:40:53,910
Tends to be cute like that.

1193
00:40:53,910 --> 00:40:55,277
Turn around.

1194
00:40:56,544 --> 00:40:57,844
That really hurts, honey.

1195
00:41:00,177 --> 00:41:01,177
Steamboat.

1196
00:41:02,177 --> 00:41:03,410
It's huge.

1197
00:41:03,410 --> 00:41:05,777
- Oh, I like this. / - It's really like a boat.

1198
00:41:06,277 --> 00:41:09,177
(A giant steamboat enters)

1199
00:41:09,710 --> 00:41:10,910
Let's dig in.

1200
00:41:11,277 --> 00:41:13,344
- It's really boiling. / - You're right.

1201
00:41:13,344 --> 00:41:14,844
Is there something underneath?

1202
00:41:14,844 --> 00:41:16,410
There's nothing there

1203
00:41:16,410 --> 00:41:18,244
but there is in the middle.

1204
00:41:18,244 --> 00:41:20,177
Do you know why it's boiling when

1205
00:41:20,177 --> 00:41:21,610
there's no heat source?

1206
00:41:21,610 --> 00:41:23,177
- Why is that? / - I was curious about that.

1207
00:41:23,177 --> 00:41:26,244
Is there a stove under the pot?

1208
00:41:26,944 --> 00:41:29,244
There's charcoal in here.

1209
00:41:29,244 --> 00:41:31,077
- It's heated with the charcoal. / - In here?

1210
00:41:31,077 --> 00:41:32,410
It's like a brass chafing dish.

1211
00:41:32,410 --> 00:41:33,877
There's coal in the tube

1212
00:41:33,877 --> 00:41:35,710
so it keeps everything warm.

1213
00:41:35,710 --> 00:41:37,410
- So that cooks it. / - It keeps it warm.

1214
00:41:38,910 --> 00:41:39,677
That's fascinating.

1215
00:41:39,677 --> 00:41:41,977
- Oh, it's not a fire underneath? / - No.

1216
00:41:41,977 --> 00:41:42,744
That's right.

1217
00:41:42,744 --> 00:41:44,144
Let's try the broth first.

1218
00:41:44,677 --> 00:41:45,977
That was really good.

1219
00:41:46,644 --> 00:41:48,444
That broth must be so tasty.

1220
00:41:49,544 --> 00:41:50,977
What is the broth made of?

1221
00:41:50,977 --> 00:41:53,477
- It had a garlic flavor. / - It's just regular broth.

1222
00:41:54,510 --> 00:41:56,944
- It's tasty. / - Clear broth.

1223
00:41:56,944 --> 00:41:58,877
It has a strong garlic and pepper aroma.

1224
00:41:58,877 --> 00:41:59,877
Shabu shabu with that kind of broth.

1225
00:41:59,877 --> 00:42:01,344
Is it like chicken broth?

1226
00:42:01,344 --> 00:42:05,177
- It's similar to that plus garlic. / - It's seasoned.

1227
00:42:05,177 --> 00:42:07,844
At the end of the shabu shabu,

1228
00:42:07,844 --> 00:42:09,410
the broth is all seasoned.

1229
00:42:09,410 --> 00:42:11,944
- That's so good. / - It's like that from the start.

1230
00:42:11,944 --> 00:42:14,077
- So it must be a bit salty. / - Yes.

1231
00:42:14,077 --> 00:42:14,910
Sambal.

1232
00:42:20,910 --> 00:42:23,410
The fish cake was much more delicious than in Korea.

1233
00:42:23,410 --> 00:42:25,410
They have great fishcake there.

1234
00:42:25,410 --> 00:42:27,144
They make it out of fresh fish.

1235
00:42:27,744 --> 00:42:30,177
It's homemade fishcake.

1236
00:42:30,177 --> 00:42:31,577
- It's good, right? / - Homemade fishcake.

1237
00:42:31,577 --> 00:42:32,777
It was really good.

1238
00:42:32,777 --> 00:42:34,477
It's good.

1239
00:42:34,477 --> 00:42:36,344
- Is that to your liking? / - I think so.

1240
00:42:36,344 --> 00:42:37,244
That's a relief.

1241
00:42:37,244 --> 00:42:39,710
It's like a mother asking her son, "Do you like it?"

1242
00:42:39,710 --> 00:42:41,577
And the boy goes, "Yes, mommy."

1243
00:42:42,510 --> 00:42:44,444
Oh, this...

1244
00:42:44,444 --> 00:42:48,310
- As you know, I only like Korean food. / - Yeah.

1245
00:42:48,310 --> 00:42:49,877
Nevertheless, it's good.

1246
00:42:50,777 --> 00:42:52,377
Let's try the fish.

1247
00:42:53,544 --> 00:42:55,510
- It seems like meat. / - Yeah? I'll add it.

1248
00:42:55,510 --> 00:42:58,377
Dip it... Then take it out and eat.

1249
00:42:58,377 --> 00:42:59,577
I'm going to try it as is.

1250
00:42:59,577 --> 00:43:02,110
- Dip then take out... / - What type of fish is it?

1251
00:43:02,110 --> 00:43:03,977
- Grouper? / - Grouper.

1252
00:43:05,244 --> 00:43:07,177
It's a saw-edged perch.

1253
00:43:07,177 --> 00:43:09,177
- A white fish. / - Yes.

1254
00:43:09,177 --> 00:43:10,777
It's too expensive in Korea.

1255
00:43:10,777 --> 00:43:13,544
- But it's affordable there. / - It's like deep fried puffer fish.

1256
00:43:14,377 --> 00:43:16,344
- The inside meat is clean. / - Right.

1257
00:43:16,344 --> 00:43:17,644
- Deep fried puffer fish is tasty. / - The white meat.

1258
00:43:17,644 --> 00:43:19,544
It's like really tender chicken.

1259
00:43:20,744 --> 00:43:22,577
- Deep fried puffer fish. / - Like deep fried puffer fish.

1260
00:43:22,577 --> 00:43:24,777
You get that at a puffer fish restaurant.

1261
00:43:26,144 --> 00:43:27,477
- It's really good. / - It's good on its own.

1262
00:43:29,744 --> 00:43:36,877
(They gulp down everything)

1263
00:43:40,610 --> 00:43:42,644
- I'm eating too much. / - After you finish it all...

1264
00:43:42,644 --> 00:43:44,510
You add the spicy sauce to the broth and...

1265
00:43:45,677 --> 00:43:47,877
- Then you start over. / - Reset.

1266
00:43:47,877 --> 00:43:49,277
Very true.

1267
00:43:49,277 --> 00:43:51,910
(Park and Zin's first day comes to an end)

1268
00:43:52,810 --> 00:43:55,277
For mothers, even if they want to go to a good place...

1269
00:43:55,277 --> 00:43:57,744
- It depends on whether it's kid-friendly. / - Right.

1270
00:43:57,744 --> 00:43:59,010
But this place is fine.

1271
00:43:59,010 --> 00:44:01,544
You can let your kids grab one and eat.

1272
00:44:01,544 --> 00:44:02,110
That's right.

1273
00:44:02,110 --> 00:44:03,210
They can eat that.

1274
00:44:03,910 --> 00:44:05,910
(Lively Park and Zin in Penang, day 2)

1275
00:44:05,910 --> 00:44:07,444
The ocean color is so beautiful.

1276
00:44:07,777 --> 00:44:09,410
Honey, what are we doing today?

1277
00:44:09,410 --> 00:44:10,910
Today, we're going to a beach.

1278
00:44:10,910 --> 00:44:14,877
- Taehyun, did you plan both days? / - Yes.

1279
00:44:15,710 --> 00:44:16,644
We have to go.

1280
00:44:16,644 --> 00:44:18,244
- Honey. / - What now?

1281
00:44:18,244 --> 00:44:20,610
- I really... / - You're going to say something strange.

1282
00:44:21,144 --> 00:44:25,444
I haven't gone shopping properly yet.

1283
00:44:25,877 --> 00:44:27,477
- Shopping? / - Here we go.

1284
00:44:27,477 --> 00:44:30,510
- Just how much shopping is proper? / - I know.

1285
00:44:30,510 --> 00:44:32,944
- Really? / - There were some pretty things...

1286
00:44:32,944 --> 00:44:34,677
But you kept pushing me to move on.

1287
00:44:34,677 --> 00:44:37,577
Everything was so rushed yesterday.

1288
00:44:37,577 --> 00:44:38,744
I really couldn't look at anything.

1289
00:44:38,744 --> 00:44:40,344
You don't need much time, right?

1290
00:44:41,410 --> 00:44:44,310
If it takes long, I might have to leave.

1291
00:44:44,310 --> 00:44:46,244
I'd love to go to accessory shops.

1292
00:44:46,244 --> 00:44:48,644
- Don't go to accessory shops. / - Alright.

1293
00:44:48,644 --> 00:44:50,544
Seriously, it takes ages for her.

1294
00:44:50,544 --> 00:44:52,877
You will make the viewers think it actually takes ages.

1295
00:44:52,877 --> 00:44:54,044
It does take ages.

1296
00:44:56,877 --> 00:44:57,677
You need to choose.

1297
00:44:57,677 --> 00:44:59,144
Decide what you'll buy beforehand.

1298
00:44:59,144 --> 00:45:01,310
- How can you do that? / - What on earth?

1299
00:45:01,310 --> 00:45:02,610
You can't.

1300
00:45:02,610 --> 00:45:04,677
- Right. / - See? They're going crazy over there.

1301
00:45:04,677 --> 00:45:05,810
You should know what you want and

1302
00:45:05,810 --> 00:45:07,044
how much it costs.

1303
00:45:07,044 --> 00:45:08,877
- That way, it'll end in 5 minutes. / - Don't decide there.

1304
00:45:08,877 --> 00:45:10,477
There's too much when you go there.

1305
00:45:13,610 --> 00:45:15,344
Anyway, I beg you.

1306
00:45:16,144 --> 00:45:18,610
(Lively Park and Zin's healing in Penang)

1307
00:45:18,610 --> 00:45:22,077
(George Town shopping)

1308
00:45:22,310 --> 00:45:26,644
(George Town)

1309
00:45:27,510 --> 00:45:29,077
(George Town's street art)

1310
00:45:29,077 --> 00:45:31,544
It's like Garosu-gil in Korea.

1311
00:45:31,544 --> 00:45:33,544
- There are many people on dates. / - Right.

1312
00:45:33,544 --> 00:45:34,844
It's similar to Samcheong-dong.

1313
00:45:34,844 --> 00:45:38,210
- It feels like there are more people. / - I know.

1314
00:45:38,210 --> 00:45:40,677
When I heard you were shopping,

1315
00:45:40,677 --> 00:45:42,044
I got exhausted.

1316
00:45:42,044 --> 00:45:43,977
But I said I won't enter any shops

1317
00:45:43,977 --> 00:45:45,444
I haven't looked at already.

1318
00:45:45,444 --> 00:45:47,077
Just the place we went yesterday.

1319
00:45:47,077 --> 00:45:48,910
Wait a minute. Where was that?

1320
00:45:48,910 --> 00:45:50,877
- The place we went yesterday. / - I'm scanning.

1321
00:45:50,877 --> 00:45:53,944
- I went but I couldn't buy anything. / - Accessory shop?

1322
00:45:56,310 --> 00:45:57,444
Pin cushion.

1323
00:45:59,144 --> 00:46:01,244
- The place you went yesterday. / - I have to find it.

1324
00:46:01,244 --> 00:46:02,844
- You've staked out a place? / - Yes.

1325
00:46:02,844 --> 00:46:05,510
That's why you wanted to come here.

1326
00:46:05,510 --> 00:46:07,244
I thought you wanted to start over.

1327
00:46:07,244 --> 00:46:09,377
- I did want to look in here yesterday. / - Where?

1328
00:46:09,377 --> 00:46:10,510
- Here. / - Oh, here?

1329
00:46:10,510 --> 00:46:13,077
Look around. Take a quick look around.

1330
00:46:13,777 --> 00:46:15,344
(I knew this would happen)

1331
00:46:15,344 --> 00:46:16,610
Okay.

1332
00:46:16,610 --> 00:46:18,977
Honey, I want to buy something for now.

1333
00:46:18,977 --> 00:46:20,477
- Okay. / - Choose one for me.

1334
00:46:20,477 --> 00:46:21,744
- Something that suits you now. / - Buy it on site...

1335
00:46:21,744 --> 00:46:24,344
- And wear it right away. / - That's what it's about.

1336
00:46:24,344 --> 00:46:26,144
- That's the beauty of travel. / - Right.

1337
00:46:26,144 --> 00:46:27,477
This one suits you.

1338
00:46:27,477 --> 00:46:28,710
- This one? / - Yeah.

1339
00:46:30,910 --> 00:46:31,710
Right?

1340
00:46:31,710 --> 00:46:33,910
They're nice but...

1341
00:46:35,844 --> 00:46:38,377
How about this? Is it too much of a flower pattern?

1342
00:46:38,377 --> 00:46:40,344
I personally like this one.

1343
00:46:40,344 --> 00:46:41,144
- This? / - No, no.

1344
00:46:41,144 --> 00:46:42,710
You chose this one earlier.

1345
00:46:42,710 --> 00:46:44,044
Then this one.

1346
00:46:44,044 --> 00:46:46,177
They look the same to him.

1347
00:46:46,177 --> 00:46:49,444
You can tell if you focus. He's just not looking.

1348
00:46:49,444 --> 00:46:51,910
Geez, what is that?

1349
00:46:52,510 --> 00:46:53,644
There's too much variety.

1350
00:46:53,644 --> 00:46:55,110
I can't choose at times like this.

1351
00:46:56,210 --> 00:46:58,377
- This is nice too. / - There isn't...

1352
00:46:58,377 --> 00:46:59,944
That much variety here.

1353
00:46:59,944 --> 00:47:02,977
There were so many in different colors.

1354
00:47:02,977 --> 00:47:04,744
You need to buy one in each color.

1355
00:47:04,744 --> 00:47:07,277
- When someone's waiting, you're rushed... / - Yeah.

1356
00:47:07,277 --> 00:47:08,777
You can't choose comfortably.

1357
00:47:10,244 --> 00:47:11,877
(He escapes the scene)

1358
00:47:11,877 --> 00:47:13,377
Honey, what do you think of this? Honey?

1359
00:47:13,377 --> 00:47:14,577
- Yes? / - What about this?

1360
00:47:15,910 --> 00:47:18,377
- The blue one looks better, right? / - The blue is better.

1361
00:47:19,310 --> 00:47:21,310
(End of discussion)

1362
00:47:22,077 --> 00:47:23,410
Honey, what do you think of this?

1363
00:47:25,077 --> 00:47:26,510
Do you have to use the camera?

1364
00:47:26,510 --> 00:47:27,777
I have to see it up close.

1365
00:47:27,777 --> 00:47:30,077
- Good! / - That one's nice.

1366
00:47:30,077 --> 00:47:31,410
It suits your clothes right now.

1367
00:47:34,044 --> 00:47:35,177
I prefer the other one.

1368
00:47:35,177 --> 00:47:38,210
- She's already chosen one. / - They're the same.

1369
00:47:38,210 --> 00:47:39,810
They're different.

1370
00:47:39,810 --> 00:47:41,344
- That one? / - Get the blue one.

1371
00:47:41,344 --> 00:47:42,877
- This one? / - The blue one looks good on you.

1372
00:47:42,877 --> 00:47:45,177
Okay. See how it looks on me.

1373
00:47:45,177 --> 00:47:47,710
- The blue one is really pretty. / - Right?

1374
00:47:47,710 --> 00:47:49,177
- The blue one looks good. / - Yes, the blue.

1375
00:47:49,177 --> 00:47:51,210
- How much was it? / - How does it look?

1376
00:47:52,277 --> 00:47:53,810
Does it suit me? It looks refreshing.

1377
00:47:53,810 --> 00:47:55,044
Yeah. Buy that one.

1378
00:47:55,044 --> 00:47:56,310
This one? Yeah, hurry it up.

1379
00:47:57,544 --> 00:47:58,577
Just a minute.

1380
00:47:58,577 --> 00:48:01,844
Honey, please cut down some time when shopping.

1381
00:48:01,844 --> 00:48:03,710
Decide beforehand what you want to buy.

1382
00:48:05,177 --> 00:48:09,410
(She must have completely forgot about that)

1383
00:48:09,777 --> 00:48:11,510
I choose a lot of things for her.

1384
00:48:11,510 --> 00:48:13,844
The shopping will end quickly when I choose for her.

1385
00:48:14,710 --> 00:48:17,210
I'm doing it to end the shopping quickly.

1386
00:48:17,210 --> 00:48:20,077
Couldn't you tell that I was uncomfortable?

1387
00:48:20,077 --> 00:48:22,277
How? In what way?

1388
00:48:22,277 --> 00:48:25,310
- I was really trying to hurry... / - When?

1389
00:48:25,310 --> 00:48:28,110
My eyes moved really fast.

1390
00:48:29,977 --> 00:48:31,977
- I tried my best. / - Shopping with a friend is best.

1391
00:48:31,977 --> 00:48:34,344
- You chose the one we liked. / - Yes, that's right.

1392
00:48:34,344 --> 00:48:35,344
You should get that one.

1393
00:48:35,344 --> 00:48:37,344
- Women think alike. / - You're right.

1394
00:48:38,877 --> 00:48:41,310
- Isn't it pretty? / - Yes. It looks good on you.

1395
00:48:41,310 --> 00:48:42,844
Find me that shop for me.

1396
00:48:43,377 --> 00:48:44,677
- I think this is right. / - It's here.

1397
00:48:44,677 --> 00:48:47,344
Honey, I think this is it.

1398
00:48:47,344 --> 00:48:48,910
- It's right. / - It is.

1399
00:48:49,510 --> 00:48:51,444
(Big smile)

1400
00:48:51,444 --> 00:48:53,244
- Let's go in. / - Great stuff.

1401
00:48:54,144 --> 00:48:57,777
(Sieun has entered the world of shopping)

1402
00:48:57,777 --> 00:48:58,644
This is...

1403
00:48:58,644 --> 00:49:01,310
I don't buy things right away.

1404
00:49:01,310 --> 00:49:02,544
Because when I was young...

1405
00:49:03,177 --> 00:49:04,610
She made a good choice buying those earrings.

1406
00:49:05,177 --> 00:49:07,144
- It goes with her entire outfit. / - It's so pretty.

1407
00:49:12,677 --> 00:49:15,410
I just buy it even if I don't like it.

1408
00:49:15,410 --> 00:49:17,577
Even if I don't like it, I buy it since I'm there.

1409
00:49:17,577 --> 00:49:21,777
But my wife doesn't buy it if she doesn't like it.

1410
00:49:21,777 --> 00:49:24,110
Then she goes back in case she regrets not buying it.

1411
00:49:24,110 --> 00:49:26,144
- He's frowning so much. / - That's right.

1412
00:49:26,144 --> 00:49:27,644
- Why do they do that? / - Frowning eyebrows...

1413
00:49:27,644 --> 00:49:29,810
Even with soy sauce.

1414
00:49:29,810 --> 00:49:30,577
Soy sauce?

1415
00:49:30,577 --> 00:49:32,177
Yes, even when she's buying soy sauce.

1416
00:49:32,177 --> 00:49:35,177
She reads up on every type of soy sauce.

1417
00:49:35,177 --> 00:49:37,344
- Goodness. / - She reads the labels?

1418
00:49:37,344 --> 00:49:37,944
Yes.

1419
00:49:37,944 --> 00:49:40,144
You can't sleep if you don't buy something.

1420
00:49:40,144 --> 00:49:42,677
- Right. / - You remember the thing you left.

1421
00:49:42,677 --> 00:49:44,744
- In case someone else buys it. / - Right.

1422
00:49:44,744 --> 00:49:47,210
(Pick everything up to look)

1423
00:49:47,210 --> 00:49:48,277
(Tap on everything interesting)

1424
00:49:48,277 --> 00:49:49,144
Is that a menu?

1425
00:49:49,644 --> 00:49:51,810
I'm not going to buy it but let me just try it on.

1426
00:49:51,810 --> 00:49:53,277
Goodness, it's so pretty.

1427
00:49:53,744 --> 00:49:55,177
You need to buy something in an accessory shop.

1428
00:49:55,177 --> 00:49:57,344
They sell so many nice things here.

1429
00:49:57,344 --> 00:49:58,310
It's not like that every day.

1430
00:49:58,310 --> 00:50:00,177
- It's only because it's cheap there. / - Yeah.

1431
00:50:00,177 --> 00:50:02,077
You do it for kicks.

1432
00:50:02,944 --> 00:50:04,410
- Honey? / - Yes?

1433
00:50:06,410 --> 00:50:10,144
(He's checking Sieun's mood with a sour face)

1434
00:50:13,144 --> 00:50:18,744
(He's leaving for somewhere without saying anything)

1435
00:50:18,744 --> 00:50:20,244
He's sitting.

1436
00:50:20,710 --> 00:50:21,977
His legs are hurting.

1437
00:50:21,977 --> 00:50:25,710
(He's alone by himself)

1438
00:50:25,710 --> 00:50:26,810
I can't believe we're back here.

1439
00:50:26,810 --> 00:50:29,010
Doesn't Penang really suit him?

1440
00:50:29,010 --> 00:50:30,444
It doesn't seem awkward.

1441
00:50:30,444 --> 00:50:32,077
He's a native.

1442
00:50:33,510 --> 00:50:34,844
- I feel like asking him, "How much?" / - Boss.

1443
00:50:34,844 --> 00:50:37,110
- He's like a tout. / - Boss.

1444
00:50:37,110 --> 00:50:37,810
"It's cheap."

1445
00:50:39,210 --> 00:50:41,077
(Sieun is taking her time looking around)

1446
00:50:41,077 --> 00:50:43,410
This was so adorable.

1447
00:50:43,810 --> 00:50:45,910
(The pot frames caught Sieun's eyes)

1448
00:50:45,910 --> 00:50:47,177
- Frames. / - Wow, that's so pretty!

1449
00:50:47,177 --> 00:50:48,644
- Aren't they pretty? / - So pretty.

1450
00:50:48,644 --> 00:50:49,877
(24 hours ago)

1451
00:50:50,377 --> 00:50:52,310
- Honey, let's buy this. / - She saw it the day before.

1452
00:50:52,310 --> 00:50:53,944
- She wanted to buy it? / - I told him...

1453
00:50:53,944 --> 00:50:56,177
- He said no and dragged me out. / - That's pretty?

1454
00:50:56,177 --> 00:50:59,210
- You think that's pretty? / - I have no clue.

1455
00:50:59,210 --> 00:51:01,277
It's not my style.

1456
00:51:01,844 --> 00:51:03,344
Why do you want to buy that?

1457
00:51:04,144 --> 00:51:07,310
- There's no reason why. / - To hang it up!

1458
00:51:07,310 --> 00:51:10,044
(I really want to buy this today)

1459
00:51:10,044 --> 00:51:11,077
Interesting.

1460
00:51:12,144 --> 00:51:13,844
These tiles are so pretty.

1461
00:51:16,510 --> 00:51:17,644
Where did he go?

1462
00:51:18,444 --> 00:51:19,610
Honey.

1463
00:51:22,410 --> 00:51:23,710
Where did he go?

1464
00:51:24,610 --> 00:51:25,810
Honey!

1465
00:51:28,110 --> 00:51:29,677
Where are you?

1466
00:51:31,010 --> 00:51:33,577
(Where would I go? I'm right here)

1467
00:51:33,910 --> 00:51:35,810
I need to bring him in.

1468
00:51:36,610 --> 00:51:39,677
(She moves to catch the shopping slave)

1469
00:51:41,044 --> 00:51:43,877
- This is how you waste time. / - I know.

1470
00:51:44,544 --> 00:51:46,710
- You could've bought several things. / - Right.

1471
00:51:46,710 --> 00:51:49,577
If he was right there, she would've bought it.

1472
00:51:49,577 --> 00:51:51,044
Where did he go?

1473
00:51:53,277 --> 00:51:55,377
(Taehyun isn't here)

1474
00:51:55,377 --> 00:51:56,510
Honey!

1475
00:51:59,377 --> 00:52:01,277
(Looking around)

1476
00:52:02,077 --> 00:52:03,410
Where did you go?

1477
00:52:04,810 --> 00:52:07,644
Taehyun has all the money. Where did he go?

1478
00:52:09,544 --> 00:52:11,777
(It seems like she is looking at something)

1479
00:52:11,777 --> 00:52:13,710
She's still shopping.

1480
00:52:14,710 --> 00:52:16,310
- Geez. / - She shops in the middle of that?

1481
00:52:16,310 --> 00:52:18,910
- Unbelievable. / - That's the one.

1482
00:52:18,910 --> 00:52:21,444
- She's still looking. / - That's what shocked me.

1483
00:52:21,444 --> 00:52:22,910
So much I missed last time.

1484
00:52:28,244 --> 00:52:29,910
Is that a fridge magnet?

1485
00:52:32,710 --> 00:52:34,444
She's full of curiosity.

1486
00:52:36,410 --> 00:52:37,944
(Oops)

1487
00:52:37,944 --> 00:52:40,144
Where did this man go?

1488
00:52:40,144 --> 00:52:42,544
He needs to bring the money for me to buy.

1489
00:52:43,777 --> 00:52:45,844
He should have left the money with me.

1490
00:52:48,744 --> 00:52:50,877
There are so many fun things here.

1491
00:52:53,977 --> 00:52:55,444
This is really cool.

1492
00:52:57,077 --> 00:52:58,977
I really want to buy this.

1493
00:53:00,244 --> 00:53:01,644
This is also pretty.

1494
00:53:03,777 --> 00:53:06,844
- Didn't she look here before? / - Seems new again.

1495
00:53:06,844 --> 00:53:08,577
How long will we have to watch this?

1496
00:53:09,577 --> 00:53:11,044
Is this a product placement for pots?

1497
00:53:12,744 --> 00:53:15,210
There are too many frames.

1498
00:53:15,210 --> 00:53:17,010
There are so many frames.

1499
00:53:18,210 --> 00:53:21,310
Why are they all in different colors?

1500
00:53:21,310 --> 00:53:23,410
This is so painful.

1501
00:53:24,177 --> 00:53:25,544
It's painful.

1502
00:53:26,777 --> 00:53:28,577
What is the color of your wallpaper?

1503
00:53:29,210 --> 00:53:29,977
White.

1504
00:53:29,977 --> 00:53:32,144
Are you discussing it with the camera director?

1505
00:53:32,844 --> 00:53:35,344
The surroundings are mint colored.

1506
00:53:35,344 --> 00:53:36,810
Mint, blue.

1507
00:53:36,810 --> 00:53:40,044
I think this will suit our house.

1508
00:53:41,710 --> 00:53:44,710
Okay, this one. The one I liked at first glance.

1509
00:53:45,510 --> 00:53:47,344
I will choose the one I liked at first glance.

1510
00:53:47,344 --> 00:53:49,110
She was just going to buy that all along.

1511
00:53:49,110 --> 00:53:50,577
I'm happy.

1512
00:53:51,444 --> 00:53:52,944
She didn't even buy a lot.

1513
00:53:53,310 --> 00:53:54,944
Sook would've bought all 20 of those.

1514
00:53:54,944 --> 00:53:56,077
I always say this.

1515
00:53:56,077 --> 00:53:57,577
I never regret after buying something.

1516
00:53:57,577 --> 00:53:59,610
- Right. / - But I have regretted not buying it.

1517
00:53:59,610 --> 00:54:01,777
- It's awkward if you only hang one. / - Yes.

1518
00:54:01,777 --> 00:54:03,810
- You have to hang at least four. / - That's right.

1519
00:54:06,610 --> 00:54:09,677
(So much time has gone by while shopping)

1520
00:54:10,610 --> 00:54:12,977
(She finally got in touch with Taehyun)

1521
00:54:13,944 --> 00:54:16,177
- Hello? / - Honey?

1522
00:54:16,177 --> 00:54:17,110
Yes?

1523
00:54:17,977 --> 00:54:19,810
- Honey. / - Yes?

1524
00:54:20,410 --> 00:54:22,544
- Honey! / - Yes?

1525
00:54:22,977 --> 00:54:24,644
What is going on here?

1526
00:54:25,144 --> 00:54:26,110
I'm sorry.

1527
00:54:26,110 --> 00:54:27,877
You'll have to explain yourself well.

1528
00:54:28,644 --> 00:54:30,044
I'm a little shocked.

1529
00:54:30,044 --> 00:54:31,977
You abandoned me in another country.

1530
00:54:31,977 --> 00:54:33,877
No, I didn't abandon you.

1531
00:54:34,510 --> 00:54:37,177
- Let's talk when you get here. / - Okay.

1532
00:54:37,177 --> 00:54:39,110
- Sieun has a great personality. / - Where did he go?

1533
00:54:39,110 --> 00:54:41,577
He has to bring something with him in this situation.

1534
00:54:41,577 --> 00:54:43,644
- You're right. / - Taehyun better be holding something.

1535
00:54:43,644 --> 00:54:45,510
Why aren't you running?

1536
00:54:47,210 --> 00:54:49,477
You abandoned me.

1537
00:54:51,344 --> 00:54:52,977
In this foreign land.

1538
00:54:53,510 --> 00:54:54,544
What happened?

1539
00:54:54,544 --> 00:54:55,677
I know what that is.

1540
00:54:55,677 --> 00:54:57,544
- Hugging before he gets hit. / - I'll tell you the truth.

1541
00:54:57,544 --> 00:54:59,544
- Sit down first. / - In case he gets in trouble.

1542
00:54:59,544 --> 00:55:01,277
Come and sit here.

1543
00:55:02,177 --> 00:55:03,310
Tell me.

1544
00:55:03,810 --> 00:55:05,444
To be honest...

1545
00:55:05,810 --> 00:55:07,644
I was here the whole time.

1546
00:55:08,144 --> 00:55:10,210
(What?)

1547
00:55:10,210 --> 00:55:12,344
- I was too hot. / - He must have a reason.

1548
00:55:12,344 --> 00:55:14,177
Look at me. What are you looking at?

1549
00:55:15,744 --> 00:55:16,844
Honey?

1550
00:55:16,844 --> 00:55:18,577
Look at my eyes and tell me.

1551
00:55:18,577 --> 00:55:19,877
It's really scary when she does that.

1552
00:55:20,544 --> 00:55:22,710
I'll tell you the truth.

1553
00:55:22,710 --> 00:55:24,844
I came back from fishing.

1554
00:55:24,844 --> 00:55:25,977
What?

1555
00:55:27,777 --> 00:55:30,944
There's a good fishing spot here.

1556
00:55:30,944 --> 00:55:32,777
What are you on about?

1557
00:55:32,777 --> 00:55:34,177
I was just here the whole time.

1558
00:55:34,177 --> 00:55:35,877
I just had some coffee.

1559
00:55:35,877 --> 00:55:37,277
- Anyway... / - Let's go.

1560
00:55:38,144 --> 00:55:39,877
I'll let you off this time.

1561
00:55:39,877 --> 00:55:41,877
Since we're doing what I want now.

1562
00:55:45,110 --> 00:55:48,277
- Honey, Batu Ferringhi. / - Yeah, this is the beach.

1563
00:55:49,044 --> 00:55:50,510
That's so pretty.

1564
00:55:50,944 --> 00:55:53,710
- There's a vacation spot there. / - This is it.

1565
00:55:53,710 --> 00:55:55,010
Isn't it? No, this is...

1566
00:55:55,010 --> 00:55:56,444
Wait, it is this. Parasailing.

1567
00:55:56,444 --> 00:55:59,744
- Batu Ferringhi... / - This must be with it.

1568
00:55:59,744 --> 00:56:03,110
- Do we have to go parasailing there? / - Parasailing...

1569
00:56:05,144 --> 00:56:10,644
(30 minutes by car from to Batu Ferringhi)

1570
00:56:13,710 --> 00:56:16,044
- The ocean is always so nice. / - Yes.

1571
00:56:16,044 --> 00:56:17,477
It looks so nice.

1572
00:56:17,477 --> 00:56:20,677
We'll enjoy the ocean.

1573
00:56:26,577 --> 00:56:27,377
(Batu Ferringhi)

1574
00:56:27,377 --> 00:56:29,144
Wow, the beach is really long.

1575
00:56:30,277 --> 00:56:32,477
Isn't it really long? It's like Haeundae.

1576
00:56:32,477 --> 00:56:36,010
- Should we walk the beach? / - Okay.

1577
00:56:36,644 --> 00:56:39,477
- It's the ocean! / - This is nice.

1578
00:56:42,044 --> 00:56:44,144
I went to the beach last week...

1579
00:56:44,144 --> 00:56:46,610
But I couldn't walk the beach once with my husband.

1580
00:56:46,610 --> 00:56:47,310
Because of the kids?

1581
00:56:47,310 --> 00:56:49,077
Yes, he was too busy playing with the kids.

1582
00:56:49,077 --> 00:56:50,444
I'm reminded now that I watch this.

1583
00:56:50,444 --> 00:56:52,277
I should really travel a lot now.

1584
00:56:52,277 --> 00:56:53,410
So nice.

1585
00:56:54,744 --> 00:56:58,044
(It's like they're on their honeymoon)

1586
00:57:00,677 --> 00:57:03,544
I think things you like are gathered over there.

1587
00:57:04,644 --> 00:57:05,444
Yeah.

1588
00:57:05,444 --> 00:57:07,144
I really wanted to try this.

1589
00:57:07,144 --> 00:57:10,210
It's time to realize your dream.

1590
00:57:11,577 --> 00:57:13,944
(You must put on safety equipment)

1591
00:57:13,944 --> 00:57:15,277
Isn't this for kids?

1592
00:57:16,177 --> 00:57:18,510
I think this is for kids.

1593
00:57:18,944 --> 00:57:20,310
He's so kind.

1594
00:57:21,944 --> 00:57:25,044
(Heading out to sea to fulfill Sieun's wish)

1595
00:57:25,510 --> 00:57:27,310
I can't believe this.

1596
00:57:27,310 --> 00:57:30,077
I can't believe I'm doing this.

1597
00:57:30,077 --> 00:57:35,677
This is unthinkable for me.

1598
00:57:36,077 --> 00:57:37,244
I'm serious.

1599
00:57:37,244 --> 00:57:41,510
It's impossible to think that I will only hang

1600
00:57:41,510 --> 00:57:44,777
on a rope and fly in the sky.

1601
00:57:44,777 --> 00:57:46,644
Why would you do this?

1602
00:57:47,744 --> 00:57:49,344
That must be ours.

1603
00:57:49,810 --> 00:57:51,944
(The parasail is almost ready to fly)

1604
00:57:51,944 --> 00:57:54,277
I had no clue my wife liked this sort of thing.

1605
00:57:54,277 --> 00:57:57,144
- For 3 years? / - I found out on this trip.

1606
00:57:57,844 --> 00:58:00,310
(Nervous)

1607
00:58:00,310 --> 00:58:01,777
(Excited)

1608
00:58:01,777 --> 00:58:02,944
This is my wife.

1609
00:58:02,944 --> 00:58:04,077
She's so excited.

1610
00:58:06,877 --> 00:58:11,044
(It's now time to fly into the sky)

1611
00:58:12,310 --> 00:58:14,310
- Honey. / - Honey.

1612
00:58:15,177 --> 00:58:16,744
You're doing this with me since

1613
00:58:16,744 --> 00:58:17,944
you're my guardian, right?

1614
00:58:17,944 --> 00:58:20,110
This is insanity!

1615
00:58:20,110 --> 00:58:22,844
I did it alone in Thailand.

1616
00:58:22,844 --> 00:58:24,044
But it's really lonely alone.

1617
00:58:24,044 --> 00:58:25,710
At first, I went up excited but then...

1618
00:58:25,710 --> 00:58:27,377
There's no one to talk to up there.

1619
00:58:27,377 --> 00:58:28,577
No one to share it with.

1620
00:58:29,844 --> 00:58:31,144
Honey.

1621
00:58:31,510 --> 00:58:34,177
He stressed whether he should join me.

1622
00:58:34,177 --> 00:58:35,677
So it's just the two of you...

1623
00:58:35,677 --> 00:58:37,210
Oh, my God!

1624
00:58:37,944 --> 00:58:39,477
Oh, my God!

1625
00:58:43,377 --> 00:58:47,444
(The boat is getting smaller)

1626
00:58:47,710 --> 00:58:49,244
Honey!

1627
00:58:49,844 --> 00:58:52,677
- We're flying! / - We're flying!

1628
00:58:52,677 --> 00:58:55,177
- Honey. / - What are we doing?

1629
00:58:58,577 --> 00:59:00,044
Honey!

1630
00:59:00,710 --> 00:59:02,477
(Taehyun seems to enjoy it more than he expected)

1631
00:59:02,477 --> 00:59:04,044
Look down!

1632
00:59:04,044 --> 00:59:06,344
(A thrilling view below their feet)

1633
00:59:07,077 --> 00:59:10,477
- Honey, isn't this great? / - It's wonderful.

1634
00:59:10,477 --> 00:59:12,810
- How is it? / - It's wonderful.

1635
00:59:12,810 --> 00:59:15,610
- Good thing you listened to your wife, right? / - No...

1636
00:59:16,977 --> 00:59:20,877
(One can enjoy this view only in the sky)

1637
00:59:21,344 --> 00:59:23,077
I recommend you to do it with another person.

1638
00:59:23,077 --> 00:59:25,310
- It's terribly boring if you do it alone. / - Right.

1639
00:59:25,310 --> 00:59:27,210
I'm fine because I'm with you.

1640
00:59:29,144 --> 00:59:33,710
(They don't fear anything because they're together)

1641
00:59:34,177 --> 00:59:37,710
When we took off, it was amazing. It was so fun.

1642
00:59:38,944 --> 00:59:43,410
As we were pushed away from the boat, we floated...

1643
00:59:43,410 --> 00:59:47,444
That feeling of flying felt amazing. Plus the wind...

1644
00:59:47,444 --> 00:59:49,677
Ocean beneath our feet.

1645
00:59:49,677 --> 00:59:53,244
That feeling of climbing higher into the sky was great.

1646
00:59:53,244 --> 00:59:55,044
It was really fun at first.

1647
00:59:55,044 --> 00:59:57,310
My wife screamed as we climbed up.

1648
00:59:57,310 --> 00:59:59,844
Then as the speed suddenly reduced...

1649
00:59:59,844 --> 01:00:01,944
It felt weird when the speed reduced.

1650
01:00:04,744 --> 01:00:06,910
I don't think people scared of heights

1651
01:00:06,910 --> 01:00:07,777
like me should do this.

1652
01:00:07,777 --> 01:00:10,044
- Are you scared? / - Yeah, I'm getting nauseous.

1653
01:00:10,044 --> 01:00:11,377
- Already? / - Yeah...

1654
01:00:12,477 --> 01:00:13,510
This isn't good.

1655
01:00:13,510 --> 01:00:15,444
- Is it too much? / - Yes, it's too much, honey.

1656
01:00:17,077 --> 01:00:18,577
Please take us down.

1657
01:00:18,944 --> 01:00:20,977
Bring us down.

1658
01:00:20,977 --> 01:00:22,610
- They have a sign, right? / - Yes.

1659
01:00:22,610 --> 01:00:24,444
- To bring you down. / - It's only been 3 minutes?

1660
01:00:24,444 --> 01:00:24,877
Yes, yes.

1661
01:00:24,877 --> 01:00:27,077
I felt really sorry up there.

1662
01:00:27,077 --> 01:00:29,777
I shouldn't have made him do it.

1663
01:00:29,777 --> 01:00:31,844
I made him do things he's so scared of.

1664
01:00:31,844 --> 01:00:33,944
It's not just being scared.

1665
01:00:33,944 --> 01:00:35,344
He's feeling it all over his body.

1666
01:00:35,344 --> 01:00:39,377
I felt bad because I felt it was my fault.

1667
01:00:39,377 --> 01:00:41,877
It was a nightmare for me as well.

1668
01:00:43,677 --> 01:00:45,144
Honey, it's going down now.

1669
01:00:45,144 --> 01:00:47,877
- I'm so... / - It's going down.

1670
01:00:52,544 --> 01:00:54,377
Yes, take deep breaths.

1671
01:00:55,244 --> 01:00:56,444
It's climbing down.

1672
01:00:57,710 --> 01:01:01,144
- I'm sorry, honey. / - This is really tough.

1673
01:01:01,144 --> 01:01:02,510
We're almost there.

1674
01:01:02,510 --> 01:01:05,144
It feels like you're getting to know each other better.

1675
01:01:05,144 --> 01:01:07,110
I really didn't know it was that bad.

1676
01:01:07,110 --> 01:01:09,877
I only found then how severe his acrophobia is.

1677
01:01:13,577 --> 01:01:16,610
(He's calmed down a little now)

1678
01:01:16,610 --> 01:01:18,277
Goodness.

1679
01:01:18,277 --> 01:01:19,810
That's really worrying.

1680
01:01:21,310 --> 01:01:23,544
It's not like I'm scared.

1681
01:01:23,544 --> 01:01:25,677
It's just a fear of heights.

1682
01:01:31,777 --> 01:01:34,177
- I'm sorry. / - Don't say that.

1683
01:01:34,677 --> 01:01:36,244
I don't think I can do it.

1684
01:01:39,810 --> 01:01:42,644
- But from his point of view... / - It's my fault.

1685
01:01:42,644 --> 01:01:44,944
He must feel so bad that you had to stop.

1686
01:01:44,944 --> 01:01:47,610
- Because of him. / - He kept saying he was sorry.

1687
01:01:47,610 --> 01:01:49,910
He's scared and sorry.

1688
01:01:58,144 --> 01:01:59,910
My wife is amazing.

1689
01:02:00,510 --> 01:02:02,977
She must've been worried that something will happen.

1690
01:02:02,977 --> 01:02:05,177
I realized that she truly is my wife.

1691
01:02:05,177 --> 01:02:06,444
I was really thankful.

1692
01:02:07,644 --> 01:02:10,044
You confirmed your love for each other.

1693
01:02:12,877 --> 01:02:15,477
They look so down after doing something so fun.

1694
01:02:16,110 --> 01:02:17,644
That's a bit sad.

1695
01:02:20,277 --> 01:02:22,310
Have a seat here, honey.

1696
01:02:24,344 --> 01:02:26,110
- It's tough. / - You did well.

1697
01:02:28,510 --> 01:02:30,610
(Taehyun had it tougher than anyone)

1698
01:02:30,610 --> 01:02:31,610
Good work.

1699
01:02:33,044 --> 01:02:34,010
I was really thankful.

1700
01:02:34,010 --> 01:02:36,510
He had clenched his fists so hard...

1701
01:02:39,944 --> 01:02:42,544
People with acrophobia should never try this.

1702
01:02:42,544 --> 01:02:45,677
- But at least I tried. / - That's right, you did.

1703
01:02:45,677 --> 01:02:48,110
- I didn't not try. / - That's right. Good work.

1704
01:02:48,110 --> 01:02:49,710
But it's really hard.

1705
01:02:51,610 --> 01:02:55,444
This program makes you want to get married.

1706
01:02:55,444 --> 01:02:58,310
I really acknowledge these two couples.

1707
01:02:58,310 --> 01:02:59,877
If you're not normally that good to each other,

1708
01:02:59,877 --> 01:03:01,277
they can't act like this here.

1709
01:03:01,277 --> 01:03:05,677
When you face danger together,

1710
01:03:05,677 --> 01:03:07,544
you come to rely on each other.

1711
01:03:09,144 --> 01:03:13,144
For that purpose, this is good for newlyweds.

1712
01:03:13,144 --> 01:03:15,244
I think it's great for married couples.

1713
01:03:15,244 --> 01:03:17,544
If you do it at sunset...

1714
01:03:17,544 --> 01:03:19,177
- It'd be so cool. / - It's really the highlight.

1715
01:03:19,177 --> 01:03:19,610
(Lively Park and Zin's healing in Penang)

1716
01:03:19,610 --> 01:03:23,910
(Dinner with a nice view)

1717
01:03:24,710 --> 01:03:29,244
(The chaotic day is now over)

1718
01:03:29,244 --> 01:03:31,710
Since today is our last day here,

1719
01:03:31,710 --> 01:03:35,510
I'd like to take you to a great dinner.

1720
01:03:35,510 --> 01:03:38,210
In fact, I have been secretly saving some money.

1721
01:03:39,977 --> 01:03:42,177
- Is it an expensive place? / - Yes, it's very expensive.

1722
01:03:42,777 --> 01:03:44,277
- Is this the place? / - Yes.

1723
01:03:44,277 --> 01:03:45,877
It says it's a seafood market.

1724
01:03:45,877 --> 01:03:48,644
- I'll treat you to a seafood market. / - I sense lobster.

1725
01:03:48,644 --> 01:03:53,010
The look of the building tells that it's a fancy place.

1726
01:03:53,010 --> 01:03:54,744
I spent a fair bit of money.

1727
01:03:55,644 --> 01:03:57,844
- It looks a bit like Thailand. / - It does.

1728
01:03:57,844 --> 01:04:01,644
Penang is a lot of countries mixed together.

1729
01:04:03,010 --> 01:04:05,010
(The entrance of the restaurant is full of fish tanks)

1730
01:04:05,777 --> 01:04:08,444
- Is that a fish tank? / - Yes, fish tank.

1731
01:04:08,444 --> 01:04:10,577
- I love places like this. / - It looks delicious.

1732
01:04:10,577 --> 01:04:13,044
- They'd really have lobster. / - They would.

1733
01:04:13,044 --> 01:04:14,677
- They have every variety. / - Honey...

1734
01:04:14,677 --> 01:04:16,510
Here's the lobster.

1735
01:04:16,510 --> 01:04:17,510
They're so big.

1736
01:04:17,510 --> 01:04:19,377
They have Chinese cuisine, Malaysian...

1737
01:04:19,377 --> 01:04:21,544
- It's a rainbow lobster. / - You choose how you want it.

1738
01:04:21,544 --> 01:04:22,510
That's right.

1739
01:04:24,244 --> 01:04:26,177
Honey, look here.

1740
01:04:26,177 --> 01:04:28,544
- There's something we must know. / - What?

1741
01:04:28,544 --> 01:04:31,844
If you look here, it's $20 for 100g.

1742
01:04:31,844 --> 01:04:33,077
- $20? / - It's extremely expensive.

1743
01:04:33,077 --> 01:04:35,044
- You can come for just that... / - What will you do?

1744
01:04:35,044 --> 01:04:36,544
- Is the food cheaper? / - Let's just eat a decent amount.

1745
01:04:36,544 --> 01:04:38,277
- Want to leave or eat? / - We have to eat.

1746
01:04:38,277 --> 01:04:40,410
- We've come all the way here. / - Really?

1747
01:04:40,410 --> 01:04:42,277
Honey, turn around!

1748
01:04:42,277 --> 01:04:44,177
- We've come too far in. / - You're right.

1749
01:04:44,177 --> 01:04:45,044
We can't go back out.

1750
01:04:45,044 --> 01:04:47,810
Rainbow, Australian or Boston?

1751
01:04:51,310 --> 01:04:53,344
Who will I choose?

1752
01:04:53,744 --> 01:04:54,310
Who will I choose?

1753
01:04:54,310 --> 01:04:57,177
It's fun for us but for them...

1754
01:04:57,177 --> 01:04:59,544
She's a very cruel woman.

1755
01:05:01,944 --> 01:05:03,644
They're so scary.

1756
01:05:06,377 --> 01:05:07,744
It's so big.

1757
01:05:09,544 --> 01:05:10,610
Let's head inside.

1758
01:05:11,077 --> 01:05:12,244
- Thank you. / - Thank you.

1759
01:05:12,244 --> 01:05:13,277
It's really big.

1760
01:05:14,210 --> 01:05:16,777
I reserved a seat for you.

1761
01:05:16,777 --> 01:05:17,877
- Even a seat? / - Yes.

1762
01:05:18,544 --> 01:05:21,244
Check out the ocean.

1763
01:05:22,310 --> 01:05:23,544
Honey.

1764
01:05:23,544 --> 01:05:27,410
Are we going to eat the lobster with this ocean view?

1765
01:05:27,410 --> 01:05:29,510
This is so nice.

1766
01:05:31,410 --> 01:05:35,010
The sunset is beautiful here but it was cloudy that day.

1767
01:05:36,510 --> 01:05:39,244
(They will have their perfect dinner here)

1768
01:05:39,810 --> 01:05:43,544
(Checking the menu)

1769
01:05:44,310 --> 01:05:46,277
- Please promise me one thing. / - What is it?

1770
01:05:46,277 --> 01:05:49,510
Please be quick to decide what to eat.

1771
01:05:50,177 --> 01:05:51,110
Please.

1772
01:05:51,977 --> 01:05:53,910
That's the hardest thing.

1773
01:05:53,910 --> 01:05:55,844
She can never choose what to eat.

1774
01:05:55,844 --> 01:05:57,010
She keeps asking for my opinion

1775
01:05:57,010 --> 01:06:00,077
but I have no idea either.

1776
01:06:00,077 --> 01:06:01,410
She always asks for my opinion.

1777
01:06:07,644 --> 01:06:09,444
Honey, what else should we order?

1778
01:06:09,444 --> 01:06:11,577
- There's so much to order here. / - I...

1779
01:06:11,577 --> 01:06:13,110
Why did you just ask me?

1780
01:06:14,777 --> 01:06:16,377
You look first.

1781
01:06:16,377 --> 01:06:19,377
Reading the menu is the best thing in the world.

1782
01:06:19,377 --> 01:06:20,544
There's so much to choose from.

1783
01:06:20,544 --> 01:06:22,877
It's my favorite book of all books.

1784
01:06:23,544 --> 01:06:25,244
I really like you.

1785
01:06:27,910 --> 01:06:29,944
- Vegetables... / - There's the clouds that you love.

1786
01:06:30,244 --> 01:06:32,577
- I should choose one with a picture. / - Yeah.

1787
01:06:33,477 --> 01:06:35,644
All he can think about is bean paste stew.

1788
01:06:36,510 --> 01:06:38,444
I think I saw a Korean restaurant on the way.

1789
01:06:38,444 --> 01:06:39,210
Tofu...

1790
01:06:39,944 --> 01:06:43,510
- Choosing the menu is a kind of shopping. / - Right.

1791
01:06:44,577 --> 01:06:46,044
Choose, I'll wait.

1792
01:06:46,044 --> 01:06:47,777
I can wait forever.

1793
01:06:51,577 --> 01:06:54,910
Let's ask the waiter what the most popular dish is.

1794
01:06:54,910 --> 01:06:56,210
Hang on a second.

1795
01:06:56,210 --> 01:06:57,977
Why did you even look at the menu then?

1796
01:06:57,977 --> 01:06:59,144
I'm just curious.

1797
01:06:59,144 --> 01:07:00,510
Why have you been looking at the menu all this time?

1798
01:07:00,510 --> 01:07:02,744
- I wanted to choose but... / - Let's discuss this.

1799
01:07:02,744 --> 01:07:05,010
Then you order. Choose from here...

1800
01:07:05,010 --> 01:07:07,610
I've already chosen. I chose as I walked in.

1801
01:07:07,610 --> 01:07:10,577
I'm going to eat this rice.

1802
01:07:10,577 --> 01:07:11,377
Me too.

1803
01:07:13,044 --> 01:07:14,910
You have a disorder with making decisions.

1804
01:07:15,344 --> 01:07:17,744
- The sun's already set. / - Yes, it went down fast.

1805
01:07:17,744 --> 01:07:19,644
- The food's not out yet? / - No.

1806
01:07:19,644 --> 01:07:20,877
They looked at the menu and the sun set.

1807
01:07:20,877 --> 01:07:22,977
I've always wanted to have a dinner

1808
01:07:22,977 --> 01:07:25,644
on the beach with the sunset.

1809
01:07:27,144 --> 01:07:27,977
It's nice.

1810
01:07:28,210 --> 01:07:30,577
I guess this is why people do this

1811
01:07:30,577 --> 01:07:33,044
on their honeymoons.

1812
01:07:35,610 --> 01:07:37,110
The sun's gone down now, honey.

1813
01:07:37,110 --> 01:07:39,110
- It's pitch black. / - You're right.

1814
01:07:41,444 --> 01:07:42,277
It's here!

1815
01:07:46,877 --> 01:07:48,477
Is the lobster finally here?

1816
01:07:48,477 --> 01:07:49,777
(Mouth wide open)

1817
01:07:49,777 --> 01:07:52,944
Unbelievable.

1818
01:07:52,944 --> 01:07:54,277
Wow, what is that?

1819
01:07:54,277 --> 01:07:55,977
I've never seen anything like that before.

1820
01:07:55,977 --> 01:07:57,777
- It was really good. / - The meat...

1821
01:07:59,744 --> 01:08:01,277
Doesn't it smell amazing?

1822
01:08:04,177 --> 01:08:06,777
(Mmm)

1823
01:08:07,277 --> 01:08:08,477
It's good.

1824
01:08:09,177 --> 01:08:11,677
(Her eyes widen)

1825
01:08:12,077 --> 01:08:14,177
(It melts in the mouth)

1826
01:08:14,177 --> 01:08:16,410
- It's good. / - It was really good.

1827
01:08:16,410 --> 01:08:19,144
Anything tastes good with butter and cheese.

1828
01:08:22,344 --> 01:08:26,110
- There's so much meat. / - There was so much.

1829
01:08:26,877 --> 01:08:28,277
That would be perfect with wine.

1830
01:08:28,277 --> 01:08:30,844
While eating this...

1831
01:08:33,010 --> 01:08:34,210
I'm reminded of Penang.

1832
01:08:35,010 --> 01:08:37,244
The more you peel back...

1833
01:08:37,244 --> 01:08:39,444
There's so much complexity under here.

1834
01:08:39,444 --> 01:08:40,677
It feels just like that.

1835
01:08:40,677 --> 01:08:42,610
I really want to try it.

1836
01:08:42,610 --> 01:08:44,610
- That looks really delicious. / - It looks so good.

1837
01:08:44,610 --> 01:08:46,544
I think Penang, Malaysia is...

1838
01:08:47,410 --> 01:08:48,844
It's so mixed here.

1839
01:08:48,844 --> 01:08:50,644
- They've worked together. / - To become one.

1840
01:08:50,644 --> 01:08:52,044
For 10, 20, 30, 40...

1841
01:08:52,044 --> 01:08:54,777
- 50, 60 years. / - That's right.

1842
01:08:54,777 --> 01:08:58,444
- They become more like each other. / - Right.

1843
01:08:58,444 --> 01:08:59,577
- And mix. / - Right.

1844
01:08:59,577 --> 01:09:01,410
It feels like that.

1845
01:09:02,244 --> 01:09:03,844
- That's Penang. / - You are correct.

1846
01:09:03,844 --> 01:09:05,677
Even if we come with kids...

1847
01:09:05,677 --> 01:09:08,144
- There's so much to do. / - Okay, okay.

1848
01:09:09,144 --> 01:09:10,544
Is the restroom outside?

1849
01:09:11,210 --> 01:09:12,510
Okay, okay.

1850
01:09:12,510 --> 01:09:14,977
Let me just take a quick bathroom break.

1851
01:09:15,577 --> 01:09:17,544
(While everyone was waiting for Taehyun)

1852
01:09:18,044 --> 01:09:20,410
I think you should check your text messages.

1853
01:09:21,710 --> 01:09:25,077
(Sieun checks her text messages with a stern look)

1854
01:09:27,477 --> 01:09:29,910
- What happened? / - What's wrong?

1855
01:09:31,477 --> 01:09:34,644
(She looks at her phone for a long time)

1856
01:09:42,577 --> 01:09:47,644
(Her eyes suddenly became teary)

1857
01:09:48,944 --> 01:09:50,177
She's crying.

1858
01:09:50,744 --> 01:09:54,810
(Someone sent her photos)

1859
01:09:58,144 --> 01:10:01,044
(She's about to burst into tears)

1860
01:10:05,710 --> 01:10:07,644
At each location!

1861
01:10:07,644 --> 01:10:09,977
He took one at each location.

1862
01:10:09,977 --> 01:10:10,810
This is good.

1863
01:10:10,810 --> 01:10:13,110
(Thank you)

1864
01:10:13,110 --> 01:10:15,710
(For living)

1865
01:10:15,710 --> 01:10:18,377
(With)

1866
01:10:18,377 --> 01:10:21,010
(Me)

1867
01:10:21,010 --> 01:10:24,044
That's so pretty.

1868
01:10:26,077 --> 01:10:27,244
That means...

1869
01:10:27,244 --> 01:10:30,710
- At every stop. / - At each location.

1870
01:10:34,544 --> 01:10:36,044
That's pretty.

1871
01:10:36,610 --> 01:10:37,677
I was really shocked.

1872
01:10:37,677 --> 01:10:40,410
- He sent each photo one by one. / - What is this?

1873
01:10:42,044 --> 01:10:45,177
- That will make you cry. / - Right.

1874
01:10:45,177 --> 01:10:48,444
(She continues to look at it for a long time)

1875
01:10:51,544 --> 01:10:53,577
When did he take these photos?

1876
01:10:54,510 --> 01:10:56,110
She usually doesn't cry.

1877
01:10:56,110 --> 01:10:57,810
I'm so lonely today.

1878
01:10:58,310 --> 01:10:59,710
Where did he go?

1879
01:11:02,177 --> 01:11:03,744
Where is he?

1880
01:11:03,744 --> 01:11:05,744
(Look to your left)

1881
01:11:07,244 --> 01:11:09,744
- Why is he running like that? / - Is he the village idiot?

1882
01:11:10,510 --> 01:11:11,710
What was that?

1883
01:11:11,710 --> 01:11:15,277
I didn't know that I ran like that.

1884
01:11:16,510 --> 01:11:19,544
(Taehyun looks nervous)

1885
01:11:19,977 --> 01:11:21,577
Geez, I usually don't do things like this.

1886
01:11:24,810 --> 01:11:26,344
Hello, My Honey.

1887
01:11:27,410 --> 01:11:30,610
It's been almost 8 years since we met.

1888
01:11:31,310 --> 01:11:33,344
Thank you for always being by my side.

1889
01:11:33,344 --> 01:11:35,244
This team is a complete drama.

1890
01:11:35,244 --> 01:11:39,010
Just like we promised,

1891
01:11:39,010 --> 01:11:41,410
let's live a meaningful and cheerful life.

1892
01:11:43,577 --> 01:11:44,710
Is Dongseok crying?

1893
01:11:46,744 --> 01:11:47,944
Why are you crying?

1894
01:11:49,544 --> 01:11:50,644
Why are you crying?

1895
01:11:50,644 --> 01:11:52,644
- Is he crying again? / - Is Dongseok crying?

1896
01:11:53,177 --> 01:11:55,310
- What's wrong with him? / - Go check on him.

1897
01:11:55,310 --> 01:11:56,744
Are you serious?

1898
01:11:56,744 --> 01:11:57,910
Why are you crying?

1899
01:11:58,577 --> 01:11:59,877
Is he really crying?

1900
01:11:59,877 --> 01:12:01,777
Why are you crying?

1901
01:12:02,177 --> 01:12:03,544
Is life too tough for you these days?

1902
01:12:04,177 --> 01:12:06,410
- Are you okay? / - It's because he ran like this.

1903
01:12:06,410 --> 01:12:09,310
Thank you for always being by my side.

1904
01:12:09,310 --> 01:12:11,510
Just like we promised before we got married...

1905
01:12:12,110 --> 01:12:13,744
Besides living well together...

1906
01:12:14,144 --> 01:12:16,344
Let's live a meaningful and cheerful life.

1907
01:12:17,177 --> 01:12:19,144
I love you, My Honey.

1908
01:12:19,144 --> 01:12:21,044
My wife, Park Sieun.

1909
01:12:21,044 --> 01:12:23,677
In our next life...

1910
01:12:24,510 --> 01:12:26,510
Please give me more allowance money.

1911
01:12:27,810 --> 01:12:29,577
I love you, My Honey.

1912
01:12:31,077 --> 01:12:33,610
- What is all this? / - What else?

1913
01:12:33,610 --> 01:12:35,410
Oh, My Honey.

1914
01:12:37,644 --> 01:12:41,977
(We could feel Taehyun's sincerity in the event)

1915
01:12:41,977 --> 01:12:44,977
- Is that what you were doing every day? / - Yeah.

1916
01:12:44,977 --> 01:12:46,844
That's what I was doing each time.

1917
01:12:46,844 --> 01:12:47,510
Goodness.

1918
01:12:47,510 --> 01:12:49,110
(One person is still touched)

1919
01:12:49,877 --> 01:12:52,444
- That's so cute. / - That's so nice.

1920
01:12:52,444 --> 01:12:53,577
Goodness, goodness.

1921
01:12:53,577 --> 01:12:56,110
- I made a request, right? / - I like seeing that.

1922
01:12:56,110 --> 01:13:00,310
In the 8 years of marriage...

1923
01:13:02,544 --> 01:13:04,610
I've hardly ever done a surprise for my wife?

1924
01:13:04,610 --> 01:13:05,444
Is that the first time?

1925
01:13:05,444 --> 01:13:08,110
- Never a surprise. / - Hardly ever.

1926
01:13:08,110 --> 01:13:09,077
Then it'd be even more moving.

1927
01:13:09,077 --> 01:13:12,944
I prefer to be a good husband every day.

1928
01:13:13,610 --> 01:13:15,577
So I've hardly ever done it...

1929
01:13:18,477 --> 01:13:21,244
(This is how Taehyun's surprise started)

1930
01:13:21,244 --> 01:13:23,510
(Step 1, cooperating with the staff)

1931
01:13:23,510 --> 01:13:24,677
Did he prepare earlier?

1932
01:13:24,677 --> 01:13:26,677
I'd like to organize a surprise for her.

1933
01:13:26,677 --> 01:13:28,710
I wrote this down.

1934
01:13:29,210 --> 01:13:30,410
That's adorable.

1935
01:13:31,610 --> 01:13:34,377
He prepared this when he was in Korea.

1936
01:13:36,477 --> 01:13:41,110
(This is how he completed it word by word)

1937
01:13:43,444 --> 01:13:46,877
(Step 2, preparing the flower bouquet)

1938
01:13:47,510 --> 01:13:48,410
Where did he go?

1939
01:13:49,044 --> 01:13:49,910
Seriously, where did he go?

1940
01:13:49,910 --> 01:13:51,944
- Oh, then! / - I felt so bad.

1941
01:13:51,944 --> 01:13:54,010
- Where's the florist? / - He went to buy it then?

1942
01:13:54,010 --> 01:13:56,610
- Then... / - It's so hard to find flowers.

1943
01:14:00,244 --> 01:14:02,410
This one.

1944
01:14:02,410 --> 01:14:03,844
She loves purple. I'm 100% sure of it.

1945
01:14:04,410 --> 01:14:06,210
That's right.

1946
01:14:06,210 --> 01:14:07,644
I felt so bad that day.

1947
01:14:07,644 --> 01:14:09,010
(Step 3, the big event)

1948
01:14:09,010 --> 01:14:11,044
- Even then... / - Is the bathroom outside?

1949
01:14:12,144 --> 01:14:13,344
Okay, okay.

1950
01:14:13,810 --> 01:14:16,877
(Everything's going as planned)

1951
01:14:17,610 --> 01:14:18,544
(Where Sieun is sitting)

1952
01:14:18,544 --> 01:14:19,277
Can you see it?

1953
01:14:20,110 --> 01:14:22,677
(He completes the final photo)

1954
01:14:23,177 --> 01:14:26,477
(Sending the photos to Sieun)

1955
01:14:26,810 --> 01:14:28,177
She saw it.

1956
01:14:28,944 --> 01:14:31,077
She saw it.

1957
01:14:31,744 --> 01:14:34,877
(Step 4, another hidden surprise)

1958
01:14:34,877 --> 01:14:37,377
I prepared this.

1959
01:14:38,610 --> 01:14:41,544
- That's your wedding photo, right?  / - Yes.

1960
01:14:42,010 --> 01:14:43,210
On the back. "I love you."

1961
01:14:43,210 --> 01:14:46,377
You took care of him like a son.

1962
01:14:47,377 --> 01:14:49,844
- What's that photo? / - This is us.

1963
01:14:52,510 --> 01:14:53,844
(Ta-da)

1964
01:14:54,977 --> 01:14:57,244
(The pose Sieun usually likes to do)

1965
01:14:58,010 --> 01:15:00,477
- That's what I do. / - That's right.

1966
01:15:01,210 --> 01:15:03,744
I'm so moved.

1967
01:15:03,744 --> 01:15:06,577
On this trip, for you and me...

1968
01:15:07,177 --> 01:15:12,144
It was a chance to get to know each other perfectly.

1969
01:15:12,610 --> 01:15:15,077
Yeah, I'm sure we'll find out new things

1970
01:15:15,077 --> 01:15:17,177
as we live together.

1971
01:15:17,177 --> 01:15:20,210
But just like the people of Penang...

1972
01:15:20,810 --> 01:15:23,510
Let's recognize each other and meet in the middle.

1973
01:15:24,210 --> 01:15:26,144
It was completely unexpected.

1974
01:15:26,144 --> 01:15:28,477
I realized this is why people do surprises.

1975
01:15:28,477 --> 01:15:30,410
As people live on...

1976
01:15:30,410 --> 01:15:33,710
It could become dull if it's done all the time.

1977
01:15:33,710 --> 01:15:37,144
But doing something small once in a while...

1978
01:15:37,144 --> 01:15:39,410
I realized you can move someone

1979
01:15:39,410 --> 01:15:41,477
with just a sketchbook.

1980
01:15:41,477 --> 01:15:44,277
I thought my wife leaned on me

1981
01:15:44,277 --> 01:15:46,044
but I realized I was leaning on her.

1982
01:15:46,044 --> 01:15:47,710
I realized that even more.

1983
01:15:48,444 --> 01:15:52,144
This tour was supposed to be us

1984
01:15:52,144 --> 01:15:54,177
moving each other.

1985
01:15:54,177 --> 01:15:57,410
But in the end, Taehyun moved Sieun.

1986
01:15:57,410 --> 01:15:59,177
(They always held hands wherever they went)

1987
01:16:01,344 --> 01:16:03,544
- It was really moving. / - So touching.

1988
01:16:03,544 --> 01:16:06,877
I think it was more about Taehyun moving me.

1989
01:16:08,210 --> 01:16:11,777
The tour name was perfect.

1990
01:16:12,244 --> 01:16:13,677
We need to find out about the costs.

1991
01:16:13,677 --> 01:16:16,310
- Since cost of living is cheap there. / - I know.

1992
01:16:16,310 --> 01:16:18,210
- In terms of money spent on food. / - Cost effective...

1993
01:16:18,210 --> 01:16:20,377
If you have time, you should visit both places.

1994
01:16:20,377 --> 01:16:21,744
I really want to do that.

1995
01:16:21,744 --> 01:16:23,610
You'll have to be jobless to do that.

1996
01:16:24,077 --> 01:16:25,010
You need to be rich too.

1997
01:16:25,010 --> 01:16:28,310
Let's hear the total expense from Sieun.

1998
01:16:28,310 --> 01:16:31,644
For 3 days and 2 nights, the Lively Park and Zin Tour

1999
01:16:31,644 --> 01:16:32,710
spent a total of this much at Penang.

2000
01:16:32,710 --> 01:16:35,477
- Excluding airfares. / - Excluding airfares.

2001
01:16:35,977 --> 01:16:37,877
- Total. / - Per person.

2002
01:16:37,877 --> 01:16:41,644
$396.50.

2003
01:16:41,644 --> 01:16:44,077
- My goodness. / - You did all that for $390?

2004
01:16:44,077 --> 01:16:46,077
- It was less than $400? / - $396.50.

2005
01:16:46,077 --> 01:16:50,577
If it's $396.50, that includes the lobster you ate.

2006
01:16:50,577 --> 01:16:51,310
Yes.

2007
01:16:51,310 --> 01:16:53,910
That lobster was $200. Then without that, $190?

2008
01:16:53,910 --> 01:16:56,244
It means there really isn't much to spend.

2009
01:16:56,244 --> 01:16:57,110
That's so affordable.

2010
01:16:57,110 --> 01:17:00,677
- Since food is so cheap. / - The noodles were $1.80.

2011
01:17:00,677 --> 01:17:02,810
That entire meal was only $10.

2012
01:17:03,344 --> 01:17:06,244
Next week...

2013
01:17:06,244 --> 01:17:07,610
- Another special? / - It's another special.

2014
01:17:07,610 --> 01:17:10,044
- This is a real. / - It's a real special.

2015
01:17:10,044 --> 01:17:11,710
This week was real too.

2016
01:17:11,710 --> 01:17:14,610
But this is really, really real.

2017
01:17:14,610 --> 01:17:16,544
It's really true.

2018
01:17:16,544 --> 01:17:18,510
Vietnam and the Philippines.

2019
01:17:18,510 --> 01:17:21,544
A true trip planned by real people.

2020
01:17:21,544 --> 01:17:23,477
Look out for it.

2021
01:17:23,477 --> 01:17:24,910
Please look forward to the next episode.

2022
01:17:24,910 --> 01:17:26,344
We'll say good-bye here.

2023
01:17:26,344 --> 01:17:28,210
The world is your school. Life is a journey.

2024
01:17:28,210 --> 01:17:30,877
Battle Trip!

2025
01:17:34,410 --> 01:17:35,377
(Next episode)

2026
01:17:35,377 --> 01:17:36,510
You can experience the magnificence of Vietnam

2027
01:17:36,510 --> 01:17:38,444
that others haven't experienced.

2028
01:17:39,744 --> 01:17:40,410
(Hanoi, Choi Eunyeong, Ahn Sunyeong)

2029
01:17:40,410 --> 01:17:41,144
(Boracay, Boom, Lee Jihye)

2030
01:17:41,744 --> 01:17:43,610
Something a little different.

2031
01:17:43,610 --> 01:17:44,677
Places that haven't been visited.

2032
01:17:45,744 --> 01:17:47,377
Isn't it so pretty?

2033
01:17:47,377 --> 01:17:50,277
We're seeing a new Boracay.

2034
01:17:50,277 --> 01:17:52,644
I'll remember this for life.

2035
01:17:53,877 --> 01:17:55,777
(Battle Trip)

2036
