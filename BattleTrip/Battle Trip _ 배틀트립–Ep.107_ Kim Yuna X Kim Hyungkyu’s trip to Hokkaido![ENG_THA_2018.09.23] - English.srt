1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,774
- Kota Kinabalu. / - This is nice. 

2
00:00:02,774 --> 00:00:04,174
This is our 30th anniversary... 

3
00:00:04,174 --> 00:00:05,674
Let's have a wonderful trip. 

4
00:00:05,674 --> 00:00:07,940
I want to travel as a woman. 

5
00:00:09,407 --> 00:00:10,874
It's our 30th anniversary... 

6
00:00:10,874 --> 00:00:11,907
Like a model... 

7
00:00:12,574 --> 00:00:13,807
1, 2, 3. 

8
00:00:13,807 --> 00:00:15,040
- This is painful. / - Smile. 

9
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:17,407
We'll remember this for a long time. 

10
00:00:17,407 --> 00:00:20,707
You're the best, Yangrak. 

11
00:00:20,707 --> 00:00:22,974
(Which team will win?) 

12
00:00:25,007 --> 00:00:28,107
(Numerous great tips on trips) 

13
00:00:30,007 --> 00:00:31,574
(Paeng Hyeonsuk, Choi Yangrak) 

14
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:33,674
(Kim Hyungkyu, Kim Yuna) 

15
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:35,640
Travel is war. 

16
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:38,374
Battle Trip! 

17
00:00:39,407 --> 00:00:40,607
Continuing from last week, 

18
00:00:40,607 --> 00:00:43,340
we're with the trip planners who have planned 

19
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:44,474
romantic getaways for married couples. 

20
00:00:44,474 --> 00:00:47,707
- Welcome. / - It's nice to meet you. 

21
00:00:47,707 --> 00:00:51,174
Also, we have our 100 impartial judges 

22
00:00:51,174 --> 00:00:53,174
who will vote on today's trip. 

23
00:00:53,174 --> 00:00:55,207
- Welcome. / - Welcome. 

24
00:00:56,174 --> 00:00:58,807
Hyejung, how was the Balu Tour from last week? 

25
00:00:58,807 --> 00:01:02,874
They took commemoration wedding photos... 

26
00:01:02,874 --> 00:01:04,640
- In the last part of the Balu Tour. / - Yes. 

27
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:09,007
When I saw that, I realized that it's best... 

28
00:01:09,007 --> 00:01:11,107
- To capture memories with photos. / - That's right. 

29
00:01:11,107 --> 00:01:13,240
- Only photos remain later. / - That's right. 

30
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:15,140
It's not common for married couples 

31
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:16,740
to go on a trip alone, right? 

32
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:19,807
There are times when a married couple would... 

33
00:01:19,807 --> 00:01:20,940
- Go on trips with their married friends. / - Together. 

34
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:23,507
- They don't go by themselves. / - Not by themselves. 

35
00:01:23,507 --> 00:01:25,374
- So I think it's more meaningful. / - That's right. 

36
00:01:25,374 --> 00:01:28,474
When I saw their trip last week, 

37
00:01:28,474 --> 00:01:30,674
I thought it would be nice if they went on more trips... 

38
00:01:30,674 --> 00:01:34,040
- Since they're young and healthy. / - That's right. 

39
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:36,674
- That doesn't only apply for you. / - Thank you. 

40
00:01:36,674 --> 00:01:38,374
- That's right. / - I think every... 

41
00:01:38,374 --> 00:01:40,340
- Korean married couple's like that. / - That's right. 

42
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:43,207
- We should enjoy more. / - Yes, we should. 

43
00:01:43,574 --> 00:01:46,907
- I wish that would happen. / - It must've been ages... 

44
00:01:46,907 --> 00:01:48,740
Since Hyungkyu and Yuna went on a trip 

45
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:50,307
without their child, right? 

46
00:01:50,307 --> 00:01:51,740
- Yes, that's right. / - How long has it been? 

47
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:53,774
Our child is 12 years old. 

48
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:56,074
- It's been 12 years. / - Is he already 12 years old? 

49
00:01:56,074 --> 00:01:57,474
- You never went by yourselves? / - It's the first time. 

50
00:01:57,474 --> 00:01:58,240
No. 

51
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:00,707
- Aren't you curious how it will be? / - We're better. 

52
00:02:00,707 --> 00:02:03,040
- Really? / - We went 4 years ago. 

53
00:02:04,174 --> 00:02:06,740
My wife went through a lot when we moved. 

54
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:08,507
So we left the kids and went to Singapore. 

55
00:02:08,507 --> 00:02:12,507
- That's nice. / - He complains but he's good. 

56
00:02:12,507 --> 00:02:13,840
- That's right. / - We had... 

57
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,807
- A big fight there though. / - Gosh. 

58
00:02:15,807 --> 00:02:17,374
- A big fight? / - Yes, a big fight. 

59
00:02:17,374 --> 00:02:19,674
- That happens. / - What do you usually fight about? 

60
00:02:19,674 --> 00:02:22,640
There are certain things you shouldn't say on a trip. 

61
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,274
- What are those? / - "Hey." 

62
00:02:24,974 --> 00:02:27,740
- "You said you knew this place." / - That's the worst. 

63
00:02:27,974 --> 00:02:29,540
- That's the worst. / - You're right. 

64
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:31,640
- "You wanted to come here." / - That's the worst. 

65
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:33,807
- "You said you knew this place." / - The worst. 

66
00:02:33,807 --> 00:02:35,707
- After all that work. / - "I knew this would happen." 

67
00:02:35,707 --> 00:02:37,107
- Things like that. / - Yes. 

68
00:02:37,107 --> 00:02:38,374
- You have to be careful. / - That's the worst. 

69
00:02:38,374 --> 00:02:40,940
- That's annoying. / - What's so funny is that... 

70
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:42,774
- When married couples fight... / - Yes. 

71
00:02:42,774 --> 00:02:45,974
They forget why they fought the next day. 

72
00:02:45,974 --> 00:02:48,140
- They fight over trivial things. / - It's that trivial. 

73
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:50,074
- Really? / - What do you fight about? 

74
00:02:50,074 --> 00:02:51,407
Like I just said, I don't remember why we fought. 

75
00:02:51,407 --> 00:02:52,274
- That's right. / - Really? 

76
00:02:52,274 --> 00:02:54,707
- Love fights. / - Maybe you just have a bad memory. 

77
00:02:54,707 --> 00:02:57,174
- It's trivial. / - Do you have to remember that? 

78
00:02:57,907 --> 00:02:59,007
- That's right. / - Not yet... 

79
00:02:59,007 --> 00:03:00,740
Have you ever fought on a trip? 

80
00:03:01,007 --> 00:03:03,074
- I don't think they will fight. / - We have a similar tastes... 

81
00:03:03,074 --> 00:03:05,340
- When it comes to traveling. / - They won't fight then. 

82
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:07,274
For example, we like to find good food. 

83
00:03:07,274 --> 00:03:09,807
- You like comics. / - We like to drink alcohol. 

84
00:03:09,807 --> 00:03:11,674
- We also like comic books. / - No reason to fight. 

85
00:03:11,674 --> 00:03:13,607
We have similar goals. 

86
00:03:13,607 --> 00:03:15,440
- So we don't fight on trips. / - That's important. 

87
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,807
Some people don't like good restaurants. 

88
00:03:17,807 --> 00:03:20,007
- That's right. / - They don't like to wait in line. 

89
00:03:20,007 --> 00:03:21,707
"Do we have to wait in line for 2 hours to eat this?" 

90
00:03:21,707 --> 00:03:23,507
- "Let's just go somewhere else." / - That's Yangrak. 

91
00:03:23,507 --> 00:03:26,840
We knew where the past trip planners of Battle Trip... 

92
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:29,374
- Went in Hokkaido. / - You knew. 

93
00:03:29,874 --> 00:03:32,040
We took care... 

94
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:34,407
- To make it feel fresh. / - Did you avoid those places? 

95
00:03:34,407 --> 00:03:36,740
We chose things that will make you feel interested 

96
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:38,207
and brought them here. 

97
00:03:38,207 --> 00:03:40,007
- We took time. / - What if you're the only one... 

98
00:03:40,007 --> 00:03:41,674
- Who thinks like that? / - No. 

99
00:03:41,907 --> 00:03:43,307
I'm not the only one who thinks like this. 

100
00:03:43,307 --> 00:03:46,107
- Maybe we both got it wrong. / - He picked on me before. 

101
00:03:46,107 --> 00:03:49,707
Is there a reason why Hokkaido is voted 

102
00:03:49,707 --> 00:03:51,940
as a good place to travel for couples? 

103
00:03:53,007 --> 00:03:54,940
The natural environment's amazing. 

104
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:57,974
- That's right. / - The land is very big. 

105
00:03:57,974 --> 00:03:59,374
There's a lot of places to go. 

106
00:03:59,374 --> 00:04:00,607
They even have a plain... 

107
00:04:00,607 --> 00:04:02,107
- The sea... / - They even have mountains. 

108
00:04:02,107 --> 00:04:05,007
And also mountains. You can also taste all sorts... 

109
00:04:05,007 --> 00:04:07,040
- Of delicious food there. / - Everything tastes great. 

110
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,474
- I'm looking forward to it... / - Yes. 

111
00:04:09,474 --> 00:04:12,440
Because she likes eating shows, and she likes to eat. 

112
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:13,340
I do. 

113
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:14,807
- She doesn't look like that. / - She's very thin. 

114
00:04:14,807 --> 00:04:16,574
- No. / - When I pick a destination... 

115
00:04:16,574 --> 00:04:20,674
I exclude places where the food doesn't seem good. 

116
00:04:20,674 --> 00:04:22,840
- Food is the most important. / - It's important. 

117
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:24,740
We usually talk about how the trip was 

118
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:26,340
before we start shooting. 

119
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:27,107
I asked them, "How was it?" 

120
00:04:27,107 --> 00:04:29,174
They kept saying, "The food was so delicious." 

121
00:04:29,174 --> 00:04:31,607
- And "I want to go there now." / - All about the food. 

122
00:04:31,607 --> 00:04:35,674
I had the best ramen of my life. 

123
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:39,640
I usually don't like vegetables. 

124
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:40,707
I prefer meat. 

125
00:04:40,707 --> 00:04:45,240
I was shocked by the vegetable dishes... 

126
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:48,374
- Were you surprised? / - And other dishes I ate there. 

127
00:04:48,374 --> 00:04:50,540
- The best vegetable of his life? / - It was the best. 

128
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:53,240
Since we're talking about the best vegetable of his life, 

129
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:57,440
I ate the best seafood of my life. 

130
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,540
It was my first time eating this. 

131
00:04:59,874 --> 00:05:02,074
I want to appreciate it again by watching the video. 

132
00:05:02,074 --> 00:05:03,974
- The best seafood of your life. / - The best seafood. 

133
00:05:03,974 --> 00:05:05,174

134
00:05:05,174 --> 00:05:06,974
We will reveal a little more. 

135
00:05:06,974 --> 00:05:09,240
There are 3 best night views 

136
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:12,307
in Japan that are well known. 

137
00:05:12,307 --> 00:05:13,974
We'll introduce the night view. 

138
00:05:13,974 --> 00:05:16,107
The lavender garden... 

139
00:05:16,107 --> 00:05:18,107
- Is really famous in Hokkaido. / - That's right. 

140
00:05:18,107 --> 00:05:20,374

- And relaxed. / - That's nice. 

147
00:05:34,307 --> 00:05:36,974
Also, we both like comic books. 

148
00:05:36,974 --> 00:05:38,640
Man Man Tour also means 

149
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:40,574
"Comic books are the best." 

150
00:05:41,307 --> 00:05:42,907
That's perfect. 

151
00:05:43,974 --> 00:05:45,174
Goodness. 

152
00:05:45,174 --> 00:05:47,707
- Let's see it. / - Let's see the Hokkaido trip... 

153

I'm also a dentist, 

161
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:16,440
an entertainer and Yuna's manager. 

162
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:17,940
I'm Kim Hyungkyu, nice to meet you. 

163
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:19,540
(Dentist, entertainer, manager and husband) 

164
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:21,874
That's right, he's her manager.

169
00:06:31,307 --> 00:06:35,474
Not many things changed after the wedding. 

170
00:06:35,474 --> 00:06:38,274
Except the fact that we live together. 

171
00:06:38,274 --> 00:06:40,807
Thankfully, we have similar preferences 

172
00:06:40,807 --> 00:06:45,940
in movies, music and comic books. 

173
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:47,507
They are almost identical. 

174
00:06:47,507 --> 00:06:48,407
That's why... 

175
00:06:48,407 --> 00:06:51,374
It feels like I got married... 

176
00:06:52,307 --> 00:06:53,607
To the most similar friend to me. 

177
00:06:54,374 --> 00:06:57,207
It's fun because of that. 

178
00:06:57,207 --> 00:06:58,707
It's always fun. 

179
00:06:58,707 --> 00:07:00,774
I can't rest even when I sleep while 

180
00:07:00,774 --> 00:07:01,840
I'm working on an album. 

181
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:04,207
- I keep thinking even when sleeping. / - The melodies. 

182
00:07:04,207 --> 00:07:07,407
When I spend several months like that, 

183
00:07:07,407 --> 00:07:10,240
I need something to liberate myself. 

184
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,940
So I endure by thinking 

185
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:15,807
that I can go on a trip after this. 

186
00:07:15,807 --> 00:07:19,307
We went to Tokyo in Japan for our first trip. 

187
00:07:19,307 --> 00:07:22,540
- We went to Gangneung in 2007. / - In summer. 

188
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:26,874
It was the last trip we went by ourselves. After that... 

189
00:07:26,874 --> 00:07:29,174
- We never went by ourselves. / - Not once. 

190
00:07:29,174 --> 00:07:32,140
After Minjae was born, we went on a lot of trips... 

191
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:33,974
- With him. / - If the child is young... 

192
00:07:33,974 --> 00:07:35,674
It's hard to go by yourselves leaving him behind. 

193
00:07:35,674 --> 00:07:37,874
- That's right. / - It's not easy. 

194
00:07:37,874 --> 00:07:39,540
It's good that you went on this trip. 

195
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:40,974
We enjoyed it thanks to you. 

196
00:07:40,974 --> 00:07:42,740
We're going to leave... 

197
00:07:43,074 --> 00:07:47,940
- Minjae behind for this trip. / - That's right. 

198
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:49,840
If the destination is too far... 

199
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,840
- And we move too far... / - The time... 

200
00:07:52,074 --> 00:07:54,707
I think it will be hard to choose as a destination. 

201
00:07:54,707 --> 00:07:56,774
What place is cool and near? 

202
00:07:56,774 --> 00:07:58,674
A cool place would be... 

203
00:07:58,674 --> 00:08:01,440
Hokkaido in Japan? 

204
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,607
(A cool and near place, Hokkaido) 

205
00:08:02,607 --> 00:08:03,640
- Wait a minute. / - Hokkaido. 

206
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:06,240
We love Hokkaido but 

207
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,307
we've only been there in winter. 

208
00:08:07,307 --> 00:08:08,574
- People usually go in the winter. / - We went in winter. 

209
00:08:08,574 --> 00:08:11,140
I think it will be charming in the summer too. 

210
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:14,074
(Yuna really loves Hokkaido) 

211
00:08:14,074 --> 00:08:16,774
We went there a couple of times with my family. 

212
00:08:16,774 --> 00:08:19,074
- With the family. / - We only went there in winter. 

213
00:08:22,107 --> 00:08:26,174
(You can enjoy the white beauty of winter) 

214
00:08:26,174 --> 00:08:32,807
(And the freshness of summer in Hokkaido) 

215
00:08:33,207 --> 00:08:35,574
- We have a lot of memories there. / - Wait a minute. 

216
00:08:35,574 --> 00:08:37,774
- You've been there twice already? / - Yes. 

217
00:08:37,774 --> 00:08:38,507
Only in winter though. 

218
00:08:39,007 --> 00:08:40,340
I heard that... 

219
00:08:41,007 --> 00:08:42,940
Corn is delicious in summer. 

220
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:45,274
Is corn the best vegetable of your life? 

221
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:47,040
You'll find out when you watch it. 

222
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:49,907
They have different kinds of corn from Korea. 

223
00:08:50,307 --> 00:08:53,340
They say it's really good. Also, the dairy products. 

224
00:08:54,407 --> 00:08:55,907
- That's right. / - Dairy products are famous there. 

225
00:08:55,907 --> 00:08:57,674
Ice cream is delicious there. 

226
00:08:57,674 --> 00:08:59,440
- Butter is also delicious. / - Yes, butter. 

227
00:09:00,174 --> 00:09:02,074
- I can only think about corn right now. / - Corns? 

228
00:09:02,074 --> 00:09:04,007
- I want to eat corn. / - In my case... 

229
00:09:04,007 --> 00:09:05,107
And potatoes. 

230
00:09:05,107 --> 00:09:07,440
- Hokkaido potatoes are really delicious. / - I heard. 

231
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,840
- So... / - There's the Sapporo Beer Festival. 

232
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,374
(Let's celebrate the Sapporo Beer Festival) 

233
00:09:11,374 --> 00:09:12,474
- Yes. / - Yes. 

234
00:09:12,807 --> 00:09:14,174
Let's drink in the daytime. 

235
00:09:14,174 --> 00:09:16,407
- In the daytime? / - Is it time for the beer festival? 

236
00:09:16,407 --> 00:09:17,740
- It's around this time of the year. / - It's around now. 

237
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:19,940
- It's over now though. / - It's a summer beer festival. 

238
00:09:20,474 --> 00:09:23,607
You have to eat a lot of fresh seafood 

239
00:09:23,607 --> 00:09:24,940
when you're in Hokkaido. 

240
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:25,974
You have to eat seafood. 

241
00:09:25,974 --> 00:09:27,074
We must eat seafood... 

242
00:09:27,074 --> 00:09:28,407
Go to the beer festival in the day. 

243
00:09:28,407 --> 00:09:29,807
There is so much to eat. 

244
00:09:29,807 --> 00:09:33,107
We're coming up with a schedule. 

245
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:36,074
In some ways, my wife... 

246
00:09:36,374 --> 00:09:43,074
Always came up with a trip plan until now. 

247
00:09:43,074 --> 00:09:45,474
For this trip... 

248
00:09:46,707 --> 00:09:47,907
I'll try... 

249
00:09:48,107 --> 00:09:51,274
Planning the schedule. 

250
00:09:51,807 --> 00:09:52,940
Do you think you will do a good job? 

251
00:09:54,507 --> 00:09:55,474
I'll try. 

252
00:09:56,074 --> 00:09:57,107
Would you like that? 

253
00:09:57,107 --> 00:09:58,840
- Yes. Alright. / - Trust me. 

254
00:09:59,574 --> 00:10:01,074
- Good. / - Please plan a good trip. 

255
00:10:01,074 --> 00:10:03,140
- Good. / - They're not like a married couple. 

256
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:05,240
- They're not. / - They're like friends. 

257
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,640
They're like really old friends. 

258
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,840
- Are those comic books? / - Yes, it's my room. 

259
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:10,440
- Are they all comic books? / - Yes. 

260
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:12,440
- He really is an aficionado. / - He really is. 

261
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:16,807
I'm the trip planner of Man Man Tour, 

262
00:10:16,807 --> 00:10:17,807
Kim Hyungkyu. 

263
00:10:18,207 --> 00:10:20,674
I lost all the data I had. 

264
00:10:20,874 --> 00:10:24,040
I'll update the information... 

265
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:26,807
From the comic books. 

266
00:10:26,807 --> 00:10:28,607
- Comic books? / - I picked... 

267
00:10:29,107 --> 00:10:31,374
The books I'm going to bring... 

268
00:10:32,207 --> 00:10:33,540
To the trip. 

269
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:35,974
I got information from the comic books. 

270
00:10:36,707 --> 00:10:38,807
He really loves comic books. 

271
00:10:38,807 --> 00:10:39,807
Ta-da. 

272
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:42,907
It's a travel guidebook to Hokkaido. 

273
00:10:42,907 --> 00:10:46,407
It's from spring, 2015. 

274
00:10:46,607 --> 00:10:47,840
Let me cook something delicious. 

275
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:51,474
- Why is he suddenly cooking? / - What is he doing? 

276
00:10:51,474 --> 00:10:53,540
Minjae asked me to cook some dumplings. 

277
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:55,440
So I was cooking dumplings. 

278
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,707
- Now... / - He looks different in the gown. 

279
00:11:00,707 --> 00:11:01,940
- This is your clinic. / - Yes. 

280
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:03,707
You weren't working in the clinic but doing that? 

281
00:11:04,674 --> 00:11:06,907
- It was after I dealt with the patients. / - Right. 

282
00:11:06,907 --> 00:11:07,807
I was having a break. 

283
00:11:07,807 --> 00:11:10,740
Based on the comic books we like, 

284
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:13,274
we're going to have some farm experiences. 

285
00:11:13,374 --> 00:11:15,707
These are all 5-seater and 7-seater cars. 

286
00:11:16,107 --> 00:11:18,340
On the first day, we'll go drink beer. 

287
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:21,207
I have a feeling that he's plan will be so good. 

288
00:11:21,207 --> 00:11:23,107
After drinking beer, we'll go to an observatory. 

289
00:11:23,107 --> 00:11:24,207
(During the break at work, he plans the trip) 

290
00:11:24,207 --> 00:11:26,040
After the observatory, 

291
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:28,807
if we have enough time, we'll go to a bar. 

292
00:11:28,807 --> 00:11:30,207
It sounds like it's mostly about alcohol. 

293
00:11:30,207 --> 00:11:32,540
It's perfect. On the second day... 

294
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:34,340
On the second day, we should rent a car. 

295
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:36,007
Did you plan the whole trip alone? 

296
00:11:36,374 --> 00:11:39,074
We agreed that I plan the trip this time. 

297
00:11:39,574 --> 00:11:40,907
Since you're meticulous. 

298
00:11:40,907 --> 00:11:42,740
We'll observe the nature and... 

299
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:44,707
(This is beyond perfect) 

300
00:11:44,707 --> 00:11:46,440
It's perfect. It's perfect. 

301
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:48,274
(Man Man Tour, Hokkaido specialty) 

302
00:11:48,274 --> 00:11:49,674
(Beer festival) 

303
00:11:49,674 --> 00:11:51,307
(Night view) 

304
00:11:51,307 --> 00:11:54,574
(Robatayaki) 

305
00:11:54,574 --> 00:11:56,240
(Visit to a farm) 

306
00:11:56,907 --> 00:11:58,574
What's that? Was it a picture just now? 

307
00:11:58,574 --> 00:12:00,640
(Top 3 ramens in Hokkaido) 

308
00:12:01,574 --> 00:12:03,240
I want to go back. 

309
00:12:03,774 --> 00:12:05,340
When you want to go back, 

310
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:07,574
it means you really had a great time there. 

311
00:12:10,274 --> 00:12:12,340
- Ta-da. / - Yes! 

312
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:14,240
We're here. 

313
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,474
- We arrived. / - It's Hokkaido. 

314
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,474
I'm a little worried 

315
00:12:18,474 --> 00:12:21,240
the clothes I brought are not warm enough. 

316
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,840
- Was it 21?? / - Will it be cold? 

317
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:24,374
- It was very cool there. / - It was sweltering hot here. 

318
00:12:24,374 --> 00:12:26,040
- It was 40??here. / - There was a heat wave here. 

319
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:27,607
It's cold there. It was so different there. 

320
00:12:27,607 --> 00:12:29,807
- Let's take the JR Train to the downtown. / - Good. 

321
00:12:29,807 --> 00:12:31,607
- I like the JR Train. / - Shall we? 

322
00:12:31,607 --> 00:12:33,274
- Let's go. / - Go, go. 

323
00:12:33,274 --> 00:12:36,040
That'd be better than taking a car. It takes 1 hour. 

324
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:38,040
- It is. / - There's no traffic jam either. 

325
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:44,240
There's a transportation card called Kitaca card. 

326
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,874
You travel faster with it. 

327
00:12:45,874 --> 00:12:49,040
After the trip, you can keep it until the next trip. 

328
00:12:49,707 --> 00:12:51,474
You can also use it in convenience stores. 

329
00:12:51,474 --> 00:12:55,540
We take this JR Train for about 40 minutes. 

330
00:12:56,174 --> 00:12:57,574
- That's a quick trip. / - It is. 

331
00:12:58,207 --> 00:13:00,240
Let's go. 

332
00:13:01,607 --> 00:13:06,207
(It's their first trip alone in 12 years) 

333
00:13:06,407 --> 00:13:09,007
It must be nice to ride a train with your partner. 

334
00:13:09,007 --> 00:13:10,540
- Right? / - It was really nice. 

335
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:13,207
After 40 minutes, you arrive at Sapporo Station. 

336
00:13:13,207 --> 00:13:14,674
- Sapporo. / - Sapporo Station. 

337
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,940
We arrived at Sapporo Station. 

338
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:19,240
The weather is so nice. 

339
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:20,774
(The nice weather makes them feel good) 

340
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:23,507
I shouldn't be like this. 

341
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:26,174
- Anyway... / - The weather is nice. 

342
00:13:26,174 --> 00:13:28,607
- We're hungry, so... / - Mr. Planner. Yes. 

343
00:13:28,607 --> 00:13:30,340
Today, we're going to have a romantic day... 

344
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:32,840
- And eat many different things. / - Romantic? 

345
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:34,907
We're going to have a romantic day while eating a lot? 

346
00:13:34,907 --> 00:13:36,740
- Because we love food. / - We do. 

347
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:39,940
- How romantic. / - First, we'll eat corn. 

348
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:42,607
- Corn is the specialty here. / - The reason for our trip. 

349
00:13:42,707 --> 00:13:48,574
(Man Man Tour, Hokkaido specialty) 

350
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,374
(Sapporo Station) 

351
00:13:51,374 --> 00:13:53,907
Do you see that thing on the left? 

352
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:56,974
- It's so cool. / - There's a tower there. 

353
00:13:56,974 --> 00:13:59,340
It's the television tower. 

354
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:01,674
It's the television tower of Sapporo. 

355
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:05,474
Do you remember we once took a picture here? 

356
00:14:05,474 --> 00:14:07,274
We took a picture in front of the tower. 

357
00:14:07,274 --> 00:14:09,540
- We took a picture here. / - We did. 

358
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:12,874
We took that not long after we got married. 

359
00:14:12,874 --> 00:14:13,974
- In winter. / - It was winter. 

360
00:14:13,974 --> 00:14:15,407
That was early 2007. 

361
00:14:15,407 --> 00:14:17,407
You guys look frighteningly the same as now. 

362
00:14:18,274 --> 00:14:19,774
You haven't changed. 

363
00:14:19,774 --> 00:14:21,940
There's a reason why we came here today. 

364
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:24,107
- There's a reason why... / - Corn. 

365
00:14:24,107 --> 00:14:25,407
- Right. / - Corn. 

366
00:14:25,407 --> 00:14:28,640
One of the most delicious foods they have here is... 

367
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:30,040
It's corn. 

368
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:31,640
- Corn. / - Corn. 

369
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:34,974
- So... / - There's a corn vendor. 

370
00:14:34,974 --> 00:14:37,640
- Hello. / - Hello. 

371
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:40,540
It's somehow... 

372
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:43,540
There are so many tasty-looking things. Look. 

373
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:46,207
There's even a half and half deal. 

374
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:49,974
(She orders in Japanese without any problem) 

375
00:14:49,974 --> 00:14:52,240
She looks like a Japanese. 

376
00:14:53,207 --> 00:14:54,340
(Half and half, $3.50) 

377
00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:55,640
(Potato and corn, $3) 

378
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:56,907
(Grilled corn, $3) 

379
00:14:56,907 --> 00:14:58,274
(Total, $9.50) 

380
00:14:58,274 --> 00:15:00,974
I actually didn't understand why you would 

381
00:15:00,974 --> 00:15:03,740
travel all the way to Japan just for this. 

382
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:04,874
However... 

383
00:15:05,874 --> 00:15:07,740
- It looks so good. / - It looks delicious. 

384
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,740
- Look at this. / - Let me put this aside. 

385
00:15:11,774 --> 00:15:13,507
- Look at the color. / - It looks delicious. 

386
00:15:13,507 --> 00:15:15,374
You can tell it's good by the color. 

387
00:15:16,974 --> 00:15:19,974
In Korea, we also grow Chodang corn in Haenam. 

388
00:15:19,974 --> 00:15:23,074
I think Chodang corn and this corn are related. 

389
00:15:23,074 --> 00:15:25,607
It's sweet and crispy. 

390
00:15:25,607 --> 00:15:27,007
Let's start with the steamed corn first. 

391
00:15:27,007 --> 00:15:27,874
(Steamed corn first to taste the natural flavor) 

392
00:15:27,874 --> 00:15:29,674
- This one. / - Let's try... 

393
00:15:29,674 --> 00:15:31,974
- The steamed corn. / - We have... 

394
00:15:31,974 --> 00:15:34,340
- One each. / - Good. 

395
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:36,574
I think we can make this into one. Hang on a second. 

396
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:39,007
- Hang on. / - She started first. 

397
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:39,840
(I'm already eating) 

398
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:40,840
Is it good? 

399
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:43,007
(She's expressing how good the corn tastes) 

400
00:15:43,007 --> 00:15:45,474
- Is it good? / - This is not corn. 

401
00:15:45,474 --> 00:15:47,874
Hang on a second. I haven't started yet. 

402
00:15:47,874 --> 00:15:49,340
- His face got bigger. / - He's feeling rushed. 

403
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:55,207
Oh, my. I thought he was a squirrel. 

404
00:15:55,507 --> 00:15:57,007
- I was... / - My goodness. 

405
00:15:57,340 --> 00:15:59,274
- It was so good. / - Really? 

406
00:15:59,274 --> 00:16:00,507
I couldn't take my mouth off. 

407
00:16:00,507 --> 00:16:01,607
My gosh. 

408
00:16:01,607 --> 00:16:04,440
(He's falling because it's so tasty?) 

409
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:05,840
It's amazing. 

410
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:09,074
You can taste the juice of the corn. 

411
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:11,574
It's crispy. 

412
00:16:12,074 --> 00:16:13,440
I can't take my mouth off it. 

413
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:17,374
It's like a fruit. The skin is thin and it's crispy. 

414
00:16:17,807 --> 00:16:19,307
It's sweet. 

415
00:16:19,307 --> 00:16:21,607
Once you start eating it, you can't stop. 

416
00:16:21,974 --> 00:16:24,574
- You really like it. / - You spin it like a squirrel. 

417
00:16:24,574 --> 00:16:27,507
I don't think I'll be full after eating two of these. 

418
00:16:27,507 --> 00:16:28,940
(It's so good that one must eat at least two) 

419
00:16:29,507 --> 00:16:31,507
Where is your corn? 

420
00:16:32,174 --> 00:16:34,740
This corn is... 

421
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:38,907
It's so shocking. It's a culture shock. 

422
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:42,107
We have something that is called, 

423
00:16:42,107 --> 00:16:45,140
"sweet corn" in Korea as well. 

424
00:16:45,407 --> 00:16:49,074
But this is so delicious since it's fresh and local. 

425
00:16:49,074 --> 00:16:51,874
Shouldn't it be illegal to sell this? 

426
00:16:51,874 --> 00:16:54,240
- I want to eat more. / - He thinks it should be illegal. 

427
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,074
Let's try this one. 

428
00:16:56,207 --> 00:16:58,340
- It's time to try grilled corn. / - Grilled corn. 

429
00:16:58,340 --> 00:17:00,074
Is it better steamed or grilled? 

430
00:17:00,074 --> 00:17:01,540
It looks so good. 

431
00:17:02,007 --> 00:17:03,374
I wonder what sauce they put on. 

432
00:17:03,374 --> 00:17:05,074
It's so good by itself. 

433
00:17:05,074 --> 00:17:06,707
The thin layer of soy sauce brushed on the corn 

434
00:17:06,707 --> 00:17:08,707
makes it nice and salty. 

435
00:17:08,707 --> 00:17:10,774
(What is that?) 

436
00:17:10,774 --> 00:17:11,840
What is that? 

437
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:17,574
(What?) 

438
00:17:17,574 --> 00:17:19,674
Excuse me? Hello? 

439
00:17:19,674 --> 00:17:20,507
(She successfully stole the corn) 

440
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:22,740
How is it? 

441
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:24,807
It tastes like scorched rice. 

442
00:17:28,274 --> 00:17:30,207
Why? 

443
00:17:30,207 --> 00:17:33,474
- His eyes might pop out. / - He can't stop. 

444
00:17:33,474 --> 00:17:34,340
It's good, isn't it? 

445
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:37,040
This one tastes different from the one we just had. 

446
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:38,174
(He's enjoying the corn with his whole face) 

447
00:17:38,174 --> 00:17:40,607
- It's so good that his face is messy. / - It was so good. 

448
00:17:40,607 --> 00:17:42,407
When you eat something really good, you can't speak. 

449
00:17:42,407 --> 00:17:43,540
You're right. 

450
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:46,407
It's a shame 

451
00:17:46,407 --> 00:17:48,540
you can't experience the taste through the screen. 

452
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:52,540
The corn itself is so good. 

453
00:17:53,307 --> 00:17:55,907
When you bite it, it explodes in your mouth. 

454
00:17:55,907 --> 00:17:58,307
- Which is very refreshing. / - Exactly. 

455
00:17:58,307 --> 00:18:00,340
The burnt flavor from the sauce, 

456
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:01,874
the flavor of scorched rice. 

457
00:18:01,874 --> 00:18:04,474
The flavors from the charcoal are combined together. 

458
00:18:04,807 --> 00:18:07,540
The sweet corn and the savory sauce... 

459
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:11,607
I see why this is famous in Odori Park. 

460
00:18:11,607 --> 00:18:13,374
Since we had food, now we need to drink. 

461
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:15,207
- Something cold. / - Something cold. 

462
00:18:15,207 --> 00:18:17,540
- Beer. / - We should drink beer. 

463
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:18,707
- Something cold. / - Beer. 

464
00:18:18,707 --> 00:18:22,740
There's a beer festival in this park. 

465
00:18:25,974 --> 00:18:26,907
That sounds great. 

466
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:28,274
It's so delicious. 

467
00:18:29,207 --> 00:18:31,740
If I travel there, I'll buy corn as soon as I get there. 

468
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:37,974
(They walk to the beer festival from the corn vendor) 

469
00:18:41,274 --> 00:18:42,607
(It's the perfect weather for a walk) 

470
00:18:42,607 --> 00:18:44,074
The weather is perfect today. 

471
00:18:44,507 --> 00:18:46,274
It's the perfect weather for a walk. 

472
00:18:46,274 --> 00:18:47,440
(The weather is perfect for a summer walk) 

473
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:50,140
It was really hot yesterday. 

474
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:52,707
- I know. / - And now, I'm here... 

475
00:18:52,707 --> 00:18:55,607
Walking in a quiet park with my partner. 

476
00:18:56,107 --> 00:18:57,974
- How nice. / - It's so nice. 

477
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:01,640
Look. Can't you feel it? 

478
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,240
- Let me see. / - Can't you feel something? 

479
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:05,440
This is where the snow festival 

480
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:08,007
always takes place in winter. 

481
00:19:08,007 --> 00:19:10,774
Now there's a beer festival here. 

482
00:19:10,774 --> 00:19:13,274
It's become a beer festival now. 

483
00:19:13,274 --> 00:19:16,207
- If you take a look... / - It's beautiful. 

484
00:19:16,207 --> 00:19:19,240
Starting from here, there are beer companies... 

485
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:21,474
- On each block. / - There are different companies. 

486
00:19:21,474 --> 00:19:22,940
- Exactly. / - Yes. 

487
00:19:23,074 --> 00:19:25,640
The Sung Sikyungs are all there right now. 

488
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:28,174
I see Yangraks as well. 

489
00:19:28,174 --> 00:19:29,874
People who are like me and Yangrak. 

490
00:19:30,307 --> 00:19:33,574
(Sapporo Beer Festival, from mid-July to mid-August) 

491
00:19:33,574 --> 00:19:35,840
- We were there early... / - It's a different view. 

492
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:37,440
- Right. / - That's the middle of the day. 

493
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:40,407
- It is. / - It feels like a rock festival. 

494
00:19:41,574 --> 00:19:43,074
Hi. 

495
00:19:44,674 --> 00:19:46,974
- Beer brings peace to the world. / - It does. 

496
00:19:46,974 --> 00:19:49,474
- Beer is the best. / - It brings the people together. 

497
00:19:49,474 --> 00:19:51,674
- People are drinking a lot of beer. / - You're right. 

498
00:19:51,674 --> 00:19:53,840
What a beautiful and heartwarming scene. 

499
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:55,907
I'm suddenly wondering what I've done with my life 

500
00:19:55,907 --> 00:19:56,440
instead of going to these places. 

501
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:57,974
- Right. / - I'm getting angry. 

502
00:19:57,974 --> 00:20:00,374
We should have gone there. 

503
00:20:00,374 --> 00:20:03,440
How nice. The menu is written on the table. 

504
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:06,040
There are... 

505
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:07,440
- Many different kinds of beer. / - Before we begin... 

506
00:20:07,607 --> 00:20:09,840
As you know, this is Man Man Tour. 

507
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:10,974
- Yes. / - So... 

508
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:12,874
I've brought comic books. 

509
00:20:13,074 --> 00:20:15,107
- What? / - I've brought comic books. 

510
00:20:15,107 --> 00:20:16,274
Can't we order first? 

511
00:20:16,507 --> 00:20:19,174
Let's talk about... 

512
00:20:19,174 --> 00:20:20,774
- Why we have to drink beer. / - Can't we order first? 

513
00:20:20,774 --> 00:20:22,074
Look at her eyes. 

514
00:20:22,207 --> 00:20:24,574
There's a story about beer here. 

515
00:20:24,574 --> 00:20:25,740
- Take a look. / - Okay. 

516
00:20:25,907 --> 00:20:27,440
- Alright. / - I... 

517
00:20:27,974 --> 00:20:30,307
- Will order our menu. / - What? 

518
00:20:30,307 --> 00:20:31,974
- I don't get to choose? / - No. 

519
00:20:32,974 --> 00:20:34,107
Trust me. 

520
00:20:34,107 --> 00:20:36,507
I said I'd choose our menu, 

521
00:20:36,507 --> 00:20:38,207
so I went to order. 

522
00:20:38,207 --> 00:20:40,374
- She's doubtful though. / - She can't trust him. 

523
00:20:40,374 --> 00:20:42,940
- Make sure you order all of them. / - Trust me. 

524
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:44,340
Don't worry be happy. 

525
00:20:49,474 --> 00:20:52,174
Hyungkyu's never once 

526
00:20:52,174 --> 00:20:53,807
ordered the food. 

527
00:20:54,107 --> 00:20:55,840
I usually do it for him. 

528
00:20:56,607 --> 00:20:58,007
She has... 

529
00:20:58,007 --> 00:21:00,340
- A developed palate. / - I seek out good food. 

530
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:01,974
So I tend to trust her. 

531
00:21:01,974 --> 00:21:03,574
- I see. / - He just has to trust her. 

532
00:21:03,574 --> 00:21:05,107
If I trust her, delicious food is served. 

533
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:11,274
(All he's doing is looking) 

534
00:21:12,107 --> 00:21:13,140
But I didn't know. 

535
00:21:16,907 --> 00:21:21,274
(He even asks for a recommendation) 

536
00:21:24,374 --> 00:21:25,940
(Oh) 

537
00:21:26,274 --> 00:21:27,474
I ordered it wrong. 

538
00:21:27,474 --> 00:21:29,374
- Oh, no. / - Why? 

539
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:30,674
I ordered... 

540
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:32,207
Two glasses of beer. 

541
00:21:32,207 --> 00:21:33,274
What? 

542
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:34,974
Two glasses of this one. 

543
00:21:35,807 --> 00:21:38,074
Two glasses of this one too. 

544
00:21:39,274 --> 00:21:40,940
I got too worked up. 

545
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:42,274
He should've ordered one each. 

546
00:21:42,274 --> 00:21:43,774
What's the problem? Just drink them all. 

547
00:21:43,774 --> 00:21:45,074
- I know. / - Tell me about it. 

548
00:21:45,074 --> 00:21:46,440
Why would he be concerned? 

549
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:47,074
Just drink them up quickly. 

550
00:21:47,074 --> 00:21:48,540
- Right. / - It's not wrong. 

551
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:50,507
- Just drink more. / - He placed the right order. 

552
00:21:50,507 --> 00:21:51,974
He did a good job. 

553
00:21:51,974 --> 00:21:54,140
- He'd have to make extra orders. / - Right. 

554
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:57,340
(He's looking for the booth to pick up his order) 

555
00:22:01,674 --> 00:22:05,407
(He asks a festival staff member) 

556
00:22:06,807 --> 00:22:08,007
(Confused) 

557
00:22:08,007 --> 00:22:09,540
Extra... 

558
00:22:10,407 --> 00:22:12,307
(Isn't this the place?) 

559
00:22:12,307 --> 00:22:13,440
He looks very confused. 

560
00:22:16,407 --> 00:22:17,340
It's here. 

561
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:20,040
(He finally finds the pick-up booth) 

562
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:27,707
I ordered two glasses of this beer 

563
00:22:27,707 --> 00:22:29,640
and I was supposed to pick them up over there 

564
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:31,440
but they didn't give me any. 

565
00:22:31,874 --> 00:22:35,107
(Will they be able to drink beer within today?) 

566
00:22:35,907 --> 00:22:37,107
(Waiting for her husband and beer) 

567
00:22:37,107 --> 00:22:38,140
It's taking long. 

568
00:22:41,507 --> 00:22:42,640
There he comes. 

569
00:22:43,674 --> 00:22:45,507
Just the sight of it... 

570
00:22:45,507 --> 00:22:47,374
It's beer. 

571
00:22:48,407 --> 00:22:51,574
How much are you going to drink? This is huge. 

572
00:22:51,574 --> 00:22:53,307
I brought these first because they were heavy. 

573
00:22:53,307 --> 00:22:55,474
- Right. / - Hold on a second. 

574
00:22:55,474 --> 00:22:56,974
- You'll come back quickly? / - Yes. 

575
00:22:56,974 --> 00:22:58,140
Do you always talk politely to each other like that? 

576
00:22:58,140 --> 00:22:58,707
Yes. 

577
00:22:58,707 --> 00:23:01,040
- We sometimes talk casually too. / - See? 

578
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:03,540
They look good when they talk politely to each other. 

579
00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:05,440
By mistake... 

580
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:07,574
I ordered four glasses of beer. 

581
00:23:08,374 --> 00:23:10,707
- By mistake? / - Yes, by mistake. 

582
00:23:10,707 --> 00:23:12,740
- Or did you want to drink them all? / - Not sure. 

583
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:14,074
Drink some of this first. 

584
00:23:14,507 --> 00:23:15,374
Good. 

585
00:23:15,374 --> 00:23:16,674
- First. / - This one is... 

586
00:23:16,674 --> 00:23:18,974
- Just draft beer, right? / - Yes, it is. 

587
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:22,607
- I ordered ice beer too. / - Ice beer. 

588
00:23:22,607 --> 00:23:23,540
Did I do a good job? 

589
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:24,540
Good job. 

590
00:23:25,207 --> 00:23:26,740
Let's drink now. 

591
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:28,440
It's good. 

592
00:23:29,474 --> 00:23:31,774
(Drinking together) 

593
00:23:32,207 --> 00:23:33,040
It's so amazing. 

594
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:37,740
It has to refresh your head just like that. 

595
00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:41,074
- How refreshing. / - I know. 

596
00:23:41,474 --> 00:23:43,040
- It really was good. / - I bet. 

597
00:23:43,207 --> 00:23:44,307
(It's time to eat now) 

598
00:23:44,307 --> 00:23:46,540
- Are they bar snacks? / - Yes. 

599
00:23:46,540 --> 00:23:47,807
They look delicious. 

600
00:23:48,574 --> 00:23:51,274
- It's fried chicken. / - Is this chicken and beer? 

601
00:23:51,274 --> 00:23:52,707
Fried chicken is a must when you drink beer. 

602
00:23:52,707 --> 00:23:54,207
This one is my favorite. 

603
00:23:54,207 --> 00:23:55,574
- French fries. / - French fries. 

604
00:23:55,574 --> 00:23:56,374
French fries. 

605
00:23:56,374 --> 00:23:58,007
- Yuna looks a bit... / - French fries. 

606
00:23:58,440 --> 00:23:59,407
- Look at this. / - What do you say? 

607
00:24:00,007 --> 00:24:01,440
Half-dried squid. 

608
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,340
- She approves of the squid. / - And... 

609
00:24:03,674 --> 00:24:05,874
- Your favorite, cucumber... / - Seasoned cucumber. 

610
00:24:05,874 --> 00:24:07,174
You also like vegetables. 

611
00:24:07,174 --> 00:24:08,574
That one's delicious. 

612
00:24:08,574 --> 00:24:09,274
It is. 

613
00:24:09,274 --> 00:24:10,374
It's amazing. 

614
00:24:10,374 --> 00:24:12,107
- It is. / - It has its own unique taste. 

615
00:24:12,107 --> 00:24:14,040
- It's good. / - It's quite addictive. 

616
00:24:14,374 --> 00:24:16,440
- How exciting. / - These are... 

617
00:24:17,174 --> 00:24:19,274
- Beans. / - Beans. Good. 

618
00:24:19,274 --> 00:24:20,307
- That's basic. / - Right. 

619
00:24:20,307 --> 00:24:22,374
- Good spread. / - What do you think? 

620
00:24:22,374 --> 00:24:24,007
- What do you think? / - Actually... 

621
00:24:24,474 --> 00:24:27,140
It's my first time having you serve a beer meal for me. 

622
00:24:27,140 --> 00:24:28,707
- Right. / - Because normally... 

623
00:24:28,707 --> 00:24:30,407
- I order food. / - Right. 

624
00:24:30,407 --> 00:24:31,907
You're not so satisfied with the snacks, are you? 

625
00:24:32,574 --> 00:24:34,840
I prefer non-fried ones 

626
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:36,074
to the fried ones. 

627
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:38,474
Most of them were my preferences. 

628
00:24:38,474 --> 00:24:41,674
I'll give you a score this way. 

629
00:24:41,674 --> 00:24:43,174
There are six kinds of dishes. 

630
00:24:43,174 --> 00:24:45,007
Out of six... 

631
00:24:45,007 --> 00:24:45,740
Out of six. 

632
00:24:46,474 --> 00:24:47,974
Out of six... 

633
00:24:47,974 --> 00:24:49,107
(Nervous) 

634
00:24:54,007 --> 00:24:55,440
(What's the score of Hyungkyu's first beer course?) 

635
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:57,074
Out of six... 

636
00:24:57,774 --> 00:24:59,340
I'll give you 5.5. 

637
00:24:59,774 --> 00:25:00,674
5.5! 

638
00:25:00,674 --> 00:25:02,440
- That's a high score. / - Good. 

639
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:03,274
You gave him a high score. 

640
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:04,974
- In that sense... / - If this... 

641
00:25:04,974 --> 00:25:06,440
Had been sausages... 

642
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:08,174
- Oh, right. / - Sausages. 

643
00:25:08,174 --> 00:25:11,340
- I'd have given you 10 out of 6. / - Sausages. 

644
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:12,840
I missed the sausages. 

645
00:25:13,474 --> 00:25:14,574
Cheers. 

646
00:25:15,907 --> 00:25:16,740
Cheers. 

647
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:18,707
(The considerate they are, the better the mood gets) 

648
00:25:19,674 --> 00:25:22,107
(Her husband's favorite) 

649
00:25:24,174 --> 00:25:25,307
It's delicious. 

650
00:25:29,707 --> 00:25:31,874
(She takes a bite of her favorite too) 

651
00:25:32,507 --> 00:25:35,607
I usually like vegetable bar snacks 

652
00:25:35,607 --> 00:25:36,974
but this seasoned cucumber is truly amazing. 

653
00:25:37,540 --> 00:25:40,674
It tastes savory like sesame oil and a bit salty too. 

654
00:25:41,374 --> 00:25:43,474
- It goes well with beer. / - I know, right? 

655
00:25:44,007 --> 00:25:46,440
- I highly recommend it. / - I love that dish. 

656
00:25:47,140 --> 00:25:49,240
- The cucumber is good. / - It's really good. 

657
00:25:49,774 --> 00:25:51,374
By the way, 

658
00:25:51,374 --> 00:25:52,174
aren't you reminded of someone? 

659
00:25:53,107 --> 00:25:54,974
- Our son. / - I'm reminded of... 

660
00:25:54,974 --> 00:25:56,440
Our son so much. 

661
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:57,607
I'm reminded of Minjae. 

662
00:25:57,607 --> 00:25:59,440
- That's right. / - Of course... 

663
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:03,274
- He must be doing fine. / - I know. 

664
00:26:03,274 --> 00:26:05,974
But it's our first time drinking beer together 

665
00:26:05,974 --> 00:26:07,374
in the daytime... 

666
00:26:07,374 --> 00:26:11,474
- Ever since our son was born. / - Especially on a trip. 

667
00:26:11,474 --> 00:26:12,440
Totally. 

668
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:14,007
I'm envious of that. 

669
00:26:14,507 --> 00:26:16,374
Whether they have a child or not, 

670
00:26:16,374 --> 00:26:20,240
everyone is busy taking care of their lives. 

671
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:21,174
But we have... 

672
00:26:21,574 --> 00:26:26,007
Created an unusual space within our daily lives 

673
00:26:26,007 --> 00:26:27,607
to do unusual things. 

674
00:26:27,607 --> 00:26:29,407
- It's... / - That's why traveling is good. 

675
00:26:29,407 --> 00:26:31,374
I know. That's what's good about going on a trip. 

676
00:26:32,107 --> 00:26:34,340
- I love it. / - Me too. 

677
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:36,274
What do we do now? 

678
00:26:36,274 --> 00:26:37,607
(What's the next schedule of the Man Man Tour?) 

679
00:26:37,607 --> 00:26:39,607
- Mr. Planner. / - Yes. 

680
00:26:40,207 --> 00:26:41,674
I've searched on the books... 

681
00:26:42,607 --> 00:26:44,240
And this city is famous... 

682
00:26:44,974 --> 00:26:46,974
For its sparkling night view. 

683
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:50,507
- It has a wonderful night view. / - Observatory? 

684
00:26:50,507 --> 00:26:53,274
There's an observatory on the 531m-high mountain 

685
00:26:53,274 --> 00:26:56,840
which is located in the southwest side of Sapporo. 

686
00:26:57,107 --> 00:26:58,674
- Do we have to climb the mountain? / - No. 

687
00:26:58,674 --> 00:27:01,307
Let's head to the observatory. 

688
00:27:01,307 --> 00:27:03,107
Good. 

689
00:27:03,107 --> 00:27:04,040
(She loves it) 

690
00:27:04,407 --> 00:27:05,907
- Let's finish the rest. / - Let's drink. 

691
00:27:06,207 --> 00:27:07,107
Let's do that. 

692
00:27:08,540 --> 00:27:09,574
Cheers. 

693
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:12,507
Here's another interesting thing about the beer festival. 

694
00:27:12,507 --> 00:27:15,007
You get to have certain kinds of beer only sold there. 

695
00:27:15,574 --> 00:27:18,440
- It's limited. / - It's really fun... 

696
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:19,974
- To try that limited beer. / - How refreshing. 

697
00:27:19,974 --> 00:27:21,040
It's so nice. 

698
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:28,140
(Man Man Tour, night view) 

699
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:31,107
(They travel about 20 minutes from the park) 

700
00:27:31,107 --> 00:27:32,407
We rode a shuttle bus... 

701
00:27:32,807 --> 00:27:36,740
And headed to the observatory. 

702
00:27:38,374 --> 00:27:40,007
- Alright. / - Gosh. 

703
00:27:40,874 --> 00:27:43,307
We've arrived here on the shuttle bus. 

704
00:27:43,807 --> 00:27:45,507
The air feels different here. 

705
00:27:45,507 --> 00:27:47,840
- It's refreshing. / - It really is. 

706
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:50,540
It has the coolness 

707
00:27:50,540 --> 00:27:52,174
which you can feel in forests, don't you think? 

708
00:27:52,174 --> 00:27:53,340
This place is called, 

709
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:54,907
Mt. Moiwa observatory. 

710
00:27:54,907 --> 00:27:56,440
Moiwa. 

711
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:59,007
- Let's go. / - We've eaten a lot today... 

712
00:27:59,474 --> 00:28:00,607
So let's have a romantic time. 

713
00:28:01,574 --> 00:28:05,507
It's one of the three new best night views in Japan. 

714
00:28:05,507 --> 00:28:06,807
- Where did you hear that? / - I memorized it. 

715
00:28:06,807 --> 00:28:08,040
I picked it up from others. 

716
00:28:09,007 --> 00:28:10,640
- Let's go. / - Don't ask me for details. 

717
00:28:10,774 --> 00:28:11,807
Let's go in. 

718
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:16,107
One of the three new best night views in Japan? 

719
00:28:22,774 --> 00:28:26,240
(And) 

720
00:28:33,907 --> 00:28:36,374
They do a vote on night views once every 3 years. 

721
00:28:36,907 --> 00:28:38,707
It was Hakodate instead of Sapporo 

722
00:28:38,707 --> 00:28:40,940
until the last survey. 

723
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:44,640
But the night view of Sapporo placed 2nd 

724
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:46,574
at the survey taken in 2015. 

725
00:28:46,574 --> 00:28:48,474
That's how it became the new best night view. 

726
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:51,274
The survey is taken once... 

727
00:28:51,274 --> 00:28:52,940
- Every 3 years. / - Right. 

728
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:54,474
Let's ride a cable car 

729
00:28:54,474 --> 00:28:55,707
and head to the top. 

730
00:28:55,707 --> 00:28:56,274
Okay. 

731
00:28:56,274 --> 00:28:58,240
- We must buy tickets for it. / - Tickets. 

732
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:01,640
Usually, you have to pay $17 for an adult ticket. 

733
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:02,874
But there are discount promotions. 

734
00:29:02,874 --> 00:29:06,307
You can find discount promotions via the app. 

735
00:29:06,307 --> 00:29:09,940
- Here's the discount for the cable car. / - Top three. 

736
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:12,940
You can save 340 yen with this coupon. 

737
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:15,474
- You should prepare it beforehand. / - Exactly. 

738
00:29:15,474 --> 00:29:17,340
It has different destinations. 

739
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:19,140
- One goes to the mountain top. / - I know. 

740
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:20,307
The other stops in the middle. 

741
00:29:20,607 --> 00:29:22,507
The price varies depending on the destination. 

742
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:26,574
(Roundtrip ticket, $13.90 per person) 

743
00:29:26,574 --> 00:29:27,607
Thank you. 

744
00:29:28,607 --> 00:29:29,507
Nice. 

745
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:31,974
It's so nice and wide. 

746
00:29:31,974 --> 00:29:33,040
It's here. 

747
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:35,074
It's so roomy inside. 

748
00:29:35,074 --> 00:29:36,574
It's nice. Let's... 

749
00:29:36,574 --> 00:29:38,174
- How exciting. / - It's here. 

750
00:29:38,174 --> 00:29:39,640
(The back side has a better view) 

751
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:41,174
If you go up... 

752
00:29:42,074 --> 00:29:44,840
It feels like you're going to a dreamland. 

753
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:48,240
(Such a view lies ahead of you) 

754
00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:51,740
You know that feeling when 

755
00:29:51,740 --> 00:29:52,874
you're relieved of indigestion? 

756
00:29:52,874 --> 00:29:55,007
This makes me feel that kind of relief. 

757
00:29:55,007 --> 00:29:55,940
It's nice and refreshing. 

758
00:29:57,974 --> 00:30:02,107
(Living the moment and the view in pictures) 

759
00:30:02,674 --> 00:30:03,674
The cable car was taken in the photo. 

760
00:30:03,674 --> 00:30:04,874
The cable car. 

761
00:30:04,874 --> 00:30:06,707
(Man Man Tour in Hokkaido) 

762
00:30:06,707 --> 00:30:07,740
(Current location) 

763
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:09,940
We've gotten off from the first one. 

764
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:12,207
We have to wait here a bit... 

765
00:30:12,574 --> 00:30:14,574
And get on a mini cable car. 

766
00:30:14,574 --> 00:30:16,474
- You're transferring. / - You have to take... 

767
00:30:16,474 --> 00:30:17,540
- 2 cable cars. / - You take 2 cable cars. 

768
00:30:17,540 --> 00:30:19,440
It's so high up. 

769
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:20,574
It must be pretty high. 

770
00:30:21,474 --> 00:30:23,174
I've never been to such a place before. 

771
00:30:23,174 --> 00:30:24,040
Me neither. 

772
00:30:24,140 --> 00:30:25,407
You've planned well. 

773
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:27,674
Good job. 

774
00:30:29,807 --> 00:30:31,540
(They're fascinated by the scenery) 

775
00:30:31,540 --> 00:30:32,707
Look. 

776
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:35,274
We're here. We're here. 

777
00:30:39,974 --> 00:30:42,040
(They're finally on the top of Mt. Moiwa) 

778
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:43,874
It smells different here. 

779
00:30:43,874 --> 00:30:46,874
- It smells refreshing. / - I love this smell. 

780
00:30:47,774 --> 00:30:48,874
It's cool. 

781
00:30:49,174 --> 00:30:51,174
It's quite chilly up here. 

782
00:30:51,174 --> 00:30:52,640
(As the sun is about to go down, it's quite chilly) 

783
00:30:54,007 --> 00:30:55,607
It's really nice here. 

784
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:57,207
Look at that. 

785
00:30:57,207 --> 00:30:59,607
(Fascinated) 

786
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:01,940
There aren't as many people there as I thought. 

787
00:31:01,940 --> 00:31:04,774
We went there deliberately early. 

788
00:31:04,774 --> 00:31:07,107
- In the evening... / - It must be crowded then. 

789
00:31:07,107 --> 00:31:09,174
- Locals queue to go up. / - That's how it looks. 

790
00:31:09,974 --> 00:31:11,307
Look at that. 

791
00:31:11,307 --> 00:31:12,407
(Fascinated) 

792
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:15,674
It looks so surreal. 

793
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:18,140
Look over there. 

794
00:31:20,607 --> 00:31:23,040
It looks really amazing. 

795
00:31:29,174 --> 00:31:33,340
(The clouds slowly sail in the sky) 

796
00:31:33,340 --> 00:31:38,440
(The ridge touches the sky) 

797
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:41,140
It's pretty nice in the daytime as well. 

798
00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:43,107
It has a clear and nice... 

799
00:31:43,874 --> 00:31:45,507
Panoramic view. 

800
00:31:45,507 --> 00:31:47,007
It's amazing. 

801
00:31:48,274 --> 00:31:54,774
(When the sun sets, Sapporo's night gets bright) 

802
00:31:54,774 --> 00:31:57,540
- We went there one hour ahead. / - It's so beautiful. 

803
00:31:57,540 --> 00:31:58,874
It looks so pretty. 

804
00:31:58,874 --> 00:32:00,474
It looks so romantic. 

805
00:32:00,474 --> 00:32:02,640
- It's romantic. / - What a great night view. 

806
00:32:05,907 --> 00:32:11,207
(The stars of Sapporo light up the entire city) 

807
00:32:18,140 --> 00:32:19,407
It's stunning. 

808
00:32:20,174 --> 00:32:22,774
We've seen the night views of different places. 

809
00:32:22,774 --> 00:32:24,640
- Since you like going to observatories. / - I do. 

810
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:26,274
We always visit observatories, right? 

811
00:32:26,274 --> 00:32:28,707
Certain towers of different cities. 

812
00:32:28,707 --> 00:32:31,374
The one in Fukuoka is the most recent one we visited. 

813
00:32:31,374 --> 00:32:33,907
This place is much better. 

814
00:32:34,107 --> 00:32:37,374
We've also been up to the observatory of Sapporo. 

815
00:32:37,374 --> 00:32:39,540
- You're right. / - It was beautiful there too. 

816
00:32:40,674 --> 00:32:42,274
I totally get why this is 

817
00:32:42,274 --> 00:32:44,474
one of the three best new night views of Japan. 

818
00:32:44,474 --> 00:32:47,074
- It's wonderful. / - It's so colorful... 

819
00:32:47,074 --> 00:32:50,674
- And vivid. You see many colors. / - You're right. 

820
00:32:50,674 --> 00:32:52,974
It looks like twinkling stars. 

821
00:32:54,007 --> 00:32:56,574
- It's so shiny. / - This is amazing. 

822
00:32:56,907 --> 00:32:58,240
It's so sparkling. 

823
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:03,107
The city lights shine like the stars in the night sky. 

824
00:33:03,107 --> 00:33:04,507
They're so shiny. 

825
00:33:04,707 --> 00:33:08,374
I love you more than all the lights. 

826
00:33:08,374 --> 00:33:09,574
You know I do, right? 

827
00:33:09,574 --> 00:33:12,340
(I love you more than all the lights) 

828
00:33:12,340 --> 00:33:13,340
Let's make a heart. 

829
00:33:15,807 --> 00:33:18,840
We should let others see it too. 

830
00:33:19,207 --> 00:33:20,774
Let's move on to our next spot. 

831
00:33:21,340 --> 00:33:23,640
It's so beautiful. It must be way prettier... 

832
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:26,540
- In reality than on the screen. / - It was very beautiful. 

833
00:33:26,540 --> 00:33:29,474
(Man Man Tour, robatayaki) 

834
00:33:29,474 --> 00:33:31,040
They're our team 

835
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:33,307
but it's all about eating and drinking. 

836
00:33:33,307 --> 00:33:35,007
- That's correct. / - Maybe you should've... 

837
00:33:35,007 --> 00:33:36,874
Taken Yangrak with you. 

838
00:33:36,874 --> 00:33:39,040
My mouth is watering so much now. 

839
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:40,040
(His mouth is filled with saliva) 

840
00:33:41,140 --> 00:33:43,340
I wonder where they went among 

841
00:33:43,340 --> 00:33:44,207
so many good restaurants. 

842
00:33:44,207 --> 00:33:46,207
There must be a lot of good restaurants there. 

843
00:33:47,507 --> 00:33:49,474
(This is where their last schedule takes place) 

844
00:33:49,474 --> 00:33:51,240
It's so crowded here. 

845
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:52,674
- We're back to reality. / - We're back to reality. 

846
00:33:52,674 --> 00:33:55,707
We're back down to reality. Ta-da. 

847
00:33:55,707 --> 00:33:56,874
(They're back in reality from the dreamy observatory) 

848
00:33:57,274 --> 00:34:01,307
I think people would come here to go to bars. 

849
00:34:01,674 --> 00:34:04,140
We're here alone without Minjae. 

850
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:05,274
So... 

851
00:34:05,907 --> 00:34:07,640
- Where we can drink alcohol. / - Where we can drink. 

852
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:11,540
Alright. Actually, the beer here is very delicious. 

853
00:34:11,540 --> 00:34:14,040
Does the place we're going now have good beer? 

854
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:16,474
- It has seafood. / - We can't miss seafood here. 

855
00:34:16,474 --> 00:34:17,374
And crabs. 

856
00:34:18,140 --> 00:34:19,140
Crabs? 

857
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:20,707
- Let's go eat crabs. / - Crabs? 

858
00:34:20,707 --> 00:34:22,807
- Is it this way? / - It's this way. 

859
00:34:22,807 --> 00:34:23,874
Let's go. 

860
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:30,307
I searched the restaurants that the locals like. 

861
00:34:30,940 --> 00:34:33,007

- It looks delicious. / - I'm worried this restaurant might... 

863
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:37,640
Get too famous after it's aired. 

864
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:38,740
It will be. 

865
00:34:41,274 --> 00:34:43,174
This restaurant looks fancy. 

866
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:45,307
This is the fantasy of every mom and dad. 

867
00:34:45,507 --> 00:34:46,807
The fantasy of every mom and dad. 

868
00:34:47,407 --> 00:34:50,140
Having the children go to bed and drinking alone. 

869
00:34:50,140 --> 00:34:52,340
Drinking alone abroad. 

870
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:55,207
- And with a lot of great dishes. / - I know. 

871
00:34:55,207 --> 00:34:57,640

- It does. / - Look at that. 

873
00:34:59,574 --> 00:35:01,407
It looks so delicious. 

874
00:35:01,974 --> 00:35:03,174
It looks delicious. 

875
00:35:03,707 --> 00:35:04,940
I'm nervous. 

876
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:06,907
You're nervous to see how delicious it will be, right? 

877
00:35:06,907 --> 00:35:07,907
Yes, I am. 

878
00:35:08,207 --> 00:35:09,840
Here it is. We've been waiting. 

879
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:14,040
(Cold beer is served first) 

880
00:35:14,474 --> 00:35:16,974
It looks beautiful. 

881
00:35:16,974 --> 00:35:18,707
I'd like to take a picture. 

882
00:35:18,707 --> 00:35:20,307
Are you going to take pictures before we drink? 

883
00:35:20,707 --> 00:35:21,907
Can I take one picture? 

884
00:35:21,907 --> 00:35:23,207
You have a disagreement on this. 

885
00:35:23,207 --> 00:35:24,174
One wants to take pictures 

886
00:35:24,174 --> 00:35:26,507
while the other wants to drink first. 

887
00:35:26,507 --> 00:35:28,840
Let's clink the glasses and let me drink first. 

888
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:30,774
I changed my mind. I have to drink too. 

889
00:35:30,774 --> 00:35:33,640
(Beer tastes the best right after it's served) 

890
00:35:35,474 --> 00:35:36,674
It's very creamy. 

891
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:41,474
- It was a good idea to come here. / - It was. 

892
00:35:41,474 --> 00:35:44,174
How was it compared to the beer from the festival? 

893
00:35:44,174 --> 00:35:45,107
It was a little different. 

894
00:35:45,107 --> 00:35:47,440
Could you not drool when you speak? 

895
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:49,440
- It was amazing. / - Really? 

896
00:35:50,474 --> 00:35:53,507
Stop rooting for their team. 

897
00:35:55,574 --> 00:35:57,507
The first dish must be sashimi. 

898
00:35:58,407 --> 00:36:00,340
- It's squid sashimi. / - Squid sashimi. 

899
00:36:00,340 --> 00:36:01,440
Squid. 

900
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:03,607
- It's squid sashimi and innards. / - It's squid sashimi. 

901
00:36:03,907 --> 00:36:05,407
This must be squid innards. 

902
00:36:05,507 --> 00:36:07,340
- You can eat that? / - When we were there... 

903
00:36:07,340 --> 00:36:09,574
Squid was in season. 

904
00:36:10,107 --> 00:36:12,140
And this is grilled crab innards. 

905
00:36:12,140 --> 00:36:13,607
- The price... / - It was beautiful. 

906
00:36:13,607 --> 00:36:15,407
It was about $7. 

907
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:16,807
It was 720 yen. 

908
00:36:16,874 --> 00:36:19,374
It has crab meat on top. 

909
00:36:19,674 --> 00:36:22,407
- It has a rich crab flavor. / - How do you like it? 

910
00:36:23,274 --> 00:36:25,240
It's savory and rich. 

911
00:36:25,407 --> 00:36:27,040
It has the taste of the deep ocean. 

912
00:36:27,107 --> 00:36:30,274
- I love crab innards. / - I love it too. 

913
00:36:30,274 --> 00:36:32,440
- It's served with crab meat. / - That costs just $7.40? 

914
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:33,507
It looks delicious, doesn't it? 

915
00:36:33,507 --> 00:36:35,540
- It's a little... / - Look at this. 

916
00:36:35,540 --> 00:36:37,707
- I know. / - It looks so delicious. 

917
00:36:37,707 --> 00:36:39,474
- It does, doesn't it? / - Let's warm it a bit... 

918
00:36:39,474 --> 00:36:41,140
And before it's too late.. 

919
00:36:41,140 --> 00:36:43,174
- Shall we turn off the stove? / - Let's turn it off. 

920
00:36:45,407 --> 00:36:46,874
It looks wonderful. 

921
00:36:47,707 --> 00:36:49,107
It smells so good. 

922
00:36:49,107 --> 00:36:50,340
She looks so happy. 

923
00:36:50,507 --> 00:36:53,574
- It has to be delicious. / - I know. 

924
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:55,040
How is it? 

925
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:56,207
(He doesn't like innards) 

926
00:36:56,207 --> 00:36:57,507
It tastes delicious! 

927
00:36:58,307 --> 00:36:59,374
Does it taste delicious? 

928
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:01,540
It's good. 

929
00:37:01,540 --> 00:37:03,340
(He plucks up the courage and tries it) 

930
00:37:03,340 --> 00:37:05,107
Now is the time to drink beer. 

931
00:37:05,107 --> 00:37:06,674
(So this is how it tastes) 

932
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:11,107
(This is what I wanted) 

933
00:37:12,207 --> 00:37:13,274
Squid sashimi. 

934
00:37:13,274 --> 00:37:15,374
Squid was in season then. 

935
00:37:15,374 --> 00:37:17,074
- It was sweet. / - Look at the cuts on it. 

936
00:37:17,074 --> 00:37:18,540
- It's really chewy, right? / - It is. 

937
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:20,107
- Look at that. / - I can see... 

938
00:37:20,107 --> 00:37:21,407
The delicate touch of the chef. 

939
00:37:21,907 --> 00:37:24,307
This is mountain wasabi. 

940
00:37:24,307 --> 00:37:26,374
- It's white. / - Yes, it's white. 

941
00:37:26,374 --> 00:37:28,140
- It's a different kind of wasabi. / - I see. 

942
00:37:28,140 --> 00:37:30,774
- That wasabi was delicious too. / - How is it? 

943
00:37:30,774 --> 00:37:32,107
(She tastes it with a little bit of wasabi) 

944
00:37:32,107 --> 00:37:33,274
Are you thinking? 

945
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:36,274
- How many points would you give? / - It's sweet. 

946
00:37:36,874 --> 00:37:39,174
It's the best squid sashimi I've ever tried. 

947
00:37:39,174 --> 00:37:40,274
Is it that good? 

948
00:37:40,274 --> 00:37:43,107
- Was it the best one you've tried? / - It was so good. 

949
00:37:43,107 --> 00:37:45,107
What's important hasn't... 

950
00:37:45,107 --> 00:37:46,940
- Come yet. / - It must be the innards. 

951
00:37:47,407 --> 00:37:49,140
- It's sweet. / - It is, isn't it? 

952
00:37:50,140 --> 00:37:51,340
Let me try the innards. 

953
00:37:51,340 --> 00:37:53,607
The innards are slightly frozen. 

954
00:37:53,607 --> 00:37:54,907
I'm a little scared to try the innards. 

955
00:37:55,207 --> 00:37:57,074
Let me put a little more wasabi on it. 

956
00:37:57,074 --> 00:37:58,140
The innards are the best. 

957
00:37:58,140 --> 00:38:00,240
I've never tried that. 

958
00:38:01,274 --> 00:38:02,274
(Surprised) 

959
00:38:02,274 --> 00:38:04,740
Her face tells how good it is. 

960
00:38:06,307 --> 00:38:07,474
- Suddenly... / - It tastes great. 

961

The squid innards is amazing. 

964

- Is it good? / - It's the king. 

965
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:18,107
- King of kings? / - King of kings. 

966
00:38:18,707 --> 00:38:21,674
- This was served frozen. / - You're right. 

967
00:38:21,974 --> 00:38:23,474
It's tasty when it's thawed. 

968
00:38:23,474 --> 00:38:25,807
When it's thawed, it's creamy. 

969
00:38:25,807 --> 00:38:27,140
It's creamy. 

970
00:38:27,140 --> 00:38:30,607
- It's like the foie gras of the ocean. / - It is. 

971
00:38:30,607 --> 00:38:31,907
That's a great way to put it. 

972
00:38:32,374 --> 00:38:35,074
It's not fishy. It has a very rich flavor. 

973
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:38,807
How is it? 

974
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:41,774
You're dancing suddenly. 

975
00:38:41,774 --> 00:38:43,040
It's so good. 

976
00:38:43,607 --> 00:38:45,340
- This is so good. / - So it's tasty. 

977
00:38:45,340 --> 00:38:46,740
It was very tasty. 

978
00:38:46,740 --> 00:38:48,874
(Steak and grilled onions are served) 

979
00:38:48,874 --> 00:38:50,174
Onions. 

980
00:38:50,540 --> 00:38:52,007
I want to try that. 

981
00:38:52,007 --> 00:38:53,707
- It looks good. / - It's beautiful. 

982
00:38:55,674 --> 00:38:57,537
(Battle Trip Part 2 will be aired soon) 

983
00:38:57,537 --> 00:38:58,757

(Steak and grilled onions are served) 

986
00:39:01,691 --> 00:39:03,191
Onions. 

987
00:39:03,191 --> 00:39:05,457
- Onions are just onions though. / - Look at the butter. 

988
00:39:05,457 --> 00:39:09,091
- That onion was... / - Onions taste all the same. 

989
00:39:09,091 --> 00:39:11,124
- Awesome. / - It looks beautiful. 

990
00:39:11,124 --> 00:39:12,991
(Grilled onion, $5.40) 

991
00:39:12,991 --> 00:39:13,924
What should I start with? 

992
00:39:13,924 --> 00:39:15,524
(Steak, $20.30) 

993
00:39:15,524 --> 00:39:17,757
- That looks delicious. / - It looks good, doesn't it? 

994
00:39:17,757 --> 00:39:20,257
- That looks so good. / - This is why you get fat there. 

995
00:39:21,591 --> 00:39:22,424
That meat... 

996
00:39:22,424 --> 00:39:25,257
- You can't help it. / - Was very tender. 

997
00:39:25,257 --> 00:39:26,691
That butter... 

998
00:39:26,691 --> 00:39:28,724
- You love meat. / - I do. 

999
00:39:31,491 --> 00:39:33,857
It's tender and juicy. 

1000
00:39:35,291 --> 00:39:35,924
It's so juicy. 

1001
00:39:35,924 --> 00:39:38,357
- People with bad teeth... / - I want meat now. 

1002
00:39:39,691 --> 00:39:41,157
It's good for old people who don't have good teeth. 

1003
00:39:41,724 --> 00:39:44,657
You can even cut it with your teeth. It's well cooked. 

1004
00:39:45,124 --> 00:39:47,224
This steak is... 

1005
00:39:48,091 --> 00:39:50,424
One of the best three steak dishes I've ever had. 

1006
00:39:50,424 --> 00:39:52,624
- Really? / - Yes, it's that good. 

1007
00:39:53,524 --> 00:39:55,924
I could lose myself when I eat this. 

1008
00:39:57,157 --> 00:39:58,591
It's delicious. 

1009
00:39:58,624 --> 00:40:00,357
I'm curious about this onion. 

1010
00:40:00,357 --> 00:40:01,757
- The onion. / - I wonder if... 

1011
00:40:01,757 --> 00:40:03,791
- The onion tastes good. / - You got shocked, right? 

1012
00:40:03,791 --> 00:40:05,424
- Why? / - You'll see. 

1013
00:40:06,191 --> 00:40:07,924
- That tastes good? / - That's the onion. 

1014
00:40:07,924 --> 00:40:10,791
The butter on the onion melted. Look. 

1015
00:40:10,791 --> 00:40:12,957
- It did. / - Where did it go? 

1016
00:40:13,324 --> 00:40:15,791
It's inside the onion. 

1017
00:40:15,791 --> 00:40:18,991
I have a feeling that this onion will be so tasty. 

1018
00:40:26,391 --> 00:40:27,591
This is not an onion. 

1019
00:40:27,591 --> 00:40:29,457
- It's not an onion? / - It's not, right? 

1020
00:40:29,857 --> 00:40:30,957
What is this? 

1021
00:40:30,957 --> 00:40:32,057
Does it not taste like what we imagine? 

1022
00:40:32,057 --> 00:40:33,391
- No, it doesn't. / - No. 

1023
00:40:33,957 --> 00:40:36,091
It's like I see an onion in a forest... 

1024
00:40:36,657 --> 00:40:38,424
And it's harvesting itself. 

1025
00:40:40,024 --> 00:40:41,557
Saying I should eat it. 

1026
00:40:43,757 --> 00:40:44,924
"Eat me!" 

1027
00:40:45,057 --> 00:40:46,491
- "Please eat me." / - The two of them... 

1028
00:40:46,491 --> 00:40:48,157
Have the same sense of humor. 

1029
00:40:48,157 --> 00:40:49,391
She must like his jokes. 

1030
00:40:49,391 --> 00:40:51,391
I guess it's not funny to others. 

1031
00:40:51,391 --> 00:40:53,857
- What made you laugh so hard? / - I don't get it. 

1032
00:40:54,257 --> 00:40:55,391
Was the onion joke so funny? 

1033
00:40:55,391 --> 00:40:57,757
It was so delicious. You'll feel the same. 

1034
00:40:57,757 --> 00:40:59,457
You're so meant to be. 

1035
00:40:59,457 --> 00:41:02,424
- I don't like vegetables. / - You don't. You hate them. 

1036
00:41:02,424 --> 00:41:06,791
This onion is the best onion I've ever eaten in my life. 

1037
00:41:06,791 --> 00:41:08,357
(It's the best onion he has ever eaten in his life) 

1038
00:41:08,924 --> 00:41:12,557
- What's so funny? / - It's still funny for me. 

1039
00:41:12,557 --> 00:41:15,891
- We'd like to laugh too. / - You guys are weird. 

1040
00:41:15,891 --> 00:41:17,091
Tomorrow... 

1041
00:41:17,891 --> 00:41:19,357
We're going to meet them. 

1042
00:41:21,024 --> 00:41:23,791
- Is it far away? / - We'll rent a car. 

1043
00:41:25,157 --> 00:41:28,357
- A rental sounds good. / - We'll rent a car... 

1044
00:41:28,357 --> 00:41:29,924
And truly experience Mother Nature. 

1045
00:41:29,924 --> 00:41:32,191
- That's our plan. / - I'll be looking forward to it. 

1046
00:41:32,191 --> 00:41:35,924
- Cheers. / - Cheers. 

1047
00:41:35,924 --> 00:41:37,657
- Man Man Tour. / - It was such a fun day today. 

1048
00:41:37,657 --> 00:41:38,391
Let's do this. 

1049
00:41:38,391 --> 00:41:40,057
It looks so delicious. They are delicious. 

1050
00:41:41,491 --> 00:41:42,857
If we mostly ate yesterday, 

1051
00:41:42,857 --> 00:41:44,724
today is about experiencing Mother Nature. 

1052
00:41:44,724 --> 00:41:46,224
It'll be even cooler. 

1053
00:41:46,224 --> 00:41:47,524
I can't wait. 

1054
00:41:47,524 --> 00:41:48,891
This is the farm. 

1055
00:41:48,891 --> 00:41:50,524
So pretty. 

1056
00:41:50,524 --> 00:41:51,991
(Fresh air, beautiful views) 

1057
00:41:51,991 --> 00:41:53,624
- Wow. / - What is that? 

1058
00:41:53,624 --> 00:41:57,924
(With the soulmate) 

1059
00:41:58,757 --> 00:42:00,224
The rain... 

1060
00:42:00,224 --> 00:42:01,657
It's nice when it rains. 

1061
00:42:01,657 --> 00:42:03,557
It's nice when it doesn't too. 

1062
00:42:03,557 --> 00:42:04,824
But with this wonderful rain... 

1063
00:42:04,824 --> 00:42:06,657
I love it that it's raining today. 

1064
00:42:07,724 --> 00:42:09,224
I liked the trip plan. 

1065
00:42:09,224 --> 00:42:11,357
And I like my trip partner as well. 

1066
00:42:11,357 --> 00:42:12,691
Plus the weather was great. 

1067
00:42:12,691 --> 00:42:14,291
Everything was great. 

1068
00:42:14,291 --> 00:42:16,391
I want to come back on a clear day. 

1069
00:42:16,391 --> 00:42:18,191
(Their perfect trip continues) 

1070
00:42:19,024 --> 00:42:22,391
(Day 2 in Hokkaido begins early) 

1071
00:42:22,391 --> 00:42:23,591
This is the second day, right? 

1072
00:42:23,591 --> 00:42:26,624
- Yes, it is. / - We rented a car. 

1073
00:42:26,624 --> 00:42:27,724
(Near Sapporo Station, 8 a.m.) 

1074
00:42:28,924 --> 00:42:30,624
It's a great morning. 

1075
00:42:30,624 --> 00:42:32,424
- I'm sleepy. / - But I'm a little sleepy. 

1076
00:42:32,424 --> 00:42:35,624
Yesterday, it wasn't a Man Man Tour... 

1077
00:42:35,924 --> 00:42:38,857
- Food Food Tour. / - It was a Food Food Tour. 

1078
00:42:39,324 --> 00:42:41,657
It was all about eating yesterday. 

1079
00:42:41,657 --> 00:42:43,791
Today, we're going to nature. 

1080
00:42:43,791 --> 00:42:45,924
- Nature? / - We'll freshen our eyes. 

1081
00:42:46,657 --> 00:42:48,157
In order to do that, 

1082
00:42:48,157 --> 00:42:50,291
we can't walk. 

1083
00:42:50,291 --> 00:42:52,857
That's why we will rent a car. 

1084
00:42:52,857 --> 00:42:55,057
It'll be confusing driving on the opposite side. 

1085
00:42:55,057 --> 00:42:58,157
- You can easily get used to it. / - It's confusing... 

1086
00:42:58,157 --> 00:42:59,991
In the beginning but you get used to it soon. 

1087
00:43:00,491 --> 00:43:03,657
- So this is... / - This is a beginner sign in Japan. 

1088
00:43:03,657 --> 00:43:05,524
It's magnetic and you can attach it here. 

1089
00:43:06,124 --> 00:43:07,791
- Beginner! / - Good. 

1090
00:43:07,791 --> 00:43:10,224
- Right. They have that in Japan. / - Yes, they do. 

1091
00:43:10,224 --> 00:43:13,224
This is for beginners and there's a sign for seniors. 

1092
00:43:13,224 --> 00:43:15,991
- There's a senior sign. / - A senior sign. 

1093
00:43:15,991 --> 00:43:17,257
It's okay to get lost... 

1094
00:43:17,257 --> 00:43:19,491
- When you have that sign. / - That's right. 

1095
00:43:19,724 --> 00:43:21,891
At first, I was surprised 

1096
00:43:21,891 --> 00:43:22,924
to see different signs on the cars. 

1097
00:43:22,924 --> 00:43:26,791
One of the things you've wanted to do here is 

1098
00:43:26,791 --> 00:43:29,691
to go to a farm in Hokkaido. 

1099
00:43:29,691 --> 00:43:34,757
You can see and feed 

1100
00:43:34,757 --> 00:43:36,124
the animal in nature. 

1101
00:43:36,691 --> 00:43:37,991
You can milk the cow yourself too. 

1102
00:43:39,024 --> 00:43:42,057
There's a cheese workshop you can participate in... 

1103
00:43:43,124 --> 00:43:44,891
With the milk you got. 

1104
00:43:44,891 --> 00:43:46,791
It sounds like there are many activities to do. 

1105
00:43:48,657 --> 00:43:50,091
It looks nice. 

1106
00:43:50,091 --> 00:43:53,591
First, we went to a farm. 

1107
00:43:53,591 --> 00:43:57,424
There were many people who brought their kids. 

1108
00:43:57,891 --> 00:43:59,691
It must be a great place to go with children. 

1109
00:43:59,691 --> 00:44:01,657
- Yes. / - Yes, it'd be very nice. 

1110
00:44:01,657 --> 00:44:06,624
(Here, you can feed animals and make dairy products) 

1111
00:44:06,724 --> 00:44:08,657
You can feed the animals there. 

1112
00:44:08,657 --> 00:44:11,457
Yes, you can make butter and ride horses there. 

1113
00:44:11,457 --> 00:44:14,057
There are many activities you can do with your kids. 

1114
00:44:14,057 --> 00:44:15,624
It's a great place to visit with children. 

1115
00:44:16,257 --> 00:44:21,191
(Man Man Tour, visiting a farm) 

1116
00:44:21,591 --> 00:44:23,091
We traveled quite a long distance. 

1117
00:44:23,091 --> 00:44:24,624
It was about 300km. 

1118
00:44:24,624 --> 00:44:26,524
She's right. We traveled a long way. 

1119
00:44:26,524 --> 00:44:28,524
- Now... / - We're almost there. 

1120
00:44:28,524 --> 00:44:32,324
We're almost there. Now, I can see a forest. 

1121
00:44:32,324 --> 00:44:33,157
Look. 

1122
00:44:34,091 --> 00:44:36,524
- Look at this road. / - I know. 

1123
00:44:36,524 --> 00:44:37,524
It's so nice. 

1124
00:44:37,524 --> 00:44:39,891
You come out of the city... 

1125
00:44:39,891 --> 00:44:42,591
- And there are wide fields. / - It's completely different. 

1126
00:44:42,591 --> 00:44:45,024
- It's like a picture from a fairytale book. / - I know. 

1127
00:44:45,524 --> 00:44:48,824
- This is... / - It's just like how we imagined. 

1128
00:44:48,824 --> 00:44:51,224
- An amazing view. / - It's the nature of Hokkaido. 

1129
00:44:51,224 --> 00:44:53,291
Such a place reminds you of your children. 

1130
00:44:53,291 --> 00:44:55,691
- It did. / - It totally did. 

1131
00:44:55,691 --> 00:44:57,257
It doesn't look like it at all. 

1132
00:44:57,757 --> 00:44:59,357
It's just the two of them. 

1133
00:45:01,224 --> 00:45:02,357
(After a long ride on the endless road) 

1134
00:45:02,357 --> 00:45:03,624
We've arrived at the farm. 

1135
00:45:03,624 --> 00:45:07,391
(They arrive at the farm in nature) 

1136
00:45:08,824 --> 00:45:11,857
I think we should go this way first. 

1137
00:45:11,857 --> 00:45:16,324
Let's see what's here. You can see small animals. 

1138
00:45:16,324 --> 00:45:19,291
- It's a baby goat. / - Look, it's following him. 

1139
00:45:19,291 --> 00:45:21,591
- Nice to meet you. / - Hello. 

1140
00:45:23,724 --> 00:45:25,957
- It must be hungry. / - Look at it wag its tail. 

1141
00:45:26,391 --> 00:45:28,324
It's a goat but it's like a puppy. 

1142
00:45:28,324 --> 00:45:30,191
You're right. It's so cute. 

1143
00:45:30,191 --> 00:45:32,224
(Yuna gives milk to the baby goat) 

1144
00:45:32,224 --> 00:45:33,391
It's so cute. 

1145
00:45:34,257 --> 00:45:35,991
It must be really hungry. 

1146
00:45:36,424 --> 00:45:38,157
It was drinking very fast. 

1147
00:45:38,157 --> 00:45:40,057
It was wagging its tail while drinking. 

1148
00:45:40,057 --> 00:45:41,957
- My gosh. / - It's almost... 

1149
00:45:41,957 --> 00:45:44,691
- There you go. / - It's like a puppy. 

1150
00:45:44,691 --> 00:45:45,957
- It drinks really fast. / - Look at it wagging its tail. 

1151
00:45:45,957 --> 00:45:47,891
It's like someone drinking a glass of beer bottoms up. 

1152
00:45:48,991 --> 00:45:51,457
- It's drinking really fast. / - It has a big appetite. 

1153
00:45:51,724 --> 00:45:53,557
You should try too. There's not much left. 

1154
00:45:53,557 --> 00:45:56,924
Alright. Is it sleeping? 

1155
00:45:56,924 --> 00:45:58,191
It's wagging its tail. 

1156
00:45:59,191 --> 00:46:03,257
They feed it 4 times a day instead of its mother. 

1157
00:46:03,457 --> 00:46:07,091
- It finished it. / - It finished it. 

1158
00:46:07,091 --> 00:46:09,124
- It's so cute. / - It's going to him. 

1159
00:46:09,124 --> 00:46:10,757
(The baby goat goes back to the instructor) 

1160
00:46:10,757 --> 00:46:13,491
Thank you. Would you like to try holding it? 

1161
00:46:13,491 --> 00:46:15,457
- Really? / - It's really like a puppy. 

1162
00:46:15,457 --> 00:46:16,924
I want to try holding it too. 

1163
00:46:17,524 --> 00:46:19,191
- How adorable. / - It's so cute. 

1164
00:46:19,191 --> 00:46:20,457
It's well-behaved. 

1165
00:46:20,457 --> 00:46:23,024
- It's so nice. / - It's very... 

1166
00:46:23,024 --> 00:46:25,257
- Friendly to people. / - I can feel its heart. 

1167
00:46:25,791 --> 00:46:27,724
- Its heart beats. / - Does it? 

1168
00:46:28,691 --> 00:46:30,224
What is its name? 

1169
00:46:30,224 --> 00:46:32,524
- It's Meme. / - Meme? 

1170
00:46:32,524 --> 00:46:34,924
- Meme. / - Hi, Meme. 

1171
00:46:35,324 --> 00:46:36,691
Meme. 

1172
00:46:36,691 --> 00:46:38,524
- Meme. / - Meme. 

1173
00:46:39,691 --> 00:46:41,491
All the goats there are called Meme. 

1174
00:46:41,491 --> 00:46:43,191
- All the goats are Meme? / - Yes. 

1175
00:46:43,191 --> 00:46:45,324
When the goats grow up, they graze the goats. 

1176
00:46:45,324 --> 00:46:47,857
Then it's hard to call every one of them if they have 

1177
00:46:47,857 --> 00:46:49,191
different names. 

1178
00:46:49,191 --> 00:46:50,124
When they're all called Meme, 

1179
00:46:50,124 --> 00:46:52,157
you can call all of them at once. 

1180
00:46:52,157 --> 00:46:55,757
- So this one is Meme no. 187. / - You're right 

1181
00:46:56,157 --> 00:46:58,191
- It's so cute. / - Meme, nice to meet you. 

1182
00:46:58,191 --> 00:46:59,857
- It was so cute. / - It's looking at him. 

1183
00:46:59,857 --> 00:47:01,957
It's amazing that it's so calm in his arms. 

1184
00:47:01,957 --> 00:47:04,624
My goodness. 

1185
00:47:05,291 --> 00:47:06,491
(It's time to say good-bye to Meme) 

1186
00:47:06,491 --> 00:47:07,924
Thank you. 

1187
00:47:07,924 --> 00:47:10,024
- Bye, Meme. / - Meme. 

1188
00:47:10,024 --> 00:47:12,024
- Meme. / - Meme is wagging its tail. 

1189
00:47:12,224 --> 00:47:13,591
- It was so cute. / - It's so well-behaved. 

1190
00:47:13,591 --> 00:47:15,157
I'm so jealous. 

1191
00:47:15,857 --> 00:47:16,924
Gosh, look at this. 

1192
00:47:17,724 --> 00:47:19,091
It's a cattle shed. 

1193
00:47:19,457 --> 00:47:21,991
This is where the milk cows are. 

1194
00:47:21,991 --> 00:47:23,724
- You can milk the cows here. / - Milking. 

1195
00:47:23,891 --> 00:47:26,091
You can experience cow milking here. 

1196
00:47:26,391 --> 00:47:28,424
The cows look so cool. 

1197
00:47:29,157 --> 00:47:31,991
- Look at its eyes. / - The cows look great. 

1198
00:47:31,991 --> 00:47:34,057
Its eyes look just like Hyungkyu's eyes. 

1199
00:47:34,357 --> 00:47:37,157
I felt like it was my family. I couldn't help but feed it. 

1200
00:47:37,157 --> 00:47:38,991
- They look so similar. / - These are goats. 

1201
00:47:38,991 --> 00:47:41,024
They are a bit... 

1202
00:47:42,691 --> 00:47:44,224
They're so adorable. 

1203
00:47:44,624 --> 00:47:46,991
Meme, let's go. 

1204
00:47:48,091 --> 00:47:49,624
Oh, my. 

1205
00:47:49,824 --> 00:47:52,457
You don't lead the goats 

1206
00:47:52,457 --> 00:47:54,257
but you follow the goats. 

1207
00:47:54,991 --> 00:47:56,891
- You follow the goats. / - Is that the rule? 

1208
00:47:56,891 --> 00:47:59,724
That's the rule. You have to follow the goats. 

1209
00:48:00,291 --> 00:48:02,057
Come this way. 

1210
00:48:02,057 --> 00:48:04,524
(Following Meme, they ended up somewhere) 

1211
00:48:04,524 --> 00:48:06,524
- Look at that. / - Meme. 

1212
00:48:06,757 --> 00:48:08,691
- It's amazing. / - We climbed up here. 

1213
00:48:08,991 --> 00:48:10,391
There are people flying kites. 

1214
00:48:10,857 --> 00:48:13,557
- There are so many kites. / - Shall we go that way? 

1215
00:48:15,257 --> 00:48:20,391
(They have a good view of the whole farm here) 

1216
00:48:21,824 --> 00:48:23,291
(The whole world seems to be colored green) 

1217
00:48:23,291 --> 00:48:24,457
- Look over there. / - It's amazing. 

1218
00:48:25,457 --> 00:48:27,391
- It's really nice. / - That place looks really nice. 

1219
00:48:27,391 --> 00:48:29,457
- It does. / - You'd find inner healing there. 

1220
00:48:29,457 --> 00:48:30,524
How do you like it here? 

1221
00:48:31,491 --> 00:48:33,757
- Honestly, it was fascinating. / - What was? 

1222
00:48:33,757 --> 00:48:35,857
I can't believe I took a walk with a goat. 

1223
00:48:35,857 --> 00:48:38,024
- I couldn't believe it. / - You have never... 

1224
00:48:38,024 --> 00:48:39,991
You have never done that in your life, right? 

1225
00:48:39,991 --> 00:48:41,457
We took a walk with a goat. 

1226
00:48:41,624 --> 00:48:43,424
Now... 

1227
00:48:43,824 --> 00:48:46,791
- Kim Yuna of Jaurim. / - Yes. 

1228
00:48:47,624 --> 00:48:49,824
You said you were going to yodel for me. 

1229
00:48:50,291 --> 00:48:51,824
You're good at yodeling. 

1230
00:48:51,824 --> 00:48:53,224
(On their way to the farm this morning) 

1231
00:48:53,224 --> 00:48:55,524
- Yodeling equals Kim Yuna. / - Is that right? 

1232
00:48:55,991 --> 00:48:57,724
Let's think about it when we get to the farm. 

1233
00:48:57,724 --> 00:49:00,057
Really? Will his wife sing for him? 

1234
00:49:00,057 --> 00:49:02,624
It must be nice that his wife is a singer. 

1235
00:49:04,191 --> 00:49:06,891
(Yodeling) 

1236
00:49:07,757 --> 00:49:09,891
(Yodeling) 

1237
00:49:09,891 --> 00:49:11,491
(Surprised) 

1238
00:49:11,491 --> 00:49:17,657
Shepherds yodeled on top of the mountain 

1239
00:49:17,657 --> 00:49:20,991
in order to communicate with people. 

1240
00:49:21,257 --> 00:49:23,424
(Yodeling) 

1241
00:49:23,557 --> 00:49:25,691
(Yodeling) 

1242
00:49:26,957 --> 00:49:28,157
That's so nice. 

1243
00:49:29,024 --> 00:49:30,391
(Yodeling) 

1244
00:49:30,391 --> 00:49:32,424
(Please hurry and sing after me) 

1245
00:49:32,424 --> 00:49:33,924
You have to raise your voice higher. 

1246
00:49:34,824 --> 00:49:36,991
(The new students of the yodeling class) 

1247
00:49:36,991 --> 00:49:38,924
(Yodeling) 

1248
00:49:38,924 --> 00:49:40,391
She sounds so different to us. 

1249
00:49:40,391 --> 00:49:41,857
You have to raise your voice higher. 

1250
00:49:42,224 --> 00:49:43,357
I shouldn't have asked to do this. 

1251
00:49:43,357 --> 00:49:46,457
You have to put an emphasis on this part. 

1252
00:49:47,357 --> 00:49:51,591
It feels like she's the boss and you're her employee. 

1253
00:49:51,857 --> 00:49:55,124
(I will teach you with love and care until you succeed) 

1254
00:49:55,524 --> 00:49:56,857
(Loud) 

1255
00:49:56,857 --> 00:49:57,924
You're so loud. 

1256
00:50:00,624 --> 00:50:01,724
It seems like he's sleepy. 

1257
00:50:01,724 --> 00:50:03,757
- My eardrums. / - I'm sorry. 

1258
00:50:05,224 --> 00:50:06,591
That's good. 

1259
00:50:06,591 --> 00:50:08,891
(He tries it again properly) 

1260
00:50:09,391 --> 00:50:13,257
(Whatever) 

1261
00:50:13,257 --> 00:50:15,224
I don't think that alcohol was the only thing they had. 

1262
00:50:18,791 --> 00:50:23,091
(As long as we're happy, nothing else matters) 

1263
00:50:25,424 --> 00:50:29,924
(They leave the farm with memories of yodeling) 

1264
00:50:31,391 --> 00:50:32,591
Let's go. 

1265
00:50:33,224 --> 00:50:35,457
- Yuna is driving now. / - That's right. 

1266
00:50:35,691 --> 00:50:37,357
(She looks uncomfortable) 

1267
00:50:37,424 --> 00:50:38,857
This is uncomfortable. 

1268
00:50:39,091 --> 00:50:41,224
(Revving) 

1269
00:50:41,224 --> 00:50:43,424
I'm at the stage where I'm getting to know the car. 

1270
00:50:43,424 --> 00:50:44,357
Honey... 

1271
00:50:45,624 --> 00:50:46,757
Don't drive too fast. 

1272
00:50:47,491 --> 00:50:50,524
I think Yuna drives more roughly. 

1273
00:50:50,791 --> 00:50:51,991
(Takes a look) 

1274
00:50:51,991 --> 00:50:53,657
This is scary. 

1275
00:50:54,991 --> 00:50:56,224
Maybe I should have driven. 

1276
00:50:58,124 --> 00:51:02,057
(Anxious and restless) 

1277
00:51:02,424 --> 00:51:05,424
My wife and I are similar in many ways. 

1278
00:51:05,424 --> 00:51:08,057
One thing different is our driving styles. 

1279
00:51:08,757 --> 00:51:12,157
I keep safety first enough to make people... 

1280
00:51:12,157 --> 00:51:14,391
- Frustrated. / - You put safety first. 

1281
00:51:14,391 --> 00:51:17,291
Even if we are tight on time... 

1282
00:51:18,091 --> 00:51:20,624
I say, "Safety is the most important thing." 

1283
00:51:20,624 --> 00:51:22,257
I don't change lanes. 

1284
00:51:22,257 --> 00:51:25,557
I think there isn't a big difference 

1285
00:51:25,557 --> 00:51:27,924
if we drive on this lane or that lane. 

1286
00:51:27,924 --> 00:51:30,157
But my wife drives roughly. 

1287
00:51:30,757 --> 00:51:33,291
She drives like a rocker, just a bit. 

1288
00:51:33,657 --> 00:51:35,357
I didn't know he said this. 

1289
00:51:35,357 --> 00:51:37,757
- Singers are rough. / - That's right. 

1290
00:51:37,757 --> 00:51:39,624
- We always have a lot of schedules. / - That's right. 

1291
00:51:39,957 --> 00:51:41,757
(Yuna drives without hesitation) 

1292
00:51:41,757 --> 00:51:43,324
- It's raining slightly. / - Yes. 

1293
00:51:43,724 --> 00:51:45,591
It's raining slightly. 

1294
00:51:45,591 --> 00:51:47,991
It's so nice that it's raining slightly. 

1295
00:51:49,324 --> 00:51:50,524
It's nice. 

1296
00:51:50,924 --> 00:51:53,457
Do you know the song, "Come Rain or Come Shine?" 

1297
00:51:54,157 --> 00:51:55,457
Of course, I know it. 

1298
00:51:55,457 --> 00:51:58,491
♪ Nobody's loved you ♪ 

1299
00:51:59,091 --> 00:52:03,424
(Her sweet voice is added to the rainy scenery) 

1300
00:52:03,757 --> 00:52:05,691
(Looks at her sweetly) 

1301
00:52:06,391 --> 00:52:09,691
- It's nice. / - ♪ Happy together ♪ 

1302
00:52:13,457 --> 00:52:14,657
I love it so much. 

1303
00:52:16,191 --> 00:52:18,124
Is she also singing for you when she's driving? 

1304
00:52:18,124 --> 00:52:19,757
That's really nice. 

1305
00:52:19,757 --> 00:52:22,024
- It was coincidental. / - That's right. 

1306
00:52:22,557 --> 00:52:28,157
(Come rain or come shine) 

1307
00:52:29,924 --> 00:52:37,857
(High as a mountain, deep as a river) 

1308
00:52:37,857 --> 00:52:43,891
(Come rain or come shine) 

1309
00:52:45,757 --> 00:52:47,224
It was perfect for that day. 

1310
00:52:47,224 --> 00:52:48,791
(The wife who couldn't help her musician spirit) 

1311
00:52:49,024 --> 00:52:52,291
It is a song saying that I will love you come rain... 

1312
00:52:53,124 --> 00:52:54,691
Or come shine. 

1313
00:52:54,691 --> 00:52:56,257
(She was reminded of "Come Rain or Come Shine") 

1314
00:52:56,257 --> 00:53:00,557
There will be happy and unhappy days while we live. 

1315
00:53:01,457 --> 00:53:04,324
It could rain or sun might shine. 

1316
00:53:04,957 --> 00:53:07,291
The song is about that. 

1317
00:53:12,957 --> 00:53:17,191
Turn right after 400m. 

1318
00:53:17,957 --> 00:53:20,591
(Embarrassed) 

1319
00:53:20,591 --> 00:53:23,124
- I'll just be quiet and drive. / - It's okay. It was nice. 

1320
00:53:23,391 --> 00:53:24,891
We were creating a nice mood 

1321
00:53:24,891 --> 00:53:26,724
and the GPS suddenly shouted at us. 

1322
00:53:26,724 --> 00:53:27,791
(He's blaming the GPS for no reason) 

1323
00:53:28,824 --> 00:53:31,057
- Like, "Focus on driving." / - ♪ Days may be... ♪ 

1324
00:53:31,057 --> 00:53:33,624
♪ Cloudy or sunny ♪ 

1325
00:53:34,291 --> 00:53:35,891
- Turn right. / - Yes, ma'am. 

1326
00:53:36,191 --> 00:53:37,357
(Laughing) 

1327
00:53:38,991 --> 00:53:40,524
The GPS stopped us... 

1328
00:53:40,624 --> 00:53:42,191
When we were in the middle of singing. 

1329
00:53:42,191 --> 00:53:44,291
- It told us to drive. / - It must have been listening. 

1330
00:53:44,291 --> 00:53:47,024
(It was a good interjection to focus on driving) 

1331
00:53:47,357 --> 00:53:51,891
I want to see a beautiful garden or forest. 

1332
00:53:51,891 --> 00:53:53,824
They prepared thoroughly. 

1333
00:53:53,824 --> 00:53:56,124
- The lavender season is over. / - Yes. 

1334
00:53:56,357 --> 00:53:58,657
The lavender season is over in July. 

1335
00:53:58,657 --> 00:54:01,557
- We covered the lavender season. / - Yes. 

1336
00:54:01,557 --> 00:54:03,057
- Lee Gookju went there. / - That's right. 

1337
00:54:03,057 --> 00:54:05,091
They went there to take the best photos of their life. 

1338
00:54:05,091 --> 00:54:06,757
They made videos. 

1339
00:54:07,391 --> 00:54:10,124
It's not a lavender garden... 

1340
00:54:10,124 --> 00:54:11,791
- But we'll see a flower garden. / - If it's possible... 

1341
00:54:11,791 --> 00:54:13,957
I want to see a garden with flowers in full bloom. 

1342
00:54:13,957 --> 00:54:16,791
Won't there be a farm nearby there? 

1343
00:54:17,557 --> 00:54:22,491
(Man Man Tour, Shikisai No Oka) 

1344
00:54:23,057 --> 00:54:24,457
(2 hours and 20 minutes by car to Shikisai No Oka) 

1345
00:54:24,457 --> 00:54:25,524
It takes 2 hours and 20 minutes by car? 

1346
00:54:25,524 --> 00:54:26,891
- We drove for long. / - Yes. 

1347
00:54:27,224 --> 00:54:30,191
We drove over 2 hours that day. 

1348
00:54:30,191 --> 00:54:31,891
The way there was also nice. 

1349
00:54:32,324 --> 00:54:34,057
We're here. 

1350
00:54:34,057 --> 00:54:35,224
You went through a lot. 

1351
00:54:35,224 --> 00:54:37,257
We're here at... 

1352
00:54:37,691 --> 00:54:39,924
- Shikisai... / - Shikisai No Oka. 

1353
00:54:39,924 --> 00:54:41,391
- We're finally here. / - Yes. 

1354
00:54:41,391 --> 00:54:42,557
I researched about it. 

1355
00:54:42,557 --> 00:54:44,624
It says flower garden view here. 

1356
00:54:44,624 --> 00:54:45,791
The flowers bloom... 

1357
00:54:46,224 --> 00:54:49,024
- Starting from May to October. / - Yes. 

1358
00:54:49,024 --> 00:54:51,824
There are several kinds of flowers. 

1359
00:54:52,091 --> 00:54:54,557
- I researched it. / - Good job. 

1360
00:54:54,557 --> 00:54:55,824
Tulips start to bloom... 

1361
00:54:55,824 --> 00:54:57,624
- In May. / - Let's go and check it out. 

1362
00:54:58,524 --> 00:55:00,157
It seems like she's your boss 

1363
00:55:00,157 --> 00:55:01,757
and you're her employee. 

1364
00:55:03,591 --> 00:55:05,491
I'm looking forward to what kind of flowers there are. 

1365
00:55:05,491 --> 00:55:07,857
- Hello. / - Hello. 

1366
00:55:08,291 --> 00:55:09,191
Wait a minute. 

1367
00:55:09,191 --> 00:55:10,924
I need to take these. 

1368
00:55:10,924 --> 00:55:12,991
- That's right. / - Why don't you take it after? 

1369
00:55:12,991 --> 00:55:14,291
Are you taking these right now? 

1370
00:55:14,291 --> 00:55:16,457
I have to take it with me right now... 

1371
00:55:16,457 --> 00:55:18,191
- To get information. / - That's right. 

1372
00:55:18,191 --> 00:55:21,791
I always take pamphlets with me of a certain spot 

1373
00:55:21,791 --> 00:55:23,291
whenever I go to another country. 

1374
00:55:23,791 --> 00:55:24,691
I keep them. 

1375
00:55:25,457 --> 00:55:27,157
If you collect those... 

1376
00:55:27,157 --> 00:55:28,891
- lt's nice to see them later. / - It's fun. 

1377
00:55:28,891 --> 00:55:30,657
- You feel proud, and it's nice. / - Of course. 

1378
00:55:32,091 --> 00:55:33,124
Look at this. 

1379
00:55:33,657 --> 00:55:35,391
It's a travel guide. 

1380
00:55:35,391 --> 00:55:36,891
I brought the one from 2015. 

1381
00:55:37,424 --> 00:55:38,391
I still have it. 

1382
00:55:38,391 --> 00:55:40,691
The 2015 travel guide is useless now. 

1383
00:55:40,891 --> 00:55:43,124
It only takes up luggage space. 

1384
00:55:43,424 --> 00:55:45,524
We don't need 

1385
00:55:45,524 --> 00:55:46,591
old pamphlets. 

1386
00:55:46,591 --> 00:55:47,857
The information changes. 

1387
00:55:48,124 --> 00:55:49,291
The roads change. 

1388
00:55:50,791 --> 00:55:52,457
It doesn't help at all. 

1389
00:55:54,324 --> 00:55:55,691
He's just collecting them. 

1390
00:55:55,691 --> 00:55:57,224
- It's a personal goal. / - That's right. 

1391
00:55:57,224 --> 00:55:59,924
- They're memories. / - It's to satisfy my own desire. 

1392
00:55:59,924 --> 00:56:03,057
I think there's a flower garden here already. 

1393
00:56:03,857 --> 00:56:05,091
I don't think... 

1394
00:56:05,991 --> 00:56:07,657
These gardens are special. 

1395
00:56:08,257 --> 00:56:10,857
Of course, we have already seen a lot of... 

1396
00:56:10,857 --> 00:56:13,124
- Flower gardens like these. / - In our neighborhood. 

1397
00:56:13,391 --> 00:56:14,824
- In our neighborhood? / - In our neighborhood... 

1398
00:56:14,824 --> 00:56:16,457
- Apartment building. / - Is that true? 

1399
00:56:16,457 --> 00:56:19,457
There are gardens like these in our apartment. 

1400
00:56:19,457 --> 00:56:21,957
I was a little disappointed at the entrance. 

1401
00:56:21,957 --> 00:56:23,124
Do people come here to see this? 

1402
00:56:23,457 --> 00:56:25,257
It feels like a failure 

1403
00:56:25,257 --> 00:56:26,724
seeing just this. 

1404
00:56:26,724 --> 00:56:27,791
Failure? 

1405
00:56:27,791 --> 00:56:29,724
- The weather isn't nice. / - That's right. 

1406
00:56:30,024 --> 00:56:31,524
Let's go in. 

1407
00:56:31,524 --> 00:56:34,257
This is interesting. 

1408
00:56:34,591 --> 00:56:36,557
This is interesting. This is a little interesting. 

1409
00:56:36,557 --> 00:56:37,891
(He's showing interest in other things) 

1410
00:56:38,557 --> 00:56:40,157
This is a little... 

1411
00:56:40,157 --> 00:56:42,924
I want to take photos but I don't have any hands. 

1412
00:56:42,924 --> 00:56:45,257
- Let's get on the bus first. / - Okay. 

1413
00:56:45,424 --> 00:56:47,191
- It's because... / - He wanted to take a photo. 

1414
00:56:47,191 --> 00:56:48,291
Yes. 

1415
00:56:48,291 --> 00:56:50,591
- Yuna is cold at times like that. / - Yes. 

1416
00:56:50,591 --> 00:56:52,924
- She didn't take photos. / - I had a lot of stuff. 

1417
00:56:52,924 --> 00:56:54,057
So I couldn't take photos for him. 

1418
00:56:54,057 --> 00:56:56,624
We're on a bus being pulled by a tractor. 

1419
00:56:57,524 --> 00:56:58,757
I like things like this. 

1420
00:56:59,924 --> 00:57:02,191
Did I plan wrong? 

1421
00:57:02,657 --> 00:57:05,557
We don't know yet. 

1422
00:57:06,124 --> 00:57:08,324
Look at the top of that hill. 

1423
00:57:08,324 --> 00:57:09,791
That looks beautiful. 

1424
00:57:09,791 --> 00:57:11,124
We'll go up there on this bus... 

1425
00:57:11,691 --> 00:57:13,757
Where we can see it properly. 

1426
00:57:14,191 --> 00:57:15,391
We're moving. 

1427
00:57:15,391 --> 00:57:19,757
The tractor bus will lead you there 

1428
00:57:19,757 --> 00:57:21,524
if you pay around $5.10. 

1429
00:57:21,691 --> 00:57:23,391
There must be something. 

1430
00:57:23,391 --> 00:57:24,591
I'm looking forward to it. 

1431
00:57:24,957 --> 00:57:27,591
- I'm looking forward to it. / - Wait a minute. 

1432
00:57:29,457 --> 00:57:32,024
I know what you're talking about 

1433
00:57:32,024 --> 00:57:33,191
since we're on the hill. 

1434
00:57:33,191 --> 00:57:34,557
It's so big. 

1435
00:57:34,557 --> 00:57:37,324
(What does the flower garden look like?) 

1436
00:57:37,324 --> 00:57:38,457
Look at that. 

1437
00:57:40,924 --> 00:57:42,457
It's so pretty. 

1438
00:57:42,457 --> 00:57:43,524
How did they make that? 

1439
00:57:43,524 --> 00:57:45,357
(Located in Biei with flowers for every season) 

1440
00:57:45,357 --> 00:57:47,357
- There are sunflowers. / - You can take the best photos. 

1441
00:57:47,357 --> 00:57:48,724
- Photos of your life. / - Yes, of your life. 

1442
00:57:49,524 --> 00:57:50,824
This is the amazing part. 

1443
00:57:50,824 --> 00:57:52,057
It's so pretty. 

1444
00:57:52,824 --> 00:57:53,724
(Impressed) 

1445
00:57:53,724 --> 00:57:55,291
This is really amazing. 

1446
00:57:56,257 --> 00:57:58,557
(A vast flower garden is spread endlessly) 

1447
00:57:58,557 --> 00:58:00,224
- It was a surprising view. / - It's like a picture. 

1448
00:58:00,224 --> 00:58:03,091
- The colors are amazing. / - Isn't it amazing? 

1449
00:58:03,491 --> 00:58:06,157
(Happy) 

1450
00:58:06,157 --> 00:58:08,124
- How did they make this? / - This is my first time... 

1451
00:58:08,124 --> 00:58:10,624
- Coming here. / - That's right. 

1452
00:58:10,624 --> 00:58:12,324
It's a very surprising view. 

1453
00:58:12,891 --> 00:58:14,257
Different flowers are planted... 

1454
00:58:14,257 --> 00:58:17,291
- According to their rows. / - There are lavenders. 

1455
00:58:17,757 --> 00:58:19,691
- I think it's really big. / - It's really big. 

1456
00:58:19,691 --> 00:58:21,424
(The big carpet is embroidered with flowers in line) 

1457
00:58:21,424 --> 00:58:23,391
- It's a giant's carpet. / - You're right. 

1458
00:58:24,524 --> 00:58:27,557
Different flowers bloom for each season. 

1459
00:58:27,891 --> 00:58:29,557
They also take care of different flowers. 

1460
00:58:29,557 --> 00:58:31,091
- They have different sections. / - That's wonderful. 

1461
00:58:31,091 --> 00:58:32,291
(They arrive at the viewpoint of the flower garden) 

1462
00:58:32,291 --> 00:58:34,257
Have you ever seen flowers planted 

1463
00:58:34,257 --> 00:58:34,691
on this large a scale? 

1464
00:58:34,691 --> 00:58:35,957
This is my first time. 

1465
00:58:35,957 --> 00:58:37,857
- Right? This is also amazing. / - What I said earlier... 

1466
00:58:38,491 --> 00:58:43,824
- I would like to apologize... / - Apologize quickly. 

1467
00:58:43,824 --> 00:58:44,891
About it being like my apartment. 

1468
00:58:45,091 --> 00:58:47,157
- It feels like my eyes... / - It's colorful. 

1469
00:58:47,157 --> 00:58:48,524
Are wide-open. 

1470
00:58:48,591 --> 00:58:49,757
It feels exactly like that. 

1471
00:58:50,757 --> 00:58:54,391
(You can't forget photos in front of an amazing view) 

1472
00:58:54,924 --> 00:58:57,257
(Focused) 

1473
00:58:59,324 --> 00:59:00,991
I think it will be nice to go with your lover. 

1474
00:59:01,224 --> 00:59:04,357
A married couple special is surely filled with love. 

1475
00:59:06,891 --> 00:59:09,157
(We've never seen a more beautiful garden) 

1476
00:59:09,157 --> 00:59:11,391
(We'd like to apologize for enjoying this alone) 

1477
00:59:11,824 --> 00:59:13,691
- I can't explain what I'm seeing... / - Yes. 

1478
00:59:14,024 --> 00:59:16,757
- With words. / - We can't capture it in photos. 

1479
00:59:17,224 --> 00:59:19,924
- For this trip... / - Yes. 

1480
00:59:20,224 --> 00:59:21,791
I rented out the whole place. 

1481
00:59:21,791 --> 00:59:23,024
(They are the only ones there in the large garden) 

1482
00:59:23,024 --> 00:59:25,257
I rented it. No one is here. 

1483
00:59:25,257 --> 00:59:26,524
- That's right. / - Yes. 

1484
00:59:26,524 --> 00:59:28,224
- No one is here. / - We rented the place. 

1485
00:59:28,224 --> 00:59:29,791
- No one is here. / - Yes. 

1486
00:59:30,157 --> 00:59:31,957
No one is here except us. 

1487
00:59:31,957 --> 00:59:33,691
It was raining a little bit, 

1488
00:59:33,691 --> 00:59:35,091
so we were the only ones there. 

1489
00:59:35,391 --> 00:59:37,824
- That's so amazing. / - It was so surprising. 

1490
00:59:38,391 --> 00:59:40,224
I liked the rain. 

1491
00:59:40,224 --> 00:59:41,657
- Yes. / - It's like a painting. 

1492
00:59:41,657 --> 00:59:43,324
- It's so pretty. / - It's unbelievable. 

1493
00:59:43,491 --> 00:59:45,724
The weather helped them to enjoy the place. 

1494
00:59:45,724 --> 00:59:47,391
- How is that possible? / - It's so beautiful. 

1495
00:59:47,624 --> 00:59:50,291
This looks like it's CG. 

1496
00:59:50,291 --> 00:59:52,157
- Isn't it strange and unrealistic, right? / - Yes. 

1497
00:59:52,157 --> 00:59:54,191
I think you wouldn't want to leave this place. 

1498
00:59:55,091 --> 00:59:58,357
This is amazing. It's a spectacle. 

1499
00:59:58,357 --> 00:59:59,824
It really is a spectacle. 

1500
01:00:01,091 --> 01:00:04,191
It's nice when it rains. 

1501
01:00:04,591 --> 01:00:06,191
And it's still nice when it doesn't rain. 

1502
01:00:06,191 --> 01:00:07,791
But it's amazing since it's raining. 

1503
01:00:07,791 --> 01:00:09,557
I like it so much because it's raining. 

1504
01:00:11,591 --> 01:00:14,291
Everything is so nice. It's nice when it's sunny. 

1505
01:00:14,291 --> 01:00:18,524
The view and the colors would have been brighter 

1506
01:00:18,524 --> 01:00:21,691
but you wouldn't know the view when it rains. 

1507
01:00:21,691 --> 01:00:23,957
I think it felt different that way. 

1508
01:00:25,224 --> 01:00:27,124
Honestly, I think it's better because of the rain. 

1509
01:00:27,124 --> 01:00:29,324
- It's more picturesque. / - Yes. 

1510
01:00:30,491 --> 01:00:33,524
Since we took a walk... 

1511
01:00:33,524 --> 01:00:35,224
- We're hungry, right? / - I'm hungry. 

1512
01:00:35,224 --> 01:00:37,457
Let's go to the next spot. 

1513
01:00:37,457 --> 01:00:39,424
- Will we eat something? / - We will eat something. 

1514
01:00:39,424 --> 01:00:41,291
- Good. / - We'll eat something we like. 

1515
01:00:41,291 --> 01:00:42,991
- Let's go quickly. / - What could that be? 

1516
01:00:44,524 --> 01:00:46,891
- Since we're going there... / - He's not working again. 

1517
01:00:47,757 --> 01:00:49,357
- Patients are waiting for him. / - No, that's not true. 

1518
01:00:49,357 --> 01:00:50,957
I was doing that during my spare time. 

1519
01:00:50,957 --> 01:00:52,224
I don't think that's true. 

1520
01:00:52,224 --> 01:00:54,191
I think it will be okay if we ate ramen. 

1521
01:00:54,624 --> 01:00:58,524
Yuna doesn't like ramen or instant noodles that much. 

1522
01:01:00,191 --> 01:01:02,591
But we have a unique memory... 

1523
01:01:03,224 --> 01:01:05,624
About ramen. 

1524
01:01:07,191 --> 01:01:08,657
I think it will be okay... 

1525
01:01:09,091 --> 01:01:11,291
If we ate ramen for one meal... 

1526
01:01:11,957 --> 01:01:13,457
For my own personal desire. 

1527
01:01:13,457 --> 01:01:15,524
A course for you? That's dangerous. 

1528
01:01:15,524 --> 01:01:18,024
My wife doesn't like ramen. 

1529
01:01:18,924 --> 01:01:20,591
But you went to a place where they only sold ramen? 

1530
01:01:20,591 --> 01:01:22,791
- Yes. / - He likes that kind of food. 

1531
01:01:22,791 --> 01:01:27,657
(Man Man Tour, 1 of the 3 best ramens in Hokkaido) 

1532
01:01:28,824 --> 01:01:29,991
- It's quite far. / - Yes, it's far. 

1533
01:01:29,991 --> 01:01:32,424
It was a little distant from where we were. 

1534
01:01:32,424 --> 01:01:33,957
The distance is quite far. 

1535
01:01:34,591 --> 01:01:41,124
(Darkness has come to Asahikawa already) 

1536
01:01:43,957 --> 01:01:47,591
Asahikawa is the second biggest city in Hokkaido 

1537
01:01:47,591 --> 01:01:48,491
after Sapporo. 

1538
01:01:48,491 --> 01:01:50,124
That's why this place... 

1539
01:01:50,124 --> 01:01:52,224
- Is getting popular. / - That's right. 

1540
01:01:53,124 --> 01:01:54,424
I saw that there was a... 

1541
01:01:54,891 --> 01:01:58,424
- JR line here in Asahikawa. / - Yes, it's here. 

1542
01:01:58,957 --> 01:02:02,024
- We could come here by the JR Train... / - Right. 

1543
01:02:02,024 --> 01:02:04,224
- From Sapporo. / - Right. 

1544
01:02:04,557 --> 01:02:05,924
- It's nice. / - It's perfect. 

1545
01:02:06,091 --> 01:02:08,557
- It feels so nice... / - Yes. 

1546
01:02:08,557 --> 01:02:09,724
(The chilly weather reminds you of warm soup) 

1547
01:02:09,724 --> 01:02:10,991
Since it's raining. 

1548
01:02:11,357 --> 01:02:12,691
- I like it better this way. / - Yes. 

1549
01:02:12,691 --> 01:02:14,691
It's raining. This is the place. 

1550
01:02:14,691 --> 01:02:16,991
- Is this the place? / - That's right. 

1551
01:02:18,424 --> 01:02:19,691
It has 70 years of tradition. 

1552
01:02:20,257 --> 01:02:22,057
I'm really looking forward to it. 

1553
01:02:22,057 --> 01:02:23,191
- Let's go inside. / - Okay. 

1554
01:02:23,424 --> 01:02:26,024
- Let's go inside. / - Let's go inside. 

1555
01:02:26,024 --> 01:02:28,224
Excuse me. 

1556
01:02:28,224 --> 01:02:29,524
Yes. 

1557
01:02:29,757 --> 01:02:31,391
- Hello. / - Hello. 

1558
01:02:31,791 --> 01:02:33,857
That place must be delicious. 

1559
01:02:33,857 --> 01:02:35,591
- This place was really delicious. / - Sikyung knows... 

1560
01:02:35,591 --> 01:02:37,991
- When he sees the entrance. / - I know. 

1561
01:02:39,024 --> 01:02:43,591
(A meal of ramen for Hyungkyu) 

1562
01:02:44,324 --> 01:02:48,791
(The noodles are so firm, it can't be compared) 

1563
01:02:49,324 --> 01:02:53,657
(This place has a special secret broth) 

1564
01:02:54,357 --> 01:03:00,957
(1 of the 3 best ramens, Asahikawa ramen) 

1565
01:03:01,157 --> 01:03:02,891
What's the signature dish? 

1566
01:03:02,891 --> 01:03:05,957
That's why I brought a comic book... 

1567
01:03:05,957 --> 01:03:08,557
- About ramen. / - Can't we order first? 

1568
01:03:08,557 --> 01:03:10,724
We have to see this before we order. 

1569
01:03:11,324 --> 01:03:12,957
- He's starting again. / - We have to see this. 

1570
01:03:12,957 --> 01:03:14,657
- They're going to fight here. / - We have to see this. 

1571
01:03:14,657 --> 01:03:15,857
We have to see this. 

1572
01:03:15,857 --> 01:03:16,957
(Why did he take out a comic book suddenly?) 

1573
01:03:16,957 --> 01:03:18,224
Let's see. 

1574
01:03:19,091 --> 01:03:20,157
(Hyungkyu's study, before departure) 

1575
01:03:20,157 --> 01:03:22,391
- There are so many comic books. / - That's right. 

1576
01:03:22,391 --> 01:03:23,724
This is a very important book. 

1577
01:03:24,891 --> 01:03:27,091
- "What is Ramen?" / - What kind of book is that? 

1578
01:03:27,091 --> 01:03:28,957
- There is. / - That's so interesting. 

1579
01:03:29,091 --> 01:03:31,157
It's a comic book about ramen. 

1580
01:03:31,157 --> 01:03:33,191
It has a lot of good information. 

1581
01:03:33,424 --> 01:03:35,091
I really should take it with me. 

1582
01:03:36,057 --> 01:03:37,357
- If you see here... / - Yes. 

1583
01:03:37,357 --> 01:03:38,591
(What are the 3 best ramens in Hokkaido?) 

1584
01:03:38,591 --> 01:03:40,324
There are three best ramens... 

1585
01:03:40,324 --> 01:03:43,057
- In Hokkaido. / - Yes, there are three best ramens. 

1586
01:03:43,657 --> 01:03:45,857
Miso ramen in Sapporo. 

1587
01:03:46,157 --> 01:03:48,257
Shio ramen in Hakodate, 

1588
01:03:48,257 --> 01:03:50,991
and shoyu ramen in Asahikawa. 

1589
01:03:51,391 --> 01:03:53,791
These 3 ramen are 

1590
01:03:53,791 --> 01:03:55,924
the 3 best ramen in Hokkaido. 

1591
01:03:56,691 --> 01:04:00,491
They also have shoyu ramen. 

1592
01:04:00,491 --> 01:04:01,891
- Let's order that. / - That's famous. 

1593
01:04:01,891 --> 01:04:03,057
- Is that famous there? / - Yes. 

1594
01:04:03,724 --> 01:04:04,891
- I did some research. / - Yes. 

1595
01:04:05,157 --> 01:04:07,691
There's a point to focus... 

1596
01:04:07,991 --> 01:04:10,424
On this Asahikawa ramen. 

1597
01:04:11,157 --> 01:04:12,524
If you see here... 

1598
01:04:13,591 --> 01:04:16,391
Can't we order first and talk while they cook? 

1599
01:04:16,391 --> 01:04:18,224
Can't you order quickly? 

1600
01:04:18,224 --> 01:04:20,424
Yuna should have made a fuss. 

1601
01:04:21,057 --> 01:04:23,691
It tastes better when you do this. 

1602
01:04:24,857 --> 01:04:27,091
Can't we order first and talk while they cook? 

1603
01:04:27,091 --> 01:04:28,557
- Okay. / - My stomach is making sounds. 

1604
01:04:28,557 --> 01:04:30,124
I'll order shoyu ramen. 

1605
01:04:30,124 --> 01:04:32,224
- Should we order one each? / - That sounds nice. 

1606
01:04:32,224 --> 01:04:34,491
Shoyu ramen and shio ramen. 

1607
01:04:34,491 --> 01:04:35,657
- Shio ramen? / - Yes. 

1608
01:04:36,324 --> 01:04:38,991
- Is he cooking in front of you? / - Yes. 

1609
01:04:39,324 --> 01:04:40,191
Is that the kitchen? 

1610
01:04:40,191 --> 01:04:42,724
Asahikawa shoyu ramen... 

1611
01:04:43,057 --> 01:04:44,791
Doesn't have one type of broth. 

1612
01:04:45,791 --> 01:04:48,491
- They don't use just one ingredient. / - Right. 

1613
01:04:49,124 --> 01:04:52,324
They mix meat broth and seafood broth... 

1614
01:04:52,324 --> 01:04:53,891
- And make it. / - Do they use double ingredients? 

1615
01:04:54,457 --> 01:04:56,857
In other words, 

1616
01:04:56,857 --> 01:04:59,657
it's a combination of meat and seafood. 

1617
01:05:00,924 --> 01:05:02,324
- It's like the combination of us. / - That's right. 

1618
01:05:04,524 --> 01:05:06,724
- The noodles are important. / - You have to slurp it up. 

1619
01:05:06,724 --> 01:05:10,724
They make the noodles by hand there. 

1620
01:05:11,024 --> 01:05:12,991
- With two types of broth... / - And soy sauce. 

1621
01:05:12,991 --> 01:05:16,424
They use meat and seafood like for Jinju cold noodles. 

1622
01:05:16,424 --> 01:05:18,724
- That looks good. / - It was really good. 

1623
01:05:18,724 --> 01:05:19,724
(He smacks his lips) 

1624
01:05:20,657 --> 01:05:23,291
(Shoyu ramen, $7.70) 

1625
01:05:23,291 --> 01:05:25,924
(Shio ramen, $7.70) 

1626
01:05:27,124 --> 01:05:30,424
Usually, there's 30% moisture in noodles 

1627
01:05:30,424 --> 01:05:33,524
but they have less than 20% here, so it's chewy 

1628
01:05:33,524 --> 01:05:35,491
and the broth is absorbed by the noodles. 

1629
01:05:35,891 --> 01:05:37,724
- Thank you for the food. / - Thank you for the food. 

1630
01:05:40,024 --> 01:05:41,757
- I'm going to try the soup first. / - That's right. 

1631
01:05:41,757 --> 01:05:45,257
(You should try the soup first when you eat ramen) 

1632
01:05:48,624 --> 01:05:50,024
It has a really refreshing taste. 

1633
01:05:50,257 --> 01:05:53,824
(Refreshed) 

1634
01:05:56,624 --> 01:05:59,357
- The weather is a little chilly... / - It suits the weather? 

1635
01:05:59,357 --> 01:06:01,091
Because of the rain. 

1636
01:06:01,657 --> 01:06:03,391
It would be perfect for a hangover cure. 

1637
01:06:05,724 --> 01:06:07,891
This one is good. 

1638
01:06:07,891 --> 01:06:09,757
- This one is good. / - Yes. 

1639
01:06:09,757 --> 01:06:14,257
I heard that there was a secret method to the broth. 

1640
01:06:14,257 --> 01:06:15,524
(Shoyu ramen is the best dish) 

1641
01:06:15,524 --> 01:06:17,824
They made the soup with seafood broth, 

1642
01:06:17,824 --> 01:06:21,057
pork broth and pork fat. 

1643
01:06:21,591 --> 01:06:23,224
It has a deep taste. 

1644
01:06:23,224 --> 01:06:25,157
They must have done a lot of research. 

1645
01:06:25,657 --> 01:06:27,824
- Let's try the noodles now. / - But... 

1646
01:06:27,824 --> 01:06:29,191
- I'm going to try the noodles. / - Okay. 

1647
01:06:30,891 --> 01:06:34,391
(Slurping) 

1648
01:06:35,157 --> 01:06:38,057
(I can't believe this taste) 

1649
01:06:39,557 --> 01:06:40,791
The flavor has depth. 

1650
01:06:43,857 --> 01:06:45,357
- The noodles are also delicious. / - Yes. 

1651
01:06:46,124 --> 01:06:50,057
(He sucks it in without even breathing) 

1652
01:06:51,891 --> 01:06:53,657
- It was really good. / - I'm hungry. 

1653
01:06:53,657 --> 01:06:56,691
- Shall I make some instant noodles? / - Yes. 

1654
01:06:57,324 --> 01:06:59,491
You're saying that the noodles are firm, right? 

1655
01:06:59,491 --> 01:07:02,157
- That's not enough to explain it. / - It's bouncy. 

1656
01:07:02,157 --> 01:07:03,457
- Is it bouncy? / - Yes, it's bouncy. 

1657
01:07:03,457 --> 01:07:05,024
Noodles should be chewy. 

1658
01:07:05,257 --> 01:07:06,824
You can only eat those noodles... 

1659
01:07:06,824 --> 01:07:09,291
- When you're there, right? / - You're right. 

1660
01:07:09,291 --> 01:07:11,791
- It's raw noodles. / - You can't imitate that. 

1661
01:07:12,891 --> 01:07:14,791
It has great texture. 

1662
01:07:16,257 --> 01:07:17,691
Is it good? 

1663
01:07:17,691 --> 01:07:19,391
- It's really good. / - Thank you. 

1664
01:07:19,391 --> 01:07:20,757
It's really good. 

1665
01:07:21,724 --> 01:07:25,491
(They're really into it) 

1666
01:07:25,491 --> 01:07:26,691
Isn't it delicious? 

1667
01:07:28,024 --> 01:07:32,091
Hokkaido, Asahikawa shoyu ramen. 

1668
01:07:32,424 --> 01:07:35,157
They put meat and seafood broth 

1669
01:07:35,157 --> 01:07:36,957
and added fat from meat. 

1670
01:07:37,691 --> 01:07:40,457
- Is that in Korean? / - They understood. 

1671
01:07:40,691 --> 01:07:41,724
Bravo. 

1672
01:07:43,191 --> 01:07:44,591
(What's he doing?) 

1673
01:07:44,591 --> 01:07:46,957
- They're saying different things. / - That's too much. 

1674
01:07:46,957 --> 01:07:48,624
(Did he understand?) 

1675
01:07:48,624 --> 01:07:50,991
I got complimented because of a comic book. 

1676
01:07:52,624 --> 01:07:56,224
It wasn't a waste to bring the comics. 

1677
01:07:56,891 --> 01:07:58,191
I'm going to eat again. 

1678
01:08:02,524 --> 01:08:03,857
I thought you didn't like it. 

1679
01:08:03,857 --> 01:08:08,891
This was either the best or second best ramen... 

1680
01:08:08,891 --> 01:08:10,024
- I ever had in my life. / - Is this the best again? 

1681
01:08:10,024 --> 01:08:10,991
It's really good. 

1682
01:08:10,991 --> 01:08:12,957
Why did they experience so many bests? 

1683
01:08:13,424 --> 01:08:15,557
- This is interesting. / - Yes? 

1684
01:08:15,624 --> 01:08:17,824
When we eat noodles in Korea, 

1685
01:08:17,824 --> 01:08:20,691
we learn that it's rude... 

1686
01:08:20,691 --> 01:08:23,557
- To make slurping noises. / - Yes. 

1687
01:08:23,724 --> 01:08:26,024
But in Japan, 

1688
01:08:26,024 --> 01:08:29,757
you have to make sounds when you eat noodles 

1689
01:08:29,757 --> 01:08:31,291
to express how good it is. 

1690
01:08:31,591 --> 01:08:33,391
- You're doing a good job. / - You're doing well too. 

1691
01:08:33,557 --> 01:08:36,124
- Is it good to make sounds in Japan? / - Yes. 

1692
01:08:36,124 --> 01:08:37,224
(The standard of the standard) 

1693
01:08:37,224 --> 01:08:41,391
We did a lot of non-daily experiences today. 

1694
01:08:41,757 --> 01:08:44,624
How is this restaurant objectively? 

1695
01:08:45,691 --> 01:08:46,957
Don't make me talk right now. 

1696
01:08:46,957 --> 01:08:48,491
He said, "Don't make me talk." 

1697
01:08:49,891 --> 01:08:50,991
This is the last. 

1698
01:08:50,991 --> 01:08:52,291
(He takes the last sip) 

1699
01:08:52,291 --> 01:08:54,091
- Put it on your head. / - Goodness. 

1700
01:08:54,091 --> 01:08:55,091
(Just like Sikyung did) 

1701
01:08:55,557 --> 01:08:58,591
(He takes the last sip) 

1702
01:08:59,057 --> 01:09:01,091
The soup... 

1703
01:09:01,524 --> 01:09:02,124
He finished to the last drop. 

1704
01:09:02,124 --> 01:09:03,824
After I finished it... 

1705
01:09:04,691 --> 01:09:06,457
- "Gratitude" was written on it. / - It does. 

1706
01:09:06,457 --> 01:09:09,624
You can only see that if you eat everything. 

1707
01:09:09,624 --> 01:09:11,891
- It's not salty. / - No. 

1708
01:09:11,891 --> 01:09:14,957
- This is different. / - Yes. 

1709
01:09:14,957 --> 01:09:16,724
It's different from other ramen. 

1710
01:09:16,724 --> 01:09:18,791
Stop showing us. What is this? 

1711
01:09:19,224 --> 01:09:21,857
I'm having a hard time because I'm drooling. 

1712
01:09:21,857 --> 01:09:23,457
(It's as if his salivary gland is broken) 

1713
01:09:23,457 --> 01:09:25,557
The Man Man Tour is really something. 

1714
01:09:25,557 --> 01:09:26,891
It's a culinary tour. 

1715
01:09:27,957 --> 01:09:30,224
That was great. Thanks to you, I had a great ramen. 

1716
01:09:30,224 --> 01:09:32,624
- Thank you. / - Thank you. 

1717
01:09:33,024 --> 01:09:34,957
- See? The sign looks delicious. / - Does it? 

1718
01:09:34,957 --> 01:09:36,257
- The sign looks tasty. / - Yes, the sign does. 

1719
01:09:36,257 --> 01:09:38,691
How do you know just by looking at the sign? 

1720
01:09:38,691 --> 01:09:41,391
- Alright. / - Before we go back to the hotel... 

1721
01:09:41,391 --> 01:09:44,957
Since we ate a lot, 

1722
01:09:44,957 --> 01:09:47,391
shall we take a walk? 

1723
01:09:47,724 --> 01:09:50,224
- What do you think? / - Are we going for a walk? 

1724
01:09:51,124 --> 01:09:52,724
Are we going to one more place? 

1725
01:09:53,424 --> 01:09:55,991
Well, you know... 

1726
01:09:55,991 --> 01:09:57,924
You're acting really suspicious. 

1727
01:09:57,924 --> 01:10:00,091
- It's a surprise. / - She got you. 

1728
01:10:00,091 --> 01:10:02,391
- She noticed. / - Goodness. 

1729
01:10:02,391 --> 01:10:04,791
- I guess he hasn't done it a lot. / - He's unskilled. 

1730
01:10:04,791 --> 01:10:08,791
(Toward the end of their Hokkaido trip) 

1731
01:10:11,991 --> 01:10:16,957
(The final destination of this trip is Asahikawa River) 

1732
01:10:20,257 --> 01:10:22,024
Where is this? It looks so nice. 

1733
01:10:22,024 --> 01:10:24,357
We're at a riverside where you can see 

1734
01:10:24,357 --> 01:10:26,157
the Asahikawa bridge, which represents the area. 

1735
01:10:30,924 --> 01:10:32,057
(It's a quiet parking lot where they can be alone) 

1736
01:10:32,057 --> 01:10:33,557
- Riverside. / - It's so... 

1737
01:10:35,957 --> 01:10:38,591
- It's wide open. / - It's nice. 

1738
01:10:38,591 --> 01:10:40,591
Exactly. It's... 

1739
01:10:40,591 --> 01:10:42,757
If the weather was nice, 

1740
01:10:42,757 --> 01:10:44,757
I was going to take you to a place 

1741
01:10:44,757 --> 01:10:46,324
where we can see the stars. 

1742
01:10:46,791 --> 01:10:49,391
- But it rained today. / - I see. 

1743
01:10:49,957 --> 01:10:52,791
- Why see the stars so suddenly? / - Well, you know. 

1744
01:10:52,791 --> 01:10:55,091
Hyungkyu prepared something. Goodness. 

1745
01:10:55,091 --> 01:10:57,624
- This reminds me of the Hangang. / - Exactly. 

1746
01:10:58,091 --> 01:11:01,291
- We had dates there. / - We did. 

1747
01:11:02,091 --> 01:11:06,257
- At night, after my radio show... / - It wasn't the radio. 

1748
01:11:06,824 --> 01:11:08,991
- After the show... / - Yes. 

1749
01:11:08,991 --> 01:11:11,191
- We'd meet at Hangang. / - Yes, we did. 

1750
01:11:11,191 --> 01:11:13,257
- Then go home. / - We did. 

1751
01:11:13,257 --> 01:11:15,324
- So about that... / - Yes. 

1752
01:11:15,324 --> 01:11:17,424
Why isn't he giving her the gift? 

1753
01:11:19,591 --> 01:11:22,557
(Hyungkyu opens the trunk carefully) 

1754
01:11:23,524 --> 01:11:25,391
(Goodness) 

1755
01:11:26,624 --> 01:11:28,457
- He prepared something. / - No. 

1756
01:11:28,457 --> 01:11:29,657
Awesome. 

1757
01:11:29,657 --> 01:11:30,891
What is it? 

1758
01:11:32,957 --> 01:11:35,391
Ta-da. 

1759
01:11:35,391 --> 01:11:38,024
(Her eyes are wide open) 

1760
01:11:38,357 --> 01:11:41,091
- What's this? / - This is... 

1761
01:11:41,757 --> 01:11:42,757
(Hyungkyu turns the light on) 

1762
01:11:42,757 --> 01:11:44,457
- Gosh. / - What is it? 

1763
01:11:44,457 --> 01:11:46,257
He prepared something cute. 

1764
01:11:47,257 --> 01:11:48,657
(The trunk is full of their memories) 

1765
01:11:48,657 --> 01:11:50,957
- When did you prepare this? / - Pictures? 

1766
01:11:51,724 --> 01:11:54,657
I printed some pictures. 

1767
01:11:55,657 --> 01:11:56,924
That's fantastic. 

1768
01:11:57,624 --> 01:12:04,157
(Their memories from their old trips) 

1769
01:12:04,157 --> 01:12:10,457
(And the new memories from this trip) 

1770
01:12:12,357 --> 01:12:13,724
Thank you. 

1771
01:12:13,724 --> 01:12:14,791
(Before they departed from the ramen place) 

1772
01:12:14,791 --> 01:12:17,757
- I'll go use the bathroom. / - Okay. 

1773
01:12:18,424 --> 01:12:20,157
(While she's waiting for Hyungkyu) 

1774
01:12:20,157 --> 01:12:21,391
You did it then. 

1775
01:12:21,691 --> 01:12:22,824
I have to decorate. 

1776
01:12:22,824 --> 01:12:23,991
(He prepared a small event) 

1777
01:12:23,991 --> 01:12:25,791
She didn't know that was in the car? 

1778
01:12:25,791 --> 01:12:27,524
She didn't know because it was in the back. 

1779
01:12:27,524 --> 01:12:29,024
You wouldn't look there. 

1780
01:12:31,157 --> 01:12:32,424
Gosh, he's taking it again. 

1781
01:12:32,424 --> 01:12:34,291
He loves taking photos. 

1782
01:12:34,291 --> 01:12:35,857
- He loves taking pictures. / - Yes. 

1783
01:12:35,857 --> 01:12:37,191
What should I do? 

1784
01:12:37,191 --> 01:12:39,757
- What do we do? Here? / - Let's go in. 

1785
01:12:40,124 --> 01:12:42,424
- Should I take my shoes off? / - No, keep them on. 

1786
01:12:42,424 --> 01:12:46,257
- Go in like this. / - I'm so touched. 

1787
01:12:48,591 --> 01:12:51,557
- It's like they're playing house. / - But she likes it. 

1788
01:12:52,124 --> 01:12:53,257
(Yuna claps because she's embarrassed) 

1789
01:12:53,257 --> 01:12:55,524
- What do you think? Isn't this fun? / - It's so cozy. 

1790
01:12:55,524 --> 01:12:57,391
- It's a lot of fun. / - I feel like a kid. 

1791
01:12:58,124 --> 01:13:02,424
We don't like surprises. 

1792
01:13:02,424 --> 01:13:05,091
So even on our wedding anniversary... 

1793
01:13:07,557 --> 01:13:08,924
We just go out to eat. 

1794
01:13:09,691 --> 01:13:11,424
That's what we normally do. 

1795
01:13:11,991 --> 01:13:14,724
Thinking that he put up all the pictures 

1796
01:13:14,724 --> 01:13:16,624
and lights... 

1797
01:13:16,891 --> 01:13:18,491
I found him really cute. 

1798
01:13:20,824 --> 01:13:22,657
- Awesome, right? / - Look at this. 

1799
01:13:22,891 --> 01:13:24,991
What's this picture? 

1800
01:13:24,991 --> 01:13:28,524
These are our old pictures. 

1801
01:13:29,357 --> 01:13:30,891
These are... 

1802
01:13:30,891 --> 01:13:33,391
- From this trip. / - This is from yesterday. 

1803
01:13:33,391 --> 01:13:37,157
- This is Sapporo. / - Yes. 

1804
01:13:37,291 --> 01:13:40,024
Goodness. This is Sapporo. 

1805
01:13:40,024 --> 01:13:41,591
It's nice to have the old and the new pictures 

1806
01:13:41,591 --> 01:13:43,057
together. 

1807
01:13:43,057 --> 01:13:45,657
- Yes. That's very pretty. / - That's early 2007. 

1808
01:13:45,657 --> 01:13:48,324
- Early 2007. / - We went on a trip... 

1809
01:13:48,324 --> 01:13:50,757
- With our parents. / - Right. 

1810
01:13:50,757 --> 01:13:53,357
- That's why we went there... / - This one. 

1811
01:13:53,757 --> 01:13:56,491
- Yesterday. / - That's why we took this. 

1812
01:13:56,491 --> 01:13:58,924
- Here. / - It's fun. 

1813
01:13:58,957 --> 01:14:03,124
Even though we don't have the same composition... 

1814
01:14:03,124 --> 01:14:04,857
- But it feels the same. / - It's nice. 

1815
01:14:04,857 --> 01:14:06,757
Yes, that's nice. 

1816
01:14:06,757 --> 01:14:08,757
You can go back on your 20th anniversary. 

1817
01:14:08,757 --> 01:14:11,091
- Yes. / - That's right. 

1818
01:14:11,724 --> 01:14:14,757
Like I mentioned before... 

1819
01:14:15,691 --> 01:14:18,291
This trip was so great... 

1820
01:14:18,824 --> 01:14:22,024
And also it was a different experience. 

1821
01:14:22,824 --> 01:14:27,924
I thought it was weird because 

1822
01:14:27,924 --> 01:14:30,557
we haven't been on a trip together... 

1823
01:14:31,291 --> 01:14:32,991
- In over 10 years. / - Over 10 years. 

1824
01:14:32,991 --> 01:14:35,791
This was the first time... 

1825
01:14:35,791 --> 01:14:37,524
- After Minjae was born. / - Right. 

1826
01:14:37,524 --> 01:14:40,424
We drove and talked 

1827
01:14:40,424 --> 01:14:44,057
for an hour and a half to two hours. 

1828
01:14:45,257 --> 01:14:49,724
I think this trip will be... 

1829
01:14:49,724 --> 01:14:52,591
- A very memorable one. / - Right. 

1830
01:14:52,591 --> 01:14:55,491
From now on, Man Man Tour... 

1831
01:14:55,491 --> 01:14:57,957
Yes, Man Man Tour. Can we do this often? 

1832
01:14:57,957 --> 01:15:00,391
Yes. For all our lives. 

1833
01:15:00,391 --> 01:15:02,557
- That's good. / - We'll do it. 

1834
01:15:02,557 --> 01:15:05,324
- Let's do well. Let's go. / - Let's do it. 

1835
01:15:06,191 --> 01:15:10,191
(A trip with a partner like a friend and like a lover) 

1836
01:15:13,924 --> 01:15:15,524
I realized again that 

1837
01:15:15,524 --> 01:15:18,557
there is a match made in heaven. 

1838
01:15:18,557 --> 01:15:20,491
Because you two share jokes, 

1839
01:15:20,491 --> 01:15:23,291
you have the same sense of humor, 

1840
01:15:23,291 --> 01:15:24,691
and that looks so great. 

1841
01:15:24,691 --> 01:15:26,791
- I want to ask you something. / - They're all married... 

1842
01:15:26,791 --> 01:15:28,257
Except us two. 

1843
01:15:28,257 --> 01:15:29,791
- You're right. / - You two should get married. 

1844
01:15:29,791 --> 01:15:32,124
- Get married. / - You can marry each other. 

1845
01:15:32,391 --> 01:15:34,791
(Don't look far for your fate) 

1846
01:15:34,791 --> 01:15:37,724
- Goodness. / - I became a bit envious. 

1847
01:15:37,724 --> 01:15:39,257
- I'm a little jealous. / - Yes. 

1848
01:15:39,257 --> 01:15:41,524
- You look good together. / - We'll have you get married... 

1849
01:15:41,524 --> 01:15:43,757
As we end this show. 

1850
01:15:44,191 --> 01:15:47,557
Actually, I didn't feel jealous last week. 

1851
01:15:47,557 --> 01:15:49,357
But I feel jealous this week. 

1852
01:15:49,357 --> 01:15:52,191
You must've felt really great about Hokkaido. 

1853
01:15:52,191 --> 01:15:55,224
- Because it's been 12 years. / - Yes, it did. 

1854
01:15:55,491 --> 01:15:59,057
This place is really great for couples 

1855
01:15:59,057 --> 01:16:01,924
because it is an area with vast nature. 

1856
01:16:01,924 --> 01:16:06,424
Standing before nature, humans seem very small. 

1857
01:16:06,424 --> 01:16:08,224
Though we are small, 

1858
01:16:08,224 --> 01:16:10,724
when we're with our partners and family, 

1859
01:16:10,724 --> 01:16:13,724
we can rely on each other. We can realize that. 

1860
01:16:13,724 --> 01:16:16,324
So I think it's a great destination for married couples. 

1861
01:16:16,324 --> 01:16:20,191
You can taste delicious food and you can relax. 

1862
01:16:20,424 --> 01:16:21,757
- I highly recommend it. / - Yes. 

1863
01:16:21,757 --> 01:16:23,791
Hyungkyu, you married a great woman. 

1864
01:16:23,791 --> 01:16:26,091
When you were taking a selfie, 

1865
01:16:26,091 --> 01:16:28,157
she left without taking one for you. 

1866
01:16:28,157 --> 01:16:29,557
Weren't you angry? 

1867
01:16:29,557 --> 01:16:32,257
No. Because... 

1868
01:16:32,591 --> 01:16:34,991
That happens so often. 

1869
01:16:34,991 --> 01:16:37,291
- He's used to it. / - Yes. 

1870
01:16:37,624 --> 01:16:39,357
He took a selfie after 

1871
01:16:39,357 --> 01:16:41,391
getting the surprise ready for his wife. 

1872
01:16:41,391 --> 01:16:42,857
The look on his face. 

1873

After 5 years, she's going to say, "I don't believe this." 

1874
01:16:46,424 --> 01:16:48,391
- No, she'll understand. / - I don't believe this. 

1875
01:16:48,391 --> 01:16:50,391
Let's check out the cost. 

1876
01:16:50,391 --> 01:16:51,157
This is what we want to know. 

1877

Hyungkyu, how much was it?

For 2 nights and 3 days in Hokkaido, 

1881
01:16:57,757 --> 01:16:59,524
the Man Man Tour spent... 

1882
01:16:59,524 --> 01:17:01,957
- A total amount of... / - Total amount.

1884

$313. 

1885
01:17:06,691 --> 01:17:09,091
- That's similar. / - $313. 

1886
01:17:09,091 --> 01:17:10,724
- That's less than we thought. / - It's not as expensive. 

1887
01:17:10,724 --> 01:17:13,291
- That's right. / - You even rented a car. 

1888
01:17:13,291 --> 01:17:17,224
- We spent only on food. / - Right. 

1889
01:17:17,224 --> 01:17:20,124
We spent money on nothing else. 

1890
01:17:20,124 --> 01:17:22,224
- That's right. / - We looked at nature. 

1891
01:17:22,224 --> 01:17:25,857
A couple of 30 years received luxury spa treatment. 

1892
01:17:25,857 --> 01:17:27,957
- That's what they did. / - Yes. And the snap tour. 

1893
01:17:27,957 --> 01:17:30,391
But this couple is younger and they were economical, 

1894
01:17:30,391 --> 01:17:32,157
so they saved money. 

1895
01:17:32,157 --> 01:17:34,491
Alright. Please stand up and say your last words.

Sook, why don't we... 

1897
01:17:37,291 --> 01:17:39,591
- Open our eyes together? 1, 2, 3. / - What? 

1898
01:17:39,591 --> 01:17:41,491
(Scary) 

1899
01:17:41,491 --> 01:17:43,491
- There. / - They look the same. 

1900
01:17:43,491 --> 01:17:46,791
- That was great. / - Hokkaido will make your eyes... 

1901

Pop with its food and nature.

1905
01:17:56,624 --> 01:17:59,057

It's the same first digit.

Why am I nervous? 

1921
01:18:36,891 --> 01:18:37,557

But you didn't do anything special. 

1942
