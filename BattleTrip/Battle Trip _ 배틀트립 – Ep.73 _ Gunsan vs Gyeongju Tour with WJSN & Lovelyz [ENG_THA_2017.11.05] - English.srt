(Numerous great tips on trips)

00:00:03,609 --> 00:00:04,776
(Lee Hwijae, Son Dongwun of Highlight)

3
00:00:05,576 --> 00:00:06,943
(Kim Sook, Sung Sikyung)

4
00:00:06,943 --> 00:00:08,009
Travel is war.

5
00:00:08,009 --> 00:00:10,109
Battle Trip!

6
00:00:12,676 --> 00:00:13,943
It's nice to see you all.

7
00:00:13,943 --> 00:00:18,243
Today's special host is Son Dongwun of Highlight!

8
00:00:18,243 --> 00:00:20,309
Hello, I'm Dongwun.

9
00:00:20,309 --> 00:00:21,676
I'm so happy to be here today.

10
00:00:21,676 --> 00:00:24,243
Doesn't he look a bit different today?

11
00:00:24,243 --> 00:00:25,343
Do I look slimmer?

12
00:00:25,343 --> 00:00:28,009
- Did you go on a diet? / - Yes, we're returning soon.

13
00:00:30,243 --> 00:00:32,409
Dongwun, you've been on the show

14
00:00:32,409 --> 00:00:33,743
as a trip designer, haven't you?

15
00:00:33,743 --> 00:00:35,476
- He has. / - I went to Laos...

16
00:00:35,476 --> 00:00:37,709
- With Dujun in May. / - You went with Dujun.

17
00:00:37,709 --> 00:00:39,709
The concept was the trip of the youth.

18
00:00:39,709 --> 00:00:41,576
The opposing team was Kim Suyong...

19
00:00:41,576 --> 00:00:43,576
- And Park Hwisun. / - Yes, that's right.

20
00:00:43,576 --> 00:00:46,243
It was great. Not many people knew Laos...

21
00:00:46,243 --> 00:00:48,376
- But they were great guides. / - Right.

22
00:00:48,376 --> 00:00:50,843
If I can, I'd like to go again.

23
00:00:50,843 --> 00:00:53,209
- You're on my team today. / - I know.

24
00:00:53,209 --> 00:00:55,909
It's always 1 vs. 2 for me.

25
00:00:55,909 --> 00:00:57,543
Because I always pair up with the special host.

26
00:00:57,543 --> 00:00:59,209
So it's always been a 1 on 2 battle.

27
00:00:59,209 --> 00:01:02,309
The truth is that after I passed the age of 45...

28
00:01:02,309 --> 00:01:05,543
- My testosterone level has dropped. / - That's true.

29
00:01:05,543 --> 00:01:06,809
- So my desire to win... / - It's gone?

30
00:01:06,809 --> 00:01:09,109
- It's because... / - I hear you lose your ambition.

31
00:01:09,109 --> 00:01:10,409
That's true.

32
00:01:10,409 --> 00:01:12,143
Instead of winning the battle on the show,

33
00:01:12,143 --> 00:01:14,143
I think that I should hurry home and watch a drama.

34
00:01:15,109 --> 00:01:17,009
But after I stopped wanting to win,

35
00:01:17,009 --> 00:01:19,309
strangely, my team has never lost since August.

36
00:01:19,309 --> 00:01:20,109
What happened?

37
00:01:20,109 --> 00:01:21,909
We used to have a high rate of winning.

38
00:01:21,909 --> 00:01:24,543
- Sikyung. / - I haven't reached 40 yet.

39
00:01:24,543 --> 00:01:26,309
My desires have gone down as well.

40
00:01:28,176 --> 00:01:30,343
- Fall is good for ballad songs. / - That's right.

41
00:01:30,343 --> 00:01:32,909
- So the luck should be on our side. / - Of course.

42
00:01:32,909 --> 00:01:35,109
- So we might win today. / - It's your season.

43
00:01:35,109 --> 00:01:37,543
I'll root for Sikyung today.

44
00:01:37,543 --> 00:01:38,676
We should meet our client today.

45
00:01:38,676 --> 00:01:40,609
We have a special client today. Let's meet the client.

46
00:01:41,343 --> 00:01:43,009
Hi, I'm Emma.

47
00:01:43,009 --> 00:01:44,309
I'm an exchange student...

48
00:01:44,309 --> 00:01:46,143
- From Mexico. / - Mexico?

49
00:01:46,143 --> 00:01:48,843
I think Korea is a beautiful place...

50
00:01:48,843 --> 00:01:51,343
- To travel in the fall. / - Right on.

51
00:01:51,343 --> 00:01:54,776
I'd like to travel to one of the best places...

52
00:01:54,776 --> 00:01:57,709
In Gunsan or Gyeongju.

53
00:01:57,709 --> 00:01:59,076
- She already picked the cities? / - And...

54
00:01:59,076 --> 00:02:02,109
I cannot decide where to go.

55
00:02:02,109 --> 00:02:05,276
Can you please plan a trip for me?

56
00:02:05,276 --> 00:02:08,309
Either to Gunsan or Gyeongju?

57
00:02:09,343 --> 00:02:11,209
The places have already been decided.

58
00:02:11,209 --> 00:02:12,476
- Gunsan vs. Gyeongju. / - Gunsan vs. Gyeongju.

59
00:02:12,476 --> 00:02:14,209
Foreigners may find...

60
00:02:14,209 --> 00:02:16,143
- Gyeongju to be more charming. / - Right.

61
00:02:16,143 --> 00:02:18,509
It used to be the old capital.

62
00:02:18,509 --> 00:02:19,176
They could be curious.

63
00:02:19,176 --> 00:02:22,509
- What about food? / - But food in Gunsan is...

64
00:02:22,509 --> 00:02:24,276
- Unbeatable. / - Goodness, that's right.

65
00:02:24,276 --> 00:02:27,309
The trip designers for today

66
00:02:27,309 --> 00:02:28,809
are truly amazing.

67
00:02:28,809 --> 00:02:31,076
That's why we have a lot of guys in the audience.

68
00:02:31,076 --> 00:02:32,609
- Right. It's a bit odd today. / - That's so true.

69
00:02:32,609 --> 00:02:35,076
- Sound director... / - This has never happened.

70
00:02:35,076 --> 00:02:38,643
You don't need to raise the volume. It'll be real loud.

71
00:02:38,643 --> 00:02:41,343
Our four trip designers, please come on out!

72
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:47,143
(Sujeong and Yein of Lovelyz)

73
00:02:48,143 --> 00:02:49,709
(Eunseo and Cheng Xiao of WJSN)

74
00:02:53,243 --> 00:02:54,309
Good, good.

75
00:02:54,309 --> 00:02:57,609
- These two teams are smiling. / - Yes, they are.

76
00:02:57,609 --> 00:02:59,476
But I bet they are feeling competitive inside.

77
00:02:59,476 --> 00:03:02,109
I bet. Which team has seniority?

78
00:03:02,109 --> 00:03:02,876
Is there such a thing?

79
00:03:02,876 --> 00:03:06,309
We made our debut in the winter of 2014.

80
00:03:06,309 --> 00:03:08,076
- So we debuted earlier than they did. / - Goodness.

81
00:03:09,543 --> 00:03:10,676
How much earlier was your debut?

82
00:03:10,676 --> 00:03:12,376
- How many months? / - When was your debut?

83
00:03:12,376 --> 00:03:13,709
- Ours was in 2016. / - It was in 2016.

84
00:03:13,709 --> 00:03:17,443
Goodness, we are seniors!

85
00:03:19,243 --> 00:03:22,209
- We are their seniors. / - 2 years.

86
00:03:22,209 --> 00:03:25,343
Can you tell us where you went?

87
00:03:25,343 --> 00:03:26,076
WJSN, why don't you start?

88
00:03:26,076 --> 00:03:29,143
We went to Gunsan where the modern history

89
00:03:29,143 --> 00:03:30,743
of Korea is alive.

90
00:03:32,843 --> 00:03:35,809
We went to Gyeongju, the city 400,000 tourists

91
00:03:35,809 --> 00:03:38,309
visited during the golden holidays.

92
00:03:39,576 --> 00:03:41,976
- Gyeongju. / - Before we see the clips...

93
00:03:41,976 --> 00:03:44,409
We'll go over the food from the trips.

94
00:03:44,409 --> 00:03:46,409
The food you ate...

95
00:03:46,409 --> 00:03:47,943
We stress importance on food here.

96
00:03:47,943 --> 00:03:49,943
Can you tell us a dish from the region?

97
00:03:49,943 --> 00:03:53,376
The dish you must taste in Gunsan is...

98
00:03:53,676 --> 00:03:54,743
- The beef ribs! / - The beef ribs!

99
00:03:54,743 --> 00:03:56,409
- Beef ribs. / - Beef ribs.

100
00:03:57,576 --> 00:03:59,376
Our dish is also beef ribs.

101
00:03:59,376 --> 00:04:01,309
- Gyeongju ribs? / - Yes, we had beef ribs.

102
00:04:01,309 --> 00:04:03,076
- What kind of beef ribs? / - On top of the beef ribs...

103
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:04,676
There's a trail of snow.

104
00:04:04,676 --> 00:04:05,709
The dish is...

105
00:04:05,709 --> 00:04:08,009
Steamed beef ribs with rice cake.

106
00:04:08,009 --> 00:04:10,076
Steamed beef ribs.

107
00:04:10,076 --> 00:04:12,109
They sprinkled white MSG?

108
00:04:12,109 --> 00:04:13,343
- No. / - Or is it the oil?

109
00:04:13,343 --> 00:04:14,743
- No. / - Is it salt?

110
00:04:14,743 --> 00:04:15,809
- No. / - Oil from the beef.

111
00:04:15,809 --> 00:04:17,743
Beef fat is really bad for you.

112
00:04:17,743 --> 00:04:18,576
It's not that?

113
00:04:18,576 --> 00:04:21,409
Once you see the clip, you will change your mind.

114
00:04:21,409 --> 00:04:23,843
Grilled beef ribs vs. steamed beef ribs.

115
00:04:23,843 --> 00:04:25,876
The latter costs more.

116
00:04:25,876 --> 00:04:28,609
And today's battle will be a good one.

117
00:04:28,609 --> 00:04:31,376
After watching the show, viewers can leave tomorrow.

118
00:04:31,376 --> 00:04:33,143
- If they like the trip. / - They can go right away.

119
00:04:33,143 --> 00:04:35,676
- They can even go during the show. / - Exactly.

120
00:04:35,676 --> 00:04:37,143
I'm sure today's show will be interesting.

121
00:04:37,143 --> 00:04:40,176
We have our 100 objective judges with us

122
00:04:40,176 --> 00:04:41,943
in the audience.

123
00:04:41,943 --> 00:04:43,476
- Nice to meet you. / - Welcome.

124
00:04:45,443 --> 00:04:47,443
Today, it's a 1 round victory.

125
00:04:47,443 --> 00:04:49,976
The team with more votes will

126
00:04:49,976 --> 00:04:51,676
win the battle.

127
00:04:51,676 --> 00:04:52,976
- Nice and easy. / - Which team should go first?

128
00:04:52,976 --> 00:04:54,209
Should we start with our team?

129
00:04:54,209 --> 00:04:55,443
- Gunsan? / - We're confident today.

130
00:04:55,443 --> 00:04:56,609
- We're confident about the trip. / - Why is that?

131
00:04:56,609 --> 00:04:59,376
The client today was a foreigner.

132
00:04:59,376 --> 00:05:02,843
- It takes one to understand one. / - True.

133
00:05:02,843 --> 00:05:04,309
Don't you think that Gunsan has the upper hand?

134
00:05:04,309 --> 00:05:06,076
Without knowing Gyeongju

135
00:05:06,076 --> 00:05:07,476
and only having been to Gunsan,

136
00:05:07,476 --> 00:05:09,309
do you think your trip can win?

137
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:11,676
Well, we really enjoyed our trip.

138
00:05:11,676 --> 00:05:13,843
So we are confident that we can win.

139
00:05:15,309 --> 00:05:17,443
What do you think? Do you think you can beat them?

140
00:05:17,443 --> 00:05:18,276
- Of course. / - Of course.

141
00:05:19,109 --> 00:05:21,743
Putting aside our desire to win...

142
00:05:21,743 --> 00:05:23,576
- You just need to enjoy it. / - We had so much fun.

143
00:05:23,576 --> 00:05:25,843
All you need from the trip is that you enjoyed it

144
00:05:25,843 --> 00:05:26,743
and ate good food.

145
00:05:26,743 --> 00:05:29,076
- The food was great. / - That's all you need.

146
00:05:29,076 --> 00:05:32,009
Alright then. Let's take a look at the trip for Gunsan.

147
00:05:35,509 --> 00:05:37,543
Is there a place you want to visit?

148
00:05:37,543 --> 00:05:39,709
I... Wait. Look at this.

149
00:05:39,709 --> 00:05:41,709
Isn't this amazing?

150
00:05:42,143 --> 00:05:43,909
There are many places we can go.

151
00:05:43,909 --> 00:05:45,176
That's pretty.

152
00:05:45,176 --> 00:05:46,376
There's a lot to see.

153
00:05:48,843 --> 00:05:50,076
Eunpa.

154
00:05:50,076 --> 00:05:52,009
They're at the age when they find everything funny.

155
00:05:52,009 --> 00:05:53,476
This was your first individual trip, right?

156
00:05:53,476 --> 00:05:54,943
- First time by ourselves. / - First time just us two.

157
00:05:54,943 --> 00:05:56,409
How exciting must it have been?

158
00:05:56,409 --> 00:05:57,843
1, 2, 3. Would you like?

159
00:05:57,843 --> 00:06:00,209
Hello, we are WJSN.

160
00:06:00,609 --> 00:06:01,909
- Eunseo / - And Cheng Xiao.

161
00:06:01,909 --> 00:06:03,209
Hello.

162
00:06:04,709 --> 00:06:07,243
(WJSN is a girl group with 13 members)

163
00:06:07,676 --> 00:06:10,076
So much serviced goods.

164
00:06:10,076 --> 00:06:12,609
I could live in Gunsan.

165
00:06:12,676 --> 00:06:14,609
(Cheng Xiao, beginner traveler)

166
00:06:16,243 --> 00:06:19,843
- They eat a lot. I like it. / - That looks tasty.

167
00:06:19,843 --> 00:06:20,743
Great stuff.

168
00:06:22,409 --> 00:06:23,476
This time,

169
00:06:23,476 --> 00:06:26,009
we have a request from a foreigner.

170
00:06:26,009 --> 00:06:29,109
So we thought a lot about where to go.

171
00:06:29,109 --> 00:06:31,409
Since Cheng Xiao is a foreigner too...

172
00:06:31,409 --> 00:06:32,776
- Oh, that's right. / - She chose...

173
00:06:32,776 --> 00:06:34,376
Which part of China are you from, Cheng Xiao?

174
00:06:34,376 --> 00:06:36,309
I'm from Shenzhen.

175
00:06:36,309 --> 00:06:38,443
- Is that close to Hong Kong? / - Next to Hong Kong.

176
00:06:38,443 --> 00:06:40,176
- That's right. / - Cheng Xiao chose...

177
00:06:40,176 --> 00:06:43,209
- Jeolla-do... / - Gunsan!

178
00:06:45,043 --> 00:06:48,143
Our member, Bona, is

179
00:06:48,143 --> 00:06:51,443
shooting a drama in Gunsan right now.

180
00:06:51,809 --> 00:06:54,643
She told me that Gunsan was great.

181
00:06:54,643 --> 00:06:55,909
So I'd like to visit too.

182
00:06:55,909 --> 00:06:57,476
- Is that why you chose it? / - That's why I chose it.

183
00:06:57,476 --> 00:07:00,276
You did? It'd be her first trip in Korea.

184
00:07:00,276 --> 00:07:01,276
That's right.

185
00:07:01,276 --> 00:07:03,776
- So I'm really looking forward to it. / - You are?

186
00:07:04,943 --> 00:07:07,409
I want to have a lot of fun.

187
00:07:07,409 --> 00:07:09,509
I want our trip to be meaningful with a lot of activities.

188
00:07:09,509 --> 00:07:13,243
First of all, people browse through the social media...

189
00:07:13,243 --> 00:07:15,376
- To come up with the itinerary. / - That's true.

190
00:07:15,376 --> 00:07:17,909
So we're thinking of taking a look at some spots

191
00:07:17,909 --> 00:07:20,243
on social media.

192
00:07:20,243 --> 00:07:26,043
And choose places that have a lot of likes.

193
00:07:26,043 --> 00:07:27,276
The number of likes...

194
00:07:29,909 --> 00:07:32,676
Well... How about 10,000 likes?

195
00:07:38,009 --> 00:07:40,609
- 10,000 likes! / - That's cute.

196
00:07:40,609 --> 00:07:41,743
She doesn't look pleased.

197
00:07:41,743 --> 00:07:43,576
That's your angry face, right?

198
00:07:45,509 --> 00:07:48,909
Starting now, our goal is receiving 10,000 likes.

199
00:07:48,909 --> 00:07:52,076
- I'll plan a clever course. / - That's right.

200
00:07:52,076 --> 00:07:53,743
- Name of our tour? / - Name of our tour?

201
00:07:53,743 --> 00:07:57,476
- We thought about it a lot. / - We did.

202
00:07:57,476 --> 00:08:00,676
We thought about combining our

203
00:08:00,676 --> 00:08:02,943
song titles with Gunsan.

204
00:08:02,943 --> 00:08:06,409
With "Mo Mo Mo," it becomes Gunsan Mo Mo Mo.

205
00:08:06,409 --> 00:08:09,143
With "Secret," it becomes It's Gunsan.

206
00:08:09,809 --> 00:08:14,209
Our wish is to spread joy in Gunsan.

207
00:08:14,543 --> 00:08:16,009
So we went with I Wish Gunsan.

208
00:08:16,009 --> 00:08:17,276
That's what we settled with.

209
00:08:17,276 --> 00:08:20,276
- Everyone, this is Cheng Xiao's... / - And Eunseo's...

210
00:08:20,276 --> 00:08:22,576
I Wish Gunsan!

211
00:08:22,576 --> 00:08:24,843
- Like our trip! / - Give us 10,000 likes!

212
00:08:24,843 --> 00:08:26,243
10,000 likes!

213
00:08:27,543 --> 00:08:29,609
- That's so pretty. / - What is it?

214
00:08:29,609 --> 00:08:31,043
- Isn't that pretty? / - It is.

215
00:08:31,043 --> 00:08:34,076
We'll do our best to get 10,000 likes.

216
00:08:34,076 --> 00:08:36,309
This looks really pretty.

217
00:08:37,809 --> 00:08:38,709
That must be it!

218
00:08:40,609 --> 00:08:41,576
Gosh, that looks really tasty.

219
00:08:41,576 --> 00:08:43,543
I Wish Gunsan!

220
00:08:43,543 --> 00:08:45,743
Bye!

221
00:08:45,743 --> 00:08:47,376
I wish for good things from Gunsan.

222
00:08:47,376 --> 00:08:49,276
- Seeing it from here... / - So pretty.

223
00:08:49,276 --> 00:08:51,576
It's beautiful indeed.

224
00:08:51,576 --> 00:08:53,643
- There were so many things to see. / - Korea is great.

225
00:08:53,643 --> 00:08:56,743
(Heated floor train)

226
00:08:56,743 --> 00:08:58,209
1, 2, 3, 4.

227
00:09:01,909 --> 00:09:06,276
Hello, we are I Wish Gunsan.

228
00:09:06,276 --> 00:09:08,343
You wore matching shirts.

229
00:09:08,343 --> 00:09:09,776
Wait, are they matching dresses?

230
00:09:09,776 --> 00:09:11,743
- It's our twin look. / - They are dresses.

231
00:09:11,743 --> 00:09:13,709
Cheng Xiao, where are we going today?

232
00:09:13,709 --> 00:09:16,043
- It's Gunsan, right? / - That's correct.

233
00:09:16,043 --> 00:09:17,409
You're right.

234
00:09:17,409 --> 00:09:19,909
We're heading to Gunsan!

235
00:09:24,209 --> 00:09:26,376
Even though they're working, they're still traveling.

236
00:09:26,376 --> 00:09:28,843
Even though they're traveling, it's still work.

237
00:09:28,843 --> 00:09:30,509
- That must've been fun for them. / - I agree.

238
00:09:30,509 --> 00:09:32,843
- I was really excited. / - They can just eat and sleep.

239
00:09:32,843 --> 00:09:35,376
- Where is it? / - West Gold Train.

240
00:09:35,376 --> 00:09:37,209
- It really looks gold. / - It's gold.

241
00:09:37,209 --> 00:09:40,309
- You're right. / - The interior was real pretty too.

242
00:09:40,309 --> 00:09:41,309
Goodness.

243
00:09:41,309 --> 00:09:42,709
- Wow. / - Wow.

244
00:09:45,809 --> 00:09:48,109
This the first train in the world

245
00:09:48,109 --> 00:09:49,576
to have the floor heating system.

246
00:09:49,576 --> 00:09:50,943
- What is that? / - What is that?

247
00:09:50,943 --> 00:09:52,476
Isn't that amazing?

248
00:09:52,476 --> 00:09:54,343
- No way. / - That's incredible.

249
00:09:57,643 --> 00:09:59,243
- You can lie down for the trip? / - Yes.

250
00:09:59,243 --> 00:10:01,543
- Let's take that train. / - That's spectacular.

251
00:10:01,543 --> 00:10:02,676
- You can warm your back the entire trip? / - Yes.

252
00:10:02,676 --> 00:10:04,143
- Does it run daily? / - Yes.

253
00:10:04,143 --> 00:10:06,576
- Warm your back... / - It's on.

254
00:10:06,576 --> 00:10:08,276
It's getting warmer already.

255
00:10:08,276 --> 00:10:11,676
- What is this? / - It only runs once a day.

256
00:10:13,076 --> 00:10:14,643
We didn't realize we've departed.

257
00:10:15,543 --> 00:10:17,143
We're leaving.

258
00:10:17,143 --> 00:10:19,509
This is a new feeling I've never felt before.

259
00:10:19,509 --> 00:10:20,943
We didn't even know we were moving.

260
00:10:20,943 --> 00:10:22,843
We're really going on a trip.

261
00:10:22,843 --> 00:10:25,143
Did we leave Seoul just now?

262
00:10:25,443 --> 00:10:27,509
1, 2, 3.

263
00:10:30,676 --> 00:10:32,709
I can't wait.

264
00:10:42,409 --> 00:10:44,076
- You warming your back the entire trip? / - Yes.

265
00:10:45,343 --> 00:10:48,843
The heated floor is relaxing my muscles.

266
00:10:48,843 --> 00:10:50,409
I want to get a massage.

267
00:10:50,409 --> 00:10:53,076
- We like getting massages. / - Exactly.

268
00:10:53,076 --> 00:10:56,109
- This is so comfortable. / - It is.

269
00:10:56,109 --> 00:10:57,643
Then...

270
00:10:57,643 --> 00:11:00,243
When it stops, should we go for the foot bath?

271
00:11:00,243 --> 00:11:01,976
What foot bath?

272
00:11:01,976 --> 00:11:03,509
- You can get it on the train... / - On the train...

273
00:11:03,509 --> 00:11:05,109
- As you enjoy the scenery. / - Really?

274
00:11:05,109 --> 00:11:06,876
- That's amazing. / - It really is.

275
00:11:06,876 --> 00:11:10,809
(Foot bath room ready in the train)

276
00:11:12,443 --> 00:11:15,109
(Wet bath for $8 per 20 minutes, dry for $4)

277
00:11:15,109 --> 00:11:17,109
There are wet and dry foot baths.

278
00:11:24,676 --> 00:11:25,643
- Is this it? / - This is it.

279
00:11:26,909 --> 00:11:28,543
- This is so interesting. / - I want this side.

280
00:11:28,543 --> 00:11:30,643
You're dressed for the foot baths.

281
00:11:30,643 --> 00:11:32,643
- We are. / - That's so intriguing.

282
00:11:32,643 --> 00:11:35,043
- Hello. / - Hello.

283
00:11:35,043 --> 00:11:36,509
Are you here for the foot baths?

284
00:11:36,509 --> 00:11:38,643
- Let me explain this. / - Okay.

285
00:11:38,643 --> 00:11:42,076
The red faucet is for the hot water, and the blue is cold.

286
00:11:42,076 --> 00:11:44,009
You can adjust the temperature yourself.

287
00:11:44,009 --> 00:11:45,309
That's so good.

288
00:11:45,309 --> 00:11:46,743
I'll add the bathing products.

289
00:11:46,743 --> 00:11:47,643
The water...

290
00:11:47,643 --> 00:11:49,376
It'll make it like a thermal spring.

291
00:11:49,376 --> 00:11:52,509
She put in the bath bomb thing.

292
00:11:52,509 --> 00:11:53,776
That smelled really good.

293
00:11:53,776 --> 00:11:54,843
It smells good.

294
00:11:55,676 --> 00:11:56,776
It smells nice.

295
00:11:56,776 --> 00:11:58,876
What kind of water is this?

296
00:11:58,876 --> 00:12:01,176
It's the same as a thermal hot spring.

297
00:12:01,176 --> 00:12:04,109
That's not just tap water. It's thermal spring water.

298
00:12:04,109 --> 00:12:07,743
Your feet will feel better even when you go back home.

299
00:12:09,643 --> 00:12:12,776
I'm going to place hot pads on your shoulders.

300
00:12:12,776 --> 00:12:14,376
This is amazing.

301
00:12:14,376 --> 00:12:15,776
- It might not look like much... / - It's warm.

302
00:12:15,776 --> 00:12:17,776
But when you arrive after that...

303
00:12:17,776 --> 00:12:19,309
- I agree. / - You will feel refreshed.

304
00:12:19,309 --> 00:12:21,343
- You feel less tired. / - Me too.

305
00:12:25,009 --> 00:12:27,176
How come we didn't know about this?

306
00:12:27,176 --> 00:12:28,943
- That train is quite new. / - My first time seeing it.

307
00:12:29,709 --> 00:12:31,909
- I've never seen it before. / - If we upload...

308
00:12:31,909 --> 00:12:34,776
Will we be able to receive 10,000 likes?

309
00:12:34,776 --> 00:12:35,943
We will!

310
00:12:35,943 --> 00:12:38,909
In my opinion, this foot bath is

311
00:12:38,909 --> 00:12:40,943
the cherry on top.

312
00:12:40,943 --> 00:12:43,243
- Viewers. / - This is the best.

313
00:12:43,243 --> 00:12:45,676
We strongly recommend you try this.

314
00:12:45,676 --> 00:12:49,009
Fatigue builds up in anyone's feet.

315
00:12:49,009 --> 00:12:49,943
So I recommend this foot bath.

316
00:12:50,909 --> 00:12:52,876
This is so nice.

317
00:12:52,876 --> 00:12:54,476
It's so relaxing.

318
00:12:54,476 --> 00:12:56,376
Let's go tomorrow.

319
00:12:56,376 --> 00:12:59,209
This view is amazing. I love this.

320
00:12:59,209 --> 00:13:01,209
- The service is great here. / - Yes, it's great here.

321
00:13:07,743 --> 00:13:09,909
- What the? / - Are we really sleeping?

322
00:13:09,909 --> 00:13:11,309
- We're really sleeping. / - Your legs...

323
00:13:11,309 --> 00:13:12,976
- They're sleeping for real. / - When did you film that?

324
00:13:17,276 --> 00:13:22,309
(The girls arrived in Gunsan while they were asleep)

325
00:13:22,309 --> 00:13:26,243
- Everyone! / - We've arrived in Gunsan.

326
00:13:28,709 --> 00:13:30,576
- We're in Gunsan. / - We will...

327
00:13:31,609 --> 00:13:34,943
Go to the railroad village first.

328
00:13:34,943 --> 00:13:36,776
Let's take a picture first.

329
00:13:36,776 --> 00:13:40,043
- That sounds good. / - We're going to take pictures.

330
00:13:40,043 --> 00:13:43,909
And try hard to get 10,000 likes on social media.

331
00:13:43,909 --> 00:13:46,243
- Let's go. / - I don't think they're fully awake.

332
00:13:46,243 --> 00:13:47,976
We were still a little sleepy.

333
00:13:48,876 --> 00:13:49,843
(Heated floor train)

334
00:13:49,843 --> 00:13:50,443
(Verified)

335
00:13:50,909 --> 00:13:53,809
(Gyeongam railroad village)

336
00:13:55,609 --> 00:14:01,176
(The railroad crosses the middle of Gunsan)

337
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:07,276
(Faded walls and old roofs just like the 1970s)

338
00:14:09,143 --> 00:14:10,876
The railroad isn't used anymore.

339
00:14:10,876 --> 00:14:12,876
It's just a tourist spot.

340
00:14:12,876 --> 00:14:14,776
- It's so pretty. / - That's nice.

341
00:14:18,076 --> 00:14:19,609
It's a railroad.

342
00:14:19,609 --> 00:14:21,376
It's written here.

343
00:14:21,376 --> 00:14:23,843
Gyeongam railroad village.

344
00:14:24,809 --> 00:14:26,443
- Like this. / - Railroad.

345
00:14:27,443 --> 00:14:30,209
The railroads of this village aren't

346
00:14:30,209 --> 00:14:34,309
used by trains like the ones we rode.

347
00:14:34,309 --> 00:14:37,809
A paper-manufacturing company made

348
00:14:37,809 --> 00:14:40,243
this railroad to transport paper.

349
00:14:40,243 --> 00:14:43,543
They made this railroad in 1943.

350
00:14:43,543 --> 00:14:46,043
They still used this railroad

351
00:14:46,043 --> 00:14:48,543
in 2008 and even till 2010.

352
00:14:48,543 --> 00:14:53,176
People still live in these houses next to it.

353
00:14:54,343 --> 00:14:56,909
- Isn't that interesting? / - School uniforms!

354
00:14:56,909 --> 00:14:58,043
Should we try them on?

355
00:14:58,043 --> 00:15:00,576
This place is nice because...

356
00:15:00,576 --> 00:15:02,343
- You can rent school uniforms. / - Right.

357
00:15:02,343 --> 00:15:03,276
Isn't it expensive?

358
00:15:03,276 --> 00:15:05,876
It cost $5 for 30 minutes.

359
00:15:05,876 --> 00:15:08,309

361
00:15:10,043 --> 00:15:11,743
Can you also hire guy's school uniforms?

- That's right. The old uniforms. / - Yes, you can.

363
00:15:14,276 --> 00:15:16,609
- They even had ones for kids. / - Yes.

364
00:15:16,609 --> 00:15:19,743
Those are the sailor suits and these are all old uniforms.

365
00:15:19,743 --> 00:15:21,943
This is cute. How about wearing this?

366
00:15:21,943 --> 00:15:24,943
- Is this a sailor suit? / - Yes, it is.

367
00:15:26,476 --> 00:15:28,443
We can get changed in here.

368
00:15:28,443 --> 00:15:29,809
It's good.

369
00:15:29,809 --> 00:15:33,243

- Ta-da. / - Ta-da.

373
00:15:48,176 --> 00:15:49,209
It suits them well.

374
00:15:49,876 --> 00:15:53,143
The hats are for male students.

375
00:15:53,143 --> 00:15:54,243
We just wore them.

376
00:15:54,243 --> 00:15:56,276
I was really surprised.

377
00:15:56,276 --> 00:15:58,643
Female students didn't have hats.

378
00:15:58,643 --> 00:16:00,609
You look good.

379
00:16:00,609 --> 00:16:02,243
You're also pretty.

380
00:16:02,243 --> 00:16:04,676

381
00:16:15,209 --> 00:16:18,109
- What is this? / - I haven't seen those in ages.

382
00:16:18,109 --> 00:16:19,576
It's a raffle.

383
00:16:19,576 --> 00:16:21,976
They give you a prize according to what's written.

384
00:16:24,476 --> 00:16:26,076
1, 2, 3.

385
00:16:28,143 --> 00:16:31,143
- What is this? / - I kept getting a bust.

386
00:16:31,143 --> 00:16:32,876
I picked the worst prize.

387
00:16:32,876 --> 00:16:37,476
My prize is a mirror because I picked 5th place.

388
00:16:37,476 --> 00:16:40,109
I also want a mirror. I'll take this.

389
00:16:40,109 --> 00:16:42,909
It's really pretty. It looks vintage.

390
00:16:45,943 --> 00:16:49,276
There were so many photo spots along the way.

391
00:16:49,276 --> 00:16:54,009
(Back in the days when they met on the railway)

392
00:16:54,809 --> 00:16:56,043

There are friends over there.

396
00:17:02,009 --> 00:17:03,009
There are friends.

397
00:17:04,376 --> 00:17:06,943
- Hello. / - That happened for real.

398
00:17:09,443 --> 00:17:10,709

We greeted them and had fun.

406
00:17:32,209 --> 00:17:33,443
Let's try junk food.

407
00:17:34,243 --> 00:17:35,709
There are a lot.

408
00:17:36,643 --> 00:17:38,009
I know this.

409
00:17:38,009 --> 00:17:41,243

410
00:17:41,243 --> 00:17:43,176
- How does she know that? / - You know that?

411
00:17:43,176 --> 00:17:45,776
Our members eat that sometimes.

412
00:17:45,776 --> 00:17:47,976
- What about this one? / - Okay.

413
00:17:47,976 --> 00:17:49,509
Do you know this?

415
00:17:51,343 --> 00:17:53,509
- What is it? / - It's some kind of a candy.

416
00:17:53,509 --> 00:17:54,843
It really reminds you of your childhood.

417
00:17:54,843 --> 00:17:56,876
- Cola flavor for me. / - Oh, wow.

418
00:17:56,876 --> 00:17:58,043
I also know this.

419
00:17:58,043 --> 00:17:59,976
I ate this in China.

420
00:17:59,976 --> 00:18:02,543
- Do they have this in China? / - Yes, it's the same.

421
00:18:02,543 --> 00:18:03,609
- Really? / - Yes.

422
00:18:04,676 --> 00:18:06,276
You can roast them...

423
00:18:06,276 --> 00:18:08,309
- Out in front there. / - This is great.

424
00:18:10,176 --> 00:18:12,409
I've never had them roasted over a fire before.

425
00:18:12,976 --> 00:18:13,509
Me neither.

426
00:18:13,743 --> 00:18:17,276
- It's delicious if you roast it. / - Yes.

427
00:18:17,276 --> 00:18:20,443
- I don't know why, but it's good. / - You're right.

00:18:20,443 --> 00:18:21,276
It smells good.

429
00:18:22,143 --> 00:18:23,709
You need to flip it right away.

430
00:18:23,709 --> 00:18:26,976
It's good when it bubbles like blisters.

431
00:18:26,976 --> 00:18:29,576
- It's better when it's a bit burnt. / - You're right.

432
00:18:29,576 --> 00:18:30,776
It tastes better when it's a little burnt.

433
00:18:32,943 --> 00:18:34,143
Let me try one piece.

434
00:18:36,909 --> 00:18:37,909
It's hot.

435
00:18:40,576 --> 00:18:41,876
That really looks good.

436
00:18:41,876 --> 00:18:44,043
- It's like roasted rice cakes. / - That's right.

437
00:18:44,043 --> 00:18:45,209
- Right? / - Yeah.

438
00:18:45,209 --> 00:18:47,076
It tastes sweeter.

439
00:18:47,076 --> 00:18:48,776
It's good.

440
00:18:48,776 --> 00:18:50,309
- Do you like it? / - Yeah.

441
00:18:52,043 --> 00:18:53,143
(She eats it whole)

442
00:18:57,043 --> 00:18:59,043
It's really soft.

443
00:18:59,976 --> 00:19:01,943
That really looks good. It's best when it's warm.

444
00:19:02,776 --> 00:19:04,776
- I want to try that too. / - This, this.

445
00:19:05,976 --> 00:19:07,643
I'll teach

446
00:19:07,643 --> 00:19:10,376
you how to eat this straw snack easily.

447
00:19:10,376 --> 00:19:13,776
- Okay. / - Rub it like you're massaging it.

448
00:19:13,776 --> 00:19:17,243
- Like this? / - Yes, and then...

449
00:19:17,243 --> 00:19:20,009
It comes out like this.

450
00:19:20,009 --> 00:19:21,076
That's correct.

451
00:19:21,076 --> 00:19:22,576
I also ate this in China.

452
00:19:22,576 --> 00:19:24,743
- Do you have this in China? / - Yes.

453
00:19:24,743 --> 00:19:27,243

There were a lot of cute things.

1, 2, 3.

459
00:19:39,709 --> 00:19:41,576
We really posted the photos we took

00:19:41,576 --> 00:19:43,043
on our social media.

461
00:19:43,043 --> 00:19:45,276

The railroad village.

463
00:19:48,243 --> 00:19:50,843

00:19:57,643 --> 00:19:58,376
(Verified)

469

- You can only eat this in Gunsan. / - Spicy rice cakes.

481
00:20:29,109 --> 00:20:30,476
That looks like spicy rice cakes with noodles.

482
00:20:30,476 --> 00:20:32,376
- It looks that way... / - That looks good.

483
00:20:32,376 --> 00:20:35,176
But it doesn't taste like it.

- I've never tried that. / - It's my first time seeing it.

485
00:20:37,576 --> 00:20:41,209
(10 minutes from the railroad village to the restaurant)

486
00:20:41,576 --> 00:20:44,009

00:20:51,509 --> 00:20:52,909
You can order it as a set

491
00:20:52,909 --> 00:20:54,676
with two servings of rice rolls.

492
00:20:54,676 --> 00:20:56,809
- It's a snack food restaurant. / - Yes.

493
00:20:56,809 --> 00:20:58,676

It's already out.

495
00:21:02,009 --> 00:21:03,243
The rice rolls are here.

496
00:21:07,976 --> 00:21:09,109
What is this?

497
00:21:10,343 --> 00:21:12,043
It's vinegar pepper paste.

498
00:21:12,043 --> 00:21:13,743
Yes, Gunsan people dip it in that.

499
00:21:13,743 --> 00:21:16,376

Why do you dip rice rolls in this?

502
00:21:20,776 --> 00:21:22,809
It tastes sweeter when you dip it

503
00:21:22,809 --> 00:21:23,876
in vinegar pepper paste.

504
00:21:26,276 --> 00:21:28,243

- It tastes like sushi. / - You're right.

508
00:21:35,009 --> 00:21:38,376
The harmony of rice, rice rolls and sesame oil is

509
00:21:38,376 --> 00:21:40,509
complete with the pepper paste.

510
00:21:40,509 --> 00:21:43,276
It tastes like a flatfish is swimming

511
00:21:43,276 --> 00:21:45,409
and prancing in the sea inside my mouth.

512
00:21:45,409 --> 00:21:47,943
I thought it wouldn't pair well.

513
00:21:47,943 --> 00:21:50,309
- But it was like sushi. / - This is really good.

514
00:21:50,776 --> 00:21:51,543

That couldn't taste bad.

520
00:22:07,243 --> 00:22:10,209
I thought it would be like a soup.

521
00:22:10,209 --> 00:22:12,043
- It's just spicy rice cakes. / - Spicy rice cake soup.

522
00:22:12,043 --> 00:22:14,243
- It's like spicy rice cakes cooked on the spot. / - Yes.

523
00:22:14,243 --> 00:22:15,843
I thought it was a soup,

524
00:22:15,843 --> 00:22:17,609
so I was thinking to eat it with rice.

525
00:22:21,043 --> 00:22:24,176
It had a really familiar taste.

526
00:22:24,176 --> 00:22:26,676
- But it's not spicy rice cakes. / - It's not the same.

527
00:22:28,443 --> 00:22:31,643
(Let's try it again)

528
00:22:31,643 --> 00:22:32,976
What does this taste like?

529
00:22:34,143 --> 00:22:36,109
- It's not spicy rice cakes. / - Right?

530
00:22:36,109 --> 00:22:39,309
- I love spicy rice cakes. / - Yeah.

531
00:22:39,309 --> 00:22:41,309
It's similar but not exactly spicy rice cakes.

532
00:22:41,809 --> 00:22:43,343
It tastes different.

533
00:22:43,343 --> 00:22:46,276
It's not spicy rice cakes. I don't think it is.

534
00:22:46,276 --> 00:22:47,809
It's more like pepper paste stew?

535
00:22:49,309 --> 00:22:51,409
- Yes, it was a little similar. / - I want to try it.

536
00:22:51,409 --> 00:22:52,509
The more you eat,

537
00:22:52,509 --> 00:22:54,509
the more you crave the taste.

538
00:22:54,509 --> 00:22:56,709
I should live in Gunsan.

539
00:22:56,709 --> 00:22:59,609
I really recommend this.

540
00:23:00,243 --> 00:23:03,409
We're eating this in Gunsan.

541
00:23:03,409 --> 00:23:04,043
It's mixed soup.

542
00:23:04,043 --> 00:23:07,343
We kept posting on social media.

543
00:23:07,343 --> 00:23:09,643
We'll probably be able to get 10,000 likes.

544
00:23:09,643 --> 00:23:11,976
We p-p-probably will.

545
00:23:12,509 --> 00:23:13,843
- After eating this. / - Okay.

546
00:23:13,843 --> 00:23:16,376
Let's go to the street of Japanese style houses.

547
00:23:16,376 --> 00:23:19,009
Let's see a lot of the old style of living.

548
00:23:19,743 --> 00:23:21,909
In Gunsan, you can experience

549
00:23:21,909 --> 00:23:24,709
many exotic scenes.

550
00:23:24,709 --> 00:23:26,209
There are a lot of tile-roofed houses.

551
00:23:26,209 --> 00:23:29,076
During the Japanese colonial era,

552
00:23:29,076 --> 00:23:31,443
that used to be the port they transported

553
00:23:31,443 --> 00:23:34,009
Korean rice to Japan.

554
00:23:35,109 --> 00:23:38,109
(Time Travel Road)

555
00:23:38,109 --> 00:23:41,809
- This is the Time Travel Road. / - You're right.

556
00:23:41,809 --> 00:23:45,076
There are a lot of Japanese style houses remaining.

557
00:23:45,076 --> 00:23:46,943
There are a lot of modern apartment buildings there.

558
00:23:46,943 --> 00:23:48,976
- But there are old buildings here. / - Right.

559
00:23:48,976 --> 00:23:50,576
Old Japanese style buildings.

560
00:23:50,576 --> 00:23:52,076
It's like going back and forth

561
00:23:52,076 --> 00:23:53,476
between the past and present.

562
00:23:53,476 --> 00:23:55,409
There are apartment buildings in the back,

563
00:23:55,409 --> 00:23:57,643
but the buildings are different here.

564
00:24:00,076 --> 00:24:03,143
- It's a Japanese garden. / - Yes, that place is...

565
00:24:03,143 --> 00:24:06,609
Preserved to not forget

566
00:24:06,609 --> 00:24:10,243
the pain of losing our country.

567
00:24:10,243 --> 00:24:14,243
This building was here since the 1930s.

568
00:24:14,243 --> 00:24:16,209
I think you can lodge here.

569
00:24:16,209 --> 00:24:18,576
- Can you sleep here? / - Yes.

570
00:24:18,576 --> 00:24:22,176
Anyone can enter and see this place...

571
00:24:22,176 --> 00:24:24,709
- Even if you don't stay here. / - Can everyone visit?

572
00:24:24,709 --> 00:24:27,009
If we take pictures here,

573
00:24:27,009 --> 00:24:28,543
people will think we're in Japan.

574
00:24:28,543 --> 00:24:30,443
Yeah. It's so pretty here.

575
00:24:30,443 --> 00:24:32,276
I think we should try to take some good pictures.

576
00:24:34,643 --> 00:24:35,476
My goodness.

577
00:24:37,443 --> 00:24:39,109
Without the apartments in the back,

578
00:24:39,109 --> 00:24:40,309
it really seems like Japan.

579
00:24:40,309 --> 00:24:41,009
Time passes by

580
00:24:41,009 --> 00:24:43,243
when they're just taking photos of each other.

581
00:24:43,243 --> 00:24:45,276
It's really pretty, isn't it?

582
00:24:45,276 --> 00:24:46,509
Should we keep going?

583
00:24:46,509 --> 00:24:48,076
- Here? There? / - Yeah.

584
00:24:49,509 --> 00:24:53,943
(They wander the streets here and there)

585
00:24:56,409 --> 00:24:59,209
- Chowon Photo Studio. / - That was in a movie.

586
00:24:59,209 --> 00:25:01,043
- Sim Eunha? / - That's right.

587
00:25:01,043 --> 00:25:02,109
- "Christmas in August." / - "Christmas in August."

588
00:25:02,109 --> 00:25:03,609
- "Christmas in August." / - That's right.

589
00:25:03,609 --> 00:25:04,709
Chowon Photo Studio.

590
00:25:04,709 --> 00:25:06,043
Photo studio.

591
00:25:06,043 --> 00:25:09,176
While wandering around, I realized that Gunsan had

592
00:25:09,176 --> 00:25:12,676
a lot of nice places to go on foot.

593
00:25:12,676 --> 00:25:16,909
- We need a cool drink now. / - You're right.

594
00:25:17,643 --> 00:25:19,943
- Millstone coffee? / - What coffee?

595
00:25:19,943 --> 00:25:22,209
It's a cafe where they sell that coffee.

596
00:25:22,209 --> 00:25:24,209
- Isn't this nice? Let's go in. / - This place is pretty.

597
00:25:24,209 --> 00:25:25,109
Let's go.

598
00:25:25,109 --> 00:25:27,743
(The interior looks like an ordinary cafe)

599
00:25:28,543 --> 00:25:30,143
What is this place, a cafe?

600
00:25:30,143 --> 00:25:31,343
It's a cafe.

601
00:25:31,343 --> 00:25:32,643
(Millstone)

602
00:25:32,643 --> 00:25:33,576
- It's a millstone. / - What's that?

603
00:25:36,043 --> 00:25:39,376
- Do we grind the coffee with this? / - Yes.

604
00:25:39,376 --> 00:25:41,609
First, place the beans on top.

605
00:25:41,609 --> 00:25:44,043
Put some of them inside with a spoon.

606
00:25:44,043 --> 00:25:45,709
Turn the handle to the left.

607
00:25:47,176 --> 00:25:49,009
(Grind the beans by turning to the left)

608
00:25:49,009 --> 00:25:50,576
That's unique.

609
00:25:50,576 --> 00:25:52,609
- It must smell good. / - Yes.

610
00:25:52,609 --> 00:25:56,643
It smells richer than grinding it with a grinder.

611
00:25:56,643 --> 00:25:58,276
That's why people try this a lot.

612
00:25:58,276 --> 00:26:00,309
The aroma...

613
00:26:00,309 --> 00:26:02,243
- It hits you right away. / - It does.

614
00:26:02,243 --> 00:26:04,176
It was really fun to grind it like that.

615
00:26:04,176 --> 00:26:05,709
- It's an uncommon experience. / - You're right.

616
00:26:05,709 --> 00:26:08,276
Please grant our wish.

617
00:26:10,309 --> 00:26:11,443
"I'm dumbfounded."

618
00:26:11,443 --> 00:26:14,576
- Wasn't that Yu Ain? / - "Do you know what it's called?"

619
00:26:15,343 --> 00:26:16,876
"I'm dumbfounded."

620
00:26:17,343 --> 00:26:18,743
If you're like this...

621
00:26:18,743 --> 00:26:20,509
- "I'm dumbfounded." / - "I'm dumbfounded."

622
00:26:21,409 --> 00:26:22,343
If you're like this...

623
00:26:22,343 --> 00:26:24,043
- "You know what to say." / - "You know what to say."

624
00:26:26,576 --> 00:26:27,743
You need to take your time.

625
00:26:27,743 --> 00:26:31,609
Pour water gently in the middle.

626
00:26:31,609 --> 00:26:33,643
- Slowly. / - Yes.

627
00:26:35,309 --> 00:26:38,409
You can pour some more water.

628
00:26:39,409 --> 00:26:41,276
It's ready.

629
00:26:41,276 --> 00:26:45,009
- We ground this. / - It's our coffee.

630
00:26:45,009 --> 00:26:47,243
- Please judge the flavor. / - Okay.

631
00:26:47,909 --> 00:26:51,209
This is my second day of drinking coffee.

632
00:26:51,209 --> 00:26:52,509
- Really? / - What?

633
00:26:52,509 --> 00:26:54,009
- She couldn't drink coffee. / - I couldn't.

634
00:26:54,009 --> 00:26:56,143
Just one sip and I can't sleep.

635
00:26:56,143 --> 00:26:57,809
- And your heart beats fast? / - Yes.

636
00:26:59,509 --> 00:27:00,843
How is it?

637
00:27:01,443 --> 00:27:02,576
- It's good. / - Yes.

638
00:27:03,576 --> 00:27:05,176
It's not bitter.

639
00:27:05,176 --> 00:27:06,943
- It's not that bitter. / - Yes.

640
00:27:06,943 --> 00:27:08,609
This isn't that bitter.

641
00:27:08,609 --> 00:27:12,109
I think it'd be good for people who don't drink coffee.

642
00:27:13,043 --> 00:27:18,076
Let's end our experience in Gunsan.

643
00:27:18,076 --> 00:27:18,809
Now...

644
00:27:21,043 --> 00:27:23,043
Wait a minute.

645
00:27:23,043 --> 00:27:24,909
What did I say in the morning?

646
00:27:24,909 --> 00:27:26,909
This was my goal. I even skipped breakfast.

647
00:27:26,909 --> 00:27:27,643
You skipped breakfast

648
00:27:27,643 --> 00:27:29,576
but ate rice rolls and mixed soup.

649
00:27:29,576 --> 00:27:31,243
- That's right. / - Those were appetizers.

650
00:27:32,576 --> 00:27:33,809
It's beef ribs.

651
00:27:35,043 --> 00:27:38,009
Not only us but the staff also liked this place.

652
00:27:38,009 --> 00:27:40,409
- That really looks good. / - It was really delicious.

653
00:27:40,409 --> 00:27:41,143
Look at that cheese.

654
00:27:41,543 --> 00:27:45,476
(Let's go eat appetizing beef ribs)

655
00:27:45,476 --> 00:27:46,409
(Time Travel Road)

656
00:27:46,409 --> 00:27:47,109
(Verified)

657
00:27:48,143 --> 00:27:50,909
- Beef ribs. / - That's worth it.

658
00:27:50,909 --> 00:27:54,476
- It's what we've waited for. / - The beef ribs!

659
00:27:55,976 --> 00:27:57,543
Let's go eat beef ribs.

660
00:27:57,543 --> 00:27:59,076
- It's this place. / - Go, go, go.

661
00:27:59,976 --> 00:28:00,743
It's mine.

662
00:28:00,743 --> 00:28:05,009
This place is a hidden gem

663
00:28:05,009 --> 00:28:07,809
where the people of Gunsan come and eat.

664
00:28:07,809 --> 00:28:09,609
- I'm curious about something. / - What?

665
00:28:09,609 --> 00:28:12,843
- Why do they have ice boxes here? / - For every table.

666
00:28:12,843 --> 00:28:14,543
- What's inside? / - Every table has it.

667
00:28:14,543 --> 00:28:16,209
- Why do they have an ice box? / - I think...

668
00:28:16,209 --> 00:28:16,943
What is that?

669
00:28:16,943 --> 00:28:20,143
- It has an incredible hidden charm. / - Or the ribs.

670
00:28:20,143 --> 00:28:21,076
The beef ribs?

671
00:28:23,476 --> 00:28:25,676
- I didn't know what it was. / - Are those drinks?

672
00:28:25,676 --> 00:28:28,276
You're happy to just see bottles at that age.

673
00:28:29,109 --> 00:28:32,109
- It's an age where you get excited. / - I know.

674
00:28:36,343 --> 00:28:38,443
What is this? I've never seen anything like this.

675
00:28:38,443 --> 00:28:40,043
So you can have it ice cold.

676
00:28:41,809 --> 00:28:44,009
- That's nice. / - That's amazing.

677
00:28:44,009 --> 00:28:46,043
What is this? I've never seen anything like this before.

678
00:28:46,943 --> 00:28:49,643
They put it here like this

679
00:28:49,643 --> 00:28:51,243
so you can drink it ice cold.

680
00:28:51,243 --> 00:28:53,543
They put it there to make you want to drink.

681
00:28:53,543 --> 00:28:57,043
- You can't help but drink. / - That's right.

682
00:28:57,043 --> 00:28:59,343
We can't show how much we're happy to see this.

683
00:29:00,143 --> 00:29:02,976
- I'm looking forward to the food. / - Yeah.

684
00:29:04,609 --> 00:29:06,843
- They're bringing it. / - It's here.

685

- It's free of charge. / - Is it free?

687
00:29:14,543 --> 00:29:17,076
- They give you kimchi stew for free? / - Yes.

688
00:29:17,076 --> 00:29:19,209
- That's ridiculous. / - To make you drink alcohol.

689
00:29:19,209 --> 00:29:21,509
Are you giving this for free?

690
00:29:21,509 --> 00:29:22,676
That's amazing.

691
00:29:24,809 --> 00:29:26,076
Is this the main dish?

692
00:29:28,376 --> 00:29:29,376
It looks amazing.

693
00:29:32,243 --> 00:29:32,909
This is amazing.

694
00:29:34,176 --> 00:29:36,476
- The egg roll is free too. / - That's a great spread.

695
00:29:36,476 --> 00:29:37,543
The food is all free of charge.

696
00:29:37,543 --> 00:29:39,409
- A lot of freebies. / - That's cheating.

697
00:29:40,576 --> 00:29:41,476
I'm going to take a photo of this.

698
00:29:44,609 --> 00:29:45,876
- That's amazing. / - They keep...

699
00:29:45,876 --> 00:29:48,509
Giving you more if you order.

700
00:29:48,509 --> 00:29:50,809
The stone pot rice is only $2?

701
00:29:50,809 --> 00:29:53,409
They give you scorched rice water at the end.

702
00:29:54,809 --> 00:29:57,909
You finish your meal with this.

703
00:29:59,343 --> 00:30:01,576
She really is bold.

704
00:30:01,576 --> 00:30:03,909
An experienced hand is different.

705
00:30:05,009 --> 00:30:05,743
You first.

706
00:30:10,976 --> 00:30:13,043
- You're so cute. / - Thank you.

707
00:30:14,609 --> 00:30:16,243
Thank you.

708
00:30:16,243 --> 00:30:17,876
Today was so fun.

709
00:30:24,943 --> 00:30:27,676
Let's eat the ribs first.

710
00:30:27,676 --> 00:30:29,043
Yes, I think we can eat it now.

711
00:30:32,309 --> 00:30:34,976
You really eat well.

712
00:30:35,709 --> 00:30:38,109
Thank you for the food. Sorry, guys.

713
00:30:38,109 --> 00:30:39,676
For eating this alone. Let's eat together next time.

714
00:30:39,676 --> 00:30:41,443
Let's come back together.

715
00:30:44,809 --> 00:30:46,609
- She eats like Moon Seyoon. / - It's like she's in...

716
00:30:46,609 --> 00:30:48,609
A historical drama.

717
00:30:48,976 --> 00:30:51,676
- Doesn't she eat like Yoo Minsang? / - So cute.

718
00:30:52,809 --> 00:30:56,509
- All of our members will like this. / - Yes.

719
00:31:02,909 --> 00:31:04,176
You can't eat it with chopsticks.

720
00:31:05,809 --> 00:31:08,509
(Beef ribs taste best using your fingers)

721
00:31:09,376 --> 00:31:11,609
It's really delicious.

722
00:31:11,609 --> 00:31:13,809
- This was really good. / - This was really good.

723
00:31:13,809 --> 00:31:15,409
So much.

724
00:31:15,409 --> 00:31:17,709
- What do we do? / - The meat just falls off.

725
00:31:17,709 --> 00:31:19,176
The meat comes right off the bone.

726
00:31:22,576 --> 00:31:25,076
I understood why the people of Gunsan said

727
00:31:25,076 --> 00:31:27,143
that this place was really good.

728
00:31:29,076 --> 00:31:35,943
(They eat and eat and eat)

729
00:31:37,943 --> 00:31:40,543
- This is really good. / - It's really good.

730
00:31:40,543 --> 00:31:42,609
No matter what you do, the cheese doesn't tear.

731
00:31:45,643 --> 00:31:47,709
- Then... / - It's so good.

732
00:31:48,609 --> 00:31:51,176
Let's try shooting a rib advertisement.

733
00:31:51,176 --> 00:31:51,909
Okay.

734
00:31:52,543 --> 00:31:54,243
- Do you want me to cover you up? / - Yes.

735
00:31:56,943 --> 00:31:59,443
1, 2, 3.

736
00:32:01,443 --> 00:32:02,843
What is this sound?

737
00:32:02,843 --> 00:32:03,843
Beef ribs!

738
00:32:05,709 --> 00:32:07,376
(Embarrassed)

739
00:32:09,643 --> 00:32:11,209
All we did was eat.

740
00:32:11,209 --> 00:32:13,543
- Sikyung, you okay? / - So we needed more footage.

741
00:32:13,543 --> 00:32:14,909
Let's do this!

742
00:32:16,243 --> 00:32:17,609
- But... / - Sikyung, are you okay?

743
00:32:17,609 --> 00:32:19,376
- Isn't she cute? / - Yes.

744
00:32:19,376 --> 00:32:21,276
It was a little difficult for me.

745
00:32:21,276 --> 00:32:22,376
But she's cute.

746
00:32:24,343 --> 00:32:25,909
What is this sound?

747
00:32:25,909 --> 00:32:26,843
Beef ribs!

748
00:32:31,076 --> 00:32:32,476
Eat, just eat.

749
00:32:34,676 --> 00:32:37,209
Let's eat. Let's just eat.

750
00:32:38,243 --> 00:32:39,709
This is really good.

751
00:32:39,709 --> 00:32:40,876
We need to try this.

752
00:32:42,009 --> 00:32:44,009
This is the freebie stew.

753
00:32:51,976 --> 00:32:53,776
- It's refreshing. / - Right?

754
00:32:53,776 --> 00:32:55,609
It's so delicious.

755
00:32:55,609 --> 00:32:56,576
It's really good.

756
00:32:59,209 --> 00:33:00,509
This is like...

757
00:33:04,843 --> 00:33:06,243
Should we try the scorched rice?

758
00:33:07,209 --> 00:33:09,309
Here's the best way to eat it.

759
00:33:10,176 --> 00:33:11,409
With green onion kimchi...

760
00:33:12,843 --> 00:33:13,676
With kimchi?

761
00:33:15,043 --> 00:33:16,609
You all know, right?

762
00:33:16,609 --> 00:33:18,943
- It's common knowledge. / - It's what Koreans like.

763
00:33:18,943 --> 00:33:20,843
- We acknowledge it. / - Jeolla-do kimchi...

764
00:33:20,843 --> 00:33:22,876
Jeolla-do kimchi was so good.

765
00:33:22,876 --> 00:33:23,543
Like this?

766
00:33:29,243 --> 00:33:32,576
If you eat a spicy dish...

767
00:33:33,076 --> 00:33:34,809
And this is refreshing... It's like

768
00:33:34,809 --> 00:33:36,576
washing out your mouth with this.

769
00:33:36,576 --> 00:33:38,209
- It looks good. / - It really looks delicious.

770
00:33:38,209 --> 00:33:40,843
Do you think we can get 10,000 likes here?

771
00:33:40,843 --> 00:33:43,209
- I'm sure they will. / - It's a hidden place.

772
00:33:43,809 --> 00:33:45,809
Don't you think they'll give us likes?

773
00:33:45,809 --> 00:33:47,809
This place is...

774
00:33:47,809 --> 00:33:50,409
A place I'd like everyone to visit at least once.

775
00:33:50,409 --> 00:33:52,176
This is that good.

776
00:33:52,176 --> 00:33:55,876
Time to get 10,000 likes on social media.

777
00:33:56,376 --> 00:33:58,276
It's the final course of today's trip.

778
00:33:59,076 --> 00:34:00,209
Let's go see the night view.

779
00:34:00,209 --> 00:34:02,276
- Is it the last course already? / - Yes.

780
00:34:04,943 --> 00:34:06,243
It's perfect for a date.

781
00:34:06,243 --> 00:34:07,943
- Eunpa Lake Park. / - Right.

782
00:34:07,943 --> 00:34:09,776
- It's so beautiful. / - Wow.

783
00:34:12,709 --> 00:34:16,076
Now that we've had dinner, we should go

784
00:34:16,076 --> 00:34:17,176
to the final destination...

785
00:34:17,176 --> 00:34:19,876
- In Gunsan. / - Eunpa Lake Park.

786
00:34:19,876 --> 00:34:22,609
The bridge over there is

787
00:34:22,609 --> 00:34:25,576
the most famous landmark in Gunsan.

788
00:34:25,576 --> 00:34:28,143
It'd be nice to walk on the bridge.

789
00:34:28,143 --> 00:34:31,543
What was the most memorable place for you today?

790
00:34:32,209 --> 00:34:33,576
For me...

791
00:34:35,676 --> 00:34:36,976
It'd have to be

792
00:34:36,976 --> 00:34:39,076
wearing old school uniforms

793
00:34:39,076 --> 00:34:40,943
and taking photos.

794
00:34:40,943 --> 00:34:42,743
I think they're all lasting memories.

795
00:34:42,743 --> 00:34:44,609
For me...

796
00:34:44,609 --> 00:34:46,976
We had this goal

797
00:34:46,976 --> 00:34:50,143
to get 10,000 likes

798
00:34:50,143 --> 00:34:52,543
on social media.

799
00:34:52,543 --> 00:34:54,209
Regardless of that, I just liked that

800
00:34:54,209 --> 00:34:56,443
we took pictures together and made good memories.

801
00:34:56,443 --> 00:34:59,776
Like you said, everything was so good.

802
00:34:59,776 --> 00:35:03,443
- Exactly. I can't pick one place. / - Right.

803
00:35:03,443 --> 00:35:06,076
- Everything was so nice. / - I loved it.

804
00:35:06,076 --> 00:35:08,609
I hope people will fall in love

805
00:35:08,609 --> 00:35:10,743
with the charms of Gunsan.

806
00:35:10,743 --> 00:35:13,143
- This has been Cheng Xiao's... / - And Eunseo's

807
00:35:13,143 --> 00:35:14,809
I Wish Gunsan.

808
00:35:14,809 --> 00:35:16,376
Bye!

809
00:35:18,009 --> 00:35:20,676
(Today's trip to Gunsan finished)

810
00:35:20,676 --> 00:35:22,943
That was Gunsan.

811
00:35:22,943 --> 00:35:26,443
It was cool. First, I liked the train.

812
00:35:26,443 --> 00:35:29,609
- The train was great. / - I have to admit this.

813
00:35:29,609 --> 00:35:32,776
For a father of children like me...

814
00:35:32,876 --> 00:35:35,576
A room with a heated floor is really good.

815
00:35:36,109 --> 00:35:39,376
The ticket price of the train is not that expensive.

816
00:35:39,376 --> 00:35:40,709
If you use the room with 6 people,

817
00:35:40,709 --> 00:35:42,276
it costs $5 per person.

818
00:35:42,276 --> 00:35:44,309
- It's $30 for a room. / - Yes, $30 a room.

819
00:35:44,309 --> 00:35:45,309
It's really cheap.

820
00:35:45,309 --> 00:35:47,576
You just need to pay an extra $30.

821
00:35:47,576 --> 00:35:50,543
You can enjoy a comfortable trip for a good price.

822
00:35:50,543 --> 00:35:51,676
The one thing that's disappointing

823
00:35:51,676 --> 00:35:54,076
is that it only runs once a day.

824
00:35:54,076 --> 00:35:55,676
8 a.m. is a little too early.

825
00:35:55,676 --> 00:35:57,943
- You should get ready the night before. / - Right.

826
00:35:57,943 --> 00:36:00,209
We'll check the social media rankings.

827
00:36:00,209 --> 00:36:01,509
- What's in 1st place? / - 10,000 likes.

828
00:36:01,509 --> 00:36:03,943
- 1st place is... / - Railroad village.

829
00:36:03,943 --> 00:36:07,509
The railroad village got more likes than the ribs.

830
00:36:07,509 --> 00:36:10,609
- Really? / - They got more than 23,000 likes.

831
00:36:11,943 --> 00:36:14,009
In fact, I love eating.

832
00:36:14,009 --> 00:36:16,476
I thought ribs would be 1st.

833
00:36:16,476 --> 00:36:18,243
- But it's in 4th place. / - Alright.

834
00:36:18,243 --> 00:36:19,443
The budget is important.

835
00:36:19,443 --> 00:36:20,743
- How much did they spend? / - Eunseo.

836
00:36:20,743 --> 00:36:21,976
- Yes? / - What was your budget?

837
00:36:21,976 --> 00:36:24,209
The amount that I Wish Gunsan spent

838
00:36:24,209 --> 00:36:26,609
for that one day is...

839
00:36:27,743 --> 00:36:29,043
- Per person. / - Per person.

840
00:36:29,043 --> 00:36:31,976
It was $84.30 per person.

841
00:36:34,009 --> 00:36:34,676
Goodness.

842
00:36:36,476 --> 00:36:38,509
It doesn't cost much since they don't drink.

843
00:36:38,509 --> 00:36:41,176
He's right. You enjoyed the trip at a reasonable price.

844
00:36:41,176 --> 00:36:42,076
- Well planned. / - Good job.

845
00:36:42,076 --> 00:36:44,809
Shall we take this time to do the vote?

846
00:36:44,809 --> 00:36:47,109
- Okay. / - Let's do that.

847
00:36:47,109 --> 00:36:49,776
Will you travel to Gunsan according to their plan?

848
00:36:49,776 --> 00:36:51,376
Please vote.

849
00:36:52,409 --> 00:36:54,476
(I Wish Gunsan Tour planned a trip to Gunsan)

850
00:36:54,843 --> 00:36:57,843
(What will the judges choose?)

851
00:36:58,543 --> 00:37:01,543
So we just went to Gunsan.

852
00:37:01,543 --> 00:37:03,076
It's time to go to Gyeongju now.

853
00:37:03,643 --> 00:37:05,743
What's the point we should focus on?

854
00:37:05,743 --> 00:37:06,743
Is it Cheomseongdae?

855
00:37:09,709 --> 00:37:12,109
We've all been to Cheomgseongdae.

856
00:37:12,109 --> 00:37:13,409
I've seen it so much.

857
00:37:13,409 --> 00:37:15,276
That's what we were worried about.

858
00:37:15,276 --> 00:37:18,176
But it turns out Gyeongju is very modern now.

859
00:37:18,176 --> 00:37:20,543
- It's changed a lot. / - It's very popular now.

860
00:37:20,543 --> 00:37:22,276
- He's right. / - It is popular.

861
00:37:22,276 --> 00:37:24,876
When I was young, I went there to see historical sites.

862
00:37:24,876 --> 00:37:28,409
But going back with Sujeong as an adult...

863
00:37:28,409 --> 00:37:30,276
- It felt quite different. / - Right.

864
00:37:30,276 --> 00:37:33,043
There's a reason why

865
00:37:33,043 --> 00:37:34,409
Yein and Sujeong

866
00:37:34,409 --> 00:37:36,709
are so confident with their trip to Gyeongju.

867
00:37:36,709 --> 00:37:38,676
If the Gunsan team received some

868
00:37:38,676 --> 00:37:40,809
confirmation through social media,

869
00:37:40,809 --> 00:37:43,809
the Gyeongju team had the largest

870
00:37:43,809 --> 00:37:45,743
number of people

871
00:37:45,743 --> 00:37:48,676
in Battle Trip history to join them on their trip.

872
00:37:48,676 --> 00:37:52,043
Yes. We had 8 trip designers.

873
00:37:52,043 --> 00:37:54,843
- Trip designers? / - The members of Lovelyz...

874
00:37:54,843 --> 00:37:58,409
Helped us plan our trip.

875
00:37:58,409 --> 00:38:01,676
They even made a list of recommended places.

876
00:38:01,676 --> 00:38:04,243
- Like important places to visit? / - They picked it out.

877
00:38:04,243 --> 00:38:05,709
- And you picked the best ones? / - They must've...

878
00:38:05,709 --> 00:38:07,776
Wanted to join you since they helped plan it.

879
00:38:07,776 --> 00:38:09,876
- Right. / - They just planned it with you...

880
00:38:09,876 --> 00:38:10,676
But couldn't join you.

881
00:38:10,676 --> 00:38:13,443
They kept telling us to go to their recommended places.

882
00:38:13,443 --> 00:38:15,176
"You have to go to this place."

883
00:38:15,176 --> 00:38:16,276
- To get vicarious satisfaction. / - Right.

884
00:38:16,276 --> 00:38:18,543
- Alright. / - Okay then.

885
00:38:18,543 --> 00:38:20,109
Let's watch it together.

886
00:38:20,109 --> 00:38:22,476
Gyeongju Tour!

887
00:38:27,576 --> 00:38:28,776
It's Battle Trip!

888
00:38:28,776 --> 00:38:29,609
1, 2, 3.

889
00:38:29,609 --> 00:38:32,443
- Hello, I'm Sujeong of Lovelyz. / - I'm Yein.

890
00:38:34,543 --> 00:38:38,709
(Lovelyz is one of the major girl groups in Korea)

891
00:38:42,509 --> 00:38:45,076
(The youngest members, Sujeong and Yein)

892
00:38:45,543 --> 00:38:47,176
What's that on the table?

893
00:38:47,176 --> 00:38:50,476
Since we're going to Gyeongju...

894
00:38:50,476 --> 00:38:51,943
- The members made these. / - Ta-da.

895
00:38:52,976 --> 00:38:55,676
- So nice. / - So they recommended the places.

896
00:38:56,909 --> 00:38:58,609
They wrote all that out for us.

897
00:38:58,609 --> 00:39:00,876
They worked hard for this.

898
00:39:00,876 --> 00:39:03,076
- It feels like we already won. / - I know.

899
00:39:03,076 --> 00:39:05,109
- It feels like we won. / - Ta-da.

900
00:39:05,109 --> 00:39:06,743
Why did you choose Gyeongju

901
00:39:06,743 --> 00:39:08,709
between Gunsan and Gyeongju?

902
00:39:08,709 --> 00:39:11,609
I went to Gyeongju with my family in middle school.

903
00:39:11,609 --> 00:39:14,109
I had so many good memories from then.

904
00:39:14,109 --> 00:39:17,009
So I wanted to go there one more time.

905
00:39:17,009 --> 00:39:20,176
Yein sounds so sure, so I thought it'd be good.

906
00:39:20,176 --> 00:39:23,009
I convinced her to go to Gyeongju.

907
00:39:23,009 --> 00:39:24,443
Are we finally in Gyeongju?

908
00:39:24,443 --> 00:39:25,643
This is Gyeongju.

909
00:39:28,043 --> 00:39:30,709
- Wow, Gyeongju. / - So pretty.

910
00:39:30,709 --> 00:39:31,176
What is that?

911
00:39:31,176 --> 00:39:33,309
- Donggung Palace and Wolji Pond. / - So pretty.

912
00:39:33,309 --> 00:39:34,609
- That's so pretty. / - So pretty.

913
00:39:34,609 --> 00:39:37,209
They didn't have those lights back then.

914
00:39:37,209 --> 00:39:38,409
I love this place.

915
00:39:38,409 --> 00:39:40,176
This is so good!

916
00:39:41,376 --> 00:39:43,676
They sound like dolphins.

917
00:39:43,676 --> 00:39:46,609
What's that?

918
00:39:47,043 --> 00:39:49,043
- We rode in a hot-air balloon. / - Hot-air balloon.

919
00:39:49,043 --> 00:39:50,576
Let's go in a hot-air balloon.

920
00:39:52,676 --> 00:39:54,643
- My gosh, look at that. / - Looks good.

921
00:39:54,643 --> 00:39:57,909
Goodness.

922
00:40:03,443 --> 00:40:05,209
- Bottoms up. / - What's that?

923
00:40:07,043 --> 00:40:08,776
- Since they're seniors... / - They drank soju.

924
00:40:08,776 --> 00:40:14,409
They're seniors so they drink soju.

925
00:40:14,409 --> 00:40:15,843
We ate it all.

926
00:40:15,843 --> 00:40:18,376
Gyeongju Tour with Deer Bread!

927
00:40:18,376 --> 00:40:22,009
(The real healing trip begins now)

928
00:40:22,609 --> 00:40:25,243
With the lists we got from the members...

929
00:40:25,243 --> 00:40:28,443
I'll decide what to do at night.

930
00:40:28,443 --> 00:40:29,876
You'll be in charge of the daytime.

931
00:40:29,876 --> 00:40:31,876
- Okay. / - Like shops and restaurants.

932
00:40:31,876 --> 00:40:35,276
Whatever Sujeong chooses,

933
00:40:35,276 --> 00:40:37,109
I can go there with faith.

934
00:40:37,109 --> 00:40:38,443
Your tour name...

935
00:40:38,443 --> 00:40:39,943
For our tour name...

936
00:40:40,676 --> 00:40:42,043
Do you have any idea?

937
00:40:42,843 --> 00:40:44,476
Let's Eat and Play, Deer Bread.

938
00:40:45,109 --> 00:40:47,809
My nickname is Water Deer

939
00:40:47,809 --> 00:40:48,943
- And she's Bread Cake. / - I'm Bread Cake.

940
00:40:49,909 --> 00:40:53,043
So our fans call us Deer Bread.

941
00:40:53,043 --> 00:40:54,443
Right. Deer Bread.

942
00:40:54,876 --> 00:40:56,043
Deer Bread Gyeongju Tour.

943
00:40:56,109 --> 00:40:58,043
Gyeongju Tour and Deer Bread?

944
00:40:58,443 --> 00:41:00,343
Gyeongju Tour with Deer Bread!

945
00:41:00,343 --> 00:41:02,243
Yeah, let's go with that.

946
00:41:02,243 --> 00:41:03,576
Since we'll be in Gyeongju.

947
00:41:03,576 --> 00:41:06,809
- The Water Deer and the Bread Cake. / - Right.

948
00:41:06,809 --> 00:41:09,076
Gyeongju Tour with Deer Bread.

949
00:41:09,076 --> 00:41:10,343
Let's win!

950
00:41:10,343 --> 00:41:12,476
- They're full of energy. / - Let's go.

951
00:41:12,476 --> 00:41:14,909
It's Gyeongju vs. Gunsan.

952
00:41:14,909 --> 00:41:17,476
- The chewy noodles sounds good. / - That was delicious.

953
00:41:20,576 --> 00:41:21,876
This is Gimpo Airport.

954
00:41:21,876 --> 00:41:23,476
We're at Gimpo Airport.

955
00:41:23,876 --> 00:41:26,076
The airport is so clean and pretty.

956
00:41:26,076 --> 00:41:27,676
The airport had improved a lot.

957
00:41:27,676 --> 00:41:29,409
- We went there by plane. / - Is it Gimpo Airport?

958
00:41:29,409 --> 00:41:30,876
- Yes, Gimpo Airport. / - Gimpo.

959
00:41:30,876 --> 00:41:35,009
- It feels like we're going abroad. / - I know.

960
00:41:35,009 --> 00:41:37,109
- We need our IDs. / - It feels like we're going abroad.

961
00:41:37,876 --> 00:41:42,743
We can take the KTX to Gyeongju

962
00:41:42,743 --> 00:41:43,909
or we can go by plane.

963
00:41:43,909 --> 00:41:45,543
It takes 50 minutes by plane.

964
00:41:45,543 --> 00:41:48,009
- 2 hours by KTX. / - Then we should go by plane.

965
00:41:48,009 --> 00:41:50,376
- It's only $5 difference. / - Then we should take a plane.

966
00:41:50,376 --> 00:41:51,776
Let's do that.

967
00:41:51,776 --> 00:41:56,309
When we arrive by plane, it takes 40 minutes by car

968
00:41:56,309 --> 00:41:57,809
from the airport to downtown Gyeongju.

969
00:41:57,809 --> 00:42:00,976
If we take the KTX, it takes 30 minutes

970
00:42:00,976 --> 00:42:03,143
from the train station to downtown Gyeongju.

971
00:42:03,143 --> 00:42:05,576
- It's almost the same. / - It's virtually the same.

972
00:42:05,576 --> 00:42:06,876
We can save one hour.

973
00:42:06,876 --> 00:42:10,509
Plus kids love going on the plane.

974
00:42:10,509 --> 00:42:12,443
There's a self check-in kiosk.

975
00:42:12,443 --> 00:42:14,276
Self check-in.

976
00:42:14,276 --> 00:42:16,509
- So we're checked in? / - I guess so.

977
00:42:18,909 --> 00:42:20,609
How convenient.

978
00:42:21,943 --> 00:42:23,543
- Look at that. / - What does it say?

979
00:42:23,543 --> 00:42:24,209
It says Ryu Sujeong.

980
00:42:25,243 --> 00:42:26,709
It has my name on it.

981
00:42:29,076 --> 00:42:33,009
(50 minutes from Gimpo to Pohang)

982
00:42:35,643 --> 00:42:37,576
This is Pohang Airport.

983
00:42:37,576 --> 00:42:40,543
- Pohang Airport. / - Airport.

984
00:42:40,743 --> 00:42:43,209
We've arrived at Pohang Airport.

985
00:42:43,209 --> 00:42:45,509
- It only cost $5 extra. / - I know.

986
00:42:45,509 --> 00:42:48,576
And we saved an hour. We can play for an extra hour.

987
00:42:48,576 --> 00:42:52,743
That's important. They get an extra one hour to stay.

988
00:42:52,743 --> 00:42:55,909
- You're in charge of the day. / - That's right.

989
00:42:55,909 --> 00:42:59,076
So what did you plan? What shall we do?

990
00:42:59,076 --> 00:43:01,576
Eating comes first in any situation, so let's eat first.

991
00:43:07,343 --> 00:43:08,043
That's good.

992
00:43:08,643 --> 00:43:11,643
- Kei said to eat warm chewy noodles. / - I love it.

993
00:43:11,643 --> 00:43:14,876
- It's in Gyeongju... / - Chewy noodles are great for lunch.

994
00:43:14,876 --> 00:43:17,009
Here is a taxi stand.

995
00:43:17,009 --> 00:43:19,843
- Let's take the taxi. / - Let's head to downtown.

996
00:43:19,843 --> 00:43:21,476
- Let's pick what to eat for lunch. / - Okay.

997
00:43:21,476 --> 00:43:23,376
- Let's decide lunch and dinner. / - Let's look at this.

998
00:43:23,376 --> 00:43:26,143
This is the Gyeongju tour course Kei recommends.

999
00:43:26,143 --> 00:43:29,709
- Great. / - This is warm chewy noodles.

1000
00:43:29,709 --> 00:43:31,443
Kei highly recommended it.

1001
00:43:31,443 --> 00:43:32,909
She said we must go.

1002
00:43:32,909 --> 00:43:34,276
Does Kei enjoy eating food?

1003
00:43:34,276 --> 00:43:36,576
- Yes, she does. / - Then you should listen to her.

1004
00:43:36,576 --> 00:43:39,876
Kei's sister lived in Gyeongju...

1005
00:43:39,876 --> 00:43:41,576
- For a long time. / - Right.

1006
00:43:41,576 --> 00:43:43,609
So Kei knows many good restaurants there.

1007
00:43:44,376 --> 00:43:49,476
(Sujeong's daytime tour, warm chewy noodles)

1008
00:43:49,943 --> 00:43:54,509
(It takes 40 minutes from Pohang to Gyeongju)

1009
00:43:54,509 --> 00:43:56,843
- Are we in Gyeongju now? / - Yes, we are.

1010
00:43:56,843 --> 00:43:59,243
The atmosphere is so cozy that I like it a lot.

1011
00:43:59,243 --> 00:44:00,909
- I like it too. / - And it's quiet.

1012
00:44:00,909 --> 00:44:02,309
I like it because there are no skyscrapers.

1013
00:44:02,309 --> 00:44:03,943
It was very quiet.

1014
00:44:03,943 --> 00:44:05,976
The signs look nostalgic.

1015
00:44:05,976 --> 00:44:07,376
The place we're going to

1016
00:44:07,376 --> 00:44:09,543
used to be famous as a bakery.

1017
00:44:09,543 --> 00:44:12,443
But they didn't change their sign yet

1018
00:44:12,443 --> 00:44:15,643
and are selling different types of chewy noodles.

1019
00:44:15,643 --> 00:44:18,043
Their sign still says it's a bakery.

1020
00:44:18,043 --> 00:44:20,543
So you should be careful not to be confused.

1021
00:44:21,809 --> 00:44:24,309
- There it is. Bakery. / - Where?

1022
00:44:24,309 --> 00:44:26,443
That's Sujeong's place.

1023
00:44:26,443 --> 00:44:28,876
- I must stop by. / - You must at a bakery.

1024
00:44:28,876 --> 00:44:30,443
- Let's go in. / - Let's get in.

1025
00:44:31,643 --> 00:44:36,743
(Warm and spicy chewy noodles are popular here)

1026
00:44:36,743 --> 00:44:39,976
($4 per bowl)

1027
00:44:39,976 --> 00:44:43,409
Do you know why it is called chewy noodles?

1028
00:44:43,409 --> 00:44:44,543
Because it's chewy?

1029
00:44:45,676 --> 00:44:47,876
- Am I right? / - I've done some research.

1030
00:44:48,509 --> 00:44:50,676
- Cold noodles are chewy, right? / - Yes.

1031
00:44:50,676 --> 00:44:52,209
But they mistakenly made them thick.

1032
00:44:52,209 --> 00:44:53,009
And it tasted really good.

1033
00:44:53,009 --> 00:44:54,343
- That's how they came about. / - Really?

1034
00:44:54,343 --> 00:44:57,276
- Mistakes are the mother of success. / - Right.

1035
00:44:57,276 --> 00:44:58,543
- It was a fail but it succeeded. / - Failure...

1036
00:44:58,543 --> 00:45:00,109
Failure is the mother of success.

1037
00:45:00,109 --> 00:45:01,643
Mistakes are the mother of success.

1038
00:45:03,009 --> 00:45:05,943
I didn't know success had two mothers.

1039
00:45:05,943 --> 00:45:06,976
As expected.

1040
00:45:06,976 --> 00:45:08,876
- The sesame oil smells so good. / - It's in here.

1041
00:45:08,876 --> 00:45:09,843
- It's in there? / - Yes.

1042
00:45:10,509 --> 00:45:11,743
Thanks for the food.

1043
00:45:15,409 --> 00:45:16,543
It looks good.

1044
00:45:16,743 --> 00:45:18,809
(I want to eat it so badly)

1045
00:45:19,143 --> 00:45:20,843
Try mine.

1046
00:45:25,176 --> 00:45:27,476
- Is it good? / - Yes.

1047
00:45:27,476 --> 00:45:28,809
Let me try it too.

1048
00:45:28,809 --> 00:45:29,443
Isn't it good?

1049
00:45:33,276 --> 00:45:35,376
It's spicy, sweet and sour.

1050
00:45:35,376 --> 00:45:37,109
I thought it would taste like ordinary chew noodles

1051
00:45:37,109 --> 00:45:39,543
but it tastes more like mixed noodles.

1052
00:45:41,043 --> 00:45:41,976
You're right.

1053
00:45:41,976 --> 00:45:43,809
It's the best chewy noodles I've ever had.

1054
00:45:43,809 --> 00:45:44,443
- It was? / - Yes.

1055
00:45:44,443 --> 00:45:46,176
You can adjust the spiciness

1056
00:45:46,176 --> 00:45:48,143
by controlling the amount of the sauce.

1057
00:45:48,143 --> 00:45:49,476
Warm chewy noodles.

1058
00:45:51,243 --> 00:45:53,609
The two dishes go very well with each other.

1059
00:46:01,176 --> 00:46:02,909
- Is it good? / - Yes.

1060
00:46:04,143 --> 00:46:05,443
Let's eat ice cream too because it's hot.

1061
00:46:06,843 --> 00:46:08,843
It's really good.

1062
00:46:09,743 --> 00:46:11,643
How is it different from ordinary chewy noodles?

1063
00:46:11,643 --> 00:46:15,943
It's like udon with thinner and chewier noodles.

1064
00:46:15,943 --> 00:46:17,676
- For people in Gyeongju... / - That looks so good.

1065
00:46:17,676 --> 00:46:19,476
They eat that to cure their hangovers.

1066
00:46:20,809 --> 00:46:22,743
It's chewy noodles

1067
00:46:22,743 --> 00:46:24,209
but it's interesting that it's served warm.

1068
00:46:24,209 --> 00:46:24,943
I think...

1069
00:46:25,709 --> 00:46:28,476
It's like udon with chewy noodles.

1070
00:46:28,843 --> 00:46:30,976
That's why it's different.

1071
00:46:34,443 --> 00:46:37,276
- Should we get some good eating shots? / - Okay.

1072
00:46:37,276 --> 00:46:38,776
- Let's shoot a commercial. / - Okay.

1073
00:46:39,509 --> 00:46:41,409
- Here we go. / - Everyone...

1074
00:46:41,409 --> 00:46:43,476
You have to taste warm chewy noodles in Gyeongju.

1075
00:46:43,476 --> 00:46:46,109
One bite for you and one for me.

1076
00:46:47,743 --> 00:46:49,743
- Pretty good, right? / - Not too bad.

1077
00:46:53,376 --> 00:46:54,309
Is it good?

1078
00:46:55,743 --> 00:46:57,243
"You can't imagine how good it is."

1079
00:46:58,709 --> 00:47:00,109
It's almost game over.

1080
00:47:00,109 --> 00:47:01,476
"You can't imagine how good it is."

1081
00:47:03,009 --> 00:47:05,176
(What was that?)

1082
00:47:06,509 --> 00:47:07,243
Let's just eat now.

1083
00:47:08,443 --> 00:47:09,309
So good.

1084
00:47:10,343 --> 00:47:12,543
- Wow... / - She eats so well.

1085
00:47:12,843 --> 00:47:13,443
I really can't tell.

1086
00:47:14,109 --> 00:47:17,176
- That's really hard. / - It was really delicious.

1087
00:47:20,376 --> 00:47:23,609
- The warm chewy noodles looks good. / - I'm salivating.

1088
00:47:24,076 --> 00:47:26,876
- The soup is so refreshing. / - I want to eat it again.

1089
00:47:26,876 --> 00:47:29,909
Which was better, warm or spicy?

1090
00:47:29,909 --> 00:47:32,443
- It's too hard to choose. / - Were both that good?

1091
00:47:32,443 --> 00:47:35,009
When you eat the warm, you crave the spicy.

1092
00:47:35,009 --> 00:47:37,109
Then you eat the spicy and crave the warm.

1093
00:47:37,109 --> 00:47:37,976
You need both.

1094
00:47:39,109 --> 00:47:41,376
We ate so much that it's embarrassing.

1095
00:47:42,309 --> 00:47:43,276
They're all empty.

1096
00:47:45,676 --> 00:47:47,709
The combination of the two dishes...

1097
00:47:47,709 --> 00:47:49,443
- Highly recommended. / - This is it.

1098
00:47:49,443 --> 00:47:51,343
Plus it's cheap.

1099
00:47:51,343 --> 00:47:52,943
- This is amazing. / - It is.

1100
00:47:52,943 --> 00:47:54,443
Business would boom if they opened this

1101
00:47:54,443 --> 00:47:54,976
near our agency.

1102
00:47:55,609 --> 00:47:56,643
Where do we go now?

1103
00:47:56,643 --> 00:47:57,943
Now that we've eaten...

1104
00:47:57,943 --> 00:47:59,543
- Let's take a walk. / - Okay.

1105
00:47:59,543 --> 00:48:01,743
Let's go take a look at the daytime streets of Silla.

1106
00:48:02,043 --> 00:48:03,976
What's Gyeongju famous for?

1107
00:48:03,976 --> 00:48:05,243
- Cheomseongdae. / - You're right.

1108
00:48:05,809 --> 00:48:08,443
Let's go to Cheomseongdae and Daereungwon.

1109
00:48:08,443 --> 00:48:09,243
That sounds great.

1110
00:48:09,843 --> 00:48:13,109
(Sujeong's daytime tour, walking the streets of Silla)

1111
00:48:13,109 --> 00:48:14,843
You need to digest your food by walking around.

1112
00:48:14,843 --> 00:48:15,876
Yeah, we should.

1113
00:48:16,243 --> 00:48:20,809
(20 minutes from the restaurant to Cheomseongdae)

1114
00:48:24,109 --> 00:48:26,509
- This is what Gyeongju's good for. / - Great weather.

1115
00:48:26,509 --> 00:48:27,743
The weather was great.

1116
00:48:27,743 --> 00:48:30,409
- We're here for the Silla daytime. / - Great weather.

1117
00:48:30,409 --> 00:48:32,443
- It's a huge park. / - Yeah.

1118
00:48:32,443 --> 00:48:33,976
I didn't know it was like this.

1119
00:48:33,976 --> 00:48:36,976
I thought it was just the Cheomseongdae here.

1120
00:48:36,976 --> 00:48:38,143
But it's an actual park.

1121
00:48:38,143 --> 00:48:39,809
- Check out the sky. / - It's well made here.

1122
00:48:39,809 --> 00:48:41,209
It really is.

1123
00:48:41,643 --> 00:48:44,209
Let's go see Cheomseongdae.

1124
00:48:44,209 --> 00:48:47,509
Because of the open view, I felt so refreshed.

1125
00:48:47,509 --> 00:48:49,476
- I can see it over there. / - Where?

1126
00:48:49,909 --> 00:48:52,143
- It's over there. / - It's quite small.

1127
00:48:52,809 --> 00:48:55,409
- Cheomseongdae. / - It's been so long.

1128
00:48:56,243 --> 00:48:59,209
I remember squatting here...

1129
00:48:59,209 --> 00:49:01,643
- For a group photo? / - And listened to the tour guide.

1130
00:49:01,643 --> 00:49:04,776
Many students went there for a field trip.

1131
00:49:04,776 --> 00:49:06,743
- Many kindergartners too. / - Many went there.

1132
00:49:06,743 --> 00:49:10,209
- Here? / - They assume it was an observatory.

1133
00:49:10,209 --> 00:49:12,076
I thought it was a fact.

1134
00:49:12,076 --> 00:49:14,343
But I was surprised that it's only an assumption.

1135
00:49:14,343 --> 00:49:16,309
How did they get in there?

1136
00:49:16,309 --> 00:49:17,909
They used a ladder over there.

1137
00:49:20,109 --> 00:49:22,643
It is open from 9 a.m.

1138
00:49:22,643 --> 00:49:25,743
- Do elementary students go there now? / - Yes.

1139
00:49:25,743 --> 00:49:27,543
I went there when I was in high school.

1140
00:49:29,609 --> 00:49:32,776
1, 2, 3.

1141
00:49:32,776 --> 00:49:33,009
So many kids.

1142
00:49:33,009 --> 00:49:34,709
- Is it a press conference? / - The kids were...

1143
00:49:34,709 --> 00:49:37,276
It was like a mini fan meeting.

1144
00:49:37,276 --> 00:49:40,476
(It's a must to take a picture at Cheomseongdae)

1145
00:49:40,476 --> 00:49:43,243
I don't think there were any fences in the past.

1146
00:49:43,243 --> 00:49:44,176
- You're right. / - Right?

1147
00:49:44,176 --> 00:49:46,043
- There was no grass either. / - Really?

1148
00:49:46,043 --> 00:49:48,076
- It has changed a lot. / - It has.

1149
00:49:48,843 --> 00:49:51,243
I once came here with my parents at night.

1150
00:49:51,243 --> 00:49:52,343
Is it beautiful at night?

1151
00:49:52,343 --> 00:49:54,443
Yes. Cheomseongdae is gorgeous at night.

1152
00:49:54,443 --> 00:49:56,843
Since it's better at night, let's come again at night.

1153
00:49:56,843 --> 00:49:59,409
- Let's come here again. / - Let's return at night.

1154
00:49:59,409 --> 00:50:01,809
- And move on to the next place. / - Let's go.

1155
00:50:01,809 --> 00:50:03,543
Let's go.

1156
00:50:08,976 --> 00:50:10,609
(Daereungwon is opposite to Cheomseongdae)

1157
00:50:10,609 --> 00:50:12,776
It's really close from Cheomseongdae to Daereungwon.

1158
00:50:12,776 --> 00:50:14,276
You can just walk across.

1159
00:50:15,076 --> 00:50:17,376
Yein, can you read that?

1160
00:50:17,376 --> 00:50:20,309
Due to the remodeling of Cheonmachong,

1161
00:50:20,309 --> 00:50:22,909
the admission to Daereungwon is free of charge.

1162
00:50:22,909 --> 00:50:24,843
It's sad we can't see Cheonmachong though.

1163
00:50:24,843 --> 00:50:26,509
- It's free until April next year. / - Since it's free...

1164
00:50:26,509 --> 00:50:30,076
Please feel free to come here and enjoy it.

1165
00:50:30,076 --> 00:50:31,809
This place... I love it.

1166
00:50:31,809 --> 00:50:33,909
- I like it. / - I love it.

1167
00:50:33,909 --> 00:50:35,876
I love it, I love it.

1168
00:50:37,676 --> 00:50:39,876
It really is a healing place.

1169
00:50:39,876 --> 00:50:40,909
Everyone.

1170
00:50:40,909 --> 00:50:42,643
What do we do?

1171
00:50:42,643 --> 00:50:44,976
It was like breathing in lots of pure oxygen.

1172
00:50:44,976 --> 00:50:46,143
- What do we do? / - Phytoncide.

1173
00:50:46,143 --> 00:50:49,376
(There are 23 royal and noble tombs of Silla)

1174
00:50:49,376 --> 00:50:50,576
It was so pretty.

1175
00:50:51,976 --> 00:50:54,176
- It relaxes you. / - It does.

1176
00:50:56,909 --> 00:50:59,043
There weren't many people that day.

1177
00:50:59,043 --> 00:51:00,776
So it was very relaxing.

1178
00:51:00,776 --> 00:51:02,143
There's lots of shade too.

1179
00:51:03,009 --> 00:51:05,343
Yein, I like this place so much.

1180
00:51:05,343 --> 00:51:06,776
I love this place!

1181
00:51:07,509 --> 00:51:09,243
They suddenly became dolphins.

1182
00:51:12,009 --> 00:51:13,776
How happy must they be?

1183
00:51:15,776 --> 00:51:18,143
Is that a willow tree?

1184
00:51:18,143 --> 00:51:20,276
My name means a willow tree.

1185
00:51:21,176 --> 00:51:22,643
Do you want me to take a picture of you?

1186
00:51:22,643 --> 00:51:24,076
- Yes, I do. / - Which tree do you mean?

1187
00:51:24,609 --> 00:51:26,276
Make a nice pose.

1188
00:51:27,343 --> 00:51:29,043
You look like a fairy. 1, 2, 3.

1189
00:51:29,576 --> 00:51:31,043
Here you go. 1, 2, 3.

1190
00:51:32,976 --> 00:51:34,443
Here you go. 1, 2, 3.

1191
00:51:34,909 --> 00:51:36,176
Here you go. 1, 2, 3.

1192
00:51:36,209 --> 00:51:38,376
The pictures turn out really pretty there.

1193
00:51:38,376 --> 00:51:40,343
- The deer. / - Our deer...

1194
00:51:40,343 --> 00:51:41,543
She's bending a lot.

1195
00:51:41,543 --> 00:51:44,176
- They look like small hills. / - Yes.

1196
00:51:44,176 --> 00:51:46,776
- There are so many tombs. / - They're like small hills.

1197
00:51:46,776 --> 00:51:49,243
There are many fruits in the trees.

1198
00:51:49,243 --> 00:51:51,176
If it's too tough to walk,

1199
00:51:51,176 --> 00:51:53,609
you can take breaks on benches along the way.

1200
00:51:53,609 --> 00:51:56,909
- You can take it slow in Gyeongju. / - Exactly.

1201
00:51:57,509 --> 00:52:00,609
- Right. / - There's a pond over there.

1202
00:52:00,609 --> 00:52:02,343
I think there are lotus flowers.

1203
00:52:02,343 --> 00:52:04,443
- That was so pretty too. / - It's not crowded on weekdays.

1204
00:52:04,443 --> 00:52:06,176
- No, it's not. / - It was not crowded.

1205
00:52:07,476 --> 00:52:10,509
There is even a pond in this fascinating scene.

1206
00:52:10,509 --> 00:52:12,643
- I know. / - It's so beautiful.

1207
00:52:12,643 --> 00:52:15,009
- It's gorgeous. / - And the weather is great.

1208
00:52:15,676 --> 00:52:16,943
It's nice.

1209
00:52:16,943 --> 00:52:19,876
Sujeong, it's a little hot.

1210
00:52:20,809 --> 00:52:23,009
Can we go eat some ice cream?

1211
00:52:23,009 --> 00:52:25,009
- We'll go eat some ice cream. / - Okay.

1212
00:52:25,009 --> 00:52:27,343
Do you know what is fantastic about Gyeongju?

1213
00:52:27,343 --> 00:52:30,409
We just walked here from Cheomseongdae

1214
00:52:30,409 --> 00:52:31,276
and you know what?

1215
00:52:31,276 --> 00:52:32,376
Hwangridangil is just over there.

1216
00:52:32,809 --> 00:52:34,509
- We can just walk there to eat it. / - Let's go quickly.

1217
00:52:34,509 --> 00:52:36,076
- Let's go now. / - Hwangridangil?

1218
00:52:36,076 --> 00:52:38,343
- Yes. / - It's a street that became...

1219
00:52:38,343 --> 00:52:41,409
Trendy recently in Gyeongju.

1220
00:52:42,676 --> 00:52:46,909
(Hwangridangil is located in front of Daereungwon)

1221
00:52:48,576 --> 00:52:50,509
(It recently became the street of the youth)

1222
00:52:50,509 --> 00:52:53,943
- There are a lot of cafes. / - And good restaurants.

1223
00:52:53,943 --> 00:52:55,509
What is that?

1224
00:52:55,509 --> 00:52:56,143
(Hwangridangil)

1225
00:52:56,143 --> 00:53:00,209
(Unique shops have been drawing in the youth)

1226
00:53:01,276 --> 00:53:03,376
- The shade is so refreshing. / - It's so cool.

1227
00:53:03,376 --> 00:53:06,543
We just enjoyed the daytime in Silla.

1228
00:53:06,543 --> 00:53:09,476
It's time to enjoy the daytime of Gyeongju.

1229
00:53:09,476 --> 00:53:10,543
So hot, so hot.

1230
00:53:10,543 --> 00:53:14,476
Yein, we're finally going to have some ice cream.

1231
00:53:14,476 --> 00:53:16,309
- The store is so pretty. / - Pretty.

1232
00:53:16,309 --> 00:53:18,676
- Let's go. / - It's very pink.

1233
00:53:18,676 --> 00:53:20,343
You have to drop by.

1234
00:53:20,943 --> 00:53:25,943
(Ice cream parlor at the entrance of Hwangridangil)

1235
00:53:27,076 --> 00:53:28,309
What are these?

1236
00:53:29,109 --> 00:53:32,276
They're popsicles.

1237
00:53:32,276 --> 00:53:34,309
What is this Couque D'asse option?

1238
00:53:35,409 --> 00:53:37,309
Cone made of Couque D'asse.

1239
00:53:37,309 --> 00:53:38,743
- I want that one. / - Me too.

1240
00:53:38,743 --> 00:53:41,109
The Couque D'asse cone was really good.

1241
00:53:41,109 --> 00:53:42,976
The cone is made with Couque D'asse cookies.

1242
00:53:42,976 --> 00:53:45,609
- Really? / - It's so good.

1243
00:53:45,609 --> 00:53:47,943
- He's so generous. / - Couque D'asse cones.

1244
00:53:49,643 --> 00:53:51,076
Thank you.

1245
00:53:51,076 --> 00:53:53,609
(Organic ice cream, $4.50)

1246
00:53:56,943 --> 00:53:57,943
Sujeong.

1247
00:53:59,509 --> 00:54:01,443
- That's so... Wow. / - That looks good.

1248
00:54:01,443 --> 00:54:03,143
- It's really good. / - Why are you crying?

1249
00:54:03,443 --> 00:54:04,476
How can it be this good?

1250
00:54:04,476 --> 00:54:06,109
It's so tasty.

1251
00:54:06,109 --> 00:54:07,876
It's the best. It's seriously good.

1252
00:54:07,876 --> 00:54:09,543
- Is it better because of the heat? / - I think so.

1253
00:54:09,543 --> 00:54:11,643
Everyone, just walk here.

1254
00:54:11,643 --> 00:54:13,376
- It's so good. / - It is.

1255
00:54:13,376 --> 00:54:14,376
I should have one more.

1256
00:54:15,076 --> 00:54:16,076
As expected.

1257
00:54:24,209 --> 00:54:27,976
(They enjoy delicious soft serve after walking about)

1258
00:54:28,876 --> 00:54:30,909
I can't help myself. I need one more.

1259
00:54:30,909 --> 00:54:32,209
Me too.

1260
00:54:33,376 --> 00:54:35,776
- I feel much better now. / - Me too.

1261
00:54:37,909 --> 00:54:40,709
This place is so picturesque.

1262
00:54:40,709 --> 00:54:42,643
I think "La La Land" has to be filmed here.

1263
00:54:42,643 --> 00:54:44,576
This place...

1264
00:54:44,576 --> 00:54:46,076
It's so pretty here.

1265
00:54:47,709 --> 00:54:49,643
Is Hwangridangil very long?

1266
00:54:49,643 --> 00:54:52,809
It's about 1km long.

1267
00:54:52,809 --> 00:54:55,476
If you just stroll along, you'll reach the end in no time.

1268
00:54:56,343 --> 00:54:58,576
If we go a bit further,

1269
00:54:58,576 --> 00:55:00,509
there's a black and white photo studio.

1270
00:55:00,509 --> 00:55:02,176
They're trending these days.

1271
00:55:02,676 --> 00:55:04,076
Should we take a photo since

1272
00:55:04,076 --> 00:55:04,943
we're wearing matching outfits?

1273
00:55:04,943 --> 00:55:05,776
Sure.

1274
00:55:06,543 --> 00:55:08,243
There's the studio.

1275
00:55:08,243 --> 00:55:10,676
The exterior is so pretty.

1276
00:55:10,676 --> 00:55:12,443
It's so pretty. It feels old school.

1277
00:55:12,443 --> 00:55:13,643
- Shall we go inside? / - Let's head inside.

1278
00:55:17,909 --> 00:55:20,776
- It's a black and white photo studio. / - What's this?

1279
00:55:20,776 --> 00:55:23,776
The photos are black and white.

1280
00:55:23,776 --> 00:55:25,676
The developing takes about 20 minutes.

1281
00:55:25,676 --> 00:55:28,276
- They use old cameras. / - You'll need some leisure time.

1282
00:55:28,276 --> 00:55:31,076
The interior is decorated like an old photo studio.

1283
00:55:31,076 --> 00:55:33,543
(4 prints cost $30)

1284
00:55:36,543 --> 00:55:37,609
Is this a wedding shoot?

1285
00:55:40,409 --> 00:55:42,376
(Being affectionate)

1286
00:55:46,543 --> 00:55:51,176
(They show off a flurry of idol beauty)

1287
00:55:52,476 --> 00:55:55,243
The photographer directed us.

1288
00:55:55,243 --> 00:55:56,376
"Face each other and smile."

1289
00:55:56,376 --> 00:55:57,209
"Place one leg back."

1290
00:55:57,209 --> 00:55:59,843
- That's how we did it. / - He told us what to do.

1291
00:55:59,843 --> 00:56:01,643
They're album-worthy.

1292
00:56:01,643 --> 00:56:03,543
- That came out so well. / - They come out pretty.

1293
00:56:03,543 --> 00:56:05,009
It's like a jacket photo.

1294
00:56:07,976 --> 00:56:08,976
It's so pretty.

1295
00:56:09,476 --> 00:56:10,643
I love them.

1296
00:56:11,909 --> 00:56:13,143
Our other members will be so envious.

1297
00:56:14,476 --> 00:56:17,143
Let's all come and take jacket pictures here next time.

1298
00:56:17,143 --> 00:56:18,443
Let's take a picture together.

1299
00:56:18,776 --> 00:56:19,309
Let's go.

1300
00:56:19,309 --> 00:56:21,543
- Good-bye. / - Good-bye.

1301
00:56:21,543 --> 00:56:24,009
The cafe that we're heading to is

1302
00:56:24,009 --> 00:56:27,076
located in an alleyway.

1303
00:56:27,076 --> 00:56:29,109
- It's in an alleyway? / - It's so peaceful.

1304
00:56:29,109 --> 00:56:30,909
I love cozy cafes like that.

1305
00:56:30,909 --> 00:56:32,476
Where is it? Do you know how to find it?

1306
00:56:32,476 --> 00:56:33,809
Of course. Here it is.

1307
00:56:33,809 --> 00:56:35,309
- It's so pretty. / - To get there...

1308
00:56:35,309 --> 00:56:38,109
You just need to enter the alleyway.

1309
00:56:38,109 --> 00:56:41,743
- I wanted to visit a cafe like this. / - Amazing.

1310
00:56:42,309 --> 00:56:43,843
Alright. Let's head inside.

1311
00:56:46,109 --> 00:56:50,043
(It was renovated from a traditional Korean house)

1312
00:56:50,043 --> 00:56:54,743
(You can experience a uniquely Korean feel)

1313
00:57:04,976 --> 00:57:06,676
- So pretty. / - But there's an age restriction?

1314
00:57:06,676 --> 00:57:09,409
Yes, to help maintain a quiet atmosphere,

1315
00:57:09,409 --> 00:57:12,409
they don't admit children under 13 years of age.

1316
00:57:12,409 --> 00:57:14,743
I guess Seoeon and Seojun can't go.

1317
00:57:14,743 --> 00:57:17,343
Well, we avoid places like that too.

1318
00:57:17,343 --> 00:57:18,576
We don't want to be a nuisance.

1319
00:57:18,576 --> 00:57:21,809
It's a great place to enjoy a leisurely mood.

1320
00:57:21,809 --> 00:57:26,543
- The cafe is a traditional house. / - I know.

1321
00:57:26,543 --> 00:57:29,176
Everyone converses in a hushed tone here.

1322
00:57:29,176 --> 00:57:30,676
You can hardly hear chatter.

1323
00:57:32,043 --> 00:57:34,309
- Or embroider something. / - I know.

1324
00:57:34,309 --> 00:57:35,943
- Thank you. / - Thank you.

1325
00:57:35,943 --> 00:57:37,509
- It's bean flour rice cake. / - I'm excited.

1326
00:57:38,443 --> 00:57:40,076
Didn't you just have dessert?

1327
00:57:40,076 --> 00:57:41,443
Well, this is uniquely Korean.

1328
00:57:41,443 --> 00:57:43,043
We wanted to show you a variety.

1329
00:57:43,043 --> 00:57:44,476
Don't forget to take a picture.

1330
00:57:44,543 --> 00:57:47,976
(Multi-colored bean flour rice cake, $8.50)

1331
00:57:47,976 --> 00:57:48,576
(Omija tea, $9.50)

1332
00:57:48,576 --> 00:57:50,743
- It's so pretty. / - It really is.

1333
00:57:54,709 --> 00:57:55,343
What do we do?

1334
00:57:56,176 --> 00:57:57,576
My goodness.

1335
00:57:58,243 --> 00:58:00,676
My gosh. You really ate to your hearts' content.

1336
00:58:00,676 --> 00:58:02,309
We really ate a lot.

1337
00:58:02,309 --> 00:58:03,343
Shall we?

1338
00:58:03,609 --> 00:58:04,609
Cheers.

1339
00:58:05,976 --> 00:58:09,409
(She takes a sip of the cool omija tea first)

1340
00:58:09,409 --> 00:58:10,676
How can it be so tasty?

1341
00:58:11,109 --> 00:58:12,976
Drinking this makes you feel elegant.

1342
00:58:17,376 --> 00:58:21,009
(She just might fall into the cup)

1343
00:58:21,009 --> 00:58:22,143
Why does that tea...

1344
00:58:23,643 --> 00:58:25,476
Why does that look like a bowl of warm chewy noodles?

1345
00:58:27,209 --> 00:58:28,843
I think I can finish it in one go.

1346
00:58:30,143 --> 00:58:31,609
Sujeong really knows how to eat.

1347
00:58:33,376 --> 00:58:36,176
- It's so pretty. / - The snow shapes...

1348
00:58:36,176 --> 00:58:38,343
They're made with pears.

1349
00:58:38,343 --> 00:58:39,743
The decoration is important.

1350
00:58:41,509 --> 00:58:42,909
How can it be so tasty?

1351
00:58:46,543 --> 00:58:47,809
Please try a bite.

1352
00:58:51,576 --> 00:58:52,576
Isn't it good?

1353
00:58:53,876 --> 00:58:55,743
- What's with this? / - It's so good.

1354
00:58:56,509 --> 00:58:58,443
There were whole pieces of wild strawberries.

1355
00:58:58,443 --> 00:58:59,876
It's so good.

1356
00:58:59,876 --> 00:59:00,943
It's so good.

1357
00:59:02,076 --> 00:59:03,209
It's seriously good.

1358
00:59:03,209 --> 00:59:05,609
- What are those? / - They're wild strawberries.

1359
00:59:05,609 --> 00:59:08,709
Usually, wild strawberries are sour but those weren't.

1360
00:59:08,709 --> 00:59:10,943
- Let's try the bean flour rice cake. / - Let's try it.

1361
00:59:12,243 --> 00:59:13,576
It was honey and not soy sauce.

1362
00:59:13,576 --> 00:59:16,109
- It must be grain syrup. / - My goodness.

1363
00:59:16,109 --> 00:59:17,176
That looks really good.

1364
00:59:17,176 --> 00:59:18,809
That was so good.

1365
00:59:18,809 --> 00:59:20,209
You really ate good stuff.

1366
00:59:22,176 --> 00:59:23,909
Can you see the honey dripping?

1367
00:59:24,443 --> 00:59:26,909
- They were grilled. / - Yes, grilled.

1368
00:59:28,543 --> 00:59:29,543
It's so good.

1369
00:59:29,543 --> 00:59:31,509
The colors were so pretty too.

1370
00:59:31,509 --> 00:59:33,409
- The flavors differed too. / - That's so...

1371
00:59:33,409 --> 00:59:35,909
"Good-looking rice cakes are always tasty", they say.

1372
00:59:36,543 --> 00:59:39,443
Well, that saying came true just now.

1373
00:59:39,443 --> 00:59:42,509
- So, they come heated on a stone. / - Yes.

1374
00:59:42,509 --> 00:59:44,076
Amazing.

1375
00:59:44,076 --> 00:59:45,509
It's nice that it's relaxing here.

1376
00:59:45,509 --> 00:59:47,343
Of course the food is good.

1377
00:59:47,343 --> 00:59:50,143
- But I love the leisurely vibe. / - True.

1378
00:59:50,143 --> 00:59:51,343
And the breeze is perfect.

1379
00:59:51,343 --> 00:59:52,809
The weather was on point.

1380
00:59:52,809 --> 00:59:55,843
The sunlight was just enough as well as the wind.

1381
00:59:55,843 --> 00:59:57,809
- It's first-rate weather. / - It was really nice.

1382
00:59:57,809 --> 01:00:00,709
- That's when it's the best. / - I don't want to go back.

1383
01:00:00,709 --> 01:00:03,976
- That's what happens on trips. / - I know.

1384
01:00:03,976 --> 01:00:04,976
It was such a shame we had to leave.

1385
01:00:05,643 --> 01:00:07,443
- I wish I could stay longer. / - I don't want to go.

1386
01:00:07,909 --> 01:00:09,343
I'm not leaving.

1387
01:00:11,076 --> 01:00:13,976
(After a while, the sun begins to set)

1388
01:00:13,976 --> 01:00:15,976
The sun is beginning to set.

1389
01:00:15,976 --> 01:00:18,643
- It's evening, your time. / - My time.

1390
01:00:18,643 --> 01:00:19,643
Night time.

1391
01:00:19,643 --> 01:00:21,476
So, what will we be eating for dinner?

1392
01:00:22,043 --> 01:00:23,143
Well, for dinner...

1393
01:00:23,443 --> 01:00:25,743
Just follow me. We'll be eating meat.

1394
01:00:25,876 --> 01:00:28,109
You ate a lot. Is there room left?

1395
01:00:28,109 --> 01:00:31,109
There are separate stomachs for desserts and meals.

1396
01:00:31,109 --> 01:00:32,209
That's great.

1397
01:00:32,643 --> 01:00:34,743
(Yein's Evening Trip)

1398
01:00:34,743 --> 01:00:38,609
(Enjoying the sunset on a hot-air balloon)

1399
01:00:38,609 --> 01:00:42,209
- Let's do more research on the trip. / - This one!

1400
01:00:42,209 --> 01:00:44,243
A hot-air balloon? That's a good idea.

1401
01:00:44,243 --> 01:00:49,243
This is Soul's recommended Gyeongju destinations.

1402
01:00:49,243 --> 01:00:50,476
Hot-air balloon.

1403
01:00:50,476 --> 01:00:52,609
With 8 trip designers, there's so much variety.

1404
01:00:52,609 --> 01:00:55,709
- It's my first time. / - We must go there.

1405
01:00:55,876 --> 01:01:00,243
(It takes 20 minutes by car to get to the launch site)

1406
01:01:00,243 --> 01:01:02,309
We'll be riding a hot-air balloon.

1407
01:01:02,309 --> 01:01:04,776
But it's not propelled by heat.

1408
01:01:04,776 --> 01:01:07,509
It actually goes up using helium.

1409
01:01:07,509 --> 01:01:09,309
- So, it's not a hot-air balloon. / - That's right.

1410
01:01:09,309 --> 01:01:11,309
They don't operate it under windy conditions.

1411
01:01:11,309 --> 01:01:14,343
So, it's best to find out by calling in advance.

1412
01:01:16,009 --> 01:01:17,909
(With a max height of 150m)

1413
01:01:17,909 --> 01:01:20,709
(It can accommodate up to 30 people)

1414
01:01:22,076 --> 01:01:25,043
(You can get a bird's-eye view of Bomun Lake)

1415
01:01:25,043 --> 01:01:26,043
(And a panoramic view of Gyeongju itself)

1416
01:01:26,043 --> 01:01:28,076
It went up higher than I expected.

1417
01:01:28,909 --> 01:01:32,476
- We'll be viewing the sunset. / - Let's go.

1418
01:01:38,643 --> 01:01:41,176
(Then shall we go up?)

1419
01:01:42,909 --> 01:01:44,476
(Off we go)

1420
01:01:44,476 --> 01:01:46,243
We're going up.

1421
01:01:46,243 --> 01:01:47,643
It's like I've become the helicam.

1422
01:01:49,376 --> 01:01:50,343
That's very high.

1423
01:01:50,343 --> 01:01:53,576
- It went up higher than expected. / - It goes up high.

1424
01:01:53,576 --> 01:01:55,276
- Cars look like toys from here. / - It does go up slowly.

1425
01:01:56,043 --> 01:01:58,576
- You're not scared of heights then? / - No.

1426
01:02:02,443 --> 01:02:03,509
It's like a movie.

1427
01:02:04,043 --> 01:02:06,643
There are safety nets all around

1428
01:02:06,643 --> 01:02:08,243
so it's safe for children too.

1429
01:02:10,209 --> 01:02:12,309
But it goes up much higher than expected.

1430
01:02:13,443 --> 01:02:15,209
Gosh. It's so scary right here.

1431
01:02:15,209 --> 01:02:16,076
Is the center hollow?

1432
01:02:16,076 --> 01:02:18,309
Yes, so it's quite scary. The center is scary.

1433
01:02:20,143 --> 01:02:21,043
You're right.

1434
01:02:21,043 --> 01:02:23,209
It's scarier here.

1435
01:02:23,209 --> 01:02:24,576
(The view makes you come to terms with the height)

1436
01:02:25,676 --> 01:02:26,676
It's deeper.

1437
01:02:31,876 --> 01:02:33,609
She kept scaring me.

1438
01:02:34,776 --> 01:02:37,909
- Gosh. / - She almost cried.

1439
01:02:37,909 --> 01:02:38,909
That was really scary.

1440
01:02:44,943 --> 01:02:47,776
I almost dropped the camera.

1441
01:02:50,176 --> 01:02:51,876
- Success. / - My hands have gone limp.

1442
01:02:53,243 --> 01:02:54,609
This is so funny.

1443
01:02:54,609 --> 01:02:56,509
Isn't Sujeong so cute?

1444
01:02:59,309 --> 01:03:02,743
- As you rise up... / - So pretty.

1445
01:03:02,743 --> 01:03:04,509
The sun goes down and the colors are so pretty.

1446
01:03:04,509 --> 01:03:07,509
- Our leader recommended it. / - That's right.

1447
01:03:07,509 --> 01:03:09,209
This is the hot-air balloon.

1448
01:03:09,209 --> 01:03:11,076
Gyeongju itself is beautiful.

1449
01:03:11,076 --> 01:03:13,609
How great must it be to see it from up there.

1450
01:03:13,609 --> 01:03:14,343
It was so pretty.

1451
01:03:15,676 --> 01:03:16,943
I miss our members.

1452
01:03:16,943 --> 01:03:19,209
It would be so much fun with all eight of us here.

1453
01:03:19,209 --> 01:03:21,376
It would be so refreshing.

1454
01:03:21,943 --> 01:03:23,576
Our dear members.

1455
01:03:23,576 --> 01:03:26,476
I missed you more being at such a beautiful place.

1456
01:03:26,476 --> 01:03:29,309
After being in a big group...

1457
01:03:29,309 --> 01:03:30,909
- I miss you. / - We missed them.

1458
01:03:30,909 --> 01:03:32,309
Let's come back together.

1459
01:03:35,576 --> 01:03:38,743
(They break away from their busy routine)

1460
01:03:38,743 --> 01:03:41,843
(And enjoy their moments in Gyeongju)

1461
01:03:41,843 --> 01:03:43,109
It's so serene.

1462
01:03:43,109 --> 01:03:44,109
Helicam.

1463
01:03:45,876 --> 01:03:48,643
- Hello. / - Hello.

1464
01:03:50,243 --> 01:03:57,609
(For now, they enjoy the leisure)

1465
01:04:00,176 --> 01:04:03,809
Once you go up, you can look around for 15 minutes.

1466
01:04:03,809 --> 01:04:05,076
- It's plenty of time. / - Plenty of time.

1467
01:04:06,443 --> 01:04:09,109
- It's so pretty. / - Hey, Yein.

1468
01:04:09,109 --> 01:04:11,209
The fresh air is making me hungry.

1469
01:04:12,176 --> 01:04:13,676
Breathing is exhausting.

1470
01:04:14,309 --> 01:04:16,509
- I'm getting hungry. / - Really?

1471
01:04:16,509 --> 01:04:20,009
Well, then that means we have to go eat.

1472
01:04:20,009 --> 01:04:23,109
Let's go eat meat. Trust me and follow along.

1473
01:04:23,109 --> 01:04:25,376
- Let's go eat meat. / - Let's go.

1474
01:04:25,376 --> 01:04:26,943
Let's go on the hot-air balloon.

1475
01:04:27,909 --> 01:04:30,576
It would be amazing if we could land there.

1476
01:04:31,076 --> 01:04:33,709
(Yein's Evening Trip, Snow braised ribs)

1477
01:04:33,709 --> 01:04:36,043
- It's ribs time. / - We're heading to go eat now.

1478
01:04:36,576 --> 01:04:39,809
(It takes about 15 minutes to get there by car)

1479
01:04:40,943 --> 01:04:42,709
Where are we going, Yein?

1480
01:04:42,709 --> 01:04:44,376
We're off to get some ribs.

1481
01:04:44,376 --> 01:04:45,909
Oh, my God.

1482
01:04:45,909 --> 01:04:48,109
Apparently, they sprinkle snow on top.

1483
01:04:48,109 --> 01:04:49,109
What's the white snow?

1484
01:04:51,376 --> 01:04:53,443
What's that?

1485
01:04:53,443 --> 01:04:56,376
- What is that? / - That's the snow I mentioned.

1486
01:04:56,976 --> 01:05:01,109
(Have you heard of snow braised ribs?)

1487
01:05:04,109 --> 01:05:05,843
Oh, wow!

1488
01:05:05,843 --> 01:05:08,743
This is insane!

1489
01:05:10,309 --> 01:05:12,609
It seems like an antique shop in here.

1490
01:05:12,609 --> 01:05:15,276
I know. Look around us.

1491
01:05:15,276 --> 01:05:17,143
Check out the paintings.

1492
01:05:17,143 --> 01:05:18,443
There are crowns.

1493
01:05:18,443 --> 01:05:21,476
- And the ceiling... / - It's all in Chinese.

1494
01:05:22,209 --> 01:05:23,243
No way to understand.

1495
01:05:26,276 --> 01:05:27,476
They're wise sayings.

1496
01:05:28,809 --> 01:05:30,376
Can you read Chinese characters?

1497
01:05:30,376 --> 01:05:31,509
- Chinese characters? / - Yes.

1498
01:05:32,543 --> 01:05:33,543
Of course.

1499
01:05:34,376 --> 01:05:35,309
(Grinning)

1500
01:05:35,609 --> 01:05:37,709
- I can't read any of them. / - Me too.

1501
01:05:39,076 --> 01:05:40,076
I forgot all of them...

1502
01:05:40,076 --> 01:05:40,776
- From elementary school. / - It's okay.

1503
01:05:40,776 --> 01:05:42,076
The menu's in Korean.

1504
01:05:43,109 --> 01:05:47,343
We'll have the snow braised ribs.

1505
01:05:47,343 --> 01:05:49,943
- Let's also order the green plum wine. / - Okay.

1506
01:05:49,943 --> 01:05:52,176
- Plum wine? / - Yes, we have some.

1507
01:05:52,176 --> 01:05:53,743
1 bottle please.

1508
01:06:00,176 --> 01:06:01,943
The wine is here. It's here.

1509
01:06:01,943 --> 01:06:02,743
- The wine is here. / - It's here.

1510
01:06:02,743 --> 01:06:04,843
There are actual plums in it.

1511
01:06:04,843 --> 01:06:06,143
Do you have to shake?

1512
01:06:07,209 --> 01:06:10,043
(A 20-year-old shaking up her wine)

1513
01:06:10,043 --> 01:06:11,376
That's soju.

1514
01:06:12,243 --> 01:06:13,576
That's soju.

1515
01:06:15,109 --> 01:06:17,109
It's okay to shake.

1516
01:06:18,876 --> 01:06:20,209
You need to shake it that much?

1517
01:06:21,343 --> 01:06:22,609
The tornado didn't work.

1518
01:06:25,976 --> 01:06:27,043
(Struggling)

1519
01:06:29,209 --> 01:06:30,543
(I want to drink it quickly)

1520
01:06:30,543 --> 01:06:31,776
Hand it over.

1521
01:06:31,776 --> 01:06:34,243
(Let's drink now)

1522
01:06:34,243 --> 01:06:35,143
You can do it.

1523
01:06:35,643 --> 01:06:38,076
(Did you see that?)

1524
01:06:39,509 --> 01:06:40,709
Fascinating.

1525
01:06:42,543 --> 01:06:43,976
Thank you.

1526
01:06:43,976 --> 01:06:45,676
Hey, Sujeong. Here's toast for Lovelyz.

1527
01:06:45,676 --> 01:06:46,676
Let's win.

1528
01:06:48,609 --> 01:06:52,176
(Forget savoring it, just drink up)

1529
01:06:52,176 --> 01:06:54,209
- She drinks well. / - She does.

1530
01:06:54,209 --> 01:06:55,543
Being a girl group...

1531
01:06:56,076 --> 01:06:57,243
It's out.

1532
01:06:59,876 --> 01:07:02,076
Isn't that meant for dim sum?

1533
01:07:02,076 --> 01:07:04,043
- Look forward to it. / - The visuals.

1534
01:07:05,409 --> 01:07:07,976
- I'm so excited. / - So excited.

1535
01:07:07,976 --> 01:07:10,243
- I'm so excited. / - I'm opening it.

1536
01:07:10,243 --> 01:07:11,309
Here we go.

1537
01:07:11,309 --> 01:07:13,609
(The big reveal)

1538
01:07:13,843 --> 01:07:14,876
Here we go.

1539
01:07:19,243 --> 01:07:21,309
- That looks good. / - What is that?

1540
01:07:21,309 --> 01:07:22,743
- The pumpkin is good too. / - I've never...

1541
01:07:22,743 --> 01:07:23,643
Seen that before.

1542
01:07:25,543 --> 01:07:27,176
(The braised ribs are covered in snow)

1543
01:07:31,676 --> 01:07:34,243
- What do we do? / - Amazing beef ribs.

1544
01:07:34,243 --> 01:07:35,509
It looks so good.

1545
01:07:37,943 --> 01:07:39,609
What do you think this is?

1546
01:07:39,609 --> 01:07:40,843
It's not rice.

1547
01:07:43,109 --> 01:07:46,009
(What's the identity of this white substance?)

1548
01:07:46,009 --> 01:07:47,043
It's glutinous rice, Yein.

1549
01:07:55,443 --> 01:07:56,809
- It's glutinous rice, right? / - Yes.

1550
01:07:56,809 --> 01:07:59,043
So you don't need to order rice.

1551
01:07:59,043 --> 01:08:02,976
It's chewier than normal rice, so it was tasty.

1552
01:08:02,976 --> 01:08:05,109
- There's sweet potato too. / - Really?

1553
01:08:05,109 --> 01:08:07,576
- It has 3 to 4 layers. / - Like this.

1554
01:08:07,576 --> 01:08:09,043
It was layered.

1555
01:08:10,009 --> 01:08:12,943
- It was so good. / - Don't forget our ribs, everyone.

1556
01:08:14,443 --> 01:08:16,143
(First layer, sweet potatoes)

1557
01:08:16,143 --> 01:08:18,676
(Second layer, short ribs)

1558
01:08:18,676 --> 01:08:23,376
It wasn't oily either.

1559
01:08:23,376 --> 01:08:25,009
It's very tender and flavorful.

1560
01:08:25,576 --> 01:08:28,443
(The dish is aesthetically fantastic)

1561
01:08:31,043 --> 01:08:33,276
- This is game over. / - This is so!

1562
01:08:33,276 --> 01:08:34,743
What do we do about this?

1563
01:08:36,576 --> 01:08:37,643
I'm so happy.

1564
01:08:38,109 --> 01:08:39,609
Let's try a rib now.

1565
01:08:39,609 --> 01:08:40,609
Cheers.

1566
01:08:40,943 --> 01:08:43,943
(They finally take a bite)

1567
01:08:43,943 --> 01:08:45,376
Hot, hot, hot.

1568
01:08:46,576 --> 01:08:48,376
- Be careful. / - I thought my teeth were burning.

1569
01:08:58,543 --> 01:09:00,109
It's so good

1570
01:09:00,109 --> 01:09:01,509
That's right. You need to twist it off.

1571
01:09:01,809 --> 01:09:03,609
I feel like I'm watching myself at 20.

1572
01:09:05,443 --> 01:09:06,643
It's so good.

1573
01:09:07,776 --> 01:09:09,809
I imagined something stickier.

1574
01:09:09,809 --> 01:09:12,543
But you get a taste of the meat more than the sauce.

1575
01:09:12,543 --> 01:09:13,543
Right.

1576
01:09:13,543 --> 01:09:16,476
And the glutinous rice is really chewy.

1577
01:09:16,476 --> 01:09:19,076
It makes me feel like I'm enjoying it with rice.

1578
01:09:19,076 --> 01:09:20,009
You're right.

1579
01:09:25,443 --> 01:09:26,409
Hey, Yein.

1580
01:09:29,676 --> 01:09:31,576
- Tastes good. / - "Hey, Yein" means "let's drink."

1581
01:09:32,609 --> 01:09:33,609
Hey, Yein.

1582
01:09:36,309 --> 01:09:38,076
Sujeong always drinks bottoms up.

1583
01:09:38,076 --> 01:09:39,076
It was so good.

1584
01:09:39,076 --> 01:09:41,843
This plum wine is so good.

1585
01:09:42,809 --> 01:09:45,576
Sujeong, that's not soda.

1586
01:09:45,576 --> 01:09:47,476
It's not soda, okay.

1587
01:09:49,876 --> 01:09:51,243
(And the eating show begins)

1588
01:09:51,243 --> 01:09:55,476
- Seriously, we kept eating. / - The bones piled up.

1589
01:09:55,743 --> 01:09:56,743
Flip it around.

1590
01:09:58,376 --> 01:10:00,676
The kitchen is run by mothers.

1591
01:10:00,676 --> 01:10:03,609
- The side dishes were so tasty. / - They were.

1592
01:10:11,643 --> 01:10:13,209
- We're done. / - We ate it all.

1593
01:10:14,876 --> 01:10:16,609
(Feeling sad)

1594
01:10:16,609 --> 01:10:19,809
The viewers will be shocked that we ate so much.

1595
01:10:19,809 --> 01:10:20,843
We scraped it clean.

1596
01:10:22,376 --> 01:10:24,176
It's embarrassing.

1597
01:10:24,176 --> 01:10:26,143
We really wanted to order another one.

1598
01:10:26,143 --> 01:10:28,076
- But due to the budget... / - We couldn't.

1599
01:10:28,076 --> 01:10:29,676
It would've been so funny if you ordered another one.

1600
01:10:31,676 --> 01:10:33,709
- That was so good. / - It was.

1601
01:10:34,909 --> 01:10:35,976
Look at my bones.

1602
01:10:37,076 --> 01:10:38,576
You've made a tower.

1603
01:10:41,043 --> 01:10:44,076
Well, we enjoyed a day trip with Silla in the daytime.

1604
01:10:44,076 --> 01:10:47,876
Now, let's see how beautiful Silla's evening is.

1605
01:10:47,876 --> 01:10:49,043
We'll have to compare.

1606
01:10:49,043 --> 01:10:50,243
Let's go check out the Silla night.

1607
01:10:50,243 --> 01:10:51,176
Look forward to it.

1608
01:10:51,176 --> 01:10:52,343
- Can I? / - Yes.

1609
01:10:52,343 --> 01:10:53,709
It's really beautiful.

1610
01:10:53,709 --> 01:10:56,409
(Yein's Evening Trip, Silla in the moonlight)

1611
01:10:56,409 --> 01:10:58,809
We ate dinner, so we decided to take a stroll.

1612
01:10:59,643 --> 01:11:02,543
- This is Silla's evening. / - Yes, Silla's evening.

1613
01:11:02,543 --> 01:11:05,743
- It's different from the day. / - It's completely different.

1614
01:11:05,743 --> 01:11:08,243
- That's interesting. / - We revisited the place...

1615
01:11:08,243 --> 01:11:09,609
We went during the day.

1616
01:11:11,243 --> 01:11:13,043
(It feels slightly scary)

1617
01:11:13,043 --> 01:11:14,876
It's like that.

1618
01:11:18,543 --> 01:11:20,776
They turn on the lights, so it's very pretty.

1619
01:11:23,976 --> 01:11:25,509
- Isn't it pretty? / - It's so pretty.

1620
01:11:25,743 --> 01:11:27,743
It's like a mood lamp.

1621
01:11:28,909 --> 01:11:30,209
It's so pretty.

1622
01:11:32,409 --> 01:11:34,343
- Why is it pink? / - It was so pretty.

1623
01:11:34,343 --> 01:11:37,909
It displays the 8 colors of Gyeongju.

1624
01:11:42,043 --> 01:11:44,576
Lovelyz and pink Cheomseongdae go together so well.

1625
01:11:44,576 --> 01:11:46,609
- It was so pretty. / - We took many pictures.

1626
01:11:47,376 --> 01:11:50,009
It cycles through 8 colors.

1627
01:11:50,009 --> 01:11:52,509
(From 7 p.m. the color changes every 30 minutes)

1628
01:11:52,509 --> 01:11:53,676
(You can see Cheomseongdae in 8 different colors)

1629
01:11:54,676 --> 01:11:55,243
- Sujeong. / - Yes.

1630
01:11:55,243 --> 01:11:57,976
It's finally time for the night view highlight.

1631
01:11:58,343 --> 01:12:01,076
We'll be visiting Donggung Palace and Wolji Pond.

1632
01:12:04,543 --> 01:12:06,943
(This is Donggung Palace and Wolji Pond)

1633
01:12:07,843 --> 01:12:09,043
Donggung Palace and Wolji Pond.

1634
01:12:09,043 --> 01:12:10,976
This is the highlight.

1635
01:12:10,976 --> 01:12:12,609
(This night scenery is very famous)

1636
01:12:14,876 --> 01:12:16,509
(Donggung Palace and Wolji Pond)

1637
01:12:16,509 --> 01:12:20,243
(This location was used for banquets for)

1638
01:12:20,243 --> 01:12:23,143
(National celebrations or important guests)

1639
01:12:25,509 --> 01:12:27,709
Entry is $2 per person.

1640
01:12:27,709 --> 01:12:29,109
- $2? / - That's affordable.

1641
01:12:29,409 --> 01:12:31,143
It's open all-year-round.

1642
01:12:31,143 --> 01:12:32,476
It's very impressive.

1643
01:12:32,476 --> 01:12:34,309
It's perfect as a final destination for the trip.

1644
01:12:34,309 --> 01:12:35,309
It really is.

1645
01:12:35,309 --> 01:12:37,776
Everything's so calm here.

1646
01:12:37,776 --> 01:12:40,243
It's also known as Anapji Pond.

1647
01:12:40,243 --> 01:12:41,343
That's another name for it.

1648
01:12:41,343 --> 01:12:43,776
- From the Joseon Dynasty. / - Anapji.

1649
01:12:52,476 --> 01:12:55,043
It's impressive. They didn't have that during my time.

1650
01:12:55,043 --> 01:12:57,143
What was your favorite part of the trip today?

1651
01:12:58,643 --> 01:13:00,176
Everything was fun today.

1652
01:13:00,176 --> 01:13:02,543
There's this too. Gyeongju was

1653
01:13:02,543 --> 01:13:05,643
the capital of Silla. It feels very ancient.

1654
01:13:05,643 --> 01:13:09,576
Yet, there are modern places like Hwangridangil.

1655
01:13:09,576 --> 01:13:12,543
It's like jumping from past to present.

1656
01:13:12,543 --> 01:13:15,443
- It made Gyeongju more fun. / - We really did a lot.

1657
01:13:15,443 --> 01:13:16,576
Like traveling in a time machine.

1658
01:13:17,009 --> 01:13:21,043
(A day of rejuvenation away from daily life)

1659
01:13:21,309 --> 01:13:24,243
I think we showed Deer Bread's brand...

1660
01:13:24,243 --> 01:13:25,976
- Of fun and enjoyment. / - You're right.

1661
01:13:25,976 --> 01:13:28,576
- We had great chemistry, right? / - You were great.

1662
01:13:28,576 --> 01:13:29,743
It was fine.

1663
01:13:30,343 --> 01:13:31,409
Satisfied with ourselves.

1664
01:13:32,576 --> 01:13:33,443
I had fun.

1665
01:13:33,443 --> 01:13:36,509
Come to Gyeongju with Deer Bread!

1666
01:13:36,776 --> 01:13:39,776
(Gyeongju with Deer Bread made the time fly)

1667
01:13:40,776 --> 01:13:42,909
You did so well.

1668
01:13:42,909 --> 01:13:46,176
You sure experienced some fine things at Gyeongju.

1669
01:13:46,176 --> 01:13:48,243
It wasn't the Gyeongju we knew.

1670
01:13:48,243 --> 01:13:50,276
You two weren't the Lovelyz members we knew either.

1671
01:13:50,276 --> 01:13:51,643
We were shocked.

1672
01:13:51,943 --> 01:13:53,243
Let's talk about the ribs.

1673
01:13:53,243 --> 01:13:55,209
- The ribs were so... / - Incredible.

1674
01:13:55,209 --> 01:13:57,676
I didn't think the pumpkin, braised ribs

1675
01:13:57,676 --> 01:14:01,143
and glutinous rice would go well together.

1676
01:14:01,143 --> 01:14:03,643
But once you enjoy the three of them together...

1677
01:14:03,643 --> 01:14:06,276
- It's just so delicious. / - So good.

1678
01:14:06,776 --> 01:14:07,976
How much can you drink?

1679
01:14:08,143 --> 01:14:11,076
I think I've finished up to 2 bottles of soju.

1680
01:14:12,709 --> 01:14:13,809
Respect.

1681
01:14:13,976 --> 01:14:15,443
You're totally my style.

1682
01:14:16,109 --> 01:14:18,343
I'm looking forward to seeing you in 10 years.

1683
01:14:19,176 --> 01:14:22,076
It's time to take a look at the final expense. Yein,

1684
01:14:22,076 --> 01:14:23,543
what was the figure?

1685
01:14:23,543 --> 01:14:25,309
The total expense

1686
01:14:25,309 --> 01:14:28,209
for our day-trip to Gyeongju was...

1687
01:14:28,209 --> 01:14:31,543
- Per person. / - $70 for transport...

1688
01:14:31,543 --> 01:14:34,443
And $89 for food.

1689
01:14:34,443 --> 01:14:37,209
For a total of $159.

1690
01:14:39,043 --> 01:14:41,243
- Well... / - They showed us a lot.

1691
01:14:41,243 --> 01:14:43,176
- To show you a variety. / - It was the airplane.

1692
01:14:43,176 --> 01:14:45,176
And you took the hot-air balloon.

1693
01:14:45,176 --> 01:14:47,843
- And ate 4 servings each. / - Right.

1694
01:14:49,176 --> 01:14:50,843
Final words.

1695
01:14:50,843 --> 01:14:53,309
Everyone, a place exists where

1696
01:14:53,309 --> 01:14:55,609
Korea's tradition intermingles with modernity.

1697
01:14:55,609 --> 01:14:57,043
Enjoy natural exhilaration and

1698
01:14:57,043 --> 01:14:58,943
the beauty of the moonlight.

Now please take out your phones for the vote.

Gyeongju with Deer Bread's plan?

1703

Please cast your votes.

1704
01:15:14,609 --> 01:15:17,443
(Gyeongju with Deer Bread planned a trip)

1705
01:15:17,443 --> 01:15:20,143
(What will the judges choose?)

1706
01:15:20,843 --> 01:15:24,509
Will you choose the I Wish Gunsan?

1707
01:15:25,109 --> 01:15:28,609
Or the Gyeongju with Deer Bread?

1708
01:15:28,609 --> 01:15:31,776
What will the judges choose?

1709
01:15:31,776 --> 01:15:33,743
Here we go.

1710
01:15:33,743 --> 01:15:35,476
Braised ribs or beef ribs?

1711
01:15:35,476 --> 01:15:37,009
Gyeongju with Deer Bread.

1712
01:15:37,543 --> 01:15:39,709
Gunsan. Will you choose bigger portion food or not?

1713
01:15:39,709 --> 01:15:41,143
- I'm nervous. / - Me too.

1714
01:15:41,609 --> 01:15:43,309
I don't know why, but I am.

1715
01:15:43,309 --> 01:15:45,043
Will you choose Gyeongju or Gunsan?

1716
01:15:45,043 --> 01:15:46,443
Green plum wine or beer?

1717
01:15:48,009 --> 01:15:50,209
What's this?

1718
01:15:50,209 --> 01:15:52,309
- It's similar. / - No way.

1719
01:15:52,309 --> 01:15:53,676
What's going on?

1720
01:15:53,676 --> 01:15:54,876
The last digit!

1721
01:15:55,343 --> 01:15:57,109
Gyeongju!

1722
01:15:57,109 --> 01:15:59,309
Gyeongju!

1723
01:15:59,309 --> 01:16:01,009
Gyeongju!

1724
01:16:04,743 --> 01:16:06,543
It's okay.

1725
01:16:06,543 --> 01:16:07,709
(Gyeongju seizes the victory)

1726
01:16:10,243 --> 01:16:12,909
Gosh. That must've been close.

1727
01:16:12,909 --> 01:16:14,009
It was a close match.

1728
01:16:14,009 --> 01:16:16,409
Shall we hear from our winners?

1729
01:16:16,409 --> 01:16:19,709
We really enjoyed our trip.

1730
01:16:19,709 --> 01:16:23,009
I feel so happy that we won the votes as well.

1731
01:16:23,009 --> 01:16:25,109
Everyone, please pay Gyeongju a visit.

1732
01:16:25,109 --> 01:16:26,443
- Great. / - We had a great time.

1733
01:16:26,443 --> 01:16:31,009
Well, we had Dongwun as our special host.

1734
01:16:31,009 --> 01:16:31,743
How was it?

1735
01:16:31,743 --> 01:16:35,009
Most of you think of overseas travel for vacations.

1736
01:16:35,009 --> 01:16:36,809
But thanks to Battle Trip,

1737
01:16:36,809 --> 01:16:40,076
we're being introduced to great domestic destinations.

1738
01:16:40,076 --> 01:16:42,443
Please continue your interest in traveling domestically.

1739
01:16:42,443 --> 01:16:44,409
