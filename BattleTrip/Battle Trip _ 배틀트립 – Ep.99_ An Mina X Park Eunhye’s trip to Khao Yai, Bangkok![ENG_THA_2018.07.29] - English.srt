Song Vacation!

00:00:06,807 --> 00:00:09,540
It's the world's second largest safari.

4
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:11,507
Hey!

5
00:00:12,407 --> 00:00:15,240
The world's longest cable car.

6
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:16,574
It feels really different.

7
00:00:16,574 --> 00:00:17,774
It's just like a painting.

8
00:00:17,774 --> 00:00:19,674
1, 2, 3.

9
00:00:20,507 --> 00:00:22,207
We have to eat this.

10
00:00:24,874 --> 00:00:26,340
This is it!

11
00:00:26,574 --> 00:00:29,474
(Who will be the winning team?)

12
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:33,807

Battle Trip!

18
00:00:44,374 --> 00:00:47,774
Just like last week, today's theme is

19
00:00:47,774 --> 00:00:50,107
the emerging vacation spots of 2018.

20
00:00:50,107 --> 00:00:54,574
We will give out books if you take a photo of you

21
00:00:54,574 --> 00:00:56,840
watching Battle Trip and post it on your social media.

22
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:58,540
We look forward to your participation.

23
00:00:58,540 --> 00:01:00,874
We have our 100 impartial judges

24
00:01:00,874 --> 00:01:02,707
who will vote on today's trips.

25
00:01:02,707 --> 00:01:03,974
- Welcome. / - Welcome.

26
00:01:05,274 --> 00:01:07,540
Alright. The vacation season has begun.

27
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:09,440
JR, do you have any good tips

28
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:11,040
when going on vacation?

29
00:01:11,374 --> 00:01:14,140
- Actually, I studied it a little. / - Good.

30
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:17,607
An airport is where you start your trip.

31
00:01:17,607 --> 00:01:19,174
You can check congestion levels of

32
00:01:19,174 --> 00:01:21,240
the departure lounge beforehand.

33
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:24,507
You can check it online...

34
00:01:24,507 --> 00:01:26,207
- Right. / - Or a mobile application.

35
00:01:26,207 --> 00:01:28,007
It shows the current congestion level

36
00:01:28,007 --> 00:01:30,374
and the expected level for tomorrow.

37
00:01:30,374 --> 00:01:33,640
- That's amazing. / - I had a problem with it once.

38
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:36,174
During the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics...

39
00:01:36,674 --> 00:01:38,740
It took twice the time to go through departure.

40
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:40,407
So you'd better...

41
00:01:40,407 --> 00:01:43,374
- Check it before you leave. / - He's right.

42
00:01:43,374 --> 00:01:44,774
And there's an important thing.

43
00:01:44,774 --> 00:01:47,674
You take a lot of photos and upload them on

44
00:01:47,674 --> 00:01:50,107
your social media when you go on an overseas trip.

45
00:01:50,107 --> 00:01:52,274
But it's very dangerous

46
00:01:52,274 --> 00:01:54,307
to upload a picture of your airline ticket.

47
00:01:54,307 --> 00:01:55,540
- Why? People do that a lot. / - That's because...

48
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:57,207
It has a barcode on it.

49
00:01:57,207 --> 00:01:59,807
The barcode contains a lot of information

50
00:01:59,807 --> 00:02:01,374
as well as a lot of personal information.

51
00:02:01,374 --> 00:02:03,907
Some bad people could use it

52
00:02:03,907 --> 00:02:05,707
to leak personal information.

53
00:02:05,707 --> 00:02:07,040
- We should be careful. / - Make sure...

54
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,507
Not to show barcodes.

55
00:02:08,774 --> 00:02:11,674
- I'll remember that. / - And when you buy tickets...

56
00:02:11,674 --> 00:02:13,474
You look for cheap ones.

57
00:02:13,474 --> 00:02:15,107
But you can't buy anything just because it's cheap.

58
00:02:15,107 --> 00:02:17,440
Some special deals offer

59
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:20,374
0kg of baggage service.

60
00:02:20,374 --> 00:02:22,174
It means you have to pay extra.

61
00:02:22,174 --> 00:02:24,307
You have to pay extra for every kilogram,

62
00:02:24,307 --> 00:02:26,040
So it can be more expensive than the regular price.

63
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:29,307
Make sure to check it before you buy airline tickets.

64
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:33,074
These are the tips for overseas trips we prepared.

65
00:02:33,074 --> 00:02:35,774
Last week, we went to Phu Quoc, Vietnam.

66
00:02:35,774 --> 00:02:39,107
And today, we're going to Khao Yai, Thailand.

67
00:02:39,107 --> 00:02:40,940
- Are you going to be okay? / - To be honest...

68
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:42,307
I liked their trip.

69
00:02:42,307 --> 00:02:45,874
But I couldn't wait to show you our trip.

70
00:02:45,874 --> 00:02:47,240
Think about it.

71
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:49,874
Why do you think our trip is introduced later?

72
00:02:49,907 --> 00:02:51,407
Why do you think our video is played later?

73
00:02:51,507 --> 00:02:53,307
I guess you don't watch our show much.

74
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:56,474
We play the fun ones first.

75
00:02:58,474 --> 00:03:01,474
They said Phu Quoc is like an unknown world.

76
00:03:01,474 --> 00:03:03,640
But all we didn't know

77
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:05,574
was the name, Phu Quoc.

78
00:03:05,574 --> 00:03:07,907
But our trip to Khao Yai will show...

79
00:03:07,907 --> 00:03:09,274
- A whole new world. / - It's that good?

80
00:03:09,274 --> 00:03:12,374
The whole thing is a journey into the unknown.

81
00:03:12,374 --> 00:03:14,107
- Alright. / - Everything is unknown.

82
00:03:14,107 --> 00:03:15,374
What else?

83
00:03:15,374 --> 00:03:18,107
Khao Yai is not

84
00:03:18,107 --> 00:03:20,674
well known to foreigners...

85
00:03:20,907 --> 00:03:22,907
But it's a perfect place for eco-tourism...

86
00:03:23,307 --> 00:03:26,140
And the best vacation spot for Thai people.

87
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,740
Eco means it's clean.

88
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:30,240
Eco means it's hard.

89
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:32,440
No, it means it's relaxing.

90
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:34,440
Eco means low tech. And it means inconvenience.

91
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:36,307
So do you like polluted places?

92
00:03:36,307 --> 00:03:37,340
No.

93
00:03:38,307 --> 00:03:39,940
- Alright, then. / - People lie so much...

94
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:42,540
Let's watch their trip to Khao Yai

95
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:45,074
and enjoy the unknown world.

96
00:03:45,874 --> 00:03:47,740
- What's your team name? / - 1, 2, 3.

97
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:49,374
- An Park Tour. / - An Park Tour.

98
00:03:49,507 --> 00:03:50,840
Let's watch it together.

99
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:52,540
(An Park Tour to Khao Yai starts)

100
00:03:52,707 --> 00:03:53,974
I'm excited.

101
00:03:53,974 --> 00:03:55,174
- It feels real now, right? / - Yeah.

102
00:03:56,207 --> 00:03:59,240
This is my first time to go on a trip for a TV show.

103
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:01,674
My heart is pounding.

104
00:04:01,874 --> 00:04:02,940
What should I do?

105
00:04:04,174 --> 00:04:06,807
We shot a movie together before.

106
00:04:06,807 --> 00:04:10,607
It's called "Steel Rain."

107
00:04:10,874 --> 00:04:14,307
I didn't belong to any agency at that time.

108
00:04:14,307 --> 00:04:17,174
And she introduced me to her agency.

109
00:04:17,507 --> 00:04:20,440
She took good care of me.

110
00:04:20,507 --> 00:04:22,540
- In fact, she's well known... / - Me?

111
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:25,307
For taking good care of other people.

112
00:04:25,307 --> 00:04:26,907
- What a nice friend. / - You're very kind.

113
00:04:27,974 --> 00:04:30,707
I think we'll hit it off on a trip.

114
00:04:30,707 --> 00:04:33,474
While I'm clumsy and careless...

115
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:36,307
Mina is meticulous...

116
00:04:36,374 --> 00:04:39,740
Quiet and organized.

117
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:40,974
She speaks English well.

118
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:43,040
Did you live abroad?

119
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:45,374
- I used to live in New Zealand. / - New Zealand.

120
00:04:45,374 --> 00:04:49,874
Unless she's not drunk...

121
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,174
What are you talking about?

122
00:04:52,574 --> 00:04:54,174
Do you have drinking habits?

123
00:04:54,174 --> 00:04:55,907
She becomes cute when she's drunk.

124
00:04:56,574 --> 00:04:58,407
- She becomes cute. / - Doesn't she become too cute?

125
00:04:58,407 --> 00:05:00,474
- Yes, she's really cute. / - I see.

126
00:05:00,507 --> 00:05:01,607
No.

127
00:05:01,707 --> 00:05:04,607
Is it hard for you to travel far since you have kids?

128
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:07,907
I don't feel comfortable traveling far without my kids.

129
00:05:07,907 --> 00:05:09,707
And I won't be able to have fun either.

130
00:05:09,707 --> 00:05:10,940
Stop lying.

131
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:14,240
We'll see if you're having fun or not.

132
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:17,174
After I had my kids, traveling destinations

133
00:05:17,174 --> 00:05:20,174
became places that my kids could go too.

134
00:05:20,507 --> 00:05:23,040
I had to go to safe and clean places

135
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:25,140
and places where I could feed them.

136
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,774
I had to choose places I could easily feed them.

137
00:05:29,174 --> 00:05:31,507
I thought it might be nice to go with the opposite of that.

138
00:05:31,507 --> 00:05:32,774
A place I wouldn't normally go to?

139
00:05:32,774 --> 00:05:35,040
- I like adventures. / - I see.

140
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:38,607
I'd like to help you get out of your daily life.

141
00:05:38,607 --> 00:05:39,974
Let's go to a place no one has visited before.

142
00:05:39,974 --> 00:05:42,140
I've been to Thailand about four times.

143
00:05:42,874 --> 00:05:45,474
- I'm as good as a local. / - She's been there a lot.

144
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:52,207
(She asked her friends in Thailand for recommendations)

145
00:05:52,407 --> 00:05:54,840
(She obtains special information from Thailand)

146
00:05:54,907 --> 00:05:57,007
I asked around a lot this time.

147
00:05:57,007 --> 00:06:01,207
There's a huge national park in Thailand.

148
00:06:01,407 --> 00:06:03,607
It's called Khao Yai National Park.

149
00:06:03,607 --> 00:06:06,007
There are wild animals and it's a jungle.

150
00:06:07,207 --> 00:06:08,974
We ought to experience something like that.

151
00:06:09,407 --> 00:06:12,607
(Khao Yai is located in the northeast of Bangkok)

152
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:17,907
(An unknown land of grand nature)

153
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:23,474
(It's Thailand's very first national park)

154
00:06:24,074 --> 00:06:26,740
- What's that? / - Look at that.

155
00:06:27,607 --> 00:06:29,607
- What is that? / - Wow.

156
00:06:29,607 --> 00:06:33,140
That's a wild elephant. It's not kept in a cage.

157
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:36,374
We have to come up with the name of our tour.

158
00:06:36,374 --> 00:06:39,074
How about An Park Tour using our last names?

159
00:06:39,074 --> 00:06:40,740
It also represents that I want to be outside

160
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:42,040
of the national park while you want to be inside.

161
00:06:43,507 --> 00:06:45,440
- That's true. / - An Park Tour.

162
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,240
Okay. An Park Tour. Like this?

163
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,974
- An Park. / - An Park.

164
00:06:48,974 --> 00:06:50,374
An Park Tour!

165
00:06:50,774 --> 00:06:51,874
Let's do it again.

166
00:06:51,874 --> 00:06:53,207
(Will they be okay in Thailand?)

167
00:06:53,874 --> 00:06:55,907
An Park Tour!

168
00:06:57,740 --> 00:07:00,340
We're headed to Khao Yai National Park.

169
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:03,074
Inside, there are wild animals.

170
00:07:05,507 --> 00:07:08,207
It's really magnificent here already.

171
00:07:10,474 --> 00:07:11,707
- It's real Mother Nature. / - That's a real jungle.

172
00:07:11,707 --> 00:07:14,174
It's very different from what you'd expect.

173
00:07:14,974 --> 00:07:18,807
(The mission is to find the hidden traces of wildness)

174
00:07:19,074 --> 00:07:20,474
You have to see deer like that.

175
00:07:20,474 --> 00:07:21,307
It's fascinating.

176
00:07:21,307 --> 00:07:22,440
(This is so interesting)

177
00:07:23,407 --> 00:07:25,840
Will this get edited out if we don't see an elephant?

178
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,140
Gosh, what's that?

179
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:31,574
It showed up as if it was waiting.

180
00:07:31,974 --> 00:07:36,140
Today, it'll feel like a farm in Italy.

181
00:07:36,907 --> 00:07:39,607
It's the largest winery in Khao Yai.

182
00:07:39,607 --> 00:07:43,074
How is there a winery in Thailand?

183
00:07:43,107 --> 00:07:44,774
This! I like this!

184
00:07:44,774 --> 00:07:46,774
You went to a night market too!

185
00:07:46,774 --> 00:07:49,474
- Thailand is known for night markets. / - Great, great.

186
00:07:49,574 --> 00:07:51,707
It's not like the commercialized night market.

187
00:07:51,707 --> 00:07:54,040
It's a real, local night market.

188
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,274
There's so much water.

189
00:07:55,274 --> 00:07:57,474
Normally, it's three times a year.

190
00:07:57,474 --> 00:07:59,574
This is Thai style sausage.

191
00:07:59,574 --> 00:08:01,874
I enjoy adventures.

192
00:08:01,874 --> 00:08:04,540
- Mina was a guide on this trip. / - Yes, indeed.

193
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:06,107
It must've been so convenient.

194
00:08:07,574 --> 00:08:09,207
(Her preferences are clearly defined)

195
00:08:09,207 --> 00:08:10,640
It does smell.

196
00:08:12,107 --> 00:08:13,540
Wow!

197
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:14,707
Hey, that looks good.

198
00:08:14,707 --> 00:08:16,040
I like this.

199
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,607
Can we eat this at the hotel?

200
00:08:17,607 --> 00:08:18,974
What's that? What's that?

201
00:08:18,974 --> 00:08:20,340
What?

202
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:22,907
(She's innocent and gets easily scared)

203
00:08:22,907 --> 00:08:24,207
You startled me.

204
00:08:24,307 --> 00:08:26,640
(Park Eunhye)

205
00:08:27,207 --> 00:08:29,440
An Park Tour!

206
00:08:29,974 --> 00:08:33,440
(5 hours and 45 minutes to Bangkok from Incheon)

207
00:08:35,507 --> 00:08:39,274
- We've arrived at Bangkok. / - Right.

208
00:08:39,307 --> 00:08:42,374
There aren't any currency exchange places

209
00:08:42,374 --> 00:08:43,407
in Khao Yai.

210
00:08:43,407 --> 00:08:45,074
- Really? / - Yes, so...

211
00:08:45,074 --> 00:08:46,474
- We need to... / - Because it's the countryside?

212
00:08:46,474 --> 00:08:48,940
Exchange the money here.

213
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:50,007
For convenience.

214
00:08:50,007 --> 00:08:52,074
- To baht? / - Yes, baht.

215
00:08:52,074 --> 00:08:55,940
We exchanged the money to Thai baht.

216
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:57,874
Can't you use your cards in Khao Yai?

217
00:08:57,874 --> 00:09:00,440
It's a rural area, credit cards aren't widely accepted.

218
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:03,240
- You use cash then. / - It's better to bring cash.

219
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:05,374
(How to get to Khao Yai, 120km away from Bangkok)

220
00:09:05,374 --> 00:09:08,507
(It takes 1 hour and 43 minutes by car)

221
00:09:08,507 --> 00:09:12,440
You can get there by bus or train.

222
00:09:13,074 --> 00:09:14,974
The train runs only twice a day.

223
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,607
It's hard to get on a bus too.

224
00:09:16,607 --> 00:09:18,607
(It takes 6 to 7 hours by train)

225
00:09:18,607 --> 00:09:20,707
(It takes 3 hours and 30 minutes to 4 hours by bus)

226
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:22,507
- For now... / - How about the taxi?

227
00:09:23,007 --> 00:09:25,274
We can get there by taxi...

228
00:09:25,274 --> 00:09:27,707
But it'd be hard to get around the place that way.

229
00:09:27,707 --> 00:09:29,107
Why? Aren't there any taxis in Khao Yai?

230
00:09:29,107 --> 00:09:30,840
Khao Yai doesn't have taxis.

231
00:09:31,374 --> 00:09:34,607
- We'll rent a car and drive there. / - A rental car.

232
00:09:34,607 --> 00:09:36,940
I'll drive since you prepared everything.

233
00:09:37,574 --> 00:09:39,607
Driving in Thailand is harder than you think.

234
00:09:39,607 --> 00:09:42,774
But you'll get used to it quicker than you think.

235
00:09:42,807 --> 00:09:44,307
Can you trust me?

236
00:09:44,974 --> 00:09:46,140
Aren't you scared?

237
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:48,440
- Alright. / - Hold on.

238
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:51,440
- This is on the left side... / - This is automatic, right?

239
00:09:52,174 --> 00:09:54,007
Please drive safely.

240
00:09:58,540 --> 00:10:01,974
(They head to Khao Yai which is 2 hours from Bangkok)

241
00:10:04,074 --> 00:10:05,140
I'm looking forward to it.

242
00:10:05,374 --> 00:10:07,474
(They set out with high expectations about their trip)

243
00:10:07,874 --> 00:10:09,807
(How to get to Khao Yai, 120km away from Bangkok)

244
00:10:09,807 --> 00:10:12,307
(It takes 1 hour and 43 minutes by car)

245
00:10:12,874 --> 00:10:14,074
Let's get some sleep.

246
00:10:15,007 --> 00:10:17,274
Tomorrow... Khao Yai.

247
00:10:18,374 --> 00:10:21,007
(The first day of their trip has finally dawned)

248
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:26,840
For breakfast today, we'll go to

249
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:29,040
a pretty restaurant only locals go to.

250
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,140
- Great, great. / - They don't have an English menu.

251
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:33,207
- I bet the air is really fresh. / - It really is.

252
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:37,007
(A local restaurant in nature)

253
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:40,807
(Eunhye has the left lane to herself while driving)

254
00:10:40,807 --> 00:10:43,440
Look at that. It's so pretty. I love roads like this.

255
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,607
- I love these kinds of trees. / - Right

256
00:10:46,774 --> 00:10:49,974
This must be it. Gosh, it's so pretty. What is this?

257
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:53,107
Hey, I didn't know such a place existed here.

258
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,540
(The peaceful nature is evident in the garden)

259
00:10:57,540 --> 00:10:59,374
Gosh, this place is so pretty.

260
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:02,207
Goodness, look at that. What is this place?

261
00:11:02,374 --> 00:11:04,207
I love these kinds of places.

262
00:11:04,507 --> 00:11:07,274
- That's a restaurant? / - Yes, we went for breakfast.

263
00:11:07,274 --> 00:11:10,307
Only locals frequent the restaurant. I'm serious.

264
00:11:11,107 --> 00:11:13,074
Gosh, it's so pretty. It's right up my alley.

265
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:18,174
- Right now... / - Yes, I like it.

266
00:11:18,174 --> 00:11:19,874
- Do you like it? Is it fun? / - This is fun.

267
00:11:19,874 --> 00:11:22,507
(The wooden merry-go-round is Eunhye's favorite)

268
00:11:22,674 --> 00:11:23,740
I'm dizzy.

269
00:11:25,507 --> 00:11:27,274
(The wooden see-saw brings back memories)

270
00:11:27,274 --> 00:11:29,874
- Just like that? / - This is fun.

271
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:32,074
It's been ages since I'd been on a see-saw.

272
00:11:32,074 --> 00:11:33,874
- This is nice. / - Seriously.

273
00:11:36,507 --> 00:11:37,940
I love this place.

274
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:41,840
Eunhye, this is the famous spot.

275
00:11:42,307 --> 00:11:44,874
- The fluttering laced sheet. / - Okay.

276
00:11:45,374 --> 00:11:48,340
It just started getting popular among the locals.

277
00:11:48,974 --> 00:11:52,440
- If you sit over there... / - It'd look amazing...

278
00:11:55,107 --> 00:11:56,707
No, look over there.

279
00:11:59,174 --> 00:12:01,707
Hey, this is a honeymoon photo for newlyweds.

280
00:12:01,707 --> 00:12:03,874
- That's the best photo. / - I took it.

281
00:12:03,874 --> 00:12:05,074
(Free from kids, no husbands today)

282
00:12:05,074 --> 00:12:07,640
"No husbands today."

283
00:12:08,974 --> 00:12:11,874
Alright. Since we took our photos...

284
00:12:11,874 --> 00:12:13,940
- Let's go eat a tasty breakfast. / - We went to eat.

285
00:12:15,374 --> 00:12:18,674
This place would look beautiful even if it rains here.

286
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:22,007
It was the monsoon season but it didn't rain.

287
00:12:23,507 --> 00:12:24,774
Oh, no.

288
00:12:25,074 --> 00:12:26,640
What is it? What?

289
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:30,140
Everything was written in Thai.

290
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:33,374
- Oh, no! / - It means only Thai people visit.

291
00:12:33,374 --> 00:12:34,474
(The class of a seasoned adventurer)

292
00:12:34,474 --> 00:12:37,174
We're going to have this one, this one...

293
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:39,740
- Thank you. / - Are we going to have this?

294
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:41,274
- Are we having this? / - Yes.

295
00:12:41,474 --> 00:12:42,940
That looks really delicious.

296
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:45,240
Here it is. Here it comes.

297
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:50,007
Isn't that too much?

298
00:12:50,007 --> 00:12:52,074
I see. This is how it looks like.

299
00:12:53,374 --> 00:12:56,707
(Sausages made of glutinous rice and fermented pork

300
00:12:58,474 --> 00:13:01,407
(Sai krok Isan, about $3)

301
00:13:01,607 --> 00:13:03,607
These are garlic, ginger and chili peppers.

302
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:06,007
- This is a Thai sausage. / - Okay.

303
00:13:06,974 --> 00:13:09,774
People will either like it or hate it. I've never had it.

304
00:13:09,774 --> 00:13:11,540
I wanted to try it.

305
00:13:11,874 --> 00:13:13,940
They made the sausages from scratch.

306
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:15,607
That has to be delicious.

307
00:13:15,607 --> 00:13:18,440
- Don't you like Thai sausages? / - They are good.

308
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:20,407
- Yes, we ate them together before. / - Right.

309
00:13:21,507 --> 00:13:22,807
(She puts it in her mouth first)

310
00:13:22,807 --> 00:13:24,707
Shouldn't you eat the whole thing in one go?

311
00:13:24,707 --> 00:13:27,774
I was going to eat the whole thing at once...

312
00:13:27,974 --> 00:13:29,974
But when I just bit the sausage,

313
00:13:29,974 --> 00:13:31,840
the ginger flavor was overpowering.

314
00:13:34,074 --> 00:13:36,907
First of all, the sausage is good. It's delicious.

315
00:13:37,574 --> 00:13:40,307
- The sausage scent is strong. / - Right, right.

316
00:13:41,374 --> 00:13:43,507
It's good. Eunhye, you must eat it at once.

317
00:13:43,507 --> 00:13:45,840
It tastes like that dish in Korea.

318
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:49,440
It's like the pork belly wrap.

319
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,940
It tastes like that dish in Korea.

320
00:13:53,674 --> 00:13:54,440
It's like the pork belly wrap.

321
00:13:55,607 --> 00:13:56,707
Let's try it.

322
00:13:56,707 --> 00:13:57,807
(Whatever)

323
00:14:00,407 --> 00:14:02,340
(Isn't it the best-tasting dish in this galaxy?)

324
00:14:03,674 --> 00:14:06,207
(How will she evaluate the Thai sausage?)

325
00:14:08,907 --> 00:14:09,974
It's spicy.

326
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,874
(Screaming)

327
00:14:14,874 --> 00:14:16,440
- Why? / - It got spicier with every bite.

328
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:20,074
People who love spicy food will love this.

329
00:14:20,074 --> 00:14:21,674
Because it's really good.

330
00:14:22,074 --> 00:14:24,174
It's spicy and my tongue hurts.

331
00:14:24,674 --> 00:14:26,240
But I think I'll miss the dish later.

332
00:14:26,707 --> 00:14:29,740
This is definitely addicting.

333
00:14:30,307 --> 00:14:32,307
Since the chili pepper is strong,

334
00:14:32,307 --> 00:14:34,007
I can't taste garlic and ginger.

335
00:14:34,107 --> 00:14:39,274
And actually, it tastes sour like vinegar.

336
00:14:39,674 --> 00:14:42,140
I don't know where it's from.

337
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:43,607
Instead of just eating the sausages...

338
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:47,407
- It's better with the vegetables. / - I agree.

339
00:14:47,407 --> 00:14:50,174
- It's much better that way. / - I want beer.

340
00:14:50,474 --> 00:14:52,607
Why did you make me drive?

341
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:54,474
(Feeling sorry)

342
00:14:55,074 --> 00:14:56,107
What's this?

343
00:14:56,474 --> 00:14:58,874
We all know this, it's pad thai.

344
00:14:59,007 --> 00:15:02,440
Let's find out how the pad thai tastes

345
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:03,440
at a local restaurant recommended by the locals.

346
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:06,307
- My goodness, this is it. / - Pad thai is great.

347
00:15:06,307 --> 00:15:08,074
- That's the best way to go. / - That has to be delicious.

348
00:15:08,074 --> 00:15:09,940
But that pad thai looks different from the ones we know.

349
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:12,240
- That pad thai doesn't have eggs. / - Right?

350
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:17,774
It's good.

351
00:15:18,707 --> 00:15:21,107
We eat this a lot in Korea but in Korea...

352
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:24,607
- They add shrimp and seafood. / - Seafood...

353
00:15:25,107 --> 00:15:27,740
- This one has pork in it. / - I see.

354
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:29,807
I thought it was beef at first.

355
00:15:29,807 --> 00:15:31,874
It doesn't have that pork smell. And this.

356
00:15:31,874 --> 00:15:34,540
- The mung bean sprout. / - The bean sprout is raw.

357
00:15:35,674 --> 00:15:36,674
It's crispy.

358
00:15:37,974 --> 00:15:40,840
There's a hint of spiciness.

359
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:42,774
It's the spring onion.

360
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:45,040
It gets rid of the greasiness.

361
00:15:45,674 --> 00:15:47,640
With the spiciness from the spring onion...

362
00:15:48,107 --> 00:15:49,574
But this is so good.

363
00:15:49,607 --> 00:15:50,874
Yes, it's really good.

364
00:15:56,407 --> 00:15:57,640
Which one is your favorite?

365
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,374
I liked everything.

366
00:15:59,507 --> 00:16:01,607
- The sausage was my favorite. / - Same here.

367
00:16:01,874 --> 00:16:03,074
It was unique too.

368
00:16:03,074 --> 00:16:04,540
The taste keeps coming back to me.

369
00:16:06,674 --> 00:16:07,940
Where are we going after breakfast?

370
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:09,940
Here's the real reason for coming here.

371
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:12,707
We're heading to Khao Yai National Park.

372
00:16:12,974 --> 00:16:15,540
Inside the park, we'll meet the wild animals.

373
00:16:15,974 --> 00:16:17,707
Let's see if we can see the elephants.

374
00:16:17,707 --> 00:16:20,607
And the waterfall from hell. Haew Narok Waterfall.

375
00:16:20,774 --> 00:16:22,607
- That was the best. / - That looks amazing.

376
00:16:22,607 --> 00:16:24,340
We'll wrap up with a night safari tour.

377
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:26,540
With that, we'll end our trip for today.

378
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:28,407
(An Park Tour)

379
00:16:28,407 --> 00:16:31,940
(Khao Yai National Park)

380
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:33,374
You'll do the safari tour today.

381
00:16:33,374 --> 00:16:36,140
- It'll take days to see the park. / - I agree.

382
00:16:36,474 --> 00:16:37,807
We didn't get to see the whole place.

383
00:16:37,807 --> 00:16:39,540
(The entrance fee, about $13.50)

384
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:41,274
(It's additional $1.70 for the vehicle)

385
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:44,507
Gosh, this place already looks like a dense forest.

386
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:45,840
It's a jungle.

387
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:47,174
- It doesn't live at the peak. / - An elephant!

388
00:16:47,174 --> 00:16:48,640
Yes, an elephant.

389
00:16:49,007 --> 00:16:50,807
They told us to watch out for the elephants.

390
00:16:50,807 --> 00:16:53,274
It means that elephants walk around here.

391
00:16:54,307 --> 00:16:55,774
- It's cute. / - How adorable.

392
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,907
You can see that sign only at the park.

393
00:16:59,507 --> 00:17:01,040
You can get the maps.

394
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,607
Show me the place where we're visiting.

395
00:17:02,607 --> 00:17:05,840
This is the observatory for the elephants.

396
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:09,774
This is Haew Narok Waterfall where we need to visit.

397
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:13,840
- You need a car to get around. / - Right.

398
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:16,974
- We're going to the salt lick. / - What's that?

399
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:20,274
Elephants need to absorb salt.

400
00:17:20,274 --> 00:17:22,440
It's a place where they lick salt.

401
00:17:23,874 --> 00:17:25,074
- Elephants are always seen there. / - Mina...

402
00:17:25,074 --> 00:17:27,107
You really studied a lot.

403
00:17:27,974 --> 00:17:30,307
The elephants come to that place and lick salt.

404
00:17:30,307 --> 00:17:31,740
I heard a herd of elephants visits that place.

405
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:34,274
- You can just wait there then. / - Right.

406
00:17:34,274 --> 00:17:36,840
- It's literally salt lick? / - Yes, it's called salt lick.

407
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:38,674
Goodness.

408
00:17:38,674 --> 00:17:40,074
Be careful.

409
00:17:40,874 --> 00:17:43,940
- Oh, no. / - It's so cute. It's looking at us.

410
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:45,340
Monkey.

411
00:17:46,707 --> 00:17:48,374
- Look. There's another one. / - It's dangerous.

412
00:17:48,374 --> 00:17:51,274
I'm usually scared of monkeys.

413
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,840
But the monkeys there were very clean.

414
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,874
They're not aggressive as long as you

415
00:17:55,874 --> 00:17:57,674
don't touch them and let them be.

416
00:17:57,674 --> 00:17:59,440
- That baby monkey. / - That monkey's so cute.

417
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:01,307
It was so cute.

418
00:18:01,574 --> 00:18:03,374
They climb up trees just like that.

419
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:06,340
You can't touch them. Can you feed them?

420
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:09,240
- No, never. / - They are wild monkeys.

421
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:12,107
(You can't see wild monkeys at a zoo)

422
00:18:12,107 --> 00:18:15,907
(They are on full alert)

423
00:18:17,474 --> 00:18:19,307
(Let's run away for now)

424
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:21,907
- That's amazing. / - Let's clap.

425
00:18:21,907 --> 00:18:23,974
- Amazing. / - Gosh, the monkey.

426
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:27,674
- That's amazing. / - Let's clap.

427
00:18:27,674 --> 00:18:28,974
It's fascinating.

428
00:18:30,374 --> 00:18:32,974
It tapped the other one.

429
00:18:32,974 --> 00:18:35,174
(Just lower your head)

430
00:18:35,174 --> 00:18:36,274
How cute.

431
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:39,507
They were friends.

432
00:18:39,507 --> 00:18:41,607
- You should be careful. / - They're catching lice.

433
00:18:41,607 --> 00:18:42,840
Right, we must drive carefully there.

434
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:45,207
- It's with a baby monkey too. / - There's another one.

435
00:18:45,207 --> 00:18:46,840
- This is awesome. / - It's with a baby monkey too.

436
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:49,307
- They're talking. / - There are so many.

437
00:18:49,507 --> 00:18:50,574
You're right.

438
00:18:52,074 --> 00:18:54,574
They're hanging onto the trees like koalas.

439
00:18:55,807 --> 00:18:56,907
Those monkeys...

440
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:00,107
- Look behind you. / - They're lying on the road.

441
00:19:00,207 --> 00:19:02,274
- They're catching lice in the open. / - My gosh.

442
00:19:03,174 --> 00:19:05,007
The monkey must've said, "Hey, lie down here."

443
00:19:05,007 --> 00:19:07,540
It's so intriguing how they're not dangerous.

444
00:19:08,107 --> 00:19:09,040
Don't you think

445
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:11,540
they'll come and catch lice if we sit here?

446
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:14,107
- They're eating. / - Bye.

447
00:19:14,107 --> 00:19:15,707
(We'll catch lice for you next time)

448
00:19:16,807 --> 00:19:20,840
(An Park Tour's animal handbook in Khao Yai)

449
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:22,340
When you go to tourist attractions

450
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:23,974
in Japan or Bangkok...

451
00:19:23,974 --> 00:19:26,207
Monkeys usually come at you and look scary.

452
00:19:26,207 --> 00:19:28,207
They're usually scary but those monkeys...

453
00:19:28,207 --> 00:19:29,674
- Were peaceful. / - They were, yes.

454
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:31,940
- They're going about their day. / - That's right.

455
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:34,507
They were just spending their time. They're so cute.

456
00:19:34,507 --> 00:19:36,174
The baby monkey was glued to the mother monkey.

457
00:19:36,174 --> 00:19:38,274
- It looked so adorable. / - It was sitting on the lap.

458
00:19:38,274 --> 00:19:40,707
When I saw the monkeys, I got excited.

459
00:19:40,707 --> 00:19:42,707
I really hope we get to see the elephants.

460
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:45,474
- I think we might be able to. / - Yes, I think so too.

461
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:50,640
(From the information center to elephant observatory)

462
00:19:51,607 --> 00:19:53,374
Did you arrive at the observatory for elephants?

463
00:19:53,374 --> 00:19:54,774
- I liked this spot the most. / - We got close then...

464
00:19:54,774 --> 00:19:58,007
We walked since we couldn't take the car.

465
00:19:58,140 --> 00:19:59,474
What is that, by the way?

466
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:02,340
"Deer hit people."

467
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:03,974
- Oh, that? / - Hey, deer...

468
00:20:04,307 --> 00:20:05,940
- It said so over there. / - They don't hit you.

469
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:08,007
The deer is giving him a high-five.

470
00:20:08,007 --> 00:20:09,340
It's giving him a high-five?

471
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:12,540
A deer can give high-fives?

472
00:20:12,874 --> 00:20:15,374
Goodness, Mina. You're quite the joker.

473
00:20:16,607 --> 00:20:18,674
When deer try to high-five you, dodge them.

474
00:20:18,974 --> 00:20:21,207
- What if deer hit me? / - You'll be fine.

475
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:22,774
Come on.

476
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:26,140
- Look, Isn't it nice? / - This is nice.

477
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:28,340
The scenery is out of this world, right?

478
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:29,874
Yes, it's beautiful indeed.

479
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:31,607
Gosh, this place...

480
00:20:31,607 --> 00:20:32,707
(The unobstructed scenery comforts them)

481
00:20:32,707 --> 00:20:34,374
It's a music video.

482
00:20:34,374 --> 00:20:35,940
You could hear the grass swaying.

483
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:37,974
You could hear the bugs and birds chirping too.

484
00:20:38,074 --> 00:20:40,940
You could hear numerous kinds of birds chirping.

485
00:20:41,274 --> 00:20:43,640
The sound of the chirping was enough to comfort me.

486
00:20:45,007 --> 00:20:47,007
Look at the clouds. They're hanging...

487
00:20:47,007 --> 00:20:48,440
- Right next to us, right? / - Yes.

488
00:20:48,807 --> 00:20:52,840
Elephants should be coming from there.

489
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:54,374
(This meadow calls for a herd of elephants)

490
00:20:54,374 --> 00:20:56,840
- That'd be dangerous. / - You must run if you see them.

491
00:20:58,707 --> 00:20:59,974
That must be the observatory.

492
00:21:00,874 --> 00:21:02,074
- Right? / - Over there.

493
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:03,607
- But... / - The observatory.

494
00:21:03,607 --> 00:21:05,774
- There's an observatory. / - It's not dangerous.

495
00:21:05,774 --> 00:21:08,307
- But you don't want to startle the elephants.

496
00:21:08,307 --> 00:21:09,840
That could lead to accidents.

497
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:11,307
Gosh, I love this place.

498
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:13,807
- Eunhye, come here. / - Yes?

499
00:21:15,007 --> 00:21:17,907
- Where? / - Can you see a red puddle there?

500
00:21:17,907 --> 00:21:19,640
- That? / - Let me explain about that puddle.

501
00:21:20,274 --> 00:21:22,940
Herds of elephants come, eat the salt and leave.

502
00:21:23,307 --> 00:21:25,040
It'd be nice to see the elephants

503
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:26,474
but we probably won't, right?

504
00:21:26,574 --> 00:21:28,507
I guess they come once in a while.

505
00:21:28,774 --> 00:21:31,574
Apparently you have to be really lucky to see them.

506
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:34,207
- It must be rare. / - Don't you think we're lucky?

507
00:21:39,174 --> 00:21:44,807
(They wait for the elephants)

508
00:21:44,807 --> 00:21:45,874
- You had to keep waiting? / - Yes.

509
00:21:45,874 --> 00:21:47,640
- It's a sad song. / - The sounds of birds chirping...

510
00:21:48,574 --> 00:21:51,274
(The cruel elephants don't show up)

511

512
00:21:53,107 --> 00:21:54,107
will this get edited out?

513
00:22:01,707 --> 00:22:04,440
- They're not coming. / - The fact that I was first...

514
00:22:04,674 --> 00:22:07,540
To come here and know about this place is my luck.

515
00:22:09,074 --> 00:22:13,107
(We hope that you will be lucky to meet elephants)

516
00:22:13,107 --> 00:22:14,607
- They didn't see elephants. / - You didn't see them?

517
00:22:14,607 --> 00:22:16,807
- You didn't see them. / - We didn't see them there.

518
00:22:17,174 --> 00:22:19,240
- Gosh. / - That lacks the finishing touch.

00:22:37,907 --> 00:22:39,740
- Where? / - A deer! It's on your right.

528
00:22:40,107 --> 00:22:41,940
- The deer is eating grass. / - You're right.

529
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:45,507
You know, it's not a deer we usually think of.

530
00:22:45,507 --> 00:22:46,774
It's a wild deer.

531
00:22:46,774 --> 00:22:48,674
- It will kick us if we get close. / - Yes.

532
00:22:51,474 --> 00:22:52,807
Will it run at us?

533
00:22:52,907 --> 00:22:54,807
But it looks so pretty.

534
00:22:56,307 --> 00:22:59,607
They preserved nature as much as they can.

535
00:22:59,607 --> 00:23:02,040
- Deer come here and eat grass. / - Precisely.

536
00:23:02,374 --> 00:23:04,407
Are we still watching it because it's a wild deer?

537
00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:06,774
Deer!

538
00:23:07,174 --> 00:23:08,774
Look over here.

539
00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:11,074
- It looked at us. Hi. / - It really looked at us.

540
00:23:11,707 --> 00:23:15,174
- Whenever we met animals... / - Hi.

541
00:23:15,507 --> 00:23:18,040
- It was wonderful. / - Stay healthy.

542
00:23:18,307 --> 00:23:19,807
It was moving too.

543
00:23:19,807 --> 00:23:21,374
(An Park Tour's handbook on animals in Khao Yai)

544
00:23:21,374 --> 00:23:24,140
- This part looks like a real jungle. / - Right?

545
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:25,707
It's so quiet here.

546
00:23:25,807 --> 00:23:28,140
Since not that many people know about this place...

547
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:30,007
- It's better because it's quiet. / - I agree.

548
00:23:30,174 --> 00:23:31,940
We get to experience the real nature here.

549
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:34,440
- We can't with crowds of people. / - Exactly.

550
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:35,507
We'll only see people here.

551
00:23:35,507 --> 00:23:37,474
Eunhye, I have a confession to make.

552
00:23:37,574 --> 00:23:38,907
I have a confession to make.

553
00:23:39,074 --> 00:23:42,007
The truth is that, to see this waterfall,

554
00:23:42,007 --> 00:23:43,807
we must climb down 190 steps.

555
00:23:44,540 --> 00:23:47,107
- You have to climb back up. / - You must climb up.

556
00:23:48,140 --> 00:23:50,674
- It's called Haew Narok Waterfall. / - 190 steps?

557
00:23:52,674 --> 00:23:54,274
(Is this really happening?)

558
00:23:54,274 --> 00:23:55,807
We're as good as dead.

559
00:23:55,974 --> 00:23:57,707
- It's the steps from hell. / - Exactly.

560
00:23:58,340 --> 00:23:59,607
- The steps are steep too. / - Goodness.

561
00:23:59,607 --> 00:24:00,374
Rather than the waterfall from hell,

562
00:24:00,374 --> 00:24:02,040
the steps are from hell.

563
00:24:02,374 --> 00:24:04,507
Eunhye, since the steps are steep, be careful.

564
00:24:04,507 --> 00:24:06,174
- We might slip. / - Yes.

565
00:24:06,807 --> 00:24:08,974
Eunhye, hold onto the railing. Eunhye?

566
00:24:09,207 --> 00:24:10,440
Are you alright?

567
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:12,440
Are you alright? You can't do this?

568
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:14,974
The steps are getting steeper.

569
00:24:14,974 --> 00:24:16,474
I hate this.

570
00:24:17,307 --> 00:24:20,007
(The steps are extremely steep)

571
00:24:21,074 --> 00:24:23,574
- Watch out. / - Focus on you. It's dangerous.

572
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:24,807
Okay.

573
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:30,240
(Only those who climb down 190 steps can see)

574
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:31,474
Amazing.

575
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:34,340
I felt bad that I hesitated climbing down the steps.

576
00:24:34,507 --> 00:24:36,474
- That looks incredible. / - This looks awesome!

577
00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:39,674
We were so moved when we saw the waterfall.

578
00:24:40,274 --> 00:24:42,640
We realized that the steps were there for a reason.

579
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:44,307
- It wouldn't be great without them. / - Right.

580
00:24:44,374 --> 00:24:45,674
It must've been so cool there.

581
00:24:45,674 --> 00:24:46,840
There's so much water.

582
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:49,440
You have to come during the monsoon to see this.

583
00:24:49,574 --> 00:24:50,874
Look over there.

584
00:24:50,874 --> 00:24:53,974
During the monsoon season, the elephants...

585
00:24:54,774 --> 00:24:56,840
Were swept down along this waterfall.

586
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:58,907
That's why it's called the waterfall from hell.

587
00:24:58,907 --> 00:25:01,440
I can see how an elephant can get swept away.

588
00:25:03,207 --> 00:25:04,807
I've never seen...

589
00:25:04,807 --> 00:25:06,440
- Something huge like this. / - Me too.

590
00:25:09,574 --> 00:25:11,274
This trip is really interesting.

591
00:25:11,274 --> 00:25:13,207
It makes me stare at things for a while.

592
00:25:13,574 --> 00:25:16,974
Usually, I look at things very briefly.

593
00:25:17,607 --> 00:25:20,007
But this makes you want to stay.

594
00:25:20,074 --> 00:25:22,440
The elephant observatory did that to me too.

595
00:25:22,574 --> 00:25:24,374
There's something about this place.

596
00:25:24,374 --> 00:25:26,407
- Right? / - Seriously.

597
00:25:26,707 --> 00:25:29,174
Here, you can feel happiness

598
00:25:29,174 --> 00:25:30,574
when you do nothing.

599
00:25:31,574 --> 00:25:32,674
Let's go.

600
00:25:34,174 --> 00:25:35,640
Not just anyone can see it.

601
00:25:36,174 --> 00:25:38,674
- You have to earn it. / - That's right.

602
00:25:39,807 --> 00:25:40,807
We're crawling.

603
00:25:40,807 --> 00:25:42,707
Goodness, you have to climb up.

604
00:25:42,707 --> 00:25:45,774
(They have to suffer climbing up after the waterfall)

605
00:25:45,774 --> 00:25:46,907
We're crawling.

606
00:25:47,540 --> 00:25:50,474
- Still. You have to see it, right? / - It was so moving.

607
00:25:50,474 --> 00:25:51,907
- Of course. / - You must go.

608
00:25:51,907 --> 00:25:53,874
(Khao Yai National Park)

609
00:25:54,674 --> 00:25:57,240
(They're off to see the night safari)

610
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:58,540
There must be something over there.

611
00:25:59,174 --> 00:26:00,840
People are taking pictures.

612
00:26:01,507 --> 00:26:02,607
What is it?

613
00:26:03,707 --> 00:26:04,840
(It's out, come here)

614
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:05,940
What is it?

615
00:26:07,374 --> 00:26:11,407
- Look over there. / - What is it?

616
00:26:15,674 --> 00:26:18,440
Elephant! That's an elephant!

617
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:20,707
- It's an elephant. / - It's so cool.

618
00:26:21,474 --> 00:26:22,574
Goodness.

619
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:25,207
It makes an entrance like

620
00:26:25,207 --> 00:26:26,807
this is a theater or something.

621
00:26:26,807 --> 00:26:27,974
As if it was all planned.

622
00:26:31,507 --> 00:26:34,240
Elephant! That's an elephant!

623
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:38,374
It's so big. I'm afraid to go out.

624
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:43,540
- I want to see it up close. / - It's really big.

625
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:45,440
- It's huge. / - It is.

626
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:47,407
Don't Thai people love elephants?

627
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:49,240
It's a symbol of good fortune.

628
00:26:49,374 --> 00:26:50,640
It's really huge.

629
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:53,240
The elephant moves slower than I thought.

630
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:54,574
It walks slowly.

631
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:56,174
She's following the elephant.

632
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:04,274
She looks really startled.

633
00:27:04,407 --> 00:27:05,474
It's so scary.

634
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:07,974
Did you see that? The elephant is so charismatic.

635
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:10,974
Did you see it raise its foot? Unbelievable.

636
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:14,774
Thank goodness he didn't attack.

637
00:27:15,107 --> 00:27:17,707
The way it threatened her was...

638
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:18,907
It's leaving.

639
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:21,074
- You shouldn't leave your car? / - Find your friend.

640
00:27:21,074 --> 00:27:22,307
Of course you shouldn't.

641
00:27:22,307 --> 00:27:24,674
- You saw an elephant. / - Because it's dangerous.

This park is so big. The sun is setting already.

644
00:27:32,140 --> 00:27:33,240
I know.

300 different wild animal species live in that park.

648
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:43,074
- 300? / - Yes.

649
00:27:43,674 --> 00:27:46,440
I'm unfamiliar with night safari.

650
00:27:47,674 --> 00:27:49,074
The night safari is...

651
00:27:49,674 --> 00:27:51,340
One-hour long.

652
00:27:51,807 --> 00:27:54,440
For an hour, we can explore...

653
00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:57,740
- The wild forest at night. / - You can look through it.

654
00:27:58,174 --> 00:28:00,974

656
00:28:05,407 --> 00:28:07,174
There's a porcupine.

658
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:10,307
Over there.

659
00:28:10,407 --> 00:28:12,007
What is it?

660
00:28:12,007 --> 00:28:13,474
- That thing. / - A porcupine.

661
00:28:13,474 --> 00:28:15,174
- It's cute. / - It's a crested porcupine.

662
00:28:15,174 --> 00:28:17,440
I know that. It's a porcupine, right?

- Where? / - It has...

665
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:31,140
Really long, sharp quills.

666
00:28:31,374 --> 00:28:32,974

669

Let's go!

670
00:28:46,807 --> 00:28:48,407
This is kind of...

671
00:28:48,407 --> 00:28:50,507
It's bright here because we have lights.

672
00:28:50,507 --> 00:28:53,440
But look over there. It's scary. It's so dark.

But this... There are wild animals...

676
00:29:00,407 --> 00:29:02,874
- Nocturnal animals. / - Right.

677
00:29:03,074 --> 00:29:07,407
This can't be compared with any other night safari.

678
00:29:08,574 --> 00:29:10,807
I'll remember this for a really long time.

679
00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:13,240
We can't experience something like this easily.

680
00:29:14,007 --> 00:29:15,974

701
00:30:02,974 --> 00:30:04,607
It's over there. It's fruit.

702
00:30:04,607 --> 00:30:06,607
- That's funny. / - I got so scared.

703
00:30:06,607 --> 00:30:08,874
- It fell on my head. / - It dropped on Mina's head.

00:30:08,874 --> 00:30:10,740
- But Eunhye got more scared. / - Exactly.

705
00:30:10,740 --> 00:30:11,907
(Eunhye wins the Best Coward Award)

706
00:30:13,340 --> 00:30:14,607
I was thinking,

707
00:30:14,607 --> 00:30:18,074
"What if a snake falls from the tree?"

708
00:30:18,407 --> 00:30:21,107
And that dropped right onto my head.

709
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:22,607
I got so scared.

710
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:28,640
(The vehicles suddenly stop)

711
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:29,807
There must be something.

712
00:30:30,307 --> 00:30:31,374
What is it?

713
00:30:33,007 --> 00:30:35,140
What's that? There's something small.

714
00:30:35,140 --> 00:30:36,840
I think it's an owl. It's really small.

715
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:39,440
- It's a wild owl. / - I love owls.

716
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:41,407
Why is an owl on the ground?

717
00:30:41,407 --> 00:30:43,474
What's funny is that it's right by a lake.

718
00:30:43,874 --> 00:30:46,140
Why is it sitting by a lake

719
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:47,940
instead of on a tree?

720
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:49,407
It must be a sad owl.

721
00:30:49,407 --> 00:30:51,607
- It's so cute. / - Maybe it's there to drink water.

722
00:30:51,740 --> 00:30:54,374
I wonder why it's sitting there in the dark.

723
00:30:54,374 --> 00:30:56,640
I think it's amazing

724
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:59,040
that we get to see an owl in the wilderness.

725
00:30:59,207 --> 00:31:02,740
You never know what animals you'll get to see.

726
00:31:03,574 --> 00:31:06,440
- It's all luck. / - Yes, it is.

727
00:31:06,707 --> 00:31:09,640
I'm not afraid anymore. I want to find something.

728
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:11,840
It's like finding hidden pictures.

729
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:13,674
I want to find more

730
00:31:13,674 --> 00:31:15,207
and see more animals.

731
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:16,374
- You're right. / - Yes.

732
00:31:16,874 --> 00:31:20,340
Animals you see in the wild feel different.

733
00:31:20,340 --> 00:31:22,640
I thought they'd be violent.

734
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:24,674
- But they're actually gentle. / - Right.

735
00:31:24,674 --> 00:31:26,807
As long as we don't provoke them,

736
00:31:26,807 --> 00:31:28,874
they go about their business.

737
00:31:29,207 --> 00:31:31,207
People shouldn't be locked up in the house.

738
00:31:31,207 --> 00:31:33,540
They should be free and they should go traveling.

739
00:31:33,940 --> 00:31:37,440
- That'll give you peace of mind. / - Yes.

740
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:40,507
If you're home all day, you become high-strung.

741
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:44,907
There is...

742
00:31:45,140 --> 00:31:46,240
What is it?

743
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:47,740
There's something.

744
00:31:48,107 --> 00:31:49,807
- The eyes are shining. / - Is it deer?

745
00:31:49,807 --> 00:31:50,874
- It's a fox. / - What's that?

746
00:31:50,874 --> 00:31:53,407
The eyes were shining bright.

747
00:31:53,407 --> 00:31:55,074
- It's a deer, a male deer. / - It's a stag.

748
00:31:55,074 --> 00:31:56,340
- It's so pretty. / - Amazing.

749
00:31:56,474 --> 00:31:58,440
- Awesome. / - It has antlers.

750
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:00,140
I've never seen one with antlers.

751
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:03,240
- It's huge. / - It's so pretty.

752
00:32:03,307 --> 00:32:04,540
- What's that? / - What is that?

753
00:32:04,540 --> 00:32:06,340
- That's fun. / - Isn't it?

754
00:32:06,540 --> 00:32:08,707
- It's fun to look for things. / - Yes.

755
00:32:08,707 --> 00:32:10,340
(A doe is right beside it)

756
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:13,840
You never get to see animals at night. This is cool.

757
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:30,474
(The crested porcupines appear again)

758
00:32:32,574 --> 00:32:33,940
What's that? Is that a fox?

759
00:32:34,407 --> 00:32:36,407
- A civet. / - Is civet a wild animal?

760
00:32:37,207 --> 00:32:39,140
- They say seeing a civet is... / - Yes.

761
00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:40,940
As rare as seeing an elephant.

762
00:32:40,940 --> 00:32:42,074
This is awesome.

763
00:32:42,574 --> 00:32:43,707
Amazing.

764
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:45,540
We saw a civet too.

765
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:47,007
An hour is too short.

766
00:32:47,307 --> 00:32:48,774
You saw a lot of things in an hour.

767
00:32:48,774 --> 00:32:50,374
But it went by too quickly.

768
00:32:51,974 --> 00:32:54,407
The view is unbelievable.

769
00:32:54,407 --> 00:32:55,740
It's pretty.

770
00:32:55,740 --> 00:32:57,674
Everything is so green.

771
00:32:57,674 --> 00:32:59,274
(This time, they go outside the park)

772
00:32:59,740 --> 00:33:02,407
- It's the oldest and largest... / - Winery?

773
00:33:03,207 --> 00:33:05,174
It's so nice in here.

774
00:33:05,174 --> 00:33:06,207
Ta-da!

775
00:33:06,207 --> 00:33:08,607
Wow, this really feels like Italy.

776
00:33:08,607 --> 00:33:09,740
This is it.

777
00:33:10,007 --> 00:33:11,574
So cute.

778
00:33:11,574 --> 00:33:13,040
You know alpacas.

779
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:14,207
It's an alpaca.

780
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:18,674
- I'm hungry. / - That looks good.

781
00:33:18,674 --> 00:33:20,707
I have to take photos.

782
00:33:20,707 --> 00:33:22,507
- That looks good. / - Wow.

783
00:33:22,507 --> 00:33:23,674
- That looks good. / - Goodness.

784
00:33:23,674 --> 00:33:24,874
That was so good.

785
00:33:24,874 --> 00:33:26,707
- What's that? / - You eat so well.

786
00:33:26,707 --> 00:33:28,240
It's so good.

787
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:29,907
Is it good?

788
00:33:29,907 --> 00:33:32,307
- The pork looks good. / - It's really delicious.

789
00:33:32,307 --> 00:33:34,340
I'd want to come back for this.

790
00:33:34,507 --> 00:33:35,574
(An Park Tour)

791
00:33:35,574 --> 00:33:37,607
Now it's the Park side of the tour.

792
00:33:37,607 --> 00:33:39,907
(Primo Piazza)

793
00:33:40,174 --> 00:33:42,840
This place is so pretty. What is this place?

794
00:33:43,074 --> 00:33:45,707
Aren't you reminded of someplace?

795
00:33:46,807 --> 00:33:47,974
Europe?

796
00:33:48,540 --> 00:33:50,274
Tuscany. Italy!

797
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:55,640
Look at this. This is a place for me.

798
00:33:56,007 --> 00:33:57,507
A place for you?

799
00:33:57,507 --> 00:33:59,974
- For you. / - Petit Italy in Thailand.

800
00:33:59,974 --> 00:34:01,507
Primo Piazza.

801
00:34:02,074 --> 00:34:03,340
This is it.

802
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:06,607
Wow, this is so...

803
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:09,174
This is just like Italy.

804
00:34:09,940 --> 00:34:11,640
- It's pretty. / - This is...

805
00:34:12,940 --> 00:34:16,607
Small towns in Italy have red roofs like this.

806
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:18,174
Florence is like this too.

807
00:34:18,940 --> 00:34:20,140
Seriously.

808
00:34:20,674 --> 00:34:23,840
Enjoying the scorching sun of Europe,

809
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:26,040
walking leisurely in the streets...

810
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:29,140
And drinking tea.

811
00:34:29,340 --> 00:34:35,507
I want to go to a place like Europe, a peaceful place.

812
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:39,074
(Mina, I want to go to Europe)

813
00:34:39,674 --> 00:34:42,474
Eunhye's husband, please let your wife travel.

814
00:34:44,607 --> 00:34:47,007
The first half of the trip is about adventure.

815
00:34:47,274 --> 00:34:49,740
- Yes, adventure. / - It makes you adventurous.

816
00:34:49,740 --> 00:34:50,907
The last half of the trip is...

817
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:52,940
- About romance. / - Let's do this.

818
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:54,007
Romance?

819
00:34:54,007 --> 00:34:55,474
With you?

820
00:34:55,974 --> 00:34:58,807
- No, I mean just the vibe. / - I see.

821
00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:03,107
This is Primo Piazza. Made to look just like Europe.

822
00:35:03,107 --> 00:35:06,174
I love the orange roofs.

823
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:07,174
It makes me feel at ease.

824
00:35:07,174 --> 00:35:09,307
What do you think? Does it look similar to Italy?

825
00:35:09,307 --> 00:35:12,574
I haven't been to Tuscany, so it's hard to tell

826
00:35:12,574 --> 00:35:15,740
but it's very beautiful and peaceful.

827
00:35:15,740 --> 00:35:19,274
- It feels like we're in a painting. / - It does.

828
00:35:19,274 --> 00:35:23,074
The buildings are orange, so when the sun shines...

829
00:35:23,074 --> 00:35:24,840
You can take great pictures there.

830
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:28,440
- Asians look nicer in orange color. / - How adorable.

831
00:35:28,974 --> 00:35:30,440
Yesterday, in the national park...

832
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:33,274
It's hard to believe that it's Thailand.

833
00:35:33,274 --> 00:35:34,440
It is, isn't it?

834
00:35:35,507 --> 00:35:38,240
You can do many things there.

835
00:35:38,907 --> 00:35:40,807
There's a donkey over there. It's so cute.

836
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:42,640
- Where? / - There's a donkey over there.

837
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:44,840
- It's like the one from "Shrek." / - I see it.

838
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:46,240
It's so cute.

839
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:48,274
- Donkeys are so small. / - It's a donkey.

840
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:51,140
It's so small.

841
00:35:51,607 --> 00:35:53,474
(What other animals are there?)

842
00:35:54,607 --> 00:35:56,574
(Goats and donkeys)

843
00:35:57,340 --> 00:35:58,707
Alpacas.

844
00:35:58,707 --> 00:36:01,107
- It's so cute. / - Such beautiful eyeliner.

845
00:36:01,107 --> 00:36:02,274
It's very good-looking.

846
00:36:02,607 --> 00:36:04,540
I was so happy because it was so cute.

847
00:36:06,207 --> 00:36:08,840
Alright. I'll feed you soon. Wait there.

848
00:36:09,674 --> 00:36:12,107
(The entrance and the feeding fee, $8.70)

849
00:36:13,007 --> 00:36:14,907
Look at its teeth. They look so funny.

850
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:18,974
- It's out here. / - It has funny teeth.

851
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:22,174
Its teeth look like Yu Jaeseok's.

852
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:23,474
Don't you think so?

853
00:36:23,474 --> 00:36:25,007
It's sticking out.

854
00:36:27,107 --> 00:36:29,540
- It doesn't have upper teeth. / - Really?

855
00:36:29,540 --> 00:36:32,074
- It only has lower teeth. / - Can it chew food?

856
00:36:32,074 --> 00:36:33,240
That's very interesting.

857
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:37,674
- They want the food. / - They look so nice.

858
00:36:37,674 --> 00:36:39,340
- They are nice. / - They were so cute.

859
00:36:39,340 --> 00:36:41,040
I want to have one.

860
00:36:41,307 --> 00:36:42,640
They're having a hearty meal.

861
00:36:43,274 --> 00:36:46,407
(Mina and Eunhye feed the goats)

862
00:36:47,107 --> 00:36:50,674
This is fascinating. It feels like this is my first time

863
00:36:50,674 --> 00:36:52,074
seeing animals here.

864
00:36:52,074 --> 00:36:54,074
Eunhye, didn't it remind you of your children?

865
00:36:54,074 --> 00:36:55,307
It totally did.

866
00:36:55,507 --> 00:36:56,507
All of a sudden?

867
00:36:59,507 --> 00:37:02,807
There is a photo spot here. Let's take great pictures.

868
00:37:02,807 --> 00:37:04,440
- Pardon? / - Let's take great pictures.

869
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:06,907
I think we can take a lot of good pictures here.

870
00:37:08,474 --> 00:37:10,574
It's hard to tell who the flower is.

871
00:37:11,140 --> 00:37:12,740
Shall we take a picture?

872
00:37:14,340 --> 00:37:15,874
(It's impossible to take bad pictures here)

873
00:37:15,874 --> 00:37:18,307
- You look so cute. / - It's pretty.

874
00:37:18,307 --> 00:37:19,307
(An Park Tour over flowers)

875
00:37:20,507 --> 00:37:22,007
- You took great pictures. / - Yes.

876
00:37:22,007 --> 00:37:24,107
- It's pretty and nice here. / - The sky looks so nice.

877
00:37:24,107 --> 00:37:25,474
But shouldn't we go eat?

878
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:27,940
We should. We're going to

879
00:37:27,940 --> 00:37:29,440
a restaurant where you can please all five senses.

880
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:32,107
If you look, we're not sweating.

881
00:37:32,340 --> 00:37:34,640
It was warm and the sky was clear...

882
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:35,874
- But we didn't sweat. / - Is it cool there?

883
00:37:36,207 --> 00:37:39,540
(Museum restaurant)

884
00:37:40,107 --> 00:37:42,107
It's convenient to have a rental car.

885
00:37:42,107 --> 00:37:43,574
It is.

886
00:37:43,574 --> 00:37:44,574
(35 minutes from Primo Piazza to museum restaurant)

887
00:37:46,174 --> 00:37:47,540
Aren't you scared?

888
00:37:47,540 --> 00:37:48,840
- Pardon? / - Aren't you scared of these things?

889
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:50,540
- Are you scared? / - No, I'm fine.

890
00:37:50,807 --> 00:37:53,307
It feels like a whole different country here.

891
00:37:53,307 --> 00:37:56,240
Is this a shopping mall?

892
00:37:57,240 --> 00:37:58,907
Have a look around.

893
00:37:59,974 --> 00:38:03,240
They're selling antique items.

894
00:38:03,707 --> 00:38:05,874
(You'll be fascinated already at the entrance)

895
00:38:06,974 --> 00:38:08,140
(There are various characters and miniatures there)

896
00:38:08,140 --> 00:38:09,140
What is that?

897
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:13,007
(It's a museum restaurant)

898
00:38:13,007 --> 00:38:14,274
Is it an arcade?

899
00:38:14,274 --> 00:38:16,407
It's a museum and a restaurant at the same time.

900
00:38:16,407 --> 00:38:17,407
That's right.

901
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:19,540
I'm good at this.

902
00:38:20,007 --> 00:38:20,540
Are you good at this?

903
00:38:20,540 --> 00:38:21,874
I'm good at it on the computer.

904
00:38:21,874 --> 00:38:23,907
- On the computer? / - I have this on my computer.

905
00:38:23,907 --> 00:38:25,707
It's almost antique.

906
00:38:25,707 --> 00:38:27,607
It is. It must be really old.

907
00:38:27,607 --> 00:38:29,007
I wonder where they found it.

908
00:38:29,007 --> 00:38:30,640
These are yo-yos.

909
00:38:31,307 --> 00:38:33,640
- They are yo-yos. / - There are different kinds.

910
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:34,907
Are those matches?

911
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:36,274
Are those matches?

912
00:38:36,274 --> 00:38:38,540
Children would love this place.

913
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:41,807
The inside is way bigger than we thought.

914
00:38:41,807 --> 00:38:43,407
They are cars.

915
00:38:43,574 --> 00:38:45,540
Look at this. There is a ski lift as well.

916
00:38:46,540 --> 00:38:48,007
Do they sell those?

917
00:38:48,007 --> 00:38:50,240
No, it's the collection of the owner.

918
00:38:50,774 --> 00:38:52,040
It's an exhibition.

919
00:38:52,174 --> 00:38:54,074
They're so pretty.

920
00:38:54,074 --> 00:38:55,207
No matter how old you are,

921
00:38:55,207 --> 00:38:57,074
there are many things to see for everyone.

922
00:38:57,074 --> 00:38:59,540
Maybe the food was bad?

923
00:38:59,874 --> 00:39:03,074
You'll see. It was delicious.

924
00:39:03,074 --> 00:39:05,474
- It feels like an antique shop. / - It does.

925
00:39:05,474 --> 00:39:07,307
It's like an antique shop.

926
00:39:07,307 --> 00:39:11,174
It feels very exotic to eat in a place like this.

927
00:39:11,174 --> 00:39:12,507
That's why I picked this place.

928
00:39:12,507 --> 00:39:13,907
I like this place.

929
00:39:13,907 --> 00:39:17,974
Khao Yai seems very international.

930
00:39:17,974 --> 00:39:21,040
There are various things here. It's full of colors.

931
00:39:21,407 --> 00:39:22,574
Whenever you take me to a place,

932
00:39:22,574 --> 00:39:24,307
I feel like I'm in a different city.

933
00:39:24,307 --> 00:39:25,407
- You're right. / - Right?

934
00:39:25,407 --> 00:39:27,807
- I'm so hungry. / - I know.

935
00:39:27,807 --> 00:39:29,007
Please get me some food.

936
00:39:29,007 --> 00:39:31,640
Here, we're going to eat what you've been craving...

937
00:39:32,007 --> 00:39:33,774
We'll eat crabs.

938
00:39:34,007 --> 00:39:36,574
- We can eat crabs here? / - Yes.

939
00:39:36,574 --> 00:39:37,574
Please hurry up.

940
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:39,174
- Hello. / - Hello.

941
00:39:39,707 --> 00:39:42,074
We'd like to order a black pepper crab...

942
00:39:42,740 --> 00:39:44,007
I was too hungry.

943
00:39:44,707 --> 00:39:45,874
She's become sensitive.

944
00:39:47,074 --> 00:39:48,974
- That's famous there. / - What is this?

945
00:39:48,974 --> 00:39:51,174
It's pork skewers.

946
00:39:51,174 --> 00:39:52,907
- Here we are. / - I see.

947
00:39:53,374 --> 00:39:56,174
By the way, where is the black pepper crab?

948
00:39:57,507 --> 00:39:58,874
It's not served yet. Gosh.

949
00:39:59,274 --> 00:40:00,974
We don't have black pepper crab.

950
00:40:01,707 --> 00:40:04,474
What I want to eat is a big crab.

951
00:40:04,474 --> 00:40:06,507
- Let's eat first and then talk. / - I should try it first?

952
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:09,440
I'm really curious about this.

953
00:40:10,374 --> 00:40:12,674
- How could this... / - That is the dish?

954
00:40:13,174 --> 00:40:15,440
I see crabs.

955
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:16,940
Isn't it too small?

956
00:40:16,940 --> 00:40:19,240
- It was so delicious. / - My goodness.

957
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:20,340
(Eunhye starts to look for the crab)

958
00:40:20,340 --> 00:40:21,807
It's a soft-shell crab.

959
00:40:21,807 --> 00:40:24,707
- You can eat the shell too. / - You can eat it whole.

960
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:27,340
It is a crab.

961
00:40:27,340 --> 00:40:28,807
(The crab's legs are tiny)

962
00:40:29,207 --> 00:40:30,974
It kind of looks like a Chinese dish.

963
00:40:31,407 --> 00:40:33,540
(She can put the whole crab in her mouth)

964
00:40:34,574 --> 00:40:36,640
(It is a crab indeed)

965
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:37,774
What do you think?

966
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:41,040
(How does black pepper crab taste?)

967
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:42,040
Do you like it?

968
00:40:44,707 --> 00:40:45,774
- Do you like it? / - Yes.

969
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:48,807
This is the soft-shell crab I was looking for.

970
00:40:49,007 --> 00:40:50,007
- Is it? / - Yes.

971
00:40:50,507 --> 00:40:52,007
I'm so relieved now.

972
00:40:52,707 --> 00:40:53,874
This is so delicious.

973
00:40:53,874 --> 00:40:57,374
Soft-shell crabs have very soft shells.

974
00:40:57,374 --> 00:40:59,807
So you can eat the whole crab with the shells.

975
00:40:59,807 --> 00:41:02,340
- It looks delicious. / - It was very delicious.

976
00:41:02,340 --> 00:41:03,340
It'd go well with plain rice.

977
00:41:03,340 --> 00:41:05,607
I tried it with curry before

978
00:41:05,607 --> 00:41:07,574
but with black pepper sauce,

979
00:41:07,574 --> 00:41:10,174
it's salty and spicy.

980
00:41:10,174 --> 00:41:12,374
There's a Chinese dish called stir-fried bok choy.

981
00:41:12,374 --> 00:41:15,574
- I know. / - It tastes similar to that.

982
00:41:15,574 --> 00:41:17,374
This one smells more like seafood.

983
00:41:17,374 --> 00:41:18,774
Is it cooked with oyster sauce?

984
00:41:20,107 --> 00:41:21,174
What is this?

985
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:23,640
This looks like...

986
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:27,307
One of the herbal pills that help with digestion.

987
00:41:27,307 --> 00:41:28,674
It's exactly as small as this.

988
00:41:28,674 --> 00:41:30,840
You normally take 30 pieces.

989
00:41:31,207 --> 00:41:32,207
Let me try it.

990
00:41:36,407 --> 00:41:38,440
(Curious)

991
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:42,140
(What is this?)

992
00:41:45,207 --> 00:41:46,207
Thai...

993
00:41:46,207 --> 00:41:48,140
(Her mouth burns)

994
00:41:48,140 --> 00:41:49,974
As time goes by, it becomes spicier.

995
00:41:49,974 --> 00:41:51,140
It does.

996
00:41:51,140 --> 00:41:52,874
We ate it raw.

997
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:54,974
These are real peppercorns.

998
00:41:54,974 --> 00:41:56,574
I've never seen peppercorns before.

999
00:41:57,840 --> 00:41:58,840
Should we try it?

1000
00:42:04,074 --> 00:42:06,874
(They spat it out right away because it was too spicy)

1001
00:42:08,140 --> 00:42:09,474
(They all shared the same experience)

1002
00:42:12,474 --> 00:42:13,840
You ate the whole thing?

1003
00:42:13,940 --> 00:42:15,840
- No, I had only one piece of it. / - That's a relief.

1004
00:42:16,274 --> 00:42:19,607
It's spicier after you eat it.

1005
00:42:19,607 --> 00:42:21,807
My tongue starts to burn.

1006
00:42:21,807 --> 00:42:23,674
When the peppercorn pops in your mouth and

1007
00:42:23,674 --> 00:42:25,474
touches your tongue,

1008
00:42:25,474 --> 00:42:31,007
it slowly starts to burn the inside...

1009
00:42:32,307 --> 00:42:33,540
- Let's try the green curry. / - Okay.

1010
00:42:33,540 --> 00:42:35,674
- It was very delicious. / - This looks delicious.

1011
00:42:38,940 --> 00:42:42,640
(What does green curry taste like?)

1012
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:44,907
That should be delicious. Curry with rice.

1013
00:42:45,107 --> 00:42:46,374
I put the rice into the curry as we eat rice

1014
00:42:46,374 --> 00:42:48,074
and soup in Korea.

1015
00:42:48,407 --> 00:42:50,707
- There's red chili pepper. / - It was a hangover relief.

1016
00:42:51,140 --> 00:42:53,507
(Thailand is famous for its spicy red chili peppers)

1017
00:42:53,507 --> 00:42:55,907
- So it's a bit spicy. / - It's a little spicy.

1018
00:42:55,907 --> 00:42:57,374
- It's a little spicy. / - Because of the chili pepper.

1019
00:42:57,374 --> 00:43:00,340
It's very spicy.

1020
00:43:04,174 --> 00:43:06,174
(If it's spicy, it should be good)

1021
00:43:07,974 --> 00:43:11,140
Curry tastes different in every country.

1022
00:43:11,274 --> 00:43:13,840
Thai curry has a flavor of

1023
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:16,874
leaves, lime and coconut.

1024
00:43:16,907 --> 00:43:19,574
It has such flavors.

1025
00:43:20,174 --> 00:43:22,240
- It's different from Korean curry. / - It looks delicious.

1026
00:43:22,374 --> 00:43:24,740
- It was delicious. / - If you like these flavors...

1027
00:43:24,740 --> 00:43:26,807
You will love this dish.

1028
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:29,640
You should eat the curry with rice

1029
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:31,340
as if you eat instant noodles soup with rice.

1030
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:36,774
- It looks delicious. / - It was very delicious.

1031
00:43:37,974 --> 00:43:42,174
(There was much to see and the food was great)

1032
00:43:42,174 --> 00:43:43,407
It's very delicious.

1033
00:43:45,674 --> 00:43:46,874
(It's delicious)

1034
00:43:46,874 --> 00:43:49,040
Sikyung, you can eat that the whole night, right?

1035
00:43:49,807 --> 00:43:50,940
I can eat three skewers at once.

1036
00:43:51,974 --> 00:43:53,140
What did you like the most?

1037
00:43:53,140 --> 00:43:55,407
I can't think of anything but the black peppercorns.

1038
00:43:56,140 --> 00:43:58,307
The black peppercorns were shocking.

1039
00:43:58,907 --> 00:44:00,607
Peppercorns are more famous in Phu Quoc.

1040
00:44:00,607 --> 00:44:01,707
That's right.

1041
00:44:01,707 --> 00:44:04,507
Green curry was very delicious

1042
00:44:04,507 --> 00:44:07,374
but I would miss black pepper crab more.

1043
00:44:07,374 --> 00:44:11,040
I think it'll be hard to forget its taste.

1044
00:44:11,274 --> 00:44:13,407
It's probably because of the black peppercorns.

1045
00:44:13,407 --> 00:44:16,107
I can still taste it in my throat.

1046
00:44:16,107 --> 00:44:19,640
Actually so far, I really like the plan you made.

1047
00:44:19,640 --> 00:44:21,174
Will there be more to do here?

1048
00:44:21,174 --> 00:44:23,707
- There's something that you like. / - What I like?

1049
00:44:23,707 --> 00:44:26,207
It's the biggest winery in Khao Yai.

1050
00:44:26,207 --> 00:44:27,540
- Wine? / - Yes.

1051
00:44:27,974 --> 00:44:30,907
A winery in Thailand does sound unfamiliar.

1052
00:44:30,907 --> 00:44:33,674
- It doesn't fit, does it? / - It doesn't.

1053
00:44:33,674 --> 00:44:35,640
(35 minutes by car from restaurant to winery)

1054
00:44:36,807 --> 00:44:40,540
(The very first winery in Thailand, founded in 1989)

1055
00:44:40,540 --> 00:44:44,174
It was founded in 1989. It's quite old.

1056
00:44:44,174 --> 00:44:45,374
Yes.

1057
00:44:45,707 --> 00:44:49,574
It started to win international competitions from 2006.

1058
00:44:50,974 --> 00:44:53,540
We're going on a winery tour on this car.

1059
00:44:53,540 --> 00:44:57,107
- The winery tour only cost $10.70? / - Yes.

1060
00:44:57,507 --> 00:44:59,174
You can try wine there as well.

1061
00:44:59,840 --> 00:45:02,174
The weather is great today.

1062
00:45:02,174 --> 00:45:04,774
- The sky is beautiful. / - It is beautiful.

1063
00:45:05,107 --> 00:45:06,940
It's quite cool here.

1064
00:45:06,940 --> 00:45:08,407
JR, do you drink alcohol?

1065
00:45:08,574 --> 00:45:10,907
Me? I do like drinking.

1066
00:45:10,940 --> 00:45:13,140
I like drinking.

1067
00:45:13,140 --> 00:45:16,040
I don't drink soju. I like wine.

1068
00:45:16,674 --> 00:45:18,340
I like beer.

1069
00:45:18,340 --> 00:45:20,374
- You should go there. / - I know.

1070
00:45:20,374 --> 00:45:23,040
It's a very hot country.

1071
00:45:23,407 --> 00:45:26,640
I didn't know grapes here would taste good.

1072
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:29,307
I didn't think there would be wine here.

1073
00:45:29,307 --> 00:45:31,507
Khao Yai is in the north,

1074
00:45:31,507 --> 00:45:34,574
so it has a good climate for grape farming.

1075
00:45:34,574 --> 00:45:36,874
- That's right. / - What would it taste like?

1076
00:45:36,874 --> 00:45:37,974
I wonder.

1077
00:45:38,674 --> 00:45:40,140
Is this a vineyard?

1078
00:45:40,140 --> 00:45:42,140
You can grow grapes three times a year...

1079
00:45:42,474 --> 00:45:45,174
With the climate here but they grow them once a year.

1080
00:45:45,940 --> 00:45:47,674
It's because the grapes taste the best between

1081
00:45:47,674 --> 00:45:49,807
January and March.

1082
00:45:49,807 --> 00:45:51,540
You can grow grapes three times a year?

1083
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:53,774
It's in the north.

1084
00:45:53,774 --> 00:45:55,640
They can do it because it's cool there.

1085
00:45:57,274 --> 00:45:59,540
(It's the greenhouse where you can see the grapes)

1086
00:45:59,540 --> 00:46:01,007
This is beautiful.

1087
00:46:02,274 --> 00:46:05,840
The grapes in the greenhouse were not ripe yet.

1088
00:46:05,840 --> 00:46:07,207
They were supposed to be sweeter.

1089
00:46:07,207 --> 00:46:08,240
But it was still so good.

1090
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:10,807
- It was so delicious. / - Even when it wasn't ripe?

1091
00:46:10,807 --> 00:46:13,674
- It was not ripe enough. / - How is this possible?

1092
00:46:13,674 --> 00:46:15,340
- It must be delicious. / - It's really...

1093
00:46:15,340 --> 00:46:17,340
(Her eyes are wide open)

1094
00:46:17,374 --> 00:46:18,574
It's so delicious.

1095
00:46:19,074 --> 00:46:21,307
This isn't the taste of grape we know.

1096
00:46:21,574 --> 00:46:23,107
Your eyes have become as big as grapes.

1097
00:46:23,107 --> 00:46:24,307
(Mina also picks one and tries it)

1098
00:46:24,307 --> 00:46:25,874
It was very crunchy.

1099
00:46:25,907 --> 00:46:27,374
It's really delicious.

1100
00:46:27,374 --> 00:46:30,240
- It tastes like green grapes. / - It does.

1101
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:33,340
It's firm and crunchy.

1102
00:46:33,474 --> 00:46:35,907
It's sweet and sour. It's so delicious.

1103
00:46:36,074 --> 00:46:38,640
- Do you remember picking cherries as kids? / - Yes.

1104
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:40,274
That's what it felt like.

1105
00:46:41,774 --> 00:46:44,674
(Now it's time to taste wine)

1106
00:46:46,707 --> 00:46:47,807
It's so...

1107
00:46:47,807 --> 00:46:49,374
(Amazed and impressed)

1108
00:46:49,374 --> 00:46:50,407
This is...

1109
00:46:50,507 --> 00:46:53,840
I already feel tipsy here.

1110
00:46:54,174 --> 00:46:56,740
The smell of oak and wine combined...

1111
00:46:57,074 --> 00:46:58,607
Smells like whiskey.

1112
00:46:58,940 --> 00:47:01,374
It's so pretty.

1113
00:47:01,374 --> 00:47:03,274
(Impressed)

1114
00:47:04,374 --> 00:47:07,940
(They use air conditioning to keep the cellar cool)

1115
00:47:08,574 --> 00:47:12,307
If the temperature is too high, the oak casks explode.

1116
00:47:12,307 --> 00:47:14,274
I guess it will inflate inside.

1117
00:47:14,274 --> 00:47:17,640
This means they make strong wine.

1118
00:47:17,640 --> 00:47:20,074
That's why they have to

1119
00:47:20,074 --> 00:47:22,040
keep it cool here.

1120
00:47:22,040 --> 00:47:24,440
They have different techniques.

1121
00:47:24,440 --> 00:47:27,174
They brew wine in a different way

1122
00:47:27,174 --> 00:47:28,574
which makes me wonder how it would taste.

1123
00:47:28,574 --> 00:47:30,440
(Today, they will taste 3 kinds of wine)

1124
00:47:30,440 --> 00:47:32,040
(Including the winner of 2017 AWC Vienna)

1125
00:47:32,040 --> 00:47:33,574
What did the wine taste like?

1126
00:47:33,574 --> 00:47:34,907
It was very smooth.

1127
00:47:34,907 --> 00:47:37,607
It didn't taste like alcohol at all. It's not sweet either.

1128
00:47:37,607 --> 00:47:40,174
Can you have unlimited wine if you pay for the tour?

1129
00:47:40,174 --> 00:47:42,807
The tour fee includes wine tasting.

1130
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:45,307
This wine is white wine.

1131
00:47:45,540 --> 00:47:47,840
It's made of Chenin blanc grapes.

1132
00:47:48,274 --> 00:47:50,707
(What does Thai wine taste like?)

1133
00:47:50,707 --> 00:47:51,974
It's tasty.

1134
00:47:51,974 --> 00:47:54,174
I actually don't like white wine.

1135
00:47:54,174 --> 00:47:55,707
But this one is very delicious.

1136
00:47:55,874 --> 00:47:57,474
It's not sour.

1137
00:47:57,907 --> 00:48:00,040
It tastes like quality white wine.

1138
00:48:00,340 --> 00:48:04,274
This red wine is made of Shiraz grapes.

1139
00:48:09,907 --> 00:48:11,240
It's so delicious.

1140
00:48:12,274 --> 00:48:14,707
I think this is...

1141
00:48:15,274 --> 00:48:17,207
This makes me cast away the prejudice.

1142
00:48:17,207 --> 00:48:19,207
I always thought

1143
00:48:19,207 --> 00:48:21,740
clear wine doesn't taste good.

1144
00:48:21,740 --> 00:48:23,340
(The wine looks light but it has a rich taste)

1145
00:48:23,574 --> 00:48:26,040
- It's delicious. / - It smells so good.

1146
00:48:27,307 --> 00:48:28,907
This is the last one.

1147
00:48:28,907 --> 00:48:32,240
This one is the gold medalist from AWC Vienna.

1148
00:48:32,607 --> 00:48:34,274
This is the medalist.

1149
00:48:35,974 --> 00:48:39,407
(Mina and Eunhye carefully taste the wine)

1150
00:48:40,207 --> 00:48:42,374
(They focus on the wine)

1151
00:48:42,740 --> 00:48:44,474
This is a prize winner but...

1152
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:47,874
This is probably how it should taste to win a prize.

1153
00:48:48,807 --> 00:48:50,907
- It has a bitter aftertaste. / - Yes, it's bitter.

1154
00:48:50,907 --> 00:48:53,674
It clearly has a bitter taste, yet it's not too heavy.

1155
00:48:53,807 --> 00:48:55,407
Mina, aren't you drinking too much?

1156
00:48:55,407 --> 00:48:57,007
You said you're a problem drinker.

1157
00:48:57,507 --> 00:48:59,874
- She just becomes cute. / - She just becomes cute.

1158
00:48:59,874 --> 00:49:01,140
That should be alright.

1159
00:49:01,274 --> 00:49:02,307
(An Park Tour)

1160
00:49:02,307 --> 00:49:05,640
(Restaurant recommended by locals)

1161
00:49:05,940 --> 00:49:11,574
(35 minutes by car from the winery to the restaurant)

1162
00:49:12,274 --> 00:49:13,807
This looks like a local restaurant.

1163
00:49:13,807 --> 00:49:15,607
There are only Thai customers.

1164
00:49:15,607 --> 00:49:18,107
- You're right. / - It's where locals eat.

1165
00:49:18,174 --> 00:49:19,674
It's a popular restaurant in Thailand.

1166
00:49:19,674 --> 00:49:20,907
It's a popular restaurant.

1167
00:49:22,140 --> 00:49:24,874
Since we're here,

1168
00:49:24,874 --> 00:49:26,174
we should go to a good restaurant.

1169
00:49:26,174 --> 00:49:27,207
I asked the locals in the hotel

1170
00:49:27,207 --> 00:49:29,974
the restaurants they go to.

1171
00:49:29,974 --> 00:49:31,207
And I got some recommendations.

1172
00:49:31,207 --> 00:49:33,107
- You asked the hotel staff? / - Yes.

1173
00:49:33,240 --> 00:49:35,407
- That's a very nice tip. / - I said I don't want to go...

1174
00:49:35,407 --> 00:49:38,307
Anywhere fancy. I asked where he would go eat.

1175
00:49:38,307 --> 00:49:39,574
(The kind staff's recommendation)

1176
00:49:39,574 --> 00:49:42,140
First, you should try yum woon sen.

1177
00:49:42,140 --> 00:49:44,407
I love yum woon sen.

1178
00:49:44,540 --> 00:49:46,674
(1. Yum woon sen, 2. Grilled fish)

1179
00:49:47,807 --> 00:49:50,140
- Okay, thank you. / - Thank you very much.

1180
00:49:50,874 --> 00:49:53,074
I saw something on the way in.

1181
00:49:53,274 --> 00:49:56,174
There's something everyone is eating.

1182
00:49:56,174 --> 00:49:58,540
- It's pork with bones. / - Pork.

1183
00:49:58,774 --> 00:50:02,607
Let's order that and the recommended dish.

1184
00:50:03,074 --> 00:50:03,907
When you go to a restaurant,

1185
00:50:03,907 --> 00:50:05,974
you should look around first.

1186
00:50:05,974 --> 00:50:08,274
You should ask what people are having and order it.

1187
00:50:10,607 --> 00:50:11,940
(This will fill Mina and Eunhye's empty stomachs)

1188
00:50:11,940 --> 00:50:13,774
The fish was delicious as well.

1189
00:50:14,307 --> 00:50:16,240
It does look delicious.

1190
00:50:16,607 --> 00:50:18,607
- What is this? / - This is yum woon sen.

1191
00:50:19,374 --> 00:50:22,607
(A table full of local Thai food)

1192
00:50:22,874 --> 00:50:24,274
Let's try them.

1193
00:50:24,274 --> 00:50:25,940
I'm really excited about the fish dish.

1194
00:50:25,940 --> 00:50:28,340
(They will try the grilled fish first)

1195
00:50:28,340 --> 00:50:29,640
It looks delicious.

1196
00:50:29,674 --> 00:50:32,174
- It looks beautiful. / - This was very delicious.

1197
00:50:32,407 --> 00:50:34,240
- It's fried. / - Look at the price.

1198
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:35,374
It's $8.70.

1199
00:50:36,607 --> 00:50:39,607
(Eunhye tastes it first)

1200
00:50:39,840 --> 00:50:41,074
How is it?

1201
00:50:41,507 --> 00:50:42,574
Is it good?

1202
00:50:42,874 --> 00:50:43,940
Is it good?

1203
00:50:47,407 --> 00:50:49,907
The sauce looks good.

1204
00:50:50,874 --> 00:50:53,274
(What does it taste like?)

1205
00:50:54,907 --> 00:50:56,174
(It's so tasty that it makes you dance and smile)

1206
00:50:56,174 --> 00:50:57,674
What are you doing?

1207
00:50:58,374 --> 00:51:01,140
It tastes like chicken.

1208
00:51:01,340 --> 00:51:02,507
Chicken.

1209
00:51:02,907 --> 00:51:04,607
It's like marinated chicken.

1210
00:51:04,874 --> 00:51:06,107
The meat is so tender.

1211
00:51:06,107 --> 00:51:08,407
Like you said, it's like chicken.

1212
00:51:08,407 --> 00:51:11,974
I thought it'd be fishy but it's really delicious.

1213
00:51:12,540 --> 00:51:13,707
It's crispy on the outside.

1214
00:51:13,707 --> 00:51:15,740
It tastes like filefish jerky.

1215
00:51:16,740 --> 00:51:19,340
It's spicy, sweet and salty.

1216
00:51:19,340 --> 00:51:21,907
- It's crispy and soft. / - It is.

1217
00:51:22,407 --> 00:51:25,474
It smells like a very delicious braised fish dish.

1218
00:51:25,474 --> 00:51:28,374
You're right. The sauce tastes just like braised fish.

1219
00:51:28,674 --> 00:51:30,007
(It's incredibly delicious)

1220
00:51:33,640 --> 00:51:34,974
Look at this.

1221
00:51:35,207 --> 00:51:36,774
- This is really... / - Look at this.

1222
00:51:36,774 --> 00:51:38,307
You should scrape the fruit inside and eat it.

1223
00:51:38,307 --> 00:51:40,374
You're right. There's white fruit inside.

1224
00:51:40,374 --> 00:51:41,940
That is so delicious.

1225
00:51:42,540 --> 00:51:44,707
(She's busy taking pictures)

1226
00:51:44,707 --> 00:51:46,107
This is really tasty.

1227
00:51:46,107 --> 00:51:47,907
I usually don't like coconuts.

1228
00:51:49,207 --> 00:51:51,774
(Let me try it as well)

1229
00:51:52,607 --> 00:51:54,707
- It's so refreshing. / - It's good, isn't it?

1230
00:51:55,207 --> 00:51:59,207
It could be a little too milky and sticky,

1231
00:51:59,207 --> 00:52:01,940
but this one is refreshing and clear.

1232
00:52:02,007 --> 00:52:04,040
It's like a natural sports drink.

1233
00:52:04,107 --> 00:52:05,974
I've never had coconut juice like this before.

1234
00:52:06,507 --> 00:52:08,240
(Screaming)

1235
00:52:08,974 --> 00:52:10,840
(The pork dish many people were eating is served)

1236
00:52:10,840 --> 00:52:12,740
I need to take a picture of this.

1237
00:52:13,040 --> 00:52:15,707
- This can't be pork. / - She's excited.

1238
00:52:16,074 --> 00:52:17,474
I'm suddenly hungry.

1239
00:52:17,474 --> 00:52:19,440
- There is a bone as well. / - It's pork rib.

1240
00:52:19,474 --> 00:52:20,707
Let's try it.

1241
00:52:21,107 --> 00:52:22,674
That!

1242
00:52:22,674 --> 00:52:25,874
- It was delicious. / - That's the stuff.

1243
00:52:26,107 --> 00:52:28,107
It's deep-fried pork belly.

1244
00:52:28,474 --> 00:52:30,340
Everything is delicious once it's deep-fried.

1245
00:52:30,340 --> 00:52:32,307
What was interesting was that it was very tender...

1246
00:52:32,307 --> 00:52:33,707
- On the inside. / - It has a bone on it.

1247
00:52:33,707 --> 00:52:35,674
It was really tender on the inside.

1248
00:52:35,907 --> 00:52:37,407
- It looks delicious. / - It's crispy on the outside.

1249
00:52:39,207 --> 00:52:42,007
- We can just gnaw it like that? / - It's so delicious.

1250
00:52:42,007 --> 00:52:43,574
Okay, let's just gnaw it.

1251
00:52:45,574 --> 00:52:46,674
It looks delicious.

1252
00:52:46,674 --> 00:52:49,240
- It looks so soft. / - It was really soft.

1253
00:52:49,240 --> 00:52:50,874
It's crispy on the outside and soft on the inside?

1254
00:52:50,874 --> 00:52:52,774
Yes, it was so moist and soft.

1255
00:52:53,207 --> 00:52:55,607
- It must be very delicious. / - We even forgot...

1256
00:52:55,607 --> 00:52:57,407
To put the sauce on it because it was so good.

1257
00:52:57,407 --> 00:53:00,007
It was like smoked pork belly.

1258
00:53:00,774 --> 00:53:03,974
I have never grabbed pork and eaten it like this.

1259
00:53:05,407 --> 00:53:07,107
Let's try yum woon sen as well.

1260
00:53:12,340 --> 00:53:13,440
Let's try it.

1261
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:16,374
We forgot to order this yesterday.

1262
00:53:16,374 --> 00:53:17,607
Let's try it today.

1263
00:53:20,774 --> 00:53:22,774
How is it? Let me try it as well.

1264
00:53:22,774 --> 00:53:23,840
Okay.

1265
00:53:24,707 --> 00:53:27,540
(She tastes it)

1266
00:53:29,740 --> 00:53:32,674
The smell of cilantro is not bad.

1267
00:53:33,140 --> 00:53:34,874
It smells rather refreshing.

1268
00:53:34,874 --> 00:53:37,274
I think I get now why people say cilantro is refreshing.

1269
00:53:37,874 --> 00:53:40,540
People who like cilantro say it tastes refreshing.

1270
00:53:40,807 --> 00:53:42,274
I think I know what that means.

1271
00:53:42,474 --> 00:53:44,040
It cleanses your palate.

1272
00:53:46,107 --> 00:53:48,474
Their food is very sweet, salty and sour.

1273
00:53:48,474 --> 00:53:49,774
It has strong flavors so cilantro

1274
00:53:49,774 --> 00:53:51,240
adds a refreshing taste.

1275
00:53:51,707 --> 00:53:54,407
If you add cilantro to a bland dish,

1276
00:53:54,407 --> 00:53:56,107
it smells very strong.

1277
00:53:56,107 --> 00:53:57,740
But it goes well with Thai food.

1278
00:53:57,740 --> 00:53:59,207
(Trying new food is a joy of traveling)

1279
00:54:01,007 --> 00:54:03,640
(They enjoy their meal)

1280
00:54:03,640 --> 00:54:07,240
At that point, I couldn't taste cilantro in the food.

1281
00:54:07,240 --> 00:54:09,107
- It was so good. / - It was so delicious.

1282
00:54:10,540 --> 00:54:12,040
Where are we going next?

1283
00:54:12,540 --> 00:54:13,940
I'm looking forward to it.

1284
00:54:13,940 --> 00:54:15,374
It has been only getting better.

1285
00:54:15,907 --> 00:54:18,374
We're going to a night market where you can

1286
00:54:18,374 --> 00:54:19,174
feel traditional Thailand.

1287
00:54:19,174 --> 00:54:21,274
- Let's go. / - Let's go.

1288
00:54:22,340 --> 00:54:24,674
(A night market in Pak Chong, Khao Yai)

1289
00:54:24,674 --> 00:54:25,740
Pak Chong.

1290
00:54:26,740 --> 00:54:28,274
The night market looks fun.

1291
00:54:28,274 --> 00:54:29,607
Isn't that 10 cents?

1292
00:54:29,607 --> 00:54:31,307
- Yes, it's 10 cents. / - So much good food.

1293
00:54:33,107 --> 00:54:35,707
They have various different kinds of market food.

1294
00:54:35,707 --> 00:54:37,740
They have so many kinds of food.

1295
00:54:38,274 --> 00:54:40,840
- They have fruits. / - The food seems familiar.

1296
00:54:40,874 --> 00:54:42,407
Right. It's Southeast Asian food.

1297
00:54:42,407 --> 00:54:45,007
- There's even dried squid. / - I can't choose.

1298
00:54:45,007 --> 00:54:46,640
It's hard to pick what to eat.

1299
00:54:46,640 --> 00:54:47,707
- We felt the same. / - Right?

1300
00:54:47,707 --> 00:54:49,174
That's why you have to try everything.

1301
00:54:49,507 --> 00:54:50,774
- I don't know which is which. / - So much.

1302
00:54:50,774 --> 00:54:52,040
There are waffles as well.

1303
00:54:57,707 --> 00:55:00,907
(Let's start the night market of An Park Tour)

1304
00:55:00,907 --> 00:55:02,240
What is this? It's juice.

1305
00:55:03,107 --> 00:55:04,240
That looks good.

1306
00:55:04,540 --> 00:55:05,607
What is that?

1307
00:55:05,907 --> 00:55:07,007
What is this?

1308
00:55:07,007 --> 00:55:08,507
(She's asking them in Korean)

1309
00:55:08,507 --> 00:55:09,740
"What is this?"

1310
00:55:10,107 --> 00:55:11,440
- She's speaking Korean. / - That's amazing.

1311
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:12,907
(Will they be able to understand Korean in Thailand?)

1312
00:55:12,907 --> 00:55:14,840
- Did you just ask a local? / - "What is this?"

1313
00:55:15,807 --> 00:55:16,840
"Is this good?"

1314
00:55:17,374 --> 00:55:19,907
We're at the night market in Thailand.

1315
00:55:20,107 --> 00:55:21,707
We found a really nice place.

1316
00:55:21,740 --> 00:55:22,840
- Yes. / - They have really nice desserts.

1317
00:55:22,840 --> 00:55:23,840
It's delicious.

1318
00:55:24,007 --> 00:55:25,540
- The juices are $1. / - Is it $1 per drink?

1319
00:55:25,540 --> 00:55:27,540
- Yes. / - It's really cheap.

1320
00:55:27,907 --> 00:55:29,074
It's really sweet.

1321
00:55:29,074 --> 00:55:31,207
The strawberries are kind of sweet.

1322
00:55:31,307 --> 00:55:33,574
I like this one.

1323
00:55:33,574 --> 00:55:35,307
Let me eat this in our hotel.

1324
00:55:35,307 --> 00:55:36,440
Okay, buy this.

1325
00:55:36,440 --> 00:55:38,140
Thank you. You're amazing.

1326
00:55:38,540 --> 00:55:40,040
She says to buy everything if it looks good.

1327
00:55:40,640 --> 00:55:43,474
(Mangosteen, also known as the queen of fruit)

1328
00:55:43,474 --> 00:55:46,007
- Mangosteen. / - I really like it.

1329
00:55:46,007 --> 00:55:47,607
It's pronounced "lychee" over there.

1330
00:55:47,607 --> 00:55:48,840
(1kg of mangosteen, about $1.70)

1331
00:55:49,474 --> 00:55:51,307
The good ones might be hidden.

1332
00:55:51,374 --> 00:55:52,640
What is this?

1333
00:55:53,474 --> 00:55:55,407
Is this potato grape?

1334
00:55:55,674 --> 00:55:56,874
It's langsat.

1335
00:55:57,607 --> 00:55:59,607
- That's really delicious. / - What is that?

1336
00:55:59,607 --> 00:56:01,307
- I was really surprised. / - That's really delicious.

1337
00:56:01,307 --> 00:56:02,707
- I was really surprised. / - It's dessert, right?

1338
00:56:02,707 --> 00:56:05,074
- It's similar to lychees. / - Yes, that's right.

1339
00:56:05,074 --> 00:56:07,274
(The insides are similar to lychees)

1340
00:56:10,307 --> 00:56:11,407
It's delicious.

1341
00:56:12,474 --> 00:56:15,174
I eat 30 of those at once when I go overseas.

1342
00:56:15,174 --> 00:56:16,907
- It's so delicious. / - Really?

1343
00:56:16,907 --> 00:56:17,974
It was so delicious.

1344
00:56:18,574 --> 00:56:20,807
We bought 2 bags of fruit with only $3.

1345
00:56:20,807 --> 00:56:21,940
(I'm so happy)

1346
00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:23,707
Are these...

1347
00:56:23,774 --> 00:56:27,040
The bananas that they roast in Africa?

1348
00:56:28,107 --> 00:56:29,874
I really want to try it but I'm so full. What should I do?

1349
00:56:29,874 --> 00:56:31,207
- I'm really full. / - Yes.

1350
00:56:33,607 --> 00:56:35,774
(You can't resist the temptation of the night market)

1351
00:56:35,774 --> 00:56:38,807
It tastes like waffles with maple syrup.

1352
00:56:38,807 --> 00:56:39,907
(Roasted banana, about 20 cents each)

1353
00:56:40,174 --> 00:56:42,740
(The night market is big with lots to eat)

1354
00:56:42,740 --> 00:56:45,474
(Endless eating show)

1355
00:56:45,474 --> 00:56:47,107
(It looks appetizing)

1356
00:56:47,107 --> 00:56:48,774
That looks delicious.

1357
00:56:49,207 --> 00:56:50,874
The pork ribs were really good.

1358
00:56:54,707 --> 00:56:58,074
This is paradise.

1359
00:56:58,140 --> 00:56:59,874
- There is so much to eat. / - Isn't that right?

1360
00:57:00,174 --> 00:57:01,540
They all look delicious.

1361
00:57:02,707 --> 00:57:03,840
What is this?

1362
00:57:04,707 --> 00:57:06,674
I can't eat durian.

1363
00:57:06,674 --> 00:57:09,040
You can't just walk past all that good food.

1364
00:57:09,040 --> 00:57:10,707
- They're durians. / - Durians aren't easy to eat.

1365
00:57:10,840 --> 00:57:13,040
You have to try the king of fruits.

1366
00:57:13,040 --> 00:57:14,307
I've never tried it before.

1367
00:57:14,307 --> 00:57:16,807
(Durians have appeared in the Singapore tour before)

1368
00:57:16,807 --> 00:57:17,940
The first taste is okay.

1369
00:57:17,940 --> 00:57:20,240
(You either like or hate it because of the smell)

1370
00:57:20,607 --> 00:57:23,940
It's also my first time but they say it's delicious.

1371
00:57:23,940 --> 00:57:26,740
How delicious is it?

1372
00:57:26,874 --> 00:57:29,474
- I've never had durian before. / - Me neither.

1373
00:57:29,540 --> 00:57:32,074
- I'm worried about the smell. / - Me too.

1374
00:57:32,207 --> 00:57:33,240
How do you eat it?

1375
00:57:35,374 --> 00:57:38,207
(The owner peels it for them to eat)

1376
00:57:39,007 --> 00:57:41,907
(They naturally take the durian to their nose)

1377
00:57:41,907 --> 00:57:43,040
It smells.

1378
00:57:43,807 --> 00:57:46,074
I can't eat durian because of the smell.

1379
00:57:46,607 --> 00:57:48,074
What does it smell like?

1380
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:52,007
- I can't explain it in words. / - Really?

1381
00:57:52,007 --> 00:57:53,840
You can't take durian with you

1382
00:57:53,840 --> 00:57:56,107
to your hotels in a lot of Southeast Asian countries.

1383
00:57:56,440 --> 00:57:58,240
- You must keep that in mind. / - Is it that bad?

1384
00:57:58,240 --> 00:57:59,740
Will Mina try it?

1385
00:57:59,940 --> 00:58:03,540
(Mina takes the durian straight to her mouth)

1386
00:58:04,740 --> 00:58:06,840
- Is it okay? / - It was delicious for me.

1387
00:58:06,840 --> 00:58:09,140
(She has an experimental mind that doesn't hesitate)

1388
00:58:09,874 --> 00:58:12,940
Do you know the most tender part of melons?

1389
00:58:13,540 --> 00:58:15,307
It's like eating that part.

1390
00:58:15,840 --> 00:58:17,007
Really?

1391
00:58:17,007 --> 00:58:18,740
(She tries it again after plucking up her courage)

1392
00:58:20,040 --> 00:58:21,807
(How is it?)

1393
00:58:25,907 --> 00:58:28,040
(This taste is?)

1394
00:58:28,040 --> 00:58:29,074
Is it good?

1395
00:58:29,774 --> 00:58:31,874
- You should cover your nose. / - She's surprised.

1396
00:58:31,874 --> 00:58:32,974
I was really surprised.

1397
00:58:32,974 --> 00:58:35,474
(She takes another bite to check again)

1398
00:58:35,474 --> 00:58:37,374
- It's like ice cream. / - I'm surprised.

1399
00:58:37,374 --> 00:58:39,340
It's like really soft cream.

1400
00:58:39,574 --> 00:58:41,607
- What is this? / - It tastes like whipped cream.

1401
00:58:42,407 --> 00:58:44,540
The end taste is fresh.

1402
00:58:44,974 --> 00:58:46,474
I know why people eat these now.

1403
00:58:46,740 --> 00:58:48,774
- It's not unpleasant. It's fresh. / - That's right.

1404
00:58:48,774 --> 00:58:50,340
(They got to know a new taste on their Thailand trip)

1405
00:58:50,374 --> 00:58:51,707
This is really delicious.

1406
00:58:51,707 --> 00:58:53,840
I'm so surprised.

1407
00:58:54,907 --> 00:58:57,540
- I had a culture shock. / - She also bought durians.

1408
00:58:57,540 --> 00:59:01,207
- I regretted not eating durians. / - Did you buy them?

1409
00:59:07,874 --> 00:59:16,340
(The last moment of the trip is sadly here)

1410
00:59:18,640 --> 00:59:21,240
(They have a cocktail party to cheer themselves)

1411
00:59:27,674 --> 00:59:30,940
(Salmon salad, about $12)

1412
00:59:42,007 --> 00:59:45,140
- Cheers. / - Cheers.

1413
00:59:47,574 --> 00:59:49,040
This is delicious.

1414
00:59:51,140 --> 00:59:53,374
It's sad to think that this is the last night of our trip.

1415
00:59:53,374 --> 00:59:56,740
You always wish that you had one more day.

1416
00:59:56,740 --> 00:59:57,807
- That's right. / - Yes.

1417
00:59:57,807 --> 01:00:00,074
Where do you want to go if you had one more day?

1418
01:00:01,740 --> 01:00:03,907
I want to go to the waterfall.

1419
01:00:04,974 --> 01:00:06,907
It looks like the Amazon, right?

1420
01:00:06,907 --> 01:00:09,674
- I was scared. I was shaking. / - Yes, of course.

1421
01:00:11,007 --> 01:00:12,474
The moment we went down,

1422
01:00:12,474 --> 01:00:15,007
the waterfall before our eyes was...

1423
01:00:15,107 --> 01:00:16,674
So amazing.

1424
01:00:16,840 --> 01:00:18,574
They went to a lot of places.

1425
01:00:18,640 --> 01:00:19,974
The waterfall was nice.

1426
01:00:21,074 --> 01:00:22,674
It was so amazing.

1427
01:00:22,874 --> 01:00:24,274
When people say that there is a jungle

1428
01:00:24,274 --> 01:00:25,874
and a winery...

1429
01:00:25,874 --> 01:00:29,840
It felt like experiencing opposite extremes.

1430
01:00:29,840 --> 01:00:32,240
There are so many things to enjoy,

1431
01:00:32,240 --> 01:00:34,074
see and eat.

1432
01:00:34,074 --> 01:00:35,407
There are so many things.

1433
01:00:36,474 --> 01:00:39,474
We came to Thailand for this trip but it feels...

1434
01:00:39,474 --> 01:00:41,807
- We've been to five countries. / - You're right.

1435
01:00:41,807 --> 01:00:44,740
Thailand and the Philippines,

1436
01:00:44,740 --> 01:00:47,874
France, Italy and a mysterious jungle.

1437
01:00:47,874 --> 01:00:49,840
- That's right. / - It felt like that.

1438
01:00:50,507 --> 01:00:53,374
There were so many things I tried for the first time.

1439
01:00:53,374 --> 01:00:56,207
I think I could enjoy all the places again.

1440
01:00:56,207 --> 01:00:57,574
(A heart-warming trip with lots of first experiences)

1441
01:00:58,140 --> 01:01:00,074
An Park Tour!

1442
01:01:00,074 --> 01:01:04,074
(An Park Tour in Khao Yai, Thailand, the end)

1443
01:01:05,074 --> 01:01:06,607
Thailand also has...

1444
01:01:06,607 --> 01:01:08,374
- Various charms. / - Of course.

1445
01:01:08,374 --> 01:01:10,940
JR, what impressed you the most in Khao Yai?

1446
01:01:10,940 --> 01:01:15,274
The food was the most impressive for me.

1447
01:01:15,440 --> 01:01:17,740
It was really interesting to see elephants

1448
01:01:17,740 --> 01:01:19,074
just wandering around.

1449
01:01:19,474 --> 01:01:21,207
With a friend...

1450
01:01:21,407 --> 01:01:23,107
Just taking a walk that path quietly

1451
01:01:23,107 --> 01:01:25,440
and sit in that elephant observatory

1452
01:01:25,440 --> 01:01:28,840
without saying a word was very relaxing.

1453
01:01:28,840 --> 01:01:31,807
All the bird noises over there...

1454
01:01:31,807 --> 01:01:33,774
It really cleared my head.

1455
01:01:33,840 --> 01:01:36,840
It's a nice place to relax.

1456
01:01:37,574 --> 01:01:40,140
- Okay, let's see the expenses. / - The expenses.

1457
01:01:40,140 --> 01:01:42,674
Last week, Song Vacation slept in a pool villa.

1458
01:01:42,674 --> 01:01:44,907
So they spent $488.

1459
01:01:44,907 --> 01:01:47,440
Will the total expense influence the final decision?

1460
01:01:47,440 --> 01:01:48,707
Let's see how much they used.

1461
01:01:48,707 --> 01:01:50,507
For 2 nights and 3 days,

1462
01:01:50,507 --> 01:01:53,140
the total expense of the An Park Tour...

1463
01:01:53,140 --> 01:01:54,107
The total expense is?

1464
01:01:54,107 --> 01:01:55,707
- For one person is... / - For one person.

1465
01:01:55,907 --> 01:01:57,474
$209.

1466
01:01:57,740 --> 01:01:59,440
Wow. It's really cheap.

1467
01:02:02,140 --> 01:02:03,907
- Isn't it really cheap? / - It's really cheap.

1468
01:02:03,907 --> 01:02:05,974
- It was half the price of Vietnam. / - Yes.

1469
01:02:05,974 --> 01:02:07,674
$209.

1470
01:02:07,674 --> 01:02:09,274
You slept in a too luxurious place.

1471
01:02:09,274 --> 01:02:10,707
But we went to the safari for free

1472
01:02:10,707 --> 01:02:12,740
because we slept there.

1473
01:02:13,074 --> 01:02:14,407
Was the safari free because you slept there?

1474
01:02:14,407 --> 01:02:16,507
It costs $50 per person to go to that safari either wise.

1475
01:02:16,507 --> 01:02:18,774
But two people can travel to Khao Yai...

1476
01:02:18,774 --> 01:02:21,007
For the price of one person going to Phu Quoc.

1477
01:02:21,640 --> 01:02:23,407
- That's nice. / - Even 10 people...

1478
01:02:23,407 --> 01:02:24,874
Could sleep in that room.

1479
01:02:24,874 --> 01:02:26,240
Okay.

1480
01:02:26,240 --> 01:02:28,174
Let's vote.

1481
01:02:28,174 --> 01:02:31,907
Would you like to go to Khao Yai, Thailand according

1482
01:02:31,907 --> 01:02:34,674
to the design of the An Park Tour?

1483
01:02:34,674 --> 01:02:36,340
Please vote.

1484
01:02:37,640 --> 01:02:41,874
(An Park Tour planned a trip to Khao Yai, Thailand)

1485
01:02:41,874 --> 01:02:45,974
(What will the judges choose?)

1486
01:02:46,140 --> 01:02:49,107
They say it's a neck-and-neck match.

1487
01:02:49,274 --> 01:02:53,674
Will it be Song Vacation to Phu Quoc, Vietnam?

1488
01:02:53,674 --> 01:02:56,807
Or will it be An Park Tour to Khao Yai, Thailand?

1489
01:02:56,807 --> 01:02:58,774
- I'm so nervous. / - What will it be?

1490
01:02:59,107 --> 01:03:02,007
What will the judges choose?

1491
01:03:02,007 --> 01:03:02,940
Since it's neck-and-neck,

1492
01:03:02,940 --> 01:03:03,840
the front digit will be the same.

1493
01:03:03,840 --> 01:03:06,140
- The front digit might be the same. / - It changes a lot.

1494
01:03:06,140 --> 01:03:08,174
I think it will be an 8.

1495
01:03:08,174 --> 01:03:09,574
- 8 for both front digits? / - Yes.

1496
01:03:09,574 --> 01:03:11,907
- I don't know. / - It was worth a 9.

1497
01:03:11,907 --> 01:03:13,574
- I'd say 92 or 93? / - No, no.

1498
01:03:13,574 --> 01:03:14,974
- It's an 8. / - An Park Tour.

1499
01:03:14,974 --> 01:03:17,674
Song Vacation.

1500
01:03:18,907 --> 01:03:20,440
- 1 and 7. / - What's going on?

1501
01:03:20,440 --> 01:03:22,407
How did this happen?

1502
01:03:22,407 --> 01:03:24,174
- 87? / - We've won.

1503
01:03:24,174 --> 01:03:25,240
- What is it? / - We must have won.

1504
01:03:25,240 --> 01:03:26,840
- What is the first digit? / - What should I do?

1505
01:03:26,840 --> 01:03:28,007
- No? / - Oh my...

1506
01:03:29,140 --> 01:03:34,307
- No? / - Oh my...

(Phu Quoc won with 81 votes)

1508
01:03:39,607 --> 01:03:41,407
It was a 4-vote difference.

1509
01:03:41,407 --> 01:03:43,074
(Khao Yai with 77 votes vs. Phu Quoc with 81 votes)

1510
01:03:43,074 --> 01:03:45,840
- It was pretty close. / - Let's hear their thoughts.

1511
01:03:45,840 --> 01:03:48,107
It feels great. Actually,

1512
01:03:48,107 --> 01:03:50,440
we introduced Phu Quoc

1513
01:03:50,440 --> 01:03:53,040
because we wanted a lot of people to experience it.

1514
01:03:53,040 --> 01:03:54,907
We really enjoyed it.

1515
01:03:54,907 --> 01:03:57,140
You won't regret

1516
01:03:57,140 --> 01:03:58,807
if you go exactly according to our trip.

1517
01:03:58,807 --> 01:04:00,040
- You'll go there again, right? / - Yes.

1518
01:04:00,040 --> 01:04:02,040
- You're going next week, right? / - Next week.

1519
01:04:02,040 --> 01:04:03,174
Okay, JR.

1520
01:04:03,174 --> 01:04:05,740
How were the last 2 weeks with us? Did you enjoy it?

1521
01:04:05,740 --> 01:04:09,107
I got to learn a lot of good information.

1522
01:04:09,107 --> 01:04:10,207
That was nice.

1523
01:04:10,207 --> 01:04:12,040
I realized that the most important thing during a trip

1524
01:04:12,040 --> 01:04:16,274
is that you have to be satisfied.

1525
01:04:16,274 --> 01:04:18,974
I thought it would be nice if people can go

1526
01:04:18,974 --> 01:04:21,807
where they can be satisfied.

1527
01:04:21,807 --> 01:04:26,040
A preview for next week is that it's our 100th episode.

1528
01:04:27,207 --> 01:04:30,440
- That's amazing. / - Please look forward to it.

1529
01:04:30,707 --> 01:04:32,874
- Is it the 100th episode already? / - It'll be a special.

1530
01:04:32,874 --> 01:04:34,774
Please look forward to our 100th episode special.

1531
01:04:34,774 --> 01:04:36,274
We will say good-bye to you here.

1532
01:04:36,274 --> 01:04:37,974
The world is your school. Life is a journey.

1533
01:04:37,974 --> 01:04:41,040

01:04:45,640 --> 01:04:48,140
I'm going to save everything in my eyes.

1536
01:04:49,374 --> 01:04:51,207
I might end up living in Canada.

1537
01:04:51,407 --> 01:04:53,574
It's Niagara Falls!

1538
01:04:55,707 --> 01:04:58,040
This was all formed naturally!

1539
01:04:58,440 --> 01:05:00,074
- I want to live here. / - It's nice, right?

1540
01:05:00,074 --> 01:05:02,274
I want to live here, Seulgi.

1541
01:05:02,274 --> 01:05:03,274
I think I've seen it in a movie.

1542
01:05:03,274 --> 01:05:05,040
This is what Europe is all about.

1543
01:05:05,040 --> 01:05:06,774
Wow!

1544
01:05:06,774 --> 01:05:07,707
Hey!

1545
01:05:07,707 --> 01:05:10,140
