1
00:00:00,643 --> 00:00:03,710
(Numerous great tips on trips)

2
00:00:06,376 --> 00:00:07,376
(Lee Hwijae, special host, Eric Nam)

3
00:00:07,976 --> 00:00:09,043
(Kim Sook, Sung Sikyung)

4
00:00:10,943 --> 00:00:11,976
Travel is war.

5
00:00:11,976 --> 00:00:14,643
Battle Trip!

6
00:00:16,776 --> 00:00:20,176
The special host for today is Eric Nam.

7
00:00:20,176 --> 00:00:20,843
Nice to meet you.

8
00:00:23,476 --> 00:00:24,710
- Wow. / - You actually...

9
00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:26,110
Have this image of a traveler.

10
00:00:26,110 --> 00:00:28,010
It's because he's famous for those commercials.

11
00:00:28,010 --> 00:00:29,843
When you look at his name...

12
00:00:29,843 --> 00:00:33,110
It doesn't seem like he's from Korea.

13
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:34,076
Eric Nam?

14
00:00:34,076 --> 00:00:36,976
There are people who don't know where you're from.

15
00:00:36,976 --> 00:00:38,976
I'm from Atlanta, U.S.

16
00:00:39,876 --> 00:00:40,976
Were you born there?

17
00:00:40,976 --> 00:00:43,210
- Yes, I was. / - How long did you live there?

18
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:45,176
I lived there until I was 20.

19
00:00:45,176 --> 00:00:46,610
That means when you go to Atlanta,

20
00:00:46,610 --> 00:00:48,343
you know all the places to go there.

21
00:00:48,343 --> 00:00:49,843
- From the eateries... / - That's right.

22
00:00:49,843 --> 00:00:51,110
There are a few things

23
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:52,843
you must try when you go to Atlanta.

24
00:00:52,843 --> 00:00:54,410
It's in the southern part of U.S.

25
00:00:54,410 --> 00:00:55,610
so they have a lot of fried food.

26
00:00:55,610 --> 00:00:56,943
There's fried chicken.

27
00:00:56,943 --> 00:00:59,310
It's a little crispier than Korean fried chicken

28
00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:01,676
and you can taste a lot of pepper.

29
00:01:01,676 --> 00:01:02,343
So you must eat some chicken...

30
00:01:02,343 --> 00:01:04,710
And you know the soda brand.

31
00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:05,676
- The "C" company? / - Yes.

32
00:01:05,676 --> 00:01:08,310
- That company started in Atlanta. / - Atlanta?

33
00:01:09,076 --> 00:01:11,043
You can enjoy soda

34
00:01:11,043 --> 00:01:13,676
from all over the world there.

35
00:01:13,676 --> 00:01:14,476
That sounds exciting.

36
00:01:16,143 --> 00:01:17,943
You could think the other way around.

37
00:01:17,943 --> 00:01:19,710
Let's say your friends from Atlanta come here...

38
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:21,376
- You can plan the trip around Korea, right? / - Yeah.

39
00:01:21,376 --> 00:01:22,610
Where would you take them?

40
00:01:22,610 --> 00:01:25,710
First, people like Gwanghwamun a lot.

41
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:27,810
People from other countries like

42
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:30,010
to take photos there since it's so beautiful.

43
00:01:30,010 --> 00:01:31,243
They love Gyeongbokgung.

44
00:01:31,243 --> 00:01:32,976
Going there dressed in hanbok.

45
00:01:32,976 --> 00:01:34,276
They like those places.

46
00:01:34,276 --> 00:01:35,643
And I live in Hannam-dong

47
00:01:35,643 --> 00:01:38,843
so I take them to my hangouts to have drinks.

48
00:01:38,843 --> 00:01:41,443
We have Eric Nam here for a reason.

49
00:01:41,443 --> 00:01:43,876
We can trust him when it comes to traveling.

50
00:01:43,876 --> 00:01:46,176
It has something to do with today's theme.

51
00:01:46,176 --> 00:01:48,710
Special trip planners planned today's trip.

52
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:53,476
The trips were planned by locals.

53
00:01:53,476 --> 00:01:55,243
It's a local's travel plan special.

54
00:01:55,243 --> 00:01:57,376
So the people living in there

55
00:01:57,376 --> 00:01:59,176
plan the trip for visitors.

56
00:01:59,176 --> 00:02:00,243
It's game over.

57
00:02:00,843 --> 00:02:04,010
It's a course that experienced travelers really want.

58
00:02:04,010 --> 00:02:05,576
They don't want tourist sites.

59
00:02:05,576 --> 00:02:07,843
- Locals. / - Not where tourists go...

60
00:02:07,843 --> 00:02:09,243
- Only what the locals know. / - That's right.

61
00:02:09,243 --> 00:02:10,576
- The hidden eateries. / - That's right.

62
00:02:10,576 --> 00:02:12,276
Places where only locals eat.

63
00:02:12,276 --> 00:02:14,210
It looks more delicious.

64
00:02:14,210 --> 00:02:15,910
It feels like I've visited a special place.

65
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:17,243
It's fun pretending to be a local.

66
00:02:17,243 --> 00:02:18,743
That's right.

67
00:02:19,376 --> 00:02:22,010
We're looking forward to which locals

68
00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:22,943
planned these trips.

69
00:02:22,943 --> 00:02:25,943
The destinations for the battle today are

70
00:02:25,943 --> 00:02:27,876
Vietnam and the Philippines.

71
00:02:30,343 --> 00:02:32,076
Vietnam vs. the Philippines.

72
00:02:33,276 --> 00:02:35,743
I'm curious about who planned the tour.

73
00:02:35,743 --> 00:02:38,543
Is there anyone we know who lives in...

74
00:02:38,543 --> 00:02:39,610
- Vietnam and the Philippines? / - There is.

75
00:02:39,610 --> 00:02:41,176
- Is there? / - Currently, in Vietnam...

76
00:02:41,176 --> 00:02:42,810
The Hiddink of Vietnam lives there.

77
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:44,876
- Head Coach Park Hangseo. / - He's there.

78
00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:47,243
And also...

79
00:02:47,243 --> 00:02:48,610
There's a famous person living in the Philippines.

80
00:02:48,610 --> 00:02:49,243
Who?

81
00:02:49,243 --> 00:02:50,543
He's a legendary boxer.

82
00:02:50,543 --> 00:02:51,610
- Pacquiao? / - Pacquiao?

83
00:02:51,610 --> 00:02:52,410
Of course. We can't forget him.

84
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:54,910
- Will Pacquiao be on Battle Trip? / - He's here?

85
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:56,876
Will he plan a trip for Battle Trip?

86
00:02:56,876 --> 00:02:57,610
That's amazing.

87
00:02:57,610 --> 00:02:59,310
That'd be so fun.

88
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:01,376
I know that Lim Sungeun

89
00:03:01,376 --> 00:03:03,810
has lived in Boracay in the Philippines

90
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:04,876
for a long time.

91
00:03:04,876 --> 00:03:06,010
Or else, we need Sandara Park.

92
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:08,376
- Sandara Park... / - She needs to come.

93
00:03:08,376 --> 00:03:10,576
- Sandara... / - The Dara Tour was such a hit.

94
00:03:10,576 --> 00:03:11,443
- That's right. / - Right.

95
00:03:11,443 --> 00:03:13,076
Let's see their photos first.

96
00:03:13,076 --> 00:03:14,876
- The photos of the planners? / - Yes.

97
00:03:14,876 --> 00:03:16,876
These are the local trip planners

98
00:03:16,876 --> 00:03:18,776
who planned the trips for today.

99
00:03:18,776 --> 00:03:20,743
Let's meet them.

100
00:03:21,976 --> 00:03:24,276
The Philippines... Oh, him.

101
00:03:24,276 --> 00:03:26,076
- Ryan Bang. / - Recently...

102
00:03:26,076 --> 00:03:28,176
He's 100% a local.

103
00:03:28,176 --> 00:03:30,243
He's the Yu Jaeseok of the Philippines.

104
00:03:30,243 --> 00:03:31,710
- Ryan Bang. / - Ryan Bang.

105
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:32,876
- That's right. / - He's very famous.

106
00:03:32,876 --> 00:03:34,610
And on Sandara Park's

107
00:03:34,610 --> 00:03:36,043
Dara Tour...

108
00:03:36,043 --> 00:03:37,743
- Ryan Bang was in it. / - He visited.

109
00:03:37,743 --> 00:03:39,810
They had delicious food together.

110
00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:40,743
Everyone.

111
00:03:40,743 --> 00:03:45,043
This time, it's the local planner for Vietnam.

112
00:03:45,043 --> 00:03:46,043
- Who is it? / - Please show us.

113
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:50,310
It's Yeom Gyeonghwan.

114
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:51,743
- He lives there? / - It's Yeom Gyeonghwan.

115
00:03:51,743 --> 00:03:52,710
He immigrated there.

116
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:53,710
- Thing is... / - With his family.

117
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:55,776
But with Battle Trip,

118
00:03:55,776 --> 00:03:57,810
normally, you plan your own trip.

119
00:03:57,810 --> 00:04:00,376
- But since we have locals... / - It's convenient.

120
00:04:00,376 --> 00:04:01,610
You don't have to study about anything and...

121
00:04:01,610 --> 00:04:03,810
- Just go like a travel package. / - That's right.

122
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:04,476
That's the best.

123
00:04:04,476 --> 00:04:05,676
- That's so convenient. / - Right.

124
00:04:05,676 --> 00:04:08,176
We will meet the travelers

125
00:04:08,176 --> 00:04:10,176
who went on this tour.

126
00:04:10,176 --> 00:04:11,876
It will be very loud today.

127
00:04:11,876 --> 00:04:13,076
Today will be the loudest day.

128
00:04:13,076 --> 00:04:14,610
Come on out!

129
00:04:19,376 --> 00:04:21,110
(Choi Eunkyeong, Ahn Sunyeong)

130
00:04:25,043 --> 00:04:27,310
Why are you doing slapstick?

131
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:28,676
We'll do our entrance again.

132
00:04:28,676 --> 00:04:29,776
I'm sorry.

133
00:04:29,776 --> 00:04:31,410
Let me do a backflip as I enter.

134
00:04:32,076 --> 00:04:33,176
Actually, Eunkyeong...

135
00:04:33,176 --> 00:04:35,410
- I'm pretty close with Gyeonghwan. / - Yes.

136
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:36,810
Was the trip okay?

137
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:39,076
To tell you the truth, our reaction was also like this

138
00:04:39,076 --> 00:04:40,676
when we first knew that we were

139
00:04:40,676 --> 00:04:41,810
going on the Yeom Tour.

140
00:04:42,476 --> 00:04:44,310
We had no expectation.

141
00:04:45,176 --> 00:04:46,843
- So... / - Less than none.

142
00:04:46,843 --> 00:04:48,010
We were worried it'd be bad

143
00:04:48,010 --> 00:04:49,643
so we did all the research ourselves.

144
00:04:49,643 --> 00:04:52,076
We made a wish list from 1 to 10.

145
00:04:52,076 --> 00:04:53,543
Telling him what we wanted to do.

146
00:04:53,543 --> 00:04:54,343
However,

147
00:04:54,343 --> 00:04:56,010
we didn't miss out on a single thing.

148
00:04:56,010 --> 00:04:58,310
If I could go on the Yeom Tour one more time...

149
00:04:58,310 --> 00:05:00,010
- I would go again. / - Seriously? Gyeonghwan?

150
00:05:00,010 --> 00:05:01,143
I can't believe it.

151
00:05:01,143 --> 00:05:03,243
- We were also like this. / - That was our reaction.

152
00:05:03,243 --> 00:05:05,076
Because we had low expectations,

153
00:05:05,076 --> 00:05:06,610
the joy became multiplied.

154
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:07,810
It was amazing.

155
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:09,076
- This is good. / - It was amazing.

156
00:05:09,076 --> 00:05:11,310
Our team should talk about their trip too.

157
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:12,010
How was it?

158
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:14,110
For us, actually...

159
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:16,110
What do you think is the most important thing

160
00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:17,976
when you go on a trip?

161
00:05:17,976 --> 00:05:19,676
The food.

162
00:05:19,676 --> 00:05:20,143
Money.

163
00:05:20,143 --> 00:05:21,510
- This wasn't what I was expecting. / - Language.

164
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:22,743
- Are they all wrong? / - What was wrong?

165
00:05:22,743 --> 00:05:23,710
- Let's do it again. / - We'll do it again for you.

166
00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:24,410
- What is it? / - Go again.

167
00:05:24,410 --> 00:05:25,343
What's the answer?

168
00:05:25,343 --> 00:05:26,343
She says it's language.

169
00:05:27,576 --> 00:05:28,910
What is the most important thing

170
00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:30,276
when you go on a trip?

171
00:05:30,276 --> 00:05:31,576
- The food. / - The language.

172
00:05:31,576 --> 00:05:32,310
That is correct.

173
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:34,476
The language!

174
00:05:34,476 --> 00:05:35,743
It is language.

175
00:05:35,743 --> 00:05:37,510
I told you that it would be a little loud today.

176
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:38,576
Good job.

177
00:05:38,576 --> 00:05:40,276
- Good work. / - She's right.

178
00:05:40,276 --> 00:05:42,876
If you can't communicate, you feel like an outsider.

179
00:05:42,876 --> 00:05:44,276
But if you can communicate,

180
00:05:44,276 --> 00:05:45,410
they won't look down on you.

181
00:05:45,410 --> 00:05:47,143
- That's right. / - They will accept you.

182
00:05:47,143 --> 00:05:48,043
That's right.

183
00:05:48,043 --> 00:05:49,610
I wanted to tell you that.

184
00:05:49,610 --> 00:05:53,210
Ryan Bang is as popular as Yu Jaeseok

185
00:05:53,210 --> 00:05:53,543
over there...

186
00:05:53,543 --> 00:05:55,276
- He's so popular. / - Just say he's like Hwijae.

187
00:05:55,276 --> 00:05:55,976
Say Lee Hwijae instead.

188
00:05:55,976 --> 00:05:57,643
Oh, he's like Lee Hwijae...

189
00:05:57,643 --> 00:05:59,210
Oh, he's like Lee Hwijae...

190
00:05:59,210 --> 00:06:00,176
So...

191
00:06:00,176 --> 00:06:01,743
He's the Lee Hwijae of the Philippines.

192
00:06:01,743 --> 00:06:03,443
That's how we saw him.

193
00:06:03,443 --> 00:06:05,176
That's why there were no communication problems.

194
00:06:05,176 --> 00:06:07,576
We didn't feel uncomfortable at all during the trip.

195
00:06:07,576 --> 00:06:10,043
Gyeonghwan also did well at everything.

196
00:06:10,043 --> 00:06:11,676
First off... Everyone...

197
00:06:11,676 --> 00:06:13,476
It's Vietnam vs. the Philippines today.

198
00:06:13,476 --> 00:06:15,176
Let's see where they went.

199
00:06:15,176 --> 00:06:17,843
- We went to the capital of Vietnam. / - The capital.

200
00:06:17,843 --> 00:06:19,510
- It's the center of Vietnam. / - The center.

201
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:21,243
It has a history of 1,000 years.

202
00:06:21,243 --> 00:06:22,276
Vietnam's....

203
00:06:22,276 --> 00:06:24,276
You go to Hanoi!

204
00:06:24,276 --> 00:06:26,143
You go to Hanoi!

205
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:29,210
They planned it.

206
00:06:29,743 --> 00:06:30,976
- Why? / - Wait a minute.

207
00:06:30,976 --> 00:06:32,010
- Why? / - They planned it.

208
00:06:32,010 --> 00:06:33,276
So what? We practiced it.

209
00:06:33,276 --> 00:06:34,476
- We prepared it. What's wrong? / - No...

210
00:06:34,476 --> 00:06:35,376
- I really liked it. / - We...

211
00:06:35,376 --> 00:06:36,276
It's our style.

212
00:06:36,276 --> 00:06:36,976
Okay.

213
00:06:36,976 --> 00:06:38,376
Hanoi is too...

214
00:06:38,376 --> 00:06:39,510
Hanoi is too common.

215
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:41,176
- People have already been there. / - Too much.

216
00:06:41,176 --> 00:06:42,843
- It's possible to think so. / - Actually, we know...

217
00:06:42,843 --> 00:06:44,243
When it comes to Hanoi,

218
00:06:44,243 --> 00:06:46,276
it holds the record for the highest by-minute rating.

219
00:06:46,276 --> 00:06:47,943
- With Ok Taecyeon... / - The snakehead.

220
00:06:47,943 --> 00:06:50,143
- The snakehead noodles. / - That's right.

221
00:06:50,143 --> 00:06:54,343
We didn't eat snakehead noodles.

222
00:06:54,343 --> 00:06:56,143
You had to try that.

223
00:06:56,143 --> 00:06:57,443
You have to eat noodles.

224
00:06:57,443 --> 00:06:58,876
There are certain things you expect with Hanoi

225
00:06:58,876 --> 00:07:00,976
like eating Vietnamese rice noodles and so forth...

226
00:07:00,976 --> 00:07:01,976
You didn't eat rice noodles?

227
00:07:01,976 --> 00:07:04,910
- We did not eat rice noodles. / - Not even once.

228
00:07:04,910 --> 00:07:05,843
That's the same as...

229
00:07:05,843 --> 00:07:08,210
foreigners not eating bulgogi in Korea.

230
00:07:08,210 --> 00:07:10,643
They sell bulgogi overseas.

231
00:07:10,643 --> 00:07:13,143
- Korea has a lot of rice noodles. / - Lots of good places.

232
00:07:13,143 --> 00:07:15,443
We didn't eat rice noodles.

233
00:07:15,443 --> 00:07:18,343
"In Hanoi?" "This food exists in Vietnam?"

234
00:07:18,343 --> 00:07:20,443
- We ate everything that makes you say that. / - Really.

235
00:07:20,443 --> 00:07:22,410
I get what you're talking about.

236
00:07:22,410 --> 00:07:23,276
The real...

237
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:25,643
"You must go and eat this."

238
00:07:25,643 --> 00:07:27,776
- You'll see a list of such foods. / - Everyone...

239
00:07:27,776 --> 00:07:29,476
Grab a pen and write it all down.

240
00:07:29,476 --> 00:07:31,043
I'm so intimidated.

241
00:07:31,043 --> 00:07:32,876
You're both former shopping network hosts

242
00:07:32,876 --> 00:07:34,076
so you speak really well.

243
00:07:34,943 --> 00:07:36,276
I feel confident already.

244
00:07:36,276 --> 00:07:37,143
I don't need to do anything.

245
00:07:37,143 --> 00:07:38,210
- I almost ordered it. / - Everyone...

246
00:07:38,210 --> 00:07:39,710
You will end up ordering Hanoi.

247
00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:40,276
Because...

248
00:07:40,276 --> 00:07:41,476
The thing is...

249
00:07:41,476 --> 00:07:43,110
We can't lose.

250
00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:44,376
Please introduce your trip.

251
00:07:44,376 --> 00:07:47,076
The island with white beaches and a fantastic sunset.

252
00:07:47,076 --> 00:07:48,910
The island that gets more glamorous

253
00:07:48,910 --> 00:07:50,310
in the night when the stars come out.

254
00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:51,176
Let's shout it out together.

255
00:07:51,176 --> 00:07:55,076
??Cay, cay, it's Boracay ??

256
00:07:56,010 --> 00:07:56,810
They planned it too.

257
00:07:58,576 --> 00:08:01,043
People are very interested

258
00:08:01,043 --> 00:08:02,043
in Boracay these days.

259
00:08:02,043 --> 00:08:03,143
There are lots of articles about it too.

260
00:08:03,143 --> 00:08:05,376
- There are environmental issues. / - Isn't there a problem?

261
00:08:05,376 --> 00:08:06,576
- Is it okay? / - Because of the environment...

262
00:08:06,576 --> 00:08:09,010
They're planning to close the island for a while

263
00:08:09,010 --> 00:08:11,143
but it hasn't been decided yet.

264
00:08:12,043 --> 00:08:14,243
We'll give you information on that today.

265
00:08:14,243 --> 00:08:16,710
We'll tell you what it's actually like there.

266
00:08:16,710 --> 00:08:18,810
I've been to Boracay and

267
00:08:18,810 --> 00:08:20,010
I'm sure that a lot of people have.

268
00:08:20,010 --> 00:08:22,843
- Boracay... / - If you took the usual course...

269
00:08:22,843 --> 00:08:24,776
- People might get disappointed. / - Right.

270
00:08:24,776 --> 00:08:26,510
Do you have anything special?

271
00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:27,543
It's not the common course at all.

272
00:08:27,543 --> 00:08:29,043
We were shocked because...

273
00:08:29,043 --> 00:08:31,310
We thought it was the obvious course too.

274
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:34,710
But the plan that Ryan made was really new.

275
00:08:34,710 --> 00:08:36,243
We saw the land, sea

276
00:08:36,243 --> 00:08:37,710
and sky of Boracay.

277
00:08:37,710 --> 00:08:39,310
Our trip includes everything.

278
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:40,776
Once you watch, you'll sing this song...

279
00:08:40,776 --> 00:08:44,476
??Cay cay, Boracay ??

280
00:08:44,476 --> 00:08:46,743
They're supposed to be singers. Why are they so off?

281
00:08:46,743 --> 00:08:48,710
- Why is their harmony so off key. / - I'm sorry but...

282
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:49,543
Anyway.

283
00:08:49,543 --> 00:08:50,576
Today's Battle Trip

284
00:08:50,576 --> 00:08:53,143
is Hanoi, Vietnam vs. Boracay, the Philippines.

285
00:08:53,143 --> 00:08:57,043
Let's see how the trip planned by locals are.

286
00:08:57,043 --> 00:08:57,976
We have high expectations.

287
00:08:57,976 --> 00:09:00,143
We have our 100 impartial judges

288
00:09:00,143 --> 00:09:02,776
who will vote on today's trips.

289
00:09:02,776 --> 00:09:04,076
- Nice to meet you. / - Welcome.

290
00:09:06,410 --> 00:09:07,676
Wait a minute.

291
00:09:08,376 --> 00:09:10,176
Wait a minute.

292
00:09:10,176 --> 00:09:11,643
It's his fault.

293
00:09:11,643 --> 00:09:13,476
I did it without realizing.

294
00:09:13,476 --> 00:09:16,010
There is no vote after the first half today.

295
00:09:16,010 --> 00:09:17,843
Normally, we have the vote halfway

296
00:09:17,843 --> 00:09:19,510
that doesn't determine the winner.

297
00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:21,610
But today, we'll just do one final vote for each trip.

298
00:09:22,576 --> 00:09:23,943
It will be a single round match.

299
00:09:23,943 --> 00:09:24,710
- You're right. / - Right.

300
00:09:25,710 --> 00:09:27,010
We will reveal

301
00:09:27,010 --> 00:09:29,376
the Yeom Tour in Hanoi first.

302
00:09:29,376 --> 00:09:31,076
Let's start the Hanoi trip.

303
00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:39,110
Hanoi.

304
00:09:40,476 --> 00:09:42,076
- It's like art. / - Did you go there?

305
00:09:43,076 --> 00:09:45,410
- Those mountains were like art. / - Did you go there?

306
00:09:45,410 --> 00:09:47,210
- That's all the places we went. / - Really?

307
00:09:47,510 --> 00:09:49,610
(Vietnam is affordable and safe)

308
00:09:49,610 --> 00:09:52,210
(Danang scored 99 votes last time)

309
00:09:52,210 --> 00:09:54,843
(Hanoi had the highest recorded rating at 11%)

310
00:09:55,210 --> 00:09:57,643
(Battle Trip went to Vietnam 4 times already)

311
00:09:57,643 --> 00:09:58,910
Many people have been already.

312
00:10:00,676 --> 00:10:02,510
You can expect even more than that.

313
00:10:04,476 --> 00:10:06,910
The view is amazing here.

314
00:10:08,610 --> 00:10:09,643
What is that?

315
00:10:09,643 --> 00:10:10,476
I've never been there.

316
00:10:10,476 --> 00:10:11,743
I really want to go.

317
00:10:12,676 --> 00:10:13,676
It's so nice.

318
00:10:13,676 --> 00:10:15,976
(The secret Hanoi that people are dreaming about)

319
00:10:16,310 --> 00:10:16,976
So good.

320
00:10:16,976 --> 00:10:19,543
I thought it'd be to your liking.

321
00:10:19,543 --> 00:10:21,510
- You have to give up on diet here. / - It's over.

322
00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:23,276
- Why diet when you have this? / - That looks good.

323
00:10:23,276 --> 00:10:24,676
It's great we came here.

324
00:10:24,676 --> 00:10:25,843
(Watch with caution if you're hungry)

325
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:30,610
You filmed it like that on purpose?

326
00:10:30,610 --> 00:10:32,410
- That was my idea. / - We did slow motion shots.

327
00:10:33,243 --> 00:10:34,743
- That's so pretty. / - So funny.

328
00:10:35,676 --> 00:10:36,910
That was good.

329
00:10:36,910 --> 00:10:39,910
- You even wore matching outfits. / - We rented them.

330
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:46,776
(D-15, Hanoi, Vietnam)

331
00:10:48,176 --> 00:10:51,476
It's been about a year and a half living here.

332
00:10:52,143 --> 00:10:54,476
I go back and forth between Korea and Vietnam,

333
00:10:54,476 --> 00:10:56,643
and I'm preparing to open a business.

334
00:10:56,643 --> 00:10:58,443
The kids are going to school here

335
00:10:58,443 --> 00:11:00,643
and my wife lives here.

336
00:11:00,643 --> 00:11:02,176
I think Gyeonghwan's doing more TV shows

337
00:11:02,176 --> 00:11:03,910
after moving to Vietnam.

338
00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:05,476
He's so busy these days.

339
00:11:05,476 --> 00:11:07,343
I've been to almost every place

340
00:11:07,343 --> 00:11:08,743
so I can introduce it to people.

341
00:11:08,743 --> 00:11:10,243
I've been to a lot of places.

342
00:11:10,243 --> 00:11:12,276
He really went to all of those places...

343
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:13,676
For us.

344
00:11:16,276 --> 00:11:17,710
(Yeom Gyeonghwan)

345
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:19,276
(Been living in Hanoi for 2 years with family)

346
00:11:19,276 --> 00:11:20,776
Do you know that Vietnam was

347
00:11:20,776 --> 00:11:22,976
on Battle Trip several times?

348
00:11:22,976 --> 00:11:25,076
I saw a few of the episodes.

349
00:11:25,076 --> 00:11:27,776
I saw Kwangkyu and Taecyeon

350
00:11:27,776 --> 00:11:29,543
drinking egg coffee.

351
00:11:29,543 --> 00:11:32,410
I'm going to places even locals don't know about.

352
00:11:32,410 --> 00:11:35,743
Tourists will obviously not know about these places.

353
00:11:35,743 --> 00:11:38,410
I will reveal places that

354
00:11:38,410 --> 00:11:41,443
even Hanoi locals haven't visited.

355
00:11:41,443 --> 00:11:42,310
I'll show it all to you.

356
00:11:42,976 --> 00:11:43,876
I'll reveal them.

357
00:11:43,876 --> 00:11:44,643
(Where could it be?)

358
00:11:44,976 --> 00:11:46,810
- Hanoi. / - Hanoi.

359
00:11:46,810 --> 00:11:48,010
You go to Hanoi.

360
00:11:49,243 --> 00:11:50,743
- We should've planned. / - Right now...

361
00:11:50,743 --> 00:11:51,810
Look at this.

362
00:11:51,810 --> 00:11:53,076
Here.

363
00:11:53,076 --> 00:11:55,076
I marked the places with red dots.

364
00:11:55,076 --> 00:11:56,643
- Trip designer. / - I marked them.

365
00:11:56,643 --> 00:11:59,010
I always research before my trip.

366
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:01,310
The other colors are the places I want to visit.

367
00:12:01,310 --> 00:12:03,410
- I always do my research. / - I looked them up.

368
00:12:03,410 --> 00:12:07,043
I usually ask my friend who lives in that country.

369
00:12:07,043 --> 00:12:08,510
And so now...

370
00:12:08,510 --> 00:12:09,610
We have a friend who lives there.

371
00:12:09,610 --> 00:12:11,276
I found out that we do.

372
00:12:11,276 --> 00:12:12,143
Yeom Gyeonghwan...

373
00:12:12,143 --> 00:12:13,176
I'm not happy about him.

374
00:12:13,176 --> 00:12:14,443
I'm not happy about him.

375
00:12:14,443 --> 00:12:15,143
That's what we were like.

376
00:12:15,143 --> 00:12:16,676
Sunyeong didn't like it at first.

377
00:12:16,676 --> 00:12:19,543
I thought we wouldn't be a good fit.

378
00:12:19,543 --> 00:12:21,543
There are places that women want to visit.

379
00:12:21,543 --> 00:12:23,410
He's a great senior.

380
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:25,043
He's so good-natured and kind,

381
00:12:25,043 --> 00:12:27,243
but I don't feel he'll give us what we want.

382
00:12:27,243 --> 00:12:29,276
Like wearing elegant dresses revealing our backs...

383
00:12:29,276 --> 00:12:31,243
Taking 50,000 photos.

384
00:12:31,243 --> 00:12:34,410
Places where you can take 500 photos over a cocktail.

385
00:12:34,410 --> 00:12:35,376
He won't take us to nice places.

386
00:12:35,376 --> 00:12:37,243
I feel like he'll just take us to markets.

387
00:12:37,243 --> 00:12:38,610
He'll just take us to markets.

388
00:12:38,610 --> 00:12:40,743
- I like markets. / - I don't mind them either but...

389
00:12:40,743 --> 00:12:45,110
You have to go to markets and also nice places.

390
00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:47,676
We can't just visit the market.

391
00:12:47,676 --> 00:12:48,776
- The places that women like. / - Then..

392
00:12:48,776 --> 00:12:50,476
- No. / - Will he know those places?

393
00:12:50,476 --> 00:12:53,476
But if we tell him in advance,

394
00:12:53,476 --> 00:12:55,510
he'd check it out by himself.

395
00:12:55,510 --> 00:12:59,443
He'll get the help of locals.

396
00:12:59,443 --> 00:13:01,643
So if we make a list for him...

397
00:13:01,643 --> 00:13:03,243
I want to dress in ao dai...

398
00:13:03,243 --> 00:13:04,676
- And eat banh mi. / - A banh mi...

399
00:13:04,676 --> 00:13:06,576
I was going to eat banh mi 3 times a day.

400
00:13:06,576 --> 00:13:08,376
And we should drink Vietnamese coffee.

401
00:13:08,376 --> 00:13:09,143
Condensed milk coffee.

402
00:13:09,143 --> 00:13:10,376
- They're planning the scenario. / - Okay.

403
00:13:10,376 --> 00:13:12,310
Why am I getting excited for the trip?

404
00:13:12,310 --> 00:13:13,110
It's worth getting excited about.

405
00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:14,610
Your wish list is full.

406
00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:18,043
(This is the wish list in question)

407
00:13:23,543 --> 00:13:24,843
He seems clueless.

408
00:13:24,843 --> 00:13:25,676
He doesn't look happy.

409
00:13:25,676 --> 00:13:26,810
He doesn't look happy.

410
00:13:26,810 --> 00:13:29,176
But the weather

411
00:13:29,176 --> 00:13:31,176
isn't that warm yet.

412
00:13:31,176 --> 00:13:33,643
Hanoi's winter

413
00:13:33,643 --> 00:13:35,376
is similar to Korea.

414
00:13:35,376 --> 00:13:38,310
Of course, it doesn't snow and it isn't that cold.

415
00:13:38,310 --> 00:13:41,243
- But it can get suddenly cold. / - He looks sad.

416
00:13:41,243 --> 00:13:42,443
I'm not sure if this will work.

417
00:13:43,510 --> 00:13:45,510
I want to eat healthy food...

418
00:13:45,510 --> 00:13:46,743
- That's his wife. / - That's his wife.

419
00:13:46,743 --> 00:13:48,543
Our reinforcements.

420
00:13:48,543 --> 00:13:50,043
I was thinking about

421
00:13:50,043 --> 00:13:51,776
recommending health foods...

422
00:13:51,776 --> 00:13:54,876
No, they're on holiday. Why would they eat that?

423
00:13:54,876 --> 00:13:56,676
He wanted to feed us health foods.

424
00:13:56,676 --> 00:13:57,776
He suggested we eat turtle.

425
00:13:57,776 --> 00:13:59,276
And goat!

426
00:14:01,476 --> 00:14:03,376
This is the type of trip that women like.

427
00:14:03,376 --> 00:14:05,176
They like going to nice bars

428
00:14:05,176 --> 00:14:06,876
and taking photos.

429
00:14:06,876 --> 00:14:09,910
I think a trip they can enjoy would be nice.

430
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:11,976
I think his wife saved your trip.

431
00:14:11,976 --> 00:14:13,176
You're right.

432
00:14:13,176 --> 00:14:13,776
Isn't that cheating?

433
00:14:13,776 --> 00:14:15,810
- Shouldn't Gyeonghwan plan this? / - I got goose bumps.

434
00:14:15,810 --> 00:14:17,543
- This isn't Yeom Tour then. / - Here it comes.

435
00:14:18,110 --> 00:14:19,176
- Oh, dear. / - So beautiful.

436
00:14:26,010 --> 00:14:29,343
This is women's only trip, right?

437
00:14:29,343 --> 00:14:32,210
So it's a trip for people who are married

438
00:14:32,210 --> 00:14:33,243
or to go with friends.

439
00:14:33,243 --> 00:14:36,143
It's a trip that every woman can enjoy.

440
00:14:36,143 --> 00:14:38,543
- Sounds fun. / - You get the best of both worlds.

441
00:14:38,543 --> 00:14:39,676
(Korea)

442
00:14:39,676 --> 00:14:40,676
(Hanoi)

443
00:14:40,676 --> 00:14:45,643
(The flight takes 4 hours)

444
00:14:46,810 --> 00:14:48,510
Xin chao, Hanoi!

445
00:14:48,510 --> 00:14:49,676
Xin chao, Hanoi!

446
00:14:50,476 --> 00:14:52,143
(Arriving in Hanoi)

447
00:14:52,143 --> 00:14:53,810
(As soon as they arrive, they burst out laughing)

448
00:14:54,010 --> 00:14:55,676
Xin chao, Hanoi!

449
00:14:55,676 --> 00:14:56,776
Xin chao, Hanoi!

450
00:14:56,776 --> 00:14:58,710
Why am I embarrassed?

451
00:14:58,710 --> 00:14:59,310
Geez...

452
00:14:59,310 --> 00:15:00,043
Do you like it?

453
00:15:00,043 --> 00:15:02,110
- There's a photo too. / - Of course.

454
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:03,643
- It's round. / - It's so cute.

455
00:15:03,643 --> 00:15:05,843
- I was going to make one. / - He put his own photo.

456
00:15:06,576 --> 00:15:07,876
Isn't that cute?

457
00:15:07,876 --> 00:15:08,910
It is cute.

458
00:15:08,910 --> 00:15:10,043
- "Customers of Yeom Tour." / - Really.

459
00:15:10,043 --> 00:15:11,310
He put a lot of thought into it.

460
00:15:14,110 --> 00:15:16,310
We haven't met in ages so I shouldn't say this but...

461
00:15:16,310 --> 00:15:18,743
- I'm already sick of you. / - Listen.

462
00:15:18,743 --> 00:15:19,876
How long have you been waiting like that?

463
00:15:19,876 --> 00:15:21,843
Why are you wearing sunglasses now?

464
00:15:21,843 --> 00:15:23,576
- You're inside the airport. / - We're embarrassed.

465
00:15:23,576 --> 00:15:24,510
You're embarrassing.

466
00:15:24,510 --> 00:15:25,343
Let's get out of here first.

467
00:15:25,343 --> 00:15:28,243
- Can't we just say bye here? / - Yeah.

468
00:15:28,243 --> 00:15:30,143
- I have to guide you. / - I've planned everything.

469
00:15:30,143 --> 00:15:31,143
I know everything.

470
00:15:31,143 --> 00:15:32,510
Don't take us to boring places.

471
00:15:32,510 --> 00:15:34,543
Come on out. Just trust me.

472
00:15:34,543 --> 00:15:35,576
Why do I have a heavy heart?

473
00:15:35,576 --> 00:15:36,576
Get in, please.

474
00:15:37,376 --> 00:15:38,976
Oh, no.

475
00:15:38,976 --> 00:15:40,176
Get on.

476
00:15:40,176 --> 00:15:41,743
Hoan Kiem please.

477
00:15:42,776 --> 00:15:43,576
You're getting on too, right?

478
00:15:43,576 --> 00:15:44,710
Yes, I have to get on too.

479
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:46,410
- You're not just sending us? / - Right?

480
00:15:46,410 --> 00:15:47,610
No, no.

481
00:15:47,610 --> 00:15:48,676
Don't worry.

482
00:15:52,143 --> 00:15:53,243
We'll head out now.

483
00:15:58,643 --> 00:16:01,010
We're not going to a temple, right?

484
00:16:01,010 --> 00:16:03,476
They're bickering at the start...

485
00:16:03,476 --> 00:16:06,310
If this continues, we'll win.

486
00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:08,343
- No, you'll be surprised later. / - There's division.

487
00:16:08,343 --> 00:16:09,743
Do you know what we like?

488
00:16:09,743 --> 00:16:11,143
- Of course. / - Like what?

489
00:16:11,143 --> 00:16:12,243
You like good food.

490
00:16:13,043 --> 00:16:14,810
Places where you can show off.

491
00:16:14,810 --> 00:16:16,743
- Show off? / - Yes.

492
00:16:16,743 --> 00:16:18,443
- Well... / - What do you mean by that?

493
00:16:18,443 --> 00:16:19,410
All women like...

494
00:16:19,410 --> 00:16:21,610
- To take photos for SNS. / - You mean selfies?

495
00:16:21,610 --> 00:16:23,676
- Places for nice photos. / - You know such places?

496
00:16:23,676 --> 00:16:25,110
- You? / - Of course.

497
00:16:27,043 --> 00:16:28,276
There's so much distrust right now.

498
00:16:28,276 --> 00:16:29,876
Even the driver...

499
00:16:29,876 --> 00:16:32,476
They're so quiet. I feel bad.

500
00:16:34,810 --> 00:16:37,543
This bridge will lead us downtown.

501
00:16:37,543 --> 00:16:39,910
- The river below is the Red River. / - Red River?

502
00:16:39,910 --> 00:16:43,776
- The color of the river is red. / - Because it's red?

503
00:16:43,776 --> 00:16:44,710
Red River.

504
00:16:46,743 --> 00:16:49,143
Are houses more expensive near the river here?

505
00:16:49,143 --> 00:16:52,376
Yes, the view is also an important factor here.

506
00:16:52,376 --> 00:16:53,910
When they build apartments,

507
00:16:53,910 --> 00:16:55,476
they make a lake.

508
00:16:55,476 --> 00:16:56,643
They make a lake.

509
00:16:57,176 --> 00:16:58,243
We asked him all sorts of things and

510
00:16:58,243 --> 00:16:59,076
he knew the answers.

511
00:16:59,076 --> 00:17:00,376
- Apparently they do. / - What does that mean?

512
00:17:00,376 --> 00:17:01,810
So that you get a better view,

513
00:17:01,810 --> 00:17:03,643
they build an apartment and then dig out a lake.

514
00:17:03,643 --> 00:17:05,010
That's amazing.

515
00:17:05,010 --> 00:17:06,176
This is an interesting country.

516
00:17:06,176 --> 00:17:07,610
How's the cost of living here?

517
00:17:07,610 --> 00:17:10,043
I was here 15 years ago.

518
00:17:10,043 --> 00:17:12,476
Beer is cheaper than water here.

519
00:17:12,476 --> 00:17:13,810
I'll drink beer with every meal.

520
00:17:13,810 --> 00:17:15,176
I can't drink beer.

521
00:17:15,176 --> 00:17:17,610
If you just walk into any restaurant on the street,

522
00:17:17,610 --> 00:17:20,776
a meal would cost $1.50 on average.

523
00:17:20,776 --> 00:17:21,476
$1.50.

524
00:17:21,476 --> 00:17:22,643
- $1.50? / - $1.50?

525
00:17:24,476 --> 00:17:25,543
I really want to visit Vietnam.

526
00:17:25,543 --> 00:17:27,310
It's going to get really good soon.

527
00:17:27,310 --> 00:17:28,976
Things are going to pick up now.

528
00:17:28,976 --> 00:17:30,110
It's the best.

529
00:17:30,110 --> 00:17:32,176
(Noi Bai International Airport)

530
00:17:32,176 --> 00:17:33,243
(40 minutes to Hoan Kiem Lake)

531
00:17:33,243 --> 00:17:35,076
($15 by taxi)

532
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:42,743
Hoan Kiem.

533
00:17:42,743 --> 00:17:45,010
This is the busiest place in Hanoi.

534
00:17:45,010 --> 00:17:46,276
Tourist hot spot.

535
00:17:46,276 --> 00:17:47,476
Central area.

536
00:17:48,376 --> 00:17:51,310
This is a famous tourist attraction, Hoan Kiem Lake.

537
00:17:51,310 --> 00:17:54,476
Many Westerners, locals,

538
00:17:54,476 --> 00:17:55,776
and even Korean tourists come here.

539
00:17:55,776 --> 00:17:58,143
They enjoy their date around this lake.

540
00:17:58,143 --> 00:17:59,943
With this place as the center,

541
00:17:59,943 --> 00:18:02,910
there's Dong Xuan Market to the north.

542
00:18:02,910 --> 00:18:04,176
I know it.

543
00:18:04,176 --> 00:18:07,610
To the west is the hero of Vietnam,

544
00:18:07,610 --> 00:18:09,976
the Ho Chi Minh Museum.

545
00:18:09,976 --> 00:18:11,743
To the east is the opera house.

546
00:18:11,743 --> 00:18:13,310
A Vietnamese opera house.

547
00:18:14,810 --> 00:18:16,543
To the south is where

548
00:18:16,543 --> 00:18:18,910
the middle class live.

549
00:18:18,910 --> 00:18:19,910
It's a residential area.

550
00:18:21,143 --> 00:18:23,043
- Where all the locals live? / - The main street.

551
00:18:23,043 --> 00:18:25,410
- Right. / - So this is like Seokchon Lake.

552
00:18:25,410 --> 00:18:28,010
- Precisely. That's it. / - I understand now.

553
00:18:28,010 --> 00:18:30,310
Let's get something to eat first.

554
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:31,610
Let's get some delicious food.

555
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:33,210
I want banh mi.

556
00:18:33,210 --> 00:18:34,110
You want a sandwich?

557
00:18:34,110 --> 00:18:35,010
I want bun cha.

558
00:18:35,010 --> 00:18:36,210
Sandwich and bun cha.

559
00:18:36,210 --> 00:18:37,876
You've had plenty of that in Korea.

560
00:18:37,876 --> 00:18:38,843
I want local beer.

561
00:18:38,843 --> 00:18:39,943
Let's get going then.

562
00:18:39,943 --> 00:18:41,310
You have to eat something

563
00:18:41,310 --> 00:18:43,476
that's never been on the show.

564
00:18:43,476 --> 00:18:45,076
- This is what we want. / - That's the way.

565
00:18:45,076 --> 00:18:46,943
Gyeonghwan is doing a good job.

566
00:18:46,943 --> 00:18:48,710
Trust me and follow me.

567
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:50,376
- I have a bad feeling about this. / - Follow me.

568
00:18:50,376 --> 00:18:51,210
Go, go, go.

569
00:18:51,776 --> 00:18:55,010
- It's the alley across the street. / - Where are the lights?

570
00:18:55,010 --> 00:18:57,776
You have to learn to cross on your own.

571
00:18:57,776 --> 00:18:59,110
- On your own? / - So basically...

572
00:18:59,110 --> 00:19:00,743
Never run.

573
00:19:00,743 --> 00:19:02,676
See those motorbikes?

574
00:19:02,676 --> 00:19:03,743
What you do is,

575
00:19:03,743 --> 00:19:05,143
just walk at your pace

576
00:19:05,143 --> 00:19:08,010
and the bikes will drive past you.

577
00:19:08,010 --> 00:19:09,876
The traffic will avoid you.

578
00:19:09,876 --> 00:19:11,276
What if they don't?

579
00:19:11,276 --> 00:19:11,943
They will.

580
00:19:11,943 --> 00:19:13,743
- He wasn't kidding. / - They never hit you.

581
00:19:13,743 --> 00:19:14,910
- You can't stop. / - You must not stop.

582
00:19:14,910 --> 00:19:17,143
That's basic info you must know before you go.

583
00:19:17,143 --> 00:19:17,743
My goodness.

584
00:19:17,743 --> 00:19:19,710
A lot of people just cross the street.

585
00:19:19,710 --> 00:19:23,110
We have to walk while keeping the same pace.

586
00:19:23,110 --> 00:19:23,610
Don't be scared.

587
00:19:23,610 --> 00:19:25,076
- We don't need to do this? / - We don't?

588
00:19:25,076 --> 00:19:26,676
Let us cross the street now.

589
00:19:26,676 --> 00:19:28,443
Since the cars are coming from this side...

590
00:19:28,443 --> 00:19:29,743
Why aren't they coming from both sides?

591
00:19:29,743 --> 00:19:31,110
Just look to your right.

592
00:19:31,110 --> 00:19:32,343
It's one way here.

593
00:19:32,343 --> 00:19:33,376
That's right. Look to your right.

594
00:19:33,876 --> 00:19:37,043
(They take a step onto the road)

595
00:19:37,043 --> 00:19:38,210
Look to your right.

596
00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:39,243
Just a minute.

597
00:19:39,243 --> 00:19:40,276
Just a minute.

598
00:19:41,310 --> 00:19:42,510
Just a minute.

599
00:19:42,510 --> 00:19:43,110
- You scared me. / - The car.

600
00:19:43,110 --> 00:19:44,443
It was coming at us.

601
00:19:44,443 --> 00:19:45,410
So the thing is...

602
00:19:45,410 --> 00:19:46,810
That person in front is walking so casually.

603
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:48,243
That van! That van!

604
00:19:48,243 --> 00:19:48,876
No, don't.

605
00:19:50,410 --> 00:19:51,910
That's it. You're doing well.

606
00:19:51,910 --> 00:19:53,543
- I don't think I can do it. / - That's the way.

607
00:19:55,010 --> 00:19:56,776
- Like a local. / - You're doing well.

608
00:19:56,776 --> 00:19:58,143
- You're doing well. / - Oh, my.

609
00:19:58,143 --> 00:19:59,443
- The cars are just coming at her. / - Be careful.

610
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:04,076
- I don't think I can do this. / - You're doing well.

611
00:20:04,076 --> 00:20:05,010
Just walk like that.

612
00:20:05,010 --> 00:20:06,143
But don't mess around.

613
00:20:06,143 --> 00:20:07,376
Don't mess around too much.

614
00:20:08,376 --> 00:20:10,276
Let's cross. Just look this way.

615
00:20:10,276 --> 00:20:13,610
- If you're scared, just look ahead. / - Follow me.

616
00:20:13,610 --> 00:20:14,310
Why aren't  you coming?

617
00:20:14,310 --> 00:20:15,376
Why aren't  you coming?

618
00:20:17,876 --> 00:20:19,876
- You shouldn't do that. / - You shouldn't.

619
00:20:19,876 --> 00:20:22,310
If you do that, the scooters can't judge.

620
00:20:23,543 --> 00:20:24,943
No, don't do that.

621
00:20:24,943 --> 00:20:27,110
Just walk. Don't run.

622
00:20:28,076 --> 00:20:29,410
I told you not to run.

623
00:20:29,410 --> 00:20:31,310
That guy honked at me.

624
00:20:31,310 --> 00:20:33,943
You have to walk at a constant speed

625
00:20:33,943 --> 00:20:35,076
for the bikes to avoid you.

626
00:20:35,076 --> 00:20:36,476
But you stopped halfway.

627
00:20:36,476 --> 00:20:37,876
Then you ran.

628
00:20:37,876 --> 00:20:38,676
That's dangerous.

629
00:20:38,676 --> 00:20:39,743
I didn't know.

630
00:20:41,110 --> 00:20:44,243
But I feel like I lived here in my previous life.

631
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:46,276
- This place... / - This place feels familiar.

632
00:20:46,276 --> 00:20:48,410
This alley is 1,000 years old.

633
00:20:48,410 --> 00:20:49,610
- Really? / - Yes.

634
00:20:49,610 --> 00:20:51,076
We should take photos then.

635
00:20:51,076 --> 00:20:52,343
Take a photo of us.

636
00:20:52,343 --> 00:20:54,543
Do you want full-length shots?

637
00:20:54,543 --> 00:20:56,076
- Yes. / - Okay.

638
00:20:56,076 --> 00:20:57,476
1, 2, 3.

639
00:20:58,676 --> 00:21:00,476
- You're good at taking photos. / - Isn't this nice?

640
00:21:00,476 --> 00:21:01,643
I really like this.

641
00:21:01,643 --> 00:21:03,743
I'm starting to like my guide, little by little.

642
00:21:03,743 --> 00:21:06,976
It's important to upload photos on SNS for women.

643
00:21:06,976 --> 00:21:08,610
I graduated art school.

644
00:21:08,610 --> 00:21:09,610
I graduated art school.

645
00:21:10,476 --> 00:21:11,376
I am an art school graduate.

646
00:21:11,376 --> 00:21:12,410
You were?

647
00:21:13,243 --> 00:21:14,243
He took such a nice photo.

648
00:21:14,243 --> 00:21:15,176
This way please.

649
00:21:15,176 --> 00:21:16,310
- That was when... / - That's so nice.

650
00:21:16,310 --> 00:21:18,410
We started to like Gyeonghwan.

651
00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:20,176
It really makes you open up

652
00:21:20,176 --> 00:21:21,343
if they're good at taking photos.

653
00:21:21,776 --> 00:21:23,276
I love this.

654
00:21:24,010 --> 00:21:25,043
That's a pig's hoof.

655
00:21:26,043 --> 00:21:27,176
That's a pig's hoof.

656
00:21:29,543 --> 00:21:30,843
How cute.

657
00:21:30,843 --> 00:21:32,343
- Hello. / - That's so cute.

658
00:21:32,343 --> 00:21:33,876
- Hello. / - That's so cute.

659
00:21:35,576 --> 00:21:37,176
There are so many flowers.

660
00:21:43,476 --> 00:21:45,110
- We'll eat here. / - Is this the place?

661
00:21:45,110 --> 00:21:46,776
- Here? / - This is where we're eating.

662
00:21:46,776 --> 00:21:48,176
- I love it. / - It's here.

663
00:21:48,876 --> 00:21:49,676
Please go in.

664
00:21:49,676 --> 00:21:51,410
- My gosh. / - Was he a regular there?

665
00:21:51,410 --> 00:21:53,210
- This is so cute. / - Yes, he goes there often.

666
00:21:53,210 --> 00:21:54,843
He takes his kids there often too.

667
00:21:55,543 --> 00:21:57,910
(What do you associate Vietnam with?)

668
00:21:59,210 --> 00:22:00,243
- Pho. / - That looks delicious.

669
00:22:00,243 --> 00:22:01,543
- You did eat rice noodles. / - Looks so good.

670
00:22:01,543 --> 00:22:02,910
- No, no. / - Banh mi.

671
00:22:02,910 --> 00:22:05,110
- There're so many good restaurants. / - Banh mi.

672
00:22:05,110 --> 00:22:06,743
So you didn't eat any of that?

673
00:22:06,743 --> 00:22:08,010
We don't.

674
00:22:11,343 --> 00:22:12,310
Watch this.

675
00:22:12,310 --> 00:22:13,376
- Sticky rice. / - What is that?

676
00:22:13,376 --> 00:22:14,843
- That looks good. / - Vietnamese sticky rice.

677
00:22:14,843 --> 00:22:16,310
- What is that? / - Isn't that amazing?

678
00:22:16,310 --> 00:22:18,143
- What? / - First time you've seen that, right?

679
00:22:19,576 --> 00:22:21,643
People in Vietnam also eat sticky rice.

680
00:22:21,643 --> 00:22:22,743
- Sticky rice? / - Sticky rice?

681
00:22:22,743 --> 00:22:23,276
So in Vietnam...

682
00:22:23,276 --> 00:22:25,843
Don't people in Vietnam eat Indica rice?

683
00:22:25,843 --> 00:22:27,110
- But... / - I like that kind of rice.

684
00:22:27,110 --> 00:22:29,743
Everyone's tried that rice already.

685
00:22:29,743 --> 00:22:31,143
Corn sticky rice.

686
00:22:31,143 --> 00:22:32,076
I love corn.

687
00:22:32,076 --> 00:22:33,610
White sticky rice.

688
00:22:33,610 --> 00:22:36,376
- I strongly recommend this. / - It sounds delicious.

689
00:22:36,376 --> 00:22:37,476
Garlic.

690
00:22:37,476 --> 00:22:38,876
Garlic sticky rice sounds good.

691
00:22:39,576 --> 00:22:40,643
Garlic.

692
00:22:40,643 --> 00:22:42,076
They eat a lot of garlic here too?

693
00:22:42,076 --> 00:22:43,176
It's not like we have

694
00:22:43,176 --> 00:22:45,210
anyone to whisper to here.

695
00:22:45,210 --> 00:22:46,043
We'll breathe on you.

696
00:22:46,043 --> 00:22:47,710
We'll breathe on you.

697
00:22:47,710 --> 00:22:49,910
Just eat a variety.

698
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:51,143
I recommend...

699
00:22:51,143 --> 00:22:53,343
There's a Vietnamese soy drink.

700
00:22:53,343 --> 00:22:54,310
Soy milk?

701
00:22:54,310 --> 00:22:55,443
It's soy milk.

702
00:22:55,443 --> 00:22:56,343
- I'd like that. / - I'd like that.

703
00:22:56,343 --> 00:22:57,110
He's funny.

704
00:22:57,110 --> 00:22:59,110
- He prepared sticky rice and soy milk. / - Right.

705
00:22:59,110 --> 00:23:01,510
- I never imagined it. / - That's right.

706
00:23:01,510 --> 00:23:02,943
Here it comes, here it comes.

707
00:23:02,943 --> 00:23:04,710
Here it comes, here it comes.

708
00:23:10,143 --> 00:23:10,910
Goodness.

709
00:23:12,110 --> 00:23:13,376
It's like red bean dessert.

710
00:23:14,776 --> 00:23:16,210
- This is... / - Where's the rice? Wait.

711
00:23:16,676 --> 00:23:18,376
- This is... / - Where's the rice?

712
00:23:18,376 --> 00:23:19,776
The rice is in here.

713
00:23:20,610 --> 00:23:21,510
- Wait a minute. / - The rice is inside.

714
00:23:21,510 --> 00:23:22,810
There's dust in my food.

715
00:23:22,810 --> 00:23:24,143
No, this is pork.

716
00:23:24,143 --> 00:23:25,076
- What? / - Really?

717
00:23:25,076 --> 00:23:27,776
They dried the pork.

718
00:23:27,776 --> 00:23:29,443
- This? / - And seasoned it.

719
00:23:29,443 --> 00:23:31,376
And then cut it like string.

720
00:23:31,376 --> 00:23:32,376
No way.

721
00:23:32,376 --> 00:23:33,243
That's pork.

722
00:23:33,243 --> 00:23:34,843
- Like in China. / - Pulling it like this.

723
00:23:34,843 --> 00:23:36,976
- They eat it often in China. / - But that...

724
00:23:36,976 --> 00:23:39,076
It was meaty without any fat.

725
00:23:40,143 --> 00:23:41,476
- It must be dried. / - Yes.

726
00:23:41,876 --> 00:23:43,243
What is this one?

727
00:23:43,243 --> 00:23:44,143
That one.

728
00:23:44,143 --> 00:23:46,976
They made beef jerky into jelly.

729
00:23:46,976 --> 00:23:48,643
What about this one? Is this liver?

730
00:23:48,643 --> 00:23:49,876
It's Vietnamese ham.

731
00:23:49,876 --> 00:23:50,876
- They made it here. / - Ham?

732
00:23:50,876 --> 00:23:52,310
- It's good. / - That looks good.

733
00:23:52,310 --> 00:23:53,376
Traditional Vietnamese ham.

734
00:23:54,410 --> 00:23:56,110
So you eat them like side dishes?

735
00:23:56,110 --> 00:23:58,443
You can eat everything together.

736
00:23:59,576 --> 00:24:00,243
What?

737
00:24:01,210 --> 00:24:01,876
Why? Is it no good?

738
00:24:02,476 --> 00:24:03,876
What? What?

739
00:24:03,876 --> 00:24:04,910
It's so good.

740
00:24:05,776 --> 00:24:07,843
Unlike Indica rice, it fills your stomach.

741
00:24:09,643 --> 00:24:11,176
(Yum)

742
00:24:11,176 --> 00:24:12,276
The garlic is good.

743
00:24:12,276 --> 00:24:13,643
It's chewy. The garlic is good.

744
00:24:13,643 --> 00:24:14,743
I strongly recommend it.

745
00:24:14,743 --> 00:24:16,610
I could hear the sound of the motorcycles,

746
00:24:16,610 --> 00:24:17,710
people talking,

747
00:24:17,710 --> 00:24:19,576
bargaining in the market...

748
00:24:19,576 --> 00:24:20,976
You feel like a local.

749
00:24:22,776 --> 00:24:25,276
You know the yellow corn they sell at Myeong-dong?

750
00:24:25,276 --> 00:24:27,010
- The white one. / - Not the imported ones.

751
00:24:27,010 --> 00:24:30,243
- The white waxy corn. / - Yeah, that.

752
00:24:30,243 --> 00:24:32,843
So this is the Vietnamese style bibimbap.

753
00:24:32,843 --> 00:24:34,576
It's got all the garnish you need.

754
00:24:35,243 --> 00:24:37,210
Vietnamese ham, fried egg,

755
00:24:37,210 --> 00:24:38,510
dried pork,

756
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:39,876
sausage.

757
00:24:39,876 --> 00:24:42,310
You can eat it how you like in DIY fashion.

758
00:24:42,310 --> 00:24:43,510
That's the joy of it.

759
00:24:43,510 --> 00:24:45,710
It's different to Thai sticky rice.

760
00:24:45,710 --> 00:24:48,376
- It's different. / - Thai or Hong Kong sticky rice...

761
00:24:48,376 --> 00:24:50,076
Is really glutinous.

762
00:24:50,076 --> 00:24:52,210
Rice wrapped in banana leaf is...

763
00:24:52,210 --> 00:24:55,110
Sweet even if it has salty meat.

764
00:24:55,110 --> 00:24:56,510
That's why it tastes like a dessert.

765
00:24:56,510 --> 00:24:58,643
- This isn't like that. / - This tastes like a main.

766
00:24:58,643 --> 00:25:01,076
It's in between our sticky rice with grains

767
00:25:01,076 --> 00:25:03,210
and the stone pot rice.

768
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:04,043
It's good.

769
00:25:04,876 --> 00:25:07,276
Hey, this is really good.

770
00:25:07,276 --> 00:25:08,043
Thank you.

771
00:25:08,876 --> 00:25:10,043
Vietnamese soy milk.

772
00:25:10,043 --> 00:25:11,176
- Oh, that... / - Soy milk.

773
00:25:11,176 --> 00:25:13,110
- I liked it so much. / - It's so good.

774
00:25:13,510 --> 00:25:14,376
It's delicious.

775
00:25:14,376 --> 00:25:15,210
That's tasty.

776
00:25:15,210 --> 00:25:17,576
How do you say thank you?

777
00:25:17,576 --> 00:25:18,043
How?

778
00:25:18,043 --> 00:25:19,076
Cam on.

779
00:25:19,076 --> 00:25:19,876
- Cam on. / - Thank you.

780
00:25:19,876 --> 00:25:20,776
- Cam on? / - Cam on.

781
00:25:20,776 --> 00:25:21,576
- Cam on. / - Yeah.

782
00:25:21,576 --> 00:25:22,143
Cam on.

783
00:25:22,143 --> 00:25:23,376
Miss, cam on!

784
00:25:24,043 --> 00:25:25,143
Cam on.

785
00:25:25,143 --> 00:25:28,610
It's like halfway between soy and regular milk.

786
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:29,676
Welcome to Hanoi.

787
00:25:29,676 --> 00:25:30,776
This is so good.

788
00:25:32,943 --> 00:25:34,076
It's soy milk...

789
00:25:34,076 --> 00:25:34,943
Soy milk.

790
00:25:34,943 --> 00:25:35,643
Made from beans.

791
00:25:36,110 --> 00:25:37,443
Goodness, she's drinking it all.

792
00:25:37,443 --> 00:25:38,376
- Goodness. / - Bottoms up.

793
00:25:38,376 --> 00:25:39,443
She's drinking bottoms up.

794
00:25:39,443 --> 00:25:40,943
Look at her neck.

795
00:25:40,943 --> 00:25:42,176
- Are you okay? / - She's like us.

796
00:25:42,176 --> 00:25:43,310
You're with us if you drink bottoms up.

797
00:25:43,310 --> 00:25:43,976
Is it that good?

798
00:25:43,976 --> 00:25:45,876
It was so good that I...

799
00:25:45,876 --> 00:25:46,976
This is really good.

800
00:25:50,843 --> 00:25:51,776
This costs 50 cents.

801
00:25:52,543 --> 00:25:53,743
This equivalents to 50 cents.

802
00:25:53,743 --> 00:25:54,843
- It's 10,000 dong. / - 50 cents?

803
00:25:56,110 --> 00:25:59,276
Pho that you eat anywhere here

804
00:25:59,276 --> 00:26:00,076
is 30,000 dong.

805
00:26:00,076 --> 00:26:02,476
This is with all the garnish

806
00:26:02,476 --> 00:26:03,676
and it's 40,000 dong.

807
00:26:03,676 --> 00:26:04,843
So that's...

808
00:26:05,976 --> 00:26:07,276
- $2? / - $2.

809
00:26:07,276 --> 00:26:08,510
- It's so cheap. / - Not $20?

810
00:26:08,510 --> 00:26:09,910
Compared to pho...

811
00:26:09,910 --> 00:26:12,510
This is 50 cents more expensive.

812
00:26:13,576 --> 00:26:14,543
One more thing.

813
00:26:14,543 --> 00:26:16,376
I have another place in mind to visit after this meal.

814
00:26:16,376 --> 00:26:17,976
- You said you love coffee. / - Yes.

815
00:26:17,976 --> 00:26:19,843
We're going to drink some coffee.

816
00:26:20,743 --> 00:26:22,443
It's not just regular coffee.

817
00:26:22,443 --> 00:26:24,743
It's incredibly good coffee.

818
00:26:24,743 --> 00:26:26,276
Plus it's the best location

819
00:26:26,276 --> 00:26:28,810
for the show off photos you want.

820
00:26:28,810 --> 00:26:30,310
Let me get changed first.

821
00:26:30,310 --> 00:26:31,110
Can we get changed?

822
00:26:31,776 --> 00:26:33,243
It doesn't matter but isn't it a bother?

823
00:26:33,243 --> 00:26:34,243
Not at all!

824
00:26:35,943 --> 00:26:37,776
We have to take photos at a beautiful cafe.

825
00:26:37,776 --> 00:26:38,676
Let's go then.

826
00:26:38,676 --> 00:26:40,976
You have to get changed 3 times a day on a trip.

827
00:26:42,010 --> 00:26:43,910
I think Gyeonghwan is sick of you now.

828
00:26:43,910 --> 00:26:45,343
He kind of was.

829
00:26:45,343 --> 00:26:46,376
It's only been a few hours since you met.

830
00:26:46,376 --> 00:26:48,143
Isn't it so pretty there?

831
00:26:48,143 --> 00:26:51,043
- I love it. / - I love it.

832
00:26:54,176 --> 00:26:56,210
- You must do this. / - That was on our wish list.

833
00:26:56,210 --> 00:26:57,876
Taking photos in Vietnamese traditional garments.

834
00:26:57,876 --> 00:26:59,476
Everyone should try this.

835
00:26:59,476 --> 00:27:00,976
On your wish list,

836
00:27:00,976 --> 00:27:03,243
you wrote that you wanted to take

837
00:27:03,243 --> 00:27:05,343
5 million photos in beautiful ao dai.

838
00:27:05,343 --> 00:27:06,376
We're in a foreign country so

839
00:27:06,376 --> 00:27:07,676
we should try foreign dress.

840
00:27:07,676 --> 00:27:08,176
That's right.

841
00:27:08,176 --> 00:27:09,910
Let's choose your dresses first.

842
00:27:09,910 --> 00:27:11,210
These are too small.

843
00:27:11,210 --> 00:27:12,410
These are too small.

844
00:27:12,410 --> 00:27:13,276
Are we going to buy them?

845
00:27:13,276 --> 00:27:14,843
They have large sizes.

846
00:27:14,843 --> 00:27:16,143
- Really? / - Don't worry.

847
00:27:16,143 --> 00:27:17,610
They carry every size.

848
00:27:17,610 --> 00:27:18,810
Thing is,

849
00:27:18,810 --> 00:27:20,910
because I'm tall...

850
00:27:20,910 --> 00:27:22,543
I was really worried.

851
00:27:22,543 --> 00:27:24,743
You can rent these. It costs $10.

852
00:27:25,343 --> 00:27:26,776
Why don't we take a look?

853
00:27:27,943 --> 00:27:29,543
Let me give you a tip.

854
00:27:31,376 --> 00:27:34,743
Married women choose colorful clothes.

855
00:27:34,743 --> 00:27:37,043
Single women choose rather plain clothes.

856
00:27:37,043 --> 00:27:38,510
- Why? / - Why?

857
00:27:38,510 --> 00:27:39,643
That's discrimination.

858
00:27:39,643 --> 00:27:41,610
- That's the Vietnamese culture. / - Why is that?

859
00:27:41,610 --> 00:27:43,576
If I don't, is that a violation of the law?

860
00:27:43,576 --> 00:27:44,810
No, it's not a violation.

861
00:27:44,810 --> 00:27:47,676
It's true that I'm married

862
00:27:47,676 --> 00:27:50,376
but I don't have to show that off on a trip.

863
00:27:50,376 --> 00:27:51,843
- In the photos... / - That's right.

864
00:27:51,843 --> 00:27:53,343
I'll just wear the one I like.

865
00:27:53,343 --> 00:27:54,610
Choose whatever you want.

866
00:27:54,610 --> 00:27:57,576
Some dresses cover necks and some don't.

867
00:27:57,576 --> 00:27:58,310
This is pretty.

868
00:27:58,310 --> 00:27:59,343
Is this considered plain here?

869
00:27:59,910 --> 00:28:02,176
(They said they didn't care)

870
00:28:04,043 --> 00:28:05,210
Oh, madam.

871
00:28:05,210 --> 00:28:06,276
Oh, madam.

872
00:28:09,010 --> 00:28:09,743
Madam!

873
00:28:10,376 --> 00:28:11,643
Madam!

874
00:28:14,676 --> 00:28:16,043
- Madam! / - Madam!

875
00:28:16,043 --> 00:28:18,410
- Madam. / - That's for Madonna.

876
00:28:18,410 --> 00:28:20,376
That'd suit "Golden Oldies."

877
00:28:20,376 --> 00:28:21,443
No, no, no.

878
00:28:23,643 --> 00:28:25,010
- Madam. / - Life is...

879
00:28:27,010 --> 00:28:30,210
??What should I do? ??

880
00:28:30,210 --> 00:28:31,476
??Amor fati ??

881
00:28:32,710 --> 00:28:34,476
??Ao dai party ??

882
00:28:34,476 --> 00:28:35,676
(Ao dai party in the middle of the day)

883
00:28:35,676 --> 00:28:36,710
They're so good.

884
00:28:37,710 --> 00:28:40,210
(Let us present you the chosen dresses)

885
00:28:43,476 --> 00:28:44,410
So pretty.

886
00:28:45,476 --> 00:28:47,710
We hired that for an entire day for $10.

887
00:28:47,710 --> 00:28:48,743
But we ended up

888
00:28:48,743 --> 00:28:50,343
buying them at the end.

889
00:28:50,343 --> 00:28:51,643
It cost $40 to purchase.

890
00:28:51,643 --> 00:28:52,943
We paid $30 more and bought them.

891
00:28:54,510 --> 00:28:58,243
(Tall height makes people think she's from Europe)

892
00:28:58,743 --> 00:29:00,310
Doesn't she look like German?

893
00:29:01,376 --> 00:29:03,376
- She's too big. / - Don't say that.

894
00:29:03,976 --> 00:29:06,010
That was XXL.

895
00:29:06,010 --> 00:29:07,776
It was XL.

896
00:29:07,776 --> 00:29:09,176
Mine was XL.

897
00:29:09,176 --> 00:29:11,143
(Poke)

898
00:29:13,210 --> 00:29:14,643
It's good you went together.

899
00:29:15,376 --> 00:29:17,210
They're the best of friends.

900
00:29:18,543 --> 00:29:20,310
- They make a good pair. / - Aren't you sick of us?

901
00:29:20,310 --> 00:29:21,543
They look like game characters.

902
00:29:23,876 --> 00:29:25,576
- I must be crazy. / - They're shooting a commercial.

903
00:29:26,943 --> 00:29:28,743
(Comedy that knows no boundaries)

904
00:29:29,610 --> 00:29:30,310
The people behind...

905
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:31,210
What's going on?

906
00:29:31,210 --> 00:29:32,143
What is this?

907
00:29:32,876 --> 00:29:33,710
What's going on?

908
00:29:34,876 --> 00:29:36,543
- The people behind... / - What is this?

909
00:29:38,143 --> 00:29:39,076
What is going on here?

910
00:29:41,410 --> 00:29:43,476
That's the men's ao dai.

911
00:29:43,476 --> 00:29:44,343
Men's.

912
00:29:44,343 --> 00:29:45,276
Are you a coed group?

913
00:29:46,643 --> 00:29:48,410
Gyeonghwan looks so funny.

914
00:29:51,043 --> 00:29:52,543
He looks exhausted.

915
00:29:52,543 --> 00:29:55,810
You look like you were born here.

916
00:29:55,810 --> 00:29:57,110
This suits you so well.

917
00:29:57,110 --> 00:29:59,076
- I changed my name. / - To what?

918
00:29:59,076 --> 00:30:00,076
- To E.C. / - What?

919
00:30:00,076 --> 00:30:00,776
Eye-Catching.

920
00:30:00,776 --> 00:30:01,976
- What? / - Eye-Catching.

921
00:30:02,810 --> 00:30:04,210
Let's change his to Yeom Jiangshi.

922
00:30:04,210 --> 00:30:05,443
You're E.C. and he's jiangshi.

923
00:30:06,710 --> 00:30:07,376
It has to be like this.

924
00:30:07,376 --> 00:30:09,110
Let me stick a talisman on you.

925
00:30:09,110 --> 00:30:11,243
You look like a group.

926
00:30:11,243 --> 00:30:13,376
I'm so happy right now.

927
00:30:13,376 --> 00:30:14,776
How should I say this?

928
00:30:14,776 --> 00:30:16,710
I feel confident after wearing this.

929
00:30:16,710 --> 00:30:18,710
Everyone should rent this here.

930
00:30:18,710 --> 00:30:20,243
This is happiness for $10.

931
00:30:20,243 --> 00:30:21,043
For the entire day.

932
00:30:22,176 --> 00:30:24,543
Even the door over there looks so pretty.

933
00:30:24,543 --> 00:30:26,676
Even these hanging things are so pretty.

934
00:30:27,776 --> 00:30:29,876
- Why are they so pretty? / - That's laundry!

935
00:30:29,876 --> 00:30:31,676
Eunkyeong, how about the garlic laid out to dry?

936
00:30:31,676 --> 00:30:33,276
Even the garlic is pretty.

937
00:30:33,276 --> 00:30:36,210
Can you take a photo of us sitting over there?

938
00:30:36,210 --> 00:30:37,610
- Take it with this. / - This one.

939
00:30:38,676 --> 00:30:40,043
One more time. To the side.

940
00:30:40,043 --> 00:30:41,976
1, 2, 3.

941
00:30:43,310 --> 00:30:45,776
- It's a postcard. / - Look at the color.

942
00:30:45,776 --> 00:30:46,743
You included the rail track.

943
00:30:46,743 --> 00:30:48,943
I took one with the track and one without.

944
00:30:48,943 --> 00:30:50,276
- So pretty. / - Do you like them?

945
00:30:50,276 --> 00:30:51,643
- My word. / - He's so good, right?

946
00:30:51,643 --> 00:30:52,743
How?

947
00:30:52,743 --> 00:30:54,110
He knows how to frame the picture.

948
00:30:54,110 --> 00:30:55,576
You're right.

949
00:30:55,576 --> 00:30:56,776
It really is pretty.

950
00:30:56,776 --> 00:30:59,343
- Dressed in the local clothes. / - We bought them.

951
00:30:59,343 --> 00:31:01,643
- There are cafes here. / - And small galleries.

952
00:31:01,643 --> 00:31:03,476
People actually live here too.

953
00:31:03,476 --> 00:31:05,310
There are cafes and galleries.

954
00:31:05,310 --> 00:31:07,176
A long time ago, Kwangkyu and Taecyeon

955
00:31:07,176 --> 00:31:08,943
just passed by here.

956
00:31:08,943 --> 00:31:10,110
- Oh, here! / - It's completely different.

957
00:31:10,110 --> 00:31:11,476
- They didn't go inside. / - It feels so different.

958
00:31:11,476 --> 00:31:12,743
So different to Yeom Tour.

959
00:31:12,743 --> 00:31:13,976
He's so exhausted.

960
00:31:14,643 --> 00:31:16,610
- It's different with the ao dai. / - On Yeom Tour...

961
00:31:16,610 --> 00:31:18,710
It's beautiful here...

962
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:20,510
But over there,

963
00:31:20,510 --> 00:31:23,110
you'll see the perfect cafe.

964
00:31:23,543 --> 00:31:25,976
- Gyeonghwan is a great host. / - That's right.

965
00:31:25,976 --> 00:31:28,710
He planned the best course.

966
00:31:28,710 --> 00:31:29,810
It was perfect.

967
00:31:30,743 --> 00:31:31,810
Coffee.

968
00:31:33,376 --> 00:31:35,843
Vietnamese coffee...

969
00:31:35,843 --> 00:31:38,176
You've seen plenty of coconut coffee.

970
00:31:38,176 --> 00:31:40,043
Something a bit more unique.

971
00:31:40,043 --> 00:31:41,476
A cafe that has never been introduced.

972
00:31:41,476 --> 00:31:43,510
Their coffee is the best.

973
00:31:43,510 --> 00:31:44,910
He sounds like an expert.

974
00:31:44,910 --> 00:31:45,910
- I know. / - You must go here as well.

975
00:31:45,910 --> 00:31:48,576
I looked up so many cafes before going there

976
00:31:48,576 --> 00:31:49,276
but I couldn't find that place.

977
00:31:49,276 --> 00:31:51,576
That place was nice too. Where are we going?

978
00:31:52,476 --> 00:31:55,110
Once we're at this cafe, you'll be shocked.

979
00:31:55,110 --> 00:31:55,976
Really?

980
00:31:55,976 --> 00:31:57,210
It's the perfect shock.

981
00:31:58,876 --> 00:32:03,810
(It's a little off the train track)

982
00:32:05,943 --> 00:32:08,476
Finally, we're at the cafe I'm taking you to.

983
00:32:08,943 --> 00:32:09,976
It's so pretty.

984
00:32:11,043 --> 00:32:12,676
- So pretty. / - It's really pretty, right?

985
00:32:14,543 --> 00:32:16,276
This place looks like something from a fairytale.

986
00:32:17,043 --> 00:32:18,910
It's not only pretty from the outside...

987
00:32:18,910 --> 00:32:20,810
If you go through the side here...

988
00:32:20,810 --> 00:32:22,576
- There's a space at the back. / - Let's go in.

989
00:32:22,576 --> 00:32:23,876
- That's the best part. / - Let's go in.

990
00:32:23,876 --> 00:32:25,376
- It's so pretty. / - Let's go in.

991
00:32:25,376 --> 00:32:26,376
My goodness.

992
00:32:28,476 --> 00:32:31,310
- It's so pretty. / - It'd look pretty on rainy days.

993
00:32:32,576 --> 00:32:34,010
- So pretty. / - It's so green.

994
00:32:34,010 --> 00:32:35,410
They're all alive.

995
00:32:39,276 --> 00:32:40,810
There's a reason why you shouldn't miss this place.

996
00:32:40,810 --> 00:32:43,610
It not only looks good but they have great coffee too.

997
00:32:46,010 --> 00:32:47,343
With the photos...

998
00:32:47,343 --> 00:32:48,610
I'll give you a picture of a lifetime.

999
00:32:48,610 --> 00:32:49,843
It's so... Wow!

1000
00:32:50,543 --> 00:32:51,510
- Photo time. / - Hurry.

1001
00:32:51,510 --> 00:32:52,343
Photo.

1002
00:32:52,943 --> 00:32:54,810
Now he takes photos without being asked.

1003
00:32:54,810 --> 00:32:55,910
I've adapted already.

1004
00:32:55,910 --> 00:32:57,310
He's adapted on the first day.

1005
00:32:57,310 --> 00:32:58,210
I've adapted.

1006
00:32:58,210 --> 00:32:59,910
- 1, 2, 3. / - We can trust him now.

1007
00:33:01,076 --> 00:33:03,143
- He's a good photographer. / - Look at the pictures.

1008
00:33:03,143 --> 00:33:05,010
- Art school graduate. / - So good, right?

1009
00:33:05,010 --> 00:33:07,076
- Yeom Tour will definitely happen. / - It's perfect.

1010
00:33:07,943 --> 00:33:09,610
- Let's order the coffee... / - Coffee.

1011
00:33:09,610 --> 00:33:11,243
You have to start the Vietnamese trip with coffee

1012
00:33:11,243 --> 00:33:12,310
on the first day.

1013
00:33:12,310 --> 00:33:15,143
- Caffeine is a must on trips. / - I love coffee.

1014
00:33:15,143 --> 00:33:16,276
We should know

1015
00:33:16,276 --> 00:33:18,776
the price of coffee before we order.

1016
00:33:18,776 --> 00:33:20,043
This area

1017
00:33:20,043 --> 00:33:22,443
is like Garosu-gil

1018
00:33:22,443 --> 00:33:24,776
or Gyeongnidan-gil in Korea.

1019
00:33:24,776 --> 00:33:27,843
- Then black iced coffee would be... / - It'd be costly.

1020
00:33:27,843 --> 00:33:29,276
$7 or $8.

1021
00:33:29,276 --> 00:33:32,076
- If you add something, then it'd be $10. / - Over $10.

1022
00:33:32,076 --> 00:33:33,243
So here...

1023
00:33:33,243 --> 00:33:35,810
You can use the internet and take photos as well.

1024
00:33:35,810 --> 00:33:36,943
Is there free Wi-Fi?

1025
00:33:36,943 --> 00:33:38,043
Yes, they have everything but

1026
00:33:38,043 --> 00:33:40,243
coffee is a little more expensive here.

1027
00:33:40,243 --> 00:33:42,010
How much?

1028
00:33:42,010 --> 00:33:43,443
$2.80.

1029
00:33:43,443 --> 00:33:45,143
- Then it's more expensive than the food. / - It is.

1030
00:33:45,143 --> 00:33:48,343
- It's really expensive. / - Wasn't pho $1.50?

1031
00:33:48,343 --> 00:33:50,176
If you compare it to pho,

1032
00:33:50,176 --> 00:33:52,910
the coffee here costs two bowls.

1033
00:33:53,543 --> 00:33:54,710
But still...

1034
00:33:54,710 --> 00:33:56,476
We really need pho...

1035
00:33:56,476 --> 00:33:59,410
- But women really need good coffee... / - Right.

1036
00:33:59,410 --> 00:34:01,676
- Something sweet. / - And a pretty location.

1037
00:34:01,676 --> 00:34:02,576
In terms of value,

1038
00:34:02,576 --> 00:34:05,476
it's definitely worth the two bowls.

1039
00:34:05,476 --> 00:34:07,343
Let's use the restroom twice to get the most out of it.

1040
00:34:07,343 --> 00:34:09,143
Let's use the restroom twice to get the most out of it.

1041
00:34:11,743 --> 00:34:12,610
Eunkyeong.

1042
00:34:13,710 --> 00:34:14,810
Since we're middle-aged women.

1043
00:34:17,410 --> 00:34:19,276
Goodness! That was so good.

1044
00:34:19,276 --> 00:34:22,410
(Coconut milk coffee)

1045
00:34:22,410 --> 00:34:28,043
(With coconut topping)

1046
00:34:30,476 --> 00:34:31,676
It's here.

1047
00:34:31,676 --> 00:34:33,076
I can't look at it.

1048
00:34:36,543 --> 00:34:37,643
Thank you.

1049
00:34:37,643 --> 00:34:39,210
Thank you.

1050
00:34:39,210 --> 00:34:40,543
- My goodness. / - It looks delicious.

1051
00:34:41,343 --> 00:34:42,610
- Is yours cocoa? / - Yes.

1052
00:34:42,610 --> 00:34:44,576
- This is cocoa and that is coffee. / - My gosh.

1053
00:34:45,076 --> 00:34:45,943
Thank you.

1054
00:34:45,943 --> 00:34:47,143
Thank you.

1055
00:34:51,943 --> 00:34:53,743
Busy taking photos again.

1056
00:34:53,743 --> 00:34:56,210
- Geez. / - You need photo time here.

1057
00:34:56,910 --> 00:35:00,076
Come to me...

1058
00:35:01,843 --> 00:35:03,010
Have a taste.

1059
00:35:03,610 --> 00:35:04,610
With reverent hearts.

1060
00:35:06,610 --> 00:35:07,443
Spoon.

1061
00:35:11,343 --> 00:35:12,576
It's like a fantasy.

1062
00:35:14,710 --> 00:35:15,476
This is insane.

1063
00:35:16,143 --> 00:35:17,076
Game over.

1064
00:35:17,076 --> 00:35:19,043
- It's all over here. / - It's that good?

1065
00:35:19,043 --> 00:35:22,076
- How does it taste? / - Beyond your imagination.

1066
00:35:22,610 --> 00:35:23,843
It's over here.

1067
00:35:23,843 --> 00:35:24,710
Seriously...

1068
00:35:24,710 --> 00:35:26,276
It's not dried. It's fresh pulp.

1069
00:35:26,276 --> 00:35:27,143
It's fresh.

1070
00:35:27,143 --> 00:35:28,043
Seriously...

1071
00:35:29,976 --> 00:35:30,576
What's she doing?

1072
00:35:30,576 --> 00:35:31,843
Thank you so much.

1073
00:35:31,843 --> 00:35:32,743
Thank you so much.

1074
00:35:34,276 --> 00:35:35,310
What's she doing?

1075
00:35:35,310 --> 00:35:36,543
- What was that? / - Seriously...

1076
00:35:36,543 --> 00:35:38,010
She's expressing respect.

1077
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:39,210
Do you believe?

1078
00:35:39,210 --> 00:35:40,810
- I believe. / - This is amazing.

1079
00:35:40,810 --> 00:35:42,110
Do you believe?

1080
00:35:42,110 --> 00:35:43,676
I believe.

1081
00:35:44,676 --> 00:35:46,743
Is this fresh cream and coconut pulp?

1082
00:35:46,743 --> 00:35:47,776
- No. / - It's fresh coconut pulp.

1083
00:35:47,776 --> 00:35:49,543
This white thing is coconut cream.

1084
00:35:49,543 --> 00:35:52,143
I love that they put coconut pulp in it.

1085
00:35:52,143 --> 00:35:54,576
I love coconut water.

1086
00:35:55,210 --> 00:35:56,443
I love pulp too.

1087
00:35:56,943 --> 00:35:59,843
I never imagined anyone would add this to coffee.

1088
00:36:00,210 --> 00:36:03,110
This is on a whole new level to adding ice cream on top.

1089
00:36:03,110 --> 00:36:05,376
If you don't like sweet stuff, you must drink this.

1090
00:36:05,376 --> 00:36:08,276
- I'm going to rent a room here. / - Drink this.

1091
00:36:09,343 --> 00:36:10,610
I'd drink this every day.

1092
00:36:11,143 --> 00:36:12,410
I'd like to try that.

1093
00:36:12,910 --> 00:36:14,010
We have something just as good, right?

1094
00:36:14,643 --> 00:36:15,410
Something like that, right?

1095
00:36:15,410 --> 00:36:16,176
Don't worry.

1096
00:36:16,176 --> 00:36:17,343
They're too good.

1097
00:36:17,343 --> 00:36:18,643
Previously, on the Ho Chi Minh City episode,

1098
00:36:18,643 --> 00:36:19,743
they went to a bean cafe

1099
00:36:19,743 --> 00:36:21,743
and had coconut coffee.

1100
00:36:21,743 --> 00:36:24,310
But I personally prefer this place.

1101
00:36:24,310 --> 00:36:25,510
- Do they put this in as well? / - That place is...

1102
00:36:25,510 --> 00:36:26,443
Do they give you this?

1103
00:36:26,443 --> 00:36:27,443
No, they don't.

1104
00:36:27,443 --> 00:36:29,076
That cafe was a franchise.

1105
00:36:29,076 --> 00:36:30,710
It's in Ho Chi Minh City and Hanoi.

1106
00:36:30,710 --> 00:36:31,376
- It's everywhere. / - You're right.

1107
00:36:31,376 --> 00:36:33,010
I don't count franchise coffee as coffee.

1108
00:36:33,010 --> 00:36:34,543
Coffee aficionados...

1109
00:36:34,543 --> 00:36:35,843
There has to be only one store?

1110
00:36:35,843 --> 00:36:37,143
There has to be only one original store.

1111
00:36:37,710 --> 00:36:38,776
Let me try cocoa as well.

1112
00:36:38,776 --> 00:36:40,076
Try it.

1113
00:36:40,076 --> 00:36:41,876
It's made of cocoa instead of coffee.

1114
00:36:41,876 --> 00:36:43,176
Try it. It's good too.

1115
00:36:44,610 --> 00:36:46,176
It's completely different taste.

1116
00:36:48,810 --> 00:36:50,476
It is, right?

1117
00:36:51,076 --> 00:36:52,776
Children would love this too.

1118
00:36:52,776 --> 00:36:53,510
They love it.

1119
00:36:53,510 --> 00:36:55,743
My kids, Eunyul and Eunu...

1120
00:36:55,743 --> 00:36:57,610
- Finish one each. / - They'd love it.

1121
00:36:57,610 --> 00:36:58,376
They love it.

1122
00:36:58,376 --> 00:37:01,010
If I had to choose between pho and this right now,

1123
00:37:01,010 --> 00:37:01,743
I'd choose this.

1124
00:37:01,743 --> 00:37:03,310
- More than pho. / - Because we're women.

1125
00:37:03,310 --> 00:37:05,710
- I'd eat both. / - I know what women want now.

1126
00:37:06,376 --> 00:37:08,410
Put on your best dress

1127
00:37:08,410 --> 00:37:09,310
and come with me.

1128
00:37:10,043 --> 00:37:11,676
What's the atmosphere like there?

1129
00:37:11,676 --> 00:37:15,110
Lots of trendy and show off people of Vietnam

1130
00:37:15,110 --> 00:37:15,876
are there.

1131
00:37:15,876 --> 00:37:16,876
- Okay. / - Okay!

1132
00:37:16,876 --> 00:37:18,676
- We had beer there. / - I won't lose to them.

1133
00:37:18,676 --> 00:37:19,643
- We won't lose. / - We won't lose.

1134
00:37:19,643 --> 00:37:21,276
- So this is what it's like. / - Of course.

1135
00:37:21,276 --> 00:37:22,510
Okay then.

1136
00:37:22,510 --> 00:37:24,276
Dress in your prettiest clothes

1137
00:37:24,276 --> 00:37:25,843
to outdo those people.

1138
00:37:26,576 --> 00:37:27,376
Once you're done...

1139
00:37:27,376 --> 00:37:28,843
- I'll guide you. / - We have to finish this first.

1140
00:37:29,676 --> 00:37:30,476
Bottoms up.

1141
00:37:32,143 --> 00:37:35,010
(It's a sin to leave this coffee)

1142
00:37:35,610 --> 00:37:36,676
Even the pulp.

1143
00:37:37,576 --> 00:37:40,810
(Shame... I ate it all)

1144
00:37:41,110 --> 00:37:42,443
(Coffee left over from the shoot)

1145
00:37:42,443 --> 00:37:44,143
I had three of those.

1146
00:37:44,143 --> 00:37:46,443
- Isn't that the staff waiting for you? / - Yes.

1147
00:37:48,476 --> 00:37:50,376
I had a sugar rush.

1148
00:37:53,043 --> 00:37:55,576
I feel like flying over there to drink that right now.

1149
00:37:56,110 --> 00:37:58,176
So you've had 5 drinks so far?

1150
00:37:58,176 --> 00:37:59,676
Yes, 5 drinks.

1151
00:38:00,476 --> 00:38:01,943
- As soon as you arrived... / - In half a day.

1152
00:38:06,143 --> 00:38:09,510
(They arrive at the final destination for today)

1153
00:38:11,576 --> 00:38:14,610
(He knows what his clients want now)

1154
00:38:16,776 --> 00:38:17,810
You should escort me.

1155
00:38:18,976 --> 00:38:19,976
Escort me.

1156
00:38:21,210 --> 00:38:22,110
Height, 187cm.

1157
00:38:22,110 --> 00:38:23,976
- The tallest in Hanoi. / - They're not kill heels...

1158
00:38:23,976 --> 00:38:24,676
They're just kill.

1159
00:38:24,676 --> 00:38:25,610
The tallest.

1160
00:38:25,610 --> 00:38:26,610
Goodness.

1161
00:38:27,643 --> 00:38:28,943
There's no one here.

1162
00:38:28,943 --> 00:38:29,876
- Just walk along. / - There's no one there.

1163
00:38:32,443 --> 00:38:33,443
Goodness.

1164
00:38:36,643 --> 00:38:37,610
I'm so embarrassed.

1165
00:38:37,610 --> 00:38:39,176
I'm so embarrassed.

1166
00:38:39,176 --> 00:38:40,310
I'm so embarrassed.

1167
00:38:41,410 --> 00:38:42,910
- What is this? / - So funny.

1168
00:38:42,910 --> 00:38:44,043
My goodness.

1169
00:38:44,043 --> 00:38:46,643
I had nowhere to wear that outfit.

1170
00:38:46,643 --> 00:38:48,510
Once we got out and walked along...

1171
00:38:48,510 --> 00:38:49,476
Everyone there was like...

1172
00:38:49,476 --> 00:38:51,310
They all took photos of us.

1173
00:38:51,310 --> 00:38:53,143
It was like, "Who's that?"

1174
00:38:53,143 --> 00:38:54,176
It's over here.

1175
00:38:54,176 --> 00:38:55,576
Yes.

1176
00:38:55,576 --> 00:38:56,810
This is so funny.

1177
00:38:56,810 --> 00:38:57,710
So funny.

1178
00:38:58,776 --> 00:39:01,176
We'll go to local eateries and have

1179
00:39:01,176 --> 00:39:03,576
banh mi, pho and bun cha.

1180
00:39:03,576 --> 00:39:05,110
We can do those things but

1181
00:39:05,110 --> 00:39:07,043
we should also dress up at least once...

1182
00:39:07,043 --> 00:39:08,476
When we travel.

1183
00:39:08,476 --> 00:39:10,543
Dressing up and

1184
00:39:10,543 --> 00:39:12,276
putting on thick makeup to go to

1185
00:39:12,276 --> 00:39:14,043
a classy bar is no. 1 on my list.

1186
00:39:14,043 --> 00:39:15,043
What is this?

1187
00:39:15,043 --> 00:39:17,010
You want to bare your back here?

1188
00:39:17,643 --> 00:39:19,843
I can easily grant this request.

1189
00:39:20,610 --> 00:39:21,510
But...

1190
00:39:22,143 --> 00:39:24,043
A place where you can

1191
00:39:24,043 --> 00:39:26,876
show off your figure and take photos.

1192
00:39:29,543 --> 00:39:34,510
(This place is lights up when the sun goes down)

1193
00:39:34,510 --> 00:39:35,710
(It's a rooftop pool bar)

1194
00:39:35,710 --> 00:39:36,510
What is this?

1195
00:39:36,510 --> 00:39:38,143
You've never seen this in Hanoi, right?

1196
00:39:38,143 --> 00:39:40,576
You can see the whole city.

1197
00:39:41,376 --> 00:39:43,110
- There's a hot pool. / - They had a pool.

1198
00:39:43,110 --> 00:39:45,276
- Is that a hotel rooftop? / - No.

1199
00:39:45,276 --> 00:39:47,643
- Just a rooftop. / - Just a new, hip cafe.

1200
00:39:47,643 --> 00:39:50,376
In order to cater for you two.

1201
00:39:50,376 --> 00:39:54,110
I told them to cover the elevator in this.

1202
00:39:54,110 --> 00:39:56,610
That doesn't sound right. It looks really old.

1203
00:39:56,610 --> 00:39:57,310
It's not.

1204
00:39:57,310 --> 00:40:00,676
I always dress like this

1205
00:40:00,676 --> 00:40:04,176
and go to the zoo and botanical garden with the kids.

1206
00:40:04,176 --> 00:40:05,710
- You walk around like this? / - Yes.

1207
00:40:05,710 --> 00:40:07,876
I dress like this when I go to throw out the trash.

1208
00:40:07,876 --> 00:40:10,176
This is my outfit for throwing out the trash.

1209
00:40:10,176 --> 00:40:13,576
But you should dress comfortably...

1210
00:40:13,576 --> 00:40:15,110
We're very comfortable.

1211
00:40:15,110 --> 00:40:18,676
- It looks really tight to me. / - It's not tight at all.

1212
00:40:19,643 --> 00:40:21,343
- Not at all. / - You look really uncomfortable.

1213
00:40:21,343 --> 00:40:23,510
Want me to show you again?

1214
00:40:26,143 --> 00:40:28,043
My ears are popping.

1215
00:40:28,043 --> 00:40:30,543
We're very high up. Is this the tallest building?

1216
00:40:32,243 --> 00:40:34,210
Let me show you poolside first.

1217
00:40:34,910 --> 00:40:37,476
The view here is so nice.

1218
00:40:37,476 --> 00:40:39,876
- Can you swim here as well? / - Yes, you can.

1219
00:40:39,876 --> 00:40:41,610
They have pool parties as well.

1220
00:40:41,610 --> 00:40:44,410
I thought you'd like this place.

1221
00:40:44,410 --> 00:40:47,310
I'd love to come here for brunch...

1222
00:40:47,310 --> 00:40:49,243
- Rather than for a pool party. / - Gyeonghwan.

1223
00:40:49,243 --> 00:40:50,143
Can we...

1224
00:40:50,810 --> 00:40:54,010
Many people come here for their wedding shoots.

1225
00:40:57,510 --> 00:40:59,343
- He looks cold. / - He's working so hard.

1226
00:40:59,343 --> 00:41:01,010
If there's lots of water, there are lots of mosquitoes.

1227
00:41:01,010 --> 00:41:02,810
A dagger stabs me in the heart.

1228
00:41:02,810 --> 00:41:03,443
Why?

1229
00:41:03,443 --> 00:41:04,810
But don't worry.

1230
00:41:04,810 --> 00:41:06,410
Hands are faster than eyes.

1231
00:41:06,976 --> 00:41:13,043
1, 2, 3.

1232
00:41:14,876 --> 00:41:17,210
- Let's take one more. / - So the water is in the shot?

1233
00:41:17,210 --> 00:41:20,476
- You need the pool. / - It needs to show.

1234
00:41:20,476 --> 00:41:22,176
You should really thank Gyeonghwan.

1235
00:41:22,176 --> 00:41:23,210
Did you tip him well?

1236
00:41:23,210 --> 00:41:24,876
Of course.

1237
00:41:26,076 --> 00:41:29,443
(Great pictures on Yeom Tour)

1238
00:41:29,443 --> 00:41:30,676
That photo.

1239
00:41:30,676 --> 00:41:33,210
- I've seen that photo. / - Picture of a lifetime.

1240
00:41:33,210 --> 00:41:36,810
Let's go up even further.

1241
00:41:38,176 --> 00:41:40,143
- There's no one here. / - My goodness.

1242
00:41:40,143 --> 00:41:41,943
- Isn't this just a rooftop? / - To the left.

1243
00:41:42,576 --> 00:41:45,243
Welcome.

1244
00:41:45,243 --> 00:41:47,310
- Hello. / - Hello?

1245
00:41:47,310 --> 00:41:48,776
It's "H" for hello.

1246
00:41:48,776 --> 00:41:51,676
- You can see all of Hanoi here. / - What's this?

1247
00:41:51,676 --> 00:41:53,510
It's a shrine.

1248
00:41:54,510 --> 00:41:56,276
(Flustered)

1249
00:41:56,276 --> 00:41:58,843
I think we'll get a great shot. It's okay.

1250
00:41:59,476 --> 00:42:01,176
Very good.

1251
00:42:01,910 --> 00:42:03,943
We have foreigners here

1252
00:42:03,943 --> 00:42:06,443
to get their picture of a lifetime.

1253
00:42:06,610 --> 00:42:08,710
(This is nothing)

1254
00:42:08,710 --> 00:42:11,010
We're going to get competitive now.

1255
00:42:11,010 --> 00:42:13,876
- Right now... / - I don't believe this.

1256
00:42:13,876 --> 00:42:15,710
Don't compete over things like this.

1257
00:42:16,410 --> 00:42:19,710
That's just natural for them.

1258
00:42:19,710 --> 00:42:20,976
Me too. Made in Korea.

1259
00:42:20,976 --> 00:42:23,310
- Your mom will see this. / - What?

1260
00:42:23,310 --> 00:42:25,310
Dads and moms will watch this.

1261
00:42:25,310 --> 00:42:28,776
Since you're celebrities that represent Korea...

1262
00:42:28,776 --> 00:42:30,943
- Then how about... / - What kind of shot?

1263
00:42:30,943 --> 00:42:33,376
Let's all do one each.

1264
00:42:33,376 --> 00:42:34,776
Why me?

1265
00:42:34,776 --> 00:42:38,110
- Just do it. / - We have to take your photo too.

1266
00:42:38,110 --> 00:42:40,910
- I'll just take photos for you. / - No way.

1267
00:42:40,910 --> 00:42:42,976
- Should I take this off? / - Just put that on.

1268
00:42:42,976 --> 00:42:43,610
This?

1269
00:42:43,610 --> 00:42:47,276
- To show the Yeom Tour. / - Pretend you're a model.

1270
00:42:47,943 --> 00:42:50,443
- That must've been so tough. / - Is this "Extreme Job?"

1271
00:42:50,443 --> 00:42:51,776
"Extreme Manager."

1272
00:42:51,776 --> 00:42:55,143
We talked about it later and he said he enjoyed it.

1273
00:42:56,743 --> 00:42:58,810
Turn around.

1274
00:43:00,243 --> 00:43:02,610
- Turn around. / - He's enjoying it.

1275
00:43:05,443 --> 00:43:07,210
- Gyeonghwan likes stuff like this. / - So cool.

1276
00:43:07,210 --> 00:43:08,843
Take a look. You look really cool.

1277
00:43:08,843 --> 00:43:10,043
Look at this.

1278
00:43:10,043 --> 00:43:12,276
- Gyeonghwan. / - Look here.

1279
00:43:13,443 --> 00:43:15,243
This is what I'm talking about.

1280
00:43:15,243 --> 00:43:17,043
Why am I wearing this?

1281
00:43:17,043 --> 00:43:19,576
- You want to make Yeom Tour famous. / - Right.

1282
00:43:21,443 --> 00:43:24,610
(It's a slow video)

1283
00:43:24,610 --> 00:43:25,843
It's cute.

1284
00:43:25,843 --> 00:43:27,376
Joy and love to you.

1285
00:43:27,376 --> 00:43:30,043
We'll give you a memory that lasts a lifetime.

1286
00:43:31,343 --> 00:43:33,010
Director, please shoot us.

1287
00:43:33,010 --> 00:43:35,776
- Yeom Tour... / - Film us coming from afar.

1288
00:43:35,776 --> 00:43:36,910
- How? / - The three of us...

1289
00:43:36,910 --> 00:43:38,976
Excuse me, but how many photos did you take?

1290
00:43:38,976 --> 00:43:40,510
Around 40,000.

1291
00:43:40,510 --> 00:43:43,243
- The capacity was full. / - It was about 2GB.

1292
00:43:44,876 --> 00:43:47,110
Sunyeong's the only one that looks rich.

1293
00:43:48,310 --> 00:43:49,243
Among them...

1294
00:43:49,243 --> 00:43:50,476
I look like I'm there to buy a building, right?

1295
00:43:50,476 --> 00:43:53,143
We laughed so much later when we saw these.

1296
00:43:53,143 --> 00:43:55,143
This is all that you have left later.

1297
00:43:55,143 --> 00:43:57,743
Yeom Tour's satisfaction is rising.

1298
00:44:01,676 --> 00:44:03,243
It looks cool now that it's night.

1299
00:44:04,110 --> 00:44:09,143
(Just like the old days before we got married)

1300
00:44:09,143 --> 00:44:11,143
Something I'm really proud of...

1301
00:44:11,143 --> 00:44:14,476
When you have kids...

1302
00:44:14,476 --> 00:44:16,910
- You only go to resorts. / - Right.

1303
00:44:16,910 --> 00:44:19,743
Leisure sports, playing in the sand. That's all you do.

1304
00:44:19,743 --> 00:44:21,343
But before I got married,

1305
00:44:21,343 --> 00:44:23,810
I'd hang out like this with friends.

1306
00:44:23,810 --> 00:44:25,343
We'd pack suitcases of clothes.

1307
00:44:25,343 --> 00:44:28,176
We'd do our own photo shoots.

1308
00:44:28,176 --> 00:44:30,943
We'd act all pretty.

1309
00:44:30,943 --> 00:44:32,510
But I'd forgotten all about that.

1310
00:44:32,510 --> 00:44:35,610
You can't go on trips with your girlfriends...

1311
00:44:35,610 --> 00:44:38,543
- When you're our age. / - It's hard to leave the kids.

1312
00:44:39,143 --> 00:44:41,143
I'm the youngest and prettiest today.

1313
00:44:41,143 --> 00:44:43,543
Women age as each day passes.

1314
00:44:43,543 --> 00:44:45,076
I didn't realize.

1315
00:44:45,076 --> 00:44:47,743
When you came with that hairband at first,

1316
00:44:47,743 --> 00:44:49,876
I was a little concerned.

1317
00:44:49,876 --> 00:44:51,610
I was like, "What is he doing?"

1318
00:44:51,610 --> 00:44:54,143
"Is he going to make us get foot massages?"

1319
00:44:54,143 --> 00:44:55,943
- Doing things other people always do. / - Yeah.

1320
00:44:55,943 --> 00:44:58,843
I was so worried that we'd do all the obvious stuff.

1321
00:44:58,843 --> 00:45:01,143
These aren't places that you can look up with ease.

1322
00:45:01,143 --> 00:45:03,976
You actually went out of your way to find them.

1323
00:45:03,976 --> 00:45:05,810
I was so thankful for that.

1324
00:45:05,810 --> 00:45:07,643
You really look like you've been moved.

1325
00:45:07,643 --> 00:45:09,643
That evening breeze was so nice.

1326
00:45:10,143 --> 00:45:12,276
You can't see many Koreans.

1327
00:45:12,276 --> 00:45:13,743
I haven't met one.

1328
00:45:13,743 --> 00:45:16,276
That's why the place I've planned tomorrow is

1329
00:45:16,276 --> 00:45:19,776
a spot where I've never seen Koreans to date.

1330
00:45:19,776 --> 00:45:21,410
Are there more places like that in Hanoi?

1331
00:45:21,410 --> 00:45:24,610
Even the Korean residents don't know about it.

1332
00:45:24,610 --> 00:45:25,476
Really?

1333
00:45:25,476 --> 00:45:28,543
We'll visit there for the day tomorrow.

1334
00:45:28,543 --> 00:45:29,110
Wow.

1335
00:45:29,110 --> 00:45:30,276
Now, we're moving on to the second half.

1336
00:45:30,276 --> 00:45:32,376
Was Hanoi ranked no. 1?

1337
00:45:32,376 --> 00:45:34,076
I'll beat that.

1338
00:45:34,076 --> 00:45:35,343
I'm so nervous.

1339
00:45:35,343 --> 00:45:37,076
Do you even know what we like?

1340
00:45:37,076 --> 00:45:37,810
Of course.

1341
00:45:38,543 --> 00:45:39,710
It's so good.

1342
00:45:40,976 --> 00:45:42,276
(Satisfaction is growing)

1343
00:45:42,276 --> 00:45:44,310
Thank you so much.

1344
00:45:45,076 --> 00:45:46,743
I believe!

1345
00:45:48,043 --> 00:45:49,843
We'll take one more.

1346
00:45:49,843 --> 00:45:52,410
This isn't your ordinary Yeom Tour.

1347
00:45:52,843 --> 00:45:54,143
Hanoi beer.

1348
00:45:54,143 --> 00:45:55,176
(More upgraded service)

1349
00:45:55,943 --> 00:45:57,476
The second half is incredible.

1350
00:45:57,476 --> 00:45:59,043
- The first day was nothing? / - It was nothing.

1351
00:46:00,843 --> 00:46:04,310
The first day was great for friends who are single.

1352
00:46:04,310 --> 00:46:05,976
This time, it's for old ladies.

1353
00:46:05,976 --> 00:46:07,776
What is Vietnamese style sausage stew?

1354
00:46:07,776 --> 00:46:09,376
It tastes good already.

1355
00:46:10,043 --> 00:46:11,543
(Eunkyeong and Sunyeong's hotel)

1356
00:46:11,543 --> 00:46:13,110
It's the next day now.

1357
00:46:13,576 --> 00:46:15,643
He's waiting for them with his safety belt on.

1358
00:46:15,643 --> 00:46:18,110
These ladies are late again.

1359
00:46:19,110 --> 00:46:20,676
Hello.

1360
00:46:21,410 --> 00:46:22,643
Goodness.

1361
00:46:22,643 --> 00:46:24,010
- Look at their clothes. / - Gyeonghwan.

1362
00:46:24,010 --> 00:46:25,943
Ladies, we're hiking a mountain today.

1363
00:46:25,943 --> 00:46:27,710
He's calling her ladies.

1364
00:46:27,710 --> 00:46:29,076
They're going hiking.

1365
00:46:29,076 --> 00:46:31,043
- But you've got sandals on. / - Look at their dress.

1366
00:46:31,943 --> 00:46:33,943
How can you wear sandals?

1367
00:46:33,943 --> 00:46:37,443
We have two pairs of sneakers in here...

1368
00:46:38,976 --> 00:46:40,243
They have so much.

1369
00:46:40,243 --> 00:46:41,343
They are all in here.

1370
00:46:41,343 --> 00:46:43,143
I just packed lightly.

1371
00:46:43,143 --> 00:46:45,076
Two pairs of pants...

1372
00:46:46,943 --> 00:46:49,310
After the hike...

1373
00:46:49,310 --> 00:46:51,510
- We'll have a delicious dinner. / - I know.

1374
00:46:51,510 --> 00:46:53,376
Since you're going to suffer...

1375
00:46:53,376 --> 00:46:55,576
We prepared caffeine. Down it.

1376
00:46:55,576 --> 00:46:57,043
She prepared caffeine?

1377
00:46:57,443 --> 00:46:59,543
He doesn't even have hands left to hold it.

1378
00:47:00,143 --> 00:47:03,143
Anyway, we don't have time so let's get the car.

1379
00:47:06,143 --> 00:47:08,176
- That word means... / - Over here.

1380
00:47:09,343 --> 00:47:11,310
I'll tell you about the car rental.

1381
00:47:11,310 --> 00:47:14,010
For a 7-seater car,

1382
00:47:14,010 --> 00:47:15,210
it's about $90.

1383
00:47:15,210 --> 00:47:17,843
- All day? / - What about the cost of fuel?

1384
00:47:17,843 --> 00:47:19,776
- Includes fuel. / - What?

1385
00:47:19,776 --> 00:47:22,043
- Includes cost for the driver. / - What?

1386
00:47:22,043 --> 00:47:24,443
- It includes parking and everything. / - So cheap.

1387
00:47:24,443 --> 00:47:25,410
It includes everything.

1388
00:47:25,410 --> 00:47:27,976
It includes parking fees and tolls.

1389
00:47:27,976 --> 00:47:29,243
That's incredible.

1390
00:47:29,876 --> 00:47:31,376
Where are we going now?

1391
00:47:31,376 --> 00:47:34,476
Now, we're going to Ninh Binh Province first.

1392
00:47:34,476 --> 00:47:36,143
Think of it like Ha Long Bay.

1393
00:47:36,143 --> 00:47:39,276
Ha Long Bay of the inland.

1394
00:47:39,343 --> 00:47:41,543
(Sunyeong's face is getting darker)

1395
00:47:41,543 --> 00:47:43,943
I've been to Ha Long Bay before.

1396
00:47:43,943 --> 00:47:45,943
It became too popular.

1397
00:47:45,943 --> 00:47:47,943
- I was so shocked. / - You've seen this, right?

1398
00:47:47,943 --> 00:47:49,143
Yes, this is a common site.

1399
00:47:49,643 --> 00:47:51,610
It takes about 3 or 4 hours to get there.

1400
00:47:51,610 --> 00:47:53,243
Ha Long Bay takes about 4 hours.

1401
00:47:53,243 --> 00:47:55,376
But you can tour here in half a day.

1402
00:47:55,376 --> 00:47:56,343
1 hour 40 minutes.

1403
00:47:56,343 --> 00:47:57,676
To tell you about Ninh Binh Province...

1404
00:47:57,676 --> 00:47:59,276
You can go there and back in a day.

1405
00:47:59,276 --> 00:48:00,943
It's the Ha Long Bay of the inland.

1406
00:48:00,943 --> 00:48:02,476
It's the backdrop of "Indochine."

1407
00:48:03,176 --> 00:48:06,310
There aren't many people there so it's really quiet.

1408
00:48:06,310 --> 00:48:07,143
It's really relaxing.

1409
00:48:07,143 --> 00:48:08,276
That's where we went.

1410
00:48:08,276 --> 00:48:11,143
You can feel the magnificent view of Vietnam.

1411
00:48:12,076 --> 00:48:14,043
I didn't see one Korean person there.

1412
00:48:14,043 --> 00:48:15,743
- Not one? / - It's a hidden gem.

1413
00:48:16,143 --> 00:48:17,510
Goodness. What's that?

1414
00:48:17,510 --> 00:48:18,643
That's a cemetery.

1415
00:48:18,643 --> 00:48:20,710
Did they make them look like houses?

1416
00:48:20,710 --> 00:48:21,576
The tombs?

1417
00:48:21,943 --> 00:48:23,043
My goodness.

1418
00:48:23,843 --> 00:48:27,343
(You can wait for the train to pass by)

1419
00:48:29,543 --> 00:48:31,976
(You can see various parts of Vietnam on the way)

1420
00:48:35,276 --> 00:48:36,643
(Gradually, the cars on the road become scarce)

1421
00:48:38,843 --> 00:48:41,076
We'll go to Ninh Binh...

1422
00:48:41,776 --> 00:48:45,043
And do the Galaxy Grotto tour first.

1423
00:48:45,043 --> 00:48:46,343
Galaxy Grotto?

1424
00:48:48,843 --> 00:48:51,143
We'll head in now.

1425
00:48:53,643 --> 00:48:55,176
- What's this? / - What is it?

1426
00:48:55,176 --> 00:48:57,210
The hat.

1427
00:48:57,210 --> 00:49:00,143
Today, the Yeom Tour is different.

1428
00:49:00,143 --> 00:49:02,510
Props like this are so important for photos.

1429
00:49:02,510 --> 00:49:04,310
You really need those.

1430
00:49:04,310 --> 00:49:05,710
Yeom Tour is great.

1431
00:49:06,543 --> 00:49:08,410
Wow, what is this?

1432
00:49:08,410 --> 00:49:09,276
Look at that mountain!

1433
00:49:10,876 --> 00:49:12,010
Are we going to take one of these?

1434
00:49:12,010 --> 00:49:15,410
Yes, we take this and follow this waterway

1435
00:49:15,410 --> 00:49:16,943
and head all the way in there.

1436
00:49:16,943 --> 00:49:18,910
- Really? / - Into that mountain.

1437
00:49:18,910 --> 00:49:20,543
They've already started business even though

1438
00:49:20,543 --> 00:49:22,343
it's only us here.

1439
00:49:22,343 --> 00:49:23,610
I promised you.

1440
00:49:23,610 --> 00:49:27,376
I won't take you to places with lots of tourists.

1441
00:49:27,376 --> 00:49:30,076
- It's really quiet there. / - It was only us.

1442
00:49:30,076 --> 00:49:31,910
With Yeom Tour, we're the only ones.

1443
00:49:32,476 --> 00:49:33,576
Didn't they close down?

1444
00:49:33,576 --> 00:49:35,443
They set that up only because it rained a lot, right?

1445
00:49:35,443 --> 00:49:36,310
No.

1446
00:49:37,843 --> 00:49:39,743
This is so interesting.

1447
00:49:41,143 --> 00:49:42,543
Bye.

1448
00:49:43,276 --> 00:49:45,110
(Heading off on a boat, a dream of all Vietnam trips)

1449
00:49:46,610 --> 00:49:48,543
All I hear is the water.

1450
00:49:48,543 --> 00:49:50,743
- This is so nice. / - This is so nice.

1451
00:49:52,276 --> 00:49:54,143
Over there...

1452
00:49:54,143 --> 00:49:57,343
- That really looks like Guilin. / - Guilin?

1453
00:49:57,776 --> 00:49:59,543
When you go past here, you'll see rice paddies.

1454
00:49:59,543 --> 00:50:01,510
I love rice paddies.

1455
00:50:02,710 --> 00:50:04,476
(Moved)

1456
00:50:06,543 --> 00:50:07,910
It's pretty.

1457
00:50:07,910 --> 00:50:10,676
We're going in between the paddies now.

1458
00:50:11,343 --> 00:50:13,743
There's no one here. Oh, my God.

1459
00:50:13,743 --> 00:50:14,976
This is so awesome.

1460
00:50:15,743 --> 00:50:17,010
It's so beautiful.

1461
00:50:17,010 --> 00:50:19,610
On that boat, only the sound of rowing could be heard.

1462
00:50:19,610 --> 00:50:22,243
There's a special food to enjoy on the boat.

1463
00:50:22,243 --> 00:50:24,676
It's lunch on the water!

1464
00:50:24,676 --> 00:50:27,376
- Yeom Tour is so... / - He just took that out in a hurry.

1465
00:50:27,376 --> 00:50:28,376
It's banh mi!

1466
00:50:28,910 --> 00:50:30,310
- It's banh mi! / - Banh mi.

1467
00:50:30,310 --> 00:50:32,643
Did you hear her voice? "It's banh mi!"

1468
00:50:33,143 --> 00:50:35,276
She was so happy.

1469
00:50:35,276 --> 00:50:37,076
- It's banh mi! / - Banh mi.

1470
00:50:39,443 --> 00:50:41,110
(Before the start of the tour)

1471
00:50:41,110 --> 00:50:43,710
- Four banh mi's please. / - Gyeonghwan is the king.

1472
00:50:43,710 --> 00:50:45,210
He bought that in the morning.

1473
00:50:45,210 --> 00:50:46,810
You won't find a better guide.

1474
00:50:46,810 --> 00:50:48,310
He even bought that banh mi from a famous place

1475
00:50:48,310 --> 00:50:49,410
where people line up to buy.

1476
00:50:49,410 --> 00:50:51,643
Once they make the banh mi,

1477
00:50:51,643 --> 00:50:54,043
they put it in the oven one last time.

1478
00:50:54,043 --> 00:50:55,876
They warm it up once more.

1479
00:50:55,876 --> 00:50:58,643
Their baguettes are made of rice so they taste better.

1480
00:50:58,643 --> 00:51:00,543
- And it's easier to digest too. / - Amazing.

1481
00:51:01,276 --> 00:51:02,443
There's coriander inside.

1482
00:51:02,443 --> 00:51:04,543
- I want a lot of coriander. / - There's a lot.

1483
00:51:05,476 --> 00:51:08,043
Thank you. You're the best.

1484
00:51:09,610 --> 00:51:12,943
And since you're in Hanoi,

1485
00:51:12,943 --> 00:51:14,176
Hanoi beer!

1486
00:51:16,143 --> 00:51:18,210
This guide is too good.

1487
00:51:18,210 --> 00:51:21,143
- Isn't he the best? / - I want to go on the Yeom Tour.

1488
00:51:21,143 --> 00:51:22,076
Me too.

1489
00:51:22,076 --> 00:51:24,976
I can't drink but I want to join in

1490
00:51:26,743 --> 00:51:27,976
- That sound! / - Check it out.

1491
00:51:28,576 --> 00:51:29,810
This sound.

1492
00:51:31,610 --> 00:51:33,476
Oh, my God. I'm so happy.

1493
00:51:37,476 --> 00:51:38,143
So good.

1494
00:51:38,143 --> 00:51:40,276
- Gyeonghwan is so thoughtful. / - I love it.

1495
00:51:40,910 --> 00:51:41,576
Cheers.

1496
00:51:41,576 --> 00:51:44,243
I don't drink beer but I drank some that day.

1497
00:51:45,376 --> 00:51:47,710
(They happily drink beer on the boat)

1498
00:51:48,143 --> 00:51:50,110
When will I ever drink beer

1499
00:51:50,110 --> 00:51:53,543
on a boat on Ninh Binh in Vietnam?

1500
00:51:53,543 --> 00:51:54,743
Thank you so much, Gyeonghwan.

1501
00:51:54,743 --> 00:51:56,210
- Is this okay? / - Yes.

1502
00:51:56,210 --> 00:51:58,443
You look really handsome right now.

1503
00:51:58,443 --> 00:52:00,243
You should look forward to the end of today.

1504
00:52:01,576 --> 00:52:03,143
How much is this banh mi?

1505
00:52:04,076 --> 00:52:06,210
- $1.50. / - $1.50?

1506
00:52:06,210 --> 00:52:09,410
A meal for 4 people costs

1507
00:52:09,410 --> 00:52:10,610
only $6.

1508
00:52:11,143 --> 00:52:13,143
- Make sure you buy some beforehand. / - Amazing.

1509
00:52:13,143 --> 00:52:15,676
- It's the best to eat like that. / - With some beer.

1510
00:52:15,676 --> 00:52:18,343
This place seems frozen in time.

1511
00:52:18,343 --> 00:52:21,910
It's very quiet there. It feels so different.

1512
00:52:21,910 --> 00:52:22,943
Gyeonghwan.

1513
00:52:23,676 --> 00:52:26,310
- My mom would love this. / - Right?

1514
00:52:26,310 --> 00:52:28,376
- Next time... / - Mom loves things like this.

1515
00:52:28,376 --> 00:52:30,843
Let's come with our mothers next time,

1516
00:52:30,843 --> 00:52:32,176
the four of us.

1517
00:52:32,176 --> 00:52:34,476
These places remind you of family.

1518
00:52:35,476 --> 00:52:37,610
So you have to take a boat there?

1519
00:52:38,210 --> 00:52:42,143
At the end of the road is a cave.

1520
00:52:43,176 --> 00:52:45,510
What's interesting is that this road leads to a cave.

1521
00:52:46,443 --> 00:52:48,810
No one would know about this place.

1522
00:52:49,476 --> 00:52:52,043
(Today's weather in Vietnam is as hot as summer)

1523
00:52:55,576 --> 00:52:57,343
We're almost there.

1524
00:52:58,443 --> 00:52:59,943
Please hang in there.

1525
00:53:00,943 --> 00:53:03,310
It doesn't look like there will be a cave here.

1526
00:53:04,910 --> 00:53:07,210
You might not think we're near a cave

1527
00:53:07,210 --> 00:53:10,076
but once we go up here,

1528
00:53:10,076 --> 00:53:11,176
there will be an amazing cave.

1529
00:53:11,910 --> 00:53:14,610
- It's not a winery? / - I thought it was a vineyard too.

1530
00:53:14,610 --> 00:53:18,176
It felt like going to a different world.

1531
00:53:19,243 --> 00:53:21,343
I felt like I was in "Indiana Jones."

1532
00:53:21,343 --> 00:53:23,543
Can you feel the cool wind?

1533
00:53:23,543 --> 00:53:25,576
You can feel the air conditioner breeze, right?

1534
00:53:25,576 --> 00:53:26,510
What is this?

1535
00:53:26,510 --> 00:53:28,376
- My goodness. / - It's so cool.

1536
00:53:28,376 --> 00:53:30,576
What is this? Where are we?

1537
00:53:30,576 --> 00:53:33,110
- Amazing. / - It's so cool.

1538
00:53:33,643 --> 00:53:34,643
Starting from here...

1539
00:53:34,643 --> 00:53:36,710
This is unbelievable. It suddenly dropped 5??

1540
00:53:36,710 --> 00:53:40,243
It must be like the ice valley in Miryang.

1541
00:53:40,243 --> 00:53:42,043
In the cave, you'll be surprised again.

1542
00:53:42,043 --> 00:53:43,810
So take a flashlight.

1543
00:53:43,810 --> 00:53:44,643
Flashlight?

1544
00:53:45,776 --> 00:53:48,376
Follow me. Watch your head.

1545
00:53:49,310 --> 00:53:52,776
- I really like Guide Yeom. / - Me too, I love him.

1546
00:53:56,310 --> 00:53:57,676
Gosh, it's big.

1547
00:53:58,176 --> 00:54:00,476
There are lights here as well.

1548
00:54:00,476 --> 00:54:02,576
The deeper you walk in, the nicer it becomes.

1549
00:54:02,576 --> 00:54:05,610
It looks like a rose. This is like the movie, "Alien."

1550
00:54:05,610 --> 00:54:07,843
- It's like a movie. / - It's like the movie, "Alien."

1551
00:54:07,843 --> 00:54:10,310
- It looks like there could be aliens in there. / - Yeah.

1552
00:54:10,310 --> 00:54:11,776
"Prometheus?"

1553
00:54:11,776 --> 00:54:14,443
I felt like one could film "Star Wars" there.

1554
00:54:14,443 --> 00:54:15,376
Here and there...

1555
00:54:16,410 --> 00:54:17,676
It's really pretty.

1556
00:54:18,476 --> 00:54:20,043
- Water drops. / - There's water.

1557
00:54:20,043 --> 00:54:21,643
It must be really cool in there.

1558
00:54:23,143 --> 00:54:25,143
Once you walk up the staircase,

1559
00:54:25,143 --> 00:54:27,810
stand in the center and look up.

1560
00:54:27,810 --> 00:54:29,143
- He even knew things like that. / - There's something.

1561
00:54:29,143 --> 00:54:31,243
- He's a true guide. / - He was great.

1562
00:54:32,476 --> 00:54:33,576
Oh, my.

1563
00:54:36,043 --> 00:54:36,610
Check it out.

1564
00:54:37,910 --> 00:54:39,176
It's amazing.

1565
00:54:39,176 --> 00:54:40,910
- Is it open? / - It looks incredible.

1566
00:54:40,910 --> 00:54:42,743
- You can even see the sky. / - No joke.

1567
00:54:42,743 --> 00:54:44,410
- My gosh. / - It looks so cool.

1568
00:54:44,410 --> 00:54:47,276
- I feel like I'm in a movie. / - It's amazing, isn't it?

1569
00:54:47,276 --> 00:54:48,576
This reminds me of...

1570
00:54:48,576 --> 00:54:51,176
"The Dark Knight Rises."

1571
00:54:51,176 --> 00:54:54,143
- In the movie... / - The basement...

1572
00:54:54,143 --> 00:54:55,676
Up there...

1573
00:54:57,143 --> 00:54:59,510
Yeom Tour is really captivating.

1574
00:55:00,343 --> 00:55:02,310
You can climb up the stairs?

1575
00:55:02,310 --> 00:55:03,443
Gosh, this is amazing.

1576
00:55:04,076 --> 00:55:06,876
I wonder how they built the stairs here.

1577
00:55:06,876 --> 00:55:09,776
If you come up here...

1578
00:55:12,643 --> 00:55:15,143
There is another space like this.

1579
00:55:18,976 --> 00:55:21,743
It looks so amazing.

1580
00:55:21,743 --> 00:55:24,343
There's the bird-shaped rock.

1581
00:55:24,343 --> 00:55:27,910
I can see it. I see the beak.

1582
00:55:27,910 --> 00:55:29,743
It looks so nice there.

1583
00:55:29,743 --> 00:55:30,510
If you see that in person,

1584
00:55:30,510 --> 00:55:32,143
it's 100 times more touching.

1585
00:55:32,143 --> 00:55:34,276
We'll go deeper into the cave by a boat.

1586
00:55:34,276 --> 00:55:36,043
- There's a boat here? / - There must be a boat.

1587
00:55:36,043 --> 00:55:36,843
Goodness.

1588
00:55:36,843 --> 00:55:40,343
- There are boats in the cave. / - All this costs $6?

1589
00:55:41,176 --> 00:55:43,843
I think Yeom Tour will soon open its business.

1590
00:55:43,843 --> 00:55:46,610
- They must. / - It's like they're making a package.

1591
00:55:47,110 --> 00:55:48,843
- There's no reason not to. / - Amazing.

1592
00:55:50,543 --> 00:55:54,043
- We're now heading to Hang Mua. / - Hang Mua.

1593
00:55:54,043 --> 00:55:57,976
This is where you must visit before you die.

1594
00:55:57,976 --> 00:55:59,976
Yet, it's not very well-known.

1595
00:56:01,076 --> 00:56:03,610
This place looks amazing.

1596
00:56:03,610 --> 00:56:06,976
On the top, you can see a dragon and a pavilion.

1597
00:56:06,976 --> 00:56:07,743
This place looks amazing.

1598
00:56:07,743 --> 00:56:08,576
What's that?

1599
00:56:08,576 --> 00:56:10,010
This place is amazing.

1600
00:56:10,010 --> 00:56:11,910
- It looks a bit similar to the Great Wall. / - Right.

1601
00:56:11,910 --> 00:56:14,710
You'll tear up and think of your family.

1602
00:56:14,710 --> 00:56:16,876
That's the type of view I prepared.

1603
00:56:17,210 --> 00:56:18,476
(The entrance fee is $5)

1604
00:56:19,010 --> 00:56:21,910
You'll go to the top through the stairs here.

1605
00:56:21,910 --> 00:56:23,176
It's actually higher than you think.

1606
00:56:23,176 --> 00:56:26,310
If you're tired on the way, you can take breaks.

1607
00:56:27,443 --> 00:56:28,510
Let's go up.

1608
00:56:29,343 --> 00:56:31,410
It was quite hot that day.

1609
00:56:32,143 --> 00:56:33,843
It's difficult to climb...

1610
00:56:33,843 --> 00:56:35,343
- When it's hot. / - Gyeonghwan nearly collapsed.

1611
00:56:35,343 --> 00:56:38,210
But it gets cooler as you climb.

1612
00:56:38,210 --> 00:56:40,176
There are cool spots.

1613
00:56:40,176 --> 00:56:42,243
Once you reach the top and look at the other side,

1614
00:56:42,243 --> 00:56:44,443
the view there will make you tear up.

1615
00:56:44,443 --> 00:56:45,510
The other side.

1616
00:56:45,510 --> 00:56:47,543
- You must see that. / - Got it.

1617
00:56:47,543 --> 00:56:49,343
Go and see it.

1618
00:56:49,943 --> 00:56:50,810
Gyeonghwan.

1619
00:56:51,276 --> 00:56:53,043
That's where he stopped.

1620
00:56:53,043 --> 00:56:55,843
- We must go. / - Gyeonghwan is suffering the most.

1621
00:56:55,843 --> 00:56:58,543
We work out every day so...

1622
00:56:58,543 --> 00:57:01,643
We loved being able to burn the calories.

1623
00:57:03,443 --> 00:57:04,976
Sweating makes me feel good.

1624
00:57:07,610 --> 00:57:09,876
It's like Gyeonghwan is aging rapidly.

1625
00:57:10,343 --> 00:57:11,010
He seems so.

1626
00:57:11,010 --> 00:57:11,943
Look, there...

1627
00:57:11,943 --> 00:57:13,776
- It's a kiosk. / - There's an observatory here.

1628
00:57:15,310 --> 00:57:16,810
There's a kiosk on the way.

1629
00:57:16,810 --> 00:57:18,443
It's a cute kiosk. They were selling coconuts.

1630
00:57:19,276 --> 00:57:21,410
Why did I follow them?

1631
00:57:22,676 --> 00:57:25,076
I'm tired.

1632
00:57:25,643 --> 00:57:27,176
I don't see Gyeonghwan.

1633
00:57:27,643 --> 00:57:28,610
Gyeonghwan.

1634
00:57:29,510 --> 00:57:30,443
Gyeonghwan.

1635
00:57:30,443 --> 00:57:31,543
He can't go further.

1636
00:57:32,576 --> 00:57:34,676
Please go ahead, ladies.

1637
00:57:34,676 --> 00:57:35,810
Ladies?

1638
00:57:37,610 --> 00:57:38,610
So cute.

1639
00:57:40,510 --> 00:57:41,710
This is a great workout.

1640
00:57:41,710 --> 00:57:43,410
- Look at the stairs. / - It looks very nice.

1641
00:57:43,943 --> 00:57:45,976
The higher you climb, the more beautiful the view?

1642
00:57:47,376 --> 00:57:49,543
Since you can see farther.

1643
00:57:51,643 --> 00:57:53,076
People are waiting in line to take pictures.

1644
00:57:55,410 --> 00:57:57,776
(Without taking any break, they keep going)

1645
00:57:59,310 --> 00:58:02,043
(They don't stop climbing)

1646
00:58:04,376 --> 00:58:07,343
I'm so exhausted.

1647
00:58:08,243 --> 00:58:09,710
Gosh, this is tough.

1648
00:58:13,410 --> 00:58:15,410
- You'll soon see an interesting thing. / - Are we there?

1649
00:58:15,410 --> 00:58:16,376
There's another interesting thing?

1650
00:58:16,376 --> 00:58:17,243
It isn't over.

1651
00:58:17,243 --> 00:58:19,076
They're doing their wedding shoot here.

1652
00:58:19,076 --> 00:58:20,243
Here!

1653
00:58:20,243 --> 00:58:21,710
She was doing her wedding shoot.

1654
00:58:21,710 --> 00:58:24,110
In the boiling weather, wearing heels...

1655
00:58:24,110 --> 00:58:26,476
Unbelievable.

1656
00:58:26,976 --> 00:58:29,410
Unbelievable wedding.

1657
00:58:29,410 --> 00:58:30,576
They really love each other.

1658
00:58:30,576 --> 00:58:33,143
She wore that dress up the mountain.

1659
00:58:33,143 --> 00:58:35,110
She wore that dress up the mountain.

1660
00:58:35,110 --> 00:58:37,543
- Up to there. / - She beat us.

1661
00:58:37,543 --> 00:58:38,776
Unbelievable.

1662
00:58:38,776 --> 00:58:40,643
- They're amazing. / - True winners.

1663
00:58:40,643 --> 00:58:42,210
Congratulation!

1664
00:58:45,710 --> 00:58:47,710
(Meanwhile, what's Gyeonghwan up to?)

1665
00:58:49,276 --> 00:58:51,310
Even the little kid went up.

1666
00:58:52,010 --> 00:58:52,910
Gosh, this is embarrassing.

1667
00:58:55,943 --> 00:58:57,210
I feel like death.

1668
00:59:02,010 --> 00:59:04,110
I can do it.

1669
00:59:04,110 --> 00:59:05,843
Let's go.

1670
00:59:09,543 --> 00:59:11,043
Amazing.

1671
00:59:11,510 --> 00:59:14,110
The view from up there must be beautiful.

1672
00:59:14,110 --> 00:59:15,910
It's so nice here.

1673
00:59:15,910 --> 00:59:16,810
I got teary.

1674
00:59:17,843 --> 00:59:18,643
Seriously.

1675
00:59:19,343 --> 00:59:20,910
- There's a dragon. / - Where?

1676
00:59:20,910 --> 00:59:21,843
Over there.

1677
00:59:22,743 --> 00:59:23,543
Where is the dragon?

1678
00:59:28,976 --> 00:59:30,343
- It's huge. / - It is.

1679
00:59:30,576 --> 00:59:31,810
It looks awesome.

1680
00:59:34,543 --> 00:59:37,410
1, 2, 3.

1681
00:59:39,243 --> 00:59:42,176
- Is Gyeonghwan still not there yet? / - He couldn't.

1682
00:59:44,710 --> 00:59:48,443
He's doing a photo shoot with that person.

1683
00:59:49,210 --> 00:59:50,110
Are you kidding?

1684
00:59:54,443 --> 00:59:56,476
(Embarrassed)

1685
00:59:57,310 --> 00:59:59,443
It's tough even when you're dressed like this.

1686
00:59:59,443 --> 01:00:01,610
How did she climb up here with a wedding dress on?

1687
01:00:02,710 --> 01:00:03,910
She's amazing.

1688
01:00:03,910 --> 01:00:06,343
My goodness. Aren't you tired?

1689
01:00:06,876 --> 01:00:08,643
Gosh, you're amazing.

1690
01:00:10,110 --> 01:00:12,910
(He's finally near the peak)

1691
01:00:15,743 --> 01:00:17,043
Excuse me.

1692
01:00:17,043 --> 01:00:19,010
Dad, dad.

1693
01:00:20,076 --> 01:00:21,376
Did you drop by somewhere?

1694
01:00:21,743 --> 01:00:23,410
- I've been climbing the whole time. / - Close-up.

1695
01:00:23,410 --> 01:00:24,343
Close-up first.

1696
01:00:26,610 --> 01:00:28,643
(Eunkyeong's close-up pictures)

1697
01:00:28,643 --> 01:00:29,976
- There's your profile picture. / - You should work out.

1698
01:00:29,976 --> 01:00:31,143
- Mothers are always on the run so... / -  Gyeonghwan...

1699
01:00:31,143 --> 01:00:32,843
The view from this side is amazing.

1700
01:00:32,843 --> 01:00:34,310
Is this what you meant earlier?

1701
01:00:34,310 --> 01:00:35,876
It's amazing.

1702
01:00:35,876 --> 01:00:37,410
What is that?

1703
01:00:37,410 --> 01:00:40,343
This canal is connected to Trang An.

1704
01:00:40,343 --> 01:00:41,543
Try to...

1705
01:00:42,143 --> 01:00:45,643
Stand here and think about nothing for 10 minutes.

1706
01:00:45,643 --> 01:00:47,776
It'll be an unforgettable memory.

1707
01:00:51,010 --> 01:00:52,410
It looks like a painting, isn't it?

1708
01:00:53,476 --> 01:00:54,576
It's so beautiful.

1709
01:00:54,576 --> 01:00:57,143
- It's a beautiful place. / - This is amazing.

1710
01:00:57,143 --> 01:00:59,276
The view is incredible.

1711
01:00:59,276 --> 01:01:00,910
I'm going to send these pictures home.

1712
01:01:02,910 --> 01:01:04,943
(They want to share this view with their families)

1713
01:01:04,943 --> 01:01:07,743
Being up there reminded me of my family.

1714
01:01:07,743 --> 01:01:10,176
I took pictures of the view and sent them to my family.

1715
01:01:11,543 --> 01:01:14,043
- We've been working hard. / - We have.

1716
01:01:14,043 --> 01:01:17,143
We should work harder when we go back.

1717
01:01:18,676 --> 01:01:21,010
Let's work hard.

1718
01:01:21,010 --> 01:01:22,710
Are we going to eat now?

1719
01:01:22,710 --> 01:01:24,443
We'll go back to Hanoi

1720
01:01:24,443 --> 01:01:26,043
since a day trip is possible.

1721
01:01:26,043 --> 01:01:28,310
Our driver drove us back to Hanoi

1722
01:01:28,310 --> 01:01:29,543
with the rental car.

1723
01:01:30,610 --> 01:01:32,376
What is that? It's so shiny.

1724
01:01:32,376 --> 01:01:33,976
This is a great restaurant in Hanoi

1725
01:01:33,976 --> 01:01:36,043
that I want to introduce to everyone.

1726
01:01:36,043 --> 01:01:39,110
I have never seen any Koreans here ever.

1727
01:01:40,143 --> 01:01:43,043
Today, on Battle Trip...

1728
01:01:43,043 --> 01:01:44,076
Is it the first time revealing it?

1729
01:01:44,076 --> 01:01:45,710
This is the hidden card.

1730
01:01:46,443 --> 01:01:48,710
Vietnam style sausage stew.

1731
01:01:49,243 --> 01:01:50,143
What is this?

1732
01:01:50,143 --> 01:01:51,376
- Oh, my. / - Really?

1733
01:01:51,376 --> 01:01:53,343
- "Lau." / - "Lau."

1734
01:01:53,343 --> 01:01:54,976
They add noodles at the end.

1735
01:01:54,976 --> 01:01:58,243
- What is that? / - I come here often with family.

1736
01:01:58,243 --> 01:01:59,743
Even the kids like this.

1737
01:01:59,743 --> 01:02:01,476
It's a good place to bring the whole family.

1738
01:02:01,476 --> 01:02:02,976
I really want to eat this.

1739
01:02:02,976 --> 01:02:04,276
It's not ordinary noodles.

1740
01:02:04,276 --> 01:02:07,410
We wouldn't have known this if it wasn't for Yeom Tour.

1741
01:02:07,410 --> 01:02:10,943
- Isn't the atmosphere amazing here? / - I love it.

1742
01:02:11,976 --> 01:02:13,543
(Gyeonghwan says hello to someone)

1743
01:02:14,310 --> 01:02:15,710
They must be friends.

1744
01:02:16,410 --> 01:02:18,376
- I come here often. / - Really?

1745
01:02:20,810 --> 01:02:22,876
(Gyeonghwan orders the food)

1746
01:02:22,876 --> 01:02:24,010
That burner is so interesting.

1747
01:02:24,010 --> 01:02:25,276
Oh, they put two together.

1748
01:02:25,276 --> 01:02:26,910
(We'll have the usual)

1749
01:02:26,910 --> 01:02:28,176
It's delicious.

1750
01:02:28,176 --> 01:02:29,710
It's here.

1751
01:02:30,110 --> 01:02:31,710
It's here.

1752
01:02:33,776 --> 01:02:34,710
This is amazing.

1753
01:02:34,710 --> 01:02:37,343
- It's lau. / - It's lau.

1754
01:02:37,510 --> 01:02:39,576
- It's lau. / - I'm so proud.

1755
01:02:40,510 --> 01:02:42,310
These are just the basic ingredients.

1756
01:02:43,510 --> 01:02:46,610
These are mushrooms and meat sausages.

1757
01:02:46,610 --> 01:02:49,443
Like Sikyung says, it looks good as is.

1758
01:02:49,443 --> 01:02:51,976
- Just. / - It has every tasty ingredient.

1759
01:02:51,976 --> 01:02:53,543
It has squids, shrimps and clams.

1760
01:02:53,543 --> 01:02:54,843
- What is the soup made of? / - Fish.

1761
01:02:54,843 --> 01:02:56,910
They usually just make the soup

1762
01:02:56,910 --> 01:02:58,443
by themselves with herbs.

1763
01:02:58,443 --> 01:03:01,410
For 5 people, it only costs about $35.

1764
01:03:01,410 --> 01:03:02,910
This place is amazing.

1765
01:03:02,910 --> 01:03:05,476
- Just put everything in. / - Everything?

1766
01:03:05,476 --> 01:03:06,610
- Tofu. / - Everything.

1767
01:03:06,610 --> 01:03:08,010
Everything is healthy.

1768
01:03:08,576 --> 01:03:10,476
It's starting to boil.

1769
01:03:11,310 --> 01:03:14,110
- Let's put the vegetables. / - We really like this.

1770
01:03:14,110 --> 01:03:17,576
- Let's put this much in. / - All you can eat.

1771
01:03:17,576 --> 01:03:19,443
nfvlf

1772
01:03:19,443 --> 01:03:21,210
You can keep asking for vegetables.

1773
01:03:21,210 --> 01:03:22,943
Look at this. This is amazing.

1774
01:03:22,943 --> 01:03:25,343
It looks like me. Why is it so long?

1775
01:03:25,343 --> 01:03:27,443
- Let's just put a few in. / - I want that one.

1776
01:03:28,010 --> 01:03:29,610
This is fried tofu paper.

1777
01:03:29,610 --> 01:03:32,010
I think I ate about 40 pieces of the fried tofu.

1778
01:03:32,010 --> 01:03:33,876
- That's really delicious. / - To make it spicy...

1779
01:03:33,876 --> 01:03:36,176
- Put this in. / - I need to buy that.

1780
01:03:36,176 --> 01:03:37,276
- Put this in. / - I'm going to take one with me.

1781

01:03:44,676 --> 01:03:46,810
- Let's make it really spicy. / - I love it.

1785
01:03:46,810 --> 01:03:49,643
This looks really good.

1786
01:03:49,643 --> 01:03:51,043
I'll make the sauce.

1787
01:03:51,043 --> 01:03:52,176
Squeeze some lime.

1788
01:03:52,176 --> 01:03:55,843
And put the chili peppers in.

1789
01:03:55,843 --> 01:03:57,976
- Where did you dip it? / - Right there.

1790
01:04:00,476 --> 01:04:01,676
It's so good.

1791
01:04:06,810 --> 01:04:08,776
- Dip it in the sauce. / - That looks so good.

1792
01:04:08,776 --> 01:04:10,276
What is delicious in Vietnamese?

1793
01:04:10,710 --> 01:04:13,910
nn

1794
01:04:16,443 --> 01:04:17,710
It tastes so clean.

1795
01:04:17,710 --> 01:04:19,676

1796
01:04:19,676 --> 01:04:21,176

01:04:21,176 --> 01:04:23,443
It just looks good.

1798
01:04:29,110 --> 01:04:31,110
(She taste the fried tofu paper)

1799
01:04:31,110 --> 01:04:32,643
Eat the small one.

1800
01:04:34,810 --> 01:04:36,176
It's like fried tofu.

1801
01:04:36,176 --> 01:04:39,476
Because it soaks in the soup, it tastes like dried fish.

1802
01:04:39,476 --> 01:04:41,243
- It's soaked in the soup. / - That's right.

1803
01:04:41,243 --> 01:04:42,810
You can get more vegetables for free.

1804
01:04:43,676 --> 01:04:46,643
- More vegetables for free. / - Vegetables are expensive.

1805
01:04:46,643 --> 01:04:48,576
- It's really cost-effective. / - Yes.

1806
01:04:48,576 --> 01:04:50,843
I really need to go there to meet Gyeonghwan.

1807
01:04:51,476 --> 01:04:54,543
They add noodles later, right?

1808
01:04:54,543 --> 01:04:56,110
It's fantastic.

1809
01:04:56,110 --> 01:04:57,843
- It's here. / - Is this the noodles?

1810
01:04:57,843 --> 01:04:58,643
Why is it so cute?

1811
01:04:58,643 --> 01:04:59,410
Noodles?

1812
01:04:59,410 --> 01:05:00,676
- Noodles. / - What's this?

1813
01:05:00,676 --> 01:05:03,376
The noodles are good even if you eat it plain.

1814
01:05:04,143 --> 01:05:05,543
It was so delicious.

1815
01:05:05,543 --> 01:05:06,843
Put it in.

1816
01:05:06,843 --> 01:05:08,010
- It's so adorable. / - It's floating.

1817
01:05:08,010 --> 01:05:09,443
- Let me try the plain noodles. / - The plain noodles.

1818
01:05:09,443 --> 01:05:12,043
The noodles are really thin. Try it.

1819
01:05:13,843 --> 01:05:14,610
(Crunch)

1820
01:05:14,610 --> 01:05:18,143
We have to put noodles in this kind of soup.

1821
01:05:18,643 --> 01:05:20,676
This is that thing.

1822
01:05:20,676 --> 01:05:23,443
It's the ramen snack my son eats.

1823
01:05:23,443 --> 01:05:25,410
- That taste. / - It was so good.

1824
01:05:25,410 --> 01:05:27,143
I bought a box of it.

1825
01:05:27,643 --> 01:05:28,743
Didn't you bring it today?

1826
01:05:28,743 --> 01:05:30,876
- I ate all of it. / - I'll send you some.

1827
01:05:30,876 --> 01:05:32,810
They have different flavors. Shrimp, beef...

1828
01:05:32,810 --> 01:05:35,176
- Chicken. They have a variety. / - I want it all.

1829
01:05:35,176 --> 01:05:36,310
The shrimp flavor was the best.

1830
01:05:36,310 --> 01:05:38,243
- Highly recommend it. / - Shrimp flavor.

1831
01:05:38,876 --> 01:05:41,043
I don't think you'll gain weight with these noodles.

1832
01:05:42,310 --> 01:05:44,310
(It's zero calories if it's delicious)

1833
01:05:49,376 --> 01:05:51,676
(Slurping)

1834
01:05:52,243 --> 01:05:54,476
I really need to drink the soup.

1835
01:05:56,276 --> 01:05:58,776
(The spicy soup relieves upset stomachs)

1836
01:05:58,776 --> 01:06:01,010
I can't help it.

1837
01:06:01,010 --> 01:06:02,776
Since we're in Hanoi,

1838
01:06:02,776 --> 01:06:04,343
we need to try Hanoi vodka.

1839
01:06:04,343 --> 01:06:05,943
That's amazing. You need to remember this.

1840
01:06:05,943 --> 01:06:08,210
- What is that? / - It's the Hanoi local vodka.

1841
01:06:08,210 --> 01:06:09,910
Try some Hanoi vodka.

1842
01:06:09,910 --> 01:06:12,110
Is it okay for you to drink today?

1843
01:06:12,110 --> 01:06:13,843
- Did you video call your family? / - Yes.

1844
01:06:13,843 --> 01:06:14,943
The kids are all sleeping.

1845
01:06:14,943 --> 01:06:16,510
- Can I give you a drink now? / - Yes.

1846
01:06:16,510 --> 01:06:17,843
Okay.

1847
01:06:17,843 --> 01:06:19,376
First...

1848
01:06:21,710 --> 01:06:23,076
I can't drink alcohol

1849
01:06:23,076 --> 01:06:25,210
but he made such a delicious drink.

1850
01:06:25,210 --> 01:06:27,776
- It's cider. / - I was so surprised.

1851
01:06:29,643 --> 01:06:32,110
Yeom's cocktail.

1852
01:06:32,110 --> 01:06:35,210
Here, it's really cool. Take this.

1853
01:06:35,210 --> 01:06:36,210
Put a lime in there.

1854
01:06:36,210 --> 01:06:39,043
- Oh, my. / - It looks so good.

1855
01:06:39,676 --> 01:06:40,943
- That's amazing. / - You have to put a lot in it.

1856
01:06:40,943 --> 01:06:43,943
It's so nice that a local is making that for you.

1857
01:06:43,943 --> 01:06:46,110
The locals drink like that.

1858
01:06:46,110 --> 01:06:47,310
I love this.

1859
01:06:47,310 --> 01:06:49,410
You did a good job going up the mountain.

1860
01:06:49,410 --> 01:06:52,243
Let's end today with this.

1861
01:06:52,243 --> 01:06:53,943
- Cheers. / - 1, 2, 3.

1862
01:06:57,010 --> 01:06:59,510
1, 2, 3.

1863
01:07:02,110 --> 01:07:03,410
- It's so good. / - It's really good.

1864
01:07:04,043 --> 01:07:06,710
- It's so good. It's not the time to take photos. / - Try it.

1865
01:07:09,843 --> 01:07:11,710
How is it?

1866
01:07:11,710 --> 01:07:13,843
- I thought you couldn't drink alcohol? / - It's so good.

1867
01:07:14,476 --> 01:07:16,576
- Please don't over drink. / - That looks so delicious.

1868
01:07:16,576 --> 01:07:18,043
Your little finger goes up when something's good.

1869
01:07:18,043 --> 01:07:19,443
It makes you like this.

1870
01:07:19,443 --> 01:07:21,076
Who gave me sugar water?

1871
01:07:21,076 --> 01:07:22,610
I put vodka in it.

1872
01:07:23,143 --> 01:07:25,110
- Are you okay with another drink? / - Yes.

1873
01:07:26,676 --> 01:07:29,876
I did a food show for 5 years.

1874
01:07:29,876 --> 01:07:33,543
One of the best was noodles made

1875
01:07:33,543 --> 01:07:35,876
from freshly caught crab from Yeongdeok.

1876
01:07:35,876 --> 01:07:37,043
This beats that.

1877
01:07:37,043 --> 01:07:38,443
It's the best.

1878
01:07:39,776 --> 01:07:41,343
Vietnam is too good.

1879
01:07:41,343 --> 01:07:43,776
The votes might be the highest ever.

1880
01:07:43,776 --> 01:07:45,210
- Isn't it amazing? / - Yes.

1881
01:07:45,210 --> 01:07:47,810
I prepared something else tomorrow.

1882
01:07:47,810 --> 01:07:49,710
I prepared something else tomorrow.

1883
01:07:50,710 --> 01:07:52,043
(The next day, there were only 4 hours left)

1884
01:07:52,310 --> 01:07:53,710
(Until the plane departed)

1885
01:07:53,710 --> 01:07:55,476
- What is that? / - Till the end.

1886
01:07:55,476 --> 01:07:57,376
We went there for a short time but it was packed.

1887
01:07:59,510 --> 01:08:00,543
Ta-da.

1888
01:08:02,110 --> 01:08:06,543
This is the last day today.

1889
01:08:06,543 --> 01:08:08,876
I prepared something meaningful.

1890
01:08:09,810 --> 01:08:11,576
- Should we go inside? / - It's a restaurant.

1891
01:08:11,576 --> 01:08:12,710
Where are they going?

1892
01:08:13,743 --> 01:08:16,210
(Is the last course a restaurant?)

1893
01:08:17,376 --> 01:08:20,043
(Where did he confidently lead the mothers to?)

1894
01:08:20,343 --> 01:08:21,610
The building is big.

1895
01:08:21,610 --> 01:08:23,910
- The building is endless. / - It's connected.

1896
01:08:23,910 --> 01:08:25,810
It connects to the next building.

1897
01:08:27,410 --> 01:08:29,176
- Ta-da. / - It's a cooking class.

1898
01:08:30,476 --> 01:08:33,176
We completed our bucket list.

1899
01:08:34,143 --> 01:08:36,676
We didn't know that he would complete the entire list.

1900
01:08:36,676 --> 01:08:40,376
- Are you ready? / - We're ready.

1901
01:08:41,343 --> 01:08:44,176
Today, we will cook banh xeo.

1902
01:08:44,610 --> 01:08:46,243
You've heard of banh xeo, right?

1903
01:08:46,243 --> 01:08:47,976
It's like a pancake.

1904
01:08:47,976 --> 01:08:50,510
It's kind of like a wrap.

1905
01:08:50,510 --> 01:08:53,176
It's like a Korean fritters.

1906
01:08:53,176 --> 01:08:55,676
We're going to make it ourselves and eat it.

1907
01:08:55,676 --> 01:08:56,976
That looks really good.

1908
01:08:56,976 --> 01:08:58,443
It's perfect with beer.

1909
01:09:00,443 --> 01:09:01,810
Bean sprouts,

1910
01:09:01,810 --> 01:09:04,243
chives, and onions.

1911
01:09:04,243 --> 01:09:07,343
- It looks like mushrooms. / - We have all this in Korea.

1912
01:09:08,676 --> 01:09:09,443
Mung beans.

1913
01:09:14,410 --> 01:09:18,343
- They sell banh xeo powder. / - It's like pancake mix.

1914
01:09:18,343 --> 01:09:20,010
Let's buy this.

1915
01:09:21,676 --> 01:09:23,043
Inside...

1916
01:09:24,476 --> 01:09:25,476
We have to take this out.

1917
01:09:25,476 --> 01:09:29,676
- It's turmeric. / - It's a spice powder.

1918
01:09:29,676 --> 01:09:30,943
You don't have to buy it separately.

1919
01:09:31,810 --> 01:09:33,510
It's convenient with that powder.

1920
01:09:34,410 --> 01:09:35,776
It's for three people.

1921
01:09:38,010 --> 01:09:40,310
- 1, 2, 3. / - 1, 2, 3.

1922
01:09:41,910 --> 01:09:45,143
(Add half of the turmeric powder)

1923
01:09:47,210 --> 01:09:49,810
(Add 3 spoons of coconut milk)

1924
01:09:49,810 --> 01:09:51,210
Okay.

1925
01:09:51,976 --> 01:09:53,476
- Add water. / - Water.

1926
01:09:56,176 --> 01:09:57,876
(Mixing)

1927
01:09:58,443 --> 01:10:01,543
Salt? Okay, add some salt.

1928
01:10:02,476 --> 01:10:06,143
- You sieve it. / - Yes, we have to sieve it.

1929
01:10:07,176 --> 01:10:08,643
Banh xeo.

1930
01:10:08,876 --> 01:10:10,576
It's clean now. Look at the bottom.

1931
01:10:11,910 --> 01:10:14,643
- It's so pretty. / - It's smooth now.

1932
01:10:14,643 --> 01:10:15,443
Look at this.

1933
01:10:19,343 --> 01:10:20,576
- Let is rise. / - Rise.

1934
01:10:20,576 --> 01:10:22,210
Rise for 10 minutes.

1935
01:10:23,010 --> 01:10:25,476
(They are preparing the other ingredients)

1936
01:10:25,910 --> 01:10:28,310
- We do this for glass noodles. / - Right.

1937
01:10:30,743 --> 01:10:33,410
(Take the shell off the shrimps in the middle)

1938
01:10:34,276 --> 01:10:38,076
(Make little cuts in the body)

1939
01:10:38,643 --> 01:10:40,576
Oh, this...

1940
01:10:40,576 --> 01:10:42,276
She looks like a chef.

1941
01:10:43,376 --> 01:10:45,176
- It's looking good now. / - Isn't the color so pretty?

1942
01:10:46,376 --> 01:10:47,643
Oh, my God.

1943
01:10:50,043 --> 01:10:51,210
Okay.

1944
01:10:51,210 --> 01:10:52,176
This is important.

1945
01:10:52,176 --> 01:10:53,276
The paste.

1946
01:10:54,643 --> 01:10:57,143
(The paste is thicker than water after 10 minutes)

1947
01:10:59,443 --> 01:11:01,543
He uses a lot of oil.

1948
01:11:02,343 --> 01:11:03,443
Heat the oil first.

1949
01:11:04,310 --> 01:11:06,810
It's like deep frying.

1950
01:11:06,810 --> 01:11:09,143
He's throwing it out.

1951
01:11:10,743 --> 01:11:11,476
I see.

1952
01:11:11,476 --> 01:11:13,843
He covered the pan completely with oil.

1953
01:11:16,076 --> 01:11:18,576
It was so fun and memorable.

1954
01:11:19,143 --> 01:11:22,510
(Pour the paste in the hot pan)

1955
01:11:28,010 --> 01:11:29,610
Put the onions in.

1956
01:11:29,610 --> 01:11:33,343
(Add toppings)

1957
01:11:33,343 --> 01:11:36,176
- That looks good. / - There are a lot of ingredients.

1958
01:11:36,176 --> 01:11:37,976
- I'm generous. / - It's like an Asian taco.

1959
01:11:37,976 --> 01:11:39,243
It's like Korean fritters.

1960
01:11:39,243 --> 01:11:42,076
- Like a seafood fritters. / - Right.

1961
01:11:43,376 --> 01:11:46,376
(Banh xeo with love)

1962
01:11:47,243 --> 01:11:49,143
Let's go to a nice place

1963
01:11:49,143 --> 01:11:50,976
to taste the dish we made.

1964
01:11:51,610 --> 01:11:54,876
- That's so simple. / - That was a famous restaurant.

1965
01:11:54,876 --> 01:11:57,876
They set the table so we can enjoy the dish there.

1966
01:11:57,876 --> 01:11:59,876
It's part of the cooking class.

1967
01:12:01,543 --> 01:12:02,976
Please come in.

1968
01:12:02,976 --> 01:12:04,676
You get to eat good food...

1969
01:12:06,076 --> 01:12:07,810
- Check out the table. / - This feels awesome.

1970
01:12:07,810 --> 01:12:09,610
We dressed up to the end.

1971
01:12:09,610 --> 01:12:11,910
- Are they the dishes we made? / - Amazing.

1972
01:12:11,910 --> 01:12:15,210
- It's all decorated... / - This restaurant is so nice.

1973
01:12:15,210 --> 01:12:16,410
So we made this?

1974
01:12:16,410 --> 01:12:18,510
Can we cook these dishes here?

1975
01:12:18,510 --> 01:12:20,243
You can cook all these dishes.

1976
01:12:20,243 --> 01:12:21,843
- It looks amazing. / - But we only made banh xeo...

1977
01:12:21,843 --> 01:12:23,610
- To save time. / - So good.

1978
01:12:23,610 --> 01:12:27,176
You can choose three dishes and make them,

1979
01:12:27,176 --> 01:12:28,210
which costs $55.

1980
01:12:28,210 --> 01:12:32,243
Let's try banh xeo that you made first.

1981
01:12:32,243 --> 01:12:34,843
- There are two kinds... / - It's like pizza.

1982
01:12:34,843 --> 01:12:36,576
Of banh xeo.

1983
01:12:36,576 --> 01:12:39,243
There's one folded in half.

1984
01:12:39,243 --> 01:12:40,876
- That one's common. / - This is the other kind.

1985
01:12:40,876 --> 01:12:42,410
But this is what we made.

1986
01:12:42,410 --> 01:12:44,343
Cut it and

1987
01:12:44,343 --> 01:12:46,476
wrap it with rice paper.

1988
01:12:46,476 --> 01:12:48,843
- That's unique. Watch carefully. / - Isn't it unique?

1989
01:12:48,843 --> 01:12:51,010
- Put it on your plate. / - He didn't dip in water.

1990
01:12:51,010 --> 01:12:51,843
Without water.

1991
01:12:51,843 --> 01:12:53,643
That's the rice paper you eat without wetting them.

1992
01:12:53,643 --> 01:12:57,576
- Put a piece of banh xeo on it. / - Add this...

1993
01:12:57,576 --> 01:13:01,376
- A few slices of pineapple. / - I'll add some peppers.

1994
01:13:01,376 --> 01:13:03,743
- Cucumber. / - I like chili peppers.

1995
01:13:03,743 --> 01:13:07,476
Then roll it.

1996
01:13:07,476 --> 01:13:09,710
It's not like the wet spring rolls

1997
01:13:09,710 --> 01:13:11,243
we usually eat at a Vietnamese restaurant.

1998
01:13:11,243 --> 01:13:13,176
- See? It's very crispy. / - It does look crispy.

1999
01:13:13,176 --> 01:13:14,943

2002
01:13:22,543 --> 01:13:25,010
Oh, no. I'm in a hurry.

2003
01:13:25,010 --> 01:13:26,876
- What do I do? / - Give me some scissors.

2004
01:13:26,876 --> 01:13:29,010
- Hello? / - I'm in such a hurry.

2005
01:13:29,010 --> 01:13:30,043
It's so good.

2006
01:13:31,210 --> 01:13:33,943
- Then this... / - Add this...

2007
01:13:33,943 --> 01:13:35,176
Shrimp on top.

2008
01:13:35,176 --> 01:13:38,343
- You're chefs already. / - Wrap it up.

2009
01:13:38,343 --> 01:13:39,976
- Oh, dear. / - Oh, dear.

2010
01:13:39,976 --> 01:13:42,143
- Don't be so greedy. / - It looks nice, doesn't it?

2011
01:13:42,143 --> 01:13:44,543
You know I'm a modest woman.

2012
01:13:45,443 --> 01:13:47,743
(Modest women eat in one bite)

2013
01:13:47,876 --> 01:13:49,876
- Sunyeong is being greedy. / - I look modest, right?

2014
01:13:49,876 --> 01:13:51,176
Are you fighting with the food?

2015
01:13:53,143 --> 01:13:55,176
- Is it good? / - It's so delicious.

2016
01:13:55,176 --> 01:13:56,176
What should I do?

2017
01:13:56,876 --> 01:13:59,776
It's amazing. You'll be surprised.

2018
01:13:59,776 --> 01:14:00,943
It's unbelievable.

2019
01:14:02,210 --> 01:14:04,143
Roll it up.

2020
01:14:04,143 --> 01:14:06,943
That's right. She's doing a good job.

2021
01:14:09,110 --> 01:14:10,543
That's right.

2022
01:14:11,543 --> 01:14:13,676
It's nothing like our fritters.

2023
01:14:13,676 --> 01:14:17,476
It's between scorched rice

2024
01:14:17,476 --> 01:14:21,576
and a crispy thin pizza.

2025
01:14:22,943 --> 01:14:25,143
- It's hard to watch. / - Right?

2026
01:14:25,143 --> 01:14:26,510
It was really good.

2027
01:14:30,210 --> 01:14:32,176
- You can cook it now, right? / - Yes.

2028
01:14:32,176 --> 01:14:34,010
- I'll definitely try this at home. / - That looks so good.

2029
01:14:35,176 --> 01:14:37,710
I'll cook banh xeo every day.

2030
01:14:38,710 --> 01:14:41,243
Let's finish this and go to a market

2031
01:14:41,243 --> 01:14:42,810
to buy the ingredients.

2032
01:14:42,810 --> 01:14:44,176
- We bought all the ingredients. / - Banh xeo ingredients.

2033
01:14:44,176 --> 01:14:45,410
We bought all the ingredients there.

2034
01:14:45,410 --> 01:14:46,510
Did you buy all that?

2035
01:14:46,510 --> 01:14:48,110
We used three carts for that.

2036
01:14:48,110 --> 01:14:51,010
We completed our bucket list in such a short time.

2037
01:14:51,010 --> 01:14:51,776
Yes, we did.

2038
01:14:52,243 --> 01:14:54,876
Thanks to the Yeom Tour

2039
01:14:54,876 --> 01:14:55,910
with all the information that

2040
01:14:55,910 --> 01:14:57,176
even local residents don't know,

2041
01:14:57,176 --> 01:14:59,243
I was so happy.

2042
01:14:59,243 --> 01:15:01,510
And we completed our bucket list during our trip.

2043
01:15:01,510 --> 01:15:02,476
Oh, dear.

2044
01:15:03,376 --> 01:15:04,776
- Thank you. / - Thank you so much.

2045
01:15:04,776 --> 01:15:06,976
We had a wonderful time at the top of the mountain.

2046
01:15:07,643 --> 01:15:09,843
It will stay with us as a happy memory

2047
01:15:09,843 --> 01:15:11,576
for the rest of our lives.

2048
01:15:11,576 --> 01:15:14,876
We meditated for about 10 minutes there.

2049
01:15:14,876 --> 01:15:17,776
- I cried at that time. / - I missed my family.

2050
01:15:17,776 --> 01:15:20,610
The whole thing is what you've learned

2051
01:15:20,610 --> 01:15:22,510
the hard way by living in Vietnam.

2052
01:15:22,510 --> 01:15:25,643
You showed us the essence of Vietnam.

2053
01:15:25,643 --> 01:15:28,476
I'm glad that you've met a lot of good people.

2054
01:15:28,476 --> 01:15:29,743
I'll introduce you to my friends

2055
01:15:29,743 --> 01:15:31,676
when they go on a trip to Hanoi.

2056
01:15:31,676 --> 01:15:34,610
- He's Yeomnoi. / - I'll introduce Yeomnoi to them.

2057
01:15:34,610 --> 01:15:37,776
- Did you just call me Yeomnoi? / - A new name.

2058
01:15:37,776 --> 01:15:39,910
It was the best.

2059
01:15:39,910 --> 01:15:41,376
I love the Yeom Gyeonghwan Tour.

2060
01:15:41,376 --> 01:15:44,343
Gyeonghwan looked great during the trip.

2061
01:15:44,343 --> 01:15:46,643
I'm nervous. They're talking about a celebratory drink.

2062
01:15:47,143 --> 01:15:49,376
Let's have a celebratory drink.

2063
01:15:50,176 --> 01:15:53,510
Everyone, please come to Hanoi.

2064
01:15:58,076 --> 01:15:59,176
It's so cool.

2065
01:15:59,910 --> 01:16:01,343
It must've been real nice.

2066
01:16:01,343 --> 01:16:02,410
It was really nice.

2067
01:16:04,810 --> 01:16:06,343
I'm so nervous now.

2068
01:16:06,343 --> 01:16:09,976
- Thank you. / - Thank you.

2069
01:16:10,243 --> 01:16:11,610
Eric, how did you feel?

2070
01:16:11,610 --> 01:16:12,643
You watched it without saying anything.

2071
01:16:12,643 --> 01:16:15,943
I was so jealous watching it.

2072
01:16:15,943 --> 01:16:17,676
I really want to go there and try the food.

2073
01:16:17,676 --> 01:16:19,310
What would you like to eat there?

2074
01:16:19,310 --> 01:16:22,076
- Lau looked good. / - Right?

2075
01:16:22,076 --> 01:16:25,443
I want to have a drink with lau.

2076
01:16:25,443 --> 01:16:28,076
- Do you drink? / - I do.

2077
01:16:28,076 --> 01:16:29,243
Really?

2078
01:16:29,776 --> 01:16:32,143
And Gyeonghwan had a hard time there

2079
01:16:32,143 --> 01:16:34,476
but it's a lot closer than Ha Long Bay.

2080
01:16:34,476 --> 01:16:36,710
It's called Ha Long Bay of inland.

2081
01:16:37,443 --> 01:16:39,376
You should go to Ninh Binh

2082
01:16:39,376 --> 01:16:41,910
if you want to go boating.

2083
01:16:41,910 --> 01:16:44,710
Ninh Binh is famous now

2084
01:16:44,710 --> 01:16:46,710
so it has a lot of tourists.

2085
01:16:46,710 --> 01:16:48,343
But we went to a hidden attraction

2086
01:16:48,343 --> 01:16:50,643
a little further in.

2087
01:16:50,643 --> 01:16:53,810
Yeom Tour was the first one to show the place.

2088
01:16:53,810 --> 01:16:55,243
- That's why the place was so quiet. / - Right.

2089
01:16:55,243 --> 01:16:57,243
- You should find hidden attractions. / - Right.

2090
01:16:57,243 --> 01:16:58,543
- Let's stand up. / - It's time...

2091
01:16:58,543 --> 01:17:00,043
To check the cost.

2092
01:17:00,043 --> 01:17:02,243
The total amount we spent for 3 days...

2093
01:17:02,243 --> 01:17:04,710
- In Hanoi. / - The total cost...

2094
01:17:04,710 --> 01:17:07,010
Excluding the airline tickets.

2095
01:17:07,010 --> 01:17:08,676
- Per person... / - Per person!

2096
01:17:08,676 --> 01:17:11,276
We spent $217.70.

2097
01:17:11,743 --> 01:17:12,943
What did you say?

2098
01:17:12,943 --> 01:17:16,676
- $210? / - $217.70.

2099
01:17:16,676 --> 01:17:18,510
- What... / - For 3 days?

2100
01:17:18,510 --> 01:17:19,843
- For 3 days? / - We ate all that food.

2101
01:17:19,843 --> 01:17:21,076
It's good. Let's vote right away.

2102
01:17:21,076 --> 01:17:23,543
- Stand up. / - $210.

2103
01:17:23,543 --> 01:17:25,543
Would you go to Hanoi

2104
01:17:25,543 --> 01:17:28,810
according to the Yeom Tour plan?

2105
01:17:28,810 --> 01:17:30,643
Please vote.

2106
01:17:32,476 --> 01:17:35,643
(Yeom Tour made a new plan for Hanoi)

2107
01:17:36,610 --> 01:17:39,110
(What will the judges choose?)

2108
01:17:39,676 --> 01:17:42,576
Boracay next week. What will you do?

2109
01:17:43,510 --> 01:17:45,143
- What? / - We're fine.

2110
01:17:45,143 --> 01:17:47,543
- Don't say weird things. / - We're fine.

2111
01:17:47,543 --> 01:17:49,143
- Seriously... / - If only you didn't do that.

2112
01:17:49,143 --> 01:17:51,010
- I know. / - I'm so worried.

2113
01:17:51,010 --> 01:17:53,476
Boom, Jihye, you have something special, right?

2114
01:17:53,476 --> 01:17:56,143
Don't worry. Our trip will be totally different.

2115
01:17:58,176 --> 01:17:59,276
(Next week)

2116
01:18:00,610 --> 01:18:01,843
This is amazing.

2117
01:18:01,843 --> 01:18:03,376
Boracay is incredible.

2118
01:18:05,343 --> 01:18:07,143
This is Boracay.

2119
01:18:07,143 --> 01:18:09,410
I prepared a talent for you.

2120
01:18:09,410 --> 01:18:12,276
Koreans don't know this course.

2121
01:18:12,276 --> 01:18:13,443
It's lifting.

2122
01:18:15,276 --> 01:18:16,676
It's the hottest place.

2123
01:18:17,743 --> 01:18:20,676
(No more obvious trips, new Boracay)

2124
01:18:21,510 --> 01:18:23,310
We met a new Boracay.

2125
01:18:23,310 --> 01:18:27,243
