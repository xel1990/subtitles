1
00:00:00,674 --> 00:00:04,040
(Numerous great tips on trips)

2
00:00:05,707 --> 00:00:06,940
(Hongbin and N of VIXX)

3
00:00:07,474 --> 00:00:08,640
(Special host, Lee Suji)

4
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:10,507
(Sojin of Girl's Day, Shin Ayoung)

5
00:00:10,507 --> 00:00:12,040
Travel is war!

6
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:15,140
Battle Trip!

7
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:18,274
Continuing from last week,

8
00:00:18,274 --> 00:00:20,874
we're with the trip designers who went on

9
00:00:20,874 --> 00:00:22,807
international festival trips.

10
00:00:22,807 --> 00:00:24,207
- Yes, welcome. / - Good to see you.

11
00:00:24,207 --> 00:00:26,774
- Hello. / - Hi.

12
00:00:26,774 --> 00:00:29,707
We have our 100 impartial judges

13
00:00:29,707 --> 00:00:31,874
who will vote on today's trips.

14
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:36,207
Our impartial judges.

15
00:00:36,907 --> 00:00:37,940
Continuing from last week,

16
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:40,540
we're enjoying international festivals.

17
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:43,274
We went to Bagan, Myanmar last week.

18
00:00:43,274 --> 00:00:45,774
Suji, what did you really think after seeing Bagan?

19
00:00:45,774 --> 00:00:48,140
I thought that I could really enjoy

20
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:51,140
going there with my friends.

21
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:52,940
- On the other hand... / - There's something else.

22
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:56,907
They practically didn't eat anything in Bagan.

23
00:00:56,907 --> 00:01:01,074
To be honest, you need to try the local food...

24
00:01:01,074 --> 00:01:02,740
- Right. / - I was a little disappointed...

25
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:04,940
Because they only ate a little.

26
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:07,174
But they usually eat a lot.

27
00:01:07,174 --> 00:01:09,074
We really ate a lot.

28
00:01:09,074 --> 00:01:12,640
I think the staff edited it out.

29
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:15,140
Let's be honest. Who eats more?

30
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:16,740
- I do. / - It's Sojin, right?

31
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:19,240
How does Sojin not gain any weight though?

32
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:21,740
I really like eating and I can't resist food.

33
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:26,740
I liked the food in Myanmar.

34
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:29,874
But I really wanted to try the hot air balloon.

35
00:01:29,874 --> 00:01:33,540
The hot air balloon that's on N's bucket list.

36
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:35,307
I think that was the best.

37
00:01:35,307 --> 00:01:38,040
But it costs $400 per person.

38
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:42,007
- I think it's a little expensive. / - It's $380.

39
00:01:42,007 --> 00:01:44,774
It's $400 if you round it up.

40
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:46,940
I don't think it's that expensive.

41
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:49,574
N, will you try the hot air balloon if you go there?

42
00:01:49,574 --> 00:01:51,507
Honestly, I think I'll try.

43
00:01:51,507 --> 00:01:53,774
- Winning aside. / - What about Hongbin?

44
00:01:53,774 --> 00:01:56,407
Isn't it a loss if you don't try it when you're there?

45
00:01:56,407 --> 00:01:57,174
That's right.

46
00:01:57,174 --> 00:01:59,207
It's a waste if you don't try it...

47
00:01:59,207 --> 00:02:01,074
- When you're there. / - You're right.

48
00:02:04,207 --> 00:02:06,840
But $400 is a bit...

49
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,174
It's strange if you don't try it when you're in Bagan.

50
00:02:09,807 --> 00:02:13,307
Don't do it if it's too expensive.

51
00:02:13,307 --> 00:02:16,007
- We're just recommending it. / - Of course.

52
00:02:16,007 --> 00:02:17,107
That's right.

53
00:02:17,107 --> 00:02:20,174
Let's go on a trip to Thailand.

54
00:02:20,174 --> 00:02:22,174
Are we going to Thailand again?

55
00:02:22,174 --> 00:02:23,474
- Yes, it's a festival this time. / - We've already been...

56
00:02:23,474 --> 00:02:26,340
We went to Pattaya, Chiang Mai...

57
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:29,074
- Phuket, Krabi and Bangkok. / - Bangkok as well.

58
00:02:29,074 --> 00:02:30,307
We went everywhere.

59
00:02:30,307 --> 00:02:33,874
I don't think we have anything left to see or eat.

60
00:02:33,874 --> 00:02:36,074
- There isn't anything new. / - Nothing is new.

61
00:02:36,074 --> 00:02:37,907
We saw the sea, jungle and everything.

62
00:02:37,907 --> 00:02:39,274
We've seen it all.

63
00:02:39,274 --> 00:02:41,274
Thailand is very big.

64
00:02:41,274 --> 00:02:43,874
What part of Thailand did

65
00:02:43,874 --> 00:02:45,540
N and Hongbin go to exactly?

66
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:47,507
Thailand is very famous

67
00:02:47,507 --> 00:02:49,274
for young backpackers.

68
00:02:49,274 --> 00:02:51,907
There's a famous place among those places.

69
00:02:52,507 --> 00:02:54,240
- It's a place called Pai. / - Pai?

70
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:57,040
Oh, my. It's really far from Bangkok.

71
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,340
It's really in the north.

72
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:00,440
- More north than Chiang Mai? / - Yes.

73
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:02,674
It's not that far from Chiang Mai.

74
00:03:02,674 --> 00:03:05,474
You can go back and forth while you're traveling.

75
00:03:05,474 --> 00:03:06,607
When going to Pai,

76
00:03:06,607 --> 00:03:09,574
there's a direct flight to Chiang Mai.

77
00:03:09,574 --> 00:03:11,340
How long does it take to Chiang Mai?

78
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:15,107
It takes about 5 to 6 hours.

79
00:03:15,107 --> 00:03:17,474
You also have to take a car from Chiang Mai.

80
00:03:17,474 --> 00:03:20,507
It takes about 3 hours to arrive in Pai.

81
00:03:21,674 --> 00:03:24,607
- It's far. / - 6 hours and 3 hours add up to 9 hours.

82
00:03:24,607 --> 00:03:25,974
It'd be worth it, right?

83
00:03:25,974 --> 00:03:27,307
- It was so nice. / - Hongbin?

84
00:03:27,307 --> 00:03:28,607
It has to be good.

85
00:03:28,607 --> 00:03:31,407
I've never heard about Pai.

86
00:03:31,407 --> 00:03:33,040
What did it feel like when you first arrived?

87
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,340
We got off at a station.

88
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:37,407
It felt like a clean and quiet country village.

89
00:03:37,407 --> 00:03:39,074
The thing is that

90
00:03:39,074 --> 00:03:40,640
a lot of people have been

91
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,407
to famous travel sites.

92
00:03:42,407 --> 00:03:43,874
There already are a lot of reviews

93
00:03:43,874 --> 00:03:45,440
and photos online.

94
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,874
But it's not like that for Pai.

95
00:03:46,874 --> 00:03:47,774
It's not that well known yet?

96
00:03:47,774 --> 00:03:49,374
It's more famous to the locals.

97
00:03:49,374 --> 00:03:51,707
It's more famous to travel specialists.

98
00:03:51,707 --> 00:03:53,740
- It's a hidden place. / - Yes, it's a hidden travel site.

99
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:55,540
- It has its advantages. / - That's right.

100
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:57,374
How was your teamwork during the trip?

101
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:00,340
We're very different.

102
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:02,074
He's more digital.

103
00:04:02,074 --> 00:04:04,174
And I'm analog.

104
00:04:04,174 --> 00:04:04,907
That's unexpected.

105
00:04:04,907 --> 00:04:06,307
He plans thoroughly before the trip.

106
00:04:06,307 --> 00:04:08,174
I like to do things spontaneously

107
00:04:08,174 --> 00:04:10,240
when I see something there.

108
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:10,774
Spontaneous.

109
00:04:10,774 --> 00:04:12,240
The bad thing about planning is...

110
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,974
- If you miss out it's such a waste. / - Right.

111
00:04:13,974 --> 00:04:15,874
It feels like a loss.

112
00:04:15,874 --> 00:04:17,474
That means you make a good team.

113
00:04:17,474 --> 00:04:19,440
- Right, we were a good team. / - Yeah.

114
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,407
Hongbin?

115
00:04:22,207 --> 00:04:23,474
Do you like analog methods?

116
00:04:23,474 --> 00:04:25,640
Yes, I like to take photos with a film camera...

117
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:27,807
- Instead of a digital camera. / - Really?

118
00:04:27,807 --> 00:04:29,407
I like things like that.

119
00:04:29,407 --> 00:04:31,574
I use Bluetooth devices.

120
00:04:32,407 --> 00:04:34,807
He carries a tripod and uses Bluetooth to take photos.

121
00:04:34,807 --> 00:04:37,307
It's like someone else took the photos for us.

122
00:04:37,307 --> 00:04:38,174
Without using your hands?

123
00:04:38,174 --> 00:04:40,574
You can't always ask people to take photos for you.

124
00:04:40,574 --> 00:04:43,474
I use tripods and Bluetooth devices

125
00:04:43,474 --> 00:04:44,607
to take photos according

126
00:04:44,607 --> 00:04:45,807
to our poses and composition.

127
00:04:45,807 --> 00:04:46,840
Wait a minute.

128
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:49,040
Okay, what's important is that I heard

129
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:52,440
that our team spent more money than Thailand.

130
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:54,140
It is cheap over there?

131
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:56,340
- We're most confident about this. / - Pai?

132
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:57,707
- Things are cheap in Bangkok. / - Yes.

133
00:04:57,707 --> 00:05:00,874
The prices are about two-thirds of Bangkok.

134
00:05:00,874 --> 00:05:03,374
It's also a little cheaper than Chiang Mai.

135
00:05:03,374 --> 00:05:06,907
You can eat rice noodles for $2 in Pai restaurants.

136
00:05:06,907 --> 00:05:08,607
It was $1.60 for us.

137
00:05:08,607 --> 00:05:13,274
We have a whole chicken in ours.

138
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:16,574
We have a whole chicken in ours.

139
00:05:16,574 --> 00:05:18,474
You'd better have a whole chicken in it.

140
00:05:18,474 --> 00:05:20,607
You can't see the rice noodles because of the chicken.

141
00:05:20,607 --> 00:05:22,474
It's a whole chicken if there's a couple of drumsticks.

142
00:05:22,474 --> 00:05:23,874
- Right? / - Of course.

143
00:05:23,874 --> 00:05:26,074
The soup tastes different.

144
00:05:26,074 --> 00:05:27,707
The amount and quality is different.

145
00:05:27,707 --> 00:05:31,407
And you can still bargain in Pai.

146
00:05:31,407 --> 00:05:34,140
Hongbin studied some Thai.

147
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:36,407
He worked hard to get good deals.

148
00:05:36,407 --> 00:05:38,074
He was in charge of language.

149
00:05:38,074 --> 00:05:41,374
- Thai? / - Before we watch the trip...

150
00:05:41,374 --> 00:05:43,574
Could you teach us some Thai words?

151
00:05:43,574 --> 00:05:45,374
We're different from them.

152
00:05:45,374 --> 00:05:47,740
"Can you give us a plate?"

153
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:49,640
Excuse me?

154
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:52,140
Can you give us a plate?

155
00:05:53,674 --> 00:05:54,874
We're not like that.

156
00:05:55,307 --> 00:05:57,774
It was the New Year when we went there.

157
00:05:57,774 --> 00:05:59,874
We went there when they started the New Year.

158
00:05:59,874 --> 00:06:01,740
That's when you say, "Sawadi pi maikap."

159
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:02,740
Happy New Year.

160
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:04,807
"Sawadi pi maikap."

161
00:06:04,807 --> 00:06:06,240
"Sawadi pi maikap."

162
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,007
That's the phrase we used the most.

163
00:06:08,007 --> 00:06:09,140
That's good.

164
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:10,774
"Can we have a discount?"

165
00:06:10,774 --> 00:06:12,074
"Lon noi na kap."

166
00:06:12,074 --> 00:06:14,640
- "Lon noi na kap." / - "Lon noi na kap."

167
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:15,940
You have to point it out.

168
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:17,240
"Ko lon noi na kap."

169
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,974
It means, "Please give me a discount on this."

170
00:06:18,974 --> 00:06:20,240
Did it work?

171
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,874
You have to say it a lot to work.

172
00:06:22,774 --> 00:06:26,640
When you say it, they smile and give you discount.

173
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:29,840
So I think they mark up the price quite a lot.

174
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,940
Since they give you a discount if you ask,

175
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:34,207
I kept asking for more.

176
00:06:34,207 --> 00:06:37,840
- So your trip was like backpacking trip. / - Yes.

177
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,740
What are some points to watch for?

178
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:41,207
To give you a teaser.

179
00:06:41,207 --> 00:06:44,574
The place where you can get your photo of a lifetime

180
00:06:44,574 --> 00:06:45,774
and is on everyone's bucket list.

181
00:06:45,774 --> 00:06:47,640
- The Grand Canyon. You know it, right? / - I do.

182
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:50,374
Would you believe me if I said they had it in Thailand?

183
00:06:50,374 --> 00:06:51,540
I just got goosebumps.

184
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:53,774
- Grand Canyon? / - You're exaggerating too much.

185
00:06:53,774 --> 00:06:56,140
- At first, even I... / - It must be something else.

186
00:06:56,140 --> 00:06:57,474
How can the Grand Canyon be there?

187
00:06:57,474 --> 00:06:58,840
When I heard it was a canyon,

188
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:01,440
I doubted it was like the original.

189
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,174
But when I saw it for myself,

190
00:07:03,174 --> 00:07:04,940
we felt electric like when you

191
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:06,707
were on the hot air balloon.

192
00:07:07,574 --> 00:07:08,440
It's not a lie.

193
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:10,174
- Let's hurry and see it. / - What's your tour name?

194
00:07:10,174 --> 00:07:10,674
Tour name.

195
00:07:10,674 --> 00:07:13,174
Our tour name is, 5, 6, 7, 8.

196
00:07:13,174 --> 00:07:15,474
Hakyeon, Hongbin, Tuhi Trip!

197
00:07:18,307 --> 00:07:20,707
(Incheon International Airport)

198
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,340
- What's going on? / - What?

199
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:25,674
That's the loudest anyone has left on a trip.

200
00:07:25,674 --> 00:07:27,274
Was it really like this?

201
00:07:30,707 --> 00:07:32,674
So cool.

202
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,774
(VIXX N, Hongbin attend IOC president's dinner)

203
00:07:36,407 --> 00:07:38,840
(They really are the idol group picked by the nation)

204
00:07:39,707 --> 00:07:42,774
(The leader of VIXX, N)

205
00:07:43,674 --> 00:07:47,274
(The visual master of VIXX, Hongbin)

206
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:51,240
(2 weeks before the trip)

207
00:07:51,607 --> 00:07:53,607
This week's theme is

208
00:07:53,607 --> 00:07:55,940
the international festival special.

209
00:07:56,740 --> 00:07:58,074
Festival.

210
00:08:01,274 --> 00:08:03,374
We don't really know about international festivals.

211
00:08:03,374 --> 00:08:05,774
We don't know what kind of festivals there are.

212
00:08:05,774 --> 00:08:06,474
Do you know any?

213
00:08:06,474 --> 00:08:09,074
I thought of the first festival that came to mind.

214
00:08:09,074 --> 00:08:11,440
- What is it? / - The ice fish festival.

215
00:08:13,407 --> 00:08:15,407
I really want to go there.

216
00:08:15,407 --> 00:08:17,840
- Ice fishing is fun. / - It's fun.

217
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,540
It's held in Inje.

218
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:22,440
Pi Mai Festival, Thingyan,

219
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:24,707
Choul Chnam Thmey in Cambodia,

220
00:08:24,707 --> 00:08:28,107
Singapore, Japan. How many pages is this?

221
00:08:28,107 --> 00:08:29,440
- If we could just go... / - So many festivals.

222
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:30,907
There are a lot of festivals around the world.

223
00:08:30,907 --> 00:08:32,640
I like all festivals.

224
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,507
I think Songkran is nice.

225
00:08:34,507 --> 00:08:37,140
I received the most recommendations for Thailand

226
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:38,074
to travel to.

227
00:08:38,074 --> 00:08:42,474
It's because you can get a lot of inner healing there.

228
00:08:42,474 --> 00:08:44,907
The prices are low.

229
00:08:44,907 --> 00:08:47,107
- There is a lot of good food. / - Of course.

230
00:08:47,107 --> 00:08:48,840
And they even have a festival there.

231
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:51,574
- There's no reason not to go. / - That's right.

232
00:08:51,574 --> 00:08:54,140
Okay, Songkran.

233
00:08:56,474 --> 00:09:00,307
It's held everywhere in Thailand.

234
00:09:00,307 --> 00:09:03,040
Bangkok, Chiang Mai, Pattaya and Ko Samui.

235
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,840
I think it's held everywhere.

236
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:09,274
It originally started from Chiang Mai.

237
00:09:09,274 --> 00:09:12,174
The original always has a long history.

238
00:09:12,174 --> 00:09:15,040
- We have to try the original. / - It has the most variety.

239
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,907
The most various experiences there.

240
00:09:16,907 --> 00:09:20,407
They went to Chiang Mai on Battle Trip before.

241
00:09:20,407 --> 00:09:21,307
They did.

242
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:23,974
We were surprised. We thought they were the locals.

243
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:27,174
- It was so fun. / - I was really surprised.

244
00:09:27,174 --> 00:09:28,540
They were so...

245
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:32,774
(Thailand, Songkran Festival)

246
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:36,507
- It's such a famous festival. / - That's right.

247
00:09:39,107 --> 00:09:41,107
How great would that be?

248
00:09:41,107 --> 00:09:42,374
It gets more and more aggressive.

249
00:09:42,374 --> 00:09:44,174
I got hit by water.

250
00:09:45,407 --> 00:09:47,774
They even throw water balloons.

251
00:09:47,774 --> 00:09:49,107
They throw water balloons.

252
00:09:49,107 --> 00:09:50,374
Those water guns are really strong.

253
00:09:50,374 --> 00:09:52,240
It's stronger than expected.

254
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:58,507
But this can't be the only event on our itinerary.

255
00:09:58,507 --> 00:09:59,840
We can't spray water the whole time.

256
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,674
It's from the 13th to the 15th.

257
00:10:01,674 --> 00:10:03,207
We just need a day to enjoy this.

258
00:10:03,207 --> 00:10:04,407
We should do it on our last day.

259
00:10:04,407 --> 00:10:06,140
We'll go all out on our last day.

260
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:08,407
We ought to be exhausted on our flight back to Korea.

261
00:10:08,407 --> 00:10:10,540
If we do go to Chiang Mai...

262
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:11,974
Other things to do around there.

263
00:10:11,974 --> 00:10:13,640
Let's make it a backpacking trip.

264
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:16,074
Backpacking there would be perfect for

265
00:10:16,074 --> 00:10:17,640
young travelers like us.

266
00:10:19,307 --> 00:10:20,007
It comes up right away.

267
00:10:20,007 --> 00:10:22,707
The resting place for backpackers around the world,

268
00:10:22,707 --> 00:10:23,707
Pai.

269
00:10:23,707 --> 00:10:26,374
We probably can't visit everywhere,

270
00:10:26,374 --> 00:10:28,040
but there's a lot we can do there.

271
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:30,874
People call it Utopai.

272
00:10:30,874 --> 00:10:31,974
That's really impressive.

273
00:10:31,974 --> 00:10:32,974
- Utopai? / - Yeah.

274
00:10:32,974 --> 00:10:34,674
- What's that? / - Utopia spelt with Pai.

275
00:10:34,674 --> 00:10:36,407
Ah, Utopai.

276
00:10:36,407 --> 00:10:38,474
(Everyone is free to do nothing here)

277
00:10:39,374 --> 00:10:40,907
(Utopai)

278
00:10:40,907 --> 00:10:43,674
It's packed with backpackers.

279
00:10:43,674 --> 00:10:44,740
They really look free.

280
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:46,574
They seem relaxed.

281
00:10:47,174 --> 00:10:48,440
Utopai.

282
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:49,674
5, 6, 7, 8.

283
00:10:49,674 --> 00:10:51,140
Hakyeon, Hongbin, Tuhi Trip.

284
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:58,340
(He is the most adorable guy)

285
00:10:58,674 --> 00:11:00,407
Hey, Hongbin. Let's start this.

286
00:11:00,907 --> 00:11:02,307
I'll get you.

287
00:11:02,307 --> 00:11:03,440
I really have nothing.

288
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,207
Get moving.

289
00:11:05,207 --> 00:11:06,674
You're trying too hard.

290
00:11:07,207 --> 00:11:08,740
I'll get you.

291
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:10,207
You do it.

292
00:11:10,207 --> 00:11:12,440
(He's in charge of Thai)

293
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:13,374
He's good.

294
00:11:13,374 --> 00:11:15,107
I just said what's in the book.

295
00:11:15,107 --> 00:11:16,474
I didn't know so I kept looking at the book.

296
00:11:17,874 --> 00:11:18,874
It's so pretty.

297
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,607
Haven't we won already?

298
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:23,774
It's no joke.

299
00:11:23,774 --> 00:11:25,174
What is that?

300
00:11:29,307 --> 00:11:35,907
(Incheon International Airport to Chiang Mai)

301
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:39,607
We're finally here.

302
00:11:40,374 --> 00:11:41,140
You arrived late.

303
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:42,974
I want to get out of here

304
00:11:42,974 --> 00:11:45,974
and smell the different air to know we're here.

305
00:11:45,974 --> 00:11:47,740
The moment we get out of here,

306
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:48,840
you'll feel it right away.

307
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:50,874
It's really different.

308
00:11:50,874 --> 00:11:53,040
- We're almost out. / - It feels real now.

309
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:55,107
Now...

310
00:11:55,107 --> 00:11:56,674
1, 2, 3. Ta-da.

311
00:11:56,674 --> 00:11:58,274
Wow, the heat.

312
00:11:58,974 --> 00:12:02,207
- It's not much. / - I planned a tight schedule.

313
00:12:03,074 --> 00:12:04,740
We'll get the most out of everything.

314
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:06,074
We're going to a hotel first, right?

315
00:12:06,074 --> 00:12:08,007
Of course. I planned a very detailed

316
00:12:08,007 --> 00:12:10,074
and busy schedule for us. Don't you worry.

317
00:12:11,474 --> 00:12:14,007
- Then... / - Just trust me.

318
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:16,907
This is a tight schedule.

319
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:21,707
How is it? This is the hotel I booked.

320
00:12:21,707 --> 00:12:23,840
- I'm happy. / - This is the hotel for you.

321
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:25,307
Look at that. It's all yours.

322
00:12:25,307 --> 00:12:27,274
Wow, look at this place.

323
00:12:27,274 --> 00:12:30,074
We booked out the place so no one's here.

324
00:12:31,474 --> 00:12:34,074
- Should I change into my pajamas? / - Go ahead.

325
00:12:34,074 --> 00:12:36,540
The toilets are there.

326
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:38,207
- Ah... / - There's another one over there.

327
00:12:38,207 --> 00:12:39,640
Nice.

328
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:42,907
I'm kidding. We're waiting for a mini-van.

329
00:12:42,907 --> 00:12:43,674
Then we'll go.

330
00:12:43,674 --> 00:12:46,074
Are we waiting or sleeping here?

331
00:12:46,074 --> 00:12:47,940
Well, do whatever you want.

332
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:48,807
You can sleep here if you want.

333
00:12:48,807 --> 00:12:50,674
So this is our hotel then?

334
00:12:50,674 --> 00:12:52,040
Yeah, it is.

335
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:54,540
I'm kidding. We can just wait here.

336
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:57,007
- We're staying for a while, right? / - You bet.

337
00:12:57,007 --> 00:12:59,007
It could be 5 hours.

338
00:12:59,007 --> 00:13:00,607
- Right? / - We could be here till sunrise.

339
00:13:00,607 --> 00:13:03,040
If we go to Chiang Mai now,

340
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,874
it costs a lot of money.

341
00:13:04,874 --> 00:13:07,174
That's why we'll wait for a mini-van here

342
00:13:07,174 --> 00:13:08,140
and go.

343
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:10,040
You can just lie down here.

344
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:12,874
- Let's wait. / - I'll wake you when the van gets here.

345
00:13:12,874 --> 00:13:15,240
Hongbin, you hate things like that?

346
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:18,240
I'm fine with sleeping there.

347
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,974
But I had expectations of a hotel.

348
00:13:19,974 --> 00:13:23,207
It ruined my expectations.

349
00:13:23,207 --> 00:13:25,440
This is the charm of backpacking.

350
00:13:26,707 --> 00:13:29,174
(It's past midnight in no time)

351
00:13:29,174 --> 00:13:32,707
(Their first day comes to an end)

352
00:13:32,707 --> 00:13:35,140
That's how we wrapped up our first day.

353
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:37,940
- There's no staff. / - A day already passed?

354
00:13:40,074 --> 00:13:42,174
This is the last trip of my 20s.

355
00:13:43,674 --> 00:13:44,507
So tired.

356
00:13:45,607 --> 00:13:46,407
I was so tired.

357
00:13:46,407 --> 00:13:48,807
- What a great trip. / - I was so happy.

358
00:13:48,807 --> 00:13:50,640
- I look like I ate well, right? / - This is so cool.

359
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:52,807
I love this kind of backpacking trip.

360
00:13:52,807 --> 00:13:55,207
This is the last trip of my 20s.

361
00:13:55,207 --> 00:13:58,140
You're in the prime of your 20s.

362
00:13:58,140 --> 00:14:00,807
In order to enjoy our trip to the fullest,

363
00:14:00,807 --> 00:14:03,707
I made this reservation in Korea.

364
00:14:03,707 --> 00:14:05,340
- What is it? / - This is it!

365
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:09,440
It's so convenient.

366
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:12,140
- I booked it in Korea. / - This is great.

367
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:12,907
Great, great.

368
00:14:12,907 --> 00:14:15,340
We'll get there comfortably.

369
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:16,040
- Let's go. / - Let's get in.

370
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:18,407
It must make them feel like kings just in that van.

371
00:14:18,407 --> 00:14:19,740
They can lie down in the van.

372
00:14:24,374 --> 00:14:27,774
- The road is so bumpy. / - You're right.

373
00:14:27,774 --> 00:14:30,140
762 hills?

374
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:31,974
That was incredible.

375
00:14:31,974 --> 00:14:33,907
Was that the only way to get there?

376
00:14:33,907 --> 00:14:36,740
- They're providing light aircraft flights soon. / - Really?

377
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:39,474
We went before it was in service.

378
00:14:39,474 --> 00:14:41,774
From mid-May, with the light aircraft,

379
00:14:41,774 --> 00:14:43,307
it only takes 40 minutes.

380
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:48,240
(After the 762 hills along the mountainous road)

381
00:14:50,674 --> 00:15:00,340
(They arrive at a small rural town in North Thailand)

382
00:15:01,207 --> 00:15:03,407
(With its tranquility and charming vibes)

383
00:15:03,407 --> 00:15:06,574
(It stops backpackers in their tracks)

384
00:15:06,574 --> 00:15:10,140
- They're the typical backpackers. / - Exactly.

385
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:12,040
- There are so many. / - There are so many of them.

386
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:16,307
- Wow, these types of people... / - Right.

387
00:15:16,307 --> 00:15:19,674
This place is called as the resting place of backpackers.

388
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:27,040
We've arrived.

389
00:15:27,907 --> 00:15:29,140
It's sunny.

390
00:15:30,207 --> 00:15:31,774
Did you get to rest in the van?

391
00:15:31,774 --> 00:15:34,840
- We'd be in trouble if otherwise. / - This is the bus stop.

392
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:37,807
Everyone gets off the mini-van here.

393
00:15:37,807 --> 00:15:38,974
Let's go.

394
00:15:39,674 --> 00:15:42,740
Look. They're backpackers just like us.

395
00:15:44,607 --> 00:15:46,707
They won't know if we follow them.

396
00:15:46,707 --> 00:15:47,740
Watch me.

397
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:54,274
(Hongbin follows him when N does something)

398
00:15:54,274 --> 00:15:55,974
- No one cared about us. / - Right.

399
00:15:55,974 --> 00:15:57,940
We'll end up at another place.

400
00:15:57,940 --> 00:15:59,774
(This is fun)

401
00:16:00,407 --> 00:16:02,207
(Tuhi Trip, day 1 in Pai)

402
00:16:02,207 --> 00:16:03,874
(Looking around the city)

403
00:16:03,874 --> 00:16:06,740
I can feel a relaxed atmosphere.

404
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:08,740
Even when we're just walking the streets.

405
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:11,840
- It is less crowded than Bangkok. / - Right?

406
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:14,407
This feels like the countryside.

407
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:18,774
Moreover, the residents refused to develop this area

408
00:16:18,774 --> 00:16:20,640
into a tourist attraction, so it's all natural.

409
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:22,674
- It's really clean. / - You're right.

410
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:26,840
It's a drink. Let's buy one.

411
00:16:28,074 --> 00:16:32,140
- You go there for street foods like this. / - Right.

412
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:33,874
- It looks fresh. / - How do we greet them?

413
00:16:33,874 --> 00:16:35,907
- Sawadikap. / - Sawadikap.

414
00:16:35,907 --> 00:16:39,307
I'll organize these and come up with the itinerary.

415
00:16:39,307 --> 00:16:43,107
You should study Thai.

416
00:16:43,107 --> 00:16:45,274
We have this universal language.

417
00:16:45,274 --> 00:16:46,407
No, we don't.

418
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:49,907
If we want to do anything,

419
00:16:49,907 --> 00:16:51,174
we must be able to communicate.

420
00:16:51,174 --> 00:16:53,174
Don't you think a few phrases

421
00:16:53,174 --> 00:16:54,540
about daily life would suffice?

422
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:57,374
- Hongbin listens to the leader well. / - He does.

423
00:16:58,507 --> 00:17:01,307
- He complains but he complies. / - I can see that.

424
00:17:02,407 --> 00:17:05,507
Thai pronunciation is really difficult. Look at this.

425
00:17:06,807 --> 00:17:08,840
The way you read it is different.

426
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:12,807
There are initial consonants and final consonants.

427
00:17:12,807 --> 00:17:16,240
(Thai is just too difficult for Hongbin)

428
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:19,407
(What is this?)

429
00:17:19,407 --> 00:17:22,140
We should just give up on communication.

430
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:24,407
You picked the hardest one.

431
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:27,740
Hongbin acts like he won't do it...

432
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:29,440
- But he works hard. / - He does.

433
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:31,274
He even studied during the flight.

434
00:17:33,007 --> 00:17:34,107
Sawadikap.

435
00:17:35,174 --> 00:17:36,840
(Nervous)

436
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:40,340
I was really nervous at first.

437
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:42,140
(I just need to say what I studied from the book)

438
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:43,807
(I believe in you, Hongbin)

439
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:46,940
He kept reading the book.

440
00:17:47,274 --> 00:17:48,307
Nueng.

441
00:17:48,307 --> 00:17:49,574
One?

442
00:17:49,574 --> 00:17:50,974
He understood.

443
00:17:50,974 --> 00:17:52,540
In English?

444
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:54,240
After all that study.

445
00:17:55,307 --> 00:17:57,240
(What? Did he just speak English?)

446
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:59,540
- Watermelon, nueng. / - One?

447
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:01,040
One.

448
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:03,340
- Mango, one. / - He just said one.

449
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:06,674
- It's good. / - Mango?

450
00:18:06,674 --> 00:18:08,374
Mango and watermelon.

451
00:18:10,874 --> 00:18:12,007
It's so sweet.

452
00:18:12,007 --> 00:18:13,240
It is, isn't it?

453
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:14,907
It's good.

454
00:18:16,907 --> 00:18:19,307
- I'm shocked at how good it is. / - Right.

455
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:23,674
This is really sweet.

456
00:18:24,307 --> 00:18:26,474
We have to be careful of those kids.

457
00:18:27,074 --> 00:18:28,507
They're just playing with each other.

458
00:18:29,574 --> 00:18:31,207
They're shooting at us.

459
00:18:33,174 --> 00:18:35,274
- We're the target. / - So cute.

460
00:18:35,274 --> 00:18:37,074
So cute.

461
00:18:37,074 --> 00:18:38,974
- It's us. / - It's cute.

462
00:18:38,974 --> 00:18:42,907
He can't reach us.

463
00:18:42,907 --> 00:18:45,707
- It won't reach here. / - Can't get us.

464
00:18:46,207 --> 00:18:47,907
They teased them.

465
00:18:49,774 --> 00:18:51,807
His brother came out.

466
00:18:51,807 --> 00:18:55,207
- You should avoid the brother. / - His was stronger.

467
00:18:55,907 --> 00:18:57,474
Bye.

468
00:18:58,740 --> 00:18:59,674
So cute.

469
00:19:02,874 --> 00:19:04,374
Let's go. Let's go eat.

470
00:19:04,374 --> 00:19:07,407
I looked up a place for us to eat.

471
00:19:07,407 --> 00:19:09,907
- Did you make reservations? / - I did.

472
00:19:09,907 --> 00:19:12,574
- We found it already. / - This way.

473
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:18,607
(Traditional dish in northern Thailand, khao soi)

474
00:19:18,607 --> 00:19:20,340
That looks delicious.

475
00:19:22,874 --> 00:19:24,574
I heard this dish is very famous in the northern area.

476
00:19:24,574 --> 00:19:25,707
- Khao soi? / - Yes.

477
00:19:25,707 --> 00:19:28,174
I also heard that curry noodles are famous in Pai too.

478
00:19:28,174 --> 00:19:28,707
Curry?

479
00:19:28,707 --> 00:19:30,074
That's why we must try this dish at least once here.

480
00:19:30,074 --> 00:19:31,740
Let's just have a bowl of the noodles each.

481
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:34,340
There are a lot of street food and places to see.

482
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:35,240
- We walk around? / - Yeah.

483
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:39,874
I came up with a very detailed itinerary.

484
00:19:39,874 --> 00:19:43,074
No itinerary can't be more thoroughly planned.

485
00:19:44,807 --> 00:19:45,940
It's amazing.

486
00:19:50,607 --> 00:19:52,207
Kob khun kap.

487
00:19:52,207 --> 00:19:53,474
What's this topping?

488
00:19:54,807 --> 00:19:56,874
- That was really good. / - What is it?

489
00:19:58,540 --> 00:20:00,207
Do we put this in it?

490
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:02,874
No, wait. I'm going to ask.

491
00:20:02,874 --> 00:20:03,974
Do we add this?

492
00:20:03,974 --> 00:20:04,940
I'm going to ask.

493
00:20:05,807 --> 00:20:08,607
(He finally asks his first question in Thai)

494
00:20:08,607 --> 00:20:10,440
He can't understand the answer though.

495
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:13,907
- You have to understand. / - I asked him how to eat it.

496
00:20:15,007 --> 00:20:18,874
(Congratulations, Hongbin communicates in Thai)

497
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:22,307
I think you just choose the things you want to eat...

498
00:20:22,307 --> 00:20:24,674
- Are you sure? / - Yes, I asked him.

499
00:20:24,674 --> 00:20:26,407
- Okay, got it. / - Just add it.

500
00:20:28,707 --> 00:20:30,074
Right, right.

501
00:20:30,074 --> 00:20:33,207
That's meaningless.

502
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:35,407
I said something in Thai.

503
00:20:36,207 --> 00:20:38,074
You feel proud for communicating.

504
00:20:38,074 --> 00:20:41,840
Of course. That's how you learn a foreign language.

505
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:42,907
Shall we try it?

506
00:20:42,907 --> 00:20:44,807
- Should we eat? / - Let's eat.

507
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:47,240
That was so good.

508
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:49,440
I think it'll taste better if you put this in.

509
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,374
Let's see what it tastes like.

510
00:20:54,507 --> 00:20:56,040
It tastes like chips.

511
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:57,240
It's good.

512
00:20:58,107 --> 00:20:59,440
It's a little more...

513
00:21:02,074 --> 00:21:04,274
It's a little sweet, isn't it?

514
00:21:05,507 --> 00:21:06,774
Isn't it delicious?

515
00:21:07,774 --> 00:21:11,340
It's a little like instant curry noodles.

516
00:21:12,074 --> 00:21:14,940
Doesn't it taste like instant curry noodles?

517
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:15,974
This is delicious.

518
00:21:17,307 --> 00:21:20,840
I think this will really suit the taste of Koreans.

519
00:21:22,007 --> 00:21:24,540
It's spicy because of pepper, not chilies.

520
00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:26,574
- That's right. / - It tastes like pepper.

521
00:21:26,574 --> 00:21:28,140
Yes, it tastes like pepper.

522
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:30,907
- It's spicy. / - It's a little spicy.

523
00:21:30,907 --> 00:21:33,007
But it's not that spicy.

524
00:21:33,007 --> 00:21:34,640
Earlier...

525
00:21:36,507 --> 00:21:39,240
- It's good. / - How long will you hide your plans?

526
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:41,007
- I'm not hiding it. / - Really?

527
00:21:41,007 --> 00:21:43,507
You won't look forward to it if I tell you in advance.

528
00:21:43,507 --> 00:21:45,174
- I'm looking forward to it. / - No.

529
00:21:46,307 --> 00:21:49,440
Your expectations will be low. That's why.

530
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,107
But everything was nice until now.

531
00:21:51,107 --> 00:21:52,407
The hotel was nice.

532
00:21:52,407 --> 00:21:54,474
The airport hotel was nice.

533
00:21:54,474 --> 00:21:56,940
- That wasn't a hotel. / - Because I planned well...

534
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:58,574
I have an alternative when my plan fails.

535
00:21:58,574 --> 00:22:01,840
So don't worry. Just relax and enjoy everything.

536
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:04,707
You should just concentrate on speaking in Thai.

537
00:22:05,774 --> 00:22:07,840
(Embarrassed)

538
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:11,007
(They hurry up for their next schedule)

539
00:22:11,174 --> 00:22:13,807
(Tuhi Trip, day 1 in Pai)

540
00:22:13,807 --> 00:22:16,107
(A lodging like a fairy tale)

541
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:18,407
We have to move on scooters now.

542
00:22:18,407 --> 00:22:20,174
- Are we finally riding scooters? / - Of course.

543
00:22:20,174 --> 00:22:24,440
Like Jeju-do, we can go everywhere by scooter.

544
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:28,307
Most people travel on scooters

545
00:22:28,307 --> 00:22:30,074
rather than cars. Look.

546
00:22:30,074 --> 00:22:32,807
There are backpackers over there.

547
00:22:32,807 --> 00:22:34,140
They're riding scooters.

548
00:22:35,374 --> 00:22:38,207
You can go anywhere in 30 minutes.

549
00:22:38,207 --> 00:22:40,874
It must be so cool for everyone on scooters.

550
00:22:40,874 --> 00:22:44,540
- Let's also get rid of this heat. / - Okay.

551
00:22:44,540 --> 00:22:46,574
We have to find a scooter shop.

552
00:22:46,574 --> 00:22:48,407
That's amazing.

553
00:22:48,407 --> 00:22:49,607
They have cute ones.

554
00:22:49,607 --> 00:22:51,507
They had bikes for mountains.

555
00:22:51,507 --> 00:22:53,040
They even have racing ones.

556
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:54,140
They're pretty.

557
00:22:54,974 --> 00:22:57,507
The scooters were much cheaper than we expected.

558
00:22:58,074 --> 00:23:00,674
- 100 to 200 baht is cheap. / - Look at that.

559
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:04,140
This is nice.

560
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:06,107
This is cute.

561
00:23:06,874 --> 00:23:09,574
Boys think about riding those when they're young.

562
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:12,074
because they see them in cartoons.

563
00:23:12,074 --> 00:23:14,540
- Nice. / - It really was my dream as a kid.

564
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:16,140
- So pretty. / - They're unique.

565
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:18,007
Right, it was quite pretty.

566
00:23:18,007 --> 00:23:20,174
400 baht per day.

567
00:23:20,174 --> 00:23:22,640
400? That's not bad.

568
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,007
That's around $13.

569
00:23:24,007 --> 00:23:25,840
Is this $13 for 24 hours?

570
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:27,740
- For a day? / - Yes, for 24 hours.

571
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:29,740
- It's really cheap. / - That really is.

572
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:34,874
And if there's a problem while you're renting it,

573
00:23:34,874 --> 00:23:37,174
they'll come to help you if you call them.

574
00:23:37,174 --> 00:23:39,040
- They even provide on-site help. / - Yes.

575
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:41,774
This looks easier to ride.

576
00:23:42,174 --> 00:23:45,774
(It's time for them to ride it)

577
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:49,840
Wow.

578
00:23:50,807 --> 00:23:52,574
(I'm ready too)

579
00:23:53,274 --> 00:23:54,307
Bye-bye.

580
00:23:54,307 --> 00:23:55,674
See you tomorrow.

581
00:23:55,674 --> 00:23:57,140
Here we go.

582
00:23:58,907 --> 00:24:01,374
- This is fast. It's cool. / - It's really cool.

583
00:24:04,307 --> 00:24:07,674
(If you ride out a little bit from downtown)

584
00:24:09,707 --> 00:24:11,674
That road was so pretty.

585
00:24:11,674 --> 00:24:13,440
(The Tuhi Trip race while feeling the coolness)

586
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:15,574
I also wanted to do that.

587
00:24:16,374 --> 00:24:18,207
- I was so jealous. / - But you had to drive.

588
00:24:19,007 --> 00:24:21,907
(The Tuhi Trip race while feeling the coolness)

589
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:24,940
It's cool.

590
00:24:26,174 --> 00:24:27,874
It feels liberating.

591
00:24:27,874 --> 00:24:30,274
I want to live freely and relaxed like this here.

592
00:24:30,274 --> 00:24:32,607
You can see elephants while riding.

593
00:24:32,607 --> 00:24:33,207
Elephants?

594
00:24:33,207 --> 00:24:37,174
- They raise them like pets at home. / - Look!

595
00:24:37,174 --> 00:24:38,440
- Elephants? Where? / - Next to the road.

596
00:24:40,207 --> 00:24:41,407
It's an elephant.

597
00:24:42,507 --> 00:24:43,607
That's amazing.

598
00:24:43,607 --> 00:24:45,274
It's really big.

599
00:24:47,007 --> 00:24:50,807
(They greet an elephant)

600
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:59,774
(N and Hongbin race through Pai)

601
00:24:59,774 --> 00:25:01,874
- That's so pretty. / - It was so cool.

602
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:08,474
Lodging is the most important thing during a trip.

603
00:25:09,974 --> 00:25:11,340
Lodging.

604
00:25:12,974 --> 00:25:16,607
What is this? Is a house really on top of a tree?

605
00:25:17,274 --> 00:25:19,507
There's a house on top of a tree.

606
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:23,574
- Oh, my. / - It's my dream to stay there.

607
00:25:24,074 --> 00:25:26,007
Isn't this a must-visit?

608
00:25:26,007 --> 00:25:27,674
There's no reason for us not to go there.

609
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:32,474
(A lodging like a fairy tale)

610
00:25:33,307 --> 00:25:37,040
(11 minutes by scooter from downtown)

611
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:38,507
It's not far.

612
00:25:38,507 --> 00:25:41,807
You can go everywhere by scooter.

613
00:25:41,807 --> 00:25:43,907
You can go anywhere by scooter in 30 minutes.

614
00:25:44,974 --> 00:25:47,107
A room that I prepared for you is waiting.

615
00:25:47,107 --> 00:25:48,040
We're almost there.

616
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:50,607
Did we find all of our rooms from nature?

617
00:25:50,607 --> 00:25:52,374
You can sleep here if you want.

618
00:25:52,374 --> 00:25:53,007
This looks cozy.

619
00:25:53,007 --> 00:25:55,307
- Is this our room? / - Of course.

620
00:25:55,307 --> 00:25:57,774
Since the weather is warm.

621
00:25:57,774 --> 00:26:01,407
I'm joking. Our real room is over there.

622
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:05,207
We're going to sleep up there.

623
00:26:05,207 --> 00:26:06,507
I love it!

624
00:26:09,574 --> 00:26:11,274
(Built on top of a tree deep in the mountains)

625
00:26:11,274 --> 00:26:12,507
It's really in the midst of nature.

626
00:26:12,507 --> 00:26:13,974
- Yes, like that. / - That's fascinating.

627
00:26:17,174 --> 00:26:19,274
- I'm curious about how it's set up. / - Is this possible?

628
00:26:19,274 --> 00:26:21,074
Yes, let's look into it.

629
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:36,674
(The hideout someone dreamt about became a reality)

630
00:26:39,774 --> 00:26:42,540
(Tree house)

631
00:26:43,174 --> 00:26:44,940
This is the stairs.

632
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:46,874
You'd think it's hot in there, right?

633
00:26:46,874 --> 00:26:51,174
It's cool because it's a forest.

634
00:26:51,174 --> 00:26:51,907
Wow.

635
00:26:53,107 --> 00:26:55,240
This really feels like climbing up a tree.

636
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:57,274
This is interesting.

637
00:26:57,274 --> 00:27:01,174
- They don't have a weight limit, right? / - No, no.

638
00:27:01,174 --> 00:27:03,440
It'll be hard for old people.

639
00:27:03,774 --> 00:27:06,174
They also have a room like this on lower floors.

640
00:27:07,374 --> 00:27:09,140
Look at this.

641
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:12,740
That's perfect for backpackers.

642
00:27:12,740 --> 00:27:15,907
- Backpackers... / - This is so nice.

643
00:27:15,907 --> 00:27:18,374
- They carry backpacks instead of carriers. / - Right.

644
00:27:18,374 --> 00:27:20,440
That's why it's a better room for backpackers.

645
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:23,740
It would be really nice for a backpacker couple.

646
00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:25,107
That's right.

647
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:28,774
It's on the top.

648
00:27:28,774 --> 00:27:31,207
This is almost like a ladder, not stairs.

649
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:35,240
(They have to take one more flight of stairs)

650
00:27:37,174 --> 00:27:39,407
(You have to watch your head)

651
00:27:39,407 --> 00:27:42,074
That's N's fault. No connection to the accommodation.

652
00:27:42,774 --> 00:27:44,640
You have to be careful of your head.

653
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:49,207
You sleep on beds up here.

654
00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:51,574
Oh, my. It's so nice.

655
00:27:51,574 --> 00:27:53,574
It's the coziest room ever.

656
00:27:54,907 --> 00:27:57,540
(You can see the room after you go up the stairs)

657
00:27:58,174 --> 00:27:59,907
- It's so cute. / - Inside a tree...

658
00:27:59,907 --> 00:28:02,374
- It's so nice. / - The tree trunk is in the middle.

659
00:28:02,374 --> 00:28:04,574
- It's so cute. / - It's so nice.

660
00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:08,774
- They didn't cut the tree at all. / - That's right.

661
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:11,674
This is the bedroom.

662
00:28:13,707 --> 00:28:15,574
We have to find something bad.

663
00:28:16,207 --> 00:28:18,507
How expensive is it during the peak season?

664
00:28:18,507 --> 00:28:19,507
It's 700 baht.

665
00:28:19,507 --> 00:28:21,674
- How much is it? / - It's $24.

666
00:28:21,674 --> 00:28:23,140
- For one night? / - Yes.

667
00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:24,707
You spent $100 for your room, right?

668
00:28:26,107 --> 00:28:28,907
We stayed in a high-quality hotel with a pool.

669
00:28:28,907 --> 00:28:29,940
Our room is one with nature.

670
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:31,840
That's just nature and a room.

671
00:28:33,174 --> 00:28:34,507
It's really nice.

672
00:28:34,507 --> 00:28:36,674
- They even have Wi-Fi there. / - I really want to go there.

673
00:28:38,774 --> 00:28:41,507
- Strange, right? / - That's the best.

674
00:28:41,507 --> 00:28:43,640
You can see the scenery outside.

675
00:28:44,474 --> 00:28:46,474
Look, there aren't any modern buildings outside.

676
00:28:46,474 --> 00:28:48,674
There aren't any of the views we usually see.

677
00:28:48,674 --> 00:28:50,374
It's forest everywhere.

678
00:28:50,374 --> 00:28:52,407
It's simple but pretty.

679
00:28:52,407 --> 00:28:54,707
I want a house like this, don't you?

680
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:58,007
(They leave their tired bodies to nature)

681
00:28:58,007 --> 00:29:00,174
I can hear the water.

682
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:06,174
You can't hear sounds like this in Seoul.

683
00:29:06,174 --> 00:29:08,840
- It's like we're in a temple. / - Yes.

684
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:11,440
You're from a temple.

685
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:14,940
- You were a boy monk. / - I grew up in a temple.

686
00:29:15,674 --> 00:29:17,174
- What? / - In a temple?

687
00:29:17,174 --> 00:29:18,807
I lived in a temple until kindergarten.

688
00:29:18,807 --> 00:29:20,440
He was a boy monk.

689
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:22,574
Aren't you the first ever boy monk turned idol?

690
00:29:23,540 --> 00:29:25,040
- That's right. / - I'd think so.

691
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:26,607
That's got to be unprecedented.

692
00:29:26,607 --> 00:29:29,574
- You were a boy monk. / - I grew up in a temple.

693
00:29:31,007 --> 00:29:34,774
If you look to the side, all you see is forest.

694
00:29:34,774 --> 00:29:36,640
I'm feel like I'm getting healthier.

695
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:38,840
For 4 days and 3 nights,

696
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:41,207
I think I could just lie still here.

697
00:29:41,207 --> 00:29:43,007
I feel like I'm getting healthy.

698
00:29:43,907 --> 00:29:45,574
You must be so happy

699
00:29:45,574 --> 00:29:48,640
to be in such a happy place with me.

700
00:29:49,107 --> 00:29:50,740
You must be so happy.

701
00:29:53,274 --> 00:29:54,507
You didn't even look at him.

702
00:29:54,507 --> 00:29:56,540
I was so grateful for that tree in the middle.

703
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:01,440
- I really liked that place. / - The scenery was beautiful.

704
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:05,607
A breeze blows in through the window.

705
00:30:05,607 --> 00:30:07,374
We didn't need a fan or anything.

706
00:30:08,207 --> 00:30:09,574
- It's already pretty. / - Let's go.

707
00:30:09,574 --> 00:30:10,674
We better get moving.

708
00:30:12,574 --> 00:30:15,240
There's no reason for us to not win.

709
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:16,340
It really wasn't cold.

710
00:30:16,340 --> 00:30:18,140
That's really nice.

711
00:30:18,540 --> 00:30:20,840
(Tuhi Trip, day 1 in Pai)

712
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:23,240
(Bamboo bridge)

713
00:30:24,774 --> 00:30:27,974
(28 minutes by scooter to bamboo bridge)

714
00:30:27,974 --> 00:30:29,940
- You go everywhere on scooters. / - Yes.

715
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:31,807
We can reach everywhere in 30 minutes.

716
00:30:32,574 --> 00:30:34,974
Is that a plot of land?

717
00:30:36,540 --> 00:30:38,240
Is that what it's called?

718
00:30:38,674 --> 00:30:41,440
This is bamboo bridge.

719
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:43,140
Bamboo?

720
00:30:43,974 --> 00:30:47,107
- This is bamboo? / - It's not hip hop.

721
00:30:47,107 --> 00:30:49,140
English words sound hip hop.

722
00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:52,240
- This is called bamboo bridge. / - Bamboo bridge.

723
00:30:53,874 --> 00:30:55,274
I'm so excited, right?

724
00:30:56,107 --> 00:30:57,607
(Bubbly)

725
00:30:57,607 --> 00:31:00,907
There's a lot of water here. It feels really green.

726
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:05,074
(Set up on top of the rice paddy instead of a river)

727
00:31:05,074 --> 00:31:06,174
That's how beautiful it looks.

728
00:31:06,174 --> 00:31:07,607
That's how it looks.

729
00:31:07,607 --> 00:31:10,974
It's the dry season now.

730
00:31:10,974 --> 00:31:13,740
- You can take great photos there. / - Right.

731
00:31:14,607 --> 00:31:17,074
Oh, no. It looks like a desert.

732
00:31:17,074 --> 00:31:18,374
Why didn't we come when it's green?

733
00:31:18,374 --> 00:31:20,440
It's so different. This is so beautiful.

734
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:22,307
- This is how it looks. / - It's a mudflat.

735
00:31:22,307 --> 00:31:26,074
- It's dry season. / - You have to come in season.

736
00:31:26,074 --> 00:31:29,274
Right. Still, isn't it beautiful?

737
00:31:30,574 --> 00:31:36,540
(It's just an ordinary field)

738
00:31:39,307 --> 00:31:46,607
(Tourists want to enjoy this cozy and tranquil field)

739
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:50,407
(The field captures the tourists' steps)

740
00:31:50,407 --> 00:31:53,340
I love how breezy it is. Don't you agree?

741
00:31:53,340 --> 00:31:56,007
I wish the breeze would continue. It's cool.

742
00:31:56,707 --> 00:31:58,874
Get closer to the signpost.

743
00:31:59,507 --> 00:32:00,940
Get closer to the signpost.

744
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:03,207
1, 2, 3. 1, 2, 3.

745
00:32:03,740 --> 00:32:06,707
(Bamboo bridge is best in October)

746
00:32:07,074 --> 00:32:08,840
This comes up first when you look up Pai.

747
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:11,307
It's something you must do here.

748
00:32:11,307 --> 00:32:14,040
When I heard this is here,

749
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:15,840
I wanted to take a photo on bamboo bridge

750
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:17,074
and ride that before we go.

751
00:32:17,074 --> 00:32:18,707
- Something to ride? / - That looks so hot.

752
00:32:18,707 --> 00:32:20,140
- A swing. / - Something's so...

753
00:32:20,140 --> 00:32:21,707
- That's a swing? / - It's a swing.

754
00:32:21,707 --> 00:32:23,140
- What? / - That's a swing?

755
00:32:23,140 --> 00:32:24,674
It's really fun.

756
00:32:24,674 --> 00:32:26,707
- I thought it was a windmill. / - It looks like a windmill.

757
00:32:26,707 --> 00:32:27,974
This is the highlight of Pai.

758
00:32:27,974 --> 00:32:29,774
We went there for that swing.

759
00:32:29,774 --> 00:32:31,140
How do we ride this?

760
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:32,407
Usually, well...

761
00:32:33,974 --> 00:32:35,540
Photo service.

762
00:32:35,540 --> 00:32:37,274
Does it mean they take photos for us?

763
00:32:37,274 --> 00:32:38,840
- Shouldn't there be an owner? / - That's probably right.

764
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:45,607
(They can't understand what it says)

765
00:32:45,607 --> 00:32:49,374
There they are. They're over there.

766
00:32:49,507 --> 00:32:51,007
Let's ask them.

767
00:32:51,007 --> 00:32:53,107
- How much is it? / - It's 30 baht.

768
00:32:53,107 --> 00:32:54,240
- 30? / - Let's ride this.

769
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:56,707
How much is that? $1?

770
00:32:56,707 --> 00:32:58,307
- That? / - 30 baht?

771
00:32:58,307 --> 00:32:59,940
It's $1 per ride.

772
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:01,807
Let's go then.

773
00:33:01,807 --> 00:33:02,840
$1 for 3 spins?

774
00:33:04,340 --> 00:33:05,574
Is it operated by hands?

775
00:33:05,574 --> 00:33:07,907
- And you only go around 3 times? / - Yes.

776
00:33:07,907 --> 00:33:10,074
It depends on their mood.

777
00:33:10,074 --> 00:33:11,774
They give you more turns if they're in a good mood.

778
00:33:11,774 --> 00:33:13,607
I think Pai is all about how you communicate.

779
00:33:13,607 --> 00:33:17,340
It's just like at the amusement park, "One more time."

780
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:20,607
No, that can't be a highlight of Thailand.

781
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:23,440
No matter how much I think about it...

782
00:33:25,274 --> 00:33:27,507
I see. That's how they do it. Is this safe?

783
00:33:27,507 --> 00:33:29,607
Isn't it dangerous? Is it okay?

784
00:33:29,607 --> 00:33:32,807
Get on.

785
00:33:32,807 --> 00:33:33,640
Wait a minute.

786
00:33:34,340 --> 00:33:37,374
(Hongbin gets on the swing first)

787
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:39,474
(Feeling anxious)

788
00:33:39,807 --> 00:33:43,640
(He's ready when the seatbelt is put on)

789
00:33:44,107 --> 00:33:45,374
Wait. Is it starting?

790
00:33:45,374 --> 00:33:46,807
That's really scary.

791
00:33:46,807 --> 00:33:48,374
- What's that? / - It was so scary at first.

792
00:33:48,374 --> 00:33:50,440
- I bet that's scary. / - It is scary.

793
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:53,040
- It's like the Viking. / - You must be heavy.

794
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:53,907
I guess so.

795
00:33:53,907 --> 00:33:55,540
- I have to get on too. / - I got on first...

796
00:33:55,540 --> 00:33:57,407
- Oh, no. / - They're struggling.

797
00:33:57,407 --> 00:33:59,340
I don't think I should get on.

798
00:33:59,907 --> 00:34:02,740
(Please wait for a bit)

799
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:04,640
This is scary.

800
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:06,640
Is it scary? Is it?

801
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:08,374
It's scary?

802
00:34:08,374 --> 00:34:10,040
It's not as scary as you'd think.

803
00:34:10,507 --> 00:34:13,240
(He can't process anything)

804
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:15,907
- Wow. / - I get on?

805
00:34:18,074 --> 00:34:19,207
Oh, please.

806
00:34:19,207 --> 00:34:23,140
- Please don't make it scary. / - It's for kids.

807
00:34:23,140 --> 00:34:25,240
Did you see the way he just tied the seatbelt?

808
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:28,907
It's a safety ribbon.

809
00:34:28,907 --> 00:34:30,440
A pretty ribbon.

810
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:31,674
Safety ribbon!

811
00:34:33,774 --> 00:34:36,640
Wait a minute.

812
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:38,607
That looks so scary.

813
00:34:38,607 --> 00:34:41,707
- Is it scary? / - It's really scary.

814
00:34:41,707 --> 00:34:44,707
All the locals are here.

815
00:34:46,307 --> 00:34:48,507
I think they're the first customers.

816
00:34:48,507 --> 00:34:49,907
- Hongbin. / - Yeah?

817
00:34:49,907 --> 00:34:52,274
This is scary! Why did you say it wasn't?

818
00:34:52,274 --> 00:34:53,540
It's not scary if you stay still.

819
00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:55,407
I hate this kind of ride.

820
00:34:56,407 --> 00:34:58,240
Even though I suggested riding this.

821
00:34:58,940 --> 00:35:01,274
- Slowly, slowly. / - It's like those old rides.

822
00:35:01,274 --> 00:35:03,774
- That spinning thing. / - That's right.

823
00:35:03,774 --> 00:35:06,307
- The old man would bring it. / - Wait a minute.

824
00:35:07,407 --> 00:35:08,707
It's fast. It's fast.

825
00:35:10,540 --> 00:35:11,240
This is fun.

826
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:12,440
It's higher than you'd think.

827
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:14,774
- The world is turning with me. / - It's all manual.

828
00:35:16,407 --> 00:35:17,874
It's high.

829
00:35:17,874 --> 00:35:21,874
(N is still getting used to the height)

830
00:35:22,340 --> 00:35:24,140
I think that's more than 3 turns.

831
00:35:24,140 --> 00:35:26,840
They gave us more turns. They were in a good mood.

832
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:29,140
Because you had good reactions.

833
00:35:29,140 --> 00:35:31,707
- He liked us. / - I feel secure now.

834
00:35:31,707 --> 00:35:34,374
(The owner is having fun watching N ride the swing)

835
00:35:34,374 --> 00:35:36,707
And this guy really likes me.

836
00:35:38,074 --> 00:35:40,040
And this guy really likes me.

837
00:35:41,374 --> 00:35:43,507
He gives me a high-five when I pass through.

838
00:35:44,374 --> 00:35:46,107
High-five.

839
00:35:49,507 --> 00:35:51,874
(Perfectly adjusted)

840
00:35:51,874 --> 00:35:54,807
Why would you ride that all the way there?

841
00:35:54,807 --> 00:35:57,840
He just built it for his grandchildren.

842
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:58,207
Exactly.

843
00:35:58,207 --> 00:36:01,207
But tourists kept asking if they could ride it.

844
00:36:01,207 --> 00:36:03,307
And he can't do it for free

845
00:36:03,307 --> 00:36:05,240
so he decided to take $1 per ride.

846
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:06,574
That's what happened.

847
00:36:06,574 --> 00:36:08,807
They're the first customers.

848
00:36:08,807 --> 00:36:11,674
It looks like it's for kids but it's actually fun.

849
00:36:11,674 --> 00:36:13,674
That was for his grandchildren.

850
00:36:13,674 --> 00:36:14,740
Instead of through a monitor,

851
00:36:14,740 --> 00:36:17,007
I'm watching this with my eyes.

852
00:36:17,007 --> 00:36:18,140
This is beautiful.

853
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:20,574
Here I go.

854
00:36:20,574 --> 00:36:24,007
(N is composed enough to admire the surroundings)

855
00:36:25,140 --> 00:36:28,740
(You can see the entire view of bamboo bridge)

856
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:31,540
(Hi)

857
00:36:32,540 --> 00:36:33,874
(Hi)

858
00:36:35,574 --> 00:36:40,074
(You can enjoy the scenery in the dry season)

859
00:36:42,007 --> 00:36:44,107
- Cafe. / - That place was great.

860
00:36:45,740 --> 00:36:48,274
(18 minutes from bamboo bridge to cafe)

861
00:36:48,274 --> 00:36:51,140
It's good that it's not too far on scooters.

862
00:36:51,140 --> 00:36:53,240
It's close.

863
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:55,207
It's good that you hired the two-seater.

864
00:36:55,207 --> 00:36:56,974
- It's convenient. / - You're right.

865
00:36:56,974 --> 00:37:00,274
One of the places where one must take photos in Pai.

866
00:37:00,274 --> 00:37:02,174
We can take great photos here

867
00:37:02,174 --> 00:37:04,274
and drink cool beverages.

868
00:37:04,274 --> 00:37:05,674
That's what this is for.

869
00:37:05,674 --> 00:37:06,907
Look at that.

870
00:37:08,540 --> 00:37:09,774
Isn't this great?

871
00:37:10,940 --> 00:37:12,774
The decor of the place was great.

872
00:37:14,174 --> 00:37:15,574
That's cute.

873
00:37:15,940 --> 00:37:18,507
- What are we looking at? / - It's kind of like Korea.

874
00:37:18,507 --> 00:37:19,740
Doesn't it look like Gapyeong?

875
00:37:19,740 --> 00:37:21,440
You can't find that in Gapyeong.

876
00:37:23,574 --> 00:37:25,474
1, 2, 3.

877
00:37:25,707 --> 00:37:27,774
1, 2, 3.

878
00:37:27,774 --> 00:37:31,440
(N refuses to look ordinary with his poses)

879
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:33,174
It looks like an amusement park.

880
00:37:34,007 --> 00:37:37,540
- The colors are pretty. / - The colors are really pretty.

881
00:37:37,540 --> 00:37:38,874
The photos turned out so nice.

882
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:40,974
Pretty.

883
00:37:40,974 --> 00:37:46,707
(When they enter the 2nd floor of the cafe)

884
00:37:47,907 --> 00:37:49,774
It looks cute, cozy and pretty.

885
00:37:49,774 --> 00:37:52,440
When I was a kid, I wanted to ride that kind of swing.

886
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:55,607
Those rocking chairs.

887
00:37:55,607 --> 00:37:56,840
That's great.

888
00:37:58,274 --> 00:38:00,974
Look at the outlets. You can hang out here all day

889
00:38:00,974 --> 00:38:02,540
with your laptop.

890
00:38:02,540 --> 00:38:03,774
On those cushions,

891
00:38:03,774 --> 00:38:06,240
a lot of people come here and take a nap.

892
00:38:06,940 --> 00:38:09,974
Look at the people over there.

893
00:38:09,974 --> 00:38:11,340
- They're just reading books. / - They're relaxing.

894
00:38:11,340 --> 00:38:12,974
They're just taking rest.

895
00:38:12,974 --> 00:38:17,374
People who lead a busy lives

896
00:38:17,374 --> 00:38:20,307
can come here and relax.

897
00:38:20,307 --> 00:38:21,640
It's a good place to zone out.

898
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:23,307
Right. We can just sit here.

899
00:38:23,307 --> 00:38:26,507
This is a place where people come to do nothing.

900
00:38:26,507 --> 00:38:27,874
It's here.

901
00:38:29,674 --> 00:38:31,774
- Thank you. / - Thank you.

902
00:38:31,774 --> 00:38:33,707
That was so good.

903
00:38:33,707 --> 00:38:36,540
(What did they order?)

904
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:41,707
(Passion fruit and mango, Thai tea, $2.30 each)

905
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:44,040
I think the prices are about the same.

906
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:45,274
- As Myanmar? / - Yes.

907
00:38:45,274 --> 00:38:48,174
- Minus the lodging. / - The accommodation is different.

908
00:38:48,174 --> 00:38:51,340
They slept at the airport, not at a hotel.

909
00:38:52,307 --> 00:38:54,107
- We got on the hot air balloon. / - Right.

910
00:38:54,107 --> 00:38:56,474
Our team rode the swing instead.

911
00:38:56,474 --> 00:38:58,007
- Swing. / - You're right.

912
00:38:58,007 --> 00:38:59,740
We experienced a hot air balloon,

913
00:38:59,740 --> 00:39:00,607
they experienced a swing.

914
00:39:00,607 --> 00:39:01,540
A swing.

915
00:39:01,540 --> 00:39:04,574
(Passion fruit and mango, Thai tea, $2.30 each)

916
00:39:04,974 --> 00:39:07,007
This is really delicious. Try this first.

917
00:39:15,274 --> 00:39:17,574
- This tastes like coffee. / - It's good, right?

918
00:39:17,574 --> 00:39:19,374
- Milk tea. / - It is milk tea.

919
00:39:19,374 --> 00:39:20,740
The Thai tea was really sweet.

920
00:39:20,740 --> 00:39:23,874
Condensed milk, sugar, milk and black tea.

921
00:39:23,874 --> 00:39:26,440
It's savory and sweet.

922
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:28,407
You can taste the milk and the milk tea.

923
00:39:28,407 --> 00:39:30,007
It's a charming taste.

924
00:39:30,007 --> 00:39:32,807
This is a bit sour but also sweet.

925
00:39:33,807 --> 00:39:36,040
Having a cool drink in a hot country is the best.

926
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:39,707
This is delicious.

927
00:39:39,707 --> 00:39:41,907
- It's... / - You shouldn't drink this before this.

928
00:39:41,907 --> 00:39:44,007
- Since this is sweet, this tastes sour. / - Right.

929
00:39:44,007 --> 00:39:46,774
If you drink this first, then this...

930
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:51,340
(The flavor makes him nod)

931
00:39:51,774 --> 00:39:53,307
This is my style.

932
00:39:53,307 --> 00:39:56,474
Looking at the people here,

933
00:39:56,474 --> 00:39:57,974
it seems like in order to enjoy Pai,

934
00:39:57,974 --> 00:39:59,074
you need to lay back.

935
00:40:00,907 --> 00:40:03,207
The view was beautiful there.

936
00:40:03,207 --> 00:40:05,107
Pai is where backpackers

937
00:40:05,107 --> 00:40:07,674
stay for like a month to relax.

938
00:40:07,674 --> 00:40:08,307
Many foreigners do that.

939
00:40:08,307 --> 00:40:10,140
Europeans stay for a month.

940
00:40:10,140 --> 00:40:11,840
A month just in Pai?

941
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:13,540
This is so comfortable.

942
00:40:14,374 --> 00:40:16,407
The drink cools my body too.

943
00:40:17,207 --> 00:40:27,640
(They take a short break before their next itinerary)

944
00:40:30,874 --> 00:40:32,940
(Now it's time to travel again)

945
00:40:32,940 --> 00:40:34,240
Now...

946
00:40:34,740 --> 00:40:36,574
We need to go to the next spot.

947
00:40:36,574 --> 00:40:38,307
- Are you sure there's next spot? / - Of course.

948
00:40:38,307 --> 00:40:40,074
You're not just improvising, right?

949
00:40:40,074 --> 00:40:41,440
No. I'm always prepared.

950
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:43,107
- I prepared the next spot. / - Where are we going?

951
00:40:43,107 --> 00:40:45,507
Next... We had a good rest here.

952
00:40:45,507 --> 00:40:47,340
We saw great scenery and

953
00:40:47,340 --> 00:40:48,940
took nice pictures.

954
00:40:48,940 --> 00:40:50,774
It's time to rest our bodies now.

955
00:40:50,774 --> 00:40:52,907
- Rest more? / - Hot spring.

956
00:40:53,507 --> 00:40:54,807
There's a hot spring?

957
00:40:54,807 --> 00:40:56,440
There's a hot spring in Thailand?

958
00:40:57,174 --> 00:40:59,174
(Tuhi Trip, day 1 in Pai)

959
00:40:59,174 --> 00:41:01,907
(Natural hot spring)

960
00:41:02,540 --> 00:41:06,940
(8 minutes from cafe to hot spring)

961
00:41:08,474 --> 00:41:11,274
Ta-da. We're now at a hot spring

962
00:41:11,274 --> 00:41:13,940
that is loved by the locals as well.

963
00:41:13,940 --> 00:41:15,840
It's a natural hot spring.

964
00:41:16,507 --> 00:41:19,707
What if it's dried up like

965
00:41:19,707 --> 00:41:20,974
the bamboo bridge earlier?

966
00:41:20,974 --> 00:41:23,940
What we need to remember is the ground...

967
00:41:24,874 --> 00:41:26,774
And then the swing.

968
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:29,807
Now there's the valley?

969
00:41:29,807 --> 00:41:33,307
The ground and the water? I see.

970
00:41:33,307 --> 00:41:35,207
Isn't it interesting that the people go to hot springs

971
00:41:35,207 --> 00:41:36,674
even though it's hot?

972
00:41:36,674 --> 00:41:37,874
You can fight heat with heat.

973
00:41:38,540 --> 00:41:40,474
Look. The people are in the hot spring.

974
00:41:42,907 --> 00:41:44,474
Wow... They're just... Wow...

975
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:47,640
It seems like you can just go in there.

976
00:41:48,507 --> 00:41:51,074
- It's just on the street. / - What is that?

977
00:41:51,074 --> 00:41:52,574
Isn't that just a pond?

978
00:41:52,574 --> 00:41:56,407
- Come on. A pond? / - The water there is so warm.

979
00:41:56,407 --> 00:41:59,040
- It's warm? / - It's a hot spring.

980
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:00,574
That's fascinating.

981
00:42:00,574 --> 00:42:01,807
It's a natural hot spring.

982
00:42:01,807 --> 00:42:03,740
- It's 36℃? / - Yes.

983
00:42:03,740 --> 00:42:04,774
How is the water so warm?

984
00:42:04,774 --> 00:42:07,840
The higher you go, the warmer the water becomes.

985
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:12,907
(The entrance fee is $10.40 per person)

986
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:17,440
- Shall we go? / - Yes.

987
00:42:18,407 --> 00:42:20,774
Everyone puts their bags down.

988
00:42:20,774 --> 00:42:22,974
Let's put the bags here.

989
00:42:22,974 --> 00:42:24,240
Take the socks off too.

990
00:42:28,674 --> 00:42:30,207
Hey, it's hot.

991
00:42:30,207 --> 00:42:31,807
It's hotter here.

992
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:35,940
It's like a bath.

993
00:42:39,140 --> 00:42:41,774
It looks just like a valley from the outside, right?

994
00:42:41,774 --> 00:42:43,240
But it's really hot inside.

995
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:44,840
It's very hot.

996
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:47,907
- It looks cold though. / - I know. From here it does.

997
00:42:48,540 --> 00:42:54,074
(The temperature of the water is about 36℃)

998
00:42:54,507 --> 00:42:56,307
It's just like a hot bath.

999
00:42:56,307 --> 00:42:58,574
I didn't know it could be this hot.

1000
00:42:58,574 --> 00:42:59,540
This is interesting.

1001
00:43:01,907 --> 00:43:06,274
I think this place is where you can just relax.

1002
00:43:07,374 --> 00:43:08,240
Should we go in further?

1003
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:09,940
There are many places like this.

1004
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:12,607
It's hot.

1005
00:43:13,374 --> 00:43:14,640
It's so hot.

1006
00:43:15,574 --> 00:43:21,007
(N and Hongbin enjoy the leisurely bath)

1007
00:43:21,007 --> 00:43:22,740
That must feel good.

1008
00:43:23,207 --> 00:43:25,307
It's really nice there.

1009
00:43:25,307 --> 00:43:27,607
This is my first time being in a natural hot spring.

1010
00:43:27,607 --> 00:43:29,640
I haven't been to a public hot spring like this.

1011
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:30,874
This place is very famous.

1012
00:43:30,874 --> 00:43:33,540
I heard you must visit this place when you're in Pai.

1013
00:43:33,540 --> 00:43:36,940
I wasn't sure if you could enjoy it in this hot weather

1014
00:43:36,940 --> 00:43:39,174
but it's actually quite nice.

1015
00:43:39,174 --> 00:43:40,840
It's hot but nice.

1016
00:43:41,940 --> 00:43:43,974
It's not as hot as I imagined.

1017
00:43:43,974 --> 00:43:46,740
(Just sitting here makes them feel comfortable)

1018
00:43:46,740 --> 00:43:52,140
(It's where everybody takes a rest)

1019
00:43:55,707 --> 00:43:57,074
(What are you doing now?)

1020
00:43:57,074 --> 00:43:58,840
Hey! Push me!

1021
00:43:59,540 --> 00:44:01,774
You can't fall forward.

1022
00:44:01,774 --> 00:44:03,074
Since we're not doing anything.

1023
00:44:03,907 --> 00:44:05,174
Let's play the pushing game and

1024
00:44:05,174 --> 00:44:07,340
it's an automatic penalty if you lose.

1025
00:44:07,340 --> 00:44:08,440
It's automatic.

1026
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:10,807
Are you sure you can beat me? I'm older than you.

1027
00:44:11,340 --> 00:44:12,407
Of course.

1028
00:44:12,407 --> 00:44:14,007
I'm the leader, you know.

1029
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:17,674
(That's how it began)

1030
00:44:18,140 --> 00:44:20,340
(Hongbin)

1031
00:44:21,074 --> 00:44:22,707
(N)

1032
00:44:23,207 --> 00:44:26,940
(The pushing game)

1033
00:44:27,574 --> 00:44:29,674
Don't fall toward me!

1034
00:44:29,674 --> 00:44:31,440
Don't fall this way!

1035
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:33,140
- Fall that way! / - I didn't fall.

1036
00:44:33,140 --> 00:44:34,640
1, 2, 3.

1037
00:44:35,874 --> 00:44:36,740
(Danger)

1038
00:44:36,740 --> 00:44:37,640
(Saves himself)

1039
00:44:37,640 --> 00:44:39,607
You are sly.

1040
00:44:39,607 --> 00:44:41,874
You can't be so sly in this place of healing.

1041
00:44:42,474 --> 00:44:44,874
They have great teamwork.

1042
00:44:46,307 --> 00:44:47,340
1, 2, 3.

1043
00:44:47,340 --> 00:44:50,874
(This one clap will decide everything)

1044
00:44:50,874 --> 00:44:52,840
- That was a strong push. / - He's falling.

1045
00:44:53,307 --> 00:44:54,607
(Hongbin's good at getting his balance)

1046
00:44:54,607 --> 00:44:56,340
Hongbin is in danger.

1047
00:44:58,007 --> 00:44:58,740
1, 2, 3.

1048
00:44:58,740 --> 00:45:01,074
(Hongbin's good at getting his balance)

1049
00:45:01,074 --> 00:45:03,874
(Hongbin's bad at getting his balance)

1050
00:45:03,874 --> 00:45:07,674
(A big splash for Hongbin)

1051
00:45:07,674 --> 00:45:09,774
That's what we did.

1052
00:45:09,774 --> 00:45:11,074
What is this?

1053
00:45:12,607 --> 00:45:13,874
You can eat it.

1054
00:45:14,940 --> 00:45:17,840
I think we can splash the water.

1055
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:18,974
Hey! It's hot!

1056
00:45:18,974 --> 00:45:22,307
(His revenge was successful)

1057
00:45:22,307 --> 00:45:23,907
(His revenge failed)

1058
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:26,274
(Since they're soaked anyway, they go nuts)

1059
00:45:26,274 --> 00:45:28,040
The water tastes like something.

1060
00:45:28,574 --> 00:45:30,740
You can taste the water? Drink then!

1061
00:45:33,574 --> 00:45:34,907
My bleached hair...

1062
00:45:34,907 --> 00:45:36,207
Should we play one more game?

1063
00:45:36,207 --> 00:45:39,207
The loser... They sell a special food here.

1064
00:45:39,207 --> 00:45:40,240
The loser goes and buys it.

1065
00:45:40,907 --> 00:45:43,040
(Feigned laughter)

1066
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:43,874
One more time?

1067
00:45:43,874 --> 00:45:45,907
My hair is bleached so my roots look terrible.

1068
00:45:46,807 --> 00:45:50,074
(They cheer for each other)

1069
00:45:50,074 --> 00:45:52,574
Let's cheer for ourselves with a clap. 1, 2, 3.

1070
00:45:52,940 --> 00:45:54,340
(Again?)

1071
00:45:54,807 --> 00:45:56,507
Oh, no.

1072
00:45:57,007 --> 00:45:58,107
He's sly.

1073
00:45:58,874 --> 00:46:01,774
- He's so sly. / - He's so sly.

1074
00:46:01,774 --> 00:46:04,507
Isn't this healing? Is it killing?

1075
00:46:05,340 --> 00:46:06,674
- That looked like killing. / - Okay.

1076
00:46:06,674 --> 00:46:08,007
Let's cheer for each other.

1077
00:46:08,007 --> 00:46:09,207
1, 2, 3.

1078
00:46:10,140 --> 00:46:12,640
- Hey. / - I learned it from you.

1079
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:14,807
It's normal to learn from your elders.

1080
00:46:15,274 --> 00:46:16,774
1, 2, 3.

1081
00:46:18,507 --> 00:46:21,640
I hope Hongbin wins this time.

1082
00:46:25,374 --> 00:46:26,507
Die.

1083
00:46:26,507 --> 00:46:27,274
(Hongbin loses the game again)

1084
00:46:27,274 --> 00:46:28,640
Did you tell me to die?

1085
00:46:29,674 --> 00:46:31,474
That's why you won.

1086
00:46:31,474 --> 00:46:34,407
You played to kill me. That's why you won.

1087
00:46:34,407 --> 00:46:35,340
Die.

1088
00:46:35,340 --> 00:46:40,507
(Hongbin loses the game again)

1089
00:46:40,507 --> 00:46:41,607
Go on.

1090
00:46:42,674 --> 00:46:43,440
He lost again.

1091
00:46:44,207 --> 00:46:46,040
Just buy it for him.

1092
00:46:47,607 --> 00:46:50,774
I can't believe I played against such a sly guy.

1093
00:46:51,274 --> 00:46:53,374
(Regret)

1094
00:46:53,774 --> 00:46:55,540
I don't think this is a healing trip.

1095
00:46:56,340 --> 00:47:00,707
I feel like... Are we getting closer?

1096
00:47:01,840 --> 00:47:03,174
Oh, that?

1097
00:47:04,840 --> 00:47:06,174
Sawadikap.

1098
00:47:06,674 --> 00:47:08,074
Oh, egg.

1099
00:47:08,074 --> 00:47:09,240
- Egg? / - Egg.

1100
00:47:09,774 --> 00:47:11,774
- They sell eggs there too? / - Yes.

1101
00:47:11,774 --> 00:47:12,774
That's fascinating.

1102
00:47:12,774 --> 00:47:15,507
The upper stream temperature is over 100℃.

1103
00:47:15,507 --> 00:47:17,640
So you can cook it up there.

1104
00:47:19,674 --> 00:47:21,174
Thank you.

1105
00:47:22,674 --> 00:47:26,574
It's an egg. Is it cooked?

1106
00:47:26,574 --> 00:47:27,807
Are they not cooked?

1107
00:47:27,807 --> 00:47:29,507
This egg live?

1108
00:47:30,940 --> 00:47:31,874
No?

1109
00:47:33,207 --> 00:47:34,974
(You can go up there)

1110
00:47:34,974 --> 00:47:35,774
Self?

1111
00:47:36,540 --> 00:47:38,274
(Go there and put the basket in the water)

1112
00:47:38,274 --> 00:47:40,474
I put the whole basket in the water. I see.

1113
00:47:40,907 --> 00:47:43,740
I'll tell N they're cooked already.

1114
00:47:44,840 --> 00:47:46,374
I'll tell him to try them.

1115
00:47:48,107 --> 00:47:48,940
I'm happy.

1116
00:47:50,307 --> 00:47:51,840
Why do you look so happy?

1117
00:47:51,840 --> 00:47:53,307
I was so happy.

1118
00:47:54,174 --> 00:47:55,574
- Did you buy it? / - Yes.

1119
00:47:57,407 --> 00:47:58,840
They sell boiled eggs.

1120
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:03,974
I heard there's a place where we can boil the eggs.

1121
00:48:03,974 --> 00:48:05,240
- There's a place? / - Yes.

1122
00:48:05,240 --> 00:48:07,074
So you buy them...

1123
00:48:07,074 --> 00:48:10,374
You could boil them here if it was hot enough.

1124
00:48:10,374 --> 00:48:12,607
So there's another place to boil the eggs.

1125
00:48:12,607 --> 00:48:14,007
- It's up there? / - Yes.

1126
00:48:14,007 --> 00:48:15,674
She said these were boiled eggs.

1127
00:48:15,674 --> 00:48:17,374
So we can eat them just like that?

1128
00:48:17,374 --> 00:48:19,807
I thought he knew it. I could see him flustered

1129
00:48:19,807 --> 00:48:22,540
They usually sell raw eggs.

1130
00:48:22,540 --> 00:48:26,474
People usually buy raw eggs and cook them up there.

1131
00:48:26,474 --> 00:48:28,440
Rock, paper, scissors and loser cracks it on his head?

1132
00:48:29,374 --> 00:48:30,940
Rock, paper, scissors and loser cracks it on his head?

1133
00:48:30,940 --> 00:48:34,207
I realized I'd dug a hole for myself.

1134
00:48:34,207 --> 00:48:35,974
- If you don't play, you lose... / - Wait, wait, wait.

1135
00:48:37,740 --> 00:48:39,007
I've got it.

1136
00:48:39,007 --> 00:48:40,240
You've lost.

1137
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:42,440
You just can't win this.

1138
00:48:42,440 --> 00:48:43,774
If you don't play, you lose. Rock, paper, scissors.

1139
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:48,340
Oh, no.

1140
00:48:48,340 --> 00:48:50,107
You just do it. I feel bad.

1141
00:48:50,107 --> 00:48:51,607
It's okay. It's a game.

1142
00:48:51,607 --> 00:48:53,507
I think it's better if you just crack it.

1143
00:48:53,507 --> 00:48:55,607
- Why? / - I feel bad.

1144
00:48:56,207 --> 00:48:58,340
- Are you trying to make me look bad? / - Why?

1145
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:00,240
Earlier you...

1146
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:02,140
It's okay. I lost twice.

1147
00:49:02,140 --> 00:49:03,274
It's really okay.

1148
00:49:03,874 --> 00:49:04,974
No, no.

1149
00:49:04,974 --> 00:49:07,940
- Are you sure? / - I really had no idea.

1150
00:49:09,940 --> 00:49:11,907
Look at his face. He feels really bad.

1151
00:49:11,907 --> 00:49:13,507
Count to three before you hit me.

1152
00:49:13,507 --> 00:49:15,574
- N, this is a variety show, right? / - Yes.

1153
00:49:15,574 --> 00:49:18,007
1, 2, 3.

1154
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:24,474
What is this?

1155
00:49:25,507 --> 00:49:27,840
That was for real.

1156
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:29,374
That wasn't fake.

1157
00:49:30,674 --> 00:49:32,807
I've never seen N glare like that.

1158
00:49:32,807 --> 00:49:34,540
What is this?

1159
00:49:34,540 --> 00:49:36,840
I told you to do it yourself.

1160
00:49:37,940 --> 00:49:40,274
(Can't stop laughing)

1161
00:49:41,507 --> 00:49:43,474
Done? Is it out?

1162
00:49:43,474 --> 00:49:45,340
Okay, then.

1163
00:49:45,340 --> 00:49:47,374
I'm completely satisfied with this trip now.

1164
00:49:47,374 --> 00:49:49,807
Rock, paper, scissors and crack it again.

1165
00:49:49,807 --> 00:49:53,174
There's a place where we can cook the eggs up there.

1166
00:49:53,174 --> 00:49:53,940
Cook them for real?

1167
00:49:53,940 --> 00:49:55,874
Yes, for real.

1168
00:49:56,474 --> 00:49:58,507
Let's go cook them for real, Hongbin.

1169
00:49:58,507 --> 00:50:00,774
- You almost froze me. / - His eyes have changed.

1170
00:50:01,974 --> 00:50:03,740
- Let's hurry. / - Go, go, go.

1171
00:50:03,740 --> 00:50:07,240
(Let's go cook the eggs)

1172
00:50:08,040 --> 00:50:13,874
(After 5 minutes of walking, they reach the spot)

1173
00:50:13,874 --> 00:50:15,807
It's there.

1174
00:50:17,174 --> 00:50:19,240
(Tha Pai Hot Spring)

1175
00:50:19,240 --> 00:50:21,140
- That's fascinating. / - Because it's hot.

1176
00:50:21,140 --> 00:50:22,674
It's 80℃.

1177
00:50:22,674 --> 00:50:25,540
(Rain seeps into the ground and becomes heated)

1178
00:50:25,540 --> 00:50:28,174
(It comes back up to the surface to form the hot spring)

1179
00:50:30,040 --> 00:50:33,507
(He hangs the egg basket on the bamboo stick)

1180
00:50:33,507 --> 00:50:37,774
(Then places it in the hot spring)

1181
00:50:38,607 --> 00:50:39,607
Me too.

1182
00:50:39,607 --> 00:50:42,574
You leave it in the hot spring.

1183
00:50:45,074 --> 00:50:46,574
The hottest place.

1184
00:50:48,274 --> 00:50:50,407
You must be running a business here.

1185
00:50:50,407 --> 00:50:52,640
15 minutes would be perfect.

1186
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:55,374
You can't go into that hot spring. It's too hot.

1187
00:50:55,374 --> 00:50:57,540
- You could really get hurt. / - Take it out.

1188
00:50:58,907 --> 00:51:01,140
Want to crack it on your own head this time?

1189
00:51:01,607 --> 00:51:03,607
No, I'll crack it on your head.

1190
00:51:04,574 --> 00:51:06,840
What if it's not cooked?

1191
00:51:06,840 --> 00:51:07,940
It's cooked.

1192
00:51:07,940 --> 00:51:10,707
Soft-boiled eggs are the best.

1193
00:51:10,707 --> 00:51:12,707
- That looks tasty. / - Hot, hot.

1194
00:51:15,574 --> 00:51:18,607
(2 precious eggs are left after missing 1 egg)

1195
00:51:19,007 --> 00:51:20,507
Should we eat them now?

1196
00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:23,140
- Be careful. It's hot. / - It must be hot.

1197
00:51:23,640 --> 00:51:24,974
It's so hot. Hang on.

1198
00:51:26,340 --> 00:51:27,374
It's cooked.

1199
00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:30,174
It's really hot.

1200
00:51:30,174 --> 00:51:31,874
I can't believe it can be this hot.

1201
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:36,074
When it's too hot, do this. Since my shirt is wet.

1202
00:51:39,640 --> 00:51:42,840
- If you peel this... / - This is good. I was hungry.

1203
00:51:42,840 --> 00:51:46,007
Today's product is an egg iron.

1204
00:51:47,640 --> 00:51:50,240
It irons clothes very well.

1205
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:52,007
It straightens creases with ease.

1206
00:51:52,007 --> 00:51:55,107
It's round in shape, so you can iron anywhere.

1207
00:51:55,107 --> 00:51:56,507
Like this.

1208
00:51:57,474 --> 00:51:58,707
It's cooled now.

1209
00:51:58,707 --> 00:52:00,107
I played along nicely, right?

1210
00:52:00,107 --> 00:52:01,240
- Wasn't it natural? / - Yes, very natural.

1211
00:52:01,240 --> 00:52:02,740
Did I seem young?

1212
00:52:02,740 --> 00:52:05,040
- Shall we? On your head? / - No.

1213
00:52:06,207 --> 00:52:08,007
- What are you on about? / - Okay, okay.

1214
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:12,774
(When they crack open the pudding-like eggs)

1215
00:52:12,774 --> 00:52:14,207
It peels so easily.

1216
00:52:14,840 --> 00:52:17,074
Those who like soft-boiled eggs would love this.

1217
00:52:18,407 --> 00:52:20,407
(It's hot)

1218
00:52:20,607 --> 00:52:22,807
(He gives it to Hongbin first)

1219
00:52:24,440 --> 00:52:25,907
It's delicious.

1220
00:52:25,907 --> 00:52:26,807
Soft-boiled.

1221
00:52:27,240 --> 00:52:28,907
It tasted like pudding.

1222
00:52:29,574 --> 00:52:32,140
How good would it be after the hot spring?

1223
00:52:32,140 --> 00:52:33,674
It looks so delicious.

1224
00:52:37,007 --> 00:52:37,774
Delicious.

1225
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:39,840
The yolk is good.

1226
00:52:41,007 --> 00:52:43,540
Right?

1227
00:52:48,007 --> 00:52:51,040
Now that we've had fun here,

1228
00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:54,474
we're going to the last spot. We must visit there.

1229
00:52:54,474 --> 00:52:57,874
We've been to rather small and cozy places so far.

1230
00:52:57,874 --> 00:53:00,940
But this place is very open.

1231
00:53:00,940 --> 00:53:02,574
You'll feel refreshed there.

1232
00:53:02,574 --> 00:53:03,840
Is it broad there?

1233
00:53:03,840 --> 00:53:06,440
Broad? Broad?

1234
00:53:06,440 --> 00:53:08,274
It's just a very big place.

1235
00:53:08,274 --> 00:53:10,074
It's broad and big.

1236
00:53:10,074 --> 00:53:12,240
It's a good place to wrap up your day.

1237
00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:15,007
- Let's go there right away. / - Let's go.

1238
00:53:19,074 --> 00:53:21,574
(What you see when you search for Pai online)

1239
00:53:21,574 --> 00:53:22,674
Is this the place?

1240
00:53:22,674 --> 00:53:24,240
This is the place.

1241
00:53:25,540 --> 00:53:26,940
You're finally going there.

1242
00:53:27,940 --> 00:53:29,174
It's unique.

1243
00:53:29,174 --> 00:53:31,007
(Pai Canyon is a famous photo spot)

1244
00:53:31,074 --> 00:53:33,574
(Tuhi Trip, day 1 in Pai)

1245
00:53:33,574 --> 00:53:34,274
(Pai Canyon)

1246
00:53:34,274 --> 00:53:36,440
This is the main place in Pai.

1247
00:53:36,440 --> 00:53:39,174
- It's not so far either. / - Yes, it's nearby.

1248
00:53:39,507 --> 00:53:41,874
It would be so much fun to travel by bike...

1249
00:53:41,874 --> 00:53:43,407
- With your significant other. / - It'd be so nice.

1250
00:53:43,407 --> 00:53:45,374
- So much fun. / - We must hurry.

1251
00:53:45,374 --> 00:53:47,407
- Because... / - The sun's going down.

1252
00:53:47,407 --> 00:53:49,140
- We can't miss the sunset. / - It's going down.

1253
00:53:49,140 --> 00:53:50,907
We can't miss this.

1254
00:53:50,907 --> 00:53:51,474
Run.

1255
00:53:51,474 --> 00:53:53,307
You're going to see the sunset.

1256
00:53:53,307 --> 00:53:56,040
We couldn't miss this. It's the final destination.

1257
00:53:56,940 --> 00:53:58,140
Goodness.

1258
00:53:59,407 --> 00:54:00,474
This is exhausting.

1259
00:54:00,474 --> 00:54:02,207
They have to climb up before the sun sets.

1260
00:54:02,207 --> 00:54:04,474
This is where you see the sunset.

1261
00:54:05,174 --> 00:54:07,340
Oh, no. The sun is going down.

1262
00:54:07,340 --> 00:54:09,274
This is so exhausting.

1263
00:54:09,274 --> 00:54:12,907
In Thailand, the sun sets at 6:30 p.m. in April.

1264
00:54:12,907 --> 00:54:15,507
So we had to hurry

1265
00:54:15,507 --> 00:54:16,874
to see the sunset.

1266
00:54:18,674 --> 00:54:20,007
Entrance is free.

1267
00:54:22,074 --> 00:54:23,474
We're here.

1268
00:54:23,907 --> 00:54:25,074
We're here.

1269
00:54:25,774 --> 00:54:28,807
If you miss this, you can't say you visited Pai.

1270
00:54:28,807 --> 00:54:31,707
(I agree but I can't answer because I'm out of breath)

1271
00:54:32,307 --> 00:54:38,340
(Pai Canyon is finally before their eyes)

1272
00:54:39,940 --> 00:54:41,240
(Pai Canyon)

1273
00:54:41,240 --> 00:54:44,107
(The famous attraction that captivates many travelers)

1274
00:54:44,107 --> 00:54:46,540
It looks quite high.

1275
00:54:48,807 --> 00:54:51,040
It looks very unique.

1276
00:54:51,040 --> 00:54:53,440
- It's very high. / - It looks interesting.

1277
00:54:53,440 --> 00:55:01,440
(You can witness the vastness of nature)

1278
00:55:04,174 --> 00:55:07,440
You have to take a photo in this spot.

1279
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:08,840
I checked out a lot of pictures.

1280
00:55:08,840 --> 00:55:10,640
But you have to be very careful here.

1281
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:12,107
- You have to be careful. / - What is this?

1282
00:55:12,107 --> 00:55:14,107
This is it.

1283
00:55:14,107 --> 00:55:15,507
It's a great spot.

1284
00:55:18,007 --> 00:55:19,107
I'm not moving.

1285
00:55:20,674 --> 00:55:21,740
What is that?

1286
00:55:21,740 --> 00:55:23,040
- That's scary. / - It was really scary.

1287
00:55:23,040 --> 00:55:24,540
Wow.

1288
00:55:25,740 --> 00:55:34,140
(You must take a photo on the edge of the cliff)

1289
00:55:34,140 --> 00:55:35,640
I don't think I can stand there.

1290
00:55:35,640 --> 00:55:37,674
There are people who are good at it though.

1291
00:55:37,674 --> 00:55:38,974
There are.

1292
00:55:40,207 --> 00:55:41,807
But the bottom was a little...

1293
00:55:41,807 --> 00:55:43,774
- It's so scary from here. / - Don't go.

1294
00:55:43,774 --> 00:55:45,707
The bottom is dug out.

1295
00:55:45,707 --> 00:55:48,107
So it's a little safe.

1296
00:55:48,107 --> 00:55:51,240
- It looks so scary. / - Just seeing it is scary.

1297
00:55:51,240 --> 00:55:52,507
It's so scary.

1298
00:55:54,740 --> 00:55:55,907
So this is what you do.

1299
00:55:56,640 --> 00:55:57,907
So this is what you do.

1300
00:55:59,107 --> 00:56:00,474
Wait, wait.

1301
00:56:01,974 --> 00:56:03,774
Why are they showing this now?

1302
00:56:04,207 --> 00:56:06,474
(His charisma is back on the cliff)

1303
00:56:06,474 --> 00:56:09,707
It makes you want to try and take that photo.

1304
00:56:09,707 --> 00:56:12,140
(Looking hot at Pai Canyon)

1305
00:56:12,774 --> 00:56:15,540
It's no joke. It's so pretty here.

1306
00:56:15,540 --> 00:56:17,640
There are no fences here

1307
00:56:17,640 --> 00:56:18,940
to keep it as natural as possible.

1308
00:56:18,940 --> 00:56:20,140
Be careful.

1309
00:56:20,140 --> 00:56:22,307
That looks scary.

1310
00:56:22,307 --> 00:56:24,074
He runs back.

1311
00:56:24,840 --> 00:56:26,940
- Be careful. / - So scary.

1312
00:56:26,940 --> 00:56:28,040
It's scary.

1313
00:56:29,274 --> 00:56:31,140
Yeah, be careful.

1314
00:56:31,140 --> 00:56:32,940
How does it feel there?

1315
00:56:32,940 --> 00:56:36,274
The right looks really scary and the left looks safe.

1316
00:56:36,274 --> 00:56:37,674
If you compare.

1317
00:56:37,674 --> 00:56:40,107
(Hongbin bravely took a picture on the cliff as well)

1318
00:56:40,107 --> 00:56:41,907
The photos look amazing.

1319
00:56:42,274 --> 00:56:46,674
(Another reason why the canyon is famous)

1320
00:56:47,374 --> 00:56:49,674
(The sunset you can watch from the cliff)

1321
00:56:49,674 --> 00:56:51,174
It's pretty.

1322
00:56:53,507 --> 00:56:55,740
You can't think of anything else when you watch a sunset.

1323
00:56:55,740 --> 00:56:56,240
Yeah.

1324
00:56:56,240 --> 00:56:57,240
Right?

1325
00:56:57,974 --> 00:57:00,674
The sun sets faster than I thought.

1326
00:57:01,440 --> 00:57:04,274
Still, we saw the end of sunset.

1327
00:57:04,274 --> 00:57:06,407
There's a reason why I wanted to see this.

1328
00:57:06,874 --> 00:57:08,407
We don't get many chances to see

1329
00:57:08,407 --> 00:57:09,407
sunrises and sunsets.

1330
00:57:09,407 --> 00:57:11,474
We're always busy getting ready in the morning.

1331
00:57:11,474 --> 00:57:13,174
On New Year's Day...

1332
00:57:13,174 --> 00:57:16,040
On New Year's Day, we were all on a stage together.

1333
00:57:16,040 --> 00:57:18,340
We have to attend award shows.

1334
00:57:18,340 --> 00:57:19,807
Here, today is New Year's Day.

1335
00:57:19,807 --> 00:57:21,607
It's like January 1st.

1336
00:57:21,607 --> 00:57:24,440
So you can start your diet in April.

1337
00:57:24,440 --> 00:57:26,640
Since the New Year starts in April.

1338
00:57:26,640 --> 00:57:30,040
Here, today is New Year's Day.

1339
00:57:30,040 --> 00:57:32,740
That's why I didn't want to miss this.

1340
00:57:32,740 --> 00:57:34,007
I love places like this.

1341
00:57:35,107 --> 00:57:36,674
I love it here.

1342
00:57:36,674 --> 00:57:40,474
I think those who work hard can rest better.

1343
00:57:40,474 --> 00:57:42,107
You can have a better rest.

1344
00:57:44,774 --> 00:57:46,307
(Lastly, they're going to have dinner)

1345
00:57:46,307 --> 00:57:48,140
- Finally, they're going to eat. / - What will they eat?

1346
00:57:48,140 --> 00:57:49,940
I've been waiting for this moment.

1347
00:57:49,940 --> 00:57:52,640
We worked really hard today, so let's go eat.

1348
00:57:52,640 --> 00:57:54,740
I'm sure there's lots to eat, right?

1349
00:57:54,740 --> 00:57:55,874
Here we are.

1350
00:57:56,474 --> 00:57:57,574
- Go, go, go. / - Restaurant.

1351
00:57:57,574 --> 00:57:58,840
- Thai food restaurant. / - Let's hurry.

1352
00:57:58,840 --> 00:57:59,740
I'm so hungry.

1353
00:58:02,274 --> 00:58:04,740
If you search for eateries in Pai,

1354
00:58:04,740 --> 00:58:06,707
this place always comes up.

1355
00:58:06,707 --> 00:58:08,474
You have to go there.

1356
00:58:08,474 --> 00:58:10,107
There are a lot of customers.

1357
00:58:10,107 --> 00:58:13,074
- There are many foreigners. / - Yes.

1358
00:58:13,807 --> 00:58:15,707
We had really delicious food there.

1359
00:58:15,707 --> 00:58:19,374
Apparently, this restaurant is a very famous restaurant.

1360
00:58:19,374 --> 00:58:20,240
I think I can eat a lot.

1361
00:58:20,240 --> 00:58:21,940
The restaurant is always full.

1362
00:58:21,940 --> 00:58:23,774
We have to try the fried fish.

1363
00:58:23,774 --> 00:58:25,874
- Looks delicious! / - And the braised ribs is famous.

1364
00:58:25,874 --> 00:58:28,407
- Braised ribs? / - Thai style braised ribs.

1365
00:58:28,407 --> 00:58:30,774
Thai style braised ribs and fried fish.

1366
00:58:30,774 --> 00:58:33,440
The best thing is cost of living is cheap in Thailand.

1367
00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:36,307
And Pai is one of the most affordable places.

1368
00:58:36,307 --> 00:58:38,540
And this restaurant is one of the cheapest in Pai.

1369
00:58:39,507 --> 00:58:42,207
So if you can get 2 to 3 dishes in Chiang Mai,

1370
00:58:42,207 --> 00:58:44,040
you can get 5 to 6 here.

1371
00:58:44,040 --> 00:58:45,274
Good quality and quantity.

1372
00:58:45,274 --> 00:58:47,374
Good quality, good quantity...

1373
00:58:47,374 --> 00:58:49,274
Sisters are happy, their husbands are happy,

1374
00:58:49,274 --> 00:58:50,774
you're happy and I'm happy.

1375
00:58:50,774 --> 00:58:51,807
You're an old man.

1376
00:58:52,507 --> 00:58:55,307
If he's an old man at 29, what am I?

1377
00:58:56,440 --> 00:58:59,674
- So this is the braised ribs? / - Yes.

1378
00:59:00,274 --> 00:59:01,607
This is the braised ribs.

1379
00:59:02,174 --> 00:59:03,807
(Chicken that tastes like braised ribs, $2)

1380
00:59:03,807 --> 00:59:06,474
It's a chicken dish but it tastes like braised ribs.

1381
00:59:07,140 --> 00:59:08,207
It's really cheap too.

1382
00:59:08,207 --> 00:59:11,240
- It's 60 baht, so $2.10. / - What?

1383
00:59:12,007 --> 00:59:13,674
That costs $2.10.

1384
00:59:13,674 --> 00:59:16,140
- That chicken dish costs $2.10? / - Yes.

1385
00:59:16,140 --> 00:59:17,774
- I remember the taste now. / - That's so good.

1386
00:59:20,207 --> 00:59:21,074
Shall we dig in?

1387
00:59:22,607 --> 00:59:24,207
- Let's eat because I'm starving. / - Okay.

1388
00:59:25,140 --> 00:59:27,807
First off, this is really famous here.

1389
00:59:28,407 --> 00:59:31,107
It's a little different to Korean braised ribs.

1390
00:59:31,107 --> 00:59:32,107
That's so good.

1391
00:59:32,107 --> 00:59:34,574
It's really good.

1392
00:59:34,574 --> 00:59:36,340
How is it? Good?

1393
00:59:36,340 --> 00:59:38,440
It's not exactly braised ribs.

1394
00:59:38,440 --> 00:59:39,740
It's like sweet and spicy chicken.

1395
00:59:39,740 --> 00:59:41,774
- Must be sweet and salty. / - It's not fried.

1396
00:59:41,774 --> 00:59:44,040
It's like really good boneless chicken.

1397
00:59:44,440 --> 00:59:46,574
- And... / - Is it like braised chicken?

1398
00:59:46,574 --> 00:59:50,174
- It has a chili sauce. / - Like Andong braised chicken.

1399
00:59:51,074 --> 00:59:52,907
It'd be perfect with rice.

1400
00:59:54,574 --> 00:59:57,374
That was really delicious. I still remember the taste.

1401
00:59:57,374 --> 00:59:59,540
- We finished this one. / - We finished it.

1402
00:59:59,540 --> 01:00:00,640
We need to order another one.

1403
01:00:00,640 --> 01:00:02,340
Yes, order another one.

1404
01:00:04,140 --> 01:00:06,240
- Someone took it. / - That's right.

1405
01:00:06,240 --> 01:00:07,674
Who took it? I'm hungry.

1406
01:00:07,674 --> 01:00:10,207
Why did they only give us two ribs?

1407
01:00:10,807 --> 01:00:13,074
Let's order another one when she comes back.

1408
01:00:13,974 --> 01:00:14,640
What's this?

1409
01:00:14,640 --> 01:00:15,707
Fish?

1410
01:00:16,540 --> 01:00:18,507
- It's big. / - It's huge.

1411
01:00:19,107 --> 01:00:21,474
And one more please.

1412
01:00:22,874 --> 01:00:25,974
Wow, the fish. How do we eat this?

1413
01:00:25,974 --> 01:00:29,874
We thought it'd be small like Korean dish.

1414
01:00:29,874 --> 01:00:31,974
But they served it on that huge plate.

1415
01:00:31,974 --> 01:00:33,840
- It's huge, right? / - Yes.

1416
01:00:33,840 --> 01:00:36,140
It's for 4 people and only costs $6.80.

1417
01:00:36,140 --> 01:00:37,240
- That's so good. / - So cheap.

1418
01:00:37,674 --> 01:00:39,907
- Do we just eat it like this? / - That's a good price.

1419
01:00:40,474 --> 01:00:43,307
(Bones are so easily separated)

1420
01:00:43,307 --> 01:00:45,407
- It's so easily separated. / - It's just like chicken.

1421
01:00:45,407 --> 01:00:46,807
It's really like chicken.

1422
01:00:46,807 --> 01:00:48,574
It was like fried chicken.

1423
01:00:49,774 --> 01:00:52,507
It's like fried chicken. Really.

1424
01:00:52,507 --> 01:00:53,707
Try it.

1425
01:00:55,240 --> 01:00:57,740
- Isn't it? / - Why didn't you tell me it's hot?

1426
01:00:57,740 --> 01:01:00,240
It's not that hot.

1427
01:01:00,240 --> 01:01:02,207
This is super hot.

1428
01:01:03,707 --> 01:01:05,940
The fried part is really crispy

1429
01:01:05,940 --> 01:01:07,174
but the meat is tender.

1430
01:01:07,174 --> 01:01:10,707
It's a little... The texture is really like chicken.

1431
01:01:10,707 --> 01:01:11,107
That looks good.

1432
01:01:11,107 --> 01:01:15,140
Fish isn't normally like this, is it?

1433
01:01:15,140 --> 01:01:17,707
- This one is muscular. / - Its flesh is so plump.

1434
01:01:17,707 --> 01:01:18,907
It doesn't taste fishy at all.

1435
01:01:18,907 --> 01:01:23,840
Isn't this something you've never had before.

1436
01:01:23,840 --> 01:01:26,907
Oh, that crunch.

1437
01:01:29,407 --> 01:01:30,774
(Looks delicious)

1438
01:01:31,140 --> 01:01:33,807
It's spicy and tastes like vinegar.

1439
01:01:33,807 --> 01:01:34,940
Yes, it tastes like vinegar

1440
01:01:34,940 --> 01:01:36,607
and it tastes like wasabi.

1441
01:01:37,140 --> 01:01:39,274
It has a strong scent so it must have

1442
01:01:39,274 --> 01:01:40,107
those ingredients.

1443
01:01:40,107 --> 01:01:41,707
There's pepper too.

1444
01:01:41,707 --> 01:01:43,274
It's here.

1445
01:01:43,274 --> 01:01:44,507
Our favorite.

1446
01:01:44,507 --> 01:01:46,174
This one is my favorite.

1447
01:01:46,174 --> 01:01:48,840
I can live here for a month if I have this.

1448
01:01:49,774 --> 01:01:51,607
Even if you order 2, it's only $4.20.

1449
01:01:51,607 --> 01:01:53,740
- It tastes good with rice. / - Fried rice.

1450
01:01:53,740 --> 01:01:56,907
We also ordered spring rolls and fried shrimp.

1451
01:01:56,907 --> 01:01:58,474
We ordered everything.

1452
01:01:58,474 --> 01:01:59,574
This is a big serving.

1453
01:01:59,574 --> 01:02:01,140
You should eat like that though.

1454
01:02:01,140 --> 01:02:03,440
They gave us lots of rice. The fish is big too.

1455
01:02:03,440 --> 01:02:06,740
We ordered a lot but that was only $19.50.

1456
01:02:06,740 --> 01:02:08,274
That's really cheap.

1457
01:02:08,274 --> 01:02:10,307
As you can see, the table is full.

1458
01:02:10,307 --> 01:02:12,140
I feel relieved now.

1459
01:02:13,974 --> 01:02:16,207
I really like it.

1460
01:02:16,207 --> 01:02:18,207
Because you can experience different countries

1461
01:02:18,207 --> 01:02:19,740
in one place.

1462
01:02:19,740 --> 01:02:21,840
When we were at the canyon,

1463
01:02:21,840 --> 01:02:24,540
it felt like we were in another country.

1464
01:02:24,540 --> 01:02:27,740
The hot spring kind of felt like Japan.

1465
01:02:27,740 --> 01:02:29,040
Also our hotel was like

1466
01:02:29,040 --> 01:02:30,874
we were in a jungle.

1467
01:02:30,874 --> 01:02:34,374
- I want to go there. / - I really want to go.

1468
01:02:34,374 --> 01:02:36,840
Many people visit here because

1469
01:02:36,840 --> 01:02:38,540
they can experience a variety of things here.

1470
01:02:39,840 --> 01:02:44,107
(The second day in Pai starts before the sun rises)

1471
01:02:44,107 --> 01:02:45,540
That was beautiful.

1472
01:02:46,340 --> 01:02:47,174
What's that?

1473
01:02:48,574 --> 01:02:51,074
- There were a lot of stars. / - A lot of stars.

1474
01:02:51,074 --> 01:02:52,907
That's pretty.

1475
01:02:55,474 --> 01:02:56,874
Argh. Goodness.

1476
01:02:57,140 --> 01:02:59,174
Moths are flocking to my head.

1477
01:02:59,807 --> 01:03:01,040
What if they go into your mouth?

1478
01:03:02,207 --> 01:03:03,974
It's really dark.

1479
01:03:03,974 --> 01:03:07,274
You need to wear that flashlight on your head.

1480
01:03:07,274 --> 01:03:08,540
What time is it now?

1481
01:03:08,540 --> 01:03:09,907
The sun isn't even up yet.

1482
01:03:09,907 --> 01:03:12,440
- It's really dark. / - Because...

1483
01:03:12,440 --> 01:03:14,474
We have to go see the sunrise.

1484
01:03:14,474 --> 01:03:15,674
That's right. We'll go see the sunrise.

1485
01:03:15,674 --> 01:03:17,207
It's really dark.

1486
01:03:17,207 --> 01:03:19,474
It's 4:46 a.m.

1487
01:03:19,474 --> 01:03:21,240
It's very early.

1488
01:03:22,707 --> 01:03:23,640
The sun is up.

1489
01:03:24,907 --> 01:03:26,107
The sun is up.

1490
01:03:27,174 --> 01:03:29,140
I can feel the sun even with my eyes closed.

1491
01:03:29,140 --> 01:03:31,107
We have to go now

1492
01:03:31,107 --> 01:03:33,940
so we can see the sunrise.

1493
01:03:34,874 --> 01:03:37,274
Today, we'll drive to a place called

1494
01:03:37,274 --> 01:03:38,940
Yun Lai Viewpoint.

1495
01:03:38,940 --> 01:03:41,574
Don't look at me, please.

1496
01:03:41,574 --> 01:03:43,940
- The light was bright. / - It was really strong.

1497
01:03:43,940 --> 01:03:45,474
My dad told me to always look into people's eyes

1498
01:03:45,474 --> 01:03:47,040
when talking to them.

1499
01:03:47,040 --> 01:03:49,074
- We have to go now. / - Okay.

1500
01:03:49,074 --> 01:03:51,074
- Let's hurry up. / - We want to take time to see it.

1501
01:03:51,074 --> 01:03:52,307
Okay, let's go.

1502
01:03:52,307 --> 01:03:55,407
Seriously, it's really bright.

1503
01:03:56,540 --> 01:03:58,940
Yun Lai Viewpoint.

1504
01:03:58,940 --> 01:04:00,307
Look at this.

1505
01:04:00,307 --> 01:04:01,840
- Viewpoint. / - Yes.

1506
01:04:01,840 --> 01:04:03,574
There are a lot of pictures taken from high up.

1507
01:04:03,574 --> 01:04:05,540
You can look down and see everything.

1508
01:04:05,540 --> 01:04:06,507
We should go here.

1509
01:04:07,240 --> 01:04:08,407
Yun Lai Viewpoint.

1510
01:04:10,174 --> 01:04:11,674
That was really pretty.

1511
01:04:12,507 --> 01:04:15,474
Yun Lai Viewpoint. "Yun" means "cloud"

1512
01:04:15,474 --> 01:04:17,540
and "Lai" means "to come."

1513
01:04:18,007 --> 01:04:20,774
So it means "the clouds are coming."

1514
01:04:21,207 --> 01:04:25,074
(People visit the viewpoint to see the sunrise)

1515
01:04:25,074 --> 01:04:26,040
(What does the sunrise look like here?)

1516
01:04:26,040 --> 01:04:28,940
You don't have to spend a lot of money in Pai.

1517
01:04:28,940 --> 01:04:29,674
Right.

1518
01:04:29,674 --> 01:04:31,874
That was free, right?

1519
01:04:31,874 --> 01:04:33,874
- No, you have to pay 20 baht. / - How much is that?

1520
01:04:33,874 --> 01:04:36,940
- 68 cents. / - 68 cents.

1521
01:04:36,940 --> 01:04:41,240
(28-minute-drive to the viewpoint from hotel)

1522
01:04:42,007 --> 01:04:45,540
(The moon hasn't even set yet)

1523
01:04:45,540 --> 01:04:49,040
We're hiking up to Yun Lai Viewpoint.

1524
01:04:49,040 --> 01:04:51,307
There are so many stars in the sky.

1525
01:04:53,140 --> 01:04:54,440
I haven't seen this many stars in so long.

1526
01:04:55,374 --> 01:04:56,940
It's so pretty.

1527
01:04:57,440 --> 01:04:59,674
I love this mood.

1528
01:05:01,207 --> 01:05:03,407
They all look like stars.

1529
01:05:03,407 --> 01:05:04,540
- It's so pretty. / - It really is.

1530
01:05:04,540 --> 01:05:06,840
It makes my heart flutter.

1531
01:05:07,507 --> 01:05:08,707
What is this place?

1532
01:05:09,540 --> 01:05:11,874
I think it's a cafe.

1533
01:05:11,874 --> 01:05:13,007
It's open really early in the morning.

1534
01:05:13,007 --> 01:05:15,140
It makes me want to take pictures.

1535
01:05:15,140 --> 01:05:17,840
- Let's get some tea. / - Let's buy tea and sit down.

1536
01:05:17,840 --> 01:05:19,607
Do we just wait here?

1537
01:05:21,574 --> 01:05:23,340
Like this?

1538
01:05:24,440 --> 01:05:26,340
Isn't it too dark?

1539
01:05:26,340 --> 01:05:29,074
People will think we really have nothing to do.

1540
01:05:29,074 --> 01:05:31,274
But this is relaxing.

1541
01:05:31,274 --> 01:05:32,407
Do you want a cup of tea?

1542
01:05:32,807 --> 01:05:33,974
I'll pour it for you.

1543
01:05:34,674 --> 01:05:36,407
You can pour mine.

1544
01:05:37,040 --> 01:05:38,407
It's not like this is alcohol.

1545
01:05:39,240 --> 01:05:41,607
We don't have to pour each other's tea.

1546
01:05:41,607 --> 01:05:44,774
This is being considerate. Don't you think so?

1547
01:05:44,774 --> 01:05:46,274
Should we clink?

1548
01:05:46,274 --> 01:05:48,440
Why? It's not like we're drinking.

1549
01:05:48,440 --> 01:05:50,207
You complain but you do it anyway.

1550
01:05:52,074 --> 01:05:54,340
See? You're a good fit.

1551
01:05:54,340 --> 01:05:56,040
You complain but you still do it.

1552
01:05:56,040 --> 01:05:57,707
He's like a little brother.

1553
01:05:57,707 --> 01:05:59,607
I can't drink it. It's really hot.

1554
01:05:59,607 --> 01:06:01,974
(Sipping)

1555
01:06:03,540 --> 01:06:05,107
I'll let it cool.

1556
01:06:05,107 --> 01:06:06,774
It's really sweet.

1557
01:06:08,474 --> 01:06:09,374
It's sweet.

1558
01:06:10,140 --> 01:06:12,140
Why did we get there so early?

1559
01:06:12,140 --> 01:06:15,174
We went early because we didn't want to miss it.

1560
01:06:15,174 --> 01:06:16,974
- There's an hour left, right? / - Yes.

1561
01:06:16,974 --> 01:06:18,207
We got there an hour early.

1562
01:06:18,207 --> 01:06:21,707
It's okay to get there an hour later.

1563
01:06:22,340 --> 01:06:23,740
Even when it gets bright...

1564
01:06:23,740 --> 01:06:26,740
- The grain comes out later. / - Right.

1565
01:06:26,740 --> 01:06:28,407
Grain?

1566
01:06:28,840 --> 01:06:29,840
The kernel.

1567
01:06:30,574 --> 01:06:32,707
Have you been to places to see the sunrise before?

1568
01:06:32,707 --> 01:06:33,740
Before?

1569
01:06:33,740 --> 01:06:36,874
People think of sunrise as a special event

1570
01:06:36,874 --> 01:06:39,040
when they go somewhere to see it.

1571
01:06:39,040 --> 01:06:40,374
That's usually the case.

1572
01:06:40,374 --> 01:06:43,940
When I was living in the Buddhist temple...

1573
01:06:45,607 --> 01:06:47,440
I saw it every day.

1574
01:06:48,507 --> 01:06:50,674
So the temple was a famous sunrise spot.

1575
01:06:50,674 --> 01:06:53,707
Yes, because it was on a mountain. This is what I saw.

1576
01:06:54,874 --> 01:06:56,740
It was always like this.

1577
01:06:56,740 --> 01:06:58,240
- You lived in a place like this. / - Yes.

1578
01:06:58,607 --> 01:07:01,540
(This is all too familiar to Hongbin)

1579
01:07:01,540 --> 01:07:02,907
Do you remember?

1580
01:07:02,907 --> 01:07:05,974
Living in a temple is my only childhood memory,

1581
01:07:05,974 --> 01:07:07,140
so I remember it.

1582
01:07:07,140 --> 01:07:08,474
I visit often too.

1583
01:07:08,940 --> 01:07:12,207
My dad took me to Gangwon-do

1584
01:07:12,207 --> 01:07:13,807
every year on January 1st.

1585
01:07:13,807 --> 01:07:16,174
I really didn't want to go. But I'm reminded of it.

1586
01:07:16,174 --> 01:07:19,507
I shouldn't have complained then.

1587
01:07:20,740 --> 01:07:23,007
This is so relaxing to watch the sunrise

1588
01:07:23,007 --> 01:07:24,840
while sipping on tea.

1589
01:07:24,840 --> 01:07:29,540
- It feels very free. / - It's peaceful.

1590
01:07:30,707 --> 01:07:32,340
I love things like this.

1591
01:07:32,340 --> 01:07:34,207
For me, it's so...

1592
01:07:34,207 --> 01:07:35,540
People are coming.

1593
01:07:35,540 --> 01:07:37,407
I guess we came too early.

1594
01:07:37,407 --> 01:07:39,974
They came after it got bright.

1595
01:07:39,974 --> 01:07:42,307
We didn't know the right timing.

1596
01:07:42,307 --> 01:07:44,374
I think it'll rise soon.

1597
01:07:45,040 --> 01:07:48,274
- Here... / - You've been saying that for 30 minutes.

1598
01:07:48,274 --> 01:07:49,974
I guess you'll be right at some point.

1599
01:07:50,940 --> 01:07:52,640
I've seen sunrises before.

1600
01:07:52,640 --> 01:07:53,540
This means it's rising.

1601
01:07:53,540 --> 01:07:54,707
This is so funny.

1602
01:07:54,707 --> 01:07:57,007
If the moon is up there, the sun isn't rising.

1603
01:07:57,007 --> 01:07:58,640
I think it's rising, isn't it?

1604
01:07:58,640 --> 01:08:00,107
Shouldn't it come up now?

1605
01:08:00,107 --> 01:08:02,640
Hasn't it risen yet?

1606
01:08:02,640 --> 01:08:04,374
It's really bright.

1607
01:08:04,374 --> 01:08:05,340
You've never seen a sunrise, have you?

1608
01:08:05,340 --> 01:08:07,707
The grain will come out later.

1609
01:08:07,707 --> 01:08:10,207
It might be already up behind the clouds.

1610
01:08:10,207 --> 01:08:11,174
Exactly.

1611
01:08:11,174 --> 01:08:12,874
You don't think it rose already, do you?

1612
01:08:12,874 --> 01:08:13,807
I don't think so.

1613
01:08:13,807 --> 01:08:16,240
The circle has to rise now.

1614
01:08:16,240 --> 01:08:17,774
I want to see the grain.

1615
01:08:17,774 --> 01:08:18,874
Will it rise?

1616
01:08:18,874 --> 01:08:20,607
We can't just sit here

1617
01:08:20,607 --> 01:08:23,274
and do nothing.

1618
01:08:23,274 --> 01:08:25,907
Since we have some tea here,

1619
01:08:25,907 --> 01:08:27,407
let's act like classical scholars

1620
01:08:27,407 --> 01:08:29,640
and have some creative time.

1621
01:08:29,640 --> 01:08:31,140
Creative time?

1622
01:08:31,140 --> 01:08:33,840
Lyricists, poets and writers usually

1623
01:08:33,840 --> 01:08:35,774
get inspiration from views

1624
01:08:35,774 --> 01:08:38,207
such as the one before us.

1625
01:08:38,207 --> 01:08:38,807
Mostly...

1626
01:08:38,807 --> 01:08:40,340
So we prepared this.

1627
01:08:40,340 --> 01:08:41,774
Creative time.

1628
01:08:43,174 --> 01:08:47,307
(Creative writing time at sunrise)

1629
01:08:47,307 --> 01:08:50,874
I'll show you a 2-verse poem to warm up.

1630
01:08:50,874 --> 01:08:53,074
I'll do a poem with VIXX.

1631
01:08:53,074 --> 01:08:54,807
- As a warm up? / - Yes.

1632
01:08:54,807 --> 01:08:56,307
Wait, I need inspiration.

1633
01:08:57,640 --> 01:08:58,507
Okay, I got it.

1634
01:08:58,507 --> 01:08:59,474
VI...

1635
01:08:59,474 --> 01:09:01,574
VIXX has released a new album.

1636
01:09:01,574 --> 01:09:02,207
XX.

1637
01:09:02,207 --> 01:09:03,540
Sugoi!

1638
01:09:03,874 --> 01:09:05,674
(Sigh)

1639
01:09:05,674 --> 01:09:08,874
Trying too hard.

1640
01:09:10,607 --> 01:09:11,974
Trying too hard.

1641
01:09:13,774 --> 01:09:15,740
This is really funny.

1642
01:09:15,740 --> 01:09:17,740
If there was an audience,

1643
01:09:17,740 --> 01:09:19,907
they would've laughed really hard.

1644
01:09:19,907 --> 01:09:21,240
Trying too hard.

1645
01:09:21,674 --> 01:09:23,807
- Do one with New Year. / - As a warm up?

1646
01:09:23,807 --> 01:09:25,207
Let's do New Year.

1647
01:09:27,407 --> 01:09:28,974
I start you off?

1648
01:09:28,974 --> 01:09:30,740
Are you getting into the mood?

1649
01:09:31,274 --> 01:09:33,274
- Are you getting into it? / - I was looking at the sun...

1650
01:09:33,274 --> 01:09:34,940
Are you letting the Japanese in you come out?

1651
01:09:34,940 --> 01:09:36,074
I'm doing it right now.

1652
01:09:37,607 --> 01:09:39,007
I've got it, I've got it.

1653
01:09:39,007 --> 01:09:41,007
Hurry up.

1654
01:09:41,007 --> 01:09:41,574
New.

1655
01:09:42,040 --> 01:09:44,507
The New Year sun is rising.

1656
01:09:44,507 --> 01:09:45,140
Year.

1657
01:09:45,140 --> 01:09:45,940
Huh?

1658
01:09:45,940 --> 01:09:46,840
It's really rising.

1659
01:09:47,374 --> 01:09:48,174
Huh?

1660
01:09:48,174 --> 01:09:49,107
It's really rising.

1661
01:09:50,474 --> 01:09:51,474
Huh?

1662
01:09:51,474 --> 01:09:52,740
It's really rising.

1663
01:09:53,774 --> 01:09:55,407
What? You're supposed to focus on my poem.

1664
01:09:55,407 --> 01:09:57,840
The sun needs to be focused on, not you.

1665
01:09:57,840 --> 01:09:59,174
Of course it's the sun.

1666
01:09:59,174 --> 01:10:00,574
That timing...

1667
01:10:00,574 --> 01:10:02,940
My poem was amazing.

1668
01:10:02,940 --> 01:10:04,540
It's so red.

1669
01:10:07,507 --> 01:10:09,507
It looks so foreign.

1670
01:10:10,740 --> 01:10:12,240
My poem was so good.

1671
01:10:12,240 --> 01:10:13,940
Why did it have to rise now?

1672
01:10:13,940 --> 01:10:15,040
It has to rise.

1673
01:10:15,874 --> 01:10:17,640
It didn't rise for one and a half hours

1674
01:10:17,640 --> 01:10:19,274
and had to rise when I said my poem.

1675
01:10:19,274 --> 01:10:22,407
- Was it pretty? / - More than pretty, it was fascinating.

1676
01:10:22,407 --> 01:10:24,640
- Fascinating? / - It's a really distinct circle.

1677
01:10:26,340 --> 01:10:28,174
- Wow. / - So pretty.

1678
01:10:28,174 --> 01:10:29,874
- That is fascinating. / - It's really different.

1679
01:10:29,874 --> 01:10:31,107
Rising between the clouds.

1680
01:10:31,107 --> 01:10:33,074
Isn't it so round?

1681
01:10:33,074 --> 01:10:34,807
It's like a painting.

1682
01:10:36,174 --> 01:10:38,507
It was worth getting up early for this.

1683
01:10:38,507 --> 01:10:40,907
We can see the sun clearly.

1684
01:10:41,440 --> 01:10:42,607
It's like a painting.

1685
01:10:43,274 --> 01:10:46,140
Let's make a wish here.

1686
01:10:46,140 --> 01:10:47,107
I'll go first.

1687
01:10:48,407 --> 01:10:50,207
I hope VIXX's new album will be successful.

1688
01:10:50,207 --> 01:10:53,207
And I hope the members and fans of VIXX

1689
01:10:53,207 --> 01:10:55,474
will be happy and healthy this year.

1690
01:10:56,074 --> 01:10:57,107
What should I say?

1691
01:10:57,774 --> 01:11:00,140
Wishes are supposed to be selfish.

1692
01:11:00,140 --> 01:11:01,574
Really? I'll do it again.

1693
01:11:01,574 --> 01:11:03,240
I hope only I'll be successful.

1694
01:11:06,540 --> 01:11:07,640
By the time this video airs,

1695
01:11:07,640 --> 01:11:09,574
we'll be promoting our new album.

1696
01:11:09,574 --> 01:11:11,207
Please let it be a great success.

1697
01:11:11,540 --> 01:11:12,674
Let's go, VIXX.

1698
01:11:14,807 --> 01:11:15,907
Look above. To the left.

1699
01:11:15,907 --> 01:11:18,074
Right here...

1700
01:11:18,074 --> 01:11:18,774
It's here.

1701
01:11:20,640 --> 01:11:21,807
Like this.

1702
01:11:23,407 --> 01:11:25,274
For the photo...

1703
01:11:25,274 --> 01:11:27,074
We wanted it inside the heart.

1704
01:11:27,074 --> 01:11:29,340
(The sun is in their hands)

1705
01:11:30,440 --> 01:11:35,307
(A perfect end to their trip in Pai)

1706
01:11:36,240 --> 01:11:37,974
How do you feel watching the sunrise?

1707
01:11:38,474 --> 01:11:39,140
It's not bad.

1708
01:11:39,140 --> 01:11:41,807
I know. We were a little tired at first

1709
01:11:41,807 --> 01:11:43,507
but you forget about that once you see it.

1710
01:11:43,507 --> 01:11:45,974
It was better than I expected.

1711
01:11:45,974 --> 01:11:48,874
We enjoyed some inner healing...

1712
01:11:48,874 --> 01:11:50,507
- And relaxation in Pai. / - That's right.

1713
01:11:50,507 --> 01:11:53,574
So in Chiang Mai, we'll enjoy activities.

1714
01:11:53,574 --> 01:11:55,940
I think I can say good-bye to Pai like this.

1715
01:11:57,107 --> 01:11:59,307
Bye, Pai.

1716
01:12:04,740 --> 01:12:06,474
Hakyeon, Hongbin, Tuhi Trip.

1717
01:12:06,474 --> 01:12:12,474
(Tuhi Trip will see you in Chiang Mai)

1718
01:12:13,674 --> 01:12:14,374
(Songkran Festival finally begins)

1719
01:12:14,374 --> 01:12:16,340
- It's begun. / - Now we're in Songkran.

1720
01:12:16,840 --> 01:12:20,407
(One of the world's top 10 water festivals)

1721
01:12:20,874 --> 01:12:24,607
(The most intense New Year's in the world)

1722
01:12:24,607 --> 01:12:26,374
Hongbin, let's get it started.

1723
01:12:28,340 --> 01:12:29,674
I can't lose!

1724
01:12:30,007 --> 01:12:33,907
(We'll give as good as we got)

1725
01:12:34,974 --> 01:12:39,707
(Tuhi Trip is at the center of Songkran Festival)

1726
01:12:41,140 --> 01:12:43,040
Can you stop for a minute?

1727
01:12:44,007 --> 01:12:46,207
(Songkran Festival continues next week)

1728
01:12:48,440 --> 01:12:51,140
- We enjoyed your trip. / - That was so good.

1729
01:12:51,707 --> 01:12:53,474
So you rented the scooter.

1730
01:12:53,474 --> 01:12:55,574
Did you pay a tip?

1731
01:12:55,574 --> 01:12:58,740
The price varies depending on the engine.

1732
01:12:58,740 --> 01:13:01,207
It was the price of the scooter we rented.

1733
01:13:01,207 --> 01:13:02,640
- It was about $13. / - Yes, about $13.

1734
01:13:02,640 --> 01:13:03,807
- For 1 day? / - Yes.

1735
01:13:03,807 --> 01:13:05,340
If you have an international driver's license,

1736
01:13:05,340 --> 01:13:08,340
you'll be fine even if you're not that good at driving.

1737
01:13:08,340 --> 01:13:10,907
What if I don't have a driver's license

1738
01:13:10,907 --> 01:13:13,507
and can't ride a bike?

1739
01:13:13,507 --> 01:13:15,707
There's no bus in the city.

1740
01:13:15,707 --> 01:13:16,940
How would I move around?

1741
01:13:16,940 --> 01:13:19,207
You can use the local travel agency car.

1742
01:13:19,207 --> 01:13:20,274
- I should book it in advance? / - Yes.

1743
01:13:20,274 --> 01:13:22,240
You can book it in Korea.

1744
01:13:22,240 --> 01:13:24,374
It won't be a problem.

1745
01:13:24,374 --> 01:13:26,574
You don't have to worry about transportation.

1746
01:13:26,574 --> 01:13:27,874
I see.

1747
01:13:27,874 --> 01:13:31,307
Now N and Hongbin will give us their last words.

1748
01:13:31,307 --> 01:13:34,440
Pai is not well-known even among travel enthusiasts.

1749
01:13:34,440 --> 01:13:37,107
So even those who have been to Thailand a lot,

1750
01:13:37,107 --> 01:13:40,140
I'd recommend that they check out Pai.

1751
01:13:40,140 --> 01:13:42,840
You should visit on your way to Thailand.

1752
01:13:42,840 --> 01:13:43,940
Are you ready?

1753
01:13:43,940 --> 01:13:47,140
The Tuhi Trip Tour.

1754
01:13:47,140 --> 01:13:49,174
Will you go to Pai, Thailand? Yes or no?

1755
01:13:49,174 --> 01:13:51,274
Please vote!

1756
01:13:51,940 --> 01:13:56,974
(What will the judges choose?)

1757
01:14:01,274 --> 01:14:04,774
Will it be Myanmar, with their new unknown world?

1758
01:14:04,774 --> 01:14:06,607
Will it be the Firefighter Tour?

1759
01:14:06,607 --> 01:14:10,174
Will it be the Shangri-La of Thailand?

1760
01:14:10,174 --> 01:14:12,674
Will it be the Tuhi Trip?

1761
01:14:12,674 --> 01:14:15,707
What did the judges choose?

1762
01:14:16,507 --> 01:14:18,074
Here we go, here we go.

1763
01:14:18,074 --> 01:14:22,407
- Firefighting Tour... / - This week's result...

1764
01:14:22,407 --> 01:14:24,074
- Oh? / - Is it a one-vote difference?

1765
01:14:24,074 --> 01:14:25,074
Is it a one-vote difference?

1766
01:14:25,774 --> 01:14:27,374
- One-vote? / - We won.

1767
01:14:30,540 --> 01:14:31,874
We won.

1768
01:14:31,874 --> 01:14:34,907

(Next episode)

1787
01:15:13,107 --> 01:15:14,740
Even if you can't speak the language,

1788
01:15:14,740 --> 01:15:16,540
just spraying water is communicating.

1789
01:15:17,474 --> 01:15:18,140

No one will touch me.

1798
01:15:34,474 --> 01:15:35,707
I can't lose.

Happy New Year.

1800
01:15:37,874 --> 01:15:39,574
