00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,574
Hello, I live in Jinju.

2
00:00:02,574 --> 00:00:04,908
I'm Gwon Minseong, 33 years old.

3
00:00:04,908 --> 00:00:08,008
I'm planning a hot spring trip for the winter.

4
00:00:08,008 --> 00:00:10,374
Please plan a unique hot spring trip

5
00:00:10,374 --> 00:00:13,874
that will refresh my mind and body on Battle Trip.

6
00:00:15,341 --> 00:00:18,074
(Nha Trang, Vietnam, hot spring trip)

7
00:00:19,341 --> 00:00:20,308
This is nice.

8
00:00:20,308 --> 00:00:21,574
Can't I leave it here?

9
00:00:21,574 --> 00:00:23,174
Vietnam.

10
00:00:23,174 --> 00:00:25,774
There's a legend that's similar to one in Korea.

11
00:00:25,774 --> 00:00:27,741
I'm so scared.

12
00:00:27,741 --> 00:00:28,574
It's all good but

13
00:00:28,574 --> 00:00:30,408
they don't give us napkins.

14
00:00:30,408 --> 00:00:31,441
Darn it!

15
00:00:31,441 --> 00:00:32,774
Milk!

16
00:00:32,774 --> 00:00:33,774
You insane?

17
00:00:36,008 --> 00:00:38,508
It's a mud hot spring with an egg theme.

18
00:00:38,508 --> 00:00:40,741
It's good because I like things like this.

19
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:42,841
Since prices are so low...

20
00:00:42,841 --> 00:00:45,241
You can order whatever you like.

21
00:00:45,241 --> 00:00:46,308
It's really good.

22
00:00:46,308 --> 00:00:47,508
- It's so good. / - Yeah.

23
00:00:49,141 --> 00:00:51,208
- Nha Trang Tour. / - Nha Trang Tour.

24
00:00:51,208 --> 00:00:52,341
- Let's go. / - Let's go.

25
00:00:55,741 --> 00:00:58,374
(Numerous great tips on trips)

26
00:00:58,374 --> 00:01:00,208
It's time for Battle Trip where we give you

27
00:01:00,208 --> 00:01:01,641
great tips on trips.

28
00:01:01,641 --> 00:01:03,408
We're continuing on with the hot spring trips.

29
00:01:03,408 --> 00:01:05,708
Today, we're heading to Fukuoka.

30
00:01:05,708 --> 00:01:07,474
We're back with our four guests.

31
00:01:07,474 --> 00:01:08,208
Long time no see.

32
00:01:08,208 --> 00:01:09,941
- It's been a week. / - Oh, welcome.

33
00:01:09,941 --> 00:01:11,441
Nha Trang...

34
00:01:11,441 --> 00:01:13,241
- It was so... / - It was so good.

35
00:01:13,241 --> 00:01:14,508
So good.

36
00:01:14,508 --> 00:01:17,608
We accept that their food and prices were good.

37
00:01:17,608 --> 00:01:18,974
Please add that...

38
00:01:18,974 --> 00:01:21,308
Add dark circles under her eyes with CG.

39
00:01:21,308 --> 00:01:22,708
Add dark circles under her eyes with CG.

40
00:01:22,708 --> 00:01:24,741
- Why, ma'am? / - Us?

41
00:01:24,741 --> 00:01:26,274
- Yes. / - What do you mean?

42
00:01:26,274 --> 00:01:28,874
- We're so healthy. / - We're fine.

43
00:01:28,874 --> 00:01:31,174
- You're okay, right, Jungah? / - Yes.

44
00:01:31,174 --> 00:01:34,341
- For us... / - You looked tired from the first day.

45
00:01:34,341 --> 00:01:35,441
But...

46
00:01:35,441 --> 00:01:36,508
When it comes to traveling...

47
00:01:36,508 --> 00:01:38,841
Being cheap and having good food is important.

48
00:01:38,841 --> 00:01:41,241
- But who you're going with is also important. / - It is.

49
00:01:41,241 --> 00:01:43,841
And how well you spend your time there as well.

50
00:01:43,841 --> 00:01:45,041
- That's right. / - That's important.

51
00:01:45,041 --> 00:01:46,641
One of the beauties of traveling is

52
00:01:46,641 --> 00:01:47,908
the short distance trips.

53
00:01:47,908 --> 00:01:49,041
- Short distance. / - That's right.

54
00:01:49,041 --> 00:01:51,608
If you have to travel too far...

55
00:01:51,608 --> 00:01:53,741
- But Fukuoka is too close. / - Traveling far by car...

56
00:01:53,741 --> 00:01:55,541
- It's like Jeju-do. / - It wasn't that short.

57
00:01:55,541 --> 00:01:56,808
- It's true. / - It's too close.

58
00:01:56,808 --> 00:01:58,941
- It wasn't that short. / - It's a good thing.

59
00:01:58,941 --> 00:02:00,808
It's like an overseas trip in Jeju-do.

60
00:02:00,808 --> 00:02:03,808
No... You should go far for a trip.

61
00:02:03,808 --> 00:02:05,041
- A bit. / - That's not true.

62
00:02:05,041 --> 00:02:07,008
Fukuoka is a better place to go with children.

63
00:02:07,008 --> 00:02:09,374
It was a short trip but we used our time wisely.

64
00:02:09,374 --> 00:02:10,541
- It was nice. / - Let's watch it then.

65
00:02:10,541 --> 00:02:11,808
- It was nice. / - Let's watch it then.

66
00:02:11,808 --> 00:02:12,641
- Okay. / - Shall we?

67
00:02:12,641 --> 00:02:14,874
Is there anything special about Fukuoka?

68
00:02:14,874 --> 00:02:17,241
There have been many trips to Japan so far.

69
00:02:17,241 --> 00:02:19,708
You can forget about all those other trips to Japan.

70
00:02:19,708 --> 00:02:21,074
- Was it that good? / - It was that fun.

71
00:02:21,074 --> 00:02:23,508
There are more than 20 hot springs.

72
00:02:23,508 --> 00:02:24,408
In the village?

73
00:02:24,408 --> 00:02:25,708
Yes, in the village.

74
00:02:25,708 --> 00:02:27,241
- It's a hot spring village. / - Right.

75
00:02:27,241 --> 00:02:29,041
It's like a hot spring village.

76
00:02:29,041 --> 00:02:32,274
You get a medal at the entrance.

77
00:02:32,274 --> 00:02:36,508
- With it, you can go to any hot spring. / - Any?

78
00:02:36,508 --> 00:02:38,608
If you don't have time to go to each one,

79
00:02:38,608 --> 00:02:40,041
you can hand over the medal to someone else.

80
00:02:40,041 --> 00:02:40,874
You can pass it on?

81
00:02:40,874 --> 00:02:42,908
- That's right. / - It's a unique system.

82
00:02:42,908 --> 00:02:44,541
- It's like clubbing culture. / - That's right.

83
00:02:44,541 --> 00:02:46,008
- Like on club day. / - That's right.

84
00:02:46,008 --> 00:02:46,974
Is there a time limit?

85
00:02:46,974 --> 00:02:49,074
- You can use it for 6 months. / - 6 months?

86
00:02:49,074 --> 00:02:49,908
- Yes. / - If I can't use it...

87
00:02:49,908 --> 00:02:51,341
You can take it home and use it again?

88
00:02:51,341 --> 00:02:52,474
Yes. If I can't use it...

89
00:02:52,474 --> 00:02:54,608
- I can give it to someone else. / - Sounds expensive.

90
00:02:54,608 --> 00:02:56,341
Each place has a distinct feature.

91
00:02:56,341 --> 00:02:58,941
So you can choose the hot spring you want,

92
00:02:58,941 --> 00:03:00,141
experience it...

93
00:03:00,141 --> 00:03:02,774
- Then you can experience another one. / - Right.

94
00:03:02,774 --> 00:03:04,974
- It's really diverse. / - It's like Hot Spring Day.

95
00:03:04,974 --> 00:03:06,208
- That's right. / - Exactly.

96
00:03:06,208 --> 00:03:07,974
- Tell us about one dish. / - You can't leave food out.

97
00:03:07,974 --> 00:03:09,408
- In Fukuoka... / - When it comes to Fukuoka...

98
00:03:09,408 --> 00:03:11,341
- Pollack roe is famous there. / - Pollack roe?

99
00:03:11,341 --> 00:03:13,241
Pollack roe tastes the same everywhere.

100
00:03:13,241 --> 00:03:15,274
Pollack roe tastes the same everywhere.

101
00:03:15,274 --> 00:03:16,341
- That's right. / - It's nothing special.

102
00:03:16,341 --> 00:03:18,641
We brought some back because it was so good.

103
00:03:18,641 --> 00:03:19,108
Yeah.

104
00:03:19,108 --> 00:03:20,374
- I'm sorry, but... / - Unlike the Korean type...

105
00:03:20,374 --> 00:03:22,574
Can you turn off Jungsoo's mic?

106
00:03:22,574 --> 00:03:23,808
She keeps butting in.

107
00:03:23,808 --> 00:03:26,008
"Pollack roe tastes the same everywhere."

108
00:03:26,008 --> 00:03:27,874
How are we to make a living?

109
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:30,108
- The saltiness... / - Let us be on her dramas then!

110
00:03:31,508 --> 00:03:32,474
When it comes to Fukuoka...

111
00:03:32,474 --> 00:03:34,974
- The seafood is great there. / - Right.

112
00:03:34,974 --> 00:03:36,241
I heard there are a lot of beautiful women in Fukuoka.

113
00:03:36,241 --> 00:03:37,474
- Fukuoka beauties. / - Really?

114
00:03:37,474 --> 00:03:38,608
- The water's good. / - The women...

115
00:03:38,608 --> 00:03:40,608
- The food is fresh. / - Because the water is good.

116
00:03:40,608 --> 00:03:42,141
- I know. / - That's why their hot springs...

117
00:03:42,141 --> 00:03:43,241
and food are famous.

118
00:03:43,241 --> 00:03:45,541
Is the pollack roe eaten as a side dish?

119
00:03:45,541 --> 00:03:47,774
They eat it topped on rice.

120
00:03:47,774 --> 00:03:49,741
Unlike Korean pollack roe,

121
00:03:49,741 --> 00:03:53,674
they ferment it in kelp broth.

122
00:03:53,674 --> 00:03:54,841
It has a deep flavor.

123
00:03:54,841 --> 00:03:56,541
- It's tasty, but not salty. / - It's subtle.

124
00:03:56,541 --> 00:03:58,474
Pollack roe is popular in Fukuoka.

125
00:03:58,474 --> 00:03:59,774
When people go to Fukuoka...

126
00:03:59,774 --> 00:04:02,474
- They always buy them as gifts. / - That's right.

127
00:04:02,474 --> 00:04:04,008
- Did you buy it? / - Of course we did.

128
00:04:04,008 --> 00:04:04,774
Pollack roe mayonnaise...

129
00:04:04,774 --> 00:04:06,341
- I couldn't miss it. / - I bought pollack roe tubes.

130
00:04:06,341 --> 00:04:07,441
What about pollack roe mayonnaise?

131
00:04:07,441 --> 00:04:08,808
- I bought it as well. / - We bought that too.

132
00:04:08,808 --> 00:04:10,574
- I love pollack roe mayonnaise. / - It must be good.

133
00:04:10,574 --> 00:04:13,174
- It must be delicious. / - With the roe I bought...

134
00:04:13,174 --> 00:04:15,408
- I cooked pollack roe pasta... / - Coffee's better.

135
00:04:15,408 --> 00:04:17,908
- And many other dishes. / - Jungsoo keeps saying...

136
00:04:17,908 --> 00:04:20,008
"Coffee is better. Pollack roe isn't that good."

137
00:04:21,041 --> 00:04:21,808
Ma'am...

138
00:04:21,808 --> 00:04:23,641
We have plenty of good coffee in Korea.

139
00:04:23,641 --> 00:04:26,241
I'd better never see you eating pollack roe!

140
00:04:27,274 --> 00:04:29,041
Just you wait.

141
00:04:29,041 --> 00:04:30,074
Lee Hwijae...

142
00:04:30,074 --> 00:04:31,708
Lee Hwijae, you insane?

143
00:04:31,708 --> 00:04:32,974
You insane?

144
00:04:32,974 --> 00:04:33,841
Fine, I am!

145
00:04:35,474 --> 00:04:36,508
Okay, everyone.

146
00:04:36,508 --> 00:04:38,774
Let's check out the first half

147
00:04:38,774 --> 00:04:40,208
of the Fukuoka trip.

148
00:04:43,541 --> 00:04:46,174
(How far did you go in Fukuoka?)

149
00:04:46,174 --> 00:04:47,374
It's beautiful.

150
00:04:47,374 --> 00:04:48,174
It looks pretty.

151
00:04:49,274 --> 00:04:50,374
The flying time is about one hour.

152
00:04:50,374 --> 00:04:51,574
So nice.

153
00:04:56,074 --> 00:04:58,341
(There's plenty of cheap and good food)

154
00:04:58,808 --> 00:05:00,208
It's a foodie's paradise.

155
00:05:00,208 --> 00:05:01,341
That's the one.

156
00:05:01,341 --> 00:05:02,408
(Hot springs)

157
00:05:02,408 --> 00:05:03,941
(Healing)

158
00:05:03,941 --> 00:05:05,974
(Food tour)

159
00:05:05,974 --> 00:05:07,574
(Shopping)

160
00:05:07,574 --> 00:05:12,541
(Let's go to Fukuoka)

161
00:05:13,508 --> 00:05:14,808
Did you eat?

162
00:05:14,808 --> 00:05:16,808
I just ate whatever at home.

163
00:05:16,808 --> 00:05:18,041
Right? You had some brunch?

164
00:05:18,041 --> 00:05:19,341
- Just whatever. / - Right.

165
00:05:19,341 --> 00:05:21,774
What does this place remind you of?

166
00:05:21,774 --> 00:05:22,608
A hot spring.

167
00:05:22,608 --> 00:05:24,374
- It does, right? / - Isn't it a hot spring?

168
00:05:24,374 --> 00:05:26,641
- That's why I prepared this. / - You're right.

169
00:05:26,641 --> 00:05:27,441
Right.

170
00:05:27,441 --> 00:05:28,241
Isn't it a bathhouse?

171
00:05:28,241 --> 00:05:29,708
That was the concept...

172
00:05:29,708 --> 00:05:31,274
- Of that cafe. / - Since the theme is hot spring...

173
00:05:31,274 --> 00:05:33,308
We went to a cafe with a hot spring theme.

174
00:05:33,308 --> 00:05:34,708
Is it a cafe?

175
00:05:34,708 --> 00:05:35,941
It feels like...

176
00:05:35,941 --> 00:05:38,208
- We're at a hot spring. / - I know.

177
00:05:38,208 --> 00:05:40,908
This is like a warm up. Then we'll head to the

178
00:05:40,908 --> 00:05:42,974
hot spring and enjoy a hot bath there.

179
00:05:42,974 --> 00:05:45,774
Haven't we been to Japan twice?

180
00:05:45,774 --> 00:05:46,874
- Only once? / - No.

181
00:05:46,874 --> 00:05:49,474
- I went for a drama. / - Oh, once for a drama...

182
00:05:49,474 --> 00:05:52,141
- And it's been about 10 years. / - Right.

183
00:05:52,141 --> 00:05:53,741
The thing is...

184
00:05:53,741 --> 00:05:56,074
I heard Jungah

185
00:05:56,074 --> 00:05:57,674
recommended me.

186
00:05:57,674 --> 00:05:59,741
So I...

187
00:05:59,741 --> 00:06:01,874
I was so happy to hear.

188
00:06:01,874 --> 00:06:03,741
A trip can change depending

189
00:06:03,741 --> 00:06:05,208
on who you go with.

190
00:06:05,208 --> 00:06:07,174
- That's so true. / - I'll make it fun.

191
00:06:07,174 --> 00:06:08,241
So

192
00:06:08,241 --> 00:06:10,308
- I wanted to go with a close friend. / - I know.

193
00:06:10,308 --> 00:06:12,574
Even if we meet after a long time,

194
00:06:12,574 --> 00:06:14,608
we can go out for a cup of coffee.

195
00:06:14,608 --> 00:06:17,241
- And it feels like we met yesterday. / - Right.

196
00:06:17,241 --> 00:06:18,708
- Even if we don't meet so often. / - That's important.

197
00:06:18,708 --> 00:06:20,108
So I gave her a call.

198
00:06:20,108 --> 00:06:20,941
And Haeyeong was like,

199
00:06:20,941 --> 00:06:22,141
"Okay, Jungah!"

200
00:06:22,141 --> 00:06:23,008
That's how...

201
00:06:23,008 --> 00:06:25,074
- We ended up here. / - Make sure you take me.

202
00:06:25,074 --> 00:06:26,374
Do you often go to

203
00:06:26,374 --> 00:06:27,941
public bathhouses?

204
00:06:27,941 --> 00:06:29,474
We live near each other.

205
00:06:29,474 --> 00:06:31,508
- We live in the same neighborhood. / - Neighbors.

206
00:06:31,508 --> 00:06:32,241
Right.

207
00:06:32,241 --> 00:06:34,774
The thing is...

208
00:06:34,774 --> 00:06:38,574
It's kind of like a freestyle trip.

209
00:06:38,574 --> 00:06:40,841
- Have you been to Fukuoka? / - Never.

210
00:06:40,841 --> 00:06:42,008
Have you been there?

211
00:06:42,008 --> 00:06:44,141
Yes. I stayed in a ryokan.

212
00:06:44,141 --> 00:06:46,241
Hot springs are famous there.

213
00:06:46,241 --> 00:06:47,474
For me...

214
00:06:47,474 --> 00:06:48,541
- It's so beautiful. / - In Fukuoka...

215
00:06:48,541 --> 00:06:50,108
- Yufuin is beautiful. / - Yufuin.

216
00:06:50,108 --> 00:06:51,774
- Beppu. / - Yufuin is really nice.

217
00:06:51,774 --> 00:06:53,208
We're best friends going to Beppu.

218
00:06:53,208 --> 00:06:54,941
We're best friends going to Beppu.

219
00:06:54,941 --> 00:06:56,974
- She just made a pun. / - That's lame.

220
00:06:57,641 --> 00:07:00,241
You said you'd make it fun.

221
00:07:00,241 --> 00:07:01,641
We're best friends going to Beppu.

222
00:07:02,841 --> 00:07:04,541
You mean Beppu.

223
00:07:04,541 --> 00:07:05,808
Best friends.

224
00:07:06,674 --> 00:07:08,174
Yufuin.

225
00:07:09,541 --> 00:07:10,941
Yoo-hoo.

226
00:07:11,674 --> 00:07:12,908
Those places are famous but...

227
00:07:12,908 --> 00:07:13,974
Are we going there?

228
00:07:13,974 --> 00:07:15,741
- Not this time. / - We're not?

229
00:07:15,741 --> 00:07:18,874
This time, we're going

230
00:07:18,874 --> 00:07:20,408
to someplace new.

231
00:07:20,408 --> 00:07:23,308
- It's a secret. / - Not somewhere famous.

232
00:07:23,308 --> 00:07:24,941
That's right. You should go deep.

233
00:07:24,941 --> 00:07:25,974
Exactly.

234
00:07:25,974 --> 00:07:29,308
It's like a secret we can reveal

235
00:07:29,308 --> 00:07:31,841
on Battle Trip.

236
00:07:32,408 --> 00:07:34,608
- That's what I prepared. / - You know about it?

237
00:07:34,608 --> 00:07:36,274
- I prepared. / - You know about it?

238
00:07:36,274 --> 00:07:37,474
I don't know if she actually knows or...

239
00:07:37,474 --> 00:07:38,741
Right now...

240
00:07:38,741 --> 00:07:39,941
It's just...

241
00:07:41,374 --> 00:07:42,108
It's just...

242
00:07:42,108 --> 00:07:43,974
I bought this!

243
00:07:43,974 --> 00:07:44,841
Oh, my!

244
00:07:44,841 --> 00:07:46,274
- Check this out. / - Wow.

245
00:07:46,274 --> 00:07:47,974
It tells you where to go.

246
00:07:47,974 --> 00:07:50,141
- I can't believe this. / - She made a list.

247
00:07:50,141 --> 00:07:52,808
- Haeyeong prepared everything. / - So nice.

248
00:07:52,808 --> 00:07:55,374
- She did? / - I went to Japan several times.

249
00:07:55,374 --> 00:07:57,974
Fukuoka is famous for seafood.

250
00:07:57,974 --> 00:07:59,774
Do you like seafood? Would you like some...

251
00:07:59,774 --> 00:08:02,008
Would you like some seafood?

252
00:08:02,008 --> 00:08:03,974
I love seafood.

253
00:08:04,308 --> 00:08:05,941
Is there anything you want to eat?

254
00:08:05,941 --> 00:08:06,608
So much.

255
00:08:06,608 --> 00:08:07,774
- I love seafood. / - So much to eat.

256
00:08:07,774 --> 00:08:09,608
I like meat.

257
00:08:09,608 --> 00:08:12,074
And I like alcohol.

258
00:08:12,074 --> 00:08:13,208
I like hot springs.

259
00:08:13,208 --> 00:08:16,041
- There's so much. / - Desserts are famous there too.

260
00:08:16,041 --> 00:08:18,808
You know, desserts are sweet.

261
00:08:18,808 --> 00:08:22,074
So we might come back with extra pounds.

262
00:08:22,074 --> 00:08:23,408
That's alright. I can afford to gain some weight...

263
00:08:23,408 --> 00:08:25,374
- If I can be satisfied 120%. / - Right.

264
00:08:25,374 --> 00:08:26,808
- Right. / - I can lose weight afterwards.

265
00:08:26,808 --> 00:08:29,008
I guess your metabolism is still fast enough.

266
00:08:31,208 --> 00:08:32,108
You go.

267
00:08:32,108 --> 00:08:33,974
Just go.

268
00:08:33,974 --> 00:08:35,141
- 20s? / - Yeah.

269
00:08:35,141 --> 00:08:36,774
You're in your 40s.

270
00:08:39,374 --> 00:08:40,874
The original.

271
00:08:40,874 --> 00:08:42,108
If you just have this...

272
00:08:42,108 --> 00:08:43,508
This is cheaper.

273
00:08:45,808 --> 00:08:48,808
(Bubbly guide with dad jokes, Yun Haeyeong)

274
00:08:48,808 --> 00:08:51,574
Why are you so slow-witted?

275
00:08:51,574 --> 00:08:52,908
Think before you speak.

276
00:08:52,908 --> 00:08:53,908
Intimidating ladies.

277
00:08:56,674 --> 00:08:58,608
It's my first time in Fukuoka!

278
00:08:58,608 --> 00:08:59,074
So...

279
00:08:59,074 --> 00:09:01,108
This is so pretty.

280
00:09:01,108 --> 00:09:05,108
(Heart of a girl but intimidating, Yang Jungah)

281
00:09:06,174 --> 00:09:07,774
Hi!

282
00:09:09,174 --> 00:09:10,741
Was that a private pool?

283
00:09:10,741 --> 00:09:13,141
- Yes. / - And you had an ocean view.

284
00:09:13,941 --> 00:09:15,174
They are having yakiniku too.

285
00:09:15,708 --> 00:09:16,574
Open air hot spring too.

286
00:09:16,574 --> 00:09:18,374
- Japanese yakiniku... / - Yakiniku is so good.

287
00:09:22,041 --> 00:09:24,108
Fuku, Fuku, Fukuoka!

288
00:09:24,108 --> 00:09:25,974
Let's go warm ourselves up.

289
00:09:25,974 --> 00:09:26,841
How many years has it been?

290
00:09:26,841 --> 00:09:27,674
I know.

291
00:09:27,674 --> 00:09:28,808
- Being on a trip. / - I know.

292
00:09:28,808 --> 00:09:30,841
I'm happy to be on a plane.

293
00:09:30,908 --> 00:09:34,508
(Even boarding the plane gets them excited)

294
00:09:34,508 --> 00:09:36,441
Fuku, Fuku, Fukuoka.

295
00:09:37,441 --> 00:09:38,774
- Fuku, Fuku. / - See you soon.

296
00:09:39,574 --> 00:09:41,341
- Fuku, Fuku? / - Fuku, Fuku.

297
00:09:41,341 --> 00:09:42,974
To Fukuoka, the warm city.

298
00:09:42,974 --> 00:09:45,274
Destinations with short flight times.

299
00:09:45,274 --> 00:09:46,408
- They're the best. / - You're right.

300
00:09:46,408 --> 00:09:48,508
With the hotel close to the airport.

301
00:09:48,508 --> 00:09:49,941
- That's right. / - I prefer those places.

302
00:09:52,841 --> 00:09:55,641
(Fukuoka's weather is fairly warm the whole year)

303
00:09:55,641 --> 00:09:57,608
Since it's in the south, it's warm.

304
00:09:57,608 --> 00:09:59,941
It's ranked as the 7th best city to reside in the world.

305
00:09:59,941 --> 00:10:01,741
- It's ranked 7th? / - It's a sister city to Busan.

306
00:10:02,108 --> 00:10:05,041
(The city has beautiful sea and beaches)

307
00:10:05,041 --> 00:10:08,874
(Fukuoka)

308
00:10:11,208 --> 00:10:13,274
- We are finally here. / - Is this it?

309
00:10:14,641 --> 00:10:16,174
Fuku, Fuku.

310
00:10:16,174 --> 00:10:17,508
- The weather is amazing. / - Fukuoka.

311
00:10:17,508 --> 00:10:19,308
The weather here is excellent.

312
00:10:20,508 --> 00:10:22,041
Hey, is it summer here?

313
00:10:22,041 --> 00:10:24,941
- It never goes below zero. / - That's right.

314
00:10:24,941 --> 00:10:26,508
- It feels like we're in Jeju-do, right? / - Yeah.

315
00:10:26,508 --> 00:10:28,574
Since Japan is an island,

316
00:10:28,574 --> 00:10:30,441
the air is bound to be fresh.

317
00:10:30,441 --> 00:10:32,308
It's my first time in Fukuoka.

318
00:10:32,308 --> 00:10:33,208
Are you happy?

319
00:10:34,141 --> 00:10:35,608
If you're happy, I'm happy too.

320
00:10:35,608 --> 00:10:37,441
We need to take one of those buses.

321
00:10:37,441 --> 00:10:39,308
- Do you know where we're supposed to go? / - Sure.

322
00:10:39,308 --> 00:10:40,274
This is called...

323
00:10:41,074 --> 00:10:42,941
SUNQ Pass.

324
00:10:42,941 --> 00:10:44,374
For three days...

325
00:10:44,374 --> 00:10:45,608
1, 2, 3.

326
00:10:46,241 --> 00:10:47,274
North Kyushu...

327
00:10:47,274 --> 00:10:48,608
You can use this in Kyushu

328
00:10:48,608 --> 00:10:50,008
for all your transport.

329
00:10:50,008 --> 00:10:51,608
If you buy one of the passes...

330
00:10:51,608 --> 00:10:53,974
You can use public transports without a limit

331
00:10:53,974 --> 00:10:55,608
throughout the trip.

332
00:10:55,608 --> 00:10:57,208
When did you prepare these passes?

333
00:10:57,208 --> 00:10:59,008
It's cheaper in Korea.

334
00:10:59,008 --> 00:11:00,674
If you buy it here, it's too expensive.

335
00:11:00,674 --> 00:11:01,674
Did you buy them in Korea?

336
00:11:01,674 --> 00:11:03,308
Yes, I looked for them online.

337
00:11:03,308 --> 00:11:05,541
You should have told me then.

338
00:11:05,541 --> 00:11:08,041
Fukuoka has the shortest distance from

339
00:11:08,041 --> 00:11:09,974
the airport to the city in Asia.

340
00:11:09,974 --> 00:11:11,308
- Is that so? / - Yes.

341
00:11:11,308 --> 00:11:12,374
That's really short.

342
00:11:12,374 --> 00:11:13,474
- Jungah. / - Yeah?

343
00:11:13,474 --> 00:11:15,641
- Since we worked hard, we must feed. / - Right on!

344
00:11:15,641 --> 00:11:16,541
Let's go. Go!

345
00:11:16,541 --> 00:11:17,641
They're going to "feed" themselves.

346
00:11:17,641 --> 00:11:19,241
We worked hard for this.

347
00:11:26,241 --> 00:11:27,608
Hey, it's in Korean?

348
00:11:27,608 --> 00:11:29,441
There are a lot of signs in Korean.

349
00:11:30,608 --> 00:11:32,108
It's really nice that Korean is written on the bus.

350
00:11:32,108 --> 00:11:33,541
- That way, you won't get lost. / - You're right.

351
00:11:33,541 --> 00:11:35,374
They announce it in Korean too.

352
00:11:35,374 --> 00:11:38,808
- Chinese, Korean, English, and Japanese. / - Really?

353
00:11:38,808 --> 00:11:41,008
- Let's get on. / - Where do I put this? Here?

354
00:11:41,008 --> 00:11:41,974
Maybe not.

355
00:11:43,074 --> 00:11:43,908
This is not it.

356
00:11:44,474 --> 00:11:47,808
(Get on the bus from the back entrance, take ticket)

357
00:11:47,808 --> 00:11:49,708
(When getting off, show ticket and pay or present pass)

358
00:11:49,708 --> 00:11:51,808
(This is where you pay the fee)

359
00:11:52,308 --> 00:11:53,441
Come on over.

360
00:11:55,441 --> 00:11:56,408
We're on a bus.

361
00:11:56,408 --> 00:11:58,674
Have you ridden a bus on a trip?

362
00:11:58,674 --> 00:12:01,308
- I haven't been on a bus in ages. / - I know, right?

363
00:12:01,308 --> 00:12:03,374
I don't have to take the bus in Korea.

364
00:12:04,641 --> 00:12:05,574
Good-bye...

365
00:12:06,208 --> 00:12:07,408
Airport.

366
00:12:09,241 --> 00:12:10,841
The weather is really great.

367
00:12:10,841 --> 00:12:12,208
It's so good.

368
00:12:12,708 --> 00:12:13,908
Oh, the sun.

369
00:12:20,141 --> 00:12:21,308
It's 10 to 15 minutes.

370
00:12:21,308 --> 00:12:23,508
You can get there in 20 minutes.

371
00:12:27,574 --> 00:12:29,041
- The visuals... / -  I remember that!

372
00:12:29,808 --> 00:12:31,341
I love pollack roe.

373
00:12:31,341 --> 00:12:33,308
It's so good.

374
00:12:33,308 --> 00:12:34,808
It's famous for pollack roe.

375
00:12:34,808 --> 00:12:35,774
I can't wait.

376
00:12:35,774 --> 00:12:38,908
- I read that it's really popular. / - I know.

377
00:12:38,908 --> 00:12:41,708
We're going to a famous restaurant in Fukuoka, right?

378
00:12:41,708 --> 00:12:43,574
Pollack roe topped rice.

379
00:12:43,574 --> 00:12:44,808
You can look forward to it.

380
00:12:44,808 --> 00:12:46,441
- It'd be worth it. / - Will we have to wait?

381
00:12:47,441 --> 00:12:49,341
I'm going to eat it even if I have to wait for it.

382
00:12:52,374 --> 00:12:53,941
What I really liked was that

383
00:12:53,941 --> 00:12:56,041
I was hungry as soon as I got off,

384
00:12:56,041 --> 00:12:59,041
but the famous restaurant was only 5 minutes away.

385
00:12:59,041 --> 00:13:00,474
- Only 5 minutes? / - Yes.

386
00:13:00,474 --> 00:13:01,574
Fukuoka is great because

387
00:13:01,574 --> 00:13:03,308
you can reach everywhere on foot.

388
00:13:03,308 --> 00:13:05,241
- That's awesome. / - You're right.

389
00:13:05,241 --> 00:13:07,274
That's the type of city I like best.

390
00:13:07,274 --> 00:13:09,641
It's only 3 or 4 minutes away from here.

391
00:13:09,641 --> 00:13:10,741
- Really? / - On foot.

392
00:13:10,741 --> 00:13:12,908
We won't have to walk a lot.

393
00:13:12,908 --> 00:13:15,874
It's quite tranquil here, isn't it?

394
00:13:15,874 --> 00:13:16,908
- It's not crowded. / - Yeah.

395
00:13:16,908 --> 00:13:17,808
Unlike Tokyo

396
00:13:17,808 --> 00:13:21,074
or Ginza Street.

397
00:13:21,074 --> 00:13:22,274
It's autumn here.

398
00:13:24,674 --> 00:13:26,274
We get to walk around the park.

399
00:13:26,274 --> 00:13:27,874
It's relaxing, isn't it?

400
00:13:27,874 --> 00:13:29,108
The weather here is...

401
00:13:29,108 --> 00:13:30,608
Where is the restaurant?

402
00:13:32,141 --> 00:13:33,174
I think this is the place.

403
00:13:33,808 --> 00:13:35,441
Jungah, I think this must be the restaurant.

404
00:13:35,441 --> 00:13:36,341
- Is this the one? / - Yes.

405
00:13:37,141 --> 00:13:39,441
This is the restaurant.

406
00:13:39,441 --> 00:13:40,408
Come here. Hurry.

407
00:13:41,608 --> 00:13:42,741
Hi.

408
00:13:43,908 --> 00:13:45,508
Welcome.

409
00:13:49,808 --> 00:13:51,008
My gosh, that's a long queue.

410
00:13:51,008 --> 00:13:52,641
- It's like... / - There are so many autographs.

411
00:13:52,641 --> 00:13:54,374
- It was a famous restaurant. / - Looks tasty.

412
00:13:54,374 --> 00:13:55,608
But you didn't have to wait?

413
00:13:55,608 --> 00:13:57,708
In Japan, I always had to wait in line so...

414
00:13:57,708 --> 00:13:58,608
You normally would

415
00:13:58,608 --> 00:14:00,341
but we arrived a little late.

416
00:14:00,341 --> 00:14:01,874
So we were lucky.

417
00:14:01,874 --> 00:14:03,074
It already looks tasty.

418
00:14:03,074 --> 00:14:04,408
The table says it all.

419
00:14:05,374 --> 00:14:06,208
Look at all the autographs.

420
00:14:07,441 --> 00:14:09,374
Jungah, you should leave yours here too.

421
00:14:10,074 --> 00:14:11,941
Why would I do that? I doubt they know who I am.

422
00:14:13,974 --> 00:14:16,874
- I'm hungry. Let's order now. / - Right. We should.

423
00:14:17,641 --> 00:14:19,408
Excuse me.

424
00:14:19,408 --> 00:14:20,474
Give us the menu, please.

425
00:14:21,341 --> 00:14:21,741
Nice.

426
00:14:21,741 --> 00:14:23,708
"Give us the menu, please."

427
00:14:23,708 --> 00:14:26,174
- She spoke like a local. / - Nice and short.

428
00:14:26,174 --> 00:14:27,374
Well done.

429
00:14:27,374 --> 00:14:28,808
What's good here?

430
00:14:28,808 --> 00:14:31,374
- I want... / - Everything is in Korean.

431
00:14:31,374 --> 00:14:32,341
- That's right. / - This is nice.

432
00:14:32,341 --> 00:14:33,608
- Was it all in Korean? / - Yes.

433
00:14:33,608 --> 00:14:35,074
Really?

434
00:14:35,074 --> 00:14:35,974
You're right.

435
00:14:35,974 --> 00:14:37,841
- I like it. / - A combo?

436
00:14:37,841 --> 00:14:40,708
The rice with pollack roe

437
00:14:40,708 --> 00:14:41,774
is the most famous one.

438
00:14:41,774 --> 00:14:42,608
I want this one.

439
00:14:42,608 --> 00:14:44,141
- We'll get one of that. / - I want this one.

440
00:14:44,141 --> 00:14:45,408
Since we are here...

441
00:14:45,408 --> 00:14:47,008
- We should eat noodles. / - You're right.

442
00:14:47,008 --> 00:14:48,708
- Tsukemen. / - This looks good.

443
00:14:50,708 --> 00:14:51,908
- We'll get those two? / - Excuse me.

444
00:14:53,274 --> 00:14:55,541
Please give us this and this.

445
00:14:58,141 --> 00:14:59,741
She's good at Japanese.

446
00:14:59,741 --> 00:15:01,774
Please give us this and this.

447
00:15:05,574 --> 00:15:07,374
Thank you.

448
00:15:07,374 --> 00:15:08,974
- They understand. / - Korean...

449
00:15:08,974 --> 00:15:10,941
It's all in Korean...

450
00:15:10,941 --> 00:15:12,474
- Right. / - Don't you speak Japanese?

451
00:15:12,474 --> 00:15:14,974
What are you talking about?

452
00:15:14,974 --> 00:15:17,041
I know things like,

453
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:18,508
I just know interjections.

454
00:15:18,508 --> 00:15:20,274
Amazing!

455
00:15:20,274 --> 00:15:21,874
Pretty!

456
00:15:23,441 --> 00:15:24,574
Really?

457
00:15:25,174 --> 00:15:26,641
We're unbelievable.

458
00:15:26,641 --> 00:15:27,674
Jungah, our food is coming.

459
00:15:28,908 --> 00:15:29,808
Here they are.

460
00:15:30,908 --> 00:15:31,974
It's finally here.

461
00:15:31,974 --> 00:15:33,208
How good would it be?

462
00:15:34,241 --> 00:15:35,208
Here, here.

463
00:15:36,908 --> 00:15:38,308
Be careful. It's very hot.

464
00:15:38,308 --> 00:15:39,108
Ah, yeah.

465
00:15:41,908 --> 00:15:43,208
I'm salivating.

466
00:15:43,208 --> 00:15:44,208
- Right? / - Yeah.

467
00:15:45,208 --> 00:15:46,441
Just the visuals makes me drool.

468
00:15:47,341 --> 00:15:49,474
It's kind of like...

469
00:15:49,474 --> 00:15:50,941
When we eat soba,

470
00:15:50,941 --> 00:15:53,608
it'd be nice to dip a little every bite.

471
00:15:53,608 --> 00:15:54,574
I want to try that.

472
00:15:54,574 --> 00:15:55,841
- We'd better go. / - Yes, we ought to visit.

473
00:15:58,808 --> 00:15:59,874
- Pollack roe. / - This is the famous dish.

474
00:16:02,741 --> 00:16:03,874
That looks really good.

475
00:16:03,874 --> 00:16:05,074
It was amazing.

476
00:16:05,074 --> 00:16:06,541
- I bet it was delicious. / - Mix it with sesame.

477
00:16:06,541 --> 00:16:07,541
Mix it?

478
00:16:08,974 --> 00:16:10,441
Jungah, it wasn't sesame.

479
00:16:10,441 --> 00:16:11,541
It was pollack roe.

480
00:16:11,541 --> 00:16:12,908
It was pollack roe?

481
00:16:12,908 --> 00:16:14,674
Yes. You told me to mix the sesame but...

482
00:16:15,741 --> 00:16:17,008
It was pollack roe.

483
00:16:17,974 --> 00:16:20,874
It's not like I know. Geez.

484
00:16:20,874 --> 00:16:22,741
We are funny, aren't we?

485
00:16:23,974 --> 00:16:25,341
This looks so good.

486
00:16:26,608 --> 00:16:27,374
Try it, Jungah.

487
00:16:28,041 --> 00:16:28,974
I'm so excited.

488
00:16:28,974 --> 00:16:30,941
My mouth is salivating.

489
00:16:33,874 --> 00:16:35,041
I even ate my hair.

490
00:16:35,041 --> 00:16:36,808
I can taste the flavor more now...

491
00:16:36,808 --> 00:16:39,841
- Than when I was eating it. / - You're right.

492
00:16:39,841 --> 00:16:40,474
Is it good?

493
00:16:41,474 --> 00:16:42,674
Is it delicious?

494
00:16:42,674 --> 00:16:43,841
Is it delicious?

495
00:16:46,874 --> 00:16:47,774
Why? Why? Why?

496
00:16:47,774 --> 00:16:49,341
- It was a little. / - Haeyeong...

497
00:16:49,341 --> 00:16:51,241
- Has a unique sense of humor. / - Why?

498
00:16:52,374 --> 00:16:53,408
Is it delicious?

499
00:16:54,008 --> 00:16:55,608
I must have been starving.

500
00:16:55,608 --> 00:16:56,308
Is it good?

501
00:16:56,308 --> 00:16:57,641
(Mouthful)

502
00:17:00,641 --> 00:17:01,341
Was it salty?

503
00:17:01,341 --> 00:17:03,641
It was slightly salty.

504
00:17:03,641 --> 00:17:06,041
- We thought... / - It could be too salty for Koreans.

505
00:17:06,041 --> 00:17:08,474
- Pollack roe is salty for us. / - We just go there so...

506
00:17:08,474 --> 00:17:09,874
Is it good?

507
00:17:09,874 --> 00:17:10,841
It's salty.

508
00:17:12,908 --> 00:17:13,908
It's salty

509
00:17:13,908 --> 00:17:14,774
but it's good.

510
00:17:14,774 --> 00:17:16,474
- We should've poured the water. / - It's salty!

511
00:17:17,374 --> 00:17:19,641
We didn't pour the broth there.

512
00:17:19,641 --> 00:17:21,374
- You were supposed add the broth? / - Yes.

513
00:17:22,408 --> 00:17:22,941
I don't believe this.

514
00:17:22,941 --> 00:17:24,841
- You have to add the broth. / - That's usually salty.

515
00:17:24,841 --> 00:17:27,408
This must be hot water.

516
00:17:27,408 --> 00:17:30,474
- I don't think this is broth. / - We don't know anything.

517
00:17:30,474 --> 00:17:33,141
Japanese food is either salty or sweet.

518
00:17:33,141 --> 00:17:34,941
- But it's still tasty. / - It is, right?

519
00:17:34,941 --> 00:17:36,641
The aftertaste is quite flavorful.

520
00:17:37,208 --> 00:17:39,008
We had it too strong.

521
00:17:39,008 --> 00:17:41,308
By the way, the noodles are exceptional.

522
00:17:41,308 --> 00:17:42,008
They are firm.

523
00:17:42,008 --> 00:17:43,874
- You were supposed to dip them? / - That's right.

524
00:17:43,874 --> 00:17:44,941
That must be so good.

525
00:17:49,941 --> 00:17:51,908
With the water,

526
00:17:51,908 --> 00:17:53,174
it's the flavor I like.

527
00:17:55,208 --> 00:17:57,508
It has an addictive depth to the flavor.

528
00:17:57,508 --> 00:17:59,741
- It had depth. / - Depth of flavor.

529
00:17:59,741 --> 00:18:00,541
It's good.

530
00:18:00,541 --> 00:18:01,608
Let's try this one now.

531
00:18:02,141 --> 00:18:03,608
- That's right. / - When you make onigiri...

532
00:18:03,608 --> 00:18:05,174
- You make it with roe. / - How do you eat that?

533
00:18:05,174 --> 00:18:06,608
- Is there rice on the bottom? / - Yes.

534
00:18:06,608 --> 00:18:07,741
I see the rice.

535
00:18:08,408 --> 00:18:10,308
- Japanese rice is tasty. / - It's similar to gyudon.

536
00:18:10,308 --> 00:18:11,874
Goodness, my mouth is watering.

537
00:18:18,874 --> 00:18:20,941
- It's good. / - Kimchi, please.

538
00:18:23,108 --> 00:18:24,108
This is so good.

539
00:18:24,108 --> 00:18:26,041
- I want to eat kimchi now. / - What?

540
00:18:28,008 --> 00:18:29,341
By the way,

541
00:18:29,341 --> 00:18:30,441
I should try this too.

542
00:18:30,441 --> 00:18:33,774
I can put the rice in the bowl...

543
00:18:33,774 --> 00:18:35,708
And make an easy meal at home.

544
00:18:35,708 --> 00:18:37,274
- You're right. / - It's that type of menu.

545
00:18:37,274 --> 00:18:39,341
We'd need rice and dried laver

546
00:18:39,341 --> 00:18:40,708
with pollack roe on top.

547
00:18:41,408 --> 00:18:42,808
We can add

548
00:18:42,808 --> 00:18:44,474
the spicy sauce.

549
00:18:44,474 --> 00:18:45,708
We can mix it with the sauce.

550
00:18:45,708 --> 00:18:47,141
You can make this at home.

551
00:18:47,141 --> 00:18:49,774
- But it wouldn't taste the same. / - You're right.

552
00:18:49,774 --> 00:18:51,608
- Not at home. / - It's not the same.

553
00:18:51,608 --> 00:18:53,108
The sauce is unique.

554
00:18:53,841 --> 00:18:56,174
There is seasoning like furikake on top.

555
00:18:56,774 --> 00:18:58,908
You're right. They don't taste like pollack roe.

556
00:18:58,908 --> 00:19:00,674
I can taste something else too.

557
00:19:00,674 --> 00:19:01,808
Wasn't it salty?

558
00:19:01,808 --> 00:19:03,741
It wasn't soy sauce.

559
00:19:03,741 --> 00:19:06,641
- It's a kelp... / - Tsuyu sauce.

560
00:19:06,641 --> 00:19:08,441
We ordered the original one but

561
00:19:08,441 --> 00:19:10,641
there are other special sauces, like spicy sauce.

562
00:19:10,641 --> 00:19:12,441
- You can pick and choose. / - You can choose?

563
00:19:13,908 --> 00:19:14,841
- Is it good? / - Yes.

564
00:19:18,208 --> 00:19:19,808
- Isn't it good, Haeyeong? / - Yes.

565
00:19:19,808 --> 00:19:21,174
My gosh, I'm full.

566
00:19:21,974 --> 00:19:23,074
I ate so well.

567
00:19:23,074 --> 00:19:24,241
I'm hungry.

568
00:19:25,341 --> 00:19:28,141
- Let's eat more while shopping. / - Sure, sure.

569
00:19:28,141 --> 00:19:29,574
Thank you for the food.

570
00:19:29,574 --> 00:19:30,874
How much is it?

571
00:19:33,474 --> 00:19:36,341
Fukuoka is famous for this ingredient.

572
00:19:36,341 --> 00:19:38,541
One of the things we must buy from Fukuoka is...

573
00:19:38,541 --> 00:19:41,208
Pollack roe.

574
00:19:41,208 --> 00:19:42,441
And the desserts.

575
00:19:42,441 --> 00:19:44,008
I heard that anyone who visits, must buy pollack roe.

576
00:19:44,008 --> 00:19:45,574
Every snack tastes delicious

577
00:19:45,574 --> 00:19:47,141
with pollack roe mayonnaise.

578
00:19:47,908 --> 00:19:49,408
The pollack roe will be enough to

579
00:19:49,408 --> 00:19:52,408
make the whole dish taste delicious.

580
00:19:52,408 --> 00:19:54,074
We need to buy something like that.

581
00:19:56,708 --> 00:19:58,774
This store is located in downtown, Fukuoka.

582
00:19:58,774 --> 00:19:59,941
- That must be a famous shop. / - Yes.

583
00:19:59,941 --> 00:20:01,674
It's extremely famous.

584
00:20:01,674 --> 00:20:02,841
This must be the shop.

585
00:20:02,841 --> 00:20:04,808
- I think so. / - It's the famous pollack roe shop.

586
00:20:04,808 --> 00:20:06,108
I heard this shop is really famous.

587
00:20:07,874 --> 00:20:09,041
Hello.

588
00:20:09,941 --> 00:20:11,908
My gosh, what is this? It's a tube.

589
00:20:11,908 --> 00:20:14,708
Hey, I guess that's pollack roe ice cream.

590
00:20:14,708 --> 00:20:16,074
That's ice cream?

591
00:20:16,074 --> 00:20:17,474
- Pollack roe ice cream? / - That's unique.

592
00:20:18,174 --> 00:20:20,141
I see canned pollack roe too.

593
00:20:20,141 --> 00:20:21,374
- Canned pollack roe is great. / - Looks so good.

594
00:20:21,374 --> 00:20:22,208
Is that alcohol?

595
00:20:22,208 --> 00:20:23,974
They eat pollack roe

596
00:20:23,974 --> 00:20:25,441
out of the tube?

597
00:20:25,441 --> 00:20:26,974
I guess so.

598
00:20:26,974 --> 00:20:29,174
Aren't they like mayonnaise?

599
00:20:29,174 --> 00:20:30,708
The one in the tube?

600
00:20:30,708 --> 00:20:32,241
They are probably flavorful.

601
00:20:32,241 --> 00:20:33,108
I bet it's really good.

602
00:20:33,108 --> 00:20:34,608
Ah, taste...

603
00:20:34,608 --> 00:20:35,741
I bet it's really good.

604
00:20:35,741 --> 00:20:37,274
Ah, taste...

605
00:20:37,974 --> 00:20:39,108
It works?

606
00:20:39,874 --> 00:20:41,474
All you need is rice.

607
00:20:41,474 --> 00:20:42,441
Taste the samples.

608
00:20:42,441 --> 00:20:44,108
- So you can have a meal while you taste. / - Yes.

609
00:20:44,108 --> 00:20:46,841
- Let's try it. / - These are all samples for tasting.

610
00:20:46,841 --> 00:20:48,274
- We can taste them. / - Let's try them.

611
00:20:48,274 --> 00:20:50,508
Original...

612
00:20:50,508 --> 00:20:51,641
Original.

613
00:20:56,041 --> 00:20:57,174
How is it? Is it good?

614
00:20:57,174 --> 00:20:58,274
It's good.

615
00:20:58,274 --> 00:20:59,808
- It's good. / - Is it that good?

616
00:20:59,808 --> 00:21:00,874
It's really good.

617
00:21:00,874 --> 00:21:02,641
Now, I understand why people say

618
00:21:02,641 --> 00:21:05,474
Japanese pollack roe has depth.

619
00:21:05,474 --> 00:21:06,774
Precisely. It tastes like fermented pollack roe.

620
00:21:06,774 --> 00:21:08,041
It's good. It's not bad, right?

621
00:21:08,041 --> 00:21:09,941
It wasn't salty. It was delicious.

622
00:21:09,941 --> 00:21:11,341
It's not that salty either.

623
00:21:11,341 --> 00:21:12,741
This is good.

624
00:21:12,741 --> 00:21:14,208
This one is spicy.

625
00:21:15,174 --> 00:21:16,808
I'm thinking of buying these two.

626
00:21:16,808 --> 00:21:19,008
I'm sure you'll like it too, Jungsoo.

627
00:21:19,008 --> 00:21:20,874
- So pretty. / - I want to taste it. I really do.

628
00:21:20,874 --> 00:21:23,374
They come in tubes too.

629
00:21:23,374 --> 00:21:24,941
- It's convenient. / - That's so good.

630
00:21:28,908 --> 00:21:29,774
Is it delicious?

631
00:21:29,774 --> 00:21:30,641
I can taste the roe.

632
00:21:31,408 --> 00:21:32,574
I can taste the pollack roe.

633
00:21:33,441 --> 00:21:34,541
And it's savory too.

634
00:21:34,541 --> 00:21:36,408
It's easier to eat it when it's in a tube.

635
00:21:36,408 --> 00:21:37,974
Besides, it's not salty at all.

636
00:21:38,908 --> 00:21:40,208
We can just eat it by itself.

637
00:21:42,241 --> 00:21:44,508
- We can just mix it with rice. / - Exactly.

638
00:21:44,508 --> 00:21:46,174
Just squeeze it over the rice.

639
00:21:46,174 --> 00:21:48,274
- Kids will love that. / - You're right.

640
00:21:48,274 --> 00:21:49,008
That's so...

641
00:21:51,208 --> 00:21:51,974
It's tasty.

642
00:21:51,974 --> 00:21:53,174
- It is, isn't it? / - Yes.

643
00:21:53,174 --> 00:21:55,641
- It's similar to the original one. / - You're right.

644
00:21:56,508 --> 00:21:59,274
I liked the one with olive and basil.

645
00:21:59,274 --> 00:22:00,241
Rice?

646
00:22:00,241 --> 00:22:01,741
You can mix it with rice.

647
00:22:01,741 --> 00:22:02,774
You can put it in rolled omelets.

648
00:22:02,774 --> 00:22:04,074
Pasta?

649
00:22:04,874 --> 00:22:06,974
Pasta would taste great with this.

650
00:22:06,974 --> 00:22:09,074
Isn't it salty if you eat that much?

651
00:22:09,074 --> 00:22:12,008
- No, it wasn't. / - It wasn't that salty.

652
00:22:12,008 --> 00:22:13,474
We kept on tasting it.

653
00:22:14,008 --> 00:22:15,274
These would go really well with drinks.

654
00:22:15,874 --> 00:22:16,641
How is it possible?

655
00:22:17,741 --> 00:22:18,808
This is squid.

656
00:22:20,541 --> 00:22:21,908
I should buy this.

657
00:22:21,908 --> 00:22:24,074
- It's cheap too. / - I am going to buy this...

658
00:22:24,874 --> 00:22:27,008
This one and this one.

659
00:22:27,008 --> 00:22:28,874
Thank you.

660
00:22:29,808 --> 00:22:32,974
I made reservations for a hot spring with a great view.

661
00:22:32,974 --> 00:22:33,941
- Really? / - Yes.

662
00:22:33,941 --> 00:22:34,808
- Let's hurry then. / - Let's go.

663
00:22:37,108 --> 00:22:39,374
This is the main event at last.

664
00:22:39,374 --> 00:22:41,308
Right, now that we had our meals.

665
00:22:41,308 --> 00:22:42,474
Ryokan in Karatsu.

666
00:22:42,474 --> 00:22:44,708
The countryside is charming.

667
00:22:44,708 --> 00:22:46,541
- That's so true. / - Rural areas are more charming.

668
00:22:46,541 --> 00:22:49,408
Then how long did it take to get to Karatsu?

669
00:22:49,408 --> 00:22:50,241
It took 1 hour.

670
00:22:50,241 --> 00:22:52,541
- An hour by bus. / - 1 hour by bus.

671
00:22:52,541 --> 00:22:55,808
(This is Karatsu)

672
00:22:55,808 --> 00:22:57,274
Jungah.

673
00:22:57,274 --> 00:22:59,608
- We're walking on a quiet street... / - Seriously.

674
00:22:59,608 --> 00:23:01,174
In the countryside.

675
00:23:01,174 --> 00:23:02,941
There's a ryokan in a place like this?

676
00:23:02,941 --> 00:23:04,541
Yes, but the thing is that...

677
00:23:04,541 --> 00:23:07,074
They are going to pick us up.

678
00:23:07,074 --> 00:23:08,608
- Really? / - I arranged the pick-up service.

679
00:23:08,608 --> 00:23:11,608
- Someone's coming? / - Yes, we have to wait.

680
00:23:11,608 --> 00:23:13,541
But this is such a...

681
00:23:13,541 --> 00:23:15,641
It must be an old Japanese village.

682
00:23:15,641 --> 00:23:16,508
I thought so too.

683
00:23:18,808 --> 00:23:21,174
It's really quiet.

684
00:23:21,708 --> 00:23:22,841
- The weather is great. / - The village...

685
00:23:22,841 --> 00:23:25,374
The village is very peaceful.

686
00:23:26,841 --> 00:23:28,408
I think that must be it.

687
00:23:28,408 --> 00:23:29,608
It's here. It's here.

688
00:23:30,608 --> 00:23:31,908
The ryokan provides...

689
00:23:31,908 --> 00:23:33,774
- Do they provide pick-up service? / - Yes, they do.

690
00:23:33,774 --> 00:23:35,941
I heard that even small ryokans provide...

691
00:23:35,941 --> 00:23:37,208
- A pick-up service. / - Yes, they do indeed.

692
00:23:37,208 --> 00:23:39,008
So it was really convenient.

693
00:23:40,774 --> 00:23:41,741
Come here.

694
00:23:41,741 --> 00:23:42,908
It's an automatic sliding door.

695
00:23:42,908 --> 00:23:44,174
Automatic.

696
00:23:44,874 --> 00:23:46,941
After you book the place,

697
00:23:46,941 --> 00:23:48,408
just request the pick-up service,

698
00:23:48,408 --> 00:23:49,808
and they come and get you.

699
00:23:49,808 --> 00:23:53,441
The van comes to the bus stop you get off at.

700
00:23:53,441 --> 00:23:54,608
It comes to the bus stop.

701
00:23:56,274 --> 00:23:57,541
We are here. This must be the place.

702
00:23:57,541 --> 00:23:58,641
- Is that it? / - Yes.

703
00:23:58,641 --> 00:23:59,841
How pretty.

704
00:23:59,841 --> 00:24:01,208
Thank you so much.

705
00:24:03,508 --> 00:24:04,508
Jungah, this is it.

706
00:24:04,508 --> 00:24:05,208
Let's get off.

707
00:24:06,574 --> 00:24:08,008
It's so pretty.

708
00:24:08,008 --> 00:24:09,241
I can feel the wind from the sea.

709
00:24:09,841 --> 00:24:10,841
It's really breezy.

710
00:24:12,441 --> 00:24:13,374
It looks great.

711
00:24:13,374 --> 00:24:15,908
I know, right? Jungah, look at that. My goodness.

712
00:24:15,908 --> 00:24:18,174
- Should we go inside first? / - Yes, let's do that.

713
00:24:18,174 --> 00:24:19,508
How beautiful.

714
00:24:22,341 --> 00:24:24,241
Hyunjoo, we ought to go there.

715
00:24:24,241 --> 00:24:26,341
How much was the ryokan?

716
00:24:26,341 --> 00:24:27,574
I'm sure it was expensive.

717
00:24:27,574 --> 00:24:29,174
- They're always expensive. / - Ryokans are.

718
00:24:29,174 --> 00:24:31,508
But the price includes dinner

719
00:24:31,508 --> 00:24:33,308
and breakfast.

720
00:24:33,308 --> 00:24:35,374
- That's right. / - Really?

721
00:24:35,941 --> 00:24:36,774
Let's take off our shoes first.

722
00:24:37,708 --> 00:24:38,508
Let's take off our shoes first.

723
00:24:38,508 --> 00:24:39,641
- I should look elegant walking in. / - Haeyeong!

724
00:24:39,641 --> 00:24:40,708
Yes?

725
00:24:40,708 --> 00:24:42,274
- Look at the view. / - My gosh!

726
00:24:43,741 --> 00:24:45,108
I love this!

727
00:24:48,508 --> 00:24:49,841
Actually, that's really cheap.

728
00:24:49,841 --> 00:24:50,941
- Right? / - Yes, yes.

729
00:24:50,941 --> 00:24:51,908
That's so nice.

730
00:24:51,908 --> 00:24:53,274
- It was really clean too. / - Does this make sense?

731
00:24:53,274 --> 00:24:55,241
The view from the room was...

732
00:24:56,441 --> 00:24:57,474
The ocean...

733
00:24:59,308 --> 00:25:00,174
I love this!

734
00:25:03,141 --> 00:25:05,874
This is the best ryokan ever.

735
00:25:05,874 --> 00:25:06,574
This is incredible.

736
00:25:06,574 --> 00:25:07,941
Isn't the view breathtaking?

737
00:25:09,241 --> 00:25:11,041
This is nice!

738
00:25:11,041 --> 00:25:12,641
- This reminds me of... / - This is awesome!

739
00:25:12,641 --> 00:25:14,274
Haeundae in Busan.

740
00:25:14,274 --> 00:25:15,908
- Don't you agree? / - You're right.

741
00:25:15,908 --> 00:25:17,108
This is just so beautiful.

742
00:25:17,108 --> 00:25:18,908
Even the waves are calm.

743
00:25:18,908 --> 00:25:21,341
I can't believe this, Jungah.

744
00:25:21,341 --> 00:25:23,274
It feels like I'm on top of the world.

745
00:25:24,641 --> 00:25:26,474
This is so great.

746
00:25:26,474 --> 00:25:29,741
I've never stayed in a place like this.

747
00:25:29,741 --> 00:25:30,974
Hey, where is it?

748
00:25:30,974 --> 00:25:32,174
Where's the hot spring?

749
00:25:32,174 --> 00:25:33,308
- Let's hurry. / - The hot spring?

750
00:25:33,308 --> 00:25:35,241
I read that there's an

751
00:25:35,241 --> 00:25:36,608
open air hot spring upstairs.

752
00:25:36,608 --> 00:25:37,774
- Open air hot spring? / - Yes.

753
00:25:38,541 --> 00:25:40,274
Seriously. That's a great ryokan.

754
00:25:43,541 --> 00:25:47,041
- We had the sea for our view. / - Seawater pool.

755
00:25:47,041 --> 00:25:48,941
Hyunjoo, you are awfully quiet all of a sudden.

756
00:25:48,941 --> 00:25:50,808
- I want to go there now. / - Excuse me?

757
00:25:50,808 --> 00:25:52,074
- You worked hard, Hyunjoo. / - She wants to go.

758
00:25:52,074 --> 00:25:53,308
- I really want to visit. / - You really want to go there?

759
00:25:53,308 --> 00:25:57,008
It was named as 1 of 100 beautiful views in Japan.

760
00:25:57,008 --> 00:25:59,208
It was 1 of the 100?

761
00:25:59,208 --> 00:26:00,108
That's right.

762
00:26:01,474 --> 00:26:02,508
Hey.

763
00:26:02,508 --> 00:26:03,874
Why is the hot spring so tiny?

764
00:26:08,441 --> 00:26:09,241
Should I go in first?

765
00:26:09,241 --> 00:26:10,041
Should I go in first?

766
00:26:10,041 --> 00:26:11,108
You go in first.

767
00:26:11,108 --> 00:26:12,008
Me first?

768
00:26:13,374 --> 00:26:14,841
It's warm.

769
00:26:14,841 --> 00:26:16,874
Oh, my. The music...

770
00:26:16,874 --> 00:26:18,441
Do they always play this music?

771
00:26:18,441 --> 00:26:19,608
Is it automatic?

772
00:26:19,608 --> 00:26:20,474
Hey.

773
00:26:22,041 --> 00:26:23,008
I feel like I need to dance.

774
00:26:23,008 --> 00:26:23,841
This is almost...

775
00:26:23,841 --> 00:26:26,074
The water isn't as warm as I thought it'd be.

776
00:26:26,674 --> 00:26:27,541
It's hot though.

777
00:26:27,541 --> 00:26:29,208
Because the hot spring here...

778
00:26:31,174 --> 00:26:32,608
I love this. Oh, my.

779
00:26:33,241 --> 00:26:34,841
When I dipped my feet first,

780
00:26:34,841 --> 00:26:37,008
it wasn't that warm.

781
00:26:37,008 --> 00:26:39,074
But as I stayed in the water a bit longer...

782
00:26:39,074 --> 00:26:41,074
- I could feel the heat rising. / - It was warm.

783
00:26:41,074 --> 00:26:42,708
It's so hot!

784
00:26:42,708 --> 00:26:43,541
It's hot?

785
00:26:43,541 --> 00:26:45,174
It's not that hot.

786
00:26:45,174 --> 00:26:46,841
This is nice.

787
00:26:46,841 --> 00:26:47,874
So nice.

788
00:26:47,874 --> 00:26:49,874
Cold above.

789
00:26:50,574 --> 00:26:51,841
And warm below.

790
00:26:53,541 --> 00:26:54,641
Amazing.

791
00:26:54,641 --> 00:27:00,874
(Refreshing air and warm mineral water)

792
00:27:00,874 --> 00:27:03,574
- This is amazing. / - Unbelievable.

793
00:27:04,741 --> 00:27:05,841
Can we use this at night?

794
00:27:05,841 --> 00:27:07,208
Of course we can.

795
00:27:07,208 --> 00:27:09,174
I think we can stay here until 10 p.m.

796
00:27:09,174 --> 00:27:10,708
We should have brought a can of beer.

797
00:27:11,674 --> 00:27:13,574
I'll get you some later.

798
00:27:13,574 --> 00:27:16,441
- Drinking cold sake would be great there. / - Exactly.

799
00:27:18,274 --> 00:27:19,308
You know.

800
00:27:19,308 --> 00:27:20,341
With pollack roe snacks.

801
00:27:22,574 --> 00:27:23,474
Let's get some beer later.

802
00:27:23,474 --> 00:27:24,641
What is that?

803
00:27:25,141 --> 00:27:26,808
With this...

804
00:27:26,808 --> 00:27:28,074
Let me pour it on you.

805
00:27:30,774 --> 00:27:31,841
Like this.

806
00:27:32,974 --> 00:27:34,208
I heard water is excellent here.

807
00:27:35,708 --> 00:27:37,074
This is so sleek.

808
00:27:42,674 --> 00:27:43,941
My skin feels smooth.

809
00:27:43,941 --> 00:27:44,874
- It does, doesn't it? / - Yes.

810
00:27:44,874 --> 00:27:47,108
This is the thing about hot spring.

811
00:27:47,108 --> 00:27:49,041
When you're done, you check your skin once it dries.

812
00:27:49,808 --> 00:27:51,641
When I was in Korea,

813
00:27:51,641 --> 00:27:54,074
I hurt my shoulders while filming a drama.

814
00:27:54,074 --> 00:27:56,808
My shoulders ached a lot.

815
00:27:56,808 --> 00:27:58,008
I'm not lying when I say this.

816
00:27:58,008 --> 00:28:00,374
We did the hot spring on our first day.

817
00:28:00,374 --> 00:28:02,308
- The next day, I didn't feel pain. / - It got better, right?

818
00:28:02,308 --> 00:28:03,741
It got so much better.

819
00:28:03,741 --> 00:28:04,974
Because it helps with circulation

820
00:28:04,974 --> 00:28:08,074
so it can't help but lessen the pain.

821
00:28:08,074 --> 00:28:09,641
- It's a hot spring but... / - It was a mineral hot spring.

822
00:28:09,641 --> 00:28:11,841
- The view is spectacular. / - It improves circulation.

823
00:28:11,841 --> 00:28:13,008
The view...

824
00:28:13,008 --> 00:28:14,341
- It's been so long... / - Since you relaxed?

825
00:28:14,341 --> 00:28:15,141
Yes.

826
00:28:15,141 --> 00:28:16,774
I haven't had time to relax.

827
00:28:25,608 --> 00:28:28,941
Though there are a lot of hot springs in Japan,

828
00:28:28,941 --> 00:28:31,208
we drove here an hour and got to soak in one...

829
00:28:31,208 --> 00:28:34,008
- And see the sea. / - And the ocean.

830
00:28:34,008 --> 00:28:36,308
The view is so nice.

831
00:28:37,208 --> 00:28:38,808
Karatsu is actually very famous

832
00:28:38,808 --> 00:28:45,174
for saltwater hot springs.

833
00:28:45,174 --> 00:28:46,974
It's Karatsu, not Oratsu.

834
00:28:49,008 --> 00:28:51,474
- Stop saying nonsense Japanese. / - Karatsu.

835
00:28:51,474 --> 00:28:52,774
Just because I don't know, you're making...

836
00:28:52,774 --> 00:28:55,441
No, no. It's so you can memorize it easily.

837
00:28:55,441 --> 00:28:56,608
I'm considering you...

838
00:28:56,608 --> 00:28:58,074
Think before you talk.

839
00:28:58,074 --> 00:28:59,374
Think before you talk.

840
00:29:01,141 --> 00:29:02,408
She's so tough.

841
00:29:02,408 --> 00:29:03,608
Think before you talk.

842
00:29:03,608 --> 00:29:04,708
What a great expression.

843
00:29:04,708 --> 00:29:06,041
"Think before you talk."

844
00:29:06,041 --> 00:29:07,408
Think before you talk.

845
00:29:09,974 --> 00:29:11,174
This place is really great.

846
00:29:12,574 --> 00:29:14,574
We get to relax.

847
00:29:14,574 --> 00:29:16,474
It's super close to Korea.

848
00:29:16,474 --> 00:29:17,774
Exactly.

849
00:29:17,774 --> 00:29:19,774
I heard they

850
00:29:19,774 --> 00:29:21,441
serve us delicious dinner here.

851
00:29:21,441 --> 00:29:23,474
Yes. It's a course meal.

852
00:29:24,808 --> 00:29:26,074
I'm so happy.

853
00:29:26,908 --> 00:29:30,141
Let's go and eat the delicious dinner.

854
00:29:31,241 --> 00:29:32,874
Bye!

855
00:29:34,108 --> 00:29:35,641
When you go to your room after a hot bath,

856
00:29:35,641 --> 00:29:37,274
the dinner is already prepared for you.

857
00:29:37,274 --> 00:29:39,374
It's really delicious.

858
00:29:39,374 --> 00:29:40,974
- There's no need to explain. / - It makes you so happy.

859
00:29:40,974 --> 00:29:44,041
Fukuoka is very famous for squid sashimi.

860
00:29:44,041 --> 00:29:45,641
It's coming up.

861
00:29:45,641 --> 00:29:46,741
Squid?

862
00:29:46,741 --> 00:29:52,174
(The first dinner on their trip is kaiseki)

863
00:29:58,308 --> 00:30:00,541
After enjoying a hot bath,

864
00:30:00,541 --> 00:30:02,074
you have a feast.

865
00:30:04,074 --> 00:30:05,374
It's coming up.

866
00:30:05,374 --> 00:30:06,641
Squid?

867
00:30:06,641 --> 00:30:08,508
The squid was so sweet.

868
00:30:08,508 --> 00:30:10,741
- Squid is so tasty. / - It's so delicious.

869
00:30:13,574 --> 00:30:15,141
(Kaiseki is usually a course meal)

870
00:30:15,141 --> 00:30:16,408
(The menu changes seasonally)

871
00:30:17,141 --> 00:30:18,608
Hyunjoo is won over.

872
00:30:18,708 --> 00:30:20,141
Hyunjoo is won over.

873
00:30:21,074 --> 00:30:22,308
Can we eat all of this?

874
00:30:22,308 --> 00:30:23,608
We must.

875
00:30:23,608 --> 00:30:25,241
- It's so pretty. / - It's so pretty.

876
00:30:25,241 --> 00:30:27,241
- Shouldn't we take a picture? / - It's too pretty to eat.

877
00:30:27,241 --> 00:30:28,408
Was it included in the accommodation costs?

878
00:30:28,408 --> 00:30:29,641
- Yes, yes, yes. / - They're included.

879
00:30:29,641 --> 00:30:31,708
Both breakfast and dinner.

880
00:30:32,274 --> 00:30:34,341
I saw people having dinner

881
00:30:34,341 --> 00:30:36,574
with 20 different dishes

882
00:30:36,574 --> 00:30:41,041
after soaking in a hot spring at a ryokan on TV.

883
00:30:41,041 --> 00:30:42,974
- Yeah, yeah. / - I always wanted to try that.

884
00:30:42,974 --> 00:30:44,174
- 20 dishes? / - Yeah.

885
00:30:44,174 --> 00:30:45,541
You're in your 40s.

886
00:30:47,074 --> 00:30:48,941
Can you stop with the dad jokes?

887
00:30:50,208 --> 00:30:51,574
I'll keep doing it if you laugh.

888
00:30:51,574 --> 00:30:53,974
- I know. / - It looks delicious.

889
00:30:53,974 --> 00:30:55,541
Shall we open them one at a time

890
00:30:55,541 --> 00:30:56,608
and see what's inside?

891
00:30:56,608 --> 00:30:57,908
Let's open this.

892
00:30:57,908 --> 00:30:59,041
That one first?

893
00:31:00,108 --> 00:31:02,008
- It's raw fish. / - It's sashimi.

894
00:31:04,208 --> 00:31:05,641
It's warm.

895
00:31:07,208 --> 00:31:08,574
(Ta-da!)

896
00:31:09,174 --> 00:31:11,708
(It looks beautiful)

897
00:31:14,408 --> 00:31:16,441
I think we get to grill this.

898
00:31:16,441 --> 00:31:18,608
- I think so. / - Because we have this.

899
00:31:18,608 --> 00:31:20,441
It looks delicious.

900
00:31:20,441 --> 00:31:23,241
Thanks for a great meal.

901
00:31:24,508 --> 00:31:25,241
It looks delicious.

902
00:31:28,774 --> 00:31:29,574
It's so good.

903
00:31:29,574 --> 00:31:31,274
- The salad is good too. / - It was really good.

904
00:31:31,274 --> 00:31:32,541
It's so pretty.

905
00:31:32,541 --> 00:31:33,741
This is increasing my appetite.

906
00:31:35,508 --> 00:31:36,641
You already have a great appetite.

907
00:31:37,274 --> 00:31:38,274
You already have a great appetite.

908
00:31:38,274 --> 00:31:39,308
She has a good appetite to begin with.

909
00:31:40,074 --> 00:31:42,374
It can't get any better.

910
00:31:42,374 --> 00:31:43,841
How can a salad taste so good?

911
00:31:44,774 --> 00:31:45,774
It's fresh.

912
00:31:48,908 --> 00:31:50,908
- It's nice when actresses eat so well. / - Our skin...

913
00:31:50,908 --> 00:31:53,141
It looks so good after the hot spring, right?

914
00:31:53,141 --> 00:31:53,841
- Yes. / - You're right.

915
00:31:53,841 --> 00:31:56,841
That's without any skin makeup

916
00:31:56,841 --> 00:31:58,274
and it looks so good.

917
00:31:59,074 --> 00:31:59,974
- Haeyeong. / - Yes?

918
00:31:59,974 --> 00:32:00,508
Try the sashimi.

919
00:32:00,508 --> 00:32:01,274
- Is it good? / - Yes.

920
00:32:08,274 --> 00:32:09,408
It's delicious.

921
00:32:10,841 --> 00:32:12,874
You two should talk a little.

922
00:32:12,874 --> 00:32:14,741
- They aren't talking at all. / - Because it's delicious.

923
00:32:14,741 --> 00:32:15,274
True.

924
00:32:15,274 --> 00:32:16,808
You stop talking when it's so delicious.

925
00:32:16,808 --> 00:32:18,508
Aren't I opening too wide like some anglerfish?

926
00:32:19,374 --> 00:32:20,941
- No. / - I'm talking about me.

927
00:32:20,941 --> 00:32:22,041
Not at all.

928
00:32:23,674 --> 00:32:25,208
Isn't the abalone cooked already?

929
00:32:25,208 --> 00:32:27,241
It'll get tough if it's cooked too much.

930
00:32:27,241 --> 00:32:28,974
Gosh, it's abalone.

931
00:32:28,974 --> 00:32:30,108
You should put some salt.

932
00:32:30,108 --> 00:32:31,641
Dip it in the salt!

933
00:32:31,641 --> 00:32:32,774
- Just eat it as is. / - You don't need salt.

934
00:32:32,774 --> 00:32:34,008
- It tastes sweet without it. / - Eat it as is.

935
00:32:34,841 --> 00:32:35,941
I think it's all cooked, isn't it?

936
00:32:36,741 --> 00:32:38,174
All I see is abalone and nothing else.

937
00:32:39,241 --> 00:32:41,241
I just want to have it now.

938
00:32:41,241 --> 00:32:42,941
It's so plump.

939
00:32:44,408 --> 00:32:46,008
It smells roasted.

940
00:32:46,008 --> 00:32:47,108
Shouldn't I dip it in sauce?

941
00:32:47,108 --> 00:32:49,141
Try it as it is first.

942
00:32:52,541 --> 00:32:53,541
Goodness.

943
00:32:53,541 --> 00:32:55,608
I couldn't chew it because it was so firm.

944
00:32:55,608 --> 00:32:56,941
I want some.

945
00:32:59,341 --> 00:33:00,541
The abalone aroma.

946
00:33:01,908 --> 00:33:04,308
The texture is so chewy.

947
00:33:04,308 --> 00:33:05,574
It's so firm.

948
00:33:05,574 --> 00:33:06,241
I'm happy.

949
00:33:07,074 --> 00:33:08,874
We need to grill this.

950
00:33:08,874 --> 00:33:11,008
We need to eat it on that plate.

951
00:33:11,274 --> 00:33:15,141
(The top 3 kaiseki menu, wagyu)

952
00:33:16,474 --> 00:33:17,974
Oh, butter.

953
00:33:17,974 --> 00:33:19,441
It must melt in your mouth.

954
00:33:19,441 --> 00:33:20,241
Right, Jungah?

955
00:33:23,408 --> 00:33:24,608
Put some vegetables.

956
00:33:26,974 --> 00:33:27,908
The smell...

957
00:33:30,941 --> 00:33:31,941
Oh, dear.

958
00:33:33,541 --> 00:33:34,708
It's all done.

959
00:33:34,708 --> 00:33:37,008
- It looks good. / - It looks amazing.

960
00:33:37,008 --> 00:33:38,108
I love that.

961
00:33:38,108 --> 00:33:40,241
- Having a personal grill... / - Exactly.

962
00:33:40,241 --> 00:33:42,041
- And grilling what you want to eat. / - Yes.

963
00:33:42,041 --> 00:33:42,941
Just for you.

964
00:33:42,941 --> 00:33:44,974
- It's so neat. / - It's cute.

965
00:33:44,974 --> 00:33:46,574
That's the Japanese style.

966
00:33:46,574 --> 00:33:47,908
That's right.

967
00:33:47,908 --> 00:33:49,774
Let's eat the meat.

968
00:33:49,774 --> 00:33:52,641
I think we should dip it in this sauce.

969
00:33:52,641 --> 00:33:53,774
Right here.

970
00:33:55,108 --> 00:33:56,874
We can dip it in whatever we want.

971
00:33:58,441 --> 00:34:00,174
I guess you can put some

972
00:34:00,174 --> 00:34:01,508
bread crumbs over it.

973
00:34:08,541 --> 00:34:09,108
It's salty!

974
00:34:09,974 --> 00:34:10,541
It's salty!

975
00:34:11,008 --> 00:34:12,974
Jungah, it's not bread crumbs.

976
00:34:12,974 --> 00:34:14,408
Goodness.

977
00:34:14,408 --> 00:34:15,808
Why would there be bread crumbs?

978
00:34:15,808 --> 00:34:17,541
This is all real.

979
00:34:17,541 --> 00:34:18,941
My goodness.

980
00:34:18,941 --> 00:34:20,708
Haeyeong thought that was bread crumbs.

981
00:34:20,708 --> 00:34:23,008
She dipped so much in it.

982
00:34:23,008 --> 00:34:25,174
I thought the grains were too big to be salt.

983
00:34:26,608 --> 00:34:28,574
I don't believe you.

984
00:34:28,574 --> 00:34:29,474
I can still taste...

985
00:34:30,208 --> 00:34:31,441
The salt chunks.

986
00:34:32,874 --> 00:34:33,774
You drive me nuts.

987
00:34:34,474 --> 00:34:36,574
I thought it was something unique.

988
00:34:36,574 --> 00:34:37,908
It's super salty. Try it.

989
00:34:39,874 --> 00:34:40,808
Does it melt in your mouth?

990
00:34:46,308 --> 00:34:47,074
Hey,

991
00:34:47,074 --> 00:34:48,074
is this meat?

992
00:34:48,841 --> 00:34:50,241
It's amazing.

993
00:34:53,108 --> 00:34:54,141
It's so good.

994
00:34:54,141 --> 00:34:56,274
I'll try dipping it in something else.

995
00:34:56,274 --> 00:34:58,774
You don't even need to chew it.

996
00:34:58,774 --> 00:34:59,774
- It's so tender, isn't it? / - Yes.

997
00:35:00,641 --> 00:35:02,074
- Hey. / - Yes?

998
00:35:02,074 --> 00:35:03,574
Is that squid

999
00:35:03,574 --> 00:35:04,474
for display?

1000
00:35:05,808 --> 00:35:08,141
- That squid sashimi was so good. / - It's really...

1001
00:35:08,141 --> 00:35:09,841
- Chewy, isn't it? / - Yes.

1002
00:35:09,841 --> 00:35:12,074
- Chewy. / - Yes, chewy.

1003
00:35:13,974 --> 00:35:15,841
- It looks good. / - Look at it. It's alive.

1004
00:35:16,408 --> 00:35:18,108
Look at its heart beating. Right?

1005
00:35:18,108 --> 00:35:19,908
I feel bad for eating it.

1006
00:35:19,908 --> 00:35:20,674
Why?

1007
00:35:20,674 --> 00:35:21,741
Because its eyes are open.

1008
00:35:27,108 --> 00:35:28,241
It's delicious.

1009
00:35:29,974 --> 00:35:31,941
- It looks delicious. / - It was.

1010
00:35:32,708 --> 00:35:34,441
Add a little wasabi.

1011
00:35:35,674 --> 00:35:36,341
Wasabi?

1012
00:35:37,408 --> 00:35:41,774
(Don't you think there's too much green on there?)

1013
00:35:46,808 --> 00:35:47,708
Oh, the burn.

1014
00:35:48,341 --> 00:35:49,508
I put too much wasabi.

1015
00:35:50,641 --> 00:35:52,308
Haeyeong, you're driving me crazy.

1016
00:35:52,908 --> 00:35:55,008
It's like you're shooting "2 Days and 1 Night."

1017
00:35:57,508 --> 00:35:58,574
It's like I'm playing game of chance.

1018
00:35:59,941 --> 00:36:00,708
Game of chance.

1019
00:36:04,741 --> 00:36:06,941
It's chewier than the abalone.

1020
00:36:06,941 --> 00:36:09,208
The squid here is so delicious.

1021
00:36:10,441 --> 00:36:11,508
It's sweet.

1022
00:36:11,508 --> 00:36:13,308
The squid was so sweet.

1023
00:36:13,308 --> 00:36:14,808
I'm going there next week.

1024
00:36:14,808 --> 00:36:15,974
- Really? / - So jealous.

1025
00:36:15,974 --> 00:36:17,274
- Try the squid. / - It's close.

1026
00:36:17,274 --> 00:36:18,874
- He can go any time. / - I'll have that squid.

1027
00:36:18,874 --> 00:36:20,141
Goodness.

1028
00:36:20,141 --> 00:36:21,008
It's so sweet.

1029
00:36:21,741 --> 00:36:22,741
My goodness.

1030
00:36:27,474 --> 00:36:28,674
The abalone was good

1031
00:36:28,674 --> 00:36:30,241
but the squid is much better.

1032
00:36:30,241 --> 00:36:30,874
It's sweet.

1033
00:36:30,874 --> 00:36:31,574
- Isn't it? / - Yeah.

1034
00:36:31,574 --> 00:36:32,608
It melts in your mouth.

1035
00:36:33,741 --> 00:36:35,041
It's so good!

1036
00:36:36,308 --> 00:36:37,641
I'm happy that you're happy.

1037
00:36:39,341 --> 00:36:40,341
That one, that one!

1038
00:36:40,341 --> 00:36:43,008
They fry the leftover squid.

1039
00:36:43,008 --> 00:36:45,741
- You dip that in salt, right? / - Yes.

1040
00:36:45,741 --> 00:36:46,841
That must be salt too.

1041
00:36:47,808 --> 00:36:48,408
Salt?

1042
00:36:48,408 --> 00:36:50,008
It's curry salt.

1043
00:36:50,008 --> 00:36:51,274
Oh, curry salt.

1044
00:36:51,274 --> 00:36:52,541
Dip it in that.

1045
00:36:53,341 --> 00:36:55,241
I think I should be careful.

1046
00:36:55,241 --> 00:36:57,641
I don't want to dip it in something weird.

1047
00:36:57,641 --> 00:36:58,641
I'll try it.

1048
00:36:59,308 --> 00:37:00,408
- I'll... / - Salt.

1049
00:37:02,241 --> 00:37:03,708
I'll taste it first for you.

1050
00:37:07,874 --> 00:37:08,974
It's salt.

1051
00:37:08,974 --> 00:37:09,841
It's curry salt.

1052
00:37:09,841 --> 00:37:10,541
It's salt again.

1053
00:37:10,541 --> 00:37:12,841
- After that, Haeyeong... / - What's with Haeyeong?

1054
00:37:12,841 --> 00:37:14,608
She became paranoid about salt.

1055
00:37:14,608 --> 00:37:16,074
- Did you put too much again? / - Yeah.

1056
00:37:16,074 --> 00:37:18,208
I told you to be careful.

1057
00:37:18,208 --> 00:37:19,141
I thought it was curry.

1058
00:37:22,241 --> 00:37:23,908
It was delicious though.

1059
00:37:23,908 --> 00:37:26,274
You dip a tempura in salt when it's hot.

1060
00:37:26,274 --> 00:37:27,108
- Like that. / - That's right.

1061
00:37:27,108 --> 00:37:28,341
It's so good.

1062
00:37:28,341 --> 00:37:30,674
It's seasoned inside.

1063
00:37:31,874 --> 00:37:33,708
Right? This is seasoned, right?

1064
00:37:33,708 --> 00:37:34,741
The coat is seasoned.

1065
00:37:36,274 --> 00:37:38,541
- It's delicious fried. / - If it's good raw...

1066
00:37:38,541 --> 00:37:39,408
It's going to be good fried.

1067
00:37:39,408 --> 00:37:40,408
- Gosh. / - There it is.

1068
00:37:41,041 --> 00:37:42,374
That...

1069
00:37:42,374 --> 00:37:43,008
No way.

1070
00:37:43,008 --> 00:37:44,808
You have to drink beer with fried squid.

1071
00:37:47,941 --> 00:37:49,408
Like drinking water...

1072
00:37:49,408 --> 00:37:51,274
That should've been served before the fried squid.

1073
00:37:51,274 --> 00:37:53,074
- It was so good. / - That must've been so good.

1074
00:37:53,074 --> 00:37:55,041
That makes you refreshed, even to your stomach.

1075
00:37:56,374 --> 00:37:57,474
Does it quench your thirst?

1076
00:37:58,274 --> 00:38:00,608
- We were in a hot spring earlier. / - Exactly.

1077
00:38:01,041 --> 00:38:04,041
- We've been thirsty. / - I really wanted a cold beer.

1078
00:38:04,341 --> 00:38:07,774
Drinking beer after taking a hot bath and sweating...

1079
00:38:07,774 --> 00:38:09,574
It was so great.

1080
00:38:10,174 --> 00:38:11,308
I'm looking forward to tomorrow.

1081
00:38:12,174 --> 00:38:13,974
I keep eating when I'm full.

1082
00:38:13,974 --> 00:38:14,908
I can't stop eating.

1083
00:38:18,141 --> 00:38:20,008
It was good, right?

1084
00:38:21,141 --> 00:38:25,341
We know that it's nice but we're still jealous to see it.

1085
00:38:25,341 --> 00:38:26,041
That's right.

1086
00:38:26,041 --> 00:38:28,108
I've never been to Fukuoka.

1087
00:38:28,108 --> 00:38:29,341
It was also my first time.

1088
00:38:29,341 --> 00:38:31,874
But people recommended it to me a lot.

1089
00:38:31,874 --> 00:38:33,074
It's nice to know where

1090
00:38:33,074 --> 00:38:35,308
I should go and what I should eat.

1091
00:38:35,808 --> 00:38:37,708
Hyunjoo, are you crying?

1092
00:38:39,208 --> 00:38:40,574
Your eyes are teary.

1093
00:38:40,574 --> 00:38:43,974
I was so confident.

1094
00:38:43,974 --> 00:38:45,474
But after watching their video...

1095
00:38:45,474 --> 00:38:48,108
No, no. Not so for me.

1096
00:38:48,641 --> 00:38:50,641
To go with family...

1097
00:38:50,641 --> 00:38:52,841
Nha Trang is better.

1098
00:38:53,974 --> 00:38:56,241
Let's see the second-half of Fukuoka.

1099
00:38:56,241 --> 00:38:57,741
Everyone, let's go to Fukuoka.

1101
00:39:02,041 --> 00:39:03,608
It's a different feel here.

1102
00:39:03,608 --> 00:39:04,674
It's so pretty.

1103
00:39:04,674 --> 00:39:07,008
There are more than 28 hot springs here.

1104
00:39:07,008 --> 00:39:08,641
This is awesome.

1105
00:39:08,641 --> 00:39:10,674
Hot springs are so nice.

1106
00:39:10,974 --> 00:39:12,174
We'll have beautiful skin.

1107
00:39:12,174 --> 00:39:14,408
I think we were in the hot spring for too long.

1108
00:39:14,408 --> 00:39:15,441
Aren't you hungry?

1109
00:39:15,441 --> 00:39:17,274
- Looks so good. / - Yakiniku.

1110
00:39:17,908 --> 00:39:19,441
I've never tasted this before.

1111
00:39:19,441 --> 00:39:21,241
We really did a full tour of Fukuoka.

1112
00:39:21,241 --> 00:39:21,908
Yeah.

1113
00:39:21,908 --> 00:39:23,274
Fuku, Fuku.

00:39:37,008 --> 00:39:39,741
Everything looks so peaceful.

1119
00:39:39,741 --> 00:39:42,641
Are we going to a hot spring first?

1120
00:39:42,641 --> 00:39:46,108
We have to head to Kurokawa by bus.

1121
00:39:46,108 --> 00:39:47,441
Okay. Let's go.

1122
00:39:49,308 --> 00:39:52,508
(2.5 hours by bus to Kurokawa Hot Spring Village)

1123
00:39:52,508 --> 00:39:55,608
You can use that pass to go to Kurokawa, right?

1124
00:39:55,608 --> 00:39:57,908
Yes, the SUNQ pass.

1125
00:39:57,908 --> 00:39:59,374
You can go everywhere.

1126
00:39:59,374 --> 00:40:01,041
- For 3 days. / - That's nice.

1127
00:40:01,041 --> 00:40:08,074

00:40:30,708 --> 00:40:33,774
(This small village has a very relaxing atmosphere)

1132
00:40:37,641 --> 00:40:40,174
That was a long journey, wasn't it?

1133
00:40:40,174 --> 00:40:41,674
Yes, it was hard to come here. Where are we?

1134
00:40:41,674 --> 00:40:43,474
- Kurokawa? / - Since they're actresses...

1135
00:40:43,474 --> 00:40:44,908
It feels like a drama.

1136
00:40:44,908 --> 00:40:45,774
You're right.

1137
00:40:45,774 --> 00:40:49,874
We came here from Karatsu...

1138
00:40:49,874 --> 00:40:51,641
You go to Karatsu now.

1139
00:40:52,574 --> 00:40:53,408
(Turning his back)

1140
00:40:53,408 --> 00:40:56,074
- This won't do. / - She only makes dad jokes.

1141
00:40:56,074 --> 00:40:57,708
It's really not funny when I see it here.

1142
00:40:57,708 --> 00:40:59,774
You go to Karatsu now.

1146
00:41:05,208 --> 00:41:08,541
- Has a different feel to the other place. / - Totally.

1147
00:41:08,541 --> 00:41:12,441
- This place is like... / - It feels like...

1148
00:41:12,441 --> 00:41:14,408
Seoraksan in Korea.

1149
00:41:14,408 --> 00:41:16,774
Right? This is a secret course.

1150
00:41:16,774 --> 00:41:20,341
It will be hard for Korean tourists to find this place.

1151
00:41:20,341 --> 00:41:22,441
The location was too secretive.

1152
00:41:22,441 --> 00:41:23,874
They'll start going now.

1153
00:41:23,874 --> 00:41:24,674
I'd better hurry.

1154
00:41:24,674 --> 00:41:27,641
Following Yufuin and Beppu,

1155
00:41:27,641 --> 00:41:30,141
Kurokawa is the next famous place.

1156
00:41:30,141 --> 00:41:33,474
A lot of Koreans who found this place

1157
00:41:33,474 --> 00:41:35,274
are starting to come here a lot.

1158
00:41:35,274 --> 00:41:38,941
This place is still fairly unknown, isn't it?

1159
00:41:38,941 --> 00:41:42,741
It's starting to get famous.

1160
00:41:42,741 --> 00:41:45,708
We have to buy a secret

1161
00:41:45,708 --> 00:41:47,574
that will allow us to be here.

1162
00:41:47,574 --> 00:41:49,508
- Is it this thing? / - The medal.

1163
00:41:49,508 --> 00:41:53,041
- Here too? / - Medal.

1164
00:41:53,508 --> 00:41:55,574
This place is a hot springs village.

1165
00:41:55,574 --> 00:41:59,174
There are more than 28 hot springs here.

1166
00:41:59,174 --> 00:42:04,308
We can go to about three of them

1167
00:42:04,308 --> 00:42:05,841
with this medal.

1168
00:42:05,841 --> 00:42:08,774
Normally, to go to one hot spring,

1169
00:42:08,774 --> 00:42:10,374
it costs 500 to 700 yen.

1170
00:42:11,074 --> 00:42:13,908
So three would cost at least 1,500 yen.

1171
00:42:13,908 --> 00:42:15,941
That's why you were up last night. You were studying.

1172
00:42:15,941 --> 00:42:17,808
Come here. Let's ask the information desk.

1173
00:42:17,808 --> 00:42:18,608
Let's go.

1174
00:42:20,241 --> 00:42:21,608
I'm saying it's cheaper this way.

1175
00:42:22,608 --> 00:42:24,308
Hello.

1176
00:42:25,674 --> 00:42:27,574
- The medal? / - The medal.

1177
00:42:27,808 --> 00:42:28,874
One medal please.

1178
00:42:31,641 --> 00:42:33,874
- It looks like a medal. / - It does.

1179
00:42:33,874 --> 00:42:35,174
- Thank you. / - Thank you.

1180
00:42:35,174 --> 00:42:37,141
That seems fun. You will take it with you everywhere.

1181
00:42:37,141 --> 00:42:39,208
Yes. They give you a stamp

1182
00:42:39,208 --> 00:42:40,874
when you use the hot springs.

1183
00:42:42,041 --> 00:42:44,841
There are ryokans here.

1184
00:42:44,841 --> 00:42:46,441
It's possible to lodge here.

1185
00:42:49,341 --> 00:42:50,574
It's pretty.

1186
00:42:51,341 --> 00:42:52,241
That's so nice.

1187
00:42:53,474 --> 00:42:55,974
The entire neighborhood is a hot spring village.

1188
00:42:55,974 --> 00:42:57,441
- What is that? / - Isn't it so pretty?

1189
00:42:57,441 --> 00:42:59,708
- It'd be so nice when it snows in winter. / - Yes.

1190
00:42:59,708 --> 00:43:01,741
It's nice for all four season.

1191
00:43:01,741 --> 00:43:02,441
What is that place?

1192
00:43:02,941 --> 00:43:04,741
The sound of the flowing water is so nice.

1193
00:43:04,741 --> 00:43:08,008
- I know. / - All diseases would be healed here.

1194
00:43:08,841 --> 00:43:11,108
Jungah, it smells lovely.

1195
00:43:11,974 --> 00:43:15,174
The smell of the forest is so nice.

1196
00:43:15,174 --> 00:43:17,041
My goodness. This fragrance.

1197
00:43:17,041 --> 00:43:18,174
It's a fragrance.

1198
00:43:18,174 --> 00:43:21,841
I liked Karatsu yesterday

1199
00:43:21,841 --> 00:43:24,874
but I like this place much better.

1200
00:43:24,874 --> 00:43:29,841
This hot spring village is so nice and beautiful.

1201
00:43:30,541 --> 00:43:32,074
The village itself is really pretty.

1202
00:43:32,074 --> 00:43:34,674
It was really pretty. Hot spring villages are great.

1203
00:43:34,674 --> 00:43:36,174
Check out the foliage.

1204
00:43:38,808 --> 00:43:39,741
It's pretty.

1205
00:43:40,674 --> 00:43:42,441
I didn't know that there was a place like this.

1206
00:43:42,441 --> 00:43:44,974
- I can't help but compare it with yesterday. / - I know.

1207
00:43:44,974 --> 00:43:48,941
It's so charming and cute. It feels like a dwarf village.

1208
00:43:48,941 --> 00:43:50,641
That's a good way to put it.

1209
00:43:50,641 --> 00:43:53,308
It's a dwarf village. There's quite a bit of tourists.

1210
00:43:53,308 --> 00:43:54,474
I know.

1211
00:43:55,008 --> 00:43:56,608
I can't believe how cute and

1212
00:43:56,608 --> 00:43:59,041
pretty the stores are here.

1213
00:43:59,041 --> 00:44:00,641
Aren't they so pretty?

1214
00:44:00,641 --> 00:44:03,074
Japan has a lot of cute things like these.

1215
00:44:03,074 --> 00:44:04,241
Look. What is this?

1216
00:44:05,174 --> 00:44:06,774
What kind of place is this?

1217
00:44:08,641 --> 00:44:09,674
Haeyeong.

1218
00:44:10,808 --> 00:44:12,874
Haeyeong, this must be...

1219
00:44:12,874 --> 00:44:14,074
A foot bath.

1220
00:44:14,774 --> 00:44:15,974
This is nice.

1221
00:44:15,974 --> 00:44:17,408
Can you use that for free?

1222
00:44:17,408 --> 00:44:19,741
- If you pay $1. / - That's cheap.

1223
00:44:22,808 --> 00:44:25,074
Check out the sound of the river.

1224
00:44:26,241 --> 00:44:27,374
It's so nice.

1225
00:44:30,241 --> 00:44:31,641
All my stress is being relieved.

1226
00:44:32,841 --> 00:44:35,074
I hope the swelling in your legs goes down.

1227
00:44:36,008 --> 00:44:39,174
Relieving our legs as soon as we arrive,

1228
00:44:39,174 --> 00:44:42,408
then hitting the hot springs.

1229
00:44:43,374 --> 00:44:46,408
We have to go to several places.

1230
00:44:46,408 --> 00:44:47,808
Let's go out now.

1231
00:44:49,608 --> 00:44:50,674
That was a good foot bath.

1232
00:44:50,674 --> 00:44:52,608
I feel hot after that.

1233
00:44:52,608 --> 00:44:54,974
- I'm hot. / - We're recharged now.

1234
00:44:54,974 --> 00:44:56,474
If you book the accommodation there...

1235
00:44:56,474 --> 00:44:59,008
- You can sleep and eat there. / - Yes.

1236
00:44:59,008 --> 00:45:01,408
If you book here

1237
00:45:01,408 --> 00:45:02,908
and don't go to Karatsu...

1238
00:45:02,908 --> 00:45:05,341
- You'll save 2 hours. / - That's good too.

1239
00:45:06,541 --> 00:45:08,541
- This must be the place. / - Is this the place?

1240
00:45:08,541 --> 00:45:11,541
- This must be... / - This must be a temple.

1241
00:45:12,308 --> 00:45:14,974
Look here. They tied up something here.

1242
00:45:14,974 --> 00:45:18,441
People hung their wishes here.

1243
00:45:18,441 --> 00:45:19,741
That's right.

1244
00:45:19,741 --> 00:45:20,374
Oh, my.

1245
00:45:21,574 --> 00:45:23,408
- There are a lot hung here. / - That's right.

1246
00:45:24,141 --> 00:45:25,574
Okay.

1247
00:45:25,574 --> 00:45:27,274
You can put in as much money as you want?

1248
00:45:27,274 --> 00:45:28,308
Yes.

1249
00:45:30,174 --> 00:45:31,041
Try it.

1250
00:45:31,608 --> 00:45:33,574
I hope it has something good written on it.

1251
00:45:35,641 --> 00:45:36,441
I picked one.

1252
00:45:36,441 --> 00:45:37,508
- You did? / - Yeah.

1253
00:45:37,508 --> 00:45:39,074
- Should I read it? / - Yes.

1254
00:45:40,741 --> 00:45:41,274
Goodness.

1255
00:45:41,974 --> 00:45:43,174
- Goodness. / - Don't worry.

1256
00:45:44,141 --> 00:45:45,441
I tore it too before.

1257
00:45:46,474 --> 00:45:47,908
It'll only have good words.

1258
00:45:47,908 --> 00:45:49,574
There's something written here.

1259
00:45:52,874 --> 00:45:54,708
Great...

1260
00:45:55,441 --> 00:45:56,974
Great luck!

1261
00:45:58,241 --> 00:45:59,774
What does it say here?

1262
00:45:59,774 --> 00:46:01,608
It's the best one there is.

1263
00:46:04,374 --> 00:46:05,374
Why?

1264
00:46:05,374 --> 00:46:07,208
Is it really the best one?

1265
00:46:07,208 --> 00:46:08,674
Great luck was the best one.

1266
00:46:08,674 --> 00:46:10,474
They have small luck, good luck and great luck.

1267
00:46:10,474 --> 00:46:12,041
Great luck was the best.

1268
00:46:14,374 --> 00:46:15,774
Sure this is great luck?

1269
00:46:15,774 --> 00:46:17,541
You have hope with relationships.

1270
00:46:18,274 --> 00:46:20,941
And you'll get as much work as the effort you put in.

1271
00:46:20,941 --> 00:46:22,474
You'd better work hard.

1272
00:46:22,474 --> 00:46:24,108
Really?

1273
00:46:24,108 --> 00:46:25,108
Thank you.

1274
00:46:25,108 --> 00:46:26,941
There's no luck. You just have to work hard.

1275
00:46:28,474 --> 00:46:29,841
Don't ask for luck...

1276
00:46:29,841 --> 00:46:31,141
In life.

1277
00:46:31,141 --> 00:46:33,808
I'm saying my life is like that.

1278
00:46:33,808 --> 00:46:35,074
Right.

1279
00:46:35,074 --> 00:46:37,574
You pick too since I picked one.

1280
00:46:37,574 --> 00:46:38,974
I'll pay $1.

1281
00:46:40,908 --> 00:46:41,941
Pick a good one.

1282
00:46:41,941 --> 00:46:42,974
I don't think it will be good.

1283
00:46:42,974 --> 00:46:43,808
What are you talking about?

1284
00:46:43,808 --> 00:46:45,408
If one person is lucky, the other person usually isn't.

1285
00:46:45,408 --> 00:46:46,474
It's fun that way.

1286
00:46:46,474 --> 00:46:47,508
I'll hold this so open it.

1287
00:46:47,508 --> 00:46:48,808
What if hers is very great luck?

1288
00:46:50,074 --> 00:46:52,508
The ones with great luck are all the same.

1289
00:46:54,708 --> 00:46:55,774
Is this really great luck?

1290
00:46:56,308 --> 00:46:58,508
(It is great luck)

1291
00:46:58,508 --> 00:47:00,274
They say it's hard to pick great luck.

1292
00:47:00,274 --> 00:47:02,174
- It's easy to get great luck. / - Yeah, this one!

1293
00:47:02,974 --> 00:47:03,708
What's this?

1294
00:47:03,708 --> 00:47:06,008
(Narae and Gukju's Hokkaido trip)

1295
00:47:06,008 --> 00:47:07,641
Great luck!

1296
00:47:08,041 --> 00:47:09,674
- It's all great luck. / - They all got it.

1297
00:47:09,674 --> 00:47:11,541
Great luck has been common.

1298
00:47:12,741 --> 00:47:14,774
I got great luck.

1299
00:47:15,541 --> 00:47:18,241
I got great, great, great luck.

1300
00:47:20,608 --> 00:47:22,908
My goodness. There's such a thing?

1301
00:47:23,874 --> 00:47:24,808
What is this?

1302
00:47:26,908 --> 00:47:27,608
Let's go.

1303
00:47:27,608 --> 00:47:29,874
Why did they hang these?

1304
00:47:29,874 --> 00:47:32,341
Those must be unlucky results.

1305
00:47:34,408 --> 00:47:35,841
They hang them back up?

1306
00:47:37,074 --> 00:47:39,041
Aren't they all good?

1307
00:47:39,041 --> 00:47:39,708
Right?

1308
00:47:39,708 --> 00:47:43,508
- No, he said it's rare. / - How did we get so lucky?

1309
00:47:44,274 --> 00:47:47,508
Honestly, I feel like we're very lucky

1310
00:47:47,508 --> 00:47:49,974
to be on this trip.

1311
00:47:50,474 --> 00:47:52,174
Let's be thankful for the small things.

1312
00:47:53,408 --> 00:47:55,108
Let's be thankful for the small things.

1313
00:47:55,108 --> 00:47:56,208
Oh, my!

1314
00:47:56,208 --> 00:47:58,474
She tore it while trying to tie it on.

1315
00:47:58,474 --> 00:47:59,341
Oh, my God.

1316
00:48:02,574 --> 00:48:03,308
Oh, my God.

1317
00:48:03,308 --> 00:48:04,441
Why?

1318
00:48:05,374 --> 00:48:07,541
I tore it because of that bug.

1319
00:48:08,008 --> 00:48:10,141
What do I do?

1320
00:48:10,141 --> 00:48:12,108
- Darn it. / - It's okay, tie it up again.

1321
00:48:12,108 --> 00:48:14,441
Nice, Haeyeong. Using spit as glue.

1322
00:48:18,008 --> 00:48:20,874
This is just for fun.

1323
00:48:20,874 --> 00:48:22,308
I don't believe this.

1324
00:48:23,308 --> 00:48:24,474
All done.

1325
00:48:24,474 --> 00:48:25,841
Good job.

1326
00:48:25,841 --> 00:48:27,408
You did a really good job.

1327
00:48:28,841 --> 00:48:31,908
Ours. This is yours, this is mine.

1328
00:48:32,074 --> 00:48:34,008
This is my one.

1329
00:48:34,974 --> 00:48:37,541
These are the little things that make it fun.

1330
00:48:37,541 --> 00:48:38,641
It's really quiet.

1331
00:48:38,641 --> 00:48:40,974
All of the alleys are really cute.

1332
00:48:42,274 --> 00:48:43,641
Wow.

1333
00:48:43,641 --> 00:48:44,408
Check out the bakery.

1334
00:48:44,408 --> 00:48:48,374
This must be the bread that the others were eating.

1335
00:48:48,374 --> 00:48:52,174
Hello, this must be famous.

1336
00:48:52,174 --> 00:48:53,308
- Were they Korean? / - Yes.

1337
00:48:53,308 --> 00:48:56,474
This must be what we've been hearing about.

1338
00:48:56,474 --> 00:48:58,174
Let's try it.

1339
00:48:58,174 --> 00:49:00,008
- Looks delicious. / - The smell...

1340
00:49:02,774 --> 00:49:06,174
It's custard bread.

1341
00:49:06,174 --> 00:49:08,474
It's a famous custard bread.

1342
00:49:08,474 --> 00:49:10,874
- Looks so good. / - They sell those in Korea now...

1343
00:49:10,874 --> 00:49:11,808
Don't they?

1344
00:49:13,508 --> 00:49:15,008
Give me one.

1345
00:49:16,174 --> 00:49:17,574
Thank you.

1346
00:49:17,574 --> 00:49:18,341
Let's go.

1347
00:49:19,008 --> 00:49:21,241
- We bought it. / - Let's eat it over there.

1348
00:49:21,241 --> 00:49:22,308
Sit over there?

1349
00:49:22,308 --> 00:49:24,241
Where we can hear the water.

1350
00:49:24,874 --> 00:49:26,074
What is this?

1351
00:49:27,174 --> 00:49:28,374
What is this?

1352
00:49:28,374 --> 00:49:29,174
What is that thing?

1353
00:49:29,974 --> 00:49:31,341
Isn't that a hot spring?

1354
00:49:31,341 --> 00:49:33,074
I think you steam your face here.

1355
00:49:35,508 --> 00:49:36,508
What? Is there steam?

1356
00:49:36,508 --> 00:49:38,108
- It's steaming. / - Let me see.

1357
00:49:38,108 --> 00:49:40,808
Wait. Put this down first. You'll spill it.

1358
00:49:41,341 --> 00:49:44,041
- It smells like sulfur. / - It smells like sulfur...

1359
00:49:46,941 --> 00:49:49,074
I think it's a place where you steam your face.

1360
00:49:49,074 --> 00:49:49,874
I guess so.

1361
00:49:49,874 --> 00:49:51,074
It smells a little.

1362
00:49:52,541 --> 00:49:54,474
This is called a kaoyu.

1363
00:49:54,474 --> 00:49:57,408
It's also very good for your eyes.

1364
00:49:59,474 --> 00:50:00,808
Since it's a sulfur hot spring...

1365
00:50:00,808 --> 00:50:02,641
- This is nice. / - Wait a minute.

1366
00:50:02,641 --> 00:50:03,941
It's so cute and small.

1367
00:50:03,941 --> 00:50:06,041
There's a table for us too.

1368
00:50:06,041 --> 00:50:07,174
Here, Haeyeong.

1369
00:50:07,174 --> 00:50:09,108
Thank you.

1370
00:50:10,008 --> 00:50:11,241
It looks delicious.

1371
00:50:12,274 --> 00:50:13,241
I was hungry.

1372
00:50:15,174 --> 00:50:16,274
Is it good?

1373
00:50:18,974 --> 00:50:21,508
There's custard inside.

1374
00:50:23,174 --> 00:50:24,174
Look at this.

1375
00:50:24,808 --> 00:50:26,041
Wow.

1376
00:50:26,041 --> 00:50:27,774
- It's good. / - It looks good.

1377
00:50:28,641 --> 00:50:30,508
(With plenty of custard)

1378
00:50:36,108 --> 00:50:37,908
- Isn't it good? / - Yes.

1379
00:50:37,908 --> 00:50:41,774
The custard is moist and cool.

1380
00:50:41,774 --> 00:50:43,108
And it's really savory.

1381
00:50:43,774 --> 00:50:45,574
The custard isn't really sweet.

1382
00:50:45,574 --> 00:50:46,574
It was savory.

1383
00:50:46,574 --> 00:50:48,441
In Korea, custard bread is soft

1384
00:50:48,441 --> 00:50:49,308
on the inside and outside.

1385
00:50:49,308 --> 00:50:51,808
- That's right. / - But this was crispy on the outside.

1386
00:50:51,808 --> 00:50:55,841
This is really crispy and savory.

1387
00:50:56,408 --> 00:50:57,308
It's really good.

1388
00:51:00,341 --> 00:51:02,308
Please show us a proper reaction.

1389
00:51:02,308 --> 00:51:04,508
These people become silent when they eat.

1390
00:51:04,508 --> 00:51:05,841
All they do is eat.

1391
00:51:14,008 --> 00:51:16,874
You have to eat it right away after buying it.

1392
00:51:16,874 --> 00:51:18,774
- It will get soggy if you don't. / - You're right.

1393
00:51:18,774 --> 00:51:21,608
- You have to eat bread right after it's made. / - Yeah.

1394
00:51:25,341 --> 00:51:27,808
We're starting to enter the hot spring village.

1395
00:51:27,808 --> 00:51:29,341
This is the first hot spring.

1396
00:51:32,474 --> 00:51:33,474
Jungah.

1397
00:51:33,474 --> 00:51:35,574
We're finally at a hot spring.

1398
00:51:35,574 --> 00:51:37,808
It's so pretty.

1399
00:51:37,808 --> 00:51:40,541
It's here.

1400
00:51:40,541 --> 00:51:42,641
We'll start from here.

1401
00:51:43,374 --> 00:51:44,308
I'm so pretty.

1402
00:51:45,374 --> 00:51:46,874
The entrance is so pretty.

1403
00:51:46,874 --> 00:51:49,841
- It's like entering a fairy's house. / - You're right.

1404
00:51:49,841 --> 00:51:52,308
We came at the perfect season.

1405
00:51:52,308 --> 00:51:53,508
I know.

1406
00:51:53,508 --> 00:51:55,841
Won't it be hard to visit all 3 hot springs in a day?

1407
00:51:55,841 --> 00:51:57,974
We thought it would be hard too,

1408
00:51:57,974 --> 00:52:01,474
but people stay in a spring for only 10 to 15 minutes.

1409
00:52:01,474 --> 00:52:03,374
Because there are so many to experience.

1410
00:52:03,374 --> 00:52:04,641
Hello.

1411
00:52:06,208 --> 00:52:07,908
Ryokan.

1412
00:52:14,041 --> 00:52:16,941
(They finally receive their first stamp)

1413
00:52:16,941 --> 00:52:19,108
We're going to receive the stamps like this.

1414
00:52:21,374 --> 00:52:24,474
Look, we're going to start from here.

1415
00:52:24,474 --> 00:52:25,541
Let's go in.

1416
00:52:27,108 --> 00:52:28,841
Can you pay more to get into

1417
00:52:28,841 --> 00:52:30,341
more than three hot springs?

1418
00:52:30,341 --> 00:52:32,608
That's right. You can buy another medal.

1419
00:52:32,608 --> 00:52:35,108
It's cheaper if you buy three

1420
00:52:35,108 --> 00:52:37,241
instead of one.

1421
00:52:40,041 --> 00:52:42,908
- It's not right at the entrance. / - It's a little secluded.

1422
00:52:42,908 --> 00:52:46,541
That's right. I heard that Japanese celebrities

1423
00:52:46,541 --> 00:52:48,674
have secret love affairs here.

1424
00:52:48,674 --> 00:52:50,241
Really?

1425
00:52:50,241 --> 00:52:54,141
Famous celebrities come here...

1426
00:52:54,141 --> 00:52:56,641
- To use the hot springs. / - Is it their secret location?

1427
00:52:56,641 --> 00:53:00,341
It's their secret location. This place is a little bit...

1428
00:53:00,341 --> 00:53:02,341
- More secluded from the entire village. / - Right.

1429
00:53:02,341 --> 00:53:04,541
- They come here in secret. / - It's very private.

1430
00:53:04,541 --> 00:53:05,408
Very private.

1431
00:53:05,408 --> 00:53:08,108
It's a really famous hot spring.

1432
00:53:08,108 --> 00:53:10,708
You can enjoy it while standing.

1433
00:53:10,708 --> 00:53:11,874
I was shocked.

1434
00:53:11,874 --> 00:53:13,674
I almost got on it thinking that it was a swing.

1435
00:53:14,141 --> 00:53:18,108
(There is something special here in this hot spring)

1436
00:53:19,641 --> 00:53:23,974
(A hot spring where you enjoy while standing)

1437
00:53:23,974 --> 00:53:26,208
(There are only two of them in Kurokawa)

1438
00:53:26,208 --> 00:53:29,174
(This one is the deepest one)

1439
00:53:29,174 --> 00:53:30,941
It's deep.

1440
00:53:32,241 --> 00:53:33,674
You need to hold this.

1441
00:53:34,341 --> 00:53:35,941
Oh, it's hot!

1442
00:53:37,841 --> 00:53:39,608
It's not hot if you come in completely.

1443
00:53:39,608 --> 00:53:41,508
We're shooting right now,

1444
00:53:41,508 --> 00:53:42,808
but do you have to wear a bathing suit?

1445
00:53:42,808 --> 00:53:45,974
- Or go in naked? / - You're supposed to be naked.

1446
00:53:46,274 --> 00:53:49,041
- Is it a mixed bath? / - No, it isn't.

1447
00:53:50,008 --> 00:53:51,508
It's so deep.

1448
00:53:51,508 --> 00:53:53,208
This must be a handle.

1449
00:53:53,208 --> 00:53:54,574
I thought it was a swing.

1450
00:53:54,574 --> 00:53:56,541
I was going to try it.

1451
00:53:59,408 --> 00:54:01,441
What if this breaks?

1452
00:54:01,941 --> 00:54:04,008
- This is so fun. / - It seems nice.

1453
00:54:06,041 --> 00:54:08,841
I feel less tired standing

1454
00:54:08,841 --> 00:54:11,474
than sitting in a tub.

1455
00:54:11,474 --> 00:54:14,074
I'm less dizzy.

1456
00:54:14,074 --> 00:54:16,641
It feels good hanging from here.

1457
00:54:16,641 --> 00:54:18,708
You feel less tired when you're standing there.

1458
00:54:19,608 --> 00:54:23,108
I like saunas, so I am loving this.

1459
00:54:23,974 --> 00:54:25,374
My skin feels so nice right now.

1460
00:54:25,374 --> 00:54:29,908
This place is bigger than other hot springs.

1461
00:54:29,908 --> 00:54:31,341
Isn't that right?

1462
00:54:31,341 --> 00:54:33,141
This is a standing hot spring.

1463
00:54:33,141 --> 00:54:35,374
Sitting ones are over there.

1464
00:54:35,374 --> 00:54:37,408
- Should we go? / - Why you little...

1465
00:54:37,408 --> 00:54:40,541
Yun Haeyeong, please don't do that.

1466
00:54:40,541 --> 00:54:43,541
Yeah, I'm like that. But it's really not funny.

1467
00:54:45,474 --> 00:54:51,474
(There's another hot spring next to the standing one)

1468
00:54:56,874 --> 00:54:59,008
We're like fairies.

1469
00:54:59,008 --> 00:55:00,908
- You're right. Let's sit here. / - Fairies.

1470
00:55:03,941 --> 00:55:06,541
(Blurp)

1471
00:55:08,008 --> 00:55:09,208
What was that sound?

1472
00:55:09,208 --> 00:55:10,841
This sound isn't coming from my mouth.

1473
00:55:10,841 --> 00:55:12,241
It's the sound of the wind being split.

1474
00:55:13,641 --> 00:55:15,208
There is even a cave.

1475
00:55:15,208 --> 00:55:16,474
It's over there.

1476
00:55:16,474 --> 00:55:17,774
Haeyeong, go take a look.

1477
00:55:18,474 --> 00:55:19,874
Wait a minute.

1478
00:55:20,674 --> 00:55:21,674
What is that place?

1479
00:55:23,008 --> 00:55:25,274
- Oh, my. / - How is it?

1480
00:55:27,108 --> 00:55:29,541
(She discovers the cave)

1481
00:55:30,041 --> 00:55:32,174
- Is it a cave? / - Yes, it is a cave.

1482
00:55:32,174 --> 00:55:34,874
People must have secret affairs here.

1483
00:55:34,874 --> 00:55:37,041
Haeyeong, come back alive.

1484
00:55:37,041 --> 00:55:38,774
Okay, don't worry.

1485
00:55:38,774 --> 00:55:40,108
Look at this cave.

1486
00:55:42,174 --> 00:55:44,108
(Ahhh)

1487
00:55:44,608 --> 00:55:46,374
(Ahhh)

1488
00:55:47,941 --> 00:55:49,974
(Huh?)

1489
00:55:50,141 --> 00:55:51,608
(Green mountain)

1490
00:55:52,374 --> 00:55:54,408
(What's she doing now?)

1491
00:55:55,408 --> 00:55:58,874
(She ends her cave exploration after a song)

1492
00:55:59,974 --> 00:56:02,641
Hot springs are the best while sitting.

1493
00:56:03,641 --> 00:56:06,274
It's more stable than standing.

1494
00:56:06,274 --> 00:56:08,241
The first hot spring is

1495
00:56:08,241 --> 00:56:10,808
good for sore muscles and problematic body parts.

1496
00:56:10,808 --> 00:56:12,774
This place is good for the skin.

1497
00:56:12,774 --> 00:56:16,474
The water is really good for your skin aesthetically.

1498
00:56:17,808 --> 00:56:18,941
This is nice.

1499
00:56:21,174 --> 00:56:24,241
The color of the water is kind of black.

1500
00:56:24,241 --> 00:56:26,774
It's also murky.

1501
00:56:27,208 --> 00:56:28,441
True.

1502
00:56:28,441 --> 00:56:29,841
It's unique that it's murky.

1503
00:56:29,841 --> 00:56:34,141
You can see the out through the bamboo trees.

1504
00:56:34,141 --> 00:56:35,908
It's an open-air bath.

1505
00:56:35,908 --> 00:56:39,041
- This will be best in the winter. / - That's right.

1506
00:56:39,508 --> 00:56:42,674
This is our first hot spring, and it's so nice.

1507
00:56:42,674 --> 00:56:45,541
- I know. / - What will the others be like?

1508
00:56:45,541 --> 00:56:46,741
I'm really looking forward to it.

1509
00:56:46,741 --> 00:56:48,774
- It would be nice in the winter. / - It's so nice.

1510
00:56:48,774 --> 00:56:49,708
I know.

1511
00:56:49,708 --> 00:56:50,874
You know this?

1512
00:56:50,874 --> 00:56:53,574
We have to use up our medal.

1513
00:56:54,808 --> 00:56:56,508
Should we go?

1514
00:56:56,508 --> 00:56:58,308
Let's move to the next location.

1515
00:56:58,308 --> 00:56:59,908
- We sweat out a lot already. / - Yeah.

1516
00:56:59,908 --> 00:57:00,974
Let's go.

1517
00:57:02,674 --> 00:57:04,041
That's the good thing about Japanese hot springs.

1518
00:57:04,041 --> 00:57:06,541
- It's in harmony with nature. / - Right.

1519
00:57:06,541 --> 00:57:09,608
It tires you out less and makes you feel good.

1520
00:57:13,741 --> 00:57:17,341
The second one is famous for aesthetic purposes.

1521
00:57:17,908 --> 00:57:20,208
- I feel so good. / - Me too.

1522
00:57:20,208 --> 00:57:22,841
I'm so excited to see what the second one is like.

1523
00:57:23,408 --> 00:57:24,641
This is so nice.

1524
00:57:27,241 --> 00:57:29,008
I feel refreshed.

1525
00:57:29,774 --> 00:57:32,741
What if our skins peel from all these hot springs.

1526
00:57:33,974 --> 00:57:35,408
You'll have beautiful skin.

1527
00:57:35,408 --> 00:57:37,341
- The last one. / - This is the third one.

1528
00:57:37,341 --> 00:57:39,774
- With a history of 150 years. / - This is nice.

1529
00:57:39,774 --> 00:57:42,208
This is a bamboo forest hot spring.

1530
00:57:42,208 --> 00:57:43,408
That place is really nice.

1531
00:57:44,708 --> 00:57:47,574
- Jungah. / - I feel refreshed.

1532
00:57:47,574 --> 00:57:49,541
- I feel refreshed again. / - It's tiring, right?

1533
00:57:49,541 --> 00:57:51,341
We have to show our medals.

1534
00:57:51,341 --> 00:57:54,674
Yes, we accomplished three hot springs.

1535
00:57:54,674 --> 00:57:57,174
- Ta-da. / - Ta-da.

1536
00:57:57,174 --> 00:57:59,041
See the stamps?

1537
00:57:59,441 --> 00:58:01,708
- Do they hang them there? / - Yes.

1538
00:58:01,708 --> 00:58:04,574
People all hung them there.

1539
00:58:05,108 --> 00:58:07,441
We have to clearly show that we

1540
00:58:07,441 --> 00:58:10,041
accomplished our mission.

1541
00:58:10,041 --> 00:58:11,708
There you go.

1542
00:58:12,574 --> 00:58:14,974
- Let's hang them next to each other. / - Okay.

1543
00:58:14,974 --> 00:58:16,974
Let's hang them together.

1544
00:58:17,641 --> 00:58:19,974
- When we visit Japan next time... / - Yeah.

1545
00:58:19,974 --> 00:58:21,674
We'll come back to this hot spring.

1546
00:58:22,408 --> 00:58:23,641
Good-bye.

1547
00:58:24,674 --> 00:58:25,874
Farewell.

1548
00:58:26,741 --> 00:58:27,441
Hot spring village.

1549
00:58:27,441 --> 00:58:29,774
I think I'd book my hotel in that hot spring village

1550
00:58:29,774 --> 00:58:31,774
and just keep visiting hot springs.

1551
00:58:32,874 --> 00:58:38,708
(Kurokawa Hot Spring Village to Hakata Station)

1552
00:58:38,708 --> 00:58:43,341
(Fukuoka downtown, 4:40 p.m.)

1553
00:58:44,641 --> 00:58:46,708
- I'm hungry. / - You're hungry again?

1554
00:58:46,708 --> 00:58:48,474
I spent too much time in the hot spring.

1555
00:58:48,474 --> 00:58:50,808
- From Kurokawa... / - I'm totally exhausted.

1556
00:58:50,808 --> 00:58:53,741
- To here took too long. / - It was too long, right?

1557
00:58:53,741 --> 00:58:57,241
Since it's dinner...

1558
00:58:57,241 --> 00:59:00,008
- Let's eat something expensive. / - Grand meal?

1559
00:59:00,008 --> 00:59:00,941
Shall we?

1560
00:59:00,941 --> 00:59:03,308
- Please do everything I ask for. / - Okay.

1561
00:59:03,308 --> 00:59:06,341
I want to drink beer while bathing in the hot spring.

1562
00:59:06,341 --> 00:59:07,808
- And udon. / - Udon.

1563
00:59:07,808 --> 00:59:09,074
This is udon.

1564
00:59:09,074 --> 00:59:10,408
- Yakiniku. / - Yakiniku.

1565
00:59:10,408 --> 00:59:12,908
- It looks so delicious. / - Yakiniku.

1566
00:59:12,908 --> 00:59:15,308
- Yakiniku. / - Yes.

1567
00:59:15,308 --> 00:59:17,641
- Japanese yakiniku. / - Yakiniku is really good.

1568
00:59:17,641 --> 00:59:20,308
- Yakiniku. / - Yakiniku.

1569
00:59:20,308 --> 00:59:22,541
- I want to eat yakiniku. / - It's good, right?

1570
00:59:22,541 --> 00:59:24,908
- Let's go, let's go. / - Yes.

1571
00:59:24,908 --> 00:59:26,741
- It'll be so delicious. / - It'll be delicious.

1572
00:59:26,741 --> 00:59:28,241
- This must be it. / - Is this it?

1573
00:59:28,241 --> 00:59:30,041
- It looks clean. / - Yeah.

1574
00:59:31,408 --> 00:59:32,674
I love it.

1575
00:59:33,341 --> 00:59:34,641
It'll be so good.

1576
00:59:39,674 --> 00:59:41,508
- Jungah. / - We're finally here.

1577
00:59:41,508 --> 00:59:42,974
I know.

1578
00:59:42,974 --> 00:59:44,108
- Let's order. / - Looks good.

1579
00:59:44,108 --> 00:59:45,274
Order.

1580
00:59:46,208 --> 00:59:49,841
Welcome... Wait, that's not right.

1581
00:59:51,141 --> 00:59:53,174
- It's really crowded here. / - It is.

1582
00:59:53,174 --> 00:59:54,908
- It's starting to get crowded. / - It's about time.

1583
00:59:54,908 --> 00:59:57,574
Since it's dinner time...

1584
00:59:57,574 --> 01:00:00,874
- They're crowding. / - We overdid it at the hot springs.

1585
01:00:00,874 --> 01:00:01,841
- Yeah, we did. / - Aren't you hungry?

1586
01:00:01,841 --> 01:00:03,741
Visiting three places is not easy.

1587
01:00:03,741 --> 01:00:04,608
Aren't you hungry?

1588
01:00:04,608 --> 01:00:07,574
I think I'll really enjoy it once the food comes out.

1589
01:00:08,908 --> 01:00:11,274
Ginger?

1590
01:00:12,374 --> 01:00:15,374
We seem to get to drink highball a lot.

1591
01:00:15,374 --> 01:00:17,074
- Cheers. / - Cheers.

1592
01:00:19,708 --> 01:00:20,974
(Gulp)

1593
01:00:23,374 --> 01:00:25,908
Mine tastes like juice.

1594
01:00:27,741 --> 01:00:30,174
Excuse me. Could you mix some soju in this?

1595
01:00:30,174 --> 01:00:32,274
- This need soju. / - Try some.

1596
01:00:32,274 --> 01:00:34,341
- It's just juice. / - Will this do?

1597
01:00:34,341 --> 01:00:37,308
- It's just a soda. / - You're right.

1598
01:00:37,308 --> 01:00:38,908
- Is it different to mine? / - It's the same.

1599
01:00:38,908 --> 01:00:42,141
There's not much whiskey in it.

1600
01:00:42,141 --> 01:00:43,974
You're right. It's a bit...

1601
01:00:43,974 --> 01:00:46,108
- It's tasty though. / - It's tasty but...

1602
01:00:46,941 --> 01:00:48,574
It's weak for us.

1603
01:00:50,974 --> 01:00:53,141
- This is beef tongue. / - It's beef tongue.

1604
01:00:55,708 --> 01:00:59,674
(Grill and meat are the best combination)

1605
01:01:00,141 --> 01:01:01,408
It was really good.

1606
01:01:01,408 --> 01:01:04,841
Hyunjoo's been won over.

1607
01:01:05,541 --> 01:01:09,041
(A table of yakiniku will fill their empty stomachs)

1608
01:01:09,041 --> 01:01:12,308
(The special cut is beef tongue)

1609
01:01:12,308 --> 01:01:13,874
It was really delicious.

1610
01:01:15,674 --> 01:01:17,874
The color is amazing.

1611
01:01:17,874 --> 01:01:19,941
- Let's grill it. / - Right away.

1612
01:01:19,941 --> 01:01:21,474
Jungah, you should try a piece.

1613
01:01:21,474 --> 01:01:23,141
- Shall I? / - Yes.

1614
01:01:23,141 --> 01:01:24,341
Take a piece of meat.

1615
01:01:27,541 --> 01:01:29,541
I didn't know you eat this.

1616
01:01:29,541 --> 01:01:31,241
I don't think I've ever had tongue before.

1617
01:01:31,241 --> 01:01:32,441
- Same for me. / - Even in Korea.

1618
01:01:32,441 --> 01:01:33,574
- Have you had it before? / - I don't think so.

1619
01:01:33,574 --> 01:01:35,874
- This is a cow's tongue. / -  I know.

1620
01:01:35,874 --> 01:01:36,708
Then...

1621
01:01:41,674 --> 01:01:43,008
Is this how big a cow's tongue is?

1622
01:01:43,008 --> 01:01:44,941
Goodness, Jungah. Don't say it.

1623
01:01:44,941 --> 01:01:46,774
Just eat it.

1624
01:01:46,774 --> 01:01:48,741
- The tongue... / - What's wrong with you?

1625
01:01:48,741 --> 01:01:50,774
Doesn't this mean its tongue is this big?

1626
01:01:56,808 --> 01:01:57,608
It's burning.

1627
01:02:00,808 --> 01:02:02,574
It sucks in all the smoke.

1628
01:02:02,574 --> 01:02:04,341
It looks delicious.

1629
01:02:04,341 --> 01:02:06,141
It looks delicious.

1630
01:02:06,141 --> 01:02:07,408
- Looks so delicious! / - Gosh.

1631
01:02:08,641 --> 01:02:11,608
- Shall we begin? / - Try it. See if it's good.

1632
01:02:12,574 --> 01:02:15,908
- Haeyeong, with this... / - Squeeze the lemon?

1633
01:02:15,908 --> 01:02:17,374
Squeeze it here.

1634
01:02:17,374 --> 01:02:19,308
You dip the tongue in the lemon.

1635
01:02:19,808 --> 01:02:22,508
This is sauce for the meat and this is for the tongue.

1636
01:02:24,574 --> 01:02:27,741
- That looks so good. / - Looks so good.

1637
01:02:28,874 --> 01:02:32,408
(How does their first tongue meat taste?)

1638
01:02:34,674 --> 01:02:36,608
That's a genuine expression.

1639
01:02:37,074 --> 01:02:38,041
It's tongue meat.

1640
01:02:38,041 --> 01:02:39,108
Does it melt in your mouth?

1641
01:02:41,908 --> 01:02:42,541
It looks tasty.

1642
01:02:42,541 --> 01:02:44,641
Just watching you eating it makes me...

1643
01:02:44,641 --> 01:02:46,641
I've never experienced it before.

1644
01:02:46,641 --> 01:02:47,941
- Really? / - I've never tasted such flavor before.

1645
01:02:47,941 --> 01:02:49,508
- Try it. / - Is it a new world?

1646
01:02:49,508 --> 01:02:50,741
It kind of...

1647
01:02:51,908 --> 01:02:53,741
Tastes of liver.

1648
01:02:53,741 --> 01:02:56,708
- It tastes similar to beef heart. / - Beef heart.

1649
01:02:56,708 --> 01:02:59,708
Right? It's good.

1650
01:03:00,908 --> 01:03:02,608
- My saliva's just... / - It's good.

1651
01:03:02,608 --> 01:03:05,208
- It's not gamey at all. / - Not at all.

1652
01:03:06,408 --> 01:03:09,641
It tastes much better in the lemon juice.

1653
01:03:09,641 --> 01:03:10,941
It's really tasty.

1654
01:03:10,941 --> 01:03:12,641
- Let's grill the next one. / - Grill one of these?

1655
01:03:13,341 --> 01:03:16,741
This is beef loin.

1656
01:03:16,741 --> 01:03:21,774
And this meat is lightly marinated, right?

1657
01:03:21,774 --> 01:03:24,441
Like with soy sauce.

1658
01:03:24,441 --> 01:03:26,041
- It's nice and sweet. / - I know.

1659
01:03:26,041 --> 01:03:29,274
I like that we can cook our own meat.

1660
01:03:29,274 --> 01:03:29,974
Right?

1661
01:03:29,974 --> 01:03:32,641
If someone takes a piece of meat that I cooked,

1662
01:03:32,641 --> 01:03:34,974
it upsets you.

1663
01:03:34,974 --> 01:03:36,108
I know.

1664
01:03:36,108 --> 01:03:38,208
What if someone takes my meat?

1665
01:03:38,208 --> 01:03:40,274
- Exactly. It'll cause fighting. / - It's annoying.

1666
01:03:41,541 --> 01:03:42,641
I'm going to eat mine.

1667
01:03:42,641 --> 01:03:43,741
It smells delicious.

1668
01:03:47,708 --> 01:03:49,841
Jungah, you look like you're truly enjoying it.

1669
01:03:53,141 --> 01:03:55,408
- It's not salty at all. / - Is it good?

1670
01:03:55,808 --> 01:03:57,008
Let me try it.

1671
01:04:00,708 --> 01:04:02,408
- It's good, isn't it? / - Yes.

1672
01:04:02,408 --> 01:04:04,341
- It just melts, right? / - It melts.

1673
01:04:04,974 --> 01:04:07,441
The meat is really tender.

1674
01:04:07,441 --> 01:04:08,674
- It's good, right? / - Yeah.

1675
01:04:09,174 --> 01:04:10,508
- This is... / - The ribs?

1676
01:04:10,508 --> 01:04:11,741
- Yes. / - I see.

1677
01:04:11,741 --> 01:04:13,974
Boneless rib meat.

1678
01:04:13,974 --> 01:04:16,908
They cut the meat thick here.

1679
01:04:16,908 --> 01:04:19,408
So the meat is really juicy.

1680
01:04:19,408 --> 01:04:22,608
It holds in the beef juices. That's why it's good.

1681
01:04:24,141 --> 01:04:26,374
- This time, Haeyeong. / - Yes?

1682
01:04:26,374 --> 01:04:29,541
I'll try it with wasabi.

1683
01:04:30,108 --> 01:04:30,774
That's so...

1684
01:04:33,174 --> 01:04:34,474
How is it? Good?

1685
01:04:35,074 --> 01:04:38,108
(This is the third time she's been moved by the meat)

1686
01:04:41,408 --> 01:04:43,074
It just melts.

1687
01:04:43,074 --> 01:04:44,441
Wow, the burn from the wasabi...

1688
01:04:46,508 --> 01:04:49,174
(Burning sensation)

1689
01:04:49,174 --> 01:04:51,008
I was thinking you put too much wasabi on it.

1690
01:04:51,008 --> 01:04:53,641
- You're so... / - I'm crying because it's so good.

1691
01:04:53,641 --> 01:04:55,341
What's with you, Haeyeong?

1692
01:04:55,341 --> 01:04:56,674
It was still good.

1693
01:04:57,374 --> 01:04:58,974
I knew you put too much.

1694
01:05:03,208 --> 01:05:04,641
Oh, this...

1695
01:05:05,441 --> 01:05:07,141
This is Japanese cold noodles.

1696
01:05:07,141 --> 01:05:10,008
- I've never had this before. / - Me neither.

1697
01:05:10,008 --> 01:05:13,041
Why does Japanese noodles have kimchi?

1698
01:05:13,041 --> 01:05:15,808
You're right. The noodles are unique.

1699
01:05:15,808 --> 01:05:19,841
Japanese cold noodles are eaten with kimchi on top.

1700
01:05:26,208 --> 01:05:28,308
How do the noodle taste?

1701
01:05:29,841 --> 01:05:33,008
- Is it good? / - It's like radish water kimchi.

1702
01:05:33,008 --> 01:05:35,308
Really? They look like chewy noodles.

1703
01:05:35,308 --> 01:05:38,241
- You need to eat it with the eat. / - Looks so good.

1704
01:05:41,541 --> 01:05:42,708
- Is it good? / - Yes.

1705
01:05:43,841 --> 01:05:46,574
Japanese cold noodles taste good too.

1706
01:05:47,674 --> 01:05:50,541
- It tastes so good together. / - Really?

1707
01:05:50,541 --> 01:05:53,774
- Meat and cold noodles go well together. / - Exactly.

1708
01:05:55,508 --> 01:05:57,374
You be the meat, I'll be the noodles.

1709
01:05:57,374 --> 01:05:58,641
Since we go well together.

1710
01:05:59,908 --> 01:06:01,574
Yeah, do whatever you want.

1711
01:06:02,508 --> 01:06:04,041
Shall we eat another piece of meat?

1712
01:06:04,041 --> 01:06:06,074
Yes. I'll eat cold noodles.

1713
01:06:06,441 --> 01:06:08,774
- After we eat this... / - Yes?

1714
01:06:08,774 --> 01:06:10,908
We should go for a last drink.

1715
01:06:12,274 --> 01:06:13,408
As our second stop?

1716
01:06:13,408 --> 01:06:15,841
It's too much of a waste to not enjoy the night.

1717
01:06:15,841 --> 01:06:21,741
(15 minutes to Nagahama food cart)

1718
01:06:22,541 --> 01:06:26,374
(The darkness falls and it starts to drizzle)

1719
01:06:26,374 --> 01:06:28,641
The food cart.

1720
01:06:28,641 --> 01:06:30,674
You're right. It's called "yatai" in Japanese.

1721
01:06:30,674 --> 01:06:33,574
(The night makes them crave fish cake broth)

1722
01:06:33,574 --> 01:06:35,341
But food cart is expensive.

1723
01:06:35,341 --> 01:06:36,841
Since it's tourist-oriented.

1724
01:06:36,841 --> 01:06:38,608
- But our one wasn't. / - If you find the right place...

1725
01:06:38,608 --> 01:06:40,141
- We found a cheaper one. / - Good, good.

1726
01:06:40,141 --> 01:06:42,708
- It's not one of those places. / - Very good.

1727
01:06:42,708 --> 01:06:45,241
This must be where we have our finale.

1728
01:06:45,241 --> 01:06:46,608
I know.

1729
01:06:46,608 --> 01:06:49,341
This place is... Food carts are called...

1730
01:06:49,341 --> 01:06:51,608
- "Yatai" in Japanese. / - Yatai?

1731
01:06:51,608 --> 01:06:53,941
Yatai.

1732
01:06:55,308 --> 01:07:00,674
A lot of Koreans and tourists

1733
01:07:00,674 --> 01:07:04,441
go to Nakasu for food carts.

1734
01:07:04,441 --> 01:07:07,408
- But we're going to Nagahama. / - Nagahama.

1735
01:07:07,408 --> 01:07:10,141
It's like, let's grab a drink.

1736
01:07:10,141 --> 01:07:11,474
- Drink up? / - Yeah.

1737
01:07:11,474 --> 01:07:14,708
How old are they that they keep making dad jokes?

1738
01:07:14,708 --> 01:07:17,841
- They are at the age of old men. / - Yes.

1739
01:07:18,308 --> 01:07:22,174
Nagahama is a food cart village.

1740
01:07:22,174 --> 01:07:25,108
This is the original.

1741
01:07:25,108 --> 01:07:26,641
This is the original place.

1742
01:07:26,641 --> 01:07:28,908
Hey, this place is empty. Let's go here.

1743
01:07:28,908 --> 01:07:31,341
Yes, it's empty because we booked it for the show.

1744
01:07:31,341 --> 01:07:33,474
- Come on in. / - Let's go in.

1745
01:07:34,741 --> 01:07:37,441
- Welcome. / - Hello.

1746
01:07:38,574 --> 01:07:39,741
Hello.

1747
01:07:39,741 --> 01:07:41,574
Sikyung, you go there often, don't you?

1748
01:07:41,574 --> 01:07:43,074
I'd love to.

1749
01:07:43,074 --> 01:07:45,874
- It was really nice. / - There are lots of foreigners.

1750
01:07:45,874 --> 01:07:47,474
- Haeyeong. / - I know.

1751
01:07:47,474 --> 01:07:50,608
It's supposed to be famous only among the locals.

1752
01:07:50,608 --> 01:07:52,708
Thank you.

1753
01:07:53,341 --> 01:07:54,874
That draft beer looks so good.

1754
01:07:56,208 --> 01:07:58,808
The locals bring them here.

1755
01:07:58,808 --> 01:08:02,474
You're right. It's even unknown among locals.

1756
01:08:02,474 --> 01:08:05,508
Exactly. This is our secret course.

1757
01:08:05,508 --> 01:08:09,041
By the way, we haven't eaten any ramen in Japan.

1758
01:08:09,041 --> 01:08:11,741
- We had no time to have ramen. / - You should eat it.

1759
01:08:11,741 --> 01:08:13,074
- They sell ramen there? / - Yes.

1760
01:08:13,074 --> 01:08:15,374
It's called hakata ramen.

1761
01:08:15,374 --> 01:08:17,174
- It's made with pork broth, right? / - Yes.

1762
01:08:17,174 --> 01:08:18,141
It's tonkotsu ramen.

1763
01:08:18,141 --> 01:08:21,041
I heard this place is where

1764
01:08:21,041 --> 01:08:22,941
the tonkotsu ramen was invented.

1765
01:08:22,941 --> 01:08:24,308
Not only this food cart

1766
01:08:24,308 --> 01:08:26,741
but also all those shops there

1767
01:08:26,741 --> 01:08:28,508
all sell tonkotsu ramen.

1768
01:08:28,508 --> 01:08:30,308
Let's order ramen

1769
01:08:30,308 --> 01:08:31,641
since it's famous.

1770
01:08:31,641 --> 01:08:35,208
We're in Japan. We should try ramen.

1771
01:08:35,941 --> 01:08:37,908
- It's made with pork broth, right? / - Yes.

1772
01:08:37,908 --> 01:08:39,074
It's tonkotsu ramen.

1773
01:08:40,508 --> 01:08:44,108
(When the noodles are cooked)

1774
01:08:44,108 --> 01:08:49,674
(They drain and put into the broth)

1775
01:08:49,674 --> 01:08:51,008
(Lastly, meat and spring onions are added on top)

1776
01:08:51,708 --> 01:08:53,008
(Goodness)

1777
01:08:56,608 --> 01:08:57,641
It's ready.

1778
01:08:58,274 --> 01:09:00,041
This must be minced garlic.

1779
01:09:00,041 --> 01:09:02,608
I heard it tastes much better with it.

1780
01:09:02,608 --> 01:09:04,641
I'm sure it helps with the gamey taste.

1781
01:09:05,408 --> 01:09:06,808
Should I add the spice?

1782
01:09:07,874 --> 01:09:09,241
Add some.

1783
01:09:10,008 --> 01:09:11,474
That's enough.

1784
01:09:11,474 --> 01:09:12,941
It's not enough. This is nothing.

1785
01:09:12,941 --> 01:09:15,474
If Jungah and Jungsoo travel together,

1786
01:09:15,474 --> 01:09:16,341
it'll be exhausting.

1787
01:09:16,341 --> 01:09:18,408
- Why? / - There will be a lot of conflicts.

1788
01:09:18,408 --> 01:09:19,674
I think you two should go on a trip together.

1789
01:09:19,674 --> 01:09:22,608
- I like it spicy. / - We'll have a fight.

1790
01:09:22,608 --> 01:09:24,041
Let me try.

1791
01:09:28,841 --> 01:09:30,841
It tastes much richer now.

1792
01:09:30,841 --> 01:09:32,174
- It's delicious. / - Yeah.

1793
01:09:32,174 --> 01:09:33,541
It's delicious.

1794
01:09:33,541 --> 01:09:35,874
It tastes like thick beef bone broth.

1795
01:09:35,874 --> 01:09:37,008
It's savory, isn't it?

1796
01:09:37,774 --> 01:09:38,674
It does.

1797
01:09:39,474 --> 01:09:42,141
We just had dinner but this

1798
01:09:42,141 --> 01:09:43,774
late night food is so tasty.

1799
01:09:43,774 --> 01:09:47,641
This is the most food I've eaten recently.

1800
01:09:48,308 --> 01:09:50,774
- You're eating this after having yakiniku? / - Yes.

1801
01:09:52,474 --> 01:09:54,241
We're spending our last night in Fukuoka...

1802
01:09:54,241 --> 01:09:57,441
- At a food cart. / - I never imagined this.

1803
01:09:58,908 --> 01:10:01,408
Jungah, how did you like our trip?

1804
01:10:01,408 --> 01:10:02,674
Did you have fun?

1805
01:10:02,674 --> 01:10:06,308
For me... Honestly...

1806
01:10:07,608 --> 01:10:09,374
When I imagined our trip to Japan...

1807
01:10:10,508 --> 01:10:14,274
I just thought we'd go to hot springs...

1808
01:10:15,141 --> 01:10:17,608
And eat delicious foods. I thought it'd be a normal trip.

1809
01:10:18,708 --> 01:10:20,308
I really loved the Kurokawa.

1810
01:10:20,308 --> 01:10:22,274
I think it's a perfect place to go

1811
01:10:22,274 --> 01:10:24,074
with your friends or mother.

1812
01:10:24,074 --> 01:10:26,408
- Kurokawa was beautiful. / - Right.

1813
01:10:26,408 --> 01:10:28,508
The scenery was so nice.

1814
01:10:28,508 --> 01:10:32,008
And going to each of the hot springs...

1815
01:10:32,008 --> 01:10:34,908
- Experiencing hot springs. / - A real hot spring.

1816
01:10:35,508 --> 01:10:38,574
And also eating custard bread on the street.

1817
01:10:38,574 --> 01:10:40,241
That was so fun.

1818
01:10:40,241 --> 01:10:42,941
Even after I go back to Korea, I won't forget this trip.

1819
01:10:42,941 --> 01:10:44,041
Me too.

1820
01:10:44,041 --> 01:10:46,374
Whenever I go to a sauna, I'll think of Kurokawa.

1821
01:10:48,208 --> 01:10:49,608
It was so nice.

1822
01:10:49,608 --> 01:10:52,241
What was the most impressive thing during this trip?

1823
01:10:53,208 --> 01:10:54,341
For me...

1824
01:10:58,041 --> 01:11:00,208
I just liked how I escaped my daily life...

1825
01:11:00,974 --> 01:11:03,041
With a great friend,

1826
01:11:03,041 --> 01:11:06,308
and staying at nice places.

1827
01:11:06,308 --> 01:11:10,008
I wondered if I had been to Fukuoka before.

1828
01:11:10,008 --> 01:11:13,874
It's like I felt the true charm of Fukuoka

1829
01:11:13,874 --> 01:11:15,808
through this trip.

1830
01:11:15,808 --> 01:11:19,274
We did a proper tour of Fukuoka on this trip.

1831
01:11:20,274 --> 01:11:23,974
(The last night of the trip makes her tear up)

1832
01:11:24,541 --> 01:11:25,374
Are you crying?

1833
01:11:25,808 --> 01:11:27,141
Sometimes you just tear up.

1834
01:11:27,141 --> 01:11:29,008
- I can understand her. / - Why did you cry?

1835
01:11:29,008 --> 01:11:31,141
It was just so nice.

1836
01:11:31,141 --> 01:11:32,941
- Sometimes you cry tears of joy. / - I got teary too.

1837
01:11:32,941 --> 01:11:34,541
- Did you? / - Yes.

1838
01:11:36,474 --> 01:11:37,408
It's so...

1839
01:11:39,174 --> 01:11:40,308
Are you crying?

1840
01:11:42,608 --> 01:11:44,208
I told you not to cry.

1841
01:11:44,208 --> 01:11:46,008
- It's just so nice. / - It is, right?

1842
01:11:47,241 --> 01:11:49,641
- I'm crying because of the smoke. / - Let's toast.

1843
01:11:49,641 --> 01:11:51,141
I can understand that. Being in a nice place...

1844
01:11:51,141 --> 01:11:52,974
- With a nice person... / - That's right.

1845
01:11:52,974 --> 01:11:55,308
- You can cry. / - You can cry over beer.

1846
01:11:55,308 --> 01:11:57,541
- Haeyeong, thank you. / - I thank you.

1847
01:11:58,708 --> 01:11:59,741
Love shot.

1848
01:11:59,741 --> 01:12:03,608
(It was a great trip no matter what)

1849
01:12:04,708 --> 01:12:06,141
So good.

1850
01:12:06,141 --> 01:12:07,141
It's delicious.

1851
01:12:07,141 --> 01:12:10,274
- That mood. / - It was so nice.

1852
01:12:10,541 --> 01:12:13,441
(Their hot Fukuoka trip is over)

1853
01:12:13,441 --> 01:12:15,574
Very nice.

1854
01:12:17,974 --> 01:12:20,208
To be honest,

1855
01:12:20,208 --> 01:12:23,141
both of your trips to hot springs

1856
01:12:23,141 --> 01:12:24,808
we so great.

1857
01:12:24,808 --> 01:12:25,874
- They were so good. / - So good.

1858
01:12:25,874 --> 01:12:26,841
There's nothing bad to say.

1859
01:12:26,841 --> 01:12:29,841
- That's exactly I wanted to say. / - They're similar.

1860
01:12:29,841 --> 01:12:33,608
They're both good and both a little different.

1861
01:12:33,608 --> 01:12:38,874
- Nha Trang is great for energetic kids. / - The vibe.

1862
01:12:38,874 --> 01:12:42,074
Like in grade school. It's great for family.

1863
01:12:42,074 --> 01:12:44,108
It's great to go with elementary school kids.

1864
01:12:44,108 --> 01:12:47,141
And their one was good with friends, lovers.

1865
01:12:47,141 --> 01:12:48,941
Good to go with them.

1866
01:12:48,941 --> 01:12:51,341
- It was more for adults. / - That's right.

1867
01:12:51,341 --> 01:12:52,641
- Also... / - For trendy adults.

1868
01:12:52,641 --> 01:12:55,841
Above all, it just felt like a short trip

1869
01:12:55,841 --> 01:12:58,174
to Haeundae or Jeju-do.

1870
01:12:58,174 --> 01:13:00,741
- But it felt like so much more. / - It's not tiring.

1871
01:13:00,741 --> 01:13:04,174
- We spent so much time at hot springs. / - Thank you.

1872
01:13:04,174 --> 01:13:06,974
Our teams have traded places.

1873
01:13:06,974 --> 01:13:09,441
Jungah was won over by Nha Trang last week.

1874
01:13:10,074 --> 01:13:11,074
That's right.

1875
01:13:11,074 --> 01:13:13,108
And Hyunjoo was won over by Fukuoka.

1876
01:13:13,108 --> 01:13:15,208
I was so jealous.

1877
01:13:15,208 --> 01:13:17,074
They're so jealous of each other's trips.

1878
01:13:17,074 --> 01:13:19,241
You've fallen for Fukuoka, right?

1879
01:13:19,241 --> 01:13:20,941
Yes, I really have.

1880
01:13:20,941 --> 01:13:23,774
Next time, Guide Yun and Guide Kong go together.

1881
01:13:23,774 --> 01:13:26,274
- Swap teams. / - No, no.

1882
01:13:26,274 --> 01:13:28,741
Jungsoo and Jungah will clash.

1883
01:13:28,741 --> 01:13:30,408
- Clash? / - You clash.

1884
01:13:30,408 --> 01:13:32,174
- They're the same. / - When fire meets fire...

1885
01:13:32,174 --> 01:13:33,241
You get trouble.

1886
01:13:33,241 --> 01:13:34,841
- That's what I want to see. / - No, no.

1887
01:13:34,841 --> 01:13:36,274
You won't get any footage for TV.

1888
01:13:36,274 --> 01:13:38,308
- We might end up fighting. / - We'll burn up.

1889
01:13:38,641 --> 01:13:41,341
- We'll burn up. / - They're actually soft-hearted.

1890
01:13:41,341 --> 01:13:44,408
We have to find out how much the Fukuoka trip cost.

1891
01:13:44,408 --> 01:13:45,641
This is the most important.

1892
01:13:45,641 --> 01:13:47,441
Our Kong Tour was, per person...

1893
01:13:47,441 --> 01:13:49,608
- $225.90. / - $225.90.

1894
01:13:50,608 --> 01:13:52,608
- How much for Fukuoka? / - How much?

1895
01:13:52,608 --> 01:13:53,708
Jungah, how much was it?

1896
01:13:54,174 --> 01:13:56,208
$302.00

1897
01:13:57,041 --> 01:13:58,074
For 2 days?

1898
01:13:58,074 --> 01:13:59,308
- More than you think... / - It was just overnight.

1899
01:13:59,308 --> 01:14:02,941
- It was only overnight for us. / - Ours was 3 days.

1900
01:14:03,441 --> 01:14:05,541
Actually, we were worried

1901
01:14:05,541 --> 01:14:09,374
that their trip was too cheap.

1902
01:14:09,374 --> 01:14:12,041
But our trip... It's not that different.

1903
01:14:12,041 --> 01:14:14,874
- Plus cost of living is high in Japan. / - It is.

1904
01:14:14,874 --> 01:14:18,108
You must prepare the SUNQ pass.

1905
01:14:18,108 --> 01:14:19,208
- Yes. / - That's right.

1906
01:14:19,208 --> 01:14:20,241
The SUNQ pass is a must.

1907
01:14:20,241 --> 01:14:21,974
With it, you don't have to worry about

1908
01:14:21,974 --> 01:14:23,074
the transportation cost.

1909
01:14:23,074 --> 01:14:25,641
For our hot spring tour special, we went to

1910
01:14:25,641 --> 01:14:28,108
Nha Trang, Vietnam and Fukuoka, Japan.

1911
01:14:28,108 --> 01:14:30,441
- This week... / - Let's switch it up.

1912
01:14:30,441 --> 01:14:32,841
Should we do a national vote?

1913
01:14:32,841 --> 01:14:35,508
On the official Battle Trip social media page...

1914
01:14:35,508 --> 01:14:38,441
The trips to Nha Trang and Fukuoka will be posted.

1915
01:14:38,441 --> 01:14:40,041
The team that gets the most likes

1916
01:14:40,041 --> 01:14:41,774
will win.

1917
01:14:41,774 --> 01:14:43,774
- We'll only find out later then? / - That's right.

1918
01:14:43,774 --> 01:14:45,308
- Later. / - I'm curious.

1919
01:14:45,308 --> 01:14:47,208
Even after hearing this Jungsoo

1920
01:14:47,208 --> 01:14:48,874
knows she'll win.

1921
01:14:48,874 --> 01:14:50,608
- Of course we'll win. / - Just as it is.

1922
01:14:50,608 --> 01:14:52,241
Just from what you saw.

1923
01:14:52,241 --> 01:14:53,774
Just from what you felt.

1924
01:14:53,774 --> 01:14:55,108
Just vote that way.

1925
01:14:55,108 --> 01:14:58,808
Our trip was great to go on with a friend.

1926
01:14:58,808 --> 01:15:00,441
You can go there without any burden.

1927
01:15:00,441 --> 01:15:02,708
Fukuoka was a great place for that.

1928
01:15:02,708 --> 01:15:03,641
Thank you.

1929
01:15:03,641 --> 01:15:07,241
The two week long hot spring tour is now over.

1930
01:15:07,241 --> 01:15:08,074
Thank you for your hard work.

1931
01:15:08,074 --> 01:15:09,541
- Thank you. / - Thank you.

1932
01:15:09,541 --> 01:15:11,808
We'll be back next week

1933
01:15:11,808 --> 01:15:12,808
with better travel tips.

1934
01:15:12,808 --> 01:15:14,408
Thank you.

1935
01:15:17,708 --> 01:15:20,008
(Next week)

1936
01:15:22,074 --> 01:15:24,541
- First time in Australia, right? / - We're here.

1937
01:15:25,308 --> 01:15:26,508
(We've worked hard at Battle Trip to prepare this)

1938
01:15:26,508 --> 01:15:28,408
It feels refreshing.

1939
01:15:33,908 --> 01:15:35,574
Vietnamese local flavors.

1940
01:15:35,574 --> 01:15:40,608
(Travel is all about food trends)

1941
01:15:41,741 --> 01:15:46,174
(Battle Trip)

1942
01:15:46,174 --> 01:16:02,808
("I Want Love" by Kassy)
