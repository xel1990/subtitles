It's our job to find hidden places.

It's random.

48
00:01:37,576 --> 00:01:38,910

- Is it sky-diving? / - Sky-diving?

73
00:02:23,476 --> 00:02:25,276
It's worse than sky-diving.

74
00:02:26,376 --> 00:02:27,610
- Space? / - What's worse than that?

75
00:02:27,610 --> 00:02:28,510

- Is this even possible? / - I don't know.

77
00:02:30,343 --> 00:02:32,143

(Flying a light aircraft)

79
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:36,810

Goodness.

81
00:02:40,576 --> 00:02:42,243

That's it.

84
00:02:45,210 --> 00:02:46,243
That color suits you.

85
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:51,810
(They all have different reactions)

86
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:55,110

87
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:56,076
- It's not bad. / - What do I do?

88
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:57,443

91

(Sikyung picked Flyboarding)

93
00:03:08,510 --> 00:03:09,543
This is the best.

94
00:03:09,543 --> 00:03:10,743
Why?

95
00:03:10,743 --> 00:03:13,310
People actually think about doing this?

96
00:03:14,210 --> 00:03:17,410
(Let's see now)

97
00:03:17,876 --> 00:03:18,876

99

Okay, go.

100
00:03:22,043 --> 00:03:23,543
No! Don't! Don't!

101
00:03:23,543 --> 00:03:26,310
(That's when I planned on revenge)

102
00:03:26,843 --> 00:03:29,510
(I need to give this to Sikyung)

103
00:03:30,076 --> 00:03:31,210
Swap with me.

104
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:31,743
Why?

105
00:03:31,743 --> 00:03:32,643
I have two of the same thing.

106
00:03:32,643 --> 00:03:33,610
What is it?

107
00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:34,376
It's eating.

108
00:03:36,443 --> 00:03:37,310
Are you sure that it's eating?

109
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:38,643
Yes, both of them are.

110
00:03:38,643 --> 00:03:39,976
I can't give this up,

111
00:03:39,976 --> 00:03:41,143
because it's cool.

112
00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:44,210
But this is a different kind of cool.

113
00:03:45,243 --> 00:03:46,243
Give that to me.

114
00:03:46,243 --> 00:03:47,376
- What? / - Give that to me.

115
00:03:48,176 --> 00:03:49,143
Both of mine are eating.

116
00:03:50,243 --> 00:03:52,143
(Sikyung, swap with me)

117
00:03:52,143 --> 00:03:53,310
Give me one eating one then.

118
00:03:54,976 --> 00:03:56,076
Wait a minute.

119
00:03:56,076 --> 00:03:56,743
This is good.

120
00:03:56,743 --> 00:03:58,476
You shouldn't look.

121
00:03:58,476 --> 00:03:59,943
I haven't swapped mine yet.

122
00:03:59,943 --> 00:04:01,343
What is it?

123
00:04:01,343 --> 00:04:02,810
- Is it food relate? / - Something scary in the air.

124
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:03,876
What about this?

125
00:04:03,876 --> 00:04:05,943
This is something to enjoy.

126
00:04:05,943 --> 00:04:08,310
I'm scared about being in the air.

127
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:09,910
- You don't mind it, right? / - I like it.

128
00:04:10,643 --> 00:04:12,043
Since I'm on a diet,

129
00:04:12,043 --> 00:04:13,176
I'll go flying for you.

130
00:04:13,176 --> 00:04:14,810
- Since you can't. / - Okay, you do this one.

131
00:04:14,810 --> 00:04:15,976
This is really delicious.

132
00:04:18,876 --> 00:04:19,776
Done.

133
00:04:22,543 --> 00:04:23,343

00:06:06,810 --> 00:06:08,610
You really liked riding light aircrafts.

188
00:06:08,610 --> 00:06:10,810
You can fly them yourself in Guam.

189
00:06:10,810 --> 00:06:12,576
Try it and l let us know

190
00:06:12,576 --> 00:06:14,443
how Guam looks from the sky.

191
00:06:15,410 --> 00:06:16,910
I had this and

192
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:18,276
the self-wedding photo shoot in my hand.

193
00:06:18,843 --> 00:06:20,710
I told him this was an activity in the air

194
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:22,010
and I gave him the wrong one.

195
00:06:22,476 --> 00:06:23,543
I gave him the wrong one.

196
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:26,876
I was supposed to give him this.

197
00:06:26,876 --> 00:06:28,676
I gave Sikyung the self-wedding photo shoot.

198
00:06:29,776 --> 00:06:31,243
So that's why Sikyung chased me.

199
00:06:31,243 --> 00:06:33,543
I ran away because someone chased after me.

200
00:06:34,210 --> 00:06:36,576
I run away instinctively when someone chases me.

201
00:06:37,376 --> 00:06:38,676
I'm really sorry, Sikyung.

202
00:06:38,676 --> 00:06:40,310
I thought I gave you the light aircraft.

203
00:06:41,243 --> 00:06:43,043
I thought it was the light aircraft.

204
00:06:43,043 --> 00:06:44,443
Let's see what this is.

205
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:46,476
What did Sikyung give me?

206
00:06:48,343 --> 00:06:50,043
Oh? Chamorro restaurant.

207
00:06:50,043 --> 00:06:52,543
Go to this restaurant and have a Chamorro meal.

208
00:06:52,543 --> 00:06:55,776
The barbecue and dessert is really good there.

209
00:06:55,776 --> 00:06:57,210
From L...

210
00:06:59,476 --> 00:07:01,010
Sikyung would've loved this.

211
00:07:01,843 --> 00:07:03,943
What do I do? I feel so sorry.

212
00:07:03,943 --> 00:07:06,710
I'll enjoy the Chamorro food for you.

213
00:07:06,710 --> 00:07:08,276
Sikyung, you can do it.

214
00:07:09,576 --> 00:07:12,243
(At that time, Sikyung was)

215
00:07:12,243 --> 00:07:14,810
(Losing his smile)

216
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:16,176
(Sigh)

217
00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:18,243
What am I doing?

218
00:07:21,676 --> 00:07:23,276
I'm going to kill Kim Sook.

219
00:07:24,910 --> 00:07:26,476
It's the elder's funeral today.

220
00:07:30,676 --> 00:07:32,043
They have fried rice.

221
00:07:34,210 --> 00:07:35,443
It looks good.

222
00:07:37,643 --> 00:07:40,010
Let's go before Sikyung catches us.

223
00:07:40,010 --> 00:07:41,043
Let's go.

224
00:07:41,043 --> 00:07:42,243
It's right in front of here.

225
00:07:42,710 --> 00:07:43,876
Let's go.

226
00:07:45,576 --> 00:07:48,443
(Viewer recommendations in Guam)

227
00:07:48,443 --> 00:07:50,710
(Sook, Chamorro restaurant)

228
00:07:50,710 --> 00:07:52,876
Let's get going.

229
00:07:53,676 --> 00:07:55,676
Let's try Chamorro food.

230
00:07:55,676 --> 00:07:57,143
Great thing I swapped with him.

231
00:07:57,143 --> 00:07:58,476
This is perfect for me.

232
00:07:59,610 --> 00:08:02,676
(Morning in Guam with a nice weather)

233
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:07,076
(Hotel)

234
00:08:07,076 --> 00:08:09,843
(3 minutes to Chamorro restaurant)

235
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:14,710
It's close.

236
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:17,776
You could just walk here.

237
00:08:17,776 --> 00:08:19,376
This is nice.

238
00:08:19,376 --> 00:08:20,743
Hi.

239
00:08:20,743 --> 00:08:21,510
Hafa adai.

240
00:08:23,310 --> 00:08:25,210
There aren't any customers right now.

241
00:08:27,076 --> 00:08:29,010
Guess they just opened.

242
00:08:29,010 --> 00:08:32,143
This is a Chamorro restaurant.

243
00:08:32,643 --> 00:08:33,910
The Chamorro are the indigenous people

244
00:08:33,910 --> 00:08:36,143
and this place makes traditional Guam food here.

245
00:08:36,143 --> 00:08:37,576
- Hi. / - Hi.

246
00:08:37,576 --> 00:08:38,543
Hafa adai.

247
00:08:38,543 --> 00:08:39,576
Hafa adai.

248
00:08:40,776 --> 00:08:41,843
It's your first time?

249
00:08:41,843 --> 00:08:43,443
Yeah, first time.

250
00:08:44,343 --> 00:08:46,343
Recommendation?

251
00:08:46,343 --> 00:08:48,910
The most popular. Barbecue.

252
00:08:48,910 --> 00:08:51,410
We have a combination trio.

253
00:08:51,410 --> 00:08:52,976
- Beef, pork, chicken. / - Combination.

254
00:08:52,976 --> 00:08:54,910
- Combination. This one. / - Everything.

255
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:56,110
Combination.

256
00:08:56,110 --> 00:08:57,643
- Combination. This one. / - Everything.

257
00:08:57,643 --> 00:08:59,510
- This one. / - One trio?

258
00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:00,943
Red rice or white rice?

259
00:09:02,043 --> 00:09:02,676
Red rice?

260
00:09:02,676 --> 00:09:04,343
Do I understand English now?

261
00:09:04,343 --> 00:09:06,143
I heard "red rice or white rice."

262
00:09:06,143 --> 00:09:08,443
- Red rice or white rice. / - Red rice is not spicy.

263
00:09:08,443 --> 00:09:10,276
It's famous. Very, very good.

264
00:09:11,143 --> 00:09:12,310
Red rice!

265
00:09:12,310 --> 00:09:13,776
Red rice! Yeah.

266
00:09:14,476 --> 00:09:15,743
And...

267
00:09:15,743 --> 00:09:16,876
Yeah, drink.

268
00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:18,376
The most popular drink,

269
00:09:18,376 --> 00:09:20,810
we have pretty good Italian soda.

270
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:22,243
You can choose mango,

271
00:09:22,243 --> 00:09:26,276
strawberry, raspberry or watermelon.

272
00:09:26,276 --> 00:09:27,943
Choose one flavor.

273
00:09:27,943 --> 00:09:28,743
Raspberry.

274
00:09:28,743 --> 00:09:29,776
- Raspberry. / - Raspberry.

275
00:09:29,776 --> 00:09:31,410
Yes.

276
00:09:32,276 --> 00:09:33,543
Italian soda.

277
00:09:33,543 --> 00:09:36,076
- Italian soda. / - Here we have raspberry Italian soda.

278
00:09:36,076 --> 00:09:37,176
Yeah, thank you.

279
00:09:37,176 --> 00:09:41,476
(Italian soda with raspberries, $3)

280
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:47,010
(Eyes widen)

281
00:09:47,043 --> 00:09:48,576
Soda usually

282
00:09:48,576 --> 00:09:50,543
is strongly carbonated.

283
00:09:50,543 --> 00:09:52,410
But this is smooth.

284
00:09:54,143 --> 00:09:55,176
It's so good.

285
00:09:55,976 --> 00:09:58,210
(Gulping)

286
00:09:58,210 --> 00:10:00,710
(Her uvula is working very hard)

287
00:10:06,843 --> 00:10:08,176
(Bottoms up)

288
00:10:08,176 --> 00:10:10,510
(The main menu isn't even here yet)

289
00:10:10,843 --> 00:10:12,610
(She wants more)

290
00:10:13,210 --> 00:10:15,543
(Waiter is back)

291
00:10:15,543 --> 00:10:16,976
I trust you.

292
00:10:16,976 --> 00:10:18,543
Yeah, recommendation.

293
00:10:18,543 --> 00:10:21,443
Would you like to try this root beer?

294
00:10:22,510 --> 00:10:23,943
Root beer?

295
00:10:23,943 --> 00:10:25,410
Root beer, no alcohol.

296
00:10:25,410 --> 00:10:26,743
American soda.

297
00:10:26,743 --> 00:10:28,610
- American soda? / - Yes.

298
00:10:30,143 --> 00:10:30,810
Agreed.

299
00:10:30,810 --> 00:10:32,543
- Okay. / - Yeah, okay.

300
00:10:32,543 --> 00:10:34,710
I've never heard of root beer before.

301
00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:37,076
This is root beer.

302
00:10:37,076 --> 00:10:38,510
And then, this is...

303
00:10:38,510 --> 00:10:40,776
Chamorro fruit punch.

304
00:10:42,643 --> 00:10:43,776
Is it on the house?

305
00:10:43,776 --> 00:10:44,476
Yes!

306
00:10:45,710 --> 00:10:47,943
Thank you!

307
00:10:47,943 --> 00:10:50,543
(You looked really thirsty)

308
00:10:50,843 --> 00:10:52,743
This is Chamorro fruit punch.

309
00:10:57,310 --> 00:10:58,510
This is unique.

310
00:10:58,510 --> 00:10:59,876
This is really unique.

311
00:11:01,310 --> 00:11:04,410
(She holds the cup and downs the drink)

312
00:11:04,410 --> 00:11:07,176
(The Chamorro drink is showing off its charm)

313
00:11:07,176 --> 00:11:08,643
It's kind of like tea.

314
00:11:08,643 --> 00:11:09,976
So in a way...

315
00:11:09,976 --> 00:11:11,943
It feels like tea.

316
00:11:11,943 --> 00:11:14,776
You can taste the raspberries and strawberries...

317
00:11:14,776 --> 00:11:16,410
It's between a soda and tea.

318
00:11:19,376 --> 00:11:20,910
It's not a strong flavor.

319
00:11:21,876 --> 00:11:23,576
I think people will like this.

320
00:11:24,143 --> 00:11:25,910
This is the Chamorro fruit punch.

321
00:11:29,576 --> 00:11:31,710
This is quite addictive.

322
00:11:32,576 --> 00:11:33,476
This is

323
00:11:33,476 --> 00:11:35,076
root beer.

324
00:11:37,143 --> 00:11:39,310
(What does root beer taste like?)

325
00:11:39,776 --> 00:11:41,543
(Wait a minute)

326
00:11:41,543 --> 00:11:43,176
(What is this taste?)

327
00:11:43,710 --> 00:11:46,643
(This tastes very familiar)

328
00:11:49,543 --> 00:11:51,343
(She remembers it at last)

329
00:11:51,876 --> 00:11:54,076
I didn't know you could drink pain reliever.

330
00:11:58,243 --> 00:11:59,743
This is so interesting.

331
00:12:01,776 --> 00:12:03,010
But this doesn't taste weird.

332
00:12:05,376 --> 00:12:06,743
It does taste like pain reliever.

333
00:12:09,710 --> 00:12:11,110
I prefer this one.

334
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:12,210
I prefer this one.

335
00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:13,810
This one is better.

336
00:12:14,176 --> 00:12:17,510
(Sook chooses the Chamorro fruit punch)

337
00:12:17,510 --> 00:12:18,876
Alright, here we go.

338
00:12:18,876 --> 00:12:19,776
It's here.

339
00:12:19,776 --> 00:12:21,010
Check this out.

340
00:12:21,010 --> 00:12:22,910
Big fella trio.

341
00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:26,976
(Chamorro-style barbecue)

342
00:12:26,976 --> 00:12:29,943
(The meat is marinated in soy sauce and vinegar)

343
00:12:30,610 --> 00:12:32,076
(Pork, beef, chicken)

344
00:12:32,076 --> 00:12:33,976
(You can taste 3 different kinds of meat at once)

345
00:12:34,743 --> 00:12:37,476
(Chamorro trio barbecue, $22.95)

346
00:12:39,410 --> 00:12:41,043
Let's start digging in then, shall we?

347
00:12:41,943 --> 00:12:44,143
The red rice is so...

348
00:12:44,143 --> 00:12:45,310
Let me taste it.

349
00:12:48,710 --> 00:12:51,443
It looks like the rice is strongly seasoned

350
00:12:51,443 --> 00:12:52,843
but it's just plain rice.

351
00:12:58,376 --> 00:13:00,176
(Let me see, which one should I eat first?)

352
00:13:00,676 --> 00:13:02,010
I'll eat the pork first.

353
00:13:08,043 --> 00:13:09,876
It tastes better when you eat off the bone.

354
00:13:15,476 --> 00:13:17,610
It's a very deliciously seasoned pork.

355
00:13:17,610 --> 00:13:19,343
You can clearly taste the charring

356
00:13:19,343 --> 00:13:21,643
and it's very juicy.

357
00:13:22,810 --> 00:13:24,310
It's a flavor you can't reject.

358
00:13:25,143 --> 00:13:28,610
(Sook really enjoys the pork)

359
00:13:32,376 --> 00:13:36,276
(Great food makes you the happiest)

360
00:13:38,043 --> 00:13:39,543
I can't put this down.

361
00:13:40,576 --> 00:13:43,843
(Only the bone remains)

362
00:13:44,610 --> 00:13:45,976
Let me try the beef.

363
00:13:45,976 --> 00:13:47,210
It looks like...

364
00:13:48,110 --> 00:13:49,210
L.A. ribs.

365
00:13:51,610 --> 00:13:53,910
It tastes like a Korean dish. The dish is very familiar.

366
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:55,943
It's like L.A. ribs for the rich.

367
00:13:56,843 --> 00:13:58,343
So much meat.

368
00:13:59,076 --> 00:14:01,210
It's a flavor you can't dislike. It's good.

369
00:14:01,210 --> 00:14:03,476
(This is delicious)

370
00:14:03,676 --> 00:14:04,643
Next.

371
00:14:07,276 --> 00:14:08,410
Chicken.

372
00:14:09,310 --> 00:14:12,376
It'd be weird if it looks like this and tastes bad.

373
00:14:12,376 --> 00:14:14,276
This has to be delicious.

374
00:14:20,476 --> 00:14:22,210
The skin is to die for.

375
00:14:22,210 --> 00:14:23,543
There's just the right amount of fattiness

376
00:14:23,543 --> 00:14:25,043
and seasoning.

377
00:14:25,043 --> 00:14:27,476
The chewy texture of the chicken is heightened.

378
00:14:27,476 --> 00:14:30,576
These make up for the dryness of chicken breast.

379
00:14:30,576 --> 00:14:32,376
This is so good.

380
00:14:34,176 --> 00:14:35,610
If I'm on a diet

381
00:14:35,610 --> 00:14:37,710
and this is the chicken breast I have to eat,

382
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:39,076
I'd definitely eat this.

383
00:14:39,076 --> 00:14:41,976
I completely understand

384
00:14:41,976 --> 00:14:43,976
why the viewer recommended this.

385
00:14:43,976 --> 00:14:45,643
It seems to be the best flavors

386
00:14:45,643 --> 00:14:47,876
you can get from a barbecue.

387
00:14:47,876 --> 00:14:49,710
The chicken, pork and

388
00:14:49,710 --> 00:14:51,243
beef, each have its own flavor.

389
00:14:52,243 --> 00:14:53,743
Sikyung, thank you so much.

390
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:56,276
Hey, this restaurant serves great food.

391
00:14:57,443 --> 00:15:00,076
(She fidgets with the menu)

392
00:15:00,076 --> 00:15:02,143
(Dessert menu)

393
00:15:07,276 --> 00:15:09,276
(My gosh, this is it)

394
00:15:09,276 --> 00:15:10,543
This is it.

395
00:15:10,543 --> 00:15:12,410
There are viewers who love desserts so...

396
00:15:13,343 --> 00:15:16,143
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

397
00:15:16,143 --> 00:15:17,676
There are 10 desserts.

398
00:15:17,676 --> 00:15:18,910
I'll just have...

399
00:15:20,143 --> 00:15:21,143
2

400
00:15:23,110 --> 00:15:23,876
No, 3.

401
00:15:26,743 --> 00:15:28,443
Chocolate wasabi cheesecake.

402
00:15:28,443 --> 00:15:29,910
I'll try the coconut banana...

403
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:32,076
Red velvet. I'll order these three.

404
00:15:34,443 --> 00:15:38,610
(3 cakes, $20.85)

405
00:15:38,610 --> 00:15:40,176
Wow, this is huge.

406
00:15:40,176 --> 00:15:42,110
This is coconut.

407
00:15:42,110 --> 00:15:43,143
Oh, banana.

408
00:15:43,143 --> 00:15:45,510
What is this? It's so pretty.

409
00:15:55,010 --> 00:15:56,810
The banana inside is so delicious.

410
00:15:58,143 --> 00:15:59,676
It's so soft.

411
00:16:02,643 --> 00:16:03,510
This one is

412
00:16:03,510 --> 00:16:05,343
chocolate wasabi cake.

413
00:16:06,243 --> 00:16:07,976
I can smell a hint of wasabi.

414
00:16:12,210 --> 00:16:13,576
Hey, this is good.

415
00:16:13,576 --> 00:16:16,710
The wasabi isn't tangy or pungent.

416
00:16:16,710 --> 00:16:18,743
The wasabi neutralizes the sweetness

417
00:16:18,743 --> 00:16:22,110
of the chocolates which can be too strong at times.

418
00:16:22,110 --> 00:16:24,143
In that respect,

419
00:16:24,143 --> 00:16:25,910
this is a rich chocolate cake.

420
00:16:26,776 --> 00:16:29,343
(Finally, the red velvet cake)

421
00:16:30,010 --> 00:16:32,310
There's a layer of cheese on top.

422
00:16:32,310 --> 00:16:33,610
I have to slice it well.

423
00:16:37,343 --> 00:16:41,576
(She eats it with both hands)

424
00:16:44,376 --> 00:16:46,043
(She seems satisfied)

425
00:16:46,043 --> 00:16:48,310
The surface seems really dry,

426
00:16:48,310 --> 00:16:49,243
but it's really moist.

427
00:16:50,376 --> 00:16:52,310
I will recommend the red velvet.

428
00:16:52,310 --> 00:16:53,510
It's the largest serving.

429
00:16:53,510 --> 00:16:56,143
It looks like it has two tiers.

430
00:16:56,843 --> 00:16:57,543
This one.

431
00:16:58,410 --> 00:17:00,876
The dish the viewer recommended...

432
00:17:02,343 --> 00:17:03,843
Was really good.

433
00:17:03,843 --> 00:17:05,676
Now, to rate this restaurant

434
00:17:05,676 --> 00:17:06,943
out of 5 points...

435
00:17:07,976 --> 00:17:10,143
(Thinking)

436
00:17:10,676 --> 00:17:11,910
I score it 4.5.

437
00:17:14,843 --> 00:17:18,876
(Sook's favorite dishes from today's meal)9

438
00:17:19,943 --> 00:17:21,676
Battle.

439
00:17:21,676 --> 00:17:22,643
Trip!

440
00:17:26,176 --> 00:17:28,243
I switched this with Sikyung.

441
00:17:28,243 --> 00:17:29,710
I really wanted to try this.

442
00:17:29,710 --> 00:17:31,110
Flyboard.

443
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:32,676
I really wanted to try this.

444
00:17:32,676 --> 00:17:36,843
(You can soar into the air using the water pressure)

445
00:17:36,843 --> 00:17:39,610
(You can feel like you're Iron Man on the water)

446
00:17:39,610 --> 00:17:42,410
(Flyboard, trending water activity)

447
00:17:42,410 --> 00:17:43,610
I really wanted to try this.

448
00:17:43,610 --> 00:17:47,276
This one caught my eyes right away.

449
00:17:47,276 --> 00:17:49,443
I want to know how it feels in the air.

450
00:17:49,443 --> 00:17:51,443
I want to find out how fun this is.

451
00:17:51,443 --> 00:17:54,243
(Viewer recommendations in Guam)

452
00:17:54,243 --> 00:17:56,443
(Hwijae, Flyboard)

453
00:17:57,176 --> 00:17:59,076
I can't believe I'm doing this in Guam.

454
00:17:59,076 --> 00:18:00,510
The weather is great.

455
00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:02,143
The air is fresh.

456
00:18:02,143 --> 00:18:03,243
I had delicious food.

457
00:18:04,176 --> 00:18:05,376
And now that I'm off to do an activity,

458
00:18:05,376 --> 00:18:06,843
I can't help but smile.

459
00:18:12,210 --> 00:18:13,376
What's this?

460
00:18:13,376 --> 00:18:14,376
Is this a factory?

461
00:18:15,276 --> 00:18:16,943
It looks like the inside of a military base.

462
00:18:18,076 --> 00:18:22,976
(Where am I? Am I on the right path?)

463
00:18:23,510 --> 00:18:25,110
People do the water activities here?

464
00:18:28,276 --> 00:18:32,510
(He's arrived at the right place but)

465
00:18:32,510 --> 00:18:33,576
Are you guys...

466
00:18:33,576 --> 00:18:35,310
Selling me off to a shrimp boat or something?

467
00:18:37,110 --> 00:18:39,276
I didn't know it was so far away.

468
00:18:40,210 --> 00:18:42,076
I've been to Guam a lot, but I've never been here.

469
00:18:44,443 --> 00:18:46,310
Hello. Hi. How are you?

470
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:50,843
This place is for Flyboarding?

471
00:18:52,210 --> 00:18:54,410
(You can see oil tankers and containers from here)

472
00:18:54,410 --> 00:18:57,110
(It's a natural area with depth as deep as 370m)

473
00:18:57,310 --> 00:19:01,110
(If you follow the suspicious path to the end)

474
00:19:01,110 --> 00:19:06,676
(You can enjoy all kinds of water activities)

475
00:19:06,676 --> 00:19:11,010
(Apra Harbor)

476
00:19:12,543 --> 00:19:14,310
I have changed my outfit

477
00:19:14,310 --> 00:19:16,310
to become Iron Man.

478
00:19:16,310 --> 00:19:17,376
Ta-da.

479
00:19:21,176 --> 00:19:23,810
(Flyboard, $85)

480
00:19:24,476 --> 00:19:25,176
Oh, my God.

481
00:19:26,476 --> 00:19:28,010
That guy's a real pro.

482
00:19:29,943 --> 00:19:30,943
He's the real Iron Man.

483
00:19:32,176 --> 00:19:34,676
(Can Hwijae keep his balance on the board?)

484
00:19:34,676 --> 00:19:36,710
I have been...

485
00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:38,276
Exercising all these years.

486
00:19:39,043 --> 00:19:39,676
I have to fly.

487
00:19:40,843 --> 00:19:43,276
(Shaking)

488
00:19:43,576 --> 00:19:45,543
(He's practicing to keep his balance on the swing)

489
00:19:45,543 --> 00:19:47,676
(Legs trembling)

490
00:19:48,943 --> 00:19:49,610
Oh, my God.

491
00:19:49,610 --> 00:19:50,876
- Are you okay? / - Yeah.

492
00:19:51,810 --> 00:19:54,876
(He practices one more time)

493
00:19:54,876 --> 00:19:55,476
What's happening?

494
00:19:55,676 --> 00:19:58,710
(His lower body is too weak)

495
00:19:58,710 --> 00:19:59,743
What's wrong with me?

496
00:20:01,610 --> 00:20:02,476
Okay.

497
00:20:02,476 --> 00:20:03,343
I want to try.

498
00:20:05,143 --> 00:20:06,343
Okay.

499
00:20:06,343 --> 00:20:07,176
Let's go.

500
00:20:08,276 --> 00:20:09,110
Okay.

501
00:20:10,576 --> 00:20:12,576
(It's time for him to become Iron Man)

502
00:20:12,576 --> 00:20:14,443
Okay. All the time.

503
00:20:14,443 --> 00:20:15,110
Alright.

504
00:20:16,876 --> 00:20:17,476
Okay.

505
00:20:17,476 --> 00:20:18,876
Let's go.

506
00:20:19,576 --> 00:20:21,210
(The engine's starting up)

507
00:20:21,843 --> 00:20:23,143
Oh, what is this?

508
00:20:25,810 --> 00:20:29,076
(He moves to the quayside)

509
00:20:32,076 --> 00:20:32,776
Okay.

510
00:20:33,676 --> 00:20:34,510
Alright.

511
00:20:35,743 --> 00:20:36,343
Alright.

512
00:20:38,576 --> 00:20:43,243
(Hwijae the Iron Man, sets out)

513
00:20:45,976 --> 00:20:47,276
Oh, my God.

514
00:20:47,276 --> 00:20:49,976
(Oh, my God?)

515
00:20:49,976 --> 00:20:51,110
Oh, my God.

516
00:20:52,610 --> 00:20:53,976
It's not easy, right?

517
00:20:55,076 --> 00:20:59,276
(He must keep his body up right)

518
00:20:59,276 --> 00:21:03,376
(It's a sport where one must keep the balance to fly)

519
00:21:04,710 --> 00:21:08,143
(However)

520
00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:09,976
Oh, my God.

521
00:21:11,543 --> 00:21:12,643
Oh, my God.

522
00:21:13,676 --> 00:21:15,010
This is no joke.

523
00:21:16,110 --> 00:21:21,376
(He couldn't stay balanced for the 1-year anniversary)

524
00:21:22,910 --> 00:21:26,076
(Hwijae can't give up like this)

525
00:21:28,443 --> 00:21:29,943
- Stand up first. / - Okay.

526
00:21:32,776 --> 00:21:35,676
(I won't fail anymore)

527
00:21:36,143 --> 00:21:38,676
(He keeps his legs straight)

528
00:21:39,110 --> 00:21:41,110
(He's totally focused)

529
00:21:42,610 --> 00:21:44,610
(He fails again)

530
00:21:45,776 --> 00:21:50,110
(He fails as his legs lose balance)

531
00:21:50,710 --> 00:21:54,043
(The sportsman faces humiliation)

532
00:21:54,043 --> 00:21:57,110
(I don't know if it's water or my tears)

533
00:21:57,976 --> 00:22:01,543
(Flyboarding isn't easy at all)

534
00:22:02,310 --> 00:22:03,610
(Splash)

535
00:22:03,610 --> 00:22:04,976
(Splash 2)

536
00:22:04,976 --> 00:22:07,143
(Splash 3)

537
00:22:07,143 --> 00:22:09,043
(Splash 4)

538
00:22:10,076 --> 00:22:11,343
Oh, sorry.

539
00:22:17,610 --> 00:22:20,710
(He's suddenly reminded of his twins)

540
00:22:21,043 --> 00:22:22,910
(Yes! I can do this!)

541
00:22:23,176 --> 00:22:25,376
(Motor on)

542
00:22:26,843 --> 00:22:29,610
(His posture seems more stable)

543
00:22:32,643 --> 00:22:34,710
(His two legs look strong too)

544
00:22:35,676 --> 00:22:38,043
(Daddy, you can do it!)

545
00:22:40,076 --> 00:22:49,443
(Hwijae finally flies out of the water)

546
00:22:49,443 --> 00:22:55,143
(It was thanks to the cheers from the twins)

547
00:23:00,310 --> 00:23:02,476
(Good job, good job)

548
00:23:02,943 --> 00:23:05,476
(He successfully flies in the sky)

549
00:23:07,510 --> 00:23:09,476
(Two thumbs up!)

550
00:23:11,476 --> 00:23:12,310
This is no joke.

551
00:23:19,043 --> 00:23:23,776
(The father of the twins prepares to fly higher)

552
00:23:28,076 --> 00:23:30,543
(He looks so serious)

553
00:23:36,676 --> 00:23:40,510
(The father of twins steadily floats into the air)

554
00:23:40,510 --> 00:23:44,443
(He won't allow his two legs to be shaky anymore)

555
00:23:44,810 --> 00:23:48,743
(The result of his effort provides a visible difference)

556
00:23:50,210 --> 00:23:55,343
(I won't fail again)

557
00:23:55,876 --> 00:24:00,576
(Now, it depends on how long he can fly in the air)

558
00:24:02,910 --> 00:24:04,943
(Good job)

559
00:24:05,443 --> 00:24:09,010
(Hwijae thoroughly enjoys flying above the water)

560
00:24:10,143 --> 00:24:12,843
(Looking relaxed)

561
00:24:13,643 --> 00:24:17,776
(Hwijae can fly in the air like Iron Man at last)

562
00:24:19,143 --> 00:24:22,910
(He shows you that you can do anything)

563
00:24:22,910 --> 00:24:25,210
(If you don't give up)

564
00:24:28,110 --> 00:24:34,810
(He takes his time to enjoy the sky)

565
00:24:43,143 --> 00:24:48,910
(Hwijae is utterly happy with his success)

566
00:24:56,476 --> 00:24:59,910
(Let's go now)

567
00:25:02,876 --> 00:25:03,943
Rather than Iron Man...

568
00:25:11,076 --> 00:25:12,343
I've become a mess.

569
00:25:13,710 --> 00:25:16,776
(Before Flyboarding, after Flyboarding)

570
00:25:17,110 --> 00:25:19,710
Sook, I know what you're doing. Stop eating.

571
00:25:19,710 --> 00:25:21,376
Sikyung, this is the thing to do in Guam.

572
00:25:22,176 --> 00:25:24,043
If you enjoy the adrenaline rush and

573
00:25:24,043 --> 00:25:25,443
water activities...

574
00:25:25,443 --> 00:25:26,976
Out of 5, this scores...

575
00:25:26,976 --> 00:25:27,943
100 points.

576
00:25:29,043 --> 00:25:29,843
Iron Man.

577
00:25:30,776 --> 00:25:31,710
Stark.

578
00:25:41,976 --> 00:25:44,676
(Viewer recommendations in Guam)

579
00:25:44,676 --> 00:25:46,943
(Sikyung, self-wedding photo shoot)

580
00:25:47,710 --> 00:25:48,510
Done.

581
00:25:52,010 --> 00:25:52,676
Hey!

582
00:25:54,376 --> 00:25:55,710
It's a wedding shoot.

583
00:25:57,310 --> 00:25:58,676
(Just as Sook did a self-wedding shoot in Jeju-do)

584
00:25:58,676 --> 00:26:00,243
(Please try it at Two Lovers Point and give us tips)

585
00:26:00,610 --> 00:26:01,843
This is it.

586
00:26:04,910 --> 00:26:05,576
Oh, my back...

587
00:26:05,576 --> 00:26:07,576
My back is too fat.

588
00:26:07,576 --> 00:26:09,143
I need someone to massage my back.

589
00:26:09,776 --> 00:26:11,076
1, 2, 3.

590
00:26:13,876 --> 00:26:17,743
(How will Sikyung's wedding photo shoot look?)

591
00:26:18,043 --> 00:26:19,676
(Current temperature, 31??

592
00:26:19,676 --> 00:26:21,010
This is the worst. The worst.

593
00:26:21,010 --> 00:26:22,710
A wedding photo shoot in this weather?

594
00:26:24,876 --> 00:26:25,843
This is like...

595
00:26:27,576 --> 00:26:28,910
Asking a beggar...

596
00:26:30,243 --> 00:26:32,276
To play a rich man for the day.

597
00:26:33,676 --> 00:26:35,210
(Sighing)

598
00:26:35,710 --> 00:26:37,543
So I go and pick out my tuxedo now, right?

599
00:26:38,910 --> 00:26:40,143
(Hotel)

600
00:26:40,143 --> 00:26:40,943
(Tuxedo shop)

601
00:26:40,943 --> 00:26:43,143
(8 minutes)

602
00:26:43,976 --> 00:26:46,810
(A tuxedo hire shop near the hotel)

603
00:26:48,276 --> 00:26:51,043
I can't believe they actually have this here.

604
00:26:54,876 --> 00:26:58,710
(Posing like the photo)

605
00:27:01,543 --> 00:27:02,243
Hello.

606
00:27:04,110 --> 00:27:07,743
(The shop is full of fancy tuxedos)

607
00:27:08,643 --> 00:27:12,310
(You can buy and hire suits here)

608
00:27:13,843 --> 00:27:16,976
I'm the poor guy who needs the suit.

609
00:27:19,510 --> 00:27:23,010
I'm going to be shooting a wedding shot by myself.

610
00:27:23,010 --> 00:27:24,110
Okay.

611
00:27:24,110 --> 00:27:25,976
- What's your name again? / - Rose.

612
00:27:25,976 --> 00:27:27,443
- Rose? / - Yes.

613
00:27:27,443 --> 00:27:28,943
This is Rose.

614
00:27:28,943 --> 00:27:30,310
Yes, Rose.

615
00:27:30,310 --> 00:27:31,843
You know that, right?

616
00:27:31,843 --> 00:27:32,743
It's a beautiful name.

617
00:27:33,576 --> 00:27:34,943
Right here, sir.

618
00:27:34,943 --> 00:27:35,810
Thank you.

619
00:27:36,810 --> 00:27:37,876
The arms are too short.

620
00:27:38,610 --> 00:27:39,176
Oh, my God.

621
00:27:39,176 --> 00:27:40,676
I have long arms.

622
00:27:42,776 --> 00:27:45,143
I look like a poor groom.

623
00:27:45,143 --> 00:27:46,410
I said the arms are too short

624
00:27:46,410 --> 00:27:47,576
and she gave me this.

625
00:27:50,410 --> 00:27:51,510
Yo, this is hip hop.

626
00:27:54,810 --> 00:27:59,810
(He finds his swag in Guam of all places)

627
00:28:00,576 --> 00:28:01,643
What's up, brother?

628
00:28:02,643 --> 00:28:03,776
What's happening, bro?

629
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:08,310
What am I doing?

630
00:28:09,476 --> 00:28:11,276
I'll try just one more.

631
00:28:12,610 --> 00:28:14,743
Rose is doing her best.

632
00:28:15,843 --> 00:28:18,043
Is there a... Aloha shirts here?

633
00:28:18,043 --> 00:28:19,510
Yes, we do.

634
00:28:21,043 --> 00:28:25,476
(Hawaiian shirts are commonly used in wedding shoots)

635
00:28:26,343 --> 00:28:27,243
How about pink?

636
00:28:31,110 --> 00:28:33,343
(Pink, if you're a real man)

637
00:28:33,343 --> 00:28:34,343
Blue.

638
00:28:35,776 --> 00:28:36,776
How does it look?

639
00:28:36,776 --> 00:28:38,410
I want an earring too.

640
00:28:49,510 --> 00:28:50,443
Thank you.

641
00:28:51,243 --> 00:28:52,410
I'll live happily.

642
00:28:58,276 --> 00:28:59,443
(Tuxedo shop)

643
00:28:59,443 --> 00:29:02,376
(13 minutes to Two Lovers Point)

644
00:29:03,943 --> 00:29:06,510
(Two Lovers Point)

645
00:29:06,510 --> 00:29:08,876
(Legend states that two lovers)

646
00:29:08,876 --> 00:29:11,643
(Tied their hair together and jumped off here)

647
00:29:15,876 --> 00:29:23,176
(Many come here for their wedding shoots)

648
00:29:25,776 --> 00:29:30,910
(Two Lovers Point)

649
00:29:32,176 --> 00:29:33,543
I'm here at Two Lovers Point.

650
00:29:34,443 --> 00:29:36,676
I look insane. Dressed like this in this weather.

651
00:29:37,043 --> 00:29:40,810
(Where did the Sikyung from this morning go?)

652
00:29:41,176 --> 00:29:42,176
If you look here,

653
00:29:42,176 --> 00:29:44,710
you will realize I'm more famous than dolphins here.

654
00:29:44,710 --> 00:29:45,576
Check this out.

655
00:29:47,876 --> 00:29:48,876
They're Koreans.

656
00:29:48,876 --> 00:29:51,176
Here on a group tour.

657
00:29:51,176 --> 00:29:53,176
I must hurry to the famous spot

658
00:29:53,176 --> 00:29:55,443
and quickly take the photos since it's embarrassing.

659
00:29:56,476 --> 00:30:02,376
(Photo spot 1, the big heart)

660
00:30:10,676 --> 00:30:15,910
(Is it our imagination that he looks pitiful?)

661
00:30:16,910 --> 00:30:20,010
(Everyone's in summer clothes)

662
00:30:20,010 --> 00:30:21,110
It's so hot.

663
00:30:24,076 --> 00:30:26,210
(Sweating so much)

664
00:30:30,410 --> 00:30:34,043
(He begins the self-wedding shoot)

665
00:30:36,210 --> 00:30:38,310
(Using the remote to control the camera)

666
00:30:39,410 --> 00:30:42,976
(Remote in his hand)

667
00:30:43,076 --> 00:30:47,076
(Still, Sikyung does his best)

668
00:30:47,476 --> 00:30:50,110
(He strikes a pose)

669
00:30:50,110 --> 00:30:54,176
(Then wipes his sweat)

670
00:30:55,010 --> 00:30:58,343
(The precious first photo)

671
00:31:00,876 --> 00:31:02,476
I'm seriously going to murder Sook.

672
00:31:04,276 --> 00:31:05,676
It's the elder's funeral today.

673
00:31:10,810 --> 00:31:16,910
(Photo spot 2, bronze statue of legend)

674
00:31:19,810 --> 00:31:23,743
(He's angry but still does his best)

675
00:31:24,276 --> 00:31:26,310
(He makes use of the bouquet)

676
00:31:27,043 --> 00:31:30,843
(With the lovers from the sad legend)

677
00:31:31,776 --> 00:31:37,443
(With the elder that gave me this joy)

678
00:31:38,243 --> 00:31:40,843
(Good thing you did the self-wedding shoot, right?)

679
00:31:43,376 --> 00:31:44,310
There's glare.

680
00:31:46,143 --> 00:31:48,410
(He looks like a groom)

681
00:31:48,410 --> 00:31:51,410
(Is it your wedding today?)

682
00:31:51,410 --> 00:31:53,976
(I'm just doing the wedding shoot alone)

683
00:31:53,976 --> 00:31:55,176
I need the ocean in the picture.

684
00:31:56,710 --> 00:31:59,343
I seriously look like a crazy person!

685
00:32:01,476 --> 00:32:07,910
(He calms himself down and takes another one)

686
00:32:08,376 --> 00:32:12,076
(I'm feeling good now)

687
00:32:12,076 --> 00:32:15,243
(I'm feeling really good)

688
00:32:16,376 --> 00:32:17,910
(A couple taking pictures for each other)

689
00:32:18,143 --> 00:32:19,276
(Watching)

690
00:32:19,276 --> 00:32:21,010
Would you like me to take one for you?

691
00:32:22,043 --> 00:32:22,910
Would you like to borrow this?

692
00:32:22,910 --> 00:32:24,076
- Aren't you Sung Sikyung? / - Yes...

693
00:32:25,110 --> 00:32:26,076
Honey, it's Sung Sikyung!

694
00:32:26,076 --> 00:32:27,510
- What? / - It's Sung Sikyung!

695
00:32:27,510 --> 00:32:28,110
Yes, yes.

696
00:32:28,810 --> 00:32:32,110
(With a tuxedo on, he takes pictures of other couple)

697
00:32:32,843 --> 00:32:35,876
(He's so passionate)

698
00:32:36,576 --> 00:32:37,610
I think it looks okay.

699
00:32:38,310 --> 00:32:40,276
Wow, that's a great photo.

700
00:32:40,276 --> 00:32:41,410
- You're so handsome. / - Thank you.

701
00:32:41,410 --> 00:32:42,176
Thank you.

702
00:32:43,443 --> 00:32:44,410
Let's take one here.

703
00:32:49,010 --> 00:32:49,943
Take one of these for me.

704
00:32:51,776 --> 00:32:55,276
(I'm not lonely at all)

705
00:32:55,276 --> 00:32:56,310
Let's go!

706
00:32:57,110 --> 00:32:58,176
Is it enough?

707
00:32:58,176 --> 00:32:59,610
- Yes. / - I want to get changed.

708
00:32:59,610 --> 00:33:00,376
- To the car. / - I want to get changed.

709
00:33:02,376 --> 00:33:03,643
I want to look like a local prince.

710
00:33:06,010 --> 00:33:08,343
(Ta-da)

711
00:33:09,476 --> 00:33:10,910
(He looks coy)

712
00:33:10,910 --> 00:33:13,043
(The earrings to make him look like royalty)

713
00:33:14,310 --> 00:33:18,310
(Feeling good with light clothes on)

714
00:33:19,076 --> 00:33:22,110
(A Guam prince meeting Koreans)

715
00:33:23,310 --> 00:33:27,643
(Photo spot 3, ocean backdrop at the observatory)

716

(Entrance fee to observatory, $3)

717
00:33:31,943 --> 00:33:33,110
You're so handsome.

718
00:33:33,910 --> 00:33:35,210
It's because I'm wearing sunglasses.

719
00:33:37,976 --> 00:33:40,243
(Heading to the photo spot)

720
00:33:40,543 --> 00:33:41,843
Let me take one for you.

721
00:33:41,843 --> 00:33:42,976
This is unbelievable.

722
00:33:45,410 --> 00:33:46,143
Let me...

723
00:33:51,243 --> 00:33:53,410
(Frozen)

724
00:33:53,410 --> 00:33:54,276
It's broken.

725
00:33:55,643 --> 00:33:58,376
- What do we do? / - Is the screen cracked or...

726
00:33:58,376 --> 00:33:59,410
No, it's broken.

727
00:34:00,710 --> 00:34:03,743
I'll send you the money for the repair.

728
00:34:04,943 --> 00:34:07,476
- I'm sorry to cause trouble on your trip. / - It's okay.

729
00:34:07,476 --> 00:34:10,076
I feel bad. You were only offering to help us.

730
00:34:10,076 --> 00:34:11,276
Because of this bloody bouquet!

731
00:34:12,110 --> 00:34:12,976
I'm so sorry.

732
00:34:14,310 --> 00:34:15,843
I promise I will pay the repair bill.

733
00:34:18,176 --> 00:34:20,443
You're making us feel bad.

734
00:34:20,443 --> 00:34:21,943
I'm so sorry that I'm lost for words.

735
00:34:21,943 --> 00:34:22,910
I'll take your photo first.

736
00:34:25,176 --> 00:34:26,843
- I'll try to get a lot of sky into the shot. / - Okay.

737
00:34:30,643 --> 00:34:32,076
There's a glare so...

738
00:34:33,810 --> 00:34:36,910
(A photo for the price of a phone screen)

739
00:34:37,376 --> 00:34:40,776
(A memorable trip for all)

740
00:34:41,010 --> 00:34:44,476
(Fortunately, they later told us the phone was fine)

741
00:34:44,476 --> 00:34:45,476
(It was only the case and screen protector that broke )

742
00:34:45,476 --> 00:34:46,576
(The phone is fine)

743
00:34:47,410 --> 00:34:48,310
Press it.

744
00:34:49,210 --> 00:34:50,143
Press.

745
00:34:50,810 --> 00:34:51,676
Try it.

746
00:34:52,676 --> 00:34:56,143
(The bouquet that caused me pain)

747
00:34:57,210 --> 00:35:02,543
(We invite you to Sikyung's solo wedding)

748
00:35:02,543 --> 00:35:07,343
(You'll come, right?)

749
00:35:07,343 --> 00:35:08,910
Let's live happily ever after.

750
00:35:10,576 --> 00:35:12,276
(Embarrassed)

751
00:35:12,443 --> 00:35:14,176
Can I go now?

752
00:35:16,876 --> 00:35:19,376
(Sikyung's self-wedding photo shoot is over)

753
00:35:19,376 --> 00:35:22,043
(Viewer recommendations in Guam)

754
00:35:22,043 --> 00:35:24,310
(Sook, light aircraft)

755
00:35:25,110 --> 00:35:26,143
Shall we go?

756
00:35:26,910 --> 00:35:28,443
Gosh, I'm full.

757
00:35:28,443 --> 00:35:29,876
It was a good decision to order three.

758
00:35:32,610 --> 00:35:34,343
(Chamorro traditional restaurant)

759
00:35:34,343 --> 00:35:36,610
(18 minutes to light airport)

760
00:35:39,676 --> 00:35:40,576
It's here.

761
00:35:41,943 --> 00:35:43,643
There are planes over there.

762
00:35:45,076 --> 00:35:46,476
There are so many.

763
00:35:53,643 --> 00:36:00,310
(Flying in the blue sky in Guam will get you excited)

764
00:36:05,910 --> 00:36:14,110
(The cute light aircraft will take Sook to the sky)

765
00:36:14,476 --> 00:36:16,210
I've been in one of these before.

766
00:36:16,743 --> 00:36:20,143
I think the one with Sohyun was similar to this.

767
00:36:20,143 --> 00:36:21,010
I'm excited.

768
00:36:21,976 --> 00:36:24,410
I remember having lots of fun the time.

769
00:36:25,510 --> 00:36:28,476
(October 15th, 2016, Jeolla-do trip)

770
00:36:29,043 --> 00:36:33,010
(Sook rode a light aircraft during her trip to Jeolla-do)

771
00:36:33,010 --> 00:36:34,910
It's so pretty.

772
00:36:35,576 --> 00:36:38,210
(She rode one at the time)

773
00:36:38,210 --> 00:36:43,310
(But today she'll fly one)

774
00:36:45,576 --> 00:36:48,843
(Will she be able to fly it okay?)

775
00:36:50,410 --> 00:36:51,910
I will fly it myself?

776
00:36:52,543 --> 00:36:54,643
(She is worried)

777
00:36:55,143 --> 00:36:55,743
Hello.

778
00:36:55,743 --> 00:36:58,343
- Hi. / - I'll be your instructor.

779
00:36:58,343 --> 00:36:59,910
- Nice to meet you. / - Nice to meet you.

780
00:36:59,910 --> 00:37:01,276
My name is Nanda Kim.

781
00:37:01,276 --> 00:37:02,976
- Nice to meet you. / - Nanda, Nanda.

782
00:37:03,976 --> 00:37:05,943
Course G is an exciting course.

783
00:37:05,943 --> 00:37:07,776
I like it.

784
00:37:07,776 --> 00:37:09,543
We're flying for 30 minutes.

785
00:37:09,543 --> 00:37:11,510
- 30 minutes? / - Okay.

786
00:37:11,510 --> 00:37:12,410
Is this course for children?

787
00:37:12,410 --> 00:37:14,076
- This is for juniors? / - Yes.

788
00:37:16,376 --> 00:37:18,176
Even children can do this.

789
00:37:18,176 --> 00:37:20,043
So I don't need to worry.

790
00:37:20,043 --> 00:37:23,943
Okay, this is the airport. Guam International Airport.

791
00:37:23,943 --> 00:37:25,743
We're going to the Two Lovers Point.

792
00:37:26,910 --> 00:37:28,376
This is Two Lovers Point.

793
00:37:29,176 --> 00:37:31,110
This is where Sikyung is shooting.

794
00:37:33,043 --> 00:37:34,943
Seriously, I'm going to murder Sook.

795
00:37:34,943 --> 00:37:37,810
So you will see the Tumon Beach.

796
00:37:37,810 --> 00:37:40,343
- And? / - We'll go all the way to Apra Harbor.

797
00:37:40,343 --> 00:37:42,010
This is Apra Harbor?

798
00:37:42,010 --> 00:37:43,176
Here?

799
00:37:43,176 --> 00:37:45,243
I can see Hwijae here. Okay.

800
00:37:45,243 --> 00:37:46,343
- Alright? / - Yeah.

801
00:37:46,343 --> 00:37:47,343
I like it.

802
00:37:48,210 --> 00:37:53,010
(After a quick training, you can fly the light aircraft)

803
00:37:56,076 --> 00:37:56,910
- No. / - No.

804
00:38:00,010 --> 00:38:00,743
I'm nervous.

805
00:38:03,376 --> 00:38:06,143
The aircraft is prettier than I thought.

806
00:38:08,910 --> 00:38:10,010
I'm so nervous.

807
00:38:11,010 --> 00:38:15,110
(The professional pilot sits next to you for a safe flight)

808
00:38:15,643 --> 00:38:19,043
(You can pay for 1 and have 2 more in the back)

809
00:38:19,043 --> 00:38:20,743
My goodness.

810
00:38:20,743 --> 00:38:22,143
What is this?

811
00:38:22,143 --> 00:38:23,743
This is amazing.

812
00:38:23,743 --> 00:38:25,776
- Captain. / - Yes.

813
00:38:25,776 --> 00:38:28,543
How many times have you flown?

814
00:38:28,543 --> 00:38:31,310
A little over 4,000 hours of flight time.

815
00:38:31,310 --> 00:38:33,143
- 4,000? / - Yes.

816
00:38:34,776 --> 00:38:35,576
Okay.

817
00:38:38,443 --> 00:38:41,810
(Doing a bit of slapstick now that she's relaxed)

818
00:38:44,076 --> 00:38:47,043
(Ready)

819
00:38:47,043 --> 00:38:51,476
(They're ready)

820
00:38:52,676 --> 00:38:55,176
(This is awesome)

821
00:38:56,343 --> 00:38:59,376
(It's time to fly the light aircraft)

822
00:39:01,276 --> 00:39:02,243
It's moving.

823
00:39:04,110 --> 00:39:05,776
Here we go.

824
00:39:07,976 --> 00:39:13,143
(As the engine gets louder, she looks nervous)

825
00:39:13,976 --> 00:39:16,676
You have the controls now.

826
00:39:17,676 --> 00:39:19,143
I'm actually in control?

827
00:39:21,076 --> 00:39:24,076
(She has to make the aircraft take off)

828
00:39:24,976 --> 00:39:27,310
(She's excited and nervous at the same time)

829
00:39:33,976 --> 00:39:36,243
(Now pull it yourself)

830
00:39:41,910 --> 00:39:45,043
(As she slowly pulls the controller)

831
00:39:45,043 --> 00:39:49,476
(The aircraft starts to fly like magic)

832
00:39:57,943 --> 00:40:00,810
(Sook successfully flies an aircraft)

833
00:40:00,810 --> 00:40:03,276
I made it fly. I made it fly.

834
00:40:04,610 --> 00:40:06,876
I made it fly. I made it fly.

835
00:40:12,010 --> 00:40:14,110
Did you see? I made it took off.

836
00:40:14,110 --> 00:40:19,376
(Feeling exhilarated about taking off the aircraft herself)

837
00:40:26,343 --> 00:40:35,843
(A beginner pilot's exciting first flight)

838
00:40:39,410 --> 00:40:46,110
(As she calms down, she sees the beauty of Guam)

839
00:40:47,210 --> 00:40:51,043
Look at the color of the water.

840
00:41:02,276 --> 00:41:04,176
Gosh, it's so pretty.

841
00:41:06,443 --> 00:41:08,210
This is incredible.

842
00:41:11,043 --> 00:41:14,743
- We'll take a left now. / - Left.

843
00:41:15,310 --> 00:41:17,610
(Trembling)

844
00:41:18,510 --> 00:41:20,910
(Turning)

845
00:41:21,810 --> 00:41:25,376
(She successfully made a left turn)

846
00:41:38,076 --> 00:41:39,076
Oh, here?

847
00:41:39,443 --> 00:41:40,710
Go this way?

848
00:41:42,076 --> 00:41:44,976
(First up, Two Lovers Point)

849
00:41:44,976 --> 00:41:46,643
It looks amazing.

850
00:41:47,743 --> 00:41:49,776
I bet Sikyung's there somewhere.

851
00:41:50,210 --> 00:41:53,276
Sikyung, I'm here!

852
00:41:53,743 --> 00:41:57,076
I'm here and you're there!

853
00:41:57,743 --> 00:42:00,143
Are you having fun taking wedding pictures?

854
00:42:00,610 --> 00:42:02,510
You're dead once you get down here.

855
00:42:03,476 --> 00:42:05,643
How can you make me do this

856
00:42:05,643 --> 00:42:07,510
and have fun on that?

857
00:42:13,043 --> 00:42:14,643
It's so pretty.

858
00:42:14,643 --> 00:42:18,676
(The second course, Tumon Beach)

859
00:42:19,243 --> 00:42:22,110
I think I'm going to like Guam a lot.

860
00:42:24,376 --> 00:42:28,343
(The third course, Apra Harbor)

861
00:42:29,076 --> 00:42:32,343
Wow, isn't that Hwijae?

862
00:42:33,276 --> 00:42:35,376
Hwijae!

863
00:42:41,643 --> 00:42:44,076
Hwijae, good luck!

864
00:42:45,210 --> 00:42:46,910
Left turn.

865
00:42:48,876 --> 00:42:52,310
(She mastered how to turn now)

866
00:42:53,243 --> 00:42:56,610
(After Apra Harbor, Sook's plane returns)

867
00:42:57,643 --> 00:42:59,710
(Slowly, you'll fly lower)

868
00:43:01,743 --> 00:43:03,743
(What's going on?)

869
00:43:04,910 --> 00:43:08,210
(Wobbling)

870
00:43:10,510 --> 00:43:14,710
(Landing is the most difficult part in flying a plane)

871
00:43:17,010 --> 00:43:18,410
Can I do a good job in landing?

872
00:43:22,043 --> 00:43:24,410
(Nervous)

873
00:43:25,743 --> 00:43:30,510
(Both novice and experienced pilots are nervous)

874
00:43:31,576 --> 00:43:35,110
(The airplane is shaking violently)

875
00:43:36,876 --> 00:43:38,743
Please maintain the balance.

876
00:43:51,443 --> 00:43:56,310
(The novice pilot is preparing to land)

877
00:43:56,810 --> 00:44:00,676
(Can she succeed in one try?)

878
00:44:06,610 --> 00:44:08,010
Good landing.

879
00:44:09,010 --> 00:44:09,943
Good, good, good.

880
00:44:09,943 --> 00:44:13,210
(She must've been scared)

881
00:44:13,576 --> 00:44:15,410
My heart was racing when I was landing the plane.

882
00:44:17,743 --> 00:44:21,043
Good flying. Very good.

883
00:44:21,043 --> 00:44:23,476
I'm still alive.

884
00:44:23,476 --> 00:44:24,676
I'm sorry, I'll get out a bit later.

885
00:44:24,676 --> 00:44:27,010
I think I peed a little.

886
00:44:37,543 --> 00:44:39,210
The landing was scary.

887
00:44:39,210 --> 00:44:42,243
But when I was up in the air,

888
00:44:42,243 --> 00:44:45,176
I felt touched because I was

889
00:44:45,176 --> 00:44:46,676
flying the plane.

890
00:44:46,676 --> 00:44:49,776
There's an enormous difference in looking at Guam

891
00:44:49,776 --> 00:44:51,076
from the ground and from the sky.

892
00:44:51,976 --> 00:44:53,910
I have to give it a score, right?

893
00:44:54,610 --> 00:44:55,976
So the score is...

894
00:44:57,110 --> 00:44:59,543
I have to consider the cost.

895
00:45:00,610 --> 00:45:03,176
If you're rich, it's worth 5 points.

896
00:45:03,176 --> 00:45:06,910
(If you're rich, it's worth 5 points)

897
00:45:13,876 --> 00:45:16,443
Well, what I've chosen is...

898
00:45:16,443 --> 00:45:18,543
An eatery.

899
00:45:18,543 --> 00:45:21,010
This restaurant specializes in shrimp dishes.

900
00:45:21,010 --> 00:45:24,210
We have to go there.

901
00:45:24,210 --> 00:45:25,510
Do you go there often?

902
00:45:25,510 --> 00:45:29,276
I go there at least twice whenever I come to Guam.

903
00:45:29,276 --> 00:45:31,210
And I noticed they have

904
00:45:31,210 --> 00:45:32,810
a branch in front of our hotel.

905
00:45:32,810 --> 00:45:34,543
The head restaurant is in downtown

906
00:45:34,543 --> 00:45:35,743
and you have to line up to eat there.

907
00:45:35,743 --> 00:45:39,376
The head restaurant is small, but this branch is big.

908
00:45:39,376 --> 00:45:41,110
You have to go here

909
00:45:41,110 --> 00:45:42,310
and try the shrimp.

910
00:45:43,743 --> 00:45:49,310
(This is the shrimp you must eat in Guam)

911
00:45:51,076 --> 00:45:54,743
(The shrimp will be revealed soon)

912
00:45:54,743 --> 00:45:57,576
(Viewer recommendations in Guam)

913
00:45:57,576 --> 00:46:00,810
(Hwijae, shrimp restaurant)

914
00:46:00,810 --> 00:46:03,110
We'll go taste some shrimps.

915
00:46:03,110 --> 00:46:07,243
There are shuttle buses everywhere in Guam

916
00:46:07,243 --> 00:46:09,943
so you can go anywhere in downtown for free.

917
00:46:09,943 --> 00:46:12,743
But this shrimp restaurant is

918
00:46:12,743 --> 00:46:16,010
right in front of our hotel.

919
00:46:19,443 --> 00:46:20,943
It's right in front of it.

920
00:46:23,576 --> 00:46:24,843
It's right in front of it.

921
00:46:25,410 --> 00:46:28,010
That's our hotel.

922
00:46:28,010 --> 00:46:32,243
And there's the shrimp restaurant.

923
00:46:33,376 --> 00:46:37,176
(He's very excited about shrimp)

924
00:46:38,376 --> 00:46:39,543
Let's go!

925
00:46:42,610 --> 00:46:44,710
(The restaurant is full of customers)

926
00:46:44,710 --> 00:46:50,710
(Inside is decorated with shrimps everywhere)

927
00:46:52,310 --> 00:46:53,910
(There are couples)

928
00:46:54,376 --> 00:46:56,143
(There are friends)

929
00:46:56,576 --> 00:46:58,443
(And there are families)

930
00:46:58,943 --> 00:47:01,143
(Hwijae, try the shrimp)

931
00:47:01,610 --> 00:47:03,810
(Hwijae is ordering)

932
00:47:03,943 --> 00:47:05,843
One garlic.

933
00:47:06,610 --> 00:47:08,743
Coconut shrimp.

934
00:47:08,743 --> 00:47:11,810
- This is also one of our favorites. / - This is my favorite.

935
00:47:11,810 --> 00:47:13,043
My favorite.

936
00:47:13,043 --> 00:47:14,776
- Thank you. / - Thank you.

937
00:47:17,010 --> 00:47:18,343
I'm salivating.

938
00:47:19,376 --> 00:47:23,276
(Coconut shrimp is being cooked in the kitchen)

939
00:47:24,743 --> 00:47:27,210
(Nicely fried)

940
00:47:28,076 --> 00:47:30,510
(Placed in a bowl and it's done)

941
00:47:31,510 --> 00:47:34,676
(Coconut shrimp, $17.99)

942
00:47:36,310 --> 00:47:36,843
Let's go.

943
00:47:36,843 --> 00:47:37,910
I have your favorite.

944
00:47:37,910 --> 00:47:39,110
Yes, it's my favorite.

945
00:47:39,643 --> 00:47:40,876
This is the coconut shrimp.

946
00:47:42,176 --> 00:47:44,576
- Thank you. / - Please enjoy.

947
00:47:45,410 --> 00:47:46,643
Everyone.

948
00:47:47,143 --> 00:47:50,676
You may doubt how good this is

949
00:47:50,676 --> 00:47:53,343
but this is beyond your imagination.

950
00:47:54,776 --> 00:47:56,010
Drench it.

951
00:47:56,010 --> 00:47:57,210
It's not that spicy.

952
00:47:58,476 --> 00:48:01,043
Then you eat it right away.

953
00:48:04,276 --> 00:48:07,310
(His nostrils are widened)

954
00:48:09,076 --> 00:48:10,076
This...

955
00:48:10,876 --> 00:48:14,376
I want to sell this at baseball stadiums in Korea.

956
00:48:18,543 --> 00:48:20,610
(Fantastic)

957
00:48:20,910 --> 00:48:23,476
It doesn't have a strong flavor,

958
00:48:23,476 --> 00:48:25,376
so the kids love it.

959
00:48:25,376 --> 00:48:29,243
The meat in here is fresh.

960
00:48:29,243 --> 00:48:33,076
So rather than it being plump, it spreads in your mouth.

961
00:48:33,076 --> 00:48:37,210
It's fried evenly and so crunchy.

962
00:48:38,176 --> 00:48:40,443
Also, it's so savory

963
00:48:40,443 --> 00:48:44,076
because of the coconut powder on the outside.

964
00:48:44,076 --> 00:48:45,676
As you chew it,

965
00:48:45,676 --> 00:48:47,943
you can taste the coconut.

966
00:48:47,943 --> 00:48:50,010
That's the highlight.

967
00:48:50,510 --> 00:48:53,543
Someone has to be next to you...

968
00:48:54,243 --> 00:48:55,676
To restrain you.

969
00:48:55,676 --> 00:49:01,843
(Otherwise you won't stop eating it)

970
00:49:02,310 --> 00:49:04,510
(Please someone stop me)

971
00:49:05,076 --> 00:49:07,110
(Here comes the waiter who will stop him)

972
00:49:07,610 --> 00:49:10,376
(What's the next dish that will stop him?)

973
00:49:10,776 --> 00:49:16,176
(Gambas cooked in Guam style)

974
00:49:17,410 --> 00:49:19,776
(Gambas, $16.99)

975
00:49:20,010 --> 00:49:23,010
Don't just eat the shrimp.

976
00:49:23,010 --> 00:49:26,176
Take a piece of bread

977
00:49:26,176 --> 00:49:28,543
and dip it in sauce.

978
00:49:33,510 --> 00:49:37,076
(Yes, this is it)

979
00:49:38,643 --> 00:49:41,043
This isn't just delicious.

980
00:49:41,043 --> 00:49:44,110
You'll think, "What is this?" It's that good.

981
00:49:45,510 --> 00:49:48,476
It's a bit different from Korean gambas.

982
00:49:48,476 --> 00:49:50,176
It's both spicy

983
00:49:50,176 --> 00:49:51,643
and sweet.

984
00:49:51,643 --> 00:49:53,943
Spicy and sweet.

985
00:49:54,676 --> 00:49:57,276
Then you mix rice in it.

986
00:49:57,276 --> 00:50:02,976
(You mix rice in the sauce)

987
00:50:07,310 --> 00:50:10,110
(He faints because it's so good)

988
00:50:10,543 --> 00:50:13,143
It has a mild garlic flavor

989
00:50:13,143 --> 00:50:16,676
and the sauce is perfect for Koreans.

990
00:50:17,243 --> 00:50:20,876
And this is what makes the garlic shrimp complete.

991
00:50:21,310 --> 00:50:24,610
First, you take a spoonful of rice.

992
00:50:24,610 --> 00:50:26,643
Dip it in the sauce slightly.

993
00:50:26,643 --> 00:50:28,210
Just a little bit.

994
00:50:28,210 --> 00:50:32,376
Then you place a shrimp on top.

995
00:50:32,376 --> 00:50:36,043
It's a combination of sauce, rice and shrimp.

996
00:50:36,610 --> 00:50:39,076
This is Guam's triple combo.

997
00:50:43,243 --> 00:50:45,843
(His nostrils only tell the truth)

998
00:50:46,976 --> 00:50:49,276
I'm feel bad because I'm eating this alone.

999
00:50:49,876 --> 00:50:52,876
(He wants to share this with the others)

1000
00:50:53,443 --> 00:50:55,676
This is crazy.

1001
00:50:55,676 --> 00:50:56,976
Thank you.

1002
00:51:01,643 --> 00:51:05,143
Viewer G, recommended this place.

1003
00:51:05,143 --> 00:51:08,543
I can't help it. This restaurant...

1004
00:51:09,376 --> 00:51:12,310
I give it 5 out of 5.

1005
00:51:12,310 --> 00:51:16,076
This is a place you must visit

1006
00:51:16,076 --> 00:51:17,643
in your schedule.

1007
00:51:17,643 --> 00:51:20,310
Please come here and enjoy it.

1008
00:51:20,843 --> 00:51:27,776
(Like me)

1009
00:51:29,943 --> 00:51:32,610
(Viewer recommendations in Guam)

1010
00:51:32,610 --> 00:51:34,943
(Sikyung, supermarket shopping)

1011
00:51:35,843 --> 00:51:39,043
(A viewer recommended a supermarket tour)

1012
00:51:39,043 --> 00:51:41,310
There's a place Sikyung would like.

1013
00:51:41,310 --> 00:51:44,010
There's an American supermarket in Guam.

1014
00:51:45,276 --> 00:51:47,543
It's enormous.

1015
00:51:47,543 --> 00:51:49,376
People shop there...

1016
00:51:49,910 --> 00:51:52,276
And post the pictures on social medias,

1017
00:51:52,276 --> 00:51:53,976
bragging about what they bought.

1018
00:51:56,710 --> 00:51:59,576
(In Guam, one must shop at the supermarkets)

1019
00:51:59,776 --> 00:52:03,776
(10 minutes from Two Lovers Point to the supermarket)

1020
00:52:06,510 --> 00:52:08,643
These are suggestions the viewers sent in

1021
00:52:08,643 --> 00:52:11,476
about things that you can only buy

1022
00:52:11,476 --> 00:52:13,543
here in Guam.

1023
00:52:15,176 --> 00:52:16,876
It feels like America.

1024
00:52:17,943 --> 00:52:18,976
This is America...

1025
00:52:20,143 --> 00:52:21,843
But they have wooden chopsticks.

1026
00:52:21,843 --> 00:52:23,276
(Korean writing)

1027
00:52:23,810 --> 00:52:25,743
(Fascinated)

1028
00:52:28,976 --> 00:52:30,910
If you look over here,

1029
00:52:30,910 --> 00:52:32,943
there's kimchi flavored popcorn.

1030
00:52:32,943 --> 00:52:36,843
One of the viewers recommended this. Only sold here.

1031
00:52:37,510 --> 00:52:38,743
It's kimchi flavor.

1032
00:52:40,310 --> 00:52:41,976
This might actually not be that bad.

1033
00:52:42,876 --> 00:52:45,776
This is something you can't find in Korea.

1034
00:52:45,776 --> 00:52:47,876
You can spray it on chips.

1035
00:52:49,276 --> 00:52:51,843
To satisfy our viewers' curiosity...

1036
00:52:54,010 --> 00:52:55,310
And, everyone.

1037
00:52:57,676 --> 00:53:00,210
Whenever you go abroad, always buy potato chips.

1038
00:53:00,210 --> 00:53:01,876
They never eat it alone.

1039
00:53:01,876 --> 00:53:04,376
They always dip it in all of these.

1040
00:53:04,376 --> 00:53:06,043
These are all dips.

1041
00:53:06,043 --> 00:53:07,576
They're always displayed together.

1042
00:53:08,176 --> 00:53:09,843
I think this is the difference between them and us.

1043
00:53:11,210 --> 00:53:13,610
(What is he buying next?)

1044
00:53:13,876 --> 00:53:15,543
This is low-fat.

1045
00:53:17,176 --> 00:53:19,376
They have a "golden" flavored Oreo.

1046
00:53:21,343 --> 00:53:24,010
This looks good too, right? Red velvet.

1047
00:53:25,043 --> 00:53:26,043
This looks good.

1048
00:53:26,043 --> 00:53:27,943
Maybe I should send this to Sook.

1049
00:53:28,710 --> 00:53:31,410
Okay. No, wait. Kim Sook! Wedding!

1050
00:53:31,610 --> 00:53:33,643
Kim Sook! Wedding!

1051
00:53:34,376 --> 00:53:37,343
I sowed the wind and reaped the whirlwind.

1052
00:53:38,143 --> 00:53:41,010
(Mommy)

1053
00:53:42,310 --> 00:53:48,210
(He didn't know back then)

1054
00:53:49,043 --> 00:53:50,810
(I'm sweating from my eyes)

1055
00:53:50,810 --> 00:53:52,310
What is this?

1056
00:53:53,776 --> 00:53:59,310
(Just like the phone, he had a mental breakdown)

1057
00:54:00,076 --> 00:54:02,743
I'm so sleepy because I sweated so much.

1058
00:54:03,210 --> 00:54:04,943
I should buy ham.

1059
00:54:06,043 --> 00:54:08,910
(Thinking of buying ham makes him happy)

1060
00:54:08,910 --> 00:54:09,810
Let's go find ham.

1061
00:54:09,810 --> 00:54:11,710
You have a variety of hams when you're overseas.

1062
00:54:12,776 --> 00:54:14,476
Let me buy a few of them.

1063
00:54:14,476 --> 00:54:15,710
This one is good too.

1064
00:54:16,910 --> 00:54:18,143
This one looks delicious.

1065
00:54:19,043 --> 00:54:21,243
American hams are very salty.

1066
00:54:21,243 --> 00:54:22,010
That's why they're delicious.

1067
00:54:22,010 --> 00:54:24,143
This is Portuguese sausage flavor.

1068
00:54:24,143 --> 00:54:26,976
That is oven-roasted turkey flavor.

1069
00:54:26,976 --> 00:54:28,943
This one is bacon flavor.

1070
00:54:28,943 --> 00:54:30,043
Chorizo flavor.

1071
00:54:30,043 --> 00:54:31,143
I found an interesting one.

1072
00:54:31,143 --> 00:54:32,743
Black pepper sounds good.

1073
00:54:34,810 --> 00:54:36,210
This doesn't sound bad.

1074
00:54:36,943 --> 00:54:38,043
Teriyaki flavor.

1075
00:54:42,076 --> 00:54:44,743
This and rice is going to be my dinner today.

1076
00:54:47,076 --> 00:54:48,910
Even the color of the packages are so pretty.

1077
00:54:50,143 --> 00:54:51,876
I want to collect them.

1078
00:54:53,543 --> 00:54:55,776
(He heads to the next section)

1079
00:54:55,776 --> 00:54:57,943
This is the drug section.

1080
00:55:02,143 --> 00:55:02,810
Interesting, right?

1081
00:55:02,810 --> 00:55:06,810
Chocolate stimulant laxative. What does this mean?

1082
00:55:07,310 --> 00:55:10,510
It relieves your intestinal problems.

1083
00:55:11,010 --> 00:55:12,743
And it tastes like chocolate.

1084
00:55:12,743 --> 00:55:14,543
One of the writers of Battle Trip said

1085
00:55:14,543 --> 00:55:17,276
they had intestinal issues and this fixed them up.

1086
00:55:17,276 --> 00:55:19,143
So we will take this as well

1087
00:55:19,143 --> 00:55:21,210
since you can only buy it here.

1088
00:55:22,376 --> 00:55:23,543
Since we found something that is good for you,

1089
00:55:23,543 --> 00:55:26,110
now we are going to find something that harms you.

1090
00:55:26,110 --> 00:55:28,643
Let's go to the beer section and get cold beer.

1091
00:55:31,643 --> 00:55:33,810
I've tried Guam beer.

1092
00:55:33,810 --> 00:55:35,910
Banana flavor.

1093
00:55:38,076 --> 00:55:40,010
Apple ale.

1094
00:55:40,010 --> 00:55:41,976
This is normal.

1095
00:55:41,976 --> 00:55:43,476
If you like different kinds of beer,

1096
00:55:43,476 --> 00:55:44,976
you should try these.

1097
00:55:46,976 --> 00:55:49,610
This is how Americans

1098
00:55:49,610 --> 00:55:50,876
visit their friends.

1099
00:55:50,876 --> 00:55:52,310
Like, "Let's drink till we drop."

1100
00:55:52,310 --> 00:55:53,776
With a bottle of tequila under their arms.

1101
00:55:58,510 --> 00:55:59,610
Let's go.

1102
00:55:59,610 --> 00:56:01,910
(When did he buy so many?)

1103
00:56:06,443 --> 00:56:10,876
(So much stuff)

1104
00:56:12,276 --> 00:56:13,810
Let's go.

1105
00:56:13,810 --> 00:56:18,376
(He will try these soon and review them)

1106
00:56:19,876 --> 00:56:24,376
(The long day is almost over)

1107
00:56:24,376 --> 00:56:25,676
- Hwijae. / - Yes.

1108
00:56:25,676 --> 00:56:28,043
I can feel freedom here.

1109
00:56:28,043 --> 00:56:29,810
- Right? / - This place is inner peace itself.

1110
00:56:29,810 --> 00:56:31,010
It is indeed.

1111
00:56:31,776 --> 00:56:35,476
- The weather is so nice. / - Look at the beach.

1112
00:56:35,476 --> 00:56:37,743
- Look at the families. / - Boys are running around.

1113
00:56:37,743 --> 00:56:40,443
- They're hanging out. / - This is great.

1114
00:56:40,810 --> 00:56:42,410
This is how you have fun.

1115
00:56:42,410 --> 00:56:43,610
(Ypao Beach)

1116
00:56:43,610 --> 00:56:45,510
(With rest areas, barbecues and other amenities)

1117
00:56:45,510 --> 00:56:46,443
(It's the biggest park and a popular beach in Guam)

1118
00:56:47,043 --> 00:56:48,376
This is how life should be, right?

1119
00:56:48,376 --> 00:56:51,510
Sikyung said he's going to cook something.

1120
00:56:52,210 --> 00:56:55,476
- At the cliff... / - I wonder if he got good photos.

1121
00:56:55,476 --> 00:56:57,576
- Also, Hwijae... / - Over there...

1122
00:56:57,576 --> 00:57:01,210
- That pink shirt... / - Isn't that his manager?

1123
00:57:01,210 --> 00:57:02,743
Is Sikyung wearing a pink shirt?

1124
00:57:04,043 --> 00:57:06,410
Let's take a picture.

1125
00:57:07,410 --> 00:57:08,910
Let's take a picture of Sikyung.

1126
00:57:08,910 --> 00:57:10,443
Sikyung.

1127
00:57:14,210 --> 00:57:15,376
Hey, Sikyung.

1128
00:57:17,010 --> 00:57:18,943
You don't have to do all this.

1129
00:57:19,476 --> 00:57:22,110
- Sikyung, are you trying to impress? / - Sikyung.

1130
00:57:22,776 --> 00:57:24,010
Sikyung.

1131
00:57:24,476 --> 00:57:25,343
Go away.

1132
00:57:25,343 --> 00:57:27,876
- Sikyung, are you trying to impress? / - Sikyung.

1133
00:57:27,876 --> 00:57:30,310
(Huh?)

1134
00:57:30,310 --> 00:57:31,710
Sikyung, are you okay?

1135
00:57:32,776 --> 00:57:35,343
- Why are you suffering, manager? / - What is this?

1136
00:57:36,143 --> 00:57:38,243
(The manager is the sous-chef)

1137
00:57:38,243 --> 00:57:43,543
(Fries and fries some more)

1138
00:57:43,543 --> 00:57:46,076
(He fries meat as well)

1139
00:57:46,376 --> 00:57:48,610
- We'll help you. / - It smells good.

1140
00:57:48,610 --> 00:57:49,443
- We'll help. / - Nothing to help.

1141
00:57:49,443 --> 00:57:51,810
Having you here is confusing me.

1142
00:57:51,810 --> 00:57:52,410
Why?

1143
00:57:52,410 --> 00:57:53,910
Please have a seat and drink beer.

1144
00:57:54,876 --> 00:57:56,976
That's great news for us.

1145
00:57:57,776 --> 00:57:58,810
Is there anything you want to eat?

1146
00:57:58,810 --> 00:58:01,210
They say we can do barbecue on the beach.

1147
00:58:01,210 --> 00:58:03,143
That sounds amazing. Let's do that.

1148
00:58:03,143 --> 00:58:05,843
- Sunset barbecue. / - Would you like me to cook?

1149
00:58:05,843 --> 00:58:07,976
- We can just order, can't we? / - I like everything.

1150
00:58:07,976 --> 00:58:10,143
- Oh! / - Let's go grocery shopping there and...

1151
00:58:10,143 --> 00:58:12,010
- Could you make steaks for us? / - Make us steaks.

1152
00:58:12,010 --> 00:58:13,143
There must be a local way

1153
00:58:13,143 --> 00:58:14,676
to grill steaks there.

1154
00:58:14,676 --> 00:58:16,676
What I did before was pan-frying.

1155
00:58:16,676 --> 00:58:18,876
I'm sure the locals are better than me.

1156
00:58:18,876 --> 00:58:22,243
I'm asking if you'd like something else on the fire.

1157
00:58:23,910 --> 00:58:25,310
Could you make us stir-fried glass noodles?

1158
00:58:26,043 --> 00:58:27,476
Alright. I'll make it for you.

1159
00:58:27,476 --> 00:58:29,176
- You can cook that? / - You can?

1160
00:58:29,710 --> 00:58:32,043
Yes, it's just a bother...

1161
00:58:32,043 --> 00:58:35,410
You want to eat that with the sunset in Guam?

1162
00:58:35,810 --> 00:58:37,643
You want to eat glass noodles in Guam?

1163
00:58:37,643 --> 00:58:41,043
- I feel like we need it for a feast. / - Shrimp for me.

1164
00:58:41,510 --> 00:58:42,276
We need to take it from Korea.

1165
00:58:42,276 --> 00:58:43,443
- Gambas. / - Shrimp.

1166
00:58:44,310 --> 00:58:45,643
Please grill shrimps.

1167
00:58:45,643 --> 00:58:47,276
- You want me to grill shrimps? / - Yes.

1168
00:58:47,276 --> 00:58:50,010
- You said it's a barbecue. / - Just grill it yourself.

1169
00:58:51,343 --> 00:58:53,276
- That's just... / - He wants to cook something.

1170
00:58:53,276 --> 00:58:54,310
- Oh, on the fire? / - Yes.

1171
00:58:54,310 --> 00:58:58,043
- Just on a gas stove... / - Something with seasoning.

1172
00:58:58,043 --> 00:59:00,943
(Cooking?)

1173
00:59:01,843 --> 00:59:04,810
(That's how Sikyung ended up)

1174
00:59:05,410 --> 00:59:08,410
(Preparing a meal for the 2-year-anniversary special)

1175
00:59:08,410 --> 00:59:11,843
Since I have to cook there,

1176
00:59:11,843 --> 00:59:14,376
I will take some basic seasonings.

1177
00:59:16,810 --> 00:59:18,510
Barbecue

1178
00:59:18,510 --> 00:59:21,010
has a high likelihood of failure.

1179
00:59:21,543 --> 00:59:23,776
It's not a time to brag about my cooking skills.

1180
00:59:23,776 --> 00:59:25,776
I should show something that the viewers can do.

1181
00:59:25,776 --> 00:59:27,476
What should I cook then?

1182
00:59:27,476 --> 00:59:29,710
I should cook something that can never be bad.

1183
00:59:30,676 --> 00:59:32,576
So this is what I'm going to cook.

1184
00:59:33,776 --> 00:59:35,743
(Sizzle)

1185
00:59:36,110 --> 00:59:38,943
(It's beef and shrimp with Sikyung's special sauce)

1186
00:59:39,576 --> 00:59:40,410
(On a lightly toasted tortilla)

1187
00:59:40,410 --> 00:59:43,310
Sour cream, green guacamole, salsa.

1188
00:59:43,310 --> 00:59:45,410
I'll buy the red, green and white sauces.

1189
00:59:46,510 --> 00:59:48,610
(Deeply impressed)

1190
00:59:50,176 --> 00:59:51,776
It's Mexican food.

1191
00:59:53,343 --> 00:59:54,943
What are you going to make?

1192
00:59:55,576 --> 00:59:57,076
What are you making?

1193
00:59:57,076 --> 00:59:58,576
This is so hard.

1194
00:59:59,576 --> 01:00:03,910
(Cooking at a barbecue place)

1195
01:00:04,410 --> 01:00:05,876
Don't we have electricity?

1196
01:00:06,743 --> 01:00:07,810
Come out already.

1197
01:00:08,310 --> 01:00:09,876
The knife is so dull.

1198
01:00:09,876 --> 01:00:12,110
Is there anything you can't do, Sikyung?

1199
01:00:12,110 --> 01:00:13,176
You're good at everything.

1200
01:00:14,076 --> 01:00:15,110
(Sikyung's table)

1201
01:00:15,110 --> 01:00:18,410
(First dish, Sikyung's taco)

1202
01:00:18,410 --> 01:00:21,276
(He will make guacamole first)

1203
01:00:22,310 --> 01:00:25,343
(Take out the seed)

1204
01:00:25,343 --> 01:00:29,943
(Add salt and pepper)

1205
01:00:30,276 --> 01:00:32,210
(Let's make Sikyung's taco now)

1206
01:00:32,210 --> 01:00:34,843
(Prepare the vegetables and meat)

1207
01:00:34,843 --> 01:00:37,943
Now, let's make the sauce.

1208
01:00:38,043 --> 01:00:44,043
(Add garlic, peppers, and various spices in olive oil)

1209
01:00:44,043 --> 01:00:45,676
Looks delicious.

1210
01:00:46,643 --> 01:00:48,243
I'll make it not too spicy.

1211
01:00:50,543 --> 01:00:52,410
(It's quite good)

1212
01:00:52,610 --> 01:00:59,310
(Marinate the meat in Sikyung's special sauce)

1213
01:00:59,310 --> 01:01:02,776
(Stir-fry the marinated meat)

1214
01:01:03,410 --> 01:01:04,976
I can't wait to try it.

1215
01:01:07,743 --> 01:01:09,510
(His cooking went on until it became dark)

1216
01:01:09,510 --> 01:01:11,943
- Please say it tastes good. / - Of course.

1217
01:01:13,876 --> 01:01:16,043
It smells incredible.

1218
01:01:16,043 --> 01:01:18,376
(They're very excited)

1219
01:01:18,576 --> 01:01:20,210
Please show us how you eat it.

1220
01:01:25,276 --> 01:01:27,410
Take one piece of tortilla.

1221
01:01:27,810 --> 01:01:29,876
- Put some meat on it. / - Add meat.

1222
01:01:29,876 --> 01:01:32,610
- Add some meat. / - Three slices of meat.

1223
01:01:33,443 --> 01:01:35,743
Next, add the shrimp.

1224
01:01:35,743 --> 01:01:38,676
- Then the onions. / - Onions.

1225
01:01:40,110 --> 01:01:42,143
(With fried paprika)

1226
01:01:42,143 --> 01:01:43,443
It looks good already.

1227
01:01:43,443 --> 01:01:46,076
Add plenty of each sauce.

1228
01:01:46,076 --> 01:01:48,510
- Plenty of... / - You don't want too little.

1229
01:01:48,510 --> 01:01:51,743
Oh, my. It looks so good.

1230
01:01:55,176 --> 01:01:57,810
You have to be able to wrap it though.

1231
01:01:57,810 --> 01:02:00,043
- I think I put too much. / - Let's try.

1232
01:02:00,043 --> 01:02:01,776
It's supposed to be eaten in big mouthfuls.

1233
01:02:01,776 --> 01:02:03,876
- Okay, let's go. Wrap it. / - Let's go.

1234
01:02:06,843 --> 01:02:09,976
The three colors are so pretty.

1235
01:02:17,310 --> 01:02:19,043
(Mmm)

1236
01:02:21,210 --> 01:02:22,410
Oh, yeah!

1237
01:02:23,176 --> 01:02:25,210
- It's so good. / - It's good.

1238
01:02:25,210 --> 01:02:27,843
- Not bad? / - Not just not bad.

1239
01:02:28,576 --> 01:02:30,610
I think this is the best food I ate in Guam.

1240
01:02:31,210 --> 01:02:32,976
(Sikyung feels proud)

1241
01:02:32,976 --> 01:02:33,910
Sikyung...

1242
01:02:34,476 --> 01:02:37,576
Let's open a restaurant in Korea.

1243
01:02:39,076 --> 01:02:40,376
It's really good.

1244
01:02:40,976 --> 01:02:43,243
Avocadoes are cheap and good here.

1245
01:02:43,243 --> 01:02:45,776
Just scoop it out and season with salt and pepper.

1246
01:02:46,610 --> 01:02:48,743
Every supermarket in America sells this.

1247
01:02:48,743 --> 01:02:51,976
Salsa sauce. And this as well.

1248
01:02:51,976 --> 01:02:55,210
So just add cumin to this and marinade it...

1249
01:02:55,210 --> 01:02:56,510
- Add what? / - Cumin.

1250
01:02:56,510 --> 01:02:59,310
You know at lamb skewer restaurants,

1251
01:02:59,310 --> 01:03:01,976
they give you red seasoning and seed-like things.

1252
01:03:01,976 --> 01:03:04,110
They sell that like this here.

1253
01:03:04,576 --> 01:03:07,110
This and cilantro, garlic and pepper.

1254
01:03:07,110 --> 01:03:08,110
Fish sauce.

1255
01:03:09,643 --> 01:03:11,176
Add it all and let it marinade.

1256
01:03:11,176 --> 01:03:12,676
But I didn't have time to marinade this.

1257
01:03:13,510 --> 01:03:15,343
- This is so good. / - This is so good.

1258
01:03:16,143 --> 01:03:17,776
It's good for your health. Eat some more.

1259
01:03:18,943 --> 01:03:20,176
I don't usually like to eat food like this,

1260
01:03:20,176 --> 01:03:21,143
but this is good.

1261
01:03:21,810 --> 01:03:23,310
I usually can't eat onions.

1262
01:03:23,310 --> 01:03:24,210
- Really? / - Yeah.

1263
01:03:24,210 --> 01:03:26,043
But this is so good.

1264
01:03:26,043 --> 01:03:28,110
I really shouldn't eat so much.

1265
01:03:32,243 --> 01:03:34,110
Thank you for enjoying it so much.

1266
01:03:34,643 --> 01:03:35,976
This is amazing.

1267
01:03:35,976 --> 01:03:37,810
Since we don't have a lot of time,

1268
01:03:37,810 --> 01:03:39,343
I'll make the pasta right away.

1269
01:03:40,410 --> 01:03:42,110
- You're going to cook pasta? / - Yes.

1270
01:03:42,110 --> 01:03:43,776
I don't think you'll need to.

1271
01:03:44,543 --> 01:03:46,143
- Isn't this enough? / - It won't even take 10 minutes.

1272
01:03:46,576 --> 01:03:47,810
All the preparations are complete.

1273
01:03:48,810 --> 01:03:50,110
(Sikyung's table)

1274
01:03:50,110 --> 01:03:52,610
(The second dish, rice cake pasta)

1275
01:03:52,776 --> 01:03:57,043
(Fry rice cakes in a pan with meat grease)

1276
01:03:57,043 --> 01:04:01,643
(Add the onions you've fried pre-hand)

1277
01:04:01,643 --> 01:04:03,310
(Then add cherry tomatoes)

1278
01:04:03,310 --> 01:04:05,676
When the tomatoes start peeling,

1279
01:04:05,676 --> 01:04:07,910
season it with balsamic vinegar.

1280
01:04:07,910 --> 01:04:09,743
Then add some mozzarella cheese.

1281
01:04:09,743 --> 01:04:14,210
(Add mozzarella cheese and season to your taste)

1282
01:04:15,376 --> 01:04:17,810
(When the cheese starts to stretch, it's done)

1283
01:04:19,210 --> 01:04:21,343
(Confirms the cheese before serving it)

1284
01:04:21,743 --> 01:04:22,910
Sook.

1285
01:04:22,910 --> 01:04:24,676
- What is that? / - I need two dishes.

1286
01:04:26,910 --> 01:04:28,443
Gosh, what is this?

1287
01:04:29,610 --> 01:04:30,576
Rice cake pasta?

1288
01:04:30,976 --> 01:04:32,710
This is amazing.

1289
01:04:32,710 --> 01:04:34,876
This is insane.

1290
01:04:34,876 --> 01:04:37,310
What did you do to the rice cakes?

1291
01:04:37,310 --> 01:04:39,110
Does Guam have rice cakes?

1292
01:04:39,110 --> 01:04:41,010
- I brought it from Korea. / - Oh, my God.

1293
01:04:42,110 --> 01:04:44,643
(I need to eat this first)

1294
01:04:46,476 --> 01:04:47,576
Is it good?

1295
01:04:51,010 --> 01:04:51,943
What is this?

1296
01:04:51,943 --> 01:04:54,643
It's insane. Sikyung, this is insane.

1297
01:04:54,643 --> 01:04:56,176
- Isn't it delicious? / - What is this?

1298
01:04:57,843 --> 01:04:58,776
This is so...

1299
01:04:58,776 --> 01:05:01,643
I learned this from Chef Kim Sohui.

1300
01:05:01,643 --> 01:05:02,810
The one that uses the Busan dialect.

1301
01:05:02,810 --> 01:05:05,410
- She has her hair up. / - From Austria?

1302
01:05:05,410 --> 01:05:06,543
Yes.

1303
01:05:06,543 --> 01:05:08,243
You can't get this wrong.

1304
01:05:08,243 --> 01:05:09,110
It's really delicious.

1305
01:05:10,110 --> 01:05:11,010
(I forgot)

1306
01:05:11,010 --> 01:05:13,443
I add

1307
01:05:13,443 --> 01:05:16,743
the pork rinds from earlier.

1308
01:05:16,743 --> 01:05:17,643
Eat it together.

1309
01:05:17,643 --> 01:05:19,410
Chef Kim Sohui taught you this?

1310
01:05:19,410 --> 01:05:22,076
Yes, the base is soy sauce.

1311
01:05:22,076 --> 01:05:24,410
Yes, I thought I tasted soy sauce.

1312
01:05:25,276 --> 01:05:28,043
(Everyone will like this)

1313
01:05:28,043 --> 01:05:29,676
My kids will love this.

1314
01:05:29,676 --> 01:05:30,643
Yes, the kids will like it.

1315
01:05:30,643 --> 01:05:34,010
Sikyung will be loved when he gets married.

1316
01:05:38,876 --> 01:05:41,176
It tastes different with the rinds.

1317
01:05:41,176 --> 01:05:43,210
This is really good.

1318
01:05:43,210 --> 01:05:44,543
I'm glad you like it.

1319
01:05:46,876 --> 01:05:50,343
(Sikyung is satisfied)

1320
01:05:50,343 --> 01:05:52,543
How does rice cake tastes like this?

1321
01:05:52,943 --> 01:05:55,910
It's great as a snack with drinks and as a meal.

1322
01:05:55,910 --> 01:05:58,710
Why do the tomatoes go so well with this?

1323
01:05:58,710 --> 01:06:00,676
I love rice cakes.

1324
01:06:00,676 --> 01:06:02,643
I've never seen you eat this much.

1325
01:06:02,643 --> 01:06:03,910
I usually eat a lot.

1326
01:06:03,910 --> 01:06:05,043
- Really? / - Yes.

1327
01:06:07,210 --> 01:06:09,743
- This is the finishing touch. / - Good work, Sikyung.

1328
01:06:09,743 --> 01:06:12,310
- Good job. / - Thank you for enjoying it.

1329
01:06:12,310 --> 01:06:14,376
It was so good. It was perfect.

1330
01:06:14,376 --> 01:06:15,610
I really worried about what to cook.

1331
01:06:15,610 --> 01:06:17,776
This is the best food

1332
01:06:17,776 --> 01:06:20,143
I've had in Guam.

1333
01:06:20,143 --> 01:06:20,976
I'll give you 5 points.

1334
01:06:20,976 --> 01:06:23,476
- I didn't know taco tasted this good. / - 5 points.

1335
01:06:24,010 --> 01:06:25,743
- Taco... / - I didn't know...

1336
01:06:25,743 --> 01:06:28,110
You could cook all this here.

1337
01:06:28,110 --> 01:06:29,710
The reason I made these...

1338
01:06:29,710 --> 01:06:31,976
If you cook meat outside...

1339
01:06:31,976 --> 01:06:34,276
You can buy these three here.

1340
01:06:35,010 --> 01:06:37,276
Anything tastes good in this.

1341
01:06:37,910 --> 01:06:40,143
Eat it with seasoned meat.

1342
01:06:41,143 --> 01:06:43,143
This is healthy and delicious.

1343
01:06:43,143 --> 01:06:43,943
Okay.

1344
01:06:44,643 --> 01:06:46,076
I'm so happy.

1345
01:06:46,076 --> 01:06:47,910
What did you do today? Tell me.

1346
01:06:47,910 --> 01:06:50,210
- Sook? / - Yes?

1347
01:06:50,210 --> 01:06:53,176
I have to put something straight with Sikyung.

1348
01:06:53,176 --> 01:06:54,876
Why did you run away earlier?

1349
01:06:54,876 --> 01:06:56,076
I'll fly in the air for you.

1350
01:06:56,076 --> 01:06:59,276
Okay, you take this then.

1351
01:07:00,076 --> 01:07:01,143
Done?

1352
01:07:01,143 --> 01:07:03,176
If I go here... We're done.

1353
01:07:04,410 --> 01:07:06,543
(Sikyung saw it)

1354
01:07:07,243 --> 01:07:08,643
- I'll get going now. / - Hey!

1355
01:07:09,310 --> 01:07:10,276
No way!

1356
01:07:10,276 --> 01:07:12,710
Sook, run! Run!

1357
01:07:12,710 --> 01:07:15,076
I didn't run away.

1358
01:07:15,076 --> 01:07:16,476
- To be honest... / - Why are you so fast?

1359
01:07:17,143 --> 01:07:18,543
It was so annoying.

1360
01:07:19,110 --> 01:07:20,476
I thought she was a bullet.

1361
01:07:20,476 --> 01:07:21,810
All animals...

1362
01:07:22,976 --> 01:07:23,710
No.

1363
01:07:23,710 --> 01:07:26,843
All animals become real fast when

1364
01:07:26,843 --> 01:07:27,810
they're in danger.

1365
01:07:27,810 --> 01:07:31,043
I thought I gave him the light aircraft one.

1366
01:07:31,043 --> 01:07:33,510
But he chased after me, so I ran away.

1367
01:07:33,510 --> 01:07:34,343
It was funnier

1368
01:07:34,343 --> 01:07:36,910
because you didn't get caught.

1369
01:07:36,910 --> 01:07:38,643
That's such a relief.

1370
01:07:38,643 --> 01:07:40,643
If I had caught her...

1371
01:07:41,743 --> 01:07:45,043
It wouldn't have stopped there.

1372
01:07:45,043 --> 01:07:47,876
Sikyung did a self-wedding photo shoot today.

1373
01:07:47,876 --> 01:07:51,176
I went to rent an outfit.

1374
01:07:51,176 --> 01:07:53,943
I tried it out and bought it.

1375
01:07:53,943 --> 01:07:56,543
I also bought some earrings. I wore earrings.

1376
01:07:56,543 --> 01:07:58,810
- No way. / - Why did you buy earrings?

1377
01:07:59,676 --> 01:08:04,410
I wanted to feel like Guam royalty.

1378
01:08:05,576 --> 01:08:08,543
I had a bowtie, an aloha shirt and earrings.

1379
01:08:08,910 --> 01:08:10,643
I wore the tuxedo...

1380
01:08:10,643 --> 01:08:12,076
I sweat so much as I was getting changed.

1381
01:08:12,076 --> 01:08:13,410
I couldn't take off my pants.

1382
01:08:13,410 --> 01:08:14,376
- It was stuck to you? / - Because of sweat.

1383
01:08:14,376 --> 01:08:15,710
I know what that is.

1384
01:08:15,710 --> 01:08:17,576
- But I had to cook for you. / - Yes.

1385
01:08:17,576 --> 01:08:20,243
There were products the viewers were curious about.

1386
01:08:20,243 --> 01:08:23,110
They wanted me to buy them and show it to them.

1387
01:08:23,110 --> 01:08:23,943
They wanted reviews.

1388
01:08:23,943 --> 01:08:27,143
We just need to try these and leave reviews.

1389
01:08:27,143 --> 01:08:28,810
Who wants to go first?

1390
01:08:28,810 --> 01:08:30,343
I see "kimchi" written in English.

1391
01:08:30,343 --> 01:08:32,443
It's kimchi flavored popcorn.

1392
01:08:32,443 --> 01:08:33,576
- What is that? / - We don't have it in Korea.

1393
01:08:33,576 --> 01:08:35,543
- Is this only in Guam? / - Yes, it's only in Guam.

1394
01:08:35,543 --> 01:08:36,743
What will it taste like?

1395
01:08:38,210 --> 01:08:40,043
Kimchi flavored popcorn?

1396
01:08:40,576 --> 01:08:42,876
It's so unusual.

1397
01:08:44,276 --> 01:08:46,343
It doesn't smell like kimchi.

1398
01:08:46,343 --> 01:08:47,543
Not at all.

1399
01:08:48,043 --> 01:08:50,076
1, 2, 3.

1400
01:08:52,843 --> 01:08:58,310
(This taste)

1401
01:08:59,143 --> 01:09:01,176
Isn't this just plain popcorn?

1402
01:09:03,643 --> 01:09:06,010
I think we should eat some kimchi with this.

1403
01:09:06,010 --> 01:09:08,110
Will you buy this or not

1404
01:09:08,110 --> 01:09:08,943
on your way to Korea?

1405
01:09:09,643 --> 01:09:12,576
1, 2, 3.

1406
01:09:12,576 --> 01:09:13,743
- I won't buy it. / - I won't buy it.

1407
01:09:14,576 --> 01:09:15,610
I won't.

1408
01:09:15,610 --> 01:09:17,643
I'm sorry. It's out.

1409
01:09:17,643 --> 01:09:19,976
This doesn't taste like Kimchi at all.

1410
01:09:19,976 --> 01:09:21,976
They just added a little spiciness.

1411
01:09:21,976 --> 01:09:23,976
I think it's a little spicy.

1412
01:09:23,976 --> 01:09:26,343
But it's not enough for us.

1413
01:09:26,343 --> 01:09:28,276
It might suit the taste of foreigners.

1414
01:09:29,276 --> 01:09:30,276
What's next?

1415
01:09:30,276 --> 01:09:33,676
There was so many dried fruits.

1416
01:09:34,010 --> 01:09:37,943
This is mango coated in dark chocolate.

1417
01:09:40,576 --> 01:09:41,243
Oh, my God.

1418
01:09:41,243 --> 01:09:42,743
This is my specialty.

1419
01:09:42,743 --> 01:09:45,176
Chocolate is for me.

1420
01:09:45,176 --> 01:09:48,543
- You said you wouldn't eat things like this. / - I'll buy it.

1421
01:09:51,410 --> 01:09:53,110
- You said you wouldn't eat things like this. / - I'll buy it.

1422
01:09:53,110 --> 01:09:55,676
(She hasn't had a taste yet)

1423
01:09:56,876 --> 01:09:59,910
You said you wouldn't eat it.

1424
01:09:59,910 --> 01:10:01,410
- I'll buy it. / - Try it first.

1425
01:10:01,410 --> 01:10:03,010
How can you not buy this when it looks like this?

1426
01:10:03,010 --> 01:10:05,010
You have to buy this if it looks like this.

1427
01:10:07,676 --> 01:10:08,776
Will you buy it?

1428
01:10:11,910 --> 01:10:14,243
It's a sweet thing covered in another sweet thing.

1429
01:10:15,510 --> 01:10:17,443
Doesn't it look so pretty?

1430
01:10:17,443 --> 01:10:18,643
How about the taste?

1431
01:10:18,643 --> 01:10:20,510
It doesn't taste like mangoes.

1432
01:10:20,510 --> 01:10:21,876
It doesn't taste like mangoes at all.

1433
01:10:21,876 --> 01:10:23,976
The chocolate is this thick.

1434
01:10:24,510 --> 01:10:25,743
You can't taste the mango.

1435
01:10:26,010 --> 01:10:27,643
Let's just eat a mango.

1436
01:10:27,643 --> 01:10:29,010
Plain mangoes are better.

1437
01:10:29,010 --> 01:10:29,943
- Plain mangoes are better. / - Yes.

1438
01:10:29,943 --> 01:10:31,676
Will you buy it or not? 1, 2, 3.

1439
01:10:31,676 --> 01:10:33,010
- I won't buy it. / - I won't buy it.

1440
01:10:33,010 --> 01:10:33,343
I'll buy it.

1441
01:10:33,343 --> 01:10:35,143
But the part without the chocolate is real good.

1442
01:10:35,143 --> 01:10:37,110
You have to buy this when it looks like this.

1443
01:10:38,376 --> 01:10:40,210
I think we still have a lot left to eat.

1444
01:10:40,210 --> 01:10:41,243
Do you have more left?

1445
01:10:42,010 --> 01:10:43,610
They said this was delicious.

1446
01:10:43,610 --> 01:10:44,610
Isn't this whipping cream?

1447
01:10:45,076 --> 01:10:46,076
This is...

1448
01:10:48,110 --> 01:10:49,043
I'll buy this.

1449
01:10:49,043 --> 01:10:51,076
(I'm the fairy of consumption)

1450
01:10:51,076 --> 01:10:52,210
You have to buy things like this.

1451
01:10:52,210 --> 01:10:54,310
Would you like American or sharp cheddar?

1452
01:10:54,310 --> 01:10:55,976
- I'll choose American. / - I'll also choose American.

1453
01:10:56,776 --> 01:10:58,410
This is like jelly.

1454
01:10:58,976 --> 01:11:00,643
This is amazing.

1455
01:11:01,143 --> 01:11:02,010
Can't you feel it?

1456
01:11:04,710 --> 01:11:06,943
This tastes like it will stick right to your veins.

1457
01:11:06,943 --> 01:11:08,076
I mean it.

1458
01:11:09,810 --> 01:11:11,376
It makes your tongue curl up.

1459
01:11:12,010 --> 01:11:14,010
It's because the crackers taste so strong.

1460
01:11:14,010 --> 01:11:15,443
This is good.

1461
01:11:15,443 --> 01:11:16,776
This is cheddar.

1462
01:11:16,776 --> 01:11:17,976
Let's try half each.

1463
01:11:20,176 --> 01:11:22,076
The cheese is good.

1464
01:11:23,576 --> 01:11:25,010
How do you eat this?

1465
01:11:25,543 --> 01:11:28,543
Foreigners dip chips in everything.

1466
01:11:28,810 --> 01:11:32,076
There are so many varieties of dipping.

1467
01:11:32,076 --> 01:11:34,176
They must have invented this after dipping everything.

1468
01:11:34,176 --> 01:11:38,376
Between the two, I recommend this one and I'd buy it.

1469
01:11:39,076 --> 01:11:40,876
- I won't buy this. / - I also won't buy this.

1470
01:11:41,776 --> 01:11:42,710
It's too salty.

1471
01:11:42,710 --> 01:11:44,910
I'll buy it if it looks pretty.

1472
01:11:45,376 --> 01:11:47,310
- We have one more left. / - What?

1473
01:11:47,310 --> 01:11:50,076
It's constipation medicine with chocolate flavor.

1474
01:11:50,076 --> 01:11:51,910
You can get it only in a drug section.

1475
01:11:51,910 --> 01:11:52,910
- Are you constipated? / - I'm not constipated.

1476
01:11:52,910 --> 01:11:53,443
Me neither.

1477
01:11:53,443 --> 01:11:55,343
I don't have constipation but should I try it?

1478
01:11:55,343 --> 01:11:57,043
- Just a taste? / - Just a slight taste.

1479
01:11:57,043 --> 01:11:59,810
It worked for one of our writers.

1480
01:11:59,810 --> 01:12:01,576
Really? Her constipation...

1481
01:12:01,576 --> 01:12:05,143
Gosh, what is that?

1482
01:12:05,543 --> 01:12:06,143
She was constipated?

1483
01:12:06,143 --> 01:12:08,210
Eat the whole thing. How much of it should I eat?

1484
01:12:08,210 --> 01:12:09,376
Read the instructions.

1485
01:12:09,376 --> 01:12:11,010
Is it chocolate?

1486
01:12:11,010 --> 01:12:12,643
It looks just like chocolate.

1487
01:12:12,643 --> 01:12:15,110
Two chocolate pieces for adults.

1488
01:12:15,110 --> 01:12:18,143
Once or twice a day.

1489
01:12:18,810 --> 01:12:20,310
It just smells like chocolate.

1490
01:12:20,876 --> 01:12:21,710
It really does.

1491
01:12:21,710 --> 01:12:23,643
- It's just chocolate. / - Let's taste it.

1492
01:12:25,343 --> 01:12:27,210
- It's a medicine, right? / - Yes.

1493
01:12:30,643 --> 01:12:32,076
I'll buy it.

1494
01:12:32,510 --> 01:12:34,243
It's a perfect gift.

1495
01:12:34,243 --> 01:12:37,443
- It's not so delicious though. / - It's not.

1496
01:12:37,443 --> 01:12:38,876
- It's a little bitter. / - It's bitter.

1497
01:12:38,876 --> 01:12:41,110
- But it's chocolate. / - Just chocolate.

1498
01:12:41,110 --> 01:12:42,910
If it really works, I'm willing to buy it.

1499
01:12:42,910 --> 01:12:44,643
- Me too. / - I'll buy it.

1500
01:12:44,643 --> 01:12:45,776
1, 2, 3.

1501
01:12:45,776 --> 01:12:46,410
- Buy it. / - I'll buy it.

1502
01:12:46,410 --> 01:12:47,343
It's great as a gift.

1503
01:12:47,343 --> 01:12:48,976
It's so good. How much is it?

1504
01:12:48,976 --> 01:12:49,476
Around $9.

1505
01:12:49,476 --> 01:12:51,043
- It's not cheap. / - $10?

1506
01:12:51,676 --> 01:12:54,043
There are 4 blocks though.

1507
01:12:55,043 --> 01:12:55,810
Chocolate...

1508
01:12:55,810 --> 01:12:57,776
So there are around 20 doses.

1509
01:12:58,843 --> 01:12:59,876
- Alright. / - This is unique.

1510
01:12:59,876 --> 01:13:01,876
This is very unique. It's interesting.

1511
01:13:01,876 --> 01:13:03,310
I'm willing to buy

1512
01:13:03,310 --> 01:13:04,510
more than half of the items.

1513
01:13:05,476 --> 01:13:11,543
(Guam shopping list)

1514
01:13:12,443 --> 01:13:15,976
And I got something when I had some time.

1515
01:13:15,976 --> 01:13:17,210
You went shopping.

1516
01:13:18,310 --> 01:13:19,576
You went shopping!

1517
01:13:20,010 --> 01:13:22,343
Take a closer look.

1518
01:13:23,243 --> 01:13:24,210
Nanda?

1519
01:13:26,176 --> 01:13:27,943
Nanda!

1520
01:13:30,443 --> 01:13:32,876
- Nanda. / - Hwijae! I love this.

1521
01:13:32,876 --> 01:13:34,710
I chose all the colors.

1522
01:13:34,710 --> 01:13:36,376
This is so pretty.

1523
01:13:38,276 --> 01:13:40,776
You can choose the color combinations

1524
01:13:40,776 --> 01:13:43,110
and make your own flip-flops.

1525
01:13:43,110 --> 01:13:44,443
This looks so pretty.

1526
01:13:44,810 --> 01:13:45,210
B.

1527
01:13:45,210 --> 01:13:48,876
(Hwijae's DIY gifts)

1528
01:13:49,610 --> 01:13:50,710
(Custom sandals, $30)

1529
01:13:50,710 --> 01:13:52,410
(Price may change depending on the design)

1530
01:13:53,110 --> 01:13:55,643
I chose all the colors.

1531
01:13:55,643 --> 01:13:57,543
This is so pretty.

1532
01:13:57,543 --> 01:13:59,676
- Something that doesn't stand out. / - Amazing.

1533
01:13:59,676 --> 01:14:01,110
Not to stand out.

1534
01:14:01,110 --> 01:14:03,776
Yellow and red doesn't stand out on women.

1535
01:14:03,776 --> 01:14:06,643
(She tries them on immediately)

1536
01:14:08,010 --> 01:14:09,743
- Don't expect too much. / - Of course.

1537
01:14:09,743 --> 01:14:11,143
Just...

1538
01:14:11,143 --> 01:14:13,243
- What's Sikyung's name? / - Something you can wear.

1539
01:14:13,243 --> 01:14:14,310
Does it say Sikyung?

1540
01:14:14,310 --> 01:14:15,943
- What's Sikyung's name? / - Something you can wear.

1541
01:14:15,943 --> 01:14:16,943
Does it say Sikyung?

1542
01:14:16,943 --> 01:14:18,543
No.

1543
01:14:20,210 --> 01:14:23,543
- What does it say? / - This looks like a designer label.

1544
01:14:24,710 --> 01:14:26,110
That's a fake.

1545
01:14:26,476 --> 01:14:29,710
- Balla? / - How can I wear this?

1546
01:14:29,710 --> 01:14:32,010
Just wear them at home.

1547
01:14:32,010 --> 01:14:33,876
- Thank you, Hwijae! / - Treasure it.

1548
01:14:34,510 --> 01:14:37,476
I think I'll have a good sleep tonight.

1549
01:14:37,476 --> 01:14:39,810
The air was so nice.

1550
01:14:39,810 --> 01:14:41,210
I felt really good.

1551
01:14:41,210 --> 01:14:43,043
It's been amazing. Thank you so much.

1552
01:14:44,643 --> 01:14:50,243
(They made great memories here)

1553
01:14:50,976 --> 01:14:53,710
(And)

1554

(They spent the past 2 years together)

1555
01:15:01,010 --> 01:15:02,376
How was the past 2 years?

1556
01:15:04,743 --> 01:15:07,510
- I didn't even know it's been 2 years. / - Me too.

1557
01:15:07,510 --> 01:15:09,410
I host other TV shows for longer...

- Time really flew for Battle Trip. / - You're right.

1559
01:15:11,810 --> 01:15:13,310
It's all thanks to the viewers

1560
01:15:13,310 --> 01:15:15,376
that show us lots of love.

1561
01:15:15,376 --> 01:15:16,843
I'm very grateful.

1562
01:15:17,976 --> 01:15:19,976
We've worked so hard to make

1563
01:15:19,976 --> 01:15:21,410
a meaningful and interesting show.

1564
01:15:21,410 --> 01:15:23,776
It's easy to say but difficult to achieve.

1565
01:15:23,776 --> 01:15:25,810
This isn't our last episode, is it?

1566
01:15:25,810 --> 01:15:26,976
- We will continue, right? / - We have too.

1567
01:15:26,976 --> 01:15:29,310
The new hosts will come from there.

1568
01:15:29,310 --> 01:15:31,010
Don't say that.

1569
01:15:31,010 --> 01:15:32,210
Three of them will come.

1570
01:15:32,210 --> 01:15:34,376
- Oh, so it's you? / - Who are they?

1571
01:15:34,376 --> 01:15:35,343
It's a junior.

1572
01:15:35,343 --> 01:15:37,476
Don't say that. I want to keep going.

1573
01:15:38,310 --> 01:15:40,176
It'd be so funny if three people walk in.

1574
01:15:41,276 --> 01:15:41,876
Right?

1575
01:15:41,876 --> 01:15:44,376

- So many good things are happening. / - Battle Trip?

1585
01:16:08,810 --> 01:16:12,810
How about we have an event to give away the book

1586
01:16:12,810 --> 01:16:13,643
as a gift to the viewers?

1587
01:16:13,643 --> 01:16:15,276
Yes, let's give them away.

??Spring, spring, spring is here ??

01:16:35,676 --> 01:16:37,143
It's like we're on a time travel.

1598
01:16:40,643 --> 01:16:41,843
No way.

1600
