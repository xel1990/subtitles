Everyone in Hawaii smiles all the time.

52
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,340
- No one ever frowned. / - It sounds scary.

53
00:01:57,340 --> 00:01:58,974
It will be scary if everyone is smiling.

54
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:02,174
They just say hi to everyone passing on the street.

55
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:04,440

I love that movie.

81
00:03:00,707 --> 00:03:02,474
I may sound like an old man

82
00:03:02,474 --> 00:03:04,640
but it's been less than a year since I watched it again.

83
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:05,774

Is it bigger than Korea?

119
00:04:22,107 --> 00:04:25,174

And the food is important.

124
00:04:34,807 --> 00:04:36,807
But I don't know anything about Austrian food.

125
00:04:36,807 --> 00:04:40,207
- They only have sausages / - Potatoes and sausages.

126
00:04:40,207 --> 00:04:41,407
Gangwon-do is famous for good potatoes.

128
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:44,607

- That's why. / - Yes.

136
00:04:58,607 --> 00:05:00,107
That's why people add Vienna in front of sausages.

137
00:05:00,107 --> 00:05:02,740
Yes, the sausages in Vienna became famous,

138
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:03,774
so the term, "Vienna sausage"

139
00:05:03,774 --> 00:05:05,574
turned into a kind of pronoun for sausages.

140
00:05:05,574 --> 00:05:07,407
- Did you have Vienna coffee? / - Vienna coffee.

141
00:05:07,407 --> 00:05:10,007

00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:39,607
Hello.

181
00:06:39,607 --> 00:06:41,140
I'm Seulgi from Red Velvet.

182
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:42,307
And I'm Wendy.

183
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:46,974
(Wendy, the main vocalist of Red Velvet)

184
00:06:48,107 --> 00:06:52,140
(Wendy is fluent in English)

185
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:55,440
Language is important. She speaks German too?

186
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:56,707
Seriously?

187
00:06:56,707 --> 00:06:57,874
(Overflowing excitement and swag)

188
00:06:57,874 --> 00:06:59,007
Let's go.

189
00:06:59,007 --> 00:07:00,407
She's full of excitement.

190
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,540
She's already bubbly.

191
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:04,307
(Off-the-wall and cheerful Wendy)

192
00:07:05,274 --> 00:07:07,440
(Seulgi, the main dancer of Red Velvet)

193
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,574
Seulgi is quite charismatic.

194
00:07:10,374 --> 00:07:12,640
(Off the stage, she's full of cute charm)

195
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:13,907
Let's go.

196
00:07:13,907 --> 00:07:16,140
No, no, please don't do that.

197
00:07:16,907 --> 00:07:20,674
(She eats and eats and it still tastes so good)

198
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,707
- I don't normally eat olives. / - You have to eat well.

199
00:07:22,707 --> 00:07:24,240
- You need to eat well. / - Exactly.

200
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,740
- Pig out when you can. / - You have to eat to win.

201
00:07:27,474 --> 00:07:29,607
The best countries to live in around the world.

202
00:07:29,607 --> 00:07:31,640
The best countries to live in around the world.

203
00:07:32,907 --> 00:07:34,374
I'm not sure.

204
00:07:35,307 --> 00:07:38,174
Let's try the best cities to live in around the world.

205
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:43,874
On here, it says Vienna is the best city to live in.

206
00:07:44,474 --> 00:07:45,774
- It's the best? / - Yes.

207
00:07:45,774 --> 00:07:46,774
- Oh, no. / - Seriously?

208
00:07:46,774 --> 00:07:48,874
Vienna is ranked 1st?

209
00:07:48,874 --> 00:07:50,607
That's the case when they are ranked by cities.

210
00:07:50,607 --> 00:07:53,807
- I see. / - Since it has the most students in Europe...

211
00:07:53,807 --> 00:07:56,107
The atmosphere is energetic and lively.

212
00:07:56,107 --> 00:07:58,307
Polices about housing, economy and environment

213
00:07:58,307 --> 00:08:00,040
are evenly developed in the city.

214
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:02,540
I've been wanting to visit Austria.

215
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:04,074
- And this city is ranked 1st. / - Okay.

216
00:08:04,074 --> 00:08:06,607
- Austria is amazing. / - Doesn't it suit the theme?

217
00:08:06,607 --> 00:08:09,040
Isn't that the movie you always go on about?

218
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:11,974
"Before Sunrise" was shot there.

219
00:08:11,974 --> 00:08:13,540
That's the city where the movie was set in.

220
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:14,907
- That was there? / - Yes.

221
00:08:14,907 --> 00:08:18,274
The country I really want to visit is Austria.

222
00:08:18,274 --> 00:08:19,774
What do you think?

223
00:08:20,307 --> 00:08:21,707
Anywhere in Europe is fine.

224
00:08:21,707 --> 00:08:22,774
It's fine?

225
00:08:22,774 --> 00:08:24,040
I'll be happy to go anywhere in Europe.

226
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,140
- Really? / - Yes.

227
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:27,507
- But we'll be tourists. / - Right.

228
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:29,474
Let's come up with a regular tourist's itinerary.

229
00:08:29,474 --> 00:08:30,874
Have you two traveled together?

230
00:08:30,874 --> 00:08:31,840
- We've never traveled together. / - Not once.

231
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,074
- This was your first time. / - Yes.

232
00:08:33,074 --> 00:08:37,574
There are Schonbrunn Palace and Belvedere Palace.

233
00:08:37,574 --> 00:08:39,340
It says that Belvedere Palace displays

234
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:41,007
an artwork by Klimt.

235
00:08:41,007 --> 00:08:42,474
It's a genuine piece.

236
00:08:42,474 --> 00:08:44,140
- It's genuine? / - Yes, it is.

237
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:45,707
We'll get to admire the piece with our bare eyes.

238
00:08:45,707 --> 00:08:46,507
What do you say?

239
00:08:46,507 --> 00:08:47,407
After visiting touristic places,

240
00:08:47,407 --> 00:08:49,574
we must become locals next.

241
00:08:50,407 --> 00:08:52,574
I'll guide you through the city just like a local.

242
00:08:52,574 --> 00:08:55,274
Since you'll prepare an itinerary for the famous places,

243
00:08:55,274 --> 00:08:58,340
I should find places where we can

244
00:08:58,340 --> 00:09:00,640
have a new experience.

245
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:03,040
This is the place I really wanted to visit.

246
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:05,740
(Seulgi personally plans the romantic trip in Vienna)

247
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:06,974
What's that?

248
00:09:07,174 --> 00:09:09,374
Goodness. This is amazing.

249
00:09:10,707 --> 00:09:12,240
I'm so happy right now.

250
00:09:12,807 --> 00:09:14,474
This is no joke.

251
00:09:14,474 --> 00:09:15,474
- Is it alright? / - Yes.

252
00:09:15,474 --> 00:09:16,774
- Is it good? / - Yes.

253
00:09:16,774 --> 00:09:18,440
I'd like to learn how to waltz.

254
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:19,074
The dance?

255
00:09:19,074 --> 00:09:21,507
(Learning waltz in the city of music)

256
00:09:21,507 --> 00:09:22,840
This is my first time too.

257
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:24,140
Since it was the first time for both of us,

258
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:25,440
it was an introductory class.

259
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,274
We just had a taste of what waltz is.

260
00:09:27,274 --> 00:09:28,607
This is the hidden spot I found.

261
00:09:28,607 --> 00:09:31,407
- Can't miss the night view. / - Yes, night view.

262
00:09:31,407 --> 00:09:32,640
Cheers.

263
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:36,874
The breeze makes the night perfect right now.

264
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:39,007
You can look forward to it.

265
00:09:39,574 --> 00:09:41,440
Today is my day.

266
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,940
(They leave to a small city for Wendy's Day)

267
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:45,707
- The colors are different. / - Europe is so nice.

268
00:09:45,707 --> 00:09:47,074
No way.

269
00:09:47,574 --> 00:09:49,074
- How beautiful. / - Small cities...

270
00:09:49,074 --> 00:09:50,574
Are charming in their own way.

271
00:09:50,574 --> 00:09:52,674
- Every alley is beautiful. / - It's over.

272
00:09:52,674 --> 00:09:53,607
- It's over. I'm telling you. / - It was really beautiful.

273
00:09:53,607 --> 00:09:55,207
- Game over. / - It's game over already.

274
00:09:55,207 --> 00:09:56,374
(They penetrate deep into the city)

275
00:09:56,574 --> 00:09:57,640
Your outfits look good on you.

276
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:59,240
They've transformed into Heidi.

277
00:09:59,574 --> 00:10:00,874
They're adorable.

278
00:10:00,874 --> 00:10:04,174
Just like "The Sound of Music."

279
00:10:04,174 --> 00:10:07,074
Everything is just perfect.

280
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:11,974
(Everything is bound to be perfect in Salzburg)

281
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:14,240
- Di. / - Gi.

282
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:16,074
- Di. / - Gi.

283
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:17,540
Dip!

284

(Seulgi's romantic Vienna, Wendy's classic Salzburg)

285
00:10:22,074 --> 00:10:23,207
(They finally set out to Austria)

286
00:10:23,207 --> 00:10:25,774
- Yes is "ja." / - Ja?

287
00:10:25,974 --> 00:10:27,940
- Ja. Nein. / - Nein.

288
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:30,340
- What about me? / - Here's what I found.

289
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:31,940
"Beer, please."

290
00:10:32,107 --> 00:10:35,040
(It's an important sentence)

291
00:10:36,507 --> 00:10:39,140
I'll entrust all the speaking to you on this trip.

292
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:40,940
No, my head is starting to hurt.

293
00:10:41,507 --> 00:10:44,507
- I'll be the guide in Vienna. / - Okay.

294
00:10:44,507 --> 00:10:46,407
We can listen to classical music there.

295
00:10:46,407 --> 00:10:49,040
Right. There's a painting by Klimt there.

296
00:10:50,407 --> 00:10:54,074
(Direct flight to Vienne takes 11 hours and 20 minutes)

297
00:10:54,074 --> 00:10:58,207
(Can stay for 90 days without visa)

298
00:10:58,840 --> 00:10:59,840
We've arrived.

299
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:00,974
Wow.

00:11:00,974 --> 00:11:03,774
- At last. / - At last, we've landed in Austria.

301
00:11:03,774 --> 00:11:05,807
- We're in Austria but... / - Digidigidip.

302
00:11:05,807 --> 00:11:08,640
Since it's late, let's go to our hotel...

303
00:11:08,807 --> 00:11:10,007
And rest.

304
00:11:10,007 --> 00:11:11,174
- Wendy. / - Seulgi.

305
00:11:11,174 --> 00:11:12,774
Digidigidip!

(Belvedere Palace with Klimt)

313
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:47,074
I know that you like Klimt.

314
00:11:47,074 --> 00:11:49,240
When there was a Klimt exhibit in Korea,

315
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:50,307
we were supposed to go together

316
00:11:50,307 --> 00:11:51,074
but you went without me.

317

- Do you remember? / - You didn't join me.

318
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,007
Do you remember?

319
00:11:54,007 --> 00:11:56,974
- I went to Klimt and... / - That's not important.

320
00:11:56,974 --> 00:11:58,240
We were supposed to go together

321
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,574
but you went without me. Remember?

322
00:12:00,074 --> 00:12:01,740
- I don't remember. / - You do, don't you?

323
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:02,807
You didn't come.

324
00:12:02,807 --> 00:12:04,140
No, I wanted to join you.

325
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:06,307
I had no idea that you were going there.

326
00:12:06,307 --> 00:12:08,574
Gosh, it's so pretty. Look. Can you take a photo?

327
00:12:08,574 --> 00:12:11,207
- The front gate looks magnificent. / - Right.

- I can't wait. / - Even from the start.

329
00:12:13,307 --> 00:12:14,574
The gate does look quite grand.

330
00:12:14,574 --> 00:12:15,307
It was so beautiful.

331
00:12:15,307 --> 00:12:17,007
It looks very inviting.

332
00:12:17,007 --> 00:12:20,474
- It has a face. / - I want to live in there, Seulgi.

333
00:12:20,474 --> 00:12:22,307
Me too. Let's ask if we can rent a room.

334
00:12:22,307 --> 00:12:23,640
Yes, let's do that.

335
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:26,674

336
00:12:26,674 --> 00:12:28,040
- You're right. / - Right.

337
00:12:29,807 --> 00:12:33,507
Hey. Hey, this looks magnificent.

338
00:12:36,907 --> 00:12:39,774
I heard that this palace is a summer house...

339
00:12:39,774 --> 00:12:42,207
- Of the royal family. / - Really?

340
00:12:42,474 --> 00:12:44,840
You must visit this palace when you go to Vienna.

341

Yes, it's a must.

(Klimt and Egon Schiele paintings are displayed)

344
00:12:50,307 --> 00:12:51,840
Historically, kings did reside in the palace, right?

345
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:53,140
- That's right. / - Yes.

346
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:55,574
There are more paintings than those.

356
00:13:20,074 --> 00:13:21,574
Let's hurry inside.

357
00:13:23,774 --> 00:13:25,207
Gosh, look at the chandelier.

358
00:13:25,207 --> 00:13:26,874
Look at the ceiling. Look.

359
00:13:27,574 --> 00:13:29,274
This is splendid.

360
00:13:30,907 --> 00:13:32,607
Hey, hey, hey.

361
00:13:32,607 --> 00:13:34,407
- Doesn't that look three-dimensional? / - Cute.

362
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,940
- That's a painting. / - Are you sure?

363
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:38,174
It's painted.

364
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:41,207
For the first time visitors, they all make that face.

365
00:13:41,574 --> 00:13:43,640
- You're right. / - It is, right? This is amazing.

366
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:46,474
This place is amazing. It looks three-dimensional.

367
00:13:46,474 --> 00:13:48,374
I don't know if you can see it on camera.

368
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:53,640
But seriously. When you... Gosh...

369
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:56,807
- They look like sculptures. / - Goodness. Gosh.

370
00:13:56,807 --> 00:13:58,174
You must visit.

371
00:13:59,007 --> 00:14:00,340
- They look three-dimensional. / - Right.

372
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:01,840
They do look like sculptures.

373
00:14:03,174 --> 00:14:04,574
(They set out to see other artworks)

374
00:14:04,574 --> 00:14:06,874
No, we have so much to see here.

375
00:14:11,674 --> 00:14:15,540
- These are all genuine. / - Yes.

376
00:14:15,874 --> 00:14:17,207
This is incredible.

377
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:19,707
- Hey. / - Amazing.

378
00:14:19,707 --> 00:14:21,974
- Hey, hey. This is it. / - This is the painting.

379
00:14:21,974 --> 00:14:24,807
- It's the famous painting. / - Is this authentic?

380
00:14:25,907 --> 00:14:29,240
I read that during this era, Klimt used gold

381
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:31,440
in a lot of his paintings.

382
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:32,940
Isn't she Klimt's muse?

383
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:34,707
- Yes, she is. / - That's right.

384
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:39,074
It's so intriguing that the colors haven't changed

385
00:14:39,074 --> 00:14:40,107
over time.

386
00:14:40,107 --> 00:14:41,940
This was painted a long time ago.

387
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:45,140
- Gustav Klimt. / - This is so cool.

388
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:53,740
How did he...

389
00:14:55,107 --> 00:14:57,440
- How will I treasure this? / - This is magnificent.

390
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:59,774
- The painting is keeping me here. / - Right.

391
00:14:59,774 --> 00:15:02,640
I don't think Wendy and Seulgi are old enough

392
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:03,540
to be impressed by such paintings.

393
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:06,440
That's what I thought too.

394
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:08,974
But when you see those paintings in person.

395
00:15:08,974 --> 00:15:10,307
When you see them in person,

396
00:15:10,307 --> 00:15:12,274
you can see how the texture is expressed.

397
00:15:12,274 --> 00:15:13,840
- That's right. / - That was fascinating.

398
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:16,974
- It feels different in person. / - The layers.

399
00:15:16,974 --> 00:15:18,174
This is just...

400
00:15:20,907 --> 00:15:21,940
This is it.

401
00:15:22,507 --> 00:15:24,640
I'll go and see it now.

402
00:15:25,574 --> 00:15:27,607
Gosh, this is so huge. I had no idea.

403
00:15:27,607 --> 00:15:29,674
- Gosh, seriously. / - It's very big in person.

404
00:15:29,674 --> 00:15:31,007
- Seriously. / - Right, right.

405
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:34,507
What painting is that?

406
00:15:34,574 --> 00:15:36,207
- It's "The Kiss." / - It's Gustav Klimt's...

407
00:15:36,207 --> 00:15:37,840
- "The Kiss." / - It's Klimt's "The Kiss."

408
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:43,007
That painting has never left Belvedere Palace.

409
00:15:43,574 --> 00:15:47,274
("The Kiss" by Gustav Klimt)

410
00:15:47,874 --> 00:15:51,574
(He used gold paints and real gold in this piece)

411
00:15:51,574 --> 00:15:55,074
(It conveys holiness, love and virtue)

412
00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:59,274
(They quietly take in the painting)

413
00:15:59,274 --> 00:16:00,574
I couldn't stop staring.

414
00:16:00,574 --> 00:16:02,474
- Does it captivate you? / - Yes.

415
00:16:02,474 --> 00:16:06,807
The difference of seeing a painting in person is

416
00:16:06,807 --> 00:16:08,507
when you see a printed version of it,

417
00:16:08,507 --> 00:16:10,074
you can't see the expressions.

418
00:16:10,074 --> 00:16:11,640
It looks flat.

419
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:13,274
But when you see it up close here,

420
00:16:13,274 --> 00:16:14,874
the brightness even varies.

421
00:16:14,874 --> 00:16:16,940
I can see how many layers he applied in this painting.

422
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:19,840
You can see the layers.

423
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:22,507
- That's true. / - Also, seeing it...

424
00:16:22,507 --> 00:16:25,674
Through the screen and in person feels very different.

425
00:16:25,674 --> 00:16:29,007
I understood why people go there to see it in person.

426
00:16:29,574 --> 00:16:32,574
- I could understand Seulgi. / - It looks so different.

427
00:16:32,574 --> 00:16:33,674
I'm really excited.

428
00:16:34,807 --> 00:16:36,674
This painting is pulling me in.

429
00:16:39,207 --> 00:16:41,474
- He used real gold for that. / - Right, right.

430
00:16:41,474 --> 00:16:44,207
I saw the piece in my early 30s.

431
00:16:44,207 --> 00:16:46,574
- The memory is still fresh in mind. / - Isn't it? Right?

432
00:16:46,574 --> 00:16:50,240
I bet even in your 40s, the memory will be fresh.

433
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:50,907
Definitely.

434
00:16:50,907 --> 00:16:53,240
There are many stories about the painting.

435
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:57,174
Some people say that they're not kissing.

436
00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:00,107
- He could be twisting her neck. / - Suffocating her.

437
00:17:00,107 --> 00:17:02,374
There are many stories about the painting.

438
00:17:02,374 --> 00:17:05,140
When you look closely, the woman's feet are

439
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:07,074
dangling from the cliff.

440
00:17:07,074 --> 00:17:09,107
(Her feet are dangling from the cliff)

441
00:17:09,107 --> 00:17:11,040
Next up is Egon Schiele.

442
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:12,774
- He greatly admired Klimt. / - Right, I know.

443
00:17:12,774 --> 00:17:16,540
That's why his early works are similar to Klimt.

444
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:19,040
- Later on, he found his style. / - He found his style.

445
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:21,474
His paintings are grimmer.

446
00:17:21,474 --> 00:17:25,740
He was quite fixated on death and sex.

447
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:26,974
There was debate about whether

448
00:17:26,974 --> 00:17:28,240
it was art or obscenity.

449
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:29,574
- This must be a completed artwork. / - Hi.

450
00:17:29,574 --> 00:17:31,240
- Hi. / - Are you Korean?

451
00:17:31,674 --> 00:17:34,407
(They are puzzled)

452
00:17:34,407 --> 00:17:35,707
- I see. / - Nice to meet you. Hi.

453
00:17:35,707 --> 00:17:38,240
- Nice to meet you. / - Hi, nice to meet you.

454
00:17:39,607 --> 00:17:41,974
(Did this stranger recognize Red Velvet?)

455
00:17:42,507 --> 00:17:45,307
How do you... Wait, so, you we're Red Velvet?

456
00:17:45,307 --> 00:17:46,407
- How do you know us? / - Yes, of course.

457
00:17:46,407 --> 00:17:48,507
I saw your videos on YouTube.

458
00:17:48,507 --> 00:17:50,507
We really met by chance.

459
00:17:50,507 --> 00:17:52,907
I saw your concert in North Korea.

460
00:17:53,174 --> 00:17:54,474
It was amazing.

461
00:17:55,507 --> 00:17:57,240
- He saw us perform in North Korea. / - Right. Yes.

462
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:58,740
- My gosh, you should... / - North Korea.

463
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:00,174
We were a bit flustered.

464
00:18:00,174 --> 00:18:02,407
Because a handsome foreign guy started talking to us.

465
00:18:02,407 --> 00:18:03,440
Exactly.

466
00:18:04,574 --> 00:18:08,007
Let's ask him to recommend a good restaurant.

467
00:18:08,007 --> 00:18:09,407
I thought you had a place in mind.

468
00:18:09,407 --> 00:18:11,940
I do. But something we must try from a local.

469
00:18:12,474 --> 00:18:15,374
If you're from here, is there any place that

470
00:18:15,374 --> 00:18:18,607
you can suggest that we should go to eat?

471
00:18:18,607 --> 00:18:21,107
- Yes, absolutely. / - Like for a restaurant?

472
00:18:21,107 --> 00:18:23,274
- You asked for a good place. / - Albertina.

473
00:18:23,274 --> 00:18:24,274
Bitzinger.

474
00:18:24,274 --> 00:18:25,807
Where you get like Austrian sausages

475
00:18:25,807 --> 00:18:27,174
or Austrian bread.

476
00:18:27,174 --> 00:18:28,540
It's one of the most amazing places.

477
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:29,774
Everyone goes there.

478
00:18:29,774 --> 00:18:31,674
- Okay, okay. / - Have a nice time in Vienna.

479
00:18:31,674 --> 00:18:32,840
- And enjoy your stay, okay? / - Thank you.

480
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:34,307
- Nice meeting you today. / - Thank you.

481
00:18:34,307 --> 00:18:36,340
- Thank you. / - Bye.

482
00:18:37,307 --> 00:18:39,840
- He's handsome. / - Yes. He's good-looking.

483
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:42,640
- He's hot. My heart pounded. / - He's handsome.

484
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:44,574
Is this like "Before Sunrise?"

485
00:18:44,574 --> 00:18:47,474
- No, no, no. / - "Before Sunrise" at the art gallery.

486
00:18:52,107 --> 00:18:55,174
(The landmark in the center of Vienna)

487
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:59,207
(This place is known as Vienna's soul)

488
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:01,740
(Tourist day in Vienna)

489
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:04,674
(St. Stephen's Cathedral)

490
00:19:04,674 --> 00:19:06,474
How will we get there?

491
00:19:06,474 --> 00:19:09,274
- We're going to get there by tram. / - Okay.

492
00:19:09,274 --> 00:19:13,574
When we get there, we just need the Vienna City Card.

493
00:19:13,574 --> 00:19:15,707
You can get the physical tickets.

494
00:19:15,707 --> 00:19:17,474
- Or the mobile pass? / - Yes.

495
00:19:17,474 --> 00:19:18,940
Just show the QR code and barcode.

496
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:19,740
Vienna City Card?

497
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:21,140
- Yes. / - We can use it anywhere.

498
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:23,907
I didn't have that when I was there. What is that?

499
00:19:23,907 --> 00:19:26,440
When you went there, were smart phones invented?

500
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:28,407
I brought a huge cell phone as big as this with me.

501
00:19:28,407 --> 00:19:30,340
But they don't check the ticket on trams.

502
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:31,574
- Right. / - They don't.

503
00:19:31,574 --> 00:19:33,907
- But on rare occasions... / - The fine is 50 times.

504
00:19:33,907 --> 00:19:36,540
- The Vienna City Card for 48 hours... / - Yes?

505
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:39,607
Costs $28. And each tram ticket costs $2.80.

506
00:19:39,607 --> 00:19:41,640
That's why tourists often carry around that card.

507
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:43,507
- That's a good tip. / - Right. They do.

508
00:19:44,174 --> 00:19:46,907
The streets are so pretty. Look at the trees.

509
00:19:47,274 --> 00:19:49,774
Here and there, I see newly-built buildings.

510
00:19:49,774 --> 00:19:51,740
- I see. / - There are some new buildings.

511
00:19:51,907 --> 00:19:54,907
And old buildings are mixed among them too.

512
00:19:55,074 --> 00:19:56,974
- But I really like it. / - I do too.

513
00:19:56,974 --> 00:19:58,907
The sun isn't scorching.

514
00:19:59,474 --> 00:20:01,574
The sun is warmly embracing me.

515
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:05,274
Now that you're here, you've become sentimental.

516
00:20:05,274 --> 00:20:08,674
No. I'm becoming sentimental now.

517
00:20:09,007 --> 00:20:10,640
Being sentimental is good.

518
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:15,807
(The very scenery makes them feel sentimental)

519
00:20:15,807 --> 00:20:20,274
(They try to treasure everything in their eyes)

520
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:24,774
(Where have they arrived by tram?)

521
00:20:25,207 --> 00:20:27,274
All the tourist attractions are nearby.

522
00:20:27,274 --> 00:20:29,474
(Carinthian Street)

523
00:20:29,474 --> 00:20:31,140
- The city center was great there. / - Seriously.

524
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:33,374
- It's really good. / - It's paradise for shoppers.

525
00:20:33,374 --> 00:20:35,940
- That's right. / - Is it similar to Myeong-dong?

526
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:37,707
- I did shop there. / - That's right.

527
00:20:37,707 --> 00:20:40,840
- We looked around. / - Just sitting there would be nice.

528
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:43,474
- Right. / - It's beautiful just to walk around.

529
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:45,774
This reminds me of Myeong-dong.

530
00:20:46,207 --> 00:20:47,474
This is like a new town.

531
00:20:50,507 --> 00:20:53,607
(It takes about 10 minutes on foot)

532
00:20:53,774 --> 00:20:56,040
When we turn the corner...

533
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:58,040
- We'll arrive at the cathedral. / - Really?

534
00:20:58,707 --> 00:21:00,607
Hurry, hurry. I want to look at it now.

535
00:21:02,174 --> 00:21:04,107
(This is amazing)

536
00:21:04,107 --> 00:21:06,940
- They're so responsive. / - This is splendid.

537
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:10,040
Gosh, I can't believe this.

538
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:12,874
It looks so cool.

539
00:21:13,807 --> 00:21:15,740
- It looks amazing. / - It looks magnificent.

540
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:17,340
How did they build this?

541
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:19,274
Sculpting each of those pieces...

542
00:21:21,174 --> 00:21:25,740
(800-year-old St. Stephen's Cathedral)

543
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:29,407
(39m high ceilings, the tower stands at 137m)

544
00:21:29,407 --> 00:21:32,307
(It's the best Gothic architecture in Austria)

545
00:21:32,307 --> 00:21:35,707
(Impressive mosaics roof made of blue and gold bricks)

546
00:21:35,707 --> 00:21:39,107
Mozart's wedding and funeral were held there.

547
00:21:39,974 --> 00:21:41,174
His tomb is kept under there.

548
00:21:41,174 --> 00:21:42,840
- Yes, I heard he's buried there. / - Really?

549
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:44,807
- His tomb is kept there. / - That's true.

550
00:21:47,074 --> 00:21:49,607
(They're mesmerized at the same time)

551
00:21:49,607 --> 00:21:50,840
What is that?

552
00:21:53,307 --> 00:21:55,374
(The side view gives off a different vibe)

553
00:21:55,374 --> 00:21:57,607
European cathedrals are fascinating. Up so high...

554
00:21:57,607 --> 00:21:59,140
- You're right. / - How did they build that?

555
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:00,874
- Exactly. / - It's amazing.

556
00:22:00,874 --> 00:22:02,940
- Those small decorations... / - Exactly.

557
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:04,974
- I bet they went up there. / - They're really exquisite.

558
00:22:04,974 --> 00:22:07,040
I figured out why it looks different.

559
00:22:07,507 --> 00:22:10,740
They didn't finish building in the same era.

560
00:22:11,674 --> 00:22:13,074
It was destroyed in a fire.

561
00:22:13,074 --> 00:22:16,107
So they had to start from scratch to build it.

562
00:22:16,107 --> 00:22:19,440
The cathedral was built over a long period of time.

563
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:20,807
That's why it looks different.

564
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:24,840
That's why it feels different from different angles.

565
00:22:25,007 --> 00:22:27,174
When you look at the cathedral, you feel solemn.

566
00:22:27,174 --> 00:22:28,207
Yes, that does happen.

567
00:22:28,207 --> 00:22:29,474
When you go up the tower,

568
00:22:29,474 --> 00:22:31,274
you can see the view of the city.

569
00:22:32,007 --> 00:22:34,674
- Photos won't do the justice. / - No, they won't.

570
00:22:34,674 --> 00:22:36,040
It's not possible at all.

571
00:22:36,707 --> 00:22:38,874
This is beautiful.

572
00:22:42,607 --> 00:22:46,274
(Trying her best to capture the beauty)

573
00:22:46,774 --> 00:22:48,740
This is beautiful. It's so pretty. What do we do?

574
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:51,240
What a shame. I have to engrave it in my memory.

575
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:52,540
Give up on photos.

576
00:22:53,874 --> 00:22:57,007
(Too big to capture on camera)

577
00:22:57,007 --> 00:22:58,107
To take a proper photo,

578
00:22:58,107 --> 00:22:59,240
one of you has to lie down on the street.

579
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:01,674
- Right? / - We can't capture the whole thing.

580
00:23:01,674 --> 00:23:03,174
- I'm serious. / - Yes, it's hard.

581
00:23:04,507 --> 00:23:06,507
Now, they're going to the market.

582
00:23:06,507 --> 00:23:07,440
I really like the market.

583
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:09,574
Exactly. You need to visit the markets.

584
00:23:10,407 --> 00:23:11,574
(Naschmarkt)

585
00:23:11,574 --> 00:23:12,974
(Largest produce, meat and cheese market)

586
00:23:12,974 --> 00:23:14,140
See? That looks delicious.

587
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:16,907
- That's from that market? / - Their cheese is famous.

588
00:23:16,907 --> 00:23:19,674
- Right. There was a lot of cheese. / - There was a lot.

589
00:23:19,674 --> 00:23:22,140
- Can you buy snacks from there? / - I'm getting hungry.

590
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:23,507
- That's Naschmarkt? / - Yes, yes.

591
00:23:23,507 --> 00:23:25,574
- It's Naschmarkt. / - That's really good.

592
00:23:25,574 --> 00:23:26,774
It seems like it.

593
00:23:27,507 --> 00:23:30,474
Apparently, this market overflows with a lot of food.

594
00:23:30,474 --> 00:23:32,140
- Fruits? / - That's right.

595
00:23:32,374 --> 00:23:34,007
This market is called Naschmarkt.

596
00:23:34,007 --> 00:23:36,240
I looked this up because we were coming here.

597
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:38,740
We diligently prepared for this.

598
00:23:39,274 --> 00:23:41,207
Let's try it. Let's say that something is expensive.

599
00:23:41,207 --> 00:23:43,574
We might have to lower the price. It's too expensive.

600
00:23:43,574 --> 00:23:45,874
- "Gosh, it's too expensive." / - "It's too expensive."

601
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:48,307
(Outstanding German skills)

602
00:23:48,774 --> 00:23:50,040
I think she's good.

603
00:23:51,174 --> 00:23:52,707
(Acting fussy is essential)

604
00:23:52,707 --> 00:23:55,240
- What's next? Extra food. / - "Give us some extra."

605
00:23:56,707 --> 00:23:58,274
Wait, let me try that again.

606
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:03,240
(Give us some extra food)

607
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:05,607
- Do you have to make that face? / - She's good.

608
00:24:05,607 --> 00:24:06,707
- Just like this. / - Okay, okay.

609
00:24:06,707 --> 00:24:08,240
They might raise the prices here.

610
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:09,707
Yes. We always have to be careful.

611
00:24:09,707 --> 00:24:11,074
You might be pick-pocketed here.

612
00:24:11,074 --> 00:24:12,574
That's why I put my bag in front.

613
00:24:12,574 --> 00:24:14,607
- I covered it with my jacket. / - Wear it in front?

614
00:24:14,607 --> 00:24:17,574
- Let's be careful. / - It's been there for 120 years.

615
00:24:18,107 --> 00:24:19,007
It's an old market.

616
00:24:19,007 --> 00:24:20,707
On this street, they sell groceries.

617
00:24:20,707 --> 00:24:22,640
Restaurants are on the next street.

618
00:24:23,274 --> 00:24:24,807
Please eat something.

619
00:24:25,207 --> 00:24:27,274
- Yes, eat something. / - I really want to go there.

620
00:24:27,274 --> 00:24:29,307
- Let's eat something. / - This must be the place.

621
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:32,574
The fruits on the side...

622
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:34,574
- The fruits and vegetables... / - They're huge.

623
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:36,607
Wendy, you must've been happy since you like fruit.

624
00:24:36,607 --> 00:24:39,240
I was so happy. I really like fruit.

625
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:40,407
You should've emptied the place.

626
00:24:40,407 --> 00:24:41,940
I wanted to buy everything there.

627
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:43,940
What's up with those?

628
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:45,707
It looks like it's been wronged.

629
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:48,174
- Do flat peaches taste different? / - Yes.

630
00:24:48,174 --> 00:24:49,807
- They aren't juicy. / - Right.

631
00:24:49,807 --> 00:24:50,940
- It's not runny. / - They aren't juicy.

632
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:52,174
- It's not runny? / - No.

633
00:24:52,174 --> 00:24:54,174
You can eat it clean.

634
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:56,607
(She's calling the merchant to buy fruit)

635
00:24:56,607 --> 00:24:59,040
(Now what?)

636
00:24:59,207 --> 00:25:00,307
Tell him.

637
00:25:00,307 --> 00:25:01,440
Excuse me.

638
00:25:01,774 --> 00:25:04,740
Can I have 1kg of this?

639
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:05,974
- 1kg? / - Yes.

640
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:07,140
Please.

641
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:08,940
I'll try saying this. "Give me extra."

642
00:25:10,274 --> 00:25:13,040
(She practiced saying "Give me extra" in German)

643
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:16,074
- Do you have to make that face? / - Extra, please.

644
00:25:16,774 --> 00:25:18,840
- She's going to do it. / - She has to do it now.

645
00:25:20,140 --> 00:25:21,840
(Here comes the target)

646
00:25:22,374 --> 00:25:24,274
(She carefully says the phrase)

647
00:25:24,274 --> 00:25:27,374
(Give me some extra)

648
00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:30,707
(Enigmatic smile)

649
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:32,107
Finish?

650
00:25:32,107 --> 00:25:33,674
- He's scary. / - It's over.

651
00:25:33,674 --> 00:25:35,440
- He didn't understand. / - Oh, goodness.

652
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:36,940
- It's hard. / - Poor Wendy.

653
00:25:36,940 --> 00:25:38,374
- It's done. / - Is this the end?

654
00:25:40,374 --> 00:25:41,707
But I did it.

655
00:25:41,707 --> 00:25:43,607
- It's done. / - 1kg?

656
00:25:45,107 --> 00:25:46,640
He pretended not to hear you.

657
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:48,107
He pretended not to hear it.

658
00:25:49,307 --> 00:25:51,074
- Thank you. / - Thank you very much.

659
00:25:51,074 --> 00:25:53,440
(They bought the fruit but Wendy is upset)

660
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:54,940
Green grapes!

661
00:25:55,707 --> 00:25:59,540
(They decide to wash the peach and eat it right away)

662
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:03,407
Will it get dirty because of your hands?

663
00:26:03,407 --> 00:26:05,040
No way.

664
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:06,340
I'm cleaning it thoroughly.

665
00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:08,040
It won't taste salty, will it?

666
00:26:08,107 --> 00:26:10,307
I'm cleaning it thoroughly.

667
00:26:11,174 --> 00:26:18,374
(It's finally time to eat the flat peach)

668
00:26:18,374 --> 00:26:21,174
- I want to try it. / - It's not too sweet.

669
00:26:21,174 --> 00:26:22,740
It's sweet enough.

670
00:26:23,307 --> 00:26:26,874
(Finally, Seulgi takes a bite)

671
00:26:27,574 --> 00:26:29,740
- It looks really sweet. Is it okay? / - Yes.

672
00:26:29,740 --> 00:26:31,107
- Is it good? / - Yes.

673
00:26:31,540 --> 00:26:32,640
It's not sour.

674
00:26:33,607 --> 00:26:35,940
First, the peach smell is perfect.

675
00:26:36,740 --> 00:26:37,874
I'll try it.

676
00:26:39,507 --> 00:26:42,340
Usually, the skin is astringent but this isn't.

677
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:45,574
Isn't it good?

678
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:50,607
The flavor and the fragrance are really strong.

679
00:26:50,740 --> 00:26:51,940
- Yes. / - Isn't it?

680
00:26:52,307 --> 00:26:54,807
It's like juice.

681
00:26:55,007 --> 00:26:57,940
Do you know what it's like to eat a Korean peach?

682
00:26:58,174 --> 00:26:59,207
The juice goes all the way down here.

683
00:26:59,207 --> 00:27:02,474
I know. They drip like this.

684
00:27:03,507 --> 00:27:05,507
When I'm cutting it, the juice drips.

685
00:27:05,974 --> 00:27:07,740
Seriously, this isn't like that.

686
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:09,574
- Also, it's easy to eat. / - Yes.

687
00:27:09,740 --> 00:27:11,240
Maybe because it's flat.

688
00:27:11,607 --> 00:27:12,607
Also...

689
00:27:13,107 --> 00:27:14,474
It's not too hard...

690
00:27:15,074 --> 00:27:16,774
- Nor too soft. / - It's not too soft.

691
00:27:17,774 --> 00:27:19,407
- It's just right. / - It's not easy...

692
00:27:19,407 --> 00:27:22,340
To make your mouth water with fruit.

693
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:23,640
I really want to try it.

694
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:26,374
- I really love peaches. / - Me too.

695
00:27:26,374 --> 00:27:28,407
They're holding the peach like a dumpling.

696
00:27:28,407 --> 00:27:32,040
- It's easy to eat. / - Right.

697
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:33,474
It's easy to throw away too.

698
00:27:33,474 --> 00:27:36,707
All you're eating in Austria is peach.

699
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:39,207
But you must try the flat peach.

700
00:27:39,474 --> 00:27:40,307
It's a summer fruit,

701
00:27:40,307 --> 00:27:42,074
so you can start having from mid-June.

702
00:27:42,074 --> 00:27:46,174
It's in season in July and August, during hot summer.

703
00:27:46,174 --> 00:27:47,574
It's in season now.

704
00:27:48,374 --> 00:27:50,640
If you aren't allergic, you must try it.

705
00:27:52,707 --> 00:27:56,274
Since we're here, shouldn't we feel it?

706
00:27:56,274 --> 00:27:57,974
- Feel what? / - Europe.

707
00:27:58,274 --> 00:27:59,874
I'm feeling this flat peach right now.

708
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:02,974
Why don't we sit down here

709
00:28:02,974 --> 00:28:04,374
and order something?

710
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:06,307
I want to eat this.

711
00:28:06,574 --> 00:28:07,674
Shrimp?

712
00:28:07,707 --> 00:28:08,974
Yes, that's delicious.

713
00:28:08,974 --> 00:28:10,540
- Yes. / - You have to try that in a market.

714
00:28:10,540 --> 00:28:11,807
Seafood.

715
00:28:11,807 --> 00:28:14,174
- They have white wine. / - Okay.

716
00:28:14,407 --> 00:28:16,240
- Let's order wine too. / - Okay.

717
00:28:16,474 --> 00:28:17,740
Try it.

718
00:28:19,007 --> 00:28:19,940
Sure. What is this?

719
00:28:20,107 --> 00:28:21,740
Olive chili.

720
00:28:22,007 --> 00:28:23,707
- Spicy? / - Spicy, yes.

721
00:28:23,707 --> 00:28:25,707
- A lot? / - Yes.

722
00:28:25,707 --> 00:28:26,374
Hot.

723
00:28:26,374 --> 00:28:27,507
Really hot?

724
00:28:27,507 --> 00:28:28,740
Hot lady, hot olive.

725
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:30,407
- I think it's spicy. / - Try it.

726
00:28:32,274 --> 00:28:34,207
Is that chili inside?

727
00:28:39,540 --> 00:28:40,807
It's a different kind of spiciness

728
00:28:40,807 --> 00:28:41,540
compared to Korean chili.

729
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:42,074
Is it?

730
00:28:42,074 --> 00:28:44,874
- It's really spicy. / - Your tongue...

731
00:28:44,874 --> 00:28:47,240
- Hurts. / - It has a sharp taste.

732
00:28:48,540 --> 00:28:49,674
Is it spicy?

733
00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:53,640
You're lost for words.

734
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:55,540
Your tongue will be on fire.

735
00:28:56,074 --> 00:28:58,007
(She's trying to cool it with wine)

736
00:28:58,007 --> 00:28:59,240
Cheers.

737
00:29:00,174 --> 00:29:01,540
There's no time for that.

738
00:29:02,174 --> 00:29:04,274
- It's too spicy. / - It's too hot.

739
00:29:04,274 --> 00:29:06,407
- That's wine. / - Is it still spicy?

740
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:10,607
(Gulping)

741
00:29:10,607 --> 00:29:12,374
Don't drink it like it's water.

742
00:29:12,374 --> 00:29:14,174
(I can't help it)

743
00:29:14,407 --> 00:29:15,840
Is it that spicy?

744
00:29:17,540 --> 00:29:22,674
(Seulgi gets curious)

745
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:25,007
(She gives it a try)

746
00:29:29,507 --> 00:29:30,974
What kind of cheese is this?

747
00:29:30,974 --> 00:29:33,107
- Truffle. / - Truffle cheese?

748
00:29:37,674 --> 00:29:38,740
It's spicy.

749
00:29:41,574 --> 00:29:43,174
(Sterbe)

750
00:29:43,607 --> 00:29:45,340
(No)

751
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:48,207
(Ich sterbe)

752
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:49,707
What does that mean?

753
00:29:49,707 --> 00:29:50,807
"I'm dying."

754
00:29:51,140 --> 00:29:52,307
Because it's too spicy.

755
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:55,440
Let's eat the shrimp.

756
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:57,140
($11.40 per platter)

757
00:29:57,540 --> 00:29:58,707
Wait.

758
00:30:02,140 --> 00:30:03,274
What's this?

759
00:30:03,540 --> 00:30:04,574
Isn't this shrimp?

760
00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:06,574
It's kind of...

761
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:09,374
I think it's fishcake.

762
00:30:11,174 --> 00:30:13,474
- Isn't it shrimp? / - I thought it was shrimp.

763
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:16,807
(Still, it's delicious)

764
00:30:19,974 --> 00:30:22,807
I didn't think I'd drink wine

765
00:30:22,807 --> 00:30:24,674
in a traditional market.

766
00:30:24,907 --> 00:30:26,974
That's really interesting.

767
00:30:27,274 --> 00:30:29,074
It's a new experience for me.

768
00:30:29,407 --> 00:30:31,540
I guess it's common to sell wine

769
00:30:31,540 --> 00:30:33,407
at the market in Europe.

770
00:30:33,407 --> 00:30:35,740
- I wanted to try this. / - Me too.

771
00:30:37,107 --> 00:30:39,140
It's not cheap.

772
00:30:39,140 --> 00:30:41,774
- What will you have for dinner? / - They're finally eating.

773
00:30:42,374 --> 00:30:43,340
- I'm curious. / - Me too.

774
00:30:43,340 --> 00:30:45,107
- We have to go quickly. / - It was so good.

775
00:30:45,107 --> 00:30:47,807
- What do they sell? / - This is a very famous place.

776
00:30:47,807 --> 00:30:50,040
- So what do they sell? / - It's a secret.

777
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:52,174
- What is it? Tell me. / - You'll be surprised.

778
00:30:52,174 --> 00:30:53,474
It's this big.

779
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:55,740
- This big. / - That's cute.

780
00:30:57,774 --> 00:31:02,374
(It gets grilled in charcoal)

781
00:31:02,807 --> 00:31:04,674
- Goodness. / - That's it.

782
00:31:04,674 --> 00:31:06,174
- It's game over. / - Seriously.

783
00:31:06,174 --> 00:31:08,374
- Look at the meat. / - That's like the final blow.

784
00:31:08,374 --> 00:31:09,674
Goodness. What's that?

785
00:31:09,674 --> 00:31:11,140
Poor Canadian ribs.

786
00:31:11,140 --> 00:31:13,807
That's cooked on a charcoal grill.

787
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:19,040
(The rib arrives)

788
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:21,807
I could drink 8 bottles of beer with that.

789
00:31:22,907 --> 00:31:24,307
Right?

790
00:31:24,307 --> 00:31:26,207
You don't need sauce because the meat is so good.

791
00:31:26,207 --> 00:31:27,507
- No need for sauce. / - No.

792
00:31:27,507 --> 00:31:29,607
The meat itself is so delicious.

793
00:31:30,274 --> 00:31:33,040
I'll have to eat ribs tonight.

794
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:34,474
Look at how thick it is.

795
00:31:34,474 --> 00:31:35,274
Look how thick that is.

796
00:31:35,274 --> 00:31:37,874
- Wow. / - I have to take pictures.

797
00:31:37,874 --> 00:31:39,107
It smells...

798
00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:40,640
How does it smell?

799
00:31:41,707 --> 00:31:43,740
- It's like a barbecue in the yard. / - You're right.

800
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:45,540
Like having a barbecue at a place like this.

801
00:31:45,540 --> 00:31:47,507
Yes, like the barbecue smell from the next door.

802
00:31:47,507 --> 00:31:50,540
Grilling pork in charcoal makes it juicier.

803
00:31:50,540 --> 00:31:54,240
In Korea, we eat...

804
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:56,707
- Mostly carbohydrates with sodium. / - Right.

805
00:31:56,707 --> 00:31:58,140
We eat stew and rice.

806
00:31:58,140 --> 00:31:59,440
If you eat meat there,

807
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:01,140
you'd think, "This is what meat really tastes like."

808
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:02,374
I want to try it.

809
00:32:02,374 --> 00:32:04,940
- Shall we eat it? / - We'll eat the rib now.

810
00:32:05,207 --> 00:32:07,807
(Seulgi doesn't know what to do)

811
00:32:08,874 --> 00:32:11,307
I haven't eaten ribs much before.

812
00:32:11,307 --> 00:32:12,474
Don't make it obvious.

813
00:32:12,907 --> 00:32:14,807
- Just eat it. / - How should I eat it?

814
00:32:14,807 --> 00:32:15,940
Just like this.

815
00:32:16,107 --> 00:32:17,307
- There's the bone. / - Yes.

816
00:32:17,307 --> 00:32:20,407
- Do I cut it? / - I love cutting the meat.

817
00:32:20,407 --> 00:32:22,207
Do I cut it like this and eat it?

818
00:32:23,907 --> 00:32:25,440
- Oh, wow. / - My goodness.

819
00:32:25,940 --> 00:32:27,707
That with soju... I mean...

820
00:32:28,874 --> 00:32:30,207
Soju would go well with it.

821
00:32:30,207 --> 00:32:31,474
Because it's grilled on charcoal.

822
00:32:31,774 --> 00:32:33,007
How was it?

823
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:34,774
This was...

824
00:32:34,774 --> 00:32:37,107
- The smoky flavor was so good. / - This scent.

825
00:32:42,474 --> 00:32:43,574
It's tender.

826
00:32:44,074 --> 00:32:46,140
I understand why the locals love it.

827
00:32:46,274 --> 00:32:50,240
It deserves to be loved by everyone.

828
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:51,874
Austrians...

829
00:32:52,274 --> 00:32:53,907
Really enjoy eating ribs.

830
00:32:54,574 --> 00:32:57,040
So there are a lot of famous rib restaurants.

831
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:59,440
- The real charcoal flavor. / - Charcoal flavor.

832
00:33:00,007 --> 00:33:02,140
I can feel that. I think that's really good.

833
00:33:02,407 --> 00:33:04,307
It's just salt and black pepper.

834
00:33:04,307 --> 00:33:06,174
So it's not too greasy.

835
00:33:06,174 --> 00:33:09,440
- Koreans would like it. / - Right.

836
00:33:10,974 --> 00:33:12,707
Also, it's...

837
00:33:13,907 --> 00:33:15,074
Very juicy.

838
00:33:15,074 --> 00:33:17,040
That doesn't mean it's greasy though.

839
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:18,474
Right. It's light.

840
00:33:20,674 --> 00:33:22,940
It's not greasy. It's chewy.

841
00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:24,374
I love the chewy texture.

842
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:26,274
What was the sauce? Garlic?

843
00:33:26,274 --> 00:33:27,707
- Garlic sauce. / - This one is Western sauce.

844
00:33:27,707 --> 00:33:29,607
- They give you sauce on the side. / - You must dip.

845
00:33:29,607 --> 00:33:31,174
- You need variations. / - What's Western sauce?

846
00:33:31,174 --> 00:33:33,774
(Seulgi tries the garlic sauce first)

847
00:33:34,107 --> 00:33:35,407
This is garlic sauce.

848
00:33:35,474 --> 00:33:37,174
(She licks the sauce)

849
00:33:37,174 --> 00:33:38,274
Gosh, this is...

850
00:33:41,774 --> 00:33:42,874
Gosh, this is...

851
00:33:43,007 --> 00:33:45,107
It's better with this sauce.

852
00:33:45,507 --> 00:33:48,840
(Let me try)

853
00:33:49,874 --> 00:33:53,507
It's like the garlic dipping sauce for pizza.

854
00:33:53,507 --> 00:33:54,274
It tastes just like that.

855
00:33:54,274 --> 00:33:55,874
But I don't like garlic sauce.

856
00:33:56,474 --> 00:33:57,774
- Because it's greasy. / - Yes.

857
00:33:58,074 --> 00:34:02,140
This isn't greasy, so I think it's okay.

858
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:03,474
Should I try this?

859
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:08,807
(Now, they try the Western sauce)

860
00:34:10,140 --> 00:34:11,840
What is Western sauce?

861
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:13,307
Western sauce is...

862
00:34:13,807 --> 00:34:15,140
It tastes like sauce from the Middle East.

863
00:34:15,140 --> 00:34:16,740
It's like Western version of our red chili paste.

864
00:34:16,740 --> 00:34:17,540
That's right.

865
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:23,907
It's a bit like red chili paste with vinegar.

866
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:27,707
I actually thought it was for a moment.

867
00:34:28,140 --> 00:34:30,840
- It's that mixed with ketchup. / - Yes, ketchup.

868
00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:32,507
I like Western sauce better.

869
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:34,374
- You like that more? / - Yes.

870
00:34:34,374 --> 00:34:36,540
This one is good too. I like them both.

871
00:34:36,674 --> 00:34:40,107
I usually don't dip my pizza or chicken in sauce.

872
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:42,340
But this is good.

873
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:46,407
Dipping in sauce is good but it's also tasty without it.

874
00:34:46,407 --> 00:34:48,507
Then you should just eat it without the sauce.

875
00:34:48,507 --> 00:34:50,840
No matter how you eat it, it's delicious.

876
00:34:50,874 --> 00:34:52,307
I'm so hungry.

877
00:34:57,007 --> 00:35:03,174
(The ribs are so delicious)

878
00:35:03,340 --> 00:35:06,607
One rack of ribs was $25.

879
00:35:06,607 --> 00:35:08,040
- It's cheap. / - It's not different from Canada.

880
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:11,207
People there love ribs so much.

881
00:35:11,207 --> 00:35:14,474
- It's one rack per person. / - An entire rack.

882
00:35:14,974 --> 00:35:16,774
They must ask for a full rack.

883
00:35:17,074 --> 00:35:19,274
Now that we've had food,

884
00:35:19,274 --> 00:35:21,107
we're going to go to the next spot.

885
00:35:21,207 --> 00:35:23,074
- Where? / - You'll love it.

886
00:35:23,307 --> 00:35:25,574
This is where I really wanted to go.

887
00:35:25,574 --> 00:35:28,107
It's the place that was on "Before Sunrise."

888
00:35:28,107 --> 00:35:29,440
That's all I can tell you now.

889
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:31,707
I don't want to go there with you.

890
00:35:31,707 --> 00:35:33,907
- Why? / - You'll make me take pictures.

891
00:35:33,907 --> 00:35:34,374
That's true.

892
00:35:34,374 --> 00:35:37,174
You should take a picture of me just like the movie.

893
00:35:38,674 --> 00:35:42,240
(The day darkens in Vienna)

894
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:45,574
(They head to the last spot for their first day)

895
00:35:46,707 --> 00:35:50,740
(5 minutes to get to Prater from the restaurant)

896
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:52,840
This is the place.

897
00:35:53,074 --> 00:35:56,174
This is the amusement park.

898
00:35:56,174 --> 00:35:57,340
What is it called?

899
00:35:57,640 --> 00:35:59,940
- It's Prater. / - I see.

900
00:36:00,374 --> 00:36:02,307
This is where I wanted to come.

901
00:36:02,307 --> 00:36:05,140
This is the place I wanted to visit so badly.

902
00:36:05,140 --> 00:36:07,040
- Exactly. / - Is this the place?

903
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:10,107
There's an amusement park called Prater here.

904
00:36:10,107 --> 00:36:12,707
In the movie, "Before Sunrise,"

905
00:36:12,707 --> 00:36:16,474
the two characters ride a Ferris wheel.

906
00:36:17,607 --> 00:36:18,607
It's right here.

907
00:36:19,707 --> 00:36:21,240
The Ferris wheel from the movie is here.

908
00:36:22,374 --> 00:36:24,440
Is this why you want to go to this amusement park?

909
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:27,974
They should have a lot of fun rides there too.

910
00:36:27,974 --> 00:36:29,940
It says...

911
00:36:30,107 --> 00:36:33,107
It's the very first amusement park in Europe.

912
00:36:33,107 --> 00:36:34,907
- It's a meaningful place. / - It's the first one.

913
00:36:34,907 --> 00:36:37,474
- You went at night? / - It's fun to be there at night.

914
00:36:37,474 --> 00:36:39,707
- It was really nice. / - It's like a movie.

915
00:36:41,140 --> 00:36:45,507
Wendy, are there tickets like free passes?

916
00:36:45,507 --> 00:36:47,340
There are no free passes.

917
00:36:47,340 --> 00:36:49,940
The rides are owned by different people.

918
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:52,774
- Really? / - Yes, there are no free passes.

919
00:36:52,774 --> 00:36:56,474
You have to buy tickets separately.

920
00:36:56,474 --> 00:36:59,140
(There is no entrance fee)

921
00:36:59,140 --> 00:37:03,140
(But you need to buy tickets for each ride)

922
00:37:03,140 --> 00:37:04,307
("Before Sunrise" and "The Third Man" were filmed here)

923
00:37:04,307 --> 00:37:06,874
- There are a lot of fun rides. / - I want to try that.

924
00:37:06,874 --> 00:37:08,507
- That one looks fun. / - It wasn't there when I went.

925
00:37:08,507 --> 00:37:09,874
We have those in Korea too.

926
00:37:09,874 --> 00:37:11,374
Sook, let's go ride that.

927
00:37:11,707 --> 00:37:13,774
- Sook. / - I will hit you.

928
00:37:19,107 --> 00:37:22,874
(Prater Amusement Park)

929
00:37:23,207 --> 00:37:26,540
Finally, I'm in the place I was eager to be.

930
00:37:26,540 --> 00:37:27,640
This is the place.

931
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:30,240
What are you saying?

932
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:32,540
You know the movie I watched five times.

933
00:37:32,540 --> 00:37:34,540
Yes, I know. It's "Before Sunrise."

934
00:37:34,540 --> 00:37:36,440
It's right over there.

935
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:37,774
Is that it?

936
00:37:38,307 --> 00:37:42,507
That's where the two main characters

937
00:37:42,507 --> 00:37:44,240
kiss for the first time.

938
00:37:44,507 --> 00:37:46,407
And I'm here with you?

939
00:37:46,407 --> 00:37:47,540
What about it?

940
00:37:47,540 --> 00:37:50,840
We're just visiting where the movie took place.

941
00:37:51,107 --> 00:37:52,807
- Why am I here? / - Isn't it wonderful?

942
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:55,707
- Why should I be here with you? / - Isn't it romantic?

943
00:37:56,140 --> 00:37:58,340
It's romantic but why should I be here with you?

944
00:37:58,340 --> 00:38:02,074
Why not? We've been friends for so long.

945
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:04,507
- It's pretty though. / - It's beautiful, isn't it?

946
00:38:04,507 --> 00:38:07,174
Let's ride it and get up there.

947
00:38:09,574 --> 00:38:11,307
- Okay. / - It'd be nice, right?

948
00:38:11,307 --> 00:38:13,140
I'm glad I'm riding this with you.

949
00:38:14,107 --> 00:38:15,540
- Let's get in. / - Let's get in.

950
00:38:15,540 --> 00:38:19,074
What is this? It's like a bar here.

951
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:21,874
- Are Ferris wheels all like this? / - No, they aren't.

952
00:38:21,874 --> 00:38:23,540
I've never ridden a Ferris wheel.

953
00:38:25,574 --> 00:38:29,374
It looks like there's a whole room in there.

954
00:38:29,374 --> 00:38:31,740
You can eat in the Ferris wheel too.

955
00:38:32,074 --> 00:38:35,107
It's like a restaurant. They can cook for you too.

956
00:38:35,107 --> 00:38:37,474
- Really? / - You need to make a reservation?

957
00:38:37,474 --> 00:38:39,507
Every car looks a bit different.

958
00:38:39,507 --> 00:38:40,540
How long does one round take?

959
00:38:40,540 --> 00:38:42,174
- It takes about 15 minutes. / - After you go around once...

960
00:38:42,174 --> 00:38:45,274
- You can stay there. / - Until you finish your food.

961
00:38:45,274 --> 00:38:47,907
- Until you finish your food? / - Yes.

962
00:38:47,907 --> 00:38:50,040
- Then it's not bad. / - I'll need 2 hours.

963
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:52,174
If you have to pay every round, you'll get sick.

964
00:38:52,174 --> 00:38:53,840
You'll have to eat so fast.

965
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:54,540
It says you can have a party there too.

966
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:56,974
Every car has different design inside.

967
00:39:00,074 --> 00:39:02,774
- It's very unique. / - It's a bit...

968
00:39:02,774 --> 00:39:04,940
- Like a tower. / - Yes, it is.

969
00:39:05,307 --> 00:39:07,440
It's a moving tower.

970
00:39:10,074 --> 00:39:12,940
- It's so pretty. / - We're already high up.

971
00:39:16,274 --> 00:39:27,074
(They can see the night view of Vienna up there)

972
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:30,440
It's pretty.

973
00:39:32,807 --> 00:39:34,340
This is a pass.

974
00:39:34,507 --> 00:39:35,507
It's nice here, isn't it?

975
00:39:35,674 --> 00:39:38,107
- It's a pass. / - This is the last spot.

976
00:39:38,107 --> 00:39:39,974
This side is pretty as well.

977
00:39:41,174 --> 00:39:43,207
I love watching night views.

978
00:39:44,074 --> 00:39:50,507
The lights at night makes it so beautiful.

979
00:39:51,374 --> 00:39:53,407
Could you take a picture of me?

980
00:39:54,174 --> 00:39:55,440
You? How?

981
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:58,707
(She stays close to the window)

982
00:39:58,707 --> 00:40:00,640
Seulgi, this looks so sad.

983
00:40:01,774 --> 00:40:03,407
- I'm serious. / - Hurry up.

984
00:40:03,407 --> 00:40:06,207
- Could you stand right here? / - Here? Okay.

985
00:40:06,207 --> 00:40:08,207
What are you doing?

986
00:40:08,207 --> 00:40:09,740
What are you trying to do?

987
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:11,007
I'm looking out the window.

988
00:40:11,007 --> 00:40:13,607
- I see. / - I want it this way.

989
00:40:13,607 --> 00:40:15,507
Make it look like a scene from the movie.

990
00:40:16,174 --> 00:40:17,640
Hang on.

991
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:19,240
- Are you sure? / - Yes.

992
00:40:19,740 --> 00:40:21,474
I don't understand what you want.

993
00:40:23,007 --> 00:40:24,974
Look at me, Seulgi...

994
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:28,774
I'm not sure about this.

995
00:40:28,774 --> 00:40:31,740
- I'm not sure. / - I'm not sure.

996
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:33,340
I'm not sure either.

997
00:40:33,340 --> 00:40:34,040
Because they renovated it,

998
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:36,507
so it's not the same.

999
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:45,140
I feel relaxed here.

1000
00:40:45,140 --> 00:40:46,207
Relaxed.

1001
00:40:46,907 --> 00:40:49,540
I can feel relaxed here.

1002
00:40:50,140 --> 00:40:51,574
Whenever I watched the movie,

1003
00:40:51,574 --> 00:40:53,907
I wanted to go to those places.

1004
00:40:53,907 --> 00:40:55,107
I've always thought I'd like to go to

1005
00:40:55,107 --> 00:40:56,974
the places the characters visited.

1006
00:40:56,974 --> 00:40:58,740
And I'm here now.

1007
00:40:58,740 --> 00:41:00,207
It means a lot to me.

1008
00:41:00,207 --> 00:41:02,307
Now that I'm here,

1009
00:41:02,307 --> 00:41:05,307
it's fascinating to see that everything is still here.

1010
00:41:06,474 --> 00:41:08,740
I wanted to get the feeling I got from the movie.

1011
00:41:09,740 --> 00:41:12,374
So I really love this place.

1012
00:41:14,674 --> 00:41:16,607
- Di. / - Gi.

1013
00:41:17,074 --> 00:41:18,540
- Di. / - Gi.

1014
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:20,074
Dip!

1015
00:41:21,607 --> 00:41:23,607
Day 2 in Austria.

1016
00:41:23,607 --> 00:41:25,774
Today, we're going real deep.

1017
00:41:25,774 --> 00:41:28,074
This is Europe.

1018
00:41:28,074 --> 00:41:29,907
I feel like I'm in a movie.

1019
00:41:30,174 --> 00:41:32,774
Yes, I'm the princess.

1020
00:41:33,107 --> 00:41:35,340
(They learn waltz in the country of waltz)

1021
00:41:35,340 --> 00:41:38,707
- I feel my heart pounding. / - Me too.

1022
00:41:38,707 --> 00:41:40,740
We look like we ran away from home.

1023
00:41:40,740 --> 00:41:42,074
We need to go to some place to eat.

1024
00:41:42,074 --> 00:41:43,540
Everyone eats this.

1025
00:41:44,007 --> 00:41:45,140
It tastes great.

1026
00:41:45,140 --> 00:41:46,740
I feel like a local.

1027
00:41:47,540 --> 00:41:49,140
(They taste all kinds of local foods)

1028
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:51,240
It's delicious!

1029
00:41:51,740 --> 00:41:53,174
I feel like a real local.

1030
00:41:53,174 --> 00:41:55,974
(Deep, local tour begins now!)

1031
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:58,274
It's our second day here today.

1032
00:41:58,274 --> 00:42:00,507
Day 2 in Austria.

1033
00:42:00,907 --> 00:42:03,440
- Yesterday, we were tourists here. / - Yes.

1034
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:05,107
- Today... / - We're locals here.

1035
00:42:05,107 --> 00:42:05,974
That's right.

1036
00:42:05,974 --> 00:42:07,840
They look like they live there.

1037
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:10,207
- Exactly. / - That's how we tried to look.

1038
00:42:11,074 --> 00:42:13,574
- Today... / - We're locals here.

1039
00:42:13,674 --> 00:42:16,507
We're going to discover the city in more depth today.

1040
00:42:16,507 --> 00:42:17,740
More in depth?

1041
00:42:17,907 --> 00:42:20,874
- You'll love it. / - Where do we go first?

1042
00:42:20,874 --> 00:42:22,807
- We'll go eat first. / - Going deep?

1043
00:42:23,074 --> 00:42:24,807
We'll have a very local breakfast.

1044
00:42:24,807 --> 00:42:26,174
- Okay. / - Let's go.

1045
00:42:26,474 --> 00:42:27,474
Let's go.

1046
00:42:30,540 --> 00:42:32,940
(Local day in Vienna)

1047
00:42:32,940 --> 00:42:34,474
You're trying the local brunch

1048
00:42:34,474 --> 00:42:35,807
to feel how locals live there.

1049
00:42:35,807 --> 00:42:37,040
- Exactly. / - Yes.

1050
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:39,474
- Brunch is delicious. / - You can get there by foot.

1051
00:42:39,474 --> 00:42:42,407
- It's right here. / - Everything's close by.

1052
00:42:42,407 --> 00:42:44,707
Most cafes here sell brunch.

1053
00:42:45,207 --> 00:42:47,574
They all have breakfast menus.

1054
00:42:47,574 --> 00:42:49,474
So we can eat breakfast here.

1055
00:42:49,474 --> 00:42:51,274
Do you see that over there?

1056
00:42:51,274 --> 00:42:52,874
It's written, "K.u.K."

1057
00:42:52,874 --> 00:42:57,107
It means they used to deliver their food to the palace.

1058
00:42:57,274 --> 00:43:01,174
- If "K.u.K" is written... / - I'm curious.

1059
00:43:01,174 --> 00:43:04,107
It means that place is beyond average.

1060
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:08,040
You're very straightforward.

1061
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:10,307
It's easy to understand what you're trying to say.

1062
00:43:10,807 --> 00:43:13,407
- I'm so hungry. Let's hurry. / - Right? Okay.

1063
00:43:15,107 --> 00:43:16,507
Goodness, it looks amazing.

1064
00:43:17,740 --> 00:43:19,740
There are so many cakes here.

1065
00:43:21,507 --> 00:43:22,440
It looks nice inside.

1066
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:23,907
Women would love this place.

1067
00:43:23,907 --> 00:43:26,474
- It looks delicious. / - There are so many bakery.

1068
00:43:26,474 --> 00:43:28,874
- I'm so hungry. / - I'd like to eat all of them.

1069
00:43:28,874 --> 00:43:30,607
I'd say, "From here to here please."

1070
00:43:30,607 --> 00:43:32,407
- It looks delicious. / - The coffee looks good.

1071
00:43:32,407 --> 00:43:34,707
When I was in Austria, I loved their bread too.

1072
00:43:34,707 --> 00:43:35,940
- Right? / - The bread is so delicious.

1073
00:43:35,940 --> 00:43:37,574
They eat bread so often that

1074
00:43:37,574 --> 00:43:39,540
they have a bread for before bedtime.

1075
00:43:39,540 --> 00:43:41,107
- Really? / - Yes.

1076
00:43:42,574 --> 00:43:45,040
(The locals come to this place to have brunch)

1077
00:43:46,540 --> 00:43:48,240
- I love the atmosphere here. / - It's nice, right?

1078
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:49,740
- I love the wallpaper. / - I know.

1079
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:52,374
- It's so girly. / - It's a flower pattern.

1080
00:43:52,374 --> 00:43:55,574
- It's what we love. / - It was our kind of design.

1081
00:43:55,574 --> 00:43:57,440
When you go to such a place,

1082
00:43:57,440 --> 00:43:59,107
what matters more to you, the food or the vibe?

1083
00:43:59,107 --> 00:44:01,240
- Both. / - Both are important.

1084
00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:03,874
- Both are important. / - I see.

1085
00:44:03,874 --> 00:44:06,507
You look like a part of the seat now.

1086
00:44:07,374 --> 00:44:08,740
You and the sofa have become one.

1087
00:44:09,540 --> 00:44:12,507
- It's red and we're Red Velvet. / - That's right.

1088
00:44:12,507 --> 00:44:14,807
I see red everywhere here.

1089
00:44:14,807 --> 00:44:17,807
- I heard that people here like red. / - I see.

1090
00:44:18,274 --> 00:44:20,474
It's here.

1091
00:44:21,207 --> 00:44:22,874
- Omelet and orange juice? / - Yes!

1092
00:44:24,607 --> 00:44:26,974
(The first local meal)

1093
00:44:26,974 --> 00:44:29,040
- It looks so good. / - What is it called?

1094
00:44:29,174 --> 00:44:30,540
- The three-tier stand. / - Afternoon tea?

1095
00:44:30,540 --> 00:44:32,107
- It's not it. / - It's not afternoon tea.

1096
00:44:32,107 --> 00:44:34,340
- It's not afternoon tea. / - What is that?

1097
00:44:34,340 --> 00:44:36,674
- It's a boiled egg. / - That's how they eat...

1098
00:44:36,674 --> 00:44:38,574
- Boiled eggs there. / - That's how they eat it.

1099
00:44:39,874 --> 00:44:40,874
I want to eat that.

1100
00:44:40,874 --> 00:44:42,740
Shall we start?

1101
00:44:42,807 --> 00:44:44,007
Do you know what this is?

1102
00:44:44,840 --> 00:44:45,940
This is...

1103
00:44:46,374 --> 00:44:47,940
- It's a croissant. / - Isn't it a croissant?

1104
00:44:48,174 --> 00:44:49,407
- Kipferl? / - Kipferl.

1105
00:44:49,407 --> 00:44:51,074
- I studied a bit. / - Kipferl.

1106
00:44:51,074 --> 00:44:54,040
This is the ancestor of croissant.

1107
00:44:55,974 --> 00:44:57,140
Kipferl.

1108
00:44:59,074 --> 00:45:01,740
(Seulgi's learning channel)

1109
00:45:01,740 --> 00:45:05,307
This was invented first in Austria.

1110
00:45:05,307 --> 00:45:08,507
Marie Antoinette was Austrian.

1111
00:45:08,507 --> 00:45:11,940
She married French king, Louis XVI.

1112
00:45:11,940 --> 00:45:14,640
She wanted to eat this so badly there.

1113
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:17,140
So she asked the French bakers to make this.

1114
00:45:17,140 --> 00:45:20,240
That's how croissant was invented in France.

1115
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:22,074
(French people made croissant instead of kipferl)

1116
00:45:22,707 --> 00:45:25,440
- She studied hard. / - Good job.

1117
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:27,674
Show how it looks inside the bread.

1118
00:45:28,074 --> 00:45:29,740
- It looks different. / - It looks drier.

1119
00:45:30,107 --> 00:45:31,240
It's just like a croissant.

1120
00:45:31,240 --> 00:45:33,440
It was definitely lighter.

1121
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:35,474
- It looks similar. / - Does it taste similar to it too?

1122
00:45:35,474 --> 00:45:36,840
It tastes similar to it.

1123
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:38,274
- It looks less greasy. / - It is.

1124
00:45:38,274 --> 00:45:40,407
- They probably use less butter. / - Exactly.

1125
00:45:40,407 --> 00:45:41,274
(You're right)

1126
00:45:41,740 --> 00:45:42,840
You'll get shocked if you see...

1127
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:44,107
- How croissants are made. / - Right, right.

1128
00:45:44,107 --> 00:45:45,974
It's full of butter.

1129
00:45:46,207 --> 00:45:48,240
You use a lot of butter to make it.

1130
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:50,674
They seem to use butter moderately there.

1131
00:45:50,674 --> 00:45:51,807
It's light.

1132
00:45:52,074 --> 00:45:53,240
Try it.

1133
00:45:53,807 --> 00:45:55,274
I'll eat it with jam.

1134
00:45:57,074 --> 00:45:58,207
How is it?

1135
00:45:58,207 --> 00:45:59,874
Most croissants...

1136
00:46:00,307 --> 00:46:02,507
Melt in your mouth.

1137
00:46:02,507 --> 00:46:06,274
There's nothing much to chew.

1138
00:46:06,474 --> 00:46:08,974
This bread is delicious.

1139
00:46:08,974 --> 00:46:12,574
You can feel the true flavor of the bread.

1140
00:46:12,574 --> 00:46:14,707
- She's right. / - It must be savory.

1141
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:18,007
This is apricot jam.

1142
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:20,374
I heard they eat a lot of apricots here.

1143
00:46:20,374 --> 00:46:21,174
Really?

1144
00:46:21,774 --> 00:46:24,040
- Try the jam. / - It's delicious.

1145
00:46:25,974 --> 00:46:29,007
- This bread is so... / - Try the jam.

1146
00:46:29,007 --> 00:46:30,207
- She looks like she likes it. / - Hurry up.

1147
00:46:30,207 --> 00:46:31,840
- Eat it with some butter. / - Try this.

1148
00:46:32,074 --> 00:46:33,207
Try it with the jam.

1149
00:46:33,340 --> 00:46:35,207
The apricot jam was so delicious.

1150
00:46:35,207 --> 00:46:39,607
The jam would make anything taste good.

1151
00:46:39,640 --> 00:46:41,007
The apricot jam was really good.

1152
00:46:41,007 --> 00:46:42,774
- Did you buy it or not? / - I did buy it.

1153
00:46:42,940 --> 00:46:44,807
- You must buy it. / - Is it better than strawberry jam?

1154
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:47,274
- It's way better than that. / - I love apricot jam.

1155
00:46:47,540 --> 00:46:48,607
I thought nothing was better than strawberry jam.

1156
00:46:48,607 --> 00:46:49,640
Apricot jam!

1157
00:46:50,140 --> 00:46:52,807
This is the best brunch bread I have ever had.

1158
00:46:53,774 --> 00:46:55,874
We've only tried the first bread.

1159
00:46:55,874 --> 00:46:57,140
I'm going to eat this now.

1160
00:46:57,140 --> 00:46:59,640
- Go ahead. / - I should eat it when it's warm.

1161
00:47:00,674 --> 00:47:03,407
- The egg? / - They eat eggs differently...

1162
00:47:03,974 --> 00:47:05,140
In Austria.

1163
00:47:05,407 --> 00:47:06,940
You don't crack and peel it?

1164
00:47:06,940 --> 00:47:08,440
- I will look it up. / - We should pretend we know it.

1165
00:47:08,440 --> 00:47:10,040
We should pretend we know it.

1166
00:47:10,040 --> 00:47:11,907
We learned how to eat it from a video.

1167
00:47:11,907 --> 00:47:13,274
"Gently tap it."

1168
00:47:13,674 --> 00:47:15,674
- Then it breaks. / - It does.

1169
00:47:15,674 --> 00:47:16,974
Tap it?

1170
00:47:18,974 --> 00:47:20,574
You tap the top of it.

1171
00:47:20,940 --> 00:47:23,040
Exactly. You should break the top of the egg.

1172
00:47:23,740 --> 00:47:24,774
And?

1173
00:47:24,774 --> 00:47:27,474
(Cut the top part with a knife)

1174
00:47:27,474 --> 00:47:29,140
Cut off...

1175
00:47:29,140 --> 00:47:31,174
- The top part. / - Cut it off?

1176
00:47:31,807 --> 00:47:34,740
- Eat it. / - You don't have to do that.

1177
00:47:35,907 --> 00:47:38,107
That's the proper way to eat it.

1178
00:47:38,107 --> 00:47:40,607
- You put salt on top. / - Add salt and pepper.

1179
00:47:40,907 --> 00:47:42,440
Then eat it with a spoon.

1180
00:47:42,440 --> 00:47:46,307
(Then you can eat it with a spoon)

1181
00:47:48,007 --> 00:47:49,140
Let me try it.

1182
00:47:49,274 --> 00:47:50,707
Isn't it too salty? Is it okay?

1183
00:47:51,107 --> 00:47:52,807
- It's delicious. / - Is it good?

1184
00:47:54,307 --> 00:47:56,374
I'll eat eggs like this from now on.

1185
00:47:57,707 --> 00:47:58,807
It's good, isn't it?

1186
00:47:59,874 --> 00:48:01,940
Isn't it really soft?

1187
00:48:02,074 --> 00:48:03,607
It tastes like milk.

1188
00:48:04,074 --> 00:48:06,640
You can just scrape it like this. It all comes out.

1189
00:48:07,274 --> 00:48:08,940
Everything comes out.

1190
00:48:09,407 --> 00:48:10,574
How can you cook it like this?

1191
00:48:10,774 --> 00:48:14,174
You can peel the egg shell at once like that.

1192
00:48:14,440 --> 00:48:16,007
It must be convenient to clean up.

1193
00:48:16,474 --> 00:48:18,040
It's easy to peel it because

1194
00:48:18,040 --> 00:48:19,974
it's rinsed well in cold water.

1195
00:48:22,974 --> 00:48:27,207
(They start eating the brunch for real)

1196
00:48:29,507 --> 00:48:31,340
(They enjoy the brunch just like the locals)

1197
00:48:31,340 --> 00:48:33,307
- The bread was so delicious. / - I want to eat it.

1198
00:48:33,307 --> 00:48:35,940
- We ordered extra bread. / - We did.

1199
00:48:37,140 --> 00:48:39,074
It's good, isn't it? Do you like it?

1200
00:48:39,074 --> 00:48:40,440
Do you like your breakfast?

1201
00:48:41,207 --> 00:48:42,207
It's nice, isn't it?

1202
00:48:42,207 --> 00:48:44,007
We're now going to

1203
00:48:44,007 --> 00:48:46,507
where we can be like real Austrians.

1204
00:48:46,507 --> 00:48:49,174
You don't have to say things like that.

1205
00:48:49,174 --> 00:48:51,274
- Right now, I feel like a local. / - Right?

1206
00:48:51,540 --> 00:48:53,807
Keep that mindset.

1207
00:48:54,007 --> 00:48:55,707
Where are you going after the brunch?

1208
00:48:55,840 --> 00:48:58,140
We're going to ride a carriage now.

1209
00:48:58,140 --> 00:49:00,040
We're going to ride a fiaker.

1210
00:49:00,040 --> 00:49:04,107
(7 minutes on foot from the brunch cafe to Hofburg)

1211
00:49:04,707 --> 00:49:08,107
I prepared something for you here.

1212
00:49:08,540 --> 00:49:10,140
What is it?

1213
00:49:10,207 --> 00:49:11,674
- Are you curious? / - Yes.

1214
00:49:12,007 --> 00:49:14,874
It's none other than that.

1215
00:49:15,074 --> 00:49:16,407
- That? / - A carriage.

1216
00:49:16,407 --> 00:49:17,174
- A carriage? / - Yes.

1217
00:49:17,174 --> 00:49:19,474
- A carriage? / - It's so pretty, isn't it?

1218
00:49:19,474 --> 00:49:21,474
The horses look so cool.

1219
00:49:21,474 --> 00:49:22,974
It looks cool.

1220
00:49:22,974 --> 00:49:24,740
(Fiaker tour)

1221
00:49:24,740 --> 00:49:28,207
(You can look around the old town of Vienna)

1222
00:49:29,974 --> 00:49:31,407
It was really nice.

1223
00:49:31,407 --> 00:49:34,274
I recommend you to ride it even though

1224
00:49:34,274 --> 00:49:35,474
it's a little expensive.

1225
00:49:35,474 --> 00:49:36,374
As soon as you get on the carriage,

1226
00:49:36,374 --> 00:49:37,540
you go back to the medieval times.

1227
00:49:37,540 --> 00:49:39,640
- It makes you feel like it. / - You're right.

1228
00:49:40,507 --> 00:49:42,340
Can you go somewhere on that carriage?

1229
00:49:42,340 --> 00:49:44,574
- You ride around the city. / - You just tour the city.

1230
00:49:44,574 --> 00:49:45,674
(Hofburg, Michaelerplatz)

1231
00:49:45,674 --> 00:49:46,774
(National library, St. Peter's Church)

1232
00:49:47,074 --> 00:49:48,274
- Hi. / - Hi.

1233
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:49,907
Hello.

1234
00:49:50,674 --> 00:49:51,940
(They get escorted on the fiaker)

1235
00:49:51,940 --> 00:49:53,374
We're on it.

1236
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:55,807
It makes you feel like you've become a princess.

1237
00:49:55,807 --> 00:49:58,540
- It must make you feel good. / - You feel like royalty.

1238
00:49:58,874 --> 00:50:00,307
I wonder how you say it in German.

1239
00:50:00,307 --> 00:50:01,874
Let's go.

1240
00:50:02,140 --> 00:50:04,740
- Gosh, it's so pretty. / - Hi.

1241
00:50:05,940 --> 00:50:07,740
I have to take a picture of this.

1242
00:50:07,740 --> 00:50:12,907
(Even the entrance of the palace is beautiful)

1243
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:16,707
It seems like this is where

1244
00:50:16,707 --> 00:50:18,640
the carriages can go through.

1245
00:50:18,807 --> 00:50:19,774
(Vienna has a classy vibe just like in the Middle Ages)

1246
00:50:19,774 --> 00:50:21,607
There are so many horses.

1247
00:50:21,607 --> 00:50:22,807
There were a lot.

1248
00:50:25,307 --> 00:50:28,374
That's from the Roman Empire.

1249
00:50:28,374 --> 00:50:31,840
He just said it's about 2,000 years old.

1250
00:50:31,840 --> 00:50:33,107
- That one? / - Yes.

1251
00:50:33,774 --> 00:50:36,240
(Michaelerplatz)

1252
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:41,040
(It's a square in front of the Hofburg)

1253
00:50:41,740 --> 00:50:44,274
Look at that over there. It's so pretty.

1254
00:50:44,274 --> 00:50:45,507
It's incredible.

1255
00:50:46,140 --> 00:50:47,174
(Austrian National Library)

1256
00:50:47,174 --> 00:50:48,374
(The largest baroque library in Europe)

1257
00:50:48,374 --> 00:50:50,574
They all look beautiful.

1258
00:50:52,507 --> 00:50:54,840
This is what you call Europe.

1259
00:50:56,007 --> 00:50:58,640
It's like an amusement park here.

1260
00:50:59,074 --> 00:51:00,574
- Hello. / - Thank you.

1261
00:51:00,774 --> 00:51:01,807
Hello.

1262
00:51:01,807 --> 00:51:04,907
The buildings are so beautiful

1263
00:51:04,907 --> 00:51:08,040
and the streets are so different.

1264
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:10,640
Austria is where you can make

1265
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:12,207
all your dreams come true.

1266
00:51:12,207 --> 00:51:13,874
I love it here.

1267
00:51:15,374 --> 00:51:16,740
Back in the old days,

1268
00:51:16,740 --> 00:51:18,474
people used to ride carriages like this.

1269
00:51:19,407 --> 00:51:21,374
It was like a scene from a movie.

1270
00:51:21,474 --> 00:51:23,607
While riding the carriage,

1271
00:51:23,607 --> 00:51:25,907
could you stop it and get off if you want to?

1272
00:51:25,907 --> 00:51:27,440
If you take an hour tour,

1273
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:30,174
you can get off the carriage wherever you like.

1274
00:51:30,174 --> 00:51:32,440
- Really? / - You can get off?

1275
00:51:32,907 --> 00:51:33,874
Back in the old days,

1276
00:51:33,874 --> 00:51:35,907
people used to ride carriages like this.

1277
00:51:37,874 --> 00:51:39,940
(Right now, they're the masters of their own time)

1278
00:51:39,940 --> 00:51:42,307
- It's like a fairytale here. / - It is.

1279
00:51:45,807 --> 00:51:48,207
Aren't the streets in Austria very clean?

1280
00:51:48,207 --> 00:51:50,174
- They are clean. / - They're very clean.

1281
00:51:50,207 --> 00:51:52,140
There are so many stores there too.

1282
00:51:53,240 --> 00:51:56,174
It's so pretty here. I'm so happy now.

1283
00:51:56,174 --> 00:51:57,407
I'm so happy.

1284
00:51:57,407 --> 00:51:58,807
I felt your happiness just now.

1285
00:51:59,607 --> 00:52:02,374
There's nothing much

1286
00:52:02,374 --> 00:52:03,940
in making a good country to live in.

1287
00:52:04,274 --> 00:52:07,507
Whether a country is a good place to live in,

1288
00:52:07,507 --> 00:52:08,940
depends on how happy you can be there.

1289
00:52:09,474 --> 00:52:12,440
To be happy, you need to have ease of mind.

1290
00:52:13,374 --> 00:52:16,040
- Don't they look so happy right now? / - They do.

1291
00:52:18,607 --> 00:52:21,507
Riding a carriage,

1292
00:52:21,507 --> 00:52:23,607
passing through the old buildings,

1293
00:52:23,607 --> 00:52:25,040
I feel like I've become an Austrian.

1294
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:29,007
The two look way happier than they started the tour.

1295
00:52:29,974 --> 00:52:31,140
I was very happy when I was riding the carriage.

1296
00:52:31,140 --> 00:52:33,507
- I was so happy. / - You look very happy.

1297
00:52:33,674 --> 00:52:34,807
- Is it already over? / - Yes.

1298
00:52:35,074 --> 00:52:38,374
Seriously, it felt like it was shorter than 10 minutes.

1299
00:52:41,674 --> 00:52:44,640
- Waltz. / - The waltz is next.

1300
00:52:45,274 --> 00:52:47,574
I want to learn something new.

1301
00:52:47,574 --> 00:52:50,107
I found that you could learn waltz there.

1302
00:52:50,107 --> 00:52:51,207
The dance?

1303
00:52:51,774 --> 00:52:53,440
I have never done it before either.

1304
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:56,174
Since we both are beginners, we'll just learn a bit.

1305
00:52:56,174 --> 00:52:58,107
We'll learn what waltz is like.

1306
00:52:58,107 --> 00:52:59,907
Should I take a waltz class before going there?

1307
00:52:59,907 --> 00:53:01,407
Let's take a look.

1308
00:53:01,407 --> 00:53:03,940
You can learn the waltz in 5 minutes, right?

1309
00:53:04,507 --> 00:53:05,640
- No way. / - It was so difficult.

1310
00:53:05,640 --> 00:53:08,140
- Why? / - I'm a terrible dancer.

1311
00:53:08,674 --> 00:53:10,440
Waltz...

1312
00:53:10,440 --> 00:53:12,574
Do you think we could learn the waltz?

1313
00:53:12,840 --> 00:53:14,074
Honestly...

1314
00:53:14,474 --> 00:53:16,007
I'm a slow learner even when we

1315
00:53:16,007 --> 00:53:17,507
learn our own choreography.

1316
00:53:17,507 --> 00:53:19,440
I'm on the slow side.

1317
00:53:19,807 --> 00:53:22,274
Dancing is hard for me.

1318
00:53:22,274 --> 00:53:25,174
I have never learned the waltz before.

1319
00:53:26,207 --> 00:53:29,140
It feels like a classy dance.

1320
00:53:29,807 --> 00:53:32,640
- It's a classy dance. / - Right.

1321
00:53:33,474 --> 00:53:36,374
I heard Austrians

1322
00:53:36,374 --> 00:53:40,307
learn the waltz in waltz schools.

1323
00:53:40,307 --> 00:53:41,640
That's awesome.

1324
00:53:42,040 --> 00:53:43,640
They all learn that, right?

1325
00:53:43,640 --> 00:53:48,507
In Austria, they have waltz classes in high school.

1326
00:53:48,507 --> 00:53:50,174
- They have waltz classes? / - Yes.

1327
00:53:50,174 --> 00:53:53,040
- It's a basic skill. / - That's what their parties are like.

1328
00:53:55,007 --> 00:53:56,907
- What if I can't do it? / - You can do it.

1329
00:53:56,907 --> 00:53:58,974
(50-minute waltz class, $81.90 per person)

1330
00:53:59,774 --> 00:54:01,974
(How will Seulgi and Wendy look?)

1331
00:54:01,974 --> 00:54:03,607
We even put on the costume.

1332
00:54:03,874 --> 00:54:05,207
- It feels awkward. / - It does.

1333
00:54:05,207 --> 00:54:07,040
I feel like I'm having a graduation ceremony.

1334
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:08,440
I feel like I'm going to a foreign graduation ceremony.

1335
00:54:08,440 --> 00:54:10,174
They look good in the dresses.

1336
00:54:10,174 --> 00:54:12,007
We're in black and white.

1337
00:54:12,807 --> 00:54:16,040
I heard there are great dancers here.

1338
00:54:16,040 --> 00:54:16,574
Great dancers?

1339
00:54:16,574 --> 00:54:19,374
The Baek Jongwon of waltz.

1340
00:54:19,374 --> 00:54:22,207
The Baek Jongwon of waltz?

1341
00:54:22,207 --> 00:54:23,540
That sounds strange.

1342
00:54:23,740 --> 00:54:26,140
For our waltz...

1343
00:54:26,540 --> 00:54:28,474
- Hello. / - Good afternoon.

1344
00:54:28,474 --> 00:54:31,374
- Good afternoon. / - Welcome to our school.

1345
00:54:32,707 --> 00:54:35,307
- He was so cool. / - He was really cool.

1346
00:54:35,807 --> 00:54:37,940
Are you dancing in Korea?

1347
00:54:37,940 --> 00:54:41,107
Yeah, we are a... We dance and sing.

1348
00:54:41,107 --> 00:54:42,340
"Red Flavor."

1349
00:54:44,107 --> 00:54:45,740
Then there's absolutely no problem.

1350
00:54:45,740 --> 00:54:46,807
But we dance differently.

1351
00:54:46,807 --> 00:54:50,007
He was a true gentleman.

1352
00:54:50,007 --> 00:54:55,307
(They learn the basic steps first)

1353
00:54:55,674 --> 00:54:57,774
He trained us really hard.

1354
00:54:58,974 --> 00:55:01,140
It looks easy though. Was it difficult?

1355
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:04,474
I felt dizzy when I changed directions.

1356
00:55:04,474 --> 00:55:06,007
Turn to the left quickly

1357
00:55:06,007 --> 00:55:06,874
if you feel dizzy.

1358
00:55:06,874 --> 00:55:08,940
Just turn to the left.

1359
00:55:08,940 --> 00:55:10,340
- Okay? / - Yes.

1360
00:55:10,340 --> 00:55:11,207
Now,

1361
00:55:11,207 --> 00:55:15,107
we will have Viennese waltz, original speed.

1362
00:55:16,407 --> 00:55:18,540
- Original speed? / - How fast is the original speed?

1363
00:55:18,907 --> 00:55:20,174
Only to the right.

1364
00:55:20,174 --> 00:55:21,740
Okay. To the right.

1365
00:55:21,874 --> 00:55:23,007
We don't go to the left. We only go to the right.

1366
00:55:23,007 --> 00:55:24,440
Okay.

1367
00:55:27,574 --> 00:55:28,907
That's the dance they're used to.

1368
00:55:28,907 --> 00:55:31,107
- I know. / - Red Velvet...

1369
00:55:31,107 --> 00:55:33,074
Their choreography is very difficult.

1370
00:55:33,074 --> 00:55:35,474
- It's difficult. I tried it before. / - It's really difficult.

1371
00:55:35,474 --> 00:55:36,574
It's hard.

1372
00:55:36,740 --> 00:55:39,140
- You danced to their song? / - Yes, for my concert.

1373
00:55:40,207 --> 00:55:41,774
I danced to "Russian Roulette"

1374
00:55:41,774 --> 00:55:42,807
and it almost killed me.

1375
00:55:45,174 --> 00:55:46,707
(How will Red Velvet dance to the waltz?)

1376
00:55:46,707 --> 00:55:49,040
- You know this music? / - Yes.

1377
00:55:49,807 --> 00:55:51,240
Lean back.

1378
00:55:52,507 --> 00:55:53,707
It's starting now.

1379
00:55:54,340 --> 00:55:57,374
1, 2, 3... And 1.

1380
00:55:59,574 --> 00:56:00,340
It's fast.

1381
00:56:00,340 --> 00:56:01,807
Is this the original speed?

1382
00:56:01,807 --> 00:56:05,974
This was a relatively slow song.

1383
00:56:07,774 --> 00:56:09,107
Wait a minute.

1384
00:56:10,374 --> 00:56:12,540
- What was that? / - You're just being dragged.

1385
00:56:12,540 --> 00:56:15,074
- We were just being dragged. / - I know.

1386
00:56:15,074 --> 00:56:17,040
That's because he was a lot taller than me.

1387
00:56:17,207 --> 00:56:18,474
Wait a minute.

1388
00:56:19,507 --> 00:56:21,440
Wait a minute.

1389
00:56:21,440 --> 00:56:22,940
Wait.

1390
00:56:24,840 --> 00:56:26,340
My gosh.

1391
00:56:29,974 --> 00:56:30,840
I'm so dizzy.

1392
00:56:32,207 --> 00:56:33,007
No, it's...

1393
00:56:33,007 --> 00:56:35,774
- I think I can do that. / - They learned the steps.

1394
00:56:36,174 --> 00:56:37,674
Didn't they learn the steps?

1395
00:56:37,807 --> 00:56:39,940
- What are they doing? / - What was that?

1396
00:56:41,274 --> 00:56:43,407
- This is hard. / - It's like you're being controlled.

1397
00:56:43,407 --> 00:56:45,007
Hey...

1398
00:56:45,007 --> 00:56:46,740
But their faces look like they're dancing very well.

1399
00:56:46,740 --> 00:56:48,074
This is strange.

1400
00:56:48,240 --> 00:56:51,207
- It's really weird. / - Look at their feet.

1401
00:56:52,107 --> 00:56:54,240
Gosh, I can't do this.

1402
00:56:55,974 --> 00:56:57,707
He was very strict.

1403
00:56:58,540 --> 00:57:00,474
He was very strict.

1404
00:57:01,540 --> 00:57:03,007
It's too fast.

1405
00:57:03,307 --> 00:57:05,874
- Sorry. / - It's like I'm being controlled.

1406
00:57:08,574 --> 00:57:15,007
(They are getting better with the instructors' lead)

1407
00:57:17,840 --> 00:57:19,207
They look better now.

1408
00:57:20,040 --> 00:57:25,407
You are the best students we've had here.

1409
00:57:25,407 --> 00:57:26,540
What did he say?

1410
00:57:26,540 --> 00:57:28,874
- What? / - He's being nice.

1411
00:57:29,340 --> 00:57:32,440
That's how he keeps his classes running.

1412
00:57:32,540 --> 00:57:34,340
He's being too nice.

1413
00:57:35,207 --> 00:57:36,940
I guarantee.

1414
00:57:36,940 --> 00:57:38,640
I will give you 10 points.

1415
00:57:39,474 --> 00:57:40,240
Out of 100.

1416
00:57:40,240 --> 00:57:42,107
- You're lying. / - 10 out of 100?

1417
00:57:42,107 --> 00:57:44,240
We just watched their steps. That's impossible.

1418
00:57:44,240 --> 00:57:45,707
I'm so moved.

1419
00:57:45,807 --> 00:57:47,174
Can I give you a little hug?

1420
00:57:47,174 --> 00:57:48,540
Thank you.

1421
00:57:48,940 --> 00:57:50,340
Thank you very much.

1422
00:57:50,340 --> 00:57:51,874
- I feel dizzy. / - Let's just do this.

1423
00:57:51,874 --> 00:57:53,440
We should just be born again.

1424
00:57:54,040 --> 00:57:55,640
That's what they're good at.

1425
00:57:56,474 --> 00:57:58,407
- That looks much better. / - They're excited.

1426
00:57:58,407 --> 00:57:59,874
I feel better just watching them.

1427
00:58:00,174 --> 00:58:01,240
Let's go.

1428
00:58:01,240 --> 00:58:03,507
(Absorbed)

1429
00:58:03,507 --> 00:58:05,907
- You should've taught them that. / - Right.

1430
00:58:05,907 --> 00:58:08,307
They got shocked seeing us dance like that.

1431
00:58:08,307 --> 00:58:09,274
He looked confused.

1432
00:58:09,274 --> 00:58:11,840
- He was shocked. / - Now it's time to have rib soup.

1433
00:58:11,840 --> 00:58:12,874
- I'm looking forward to it. / - Rib soup.

1434
00:58:12,874 --> 00:58:15,740
You're hungry after dancing the waltz, right?

1435
00:58:16,307 --> 00:58:18,607
So I prepared something.

1436
00:58:18,674 --> 00:58:22,140
This is like rib soup, in a way.

1437
00:58:22,140 --> 00:58:24,640
- What? Rib soup? / - Yes. It's a soup.

1438
00:58:24,807 --> 00:58:26,040
I love it.

1439
00:58:26,040 --> 00:58:27,007
You didn't go to a Korean restaurant, did you?

1440
00:58:27,007 --> 00:58:28,607
- No. / - It's not a Korean restaurant.

1441
00:58:28,607 --> 00:58:30,707
You wanted to eat Korean foods though, right?

1442
00:58:30,707 --> 00:58:32,574
- Yes. / - From the first day.

1443
00:58:32,574 --> 00:58:34,407
I wanted to have some soup.

1444
00:58:34,407 --> 00:58:38,474
We rode a carriage and spent much time outside,

1445
00:58:38,474 --> 00:58:40,540
so we wanted to have some soup.

1446
00:58:42,140 --> 00:58:43,507
Look at this.

1447
00:58:43,740 --> 00:58:46,507
It says "world famous" on here.

1448
00:58:46,507 --> 00:58:48,207
Tafelspitz?

1449
00:58:49,140 --> 00:58:51,540
It seems popular, so I just ordered it.

1450
00:58:51,607 --> 00:58:53,807
- It's tafelspitz. / - Is this it?

1451
00:58:54,140 --> 00:58:55,374
This one?

1452
00:58:55,374 --> 00:58:56,774
- Is it this part? / - It's the buttocks?

1453
00:58:56,774 --> 00:58:58,140
We're eating a cow's buttocks.

1454
00:58:58,140 --> 00:58:59,374
Buttocks?

1455
00:59:02,540 --> 00:59:04,307
It really looks like rib soup.

1456
00:59:04,507 --> 00:59:06,674
I can't believe that. I have to see it for myself.

1457
00:59:08,307 --> 00:59:10,674
(It's served with an appetizer)

1458
00:59:11,340 --> 00:59:13,840
- What's that? / - Is it pasta?

1459
00:59:14,607 --> 00:59:17,774
When I heard it's like rib soup,

1460
00:59:17,774 --> 00:59:20,707
I didn't believe it until the food was served.

1461
00:59:20,707 --> 00:59:22,840
(Tafelspitz is beef loin boiled with root vegetables)

1462
00:59:22,840 --> 00:59:24,274
- It really looks like rib soup. / - You're right.

1463
00:59:24,274 --> 00:59:25,540
It does look like rib soup.

1464
00:59:25,540 --> 00:59:26,974
It was very tender.

1465
00:59:27,507 --> 00:59:30,074
- It looks so good. / - It was really soft and tender.

1466
00:59:32,907 --> 00:59:35,574
(Tafelspitz, $30)

1467
00:59:36,907 --> 00:59:39,474
So, this is how it's served.

1468
00:59:40,107 --> 00:59:42,540
That's why they have this first.

1469
00:59:43,007 --> 00:59:45,240
- It's served like that? / - It's sliced omelet.

1470
00:59:45,240 --> 00:59:47,340
- You eat it like noodles? / - Yes.

1471
00:59:47,340 --> 00:59:50,474
- Sliced omelet? / - You eat that first.

1472
00:59:50,474 --> 00:59:52,474
- They're pancakes. / - Pancakes?

1473
00:59:52,474 --> 00:59:54,240
- What? / - Is it a pancake?

1474
00:59:54,507 --> 00:59:56,907
I thought it was sliced eggs

1475
00:59:56,907 --> 00:59:57,607
but he says it's a pancake.

1476
00:59:58,074 --> 01:00:00,740
- It's a salted pancake. / - That's amazing.

1477
01:00:00,740 --> 01:00:04,040
It's very unique. They thinly sliced the pancake.

1478
01:00:04,040 --> 01:00:05,240
Wow.

1479
01:00:07,174 --> 01:00:08,340
It's rib soup.

1480
01:00:09,407 --> 01:00:10,840
It tastes really light.

1481
01:00:12,374 --> 01:00:14,974
It tastes like Korean food.

1482
01:00:14,974 --> 01:00:19,107
Some Koreans like to eat it with some rice.

1483
01:00:19,107 --> 01:00:20,540
It's not traditional Austrian food, is it?

1484
01:00:20,540 --> 01:00:22,007
I'll try this.

1485
01:00:22,474 --> 01:00:25,474
- It's really good. / - I'll eat the pancake like spaghetti.

1486
01:00:25,474 --> 01:00:26,507
The soup is so good.

1487
01:00:26,507 --> 01:00:28,774
- You should eat it with the soup. / - It's a pancake.

1488
01:00:29,407 --> 01:00:30,607
Is it good?

1489
01:00:31,340 --> 01:00:33,740
- You should try it. / - When Seulgi likes the food...

1490
01:00:33,740 --> 01:00:36,107
Her eyes get big and she tells Wendy to try it.

1491
01:00:36,607 --> 01:00:37,874
That's right.

1492
01:00:39,140 --> 01:00:40,607
It's very unique, right?

1493
01:00:41,074 --> 01:00:43,074
It tastes like sliced eggs.

1494
01:00:44,107 --> 01:00:46,140
- It doesn't taste like a pancake. / - Right?

1495
01:00:46,307 --> 01:00:49,374
It tastes like sliced eggs or pasta.

1496
01:00:50,340 --> 01:00:51,240
This is interesting.

1497
01:00:51,240 --> 01:00:53,440
I can't believe this is a pancake.

1498
01:00:53,507 --> 01:00:57,440
I'm impressed that it goes well with the soup.

1499
01:00:57,774 --> 01:01:00,040
I know it's unique but is it also good?

1500
01:01:00,040 --> 01:01:01,540
- Yes, it was delicious. / - It was?

1501
01:01:01,540 --> 01:01:04,774
- I liked it. / - I don't know how to describe it.

1502
01:01:04,774 --> 01:01:07,774
It's like you eat egg bread with rib soup.

1503
01:01:07,774 --> 01:01:09,340
- This is great. / - It's really good.

1504
01:01:10,707 --> 01:01:12,040
I ate it all already.

1505
01:01:12,540 --> 01:01:13,840
What should I eat now?

1506
01:01:15,040 --> 01:01:16,074
We ate it all.

1507
01:01:16,074 --> 01:01:17,374
(They finished the pancake appetizer in an instant)

1508
01:01:18,474 --> 01:01:19,607
It's meat.

1509
01:01:19,807 --> 01:01:21,774
- It's huge. / - That must be good.

1510
01:01:21,774 --> 01:01:23,407
It looks amazing.

1511
01:01:23,707 --> 01:01:24,974
Look at her eyes.

1512
01:01:24,974 --> 01:01:25,940
It looks so good.

1513
01:01:25,940 --> 01:01:28,174
I didn't know it was in there.

1514
01:01:28,174 --> 01:01:29,707
(Huge)

1515
01:01:29,807 --> 01:01:31,807
- Is it a boiled beef slice? / - Boiled beef.

1516
01:01:31,807 --> 01:01:34,207
They serve one piece for each person.

1517
01:01:34,874 --> 01:01:36,907
- Gosh, look at that. / - It looks delicious.

1518
01:01:36,907 --> 01:01:38,140
It looks great.

1519
01:01:38,140 --> 01:01:40,174
(Spinach and potato)

1520
01:01:40,707 --> 01:01:42,574
(Something catches Wendy's eyes)

1521
01:01:42,574 --> 01:01:44,174
- Did you eat bone marrow? / - Bone marrow?

1522
01:01:44,174 --> 01:01:45,340
With that...

1523
01:01:45,540 --> 01:01:46,774
- You should spread it on bread. / - Right.

1524
01:01:46,774 --> 01:01:50,407
(It has marrow in the round bone)

1525
01:01:50,907 --> 01:01:52,140
That's how they eat it.

1526
01:01:52,140 --> 01:01:53,774
(You spread it on bread)

1527
01:01:53,774 --> 01:01:57,240
- Is it real bone marrow? / - Yes.

1528
01:01:57,240 --> 01:01:58,374
It melts in your mouth.

1529
01:01:58,374 --> 01:01:59,574
They eat it like that?

1530
01:01:59,740 --> 01:02:03,307
(Seulgi tries it first)

1531
01:02:12,107 --> 01:02:13,274
It's fat.

1532
01:02:13,540 --> 01:02:14,707
- Is it fat? / - Yes.

1533
01:02:14,707 --> 01:02:16,174
The bread is very hard.

1534
01:02:16,174 --> 01:02:18,307
And it becomes soft with this.

1535
01:02:19,507 --> 01:02:22,340
I think people eat it when the weather is cold.

1536
01:02:22,340 --> 01:02:23,474
It's a healthy dish.

1537
01:02:23,474 --> 01:02:26,874
It's the most unaccustomed food I've seen.

1538
01:02:26,874 --> 01:02:29,140
It looks unfamiliar but it tastes familiar.

1539
01:02:29,574 --> 01:02:31,274
Try some of it.

1540
01:02:33,840 --> 01:02:35,374
Mommy.

1541
01:02:35,374 --> 01:02:36,174
I can't even imagine

1542
01:02:36,174 --> 01:02:39,074
what it tastes like, unlike other dishes.

1543
01:02:39,074 --> 01:02:40,174
How does it taste?

1544
01:02:40,174 --> 01:02:42,407
(She takes a bite of it)

1545
01:02:43,007 --> 01:02:45,407
(What do you think?)

1546
01:02:49,640 --> 01:02:51,207
(Mmm!)

1547
01:02:51,474 --> 01:02:53,740
- It's good. / - No, her eyes didn't get bigger.

1548
01:02:53,740 --> 01:02:55,840
- Her eyes didn't get bigger. / - Didn't get big.

1549
01:02:55,840 --> 01:02:57,840
She opens her eyes big when it's good.

1550
01:02:57,840 --> 01:03:01,507
The thing is, I don't like greasy and heavy food.

1551
01:03:01,574 --> 01:03:03,940
It tastes like soft butter.

1552
01:03:04,240 --> 01:03:07,274
- You don't like mushy texture. / - But it was good.

1553
01:03:07,340 --> 01:03:08,374
I like it.

1554
01:03:09,707 --> 01:03:12,107
There isn't much of it.

1555
01:03:12,974 --> 01:03:14,174
Which one?

1556
01:03:14,174 --> 01:03:15,840
You seem to really like that.

1557
01:03:18,274 --> 01:03:19,374
It's good.

1558
01:03:20,574 --> 01:03:24,807
(It's time to taste the meat)

1559
01:03:24,807 --> 01:03:26,174
Look at the grain.

1560
01:03:28,940 --> 01:03:31,274
How does it taste? Her eyes will get big, right?

1561
01:03:31,274 --> 01:03:32,174
It must be good.

1562
01:03:32,174 --> 01:03:34,040
Beef loin is really good.

1563
01:03:34,374 --> 01:03:35,474
It's very tender.

1564
01:03:38,174 --> 01:03:39,774
- It must be good. / - Seulgi likes it.

1565
01:03:39,774 --> 01:03:41,074
This is amazing.

1566
01:03:41,807 --> 01:03:43,840
I thought it'd be tough.

1567
01:03:45,340 --> 01:03:46,607
It's so tender.

1568
01:03:46,840 --> 01:03:48,607
- It looks like boiled beef. / - The potato looks good.

1569
01:03:48,607 --> 01:03:49,707
It was really tender.

1570
01:03:49,707 --> 01:03:52,007
- The spinach was so good. / - The spinach.

1571
01:03:55,040 --> 01:03:56,407
I like that it's a big serving.

1572
01:03:59,840 --> 01:04:01,374
This is like wasabi.

1573
01:04:03,240 --> 01:04:04,107
What's that?

1574
01:04:04,107 --> 01:04:05,840
It's a sauce made with ground radish and apple.

1575
01:04:05,840 --> 01:04:07,474
- That looks good. / - That looks good.

1576
01:04:07,640 --> 01:04:09,274
It must be sweet.

1577
01:04:09,274 --> 01:04:10,774
I think it'll taste unique.

1578
01:04:15,074 --> 01:04:16,807
- Her eyes went big. It's good. / - That's the best one.

1579
01:04:16,807 --> 01:04:17,840
I like this.

1580
01:04:18,974 --> 01:04:20,040
It's good because of the apple.

1581
01:04:20,040 --> 01:04:21,940
And the radish tastes refreshing.

1582
01:04:21,940 --> 01:04:23,140
It's cold.

1583
01:04:23,274 --> 01:04:24,840
- This is my style. / - This one?

1584
01:04:24,840 --> 01:04:27,374
It's like cold buckwheat noodles with ground radish.

1585
01:04:27,374 --> 01:04:28,307
It tastes like that.

1586
01:04:28,307 --> 01:04:32,074
And it's sweet and sour because of the apple.

1587
01:04:35,040 --> 01:04:36,940
It tasted even better with the meat.

1588
01:04:36,940 --> 01:04:41,040
(They start eating the meat in their own style)

1589
01:04:45,340 --> 01:04:47,107
- Amazing. / - It's so good.

1590
01:04:47,807 --> 01:04:48,874
It's so good.

1591
01:04:49,140 --> 01:04:50,740
I ate everything too.

1592
01:04:51,040 --> 01:04:54,107
The last course that we've been looking forward to...

1593
01:04:54,640 --> 01:04:55,407
Is left now.

1594
01:04:55,407 --> 01:04:58,107
We will see the night view for the last time.

1595
01:04:58,107 --> 01:04:59,074
You like night views, right?

1596
01:04:59,074 --> 01:05:00,574
I love night views.

1597
01:05:00,574 --> 01:05:03,640
Let's go to a hidden spot for night view...

1598
01:05:03,640 --> 01:05:06,007
- That I found. / - A night view.

1599
01:05:06,007 --> 01:05:07,674
- Yes. / - We can't leave that out.

1600
01:05:07,674 --> 01:05:11,640
That place appeared in the movie, "Before Sunrise."

1601
01:05:11,640 --> 01:05:13,107
She keeps talking about "Before Sunrise."

1602
01:05:13,107 --> 01:05:15,940
- We went there. / - I wish she would stop.

1603
01:05:15,940 --> 01:05:17,807
She must have really wanted to do things like that.

1604
01:05:17,807 --> 01:05:19,940
Seulgi has a big dream.

1605
01:05:19,940 --> 01:05:21,840
She wants to go there alone and return as a couple.

1606
01:05:23,274 --> 01:05:25,274
- That's ambitious. / - Hey.

1607
01:05:25,274 --> 01:05:26,874
Come to your senses.

1608
01:05:28,107 --> 01:05:29,540
She got scolded.

1609
01:05:29,540 --> 01:05:34,740
(Where the main characters whispered love to each other)

1610
01:05:42,440 --> 01:05:46,507
We had so much food. Did you digest some of that?

1611
01:05:46,840 --> 01:05:48,740
That's the opera house.

1612
01:05:49,307 --> 01:05:51,940
The building is so beautiful.

1613
01:05:52,507 --> 01:05:54,574
Doesn't it obviously look like it's

1614
01:05:54,574 --> 01:05:57,140
a building related to art?

1615
01:05:57,140 --> 01:05:59,407
- It's the opera house. / - It's so beautiful.

1616
01:05:59,407 --> 01:06:02,640
(1 of the top 3 opera houses worldwide)

1617
01:06:02,640 --> 01:06:08,074
You can go inside and watch the performances

1618
01:06:08,074 --> 01:06:09,874
but they broadcast the performances live outside

1619
01:06:09,874 --> 01:06:10,940
for people who can't go.

1620
01:06:10,940 --> 01:06:12,640
- They're doing it right now. / - Right?

1621
01:06:12,640 --> 01:06:14,007
That was so nice.

1622
01:06:14,007 --> 01:06:17,240
- They broadcast it like that. / - Yes, you can watch.

1623
01:06:17,607 --> 01:06:19,140
People stood outside and watched.

1624
01:06:19,140 --> 01:06:20,640
- It's the city of music. / - You have to see it.

1625
01:06:20,640 --> 01:06:23,974
You have to see it at the opera house.

1626
01:06:24,207 --> 01:06:27,007
We haven't eaten that yet.

1627
01:06:27,007 --> 01:06:28,474
- What? / - Max.

1628
01:06:28,474 --> 01:06:31,574
The sausage that Max recommended for us.

1629
01:06:32,207 --> 01:06:34,874
(The man they met at the art gallery)

1630
01:06:36,374 --> 01:06:37,707
(Austrian sausage)

1631
01:06:37,707 --> 01:06:38,774
Austrian sausage.

1632
01:06:39,840 --> 01:06:42,874
How about eating that sausage...

1633
01:06:43,374 --> 01:06:45,674
- With beer... / - With beer?

1634
01:06:45,674 --> 01:06:47,640
And enjoy the night view?

1635
01:06:48,574 --> 01:06:51,074
Are those traffic lights over there...

1636
01:06:52,074 --> 01:06:53,940
- Shaped like a couple? / - Yes, it looks like a couple.

1637
01:06:55,040 --> 01:06:56,374
It's a couple.

1638
01:06:56,374 --> 01:06:59,007
- All of them are like this. / - They're all...

1639
01:06:59,007 --> 01:07:00,974
- Two people. / - It's so pretty.

1640
01:07:01,140 --> 01:07:04,140
Some have men holding hands.

1641
01:07:04,140 --> 01:07:05,874
There are ones riding bikes.

1642
01:07:05,874 --> 01:07:08,740
There are various ones with men and women.

1643
01:07:08,740 --> 01:07:10,840
It's so pretty. It's cute.

1644
01:07:10,840 --> 01:07:13,674
- It has a heart. / - We took photos of all of them.

1645
01:07:13,807 --> 01:07:17,107
They're holding hands and it's two women.

1646
01:07:17,107 --> 01:07:18,840
(Fascinated)

1647
01:07:18,840 --> 01:07:21,207
It really is a woman with another woman.

1648
01:07:21,207 --> 01:07:22,474
That's fascinating.

1649
01:07:23,007 --> 01:07:23,874
This must be the place.

1650
01:07:23,874 --> 01:07:25,374
There are a lot of people eating here.

1651
01:07:25,374 --> 01:07:26,740
- Is this the place? / - Yes.

1652
01:07:27,707 --> 01:07:29,240
The sausage here is famous.

1653
01:07:29,240 --> 01:07:33,707
(Sausage restaurant right next to the opera house)

1654
01:07:34,374 --> 01:07:37,374
Where's the line? Is this all the line?

1655
01:07:38,174 --> 01:07:40,007
- Food on the street is the best. / - It's delicious.

1656
01:07:40,007 --> 01:07:42,540
I think it's also popular because of the location.

1657
01:07:42,540 --> 01:07:44,774
- It's next to the opera house. / - You're right.

1658
01:07:44,774 --> 01:07:46,974
- That's why he recommended here. / - I think so too.

1659
01:07:46,974 --> 01:07:49,974
You come here to eat before the opera.

1660
01:07:49,974 --> 01:07:52,974
You come here to eat again after the opera.

1661
01:07:52,974 --> 01:07:54,474
That's why people are flocked here.

1662
01:07:54,474 --> 01:07:57,607
There aren't a lot of places that are open

1663
01:07:57,607 --> 01:07:59,007
until late in Austria.

1664
01:07:59,007 --> 01:08:04,074
But this place opens at 8 a.m. and closes at 4 a.m.

1665
01:08:04,674 --> 01:08:07,540
You could come here to have a meal,

1666
01:08:07,540 --> 01:08:08,274
you could have this with a drink

1667
01:08:08,274 --> 01:08:10,640
or you could cure your hangover.

1668
01:08:10,640 --> 01:08:12,074
- I wanted to try that. / - Yes.

1669
01:08:12,074 --> 01:08:13,740
- Can we have that one, please? / - Yes.

1670
01:08:13,740 --> 01:08:15,540
- Sliced or in a bun? / - Sliced.

1671
01:08:15,540 --> 01:08:17,307
I really want to try that sausage.

1672
01:08:21,774 --> 01:08:24,640
(The sausages, $5.40)

1673
01:08:24,640 --> 01:08:27,707
They finally get to eat Vienna sausages.

1674
01:08:29,074 --> 01:08:31,007
- Let's go. / - Let's go.

1675
01:08:31,007 --> 01:08:33,274
That's it.

1676
01:08:33,274 --> 01:08:34,307
This is the place.

1677
01:08:34,307 --> 01:08:36,274
I think it has various kinds of drinks since

1678
01:08:36,274 --> 01:08:38,274
it does business until the morning.

1679
01:08:38,274 --> 01:08:40,074
- She's excited. / - This is the place.

1680
01:08:40,074 --> 01:08:41,040
- They found it. / - This is the point.

1681
01:08:41,040 --> 01:08:43,507
- Really? I don't recall. / - Yes.

1682
01:08:43,774 --> 01:08:45,340
(If you go up to the 2nd floor of the Albertina)

1683
01:08:45,340 --> 01:08:47,007
- It's right above the sausage place. / - Okay.

1684
01:08:47,007 --> 01:08:49,340
It's so beautiful there.

1685
01:08:49,340 --> 01:08:51,207
- Excuse me, Hyorim. / - Sorry.

1686
01:08:51,207 --> 01:08:52,807
Hyorim, you're doing a good job.

1687
01:08:54,274 --> 01:08:59,674
(The main characters whispered love here)

1688
01:09:04,874 --> 01:09:07,774
(The night view of Vienna makes you feel warm)

1689
01:09:07,774 --> 01:09:09,674
All the buildings are pretty.

1690
01:09:09,674 --> 01:09:10,807
Europe has this kind of charm.

1691
01:09:10,807 --> 01:09:12,174
You continue without knowing how

1692
01:09:12,174 --> 01:09:13,774
the time passes by.

1693
01:09:13,774 --> 01:09:17,174
You don't have to do anything. You can just be dazed.

1694
01:09:20,407 --> 01:09:22,140
It's so pretty, isn't it?

1695
01:09:23,040 --> 01:09:26,774
I think the wind and everything is perfect.

1696
01:09:26,774 --> 01:09:30,207
(Everything, even the fresh wind, is perfect here)

1697
01:09:31,974 --> 01:09:34,340
- Let's eat this. / - Yes, it's getting cold.

1698
01:09:34,507 --> 01:09:36,440
Eat this with beer.

1699
01:09:36,440 --> 01:09:38,807
Let's see how good the sausages are.

1700
01:09:38,807 --> 01:09:39,640
(She takes the beer out of her bag)

1701
01:09:41,174 --> 01:09:42,174
She's so cute.

1702
01:09:42,174 --> 01:09:44,574
Can you drink outside?

1703
01:09:44,574 --> 01:09:45,940
- Yes. / - Yes.

1704
01:09:45,940 --> 01:09:47,607
I'm jealous of people who live here.

1705
01:09:47,607 --> 01:09:52,074
They can always have sausages and beer here.

1706
01:09:52,074 --> 01:09:53,907
(The last part of the tour with sausages and beer)

1707
01:09:54,374 --> 01:09:55,807
Cheers.

1708
01:09:58,007 --> 01:10:01,174
Wendy is almost on Sikyung's level.

1709
01:10:02,640 --> 01:10:04,374
I met my long lost sister.

1710
01:10:13,074 --> 01:10:15,407
- It's nice. / - It's nice.

1711
01:10:16,040 --> 01:10:19,074
We have to eat the sausages with beer.

1712
01:10:19,374 --> 01:10:20,874
Have one.

1713
01:10:22,540 --> 01:10:25,807
(Yum)

1714
01:10:27,440 --> 01:10:28,674
It's good.

1715
01:10:28,940 --> 01:10:31,074
I think it's the perfect pairing.

1716
01:10:32,540 --> 01:10:34,440
Make me blend into the background.

1717
01:10:35,507 --> 01:10:37,340
- You'll surely blend in. / - Yes.

1718
01:10:37,874 --> 01:10:39,607
You look pretty since you're not showing your face.

1719
01:10:39,907 --> 01:10:40,907
Am I pretty?

1720
01:10:40,907 --> 01:10:44,707
(They are immersed in "Before Sunrise")

1721
01:10:44,707 --> 01:10:45,874
How should I take the photo?

1722
01:10:47,774 --> 01:10:48,840
(I'm the main character of "Before Sunrise")

1723
01:10:48,840 --> 01:10:50,840
It's so pretty.

1724
01:10:50,840 --> 01:10:52,940
- Photo of a life time. / - Yes.

1725
01:10:52,940 --> 01:10:54,540
Ethan Hawke was sitting here.

1726
01:10:55,840 --> 01:10:58,507
Julie Delpy was here.

1727
01:10:59,240 --> 01:11:01,007
Can't we imitate...

1728
01:11:01,407 --> 01:11:04,240
That scene from the movie?

1729
01:11:04,907 --> 01:11:06,240
Just the two of you?

1730
01:11:06,240 --> 01:11:07,474
You have to do that.

1731
01:11:07,474 --> 01:11:08,874
They're doing it.

1732
01:11:16,607 --> 01:11:18,607
Hi, dude. What's up?

1733
01:11:18,974 --> 01:11:21,174
(Seulgi Delpy)

1734
01:11:21,174 --> 01:11:22,307
Seulgi Delpy.

1735
01:11:24,074 --> 01:11:25,140
Yeah.

1736
01:11:25,307 --> 01:11:28,507
(Wendy Hawke)

1737
01:11:28,640 --> 01:11:33,940
(Their fateful encounter started on a train)

1738
01:11:36,074 --> 01:11:39,240
I feel like this is some dream world we're in.

1739
01:11:39,240 --> 01:11:41,640
- You know? / - Yeah, it's so weird.

1740
01:11:46,974 --> 01:11:50,874
I feel like this is some dream world we're in.

1741
01:11:51,774 --> 01:11:53,774
It's so weird.

1742
01:11:54,840 --> 01:11:57,240
It's like our time together is just ours.

1743
01:11:57,840 --> 01:11:59,774
They're so serious.

1744
01:11:59,774 --> 01:12:01,607
- This is embarrassing. / - We won.

1745
01:12:02,274 --> 01:12:03,974
It's our own creation.

1746
01:12:05,807 --> 01:12:09,007
It must be like I'm in your dream and you in mine...

1747
01:12:10,474 --> 01:12:14,474
(Seulgi Delpy smiles)

1748
01:12:15,174 --> 01:12:17,440
(Looks at her with mellow eyes)

1749
01:12:17,440 --> 01:12:18,807
(She couldn't contain her laughter)

1750
01:12:18,807 --> 01:12:20,240
Let's stop here.

1751
01:12:21,307 --> 01:12:23,440
Good job. Let's go.

1752
01:12:23,874 --> 01:12:24,907
Let's go.

1753
01:12:26,274 --> 01:12:27,340
Let's go.

1754
01:12:30,474 --> 01:12:35,774
(The Vienna trip Seulgi designed also ends here)

1755
01:12:36,874 --> 01:12:38,907
- Are you ready? / - I am.

1756
01:12:38,907 --> 01:12:40,407
Let's enjoy to the fullest!

1757
01:12:40,407 --> 01:12:41,240
Let's go!

1758
01:12:41,240 --> 01:12:42,707
- This is it. / - This is it.

1759
01:12:42,707 --> 01:12:45,307
It finally feels like Austria now.

1760
01:12:47,140 --> 01:12:49,907
- ??Blue sky, blue sky dream ??/ - No, no.

1761
01:12:49,907 --> 01:12:51,740
You should sing... ??Do, re, mi ??

1762
01:12:53,040 --> 01:12:54,474
Yes, you should sing that song.

1763
01:12:54,474 --> 01:12:56,974
I can't believe some people see this every day.

1764
01:12:56,974 --> 01:12:57,740
I want to live here.

1765
01:12:58,140 --> 01:12:59,340
Isn't it nice?

1766
01:12:59,340 --> 01:13:00,607
The colors are so pretty.

1767
01:13:00,607 --> 01:13:01,774
It's like a movie set.

1768
01:13:01,774 --> 01:13:03,840
Go, go, go.

1769
01:13:04,840 --> 01:13:06,307
You went paragliding?

1770
01:13:06,307 --> 01:13:09,007
(How to enjoy the small town in a more thrilling way)

1771
01:13:09,007 --> 01:13:10,707
We're flying!

1772
01:13:10,707 --> 01:13:12,807
Everything is just perfect.

1773
01:13:12,807 --> 01:13:15,807
The world seemed even more beautiful.

1774
01:13:19,140 --> 01:13:22,174
We enjoyed it. We have to mention the rib soup.

1775
01:13:22,174 --> 01:13:24,574
Is the rib soup a traditional food of Austria?

1776
01:13:24,574 --> 01:13:26,974
Yes, it has a long history.

1777
01:13:26,974 --> 01:13:28,540
- Is it not a fusion dish? / - No.

1778
01:13:28,540 --> 01:13:30,340
Isn't the color and everything similar

1779
01:13:30,340 --> 01:13:31,674
to Korea's rib soup?

1780
01:13:31,674 --> 01:13:32,707
What did the meat taste like?

1781
01:13:32,707 --> 01:13:35,540
- We usually think that rump is tough. / - The buttocks.

1782
01:13:35,540 --> 01:13:36,740
It's not tough at all.

1783
01:13:36,740 --> 01:13:41,074
Since we had it with soup, it was so tender.

1784
01:13:41,074 --> 01:13:43,840
It had a light taste and with vegetables like spinach,

1785
01:13:43,840 --> 01:13:46,440
potatoes, radishes and apples...

1786
01:13:46,440 --> 01:13:48,174
- You could eat it in many ways. / - The sauces.

1787
01:13:48,174 --> 01:13:50,574
- It was so delicious. / - Will Koreans like it?

1788
01:13:50,574 --> 01:13:53,840
- Yes. / - Just think of it as Korean rib soup.

1789
01:13:53,840 --> 01:13:55,407
- Really? / - You can enjoy it.

1790
01:13:55,407 --> 01:13:58,707
We ate that when we started to miss Korean food

1791
01:13:58,707 --> 01:13:59,807
and it took care of that craving completely.

1792
01:13:59,807 --> 01:14:02,640
We always eat our food with soup.

1793
01:14:02,640 --> 01:14:05,707
- The traffic lights are impressive. / - Yes.

1794
01:14:05,707 --> 01:14:08,007
Is it that diverse? Are all traffic lights different?

1795
01:14:08,007 --> 01:14:10,740
Yes. It aims to decrease prejudice against gender

1796
01:14:10,740 --> 01:14:12,907
and disability, and respect diversity.

1797
01:14:12,907 --> 01:14:15,474
That's why they installed traffic lights like that.

1798
01:14:15,474 --> 01:14:16,940
That's why there were men with men...

1799
01:14:16,940 --> 01:14:18,640
- And women with women. / - That's right.

1800
01:14:18,640 --> 01:14:20,607
- There was also men with women. / - Yes.

1801
01:14:20,607 --> 01:14:21,940
How was the acting really like?

1802
01:14:21,940 --> 01:14:22,640
It seemed like Wendy couldn't stand it.

1803
01:14:22,640 --> 01:14:24,107
- Please tell us about your acting. / - Yes.

1804
01:14:24,107 --> 01:14:25,440
Seulgi must have been satisfied.

1805
01:14:25,440 --> 01:14:27,207
- I really like the movie. / - Yes.

1806
01:14:27,207 --> 01:14:30,240
- Of course, she was satisfied. / - It's meaningful...

1807
01:14:30,240 --> 01:14:33,740
- That I could do it with Wendy. / - I see.

1808
01:14:33,740 --> 01:14:36,574
What was that?

1809
01:14:37,274 --> 01:14:39,540
- Let's hear their last thoughts. / - Yes.

1810
01:14:39,540 --> 01:14:41,840
Seulgi, please tell us your last thoughts.

1811
01:14:42,307 --> 01:14:44,374
The night view is more splendid

1812
01:14:44,374 --> 01:14:46,807
than what we saw in the movies.

1813
01:14:46,807 --> 01:14:49,874
There is food that even Koreans could eat easily.

1814
01:14:49,874 --> 01:14:51,640
You can do all that in Vienna.

1815
01:14:51,974 --> 01:14:53,107
Everything you see is art

1816
01:14:53,107 --> 01:14:55,040
and everything you encounter is history.

1817
01:14:55,040 --> 01:14:58,707
This place even has the trendiness of Europe.

1818
01:14:58,707 --> 01:15:01,940
Is this a rap? No, right?

1819
01:15:01,940 --> 01:15:03,474
Everything you see is art and everything...

1820
01:15:03,474 --> 01:15:06,174
- You encounter is history. / - I wasn't rapping.

1821
01:15:06,174 --> 01:15:08,240
That's a rap, isn't it? Could you do it one more time?

1822
01:15:08,940 --> 01:15:10,507
Everything you see is art and

1823
01:15:10,507 --> 01:15:12,507

1826
