00:00:00,308 --> 00:00:02,141
(Numerous great tips on trips) 

2
00:00:03,441 --> 00:00:04,808
(Kim Sook, Sung Sikyung) 

3
00:00:05,341 --> 00:00:06,741
(Lee Hwijae, special host, Hur Youngji) 

4
00:00:06,741 --> 00:00:08,174
Travel is war. 

5
00:00:08,174 --> 00:00:10,574
Battle Trip! 

6
00:00:13,508 --> 00:00:14,841
(They are cheering very loudly today) 

7
00:00:14,841 --> 00:00:16,941
- It's like an army base. / - It's so loud. 

8
00:00:16,941 --> 00:00:18,608
Are we at a military camp or what? 

9
00:00:18,608 --> 00:00:20,308
Is it because of today's special host? 

10
00:00:20,308 --> 00:00:22,808
I think so. Everyone, our special host, Hur Youngji. 

11
00:00:22,808 --> 00:00:24,074
(Hur Youngji will be the special host for 2 weeks) 

12
00:00:24,508 --> 00:00:25,408
(Make some noise) 

13
00:00:25,408 --> 00:00:27,174
This doesn't happen in our show. This is weird. 

14
00:00:27,174 --> 00:00:28,708
Really? It's not usually like this? 

15
00:00:28,708 --> 00:00:30,474
- They just applaud like this. / - It's different with you. 

16
00:00:30,474 --> 00:00:31,974
Thank you. 

17
00:00:31,974 --> 00:00:34,208
- Do you like to travel? / - I love to travel. 

18
00:00:34,208 --> 00:00:36,641
- But I haven't traveled a lot. / - Oh, no. 

19
00:00:36,641 --> 00:00:39,674
- You're too busy. / - I'd like to go on more trips. 

20
00:00:39,674 --> 00:00:42,008
Now that I'm the special host here, 

21
00:00:42,008 --> 00:00:44,208
I want to get a lot of good tips. 

22
00:00:44,208 --> 00:00:46,308
And I heard she loves to eat. 

23
00:00:46,308 --> 00:00:47,908
- She does love to eat. / - She can go on a trip and... 

24
00:00:47,908 --> 00:00:50,541
Where did you recently travel? Who did you go with? 

25
00:00:50,541 --> 00:00:52,874
With my older sister. 

26
00:00:52,874 --> 00:00:53,808
Not too long ago. 

27
00:00:53,808 --> 00:00:56,274
- Why? Am I being too tactless? / - It's so obvious. 

28
00:00:56,274 --> 00:00:57,574
Why would she travel with her sister 

29
00:00:57,574 --> 00:00:58,641
when she has a boyfriend? 

30
00:00:59,508 --> 00:01:01,308
She should travel with her sister. 

31
00:01:01,308 --> 00:01:03,008
- Where did you go? / - With my sister... 

32
00:01:03,008 --> 00:01:05,774
- I went to Hong Kong. / - Hong Kong. 

33
00:01:05,774 --> 00:01:06,708
How was it? 

34
00:01:06,708 --> 00:01:08,608
My sister did a good job of planning the trip. 

35
00:01:08,608 --> 00:01:12,274
- That sounds nice. / - Is "sister" his pet name? 

36
00:01:12,274 --> 00:01:14,174
(His pet name is sister?) 

37
00:01:14,174 --> 00:01:15,674
No. 

38
00:01:15,674 --> 00:01:18,441
She wouldn't call her boyfriend "sister." 

39
00:01:18,441 --> 00:01:19,574
It sounds sweet. 

40
00:01:19,574 --> 00:01:22,141
No, I even posted my photos on my social media. 

41
00:01:22,141 --> 00:01:26,008
Sisters go on trips together a lot. 

42
00:01:26,008 --> 00:01:27,308
We used to fight a lot when we were young. 

43
00:01:27,308 --> 00:01:28,874
But after we grew up, 

44
00:01:28,874 --> 00:01:30,108
we became the best friends. 

45
00:01:30,108 --> 00:01:34,174
I went to New York with my sister 10 years ago. 

46
00:01:34,408 --> 00:01:36,608
And she still talks about it. 

47
00:01:36,941 --> 00:01:38,008
Because it still remains in her memory. 

48
00:01:38,008 --> 00:01:40,008
We haven't gone anywhere since then, 

49
00:01:40,008 --> 00:01:41,708
so she just keeps talking about that trip. 

50
00:01:41,708 --> 00:01:44,674
- I guess she loved the trip. / - As you get old... 

51
00:01:44,674 --> 00:01:46,641
You feel the most comfortable around your family. 

52
00:01:46,641 --> 00:01:48,874
- We sometimes have a fight. / - Right. 

53
00:01:48,874 --> 00:01:50,008
But it just feels comfortable. 

54
00:01:50,008 --> 00:01:51,408
- The fight doesn't last long. / - You know each other. 

55
00:01:51,408 --> 00:01:53,441
And the memory is unforgettable. 

56
00:01:53,441 --> 00:01:55,808
So for the first time in Battle Trip, 

57
00:01:55,808 --> 00:01:58,208
we had real sisters go on a trip together. 

58
00:01:58,208 --> 00:01:59,774
It's our first time to have real sisters here. 

59
00:01:59,774 --> 00:02:00,841
- It's our first time. / - I see. 

60
00:02:00,841 --> 00:02:02,874
Let's meet today's trip planners then. 

61
00:02:02,874 --> 00:02:04,308
- Please come on out. / - Please come on out. 

62
00:02:04,308 --> 00:02:05,441
(Who are the trip planners?) 

63
00:02:07,641 --> 00:02:09,108
(Mijoo and Jisoo of Lovelyz) 

64
00:02:10,474 --> 00:02:11,774
(Yang Heeeun, Yang Heekyeong) 

65
00:02:11,774 --> 00:02:12,874
So pretty. 

66
00:02:14,441 --> 00:02:17,308
Since when did you have so many male fans? 

67
00:02:17,308 --> 00:02:19,541
- I guess your entire fan club is here. / - Right. 

68
00:02:19,541 --> 00:02:21,208
- How have you been? / - How have you been? 

69
00:02:21,208 --> 00:02:23,574
I heard if you eat rice rolls in your car, you're an idol. 

70
00:02:23,574 --> 00:02:25,741
- That's right. / - You're an idol, right? 

71
00:02:25,841 --> 00:02:27,041
I recently 

72
00:02:27,041 --> 00:02:29,841
worked with Sikyung for my new song. 

73
00:02:29,841 --> 00:02:32,541
And it's been well received by the public 

74
00:02:32,541 --> 00:02:35,308
since the moment it was released. 

75
00:02:35,308 --> 00:02:38,074
I'm having concerts in many big cities... 

76
00:02:38,074 --> 00:02:40,374
- Until the end of the year. / - She's amazing. 

77
00:02:40,741 --> 00:02:44,708
Win or lose, I think their trips will be a lot of fun 

78
00:02:44,708 --> 00:02:49,441
because Heeeun has so much travel experience. 

79
00:02:49,441 --> 00:02:50,808
She is really amazing. 

80
00:02:50,808 --> 00:02:52,741
Sometimes I ask her how she is doing, 

81
00:02:52,741 --> 00:02:54,674
and she says, "I went to Iceland." 

82
00:02:54,674 --> 00:02:56,441
- "I went to Japan." / - I know. 

83
00:02:56,441 --> 00:02:58,674
She's been everywhere. 

84
00:02:58,674 --> 00:03:01,574
- Do you often travel together? / - Of course. 

85
00:03:01,574 --> 00:03:04,008
Do you guys get along well on a trip? 

86
00:03:04,008 --> 00:03:06,674
We've been compatible since we were young. 

87
00:03:07,541 --> 00:03:09,441
We are very different but compatible. 

88
00:03:09,441 --> 00:03:11,374
And Heeeun takes the lead most of the time. 

89
00:03:12,008 --> 00:03:13,841
I just follow her lead 

90
00:03:13,841 --> 00:03:16,341
and let her make plans for our trip. 

91
00:03:16,341 --> 00:03:18,808
We have very different traveling styles, 

92
00:03:18,808 --> 00:03:21,041
so I mostly follow her. 

93
00:03:21,041 --> 00:03:22,274
What's the biggest difference? 

94
00:03:22,574 --> 00:03:25,141
She eats breakfast first thing in the morning 

95
00:03:25,141 --> 00:03:27,908
but I skip breakfast. 

96
00:03:27,908 --> 00:03:29,308
After breakfast, 

97
00:03:29,308 --> 00:03:32,008
she goes out immediately and travels around all day. 

98
00:03:32,008 --> 00:03:34,008
- Heeeun does that? / - She is fit. 

99
00:03:34,008 --> 00:03:37,208
And I follow her gasping. 

100
00:03:37,208 --> 00:03:40,208
I once took a trip with Heeeun. 

101
00:03:40,208 --> 00:03:41,308
During the trip, 

102
00:03:41,308 --> 00:03:44,341
she woke up at around 6 and had breakfast. 

103
00:03:44,574 --> 00:03:46,774
- I was so tired. / - It's like fuelling up. 

104
00:03:46,774 --> 00:03:48,174
So... 

105
00:03:48,174 --> 00:03:49,341
I even pretended to be asleep. 

106
00:03:50,141 --> 00:03:51,541
- You didn't want to wake up? / - Right. 

107
00:03:51,541 --> 00:03:52,974
You wanted to sleep. 

108
00:03:52,974 --> 00:03:55,074
Even though we are different, 

109
00:03:55,074 --> 00:03:56,674
she never forces me to follow her. 

110
00:03:56,674 --> 00:03:59,041
That's why you can go on trips together. 

111
00:03:59,041 --> 00:04:02,274
Have you guys been on a trip together? 

112
00:04:02,274 --> 00:04:04,508
- We've never been together before. / - I knew it. 

113
00:04:04,508 --> 00:04:05,874
Let's be honest. You two aren't that close, right? 

114
00:04:05,874 --> 00:04:07,141
We're close. 

115
00:04:07,141 --> 00:04:09,508
- We are just too busy. / - They don't have time. 

116
00:04:09,508 --> 00:04:10,941
So this was your first trip together? 

117
00:04:10,941 --> 00:04:11,874
Yes, it was. 

118
00:04:11,874 --> 00:04:13,708
- You two must've fought a lot. / - Yeah. 

119
00:04:13,708 --> 00:04:16,708
I was worried because we both are quite noisy. 

120
00:04:17,074 --> 00:04:18,174
You two are noisy? 

121
00:04:18,174 --> 00:04:20,841
- Do you guys chat until you fall asleep? / - Yes. 

122
00:04:20,841 --> 00:04:23,108
We use up all our energy and just fall sound asleep. 

123
00:04:23,108 --> 00:04:24,208
(They are very passionate when they travel) 

124
00:04:24,208 --> 00:04:25,341
They're energetic. 

125
00:04:25,341 --> 00:04:27,341
You can expend energy by talking 

126
00:04:27,341 --> 00:04:28,741
or by moving around. 

127
00:04:28,741 --> 00:04:29,808
And I think they do both. 

128
00:04:29,808 --> 00:04:32,308
- That's true. / - We do both. 

129
00:04:32,308 --> 00:04:33,574
(Energetic) 

130
00:04:34,874 --> 00:04:36,608
- Wait. / - I should keep it down? 

131
00:04:36,608 --> 00:04:38,074
You should calm down a little. 

132
00:04:38,074 --> 00:04:40,974
So, did you two plan your trip together? 

133
00:04:40,974 --> 00:04:44,841
I looked for information on the internet. 

134
00:04:45,241 --> 00:04:46,774
But I just looked over it. 

135
00:04:46,774 --> 00:04:49,241
Because I don't want to copy exactly what they do. 

136
00:04:49,241 --> 00:04:52,341
Those who post about their trips are mostly young. 

137
00:04:52,341 --> 00:04:55,541
So their itinerary doesn't 

138
00:04:55,541 --> 00:04:57,141
quite work for me. 

139
00:04:57,141 --> 00:05:00,708
So, I just read various articles and sources 

140
00:05:00,708 --> 00:05:03,408
and put them together in my head. 

141
00:05:03,408 --> 00:05:06,241
Then I come up with my own plan. 

142
00:05:06,241 --> 00:05:08,341
When we take a trip together, she does the job. 

143
00:05:08,341 --> 00:05:10,308
But when I go with someone else, I do it. 

144
00:05:11,041 --> 00:05:12,541
Actually, this means a lot. 

145
00:05:12,541 --> 00:05:17,241
A lot of retired people in their 60s say... 

146
00:05:17,241 --> 00:05:20,208
They want to travel without the tour guide. 

147
00:05:20,208 --> 00:05:22,508
But they mostly take a package tour instead. 

148
00:05:22,508 --> 00:05:25,841
There's the so-called "senior backpackers" these days. 

149
00:05:25,841 --> 00:05:27,341
Finally, so... 

150
00:05:27,341 --> 00:05:31,608
It's not that only young people go on backpacking. 

151
00:05:31,608 --> 00:05:35,041
I want them to watch our trip carefully 

152
00:05:35,041 --> 00:05:38,041
and go on a trip with our itinerary... 

153
00:05:38,041 --> 00:05:39,741
- With a little courage. / - She's right. 

154
00:05:39,741 --> 00:05:42,508
- Anyone can go backpacking then. / - That's right. 

155
00:05:42,508 --> 00:05:44,508
I suppose you chose the destination 

156
00:05:44,508 --> 00:05:46,174
with certain standards in mind. 

157
00:05:46,174 --> 00:05:47,408
- Heeeun? / - Yes. 

158
00:05:47,408 --> 00:05:50,774
For me, I have certain standards in mind. 

159
00:05:50,774 --> 00:05:52,841
First of all, the flight time shouldn't be too long. 

160
00:05:52,841 --> 00:05:54,341
- You're right. / - Right. 

161
00:05:54,341 --> 00:05:57,308
And somewhere without too big a time difference. 

162
00:05:57,308 --> 00:05:59,241
- Just 1 or 2 hours. / - Otherwise it's too tiring. 

163
00:05:59,241 --> 00:06:01,541
- Next, the food has to be good too. / - Yes. 

164
00:06:01,541 --> 00:06:05,074
- Food is important. / - And it has to be cheap... 

165
00:06:05,074 --> 00:06:06,674
So that after we exchange the money, 

166
00:06:06,674 --> 00:06:09,041
we can enjoy spending it. 

167
00:06:09,041 --> 00:06:10,808
Somewhere I can be generous about money. 

168
00:06:10,808 --> 00:06:14,608
We tried to find a place that meets 

169
00:06:14,608 --> 00:06:15,508
all these conditions. 

170
00:06:15,508 --> 00:06:17,908
You've made good points. 

171
00:06:18,341 --> 00:06:21,574
- But is there such a place? / - There is. 

172
00:06:21,574 --> 00:06:22,641
China. 

173
00:06:22,641 --> 00:06:23,874
- China? / - China. 

174
00:06:23,874 --> 00:06:25,574
That makes sense. Japan is a little expensive. 

175
00:06:25,574 --> 00:06:27,208
- Exactly. / - That's why... 

176
00:06:27,341 --> 00:06:30,108
We went to the small Europe in China. 

177
00:06:30,108 --> 00:06:30,774
Europe? 

178
00:06:30,774 --> 00:06:32,308
It's where Chinese people 

179
00:06:32,308 --> 00:06:34,474
want to live the most after retirement. 

180
00:06:34,474 --> 00:06:36,541
- Where is it? / - It's a city in China. 

181
00:06:36,541 --> 00:06:38,341
- Xiamen. / - Xiamen. 

182
00:06:38,841 --> 00:06:39,808
Xiamen. 

183
00:06:40,974 --> 00:06:44,741
Xiamen is like Jeju-do for Chinese people. 

184
00:06:44,741 --> 00:06:46,941
- That's right. / - Many Chinese want to go there. 

185
00:06:46,941 --> 00:06:49,408
- It's a famous vacation spot. / - I see. 

186
00:06:49,841 --> 00:06:51,641
- How long was the flight? / - About 3 hours. 

187
00:06:51,641 --> 00:06:52,808
3 hours. 

188
00:06:52,808 --> 00:06:54,841
- 3 hours. / - And for people of our age... 

189
00:06:54,841 --> 00:06:57,341
It's very convenient to travel there. 

190
00:06:57,341 --> 00:06:59,408
Our generation learned Chinese characters. 

191
00:06:59,841 --> 00:07:02,108
We can read the signs and menus. 

192
00:07:02,108 --> 00:07:04,341
Although there are a lot of simplified characters, 

193
00:07:04,341 --> 00:07:05,841
we can still read most of them. 

194
00:07:06,541 --> 00:07:08,274
- It's not so hard. / - It's not hard for the elderly. 

195
00:07:08,274 --> 00:07:11,641
They have great food as well. 

196
00:07:11,641 --> 00:07:14,774
The food here especially suited our taste. 

197
00:07:14,774 --> 00:07:16,541
And the time difference is only one hour... 

198
00:07:16,541 --> 00:07:19,041
- Which meant no jet lag at all. / - No jet lag. 

199
00:07:19,041 --> 00:07:21,441
There are many buildings that are like those from... 

200
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:23,508
- Europe in the 19th century. / - There are? 

201
00:07:23,508 --> 00:07:26,741
It felt like we were in Europe, Southeast Asia, 

202
00:07:26,741 --> 00:07:29,508
Taiwan and China. 

203
00:07:29,508 --> 00:07:30,941
That's what it felt like. 

204
00:07:30,941 --> 00:07:33,374
- Alright then... / - This is going to be tough. 

205
00:07:33,374 --> 00:07:36,008
Jisoo and Mijoo of Lovelyz. 

206
00:07:36,008 --> 00:07:37,241
Where did you go? 

207
00:07:37,241 --> 00:07:39,441
We went to Taiwan. 

208
00:07:42,074 --> 00:07:44,108
Oh, no. Taiwanese food is delicious. 

209
00:07:44,108 --> 00:07:45,874
- I love Taiwan. / - In Taiwan... 

210
00:07:45,874 --> 00:07:47,674
There were so many delicious food. 

211
00:07:47,674 --> 00:07:50,141
We visited the hidden gem of southern Taiwan. 

212
00:07:50,141 --> 00:07:52,641
We went to the Hawaii and Jeju-do of Taiwan, Kenting. 

213
00:07:52,641 --> 00:07:53,708
- Kenting? / - Kenting. 

214
00:07:53,708 --> 00:07:54,841
I've never heard of Kenting. 

215
00:07:54,841 --> 00:07:56,441
- I have never heard of it either. / - Me neither. 

216
00:07:56,441 --> 00:07:58,274
I've heard of "renting" and "venting." 

217
00:08:00,941 --> 00:08:02,941
- Such a funny joke. / - Yes. 

218
00:08:03,341 --> 00:08:05,008
Is there a reason why you chose to go there? 

219
00:08:05,008 --> 00:08:06,241
Yes, there is. 

220
00:08:06,241 --> 00:08:10,008
Many people travel to Taiwan 

221
00:08:10,008 --> 00:08:12,574
but most of them just visit Taipei. 

222
00:08:12,574 --> 00:08:14,708
- You're right. / - And nearby cities. 

223
00:08:14,708 --> 00:08:17,208
But we wanted to visit the unknown places. 

224
00:08:17,208 --> 00:08:20,208
But we always ask why people don't go there. 

225
00:08:20,541 --> 00:08:21,941
There must be a reason. 

226
00:08:21,941 --> 00:08:24,408
- But this place was... / - Yes. 

227
00:08:24,841 --> 00:08:26,141
Amazing. 

228
00:08:26,141 --> 00:08:27,308
(Confident) 

229
00:08:27,974 --> 00:08:30,208
Could you tell us a little bit about it? 

230
00:08:30,208 --> 00:08:32,041
It was a nice place to travel. 

231
00:08:32,374 --> 00:08:33,374
It's a small city, 

232
00:08:33,374 --> 00:08:35,074
so you can look around the city on a scooter. 

233
00:08:35,741 --> 00:08:40,341
We wanted to look around the city on scooters but... 

234
00:08:40,341 --> 00:08:42,174
That's all I can say for now. 

235
00:08:42,174 --> 00:08:43,941
- But? / - But what? 

236
00:08:43,941 --> 00:08:45,208
It rained, right? 

237
00:08:45,674 --> 00:08:48,441
No, it was amazing. 

238
00:08:48,441 --> 00:08:49,608
Alright. 

239
00:08:49,608 --> 00:08:50,408
Good, good. 

240
00:08:50,408 --> 00:08:51,474
I'm curious. 

241
00:08:51,474 --> 00:08:53,808
On the count of 3... 

242
00:08:54,108 --> 00:08:56,074
It was amazing! 

243
00:08:56,241 --> 00:08:58,141
So, it's a match between Xiamen, China 

244
00:08:58,141 --> 00:09:00,474
and Kenting, Taiwan. 

245
00:09:00,474 --> 00:09:01,541
Since they're not famous places, 

246
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:04,241
they'll go viral once this is aired. 

247
00:09:04,608 --> 00:09:06,674
We have our 100 impartial judges 

248
00:09:06,674 --> 00:09:08,108
who will vote on today's trips. 

249
00:09:08,108 --> 00:09:09,441
Welcome. 

250
00:09:09,941 --> 00:09:12,941
(100 judges in the audience) 

251
00:09:12,941 --> 00:09:14,241
Which one should we watch first? 

252
00:09:14,241 --> 00:09:16,708
I'm curious about Xiamen. 

253
00:09:16,708 --> 00:09:18,208
- It's such a pretty name, Xiamen. / - Xiamen. 

254
00:09:18,208 --> 00:09:19,741
- It's a pretty name. / - Xiamen. 

255
00:09:19,741 --> 00:09:22,141
It was really nice. And it's next to the sea. 

256
00:09:22,141 --> 00:09:23,841
- It's an island. / - There must be seafood. 

257
00:09:23,841 --> 00:09:26,374
The seafood there is incredibly fresh, 

258
00:09:26,374 --> 00:09:29,008
cheap and delicious. 

259
00:09:29,008 --> 00:09:31,708
The place was full of such seafood. 

260
00:09:31,708 --> 00:09:35,508
You can't help but be captivated by this place. 

261
00:09:35,508 --> 00:09:39,041
It was amazing. 

262
00:09:40,008 --> 00:09:43,141
- What was that? / - She made that work. 

263
00:09:43,774 --> 00:09:46,641
- It sounded different. / - That's our saying. 

264
00:09:46,641 --> 00:09:47,874
Shall we watch theirs first? Is it okay? 

265
00:09:47,874 --> 00:09:49,274
- Yes, sure. / - Yes. 

266
00:09:49,274 --> 00:09:50,774
- Xiamen first. / - Yours is amazing, so it's okay, right? 

267
00:09:50,774 --> 00:09:52,441
- Of course. / - Because our trip is amazing. 

268
00:09:52,441 --> 00:09:54,608
It's a match between real sisters and fake sisters. 

269
00:09:54,608 --> 00:09:57,008
- Don't say that. / - Amazing fake sisters. 

270
00:09:57,008 --> 00:09:58,941
- Amazing sisters. / - Let's just say amazing sisters. 

271
00:09:58,941 --> 00:10:01,641
- Don't say fake sisters. / - Let's start with Xiamen. 

272
00:10:01,641 --> 00:10:03,041
- Let's go. / - Let's go. 

273
00:10:03,041 --> 00:10:04,074
(Unexpected Gift Tour in Xiamen starts) 

274
00:10:05,041 --> 00:10:08,241
(Heeeun's house, one evening in August) 

275
00:10:08,641 --> 00:10:10,008
You live next door, right? 

276
00:10:10,008 --> 00:10:11,674
Yes, she lives in the front. 

277
00:10:12,274 --> 00:10:13,608
Do you have something to eat? 

278
00:10:14,008 --> 00:10:15,674
- Of course, she has. / - Why do you always... 

279
00:10:15,674 --> 00:10:18,341
Look for food at my place? So annoying. 

280
00:10:19,274 --> 00:10:21,274
You prepared some fruits. 

281
00:10:21,274 --> 00:10:22,574
I found food. 

282
00:10:22,574 --> 00:10:24,774
You prepared it already. Why the complaints? 

283
00:10:25,108 --> 00:10:26,508
Why can't you just say, 

284
00:10:26,508 --> 00:10:28,708
"I prepared some fruits. Have some?" 

285
00:10:28,708 --> 00:10:30,174
I don't want to talk to you. 

286
00:10:30,174 --> 00:10:32,541
Okay, don't talk. Show me with your actions. 

287
00:10:32,541 --> 00:10:34,941
When should we go and come back? 

288
00:10:34,941 --> 00:10:36,474
I'm only free on weekends. 

289
00:10:36,474 --> 00:10:38,841
On weekdays, I host the live radio show. 

290
00:10:38,841 --> 00:10:39,774
I can't go anywhere. 

291
00:10:39,774 --> 00:10:42,441
I'm having my concert soon. 

292
00:10:43,108 --> 00:10:45,708
You're almost 70 but you're awesome. 

293
00:10:46,341 --> 00:10:49,941
How long will I last? I won't be able to keep at it. 

294
00:10:49,941 --> 00:10:53,241
Still, you're working at that age. 

295
00:10:53,241 --> 00:10:56,041
- I'm just doing my best to the end. / - You're blessed. 

296
00:10:56,508 --> 00:10:57,974
When does your play start? 

297
00:10:57,974 --> 00:11:00,774
September 1st. It ends on December 31st. 

298
00:11:00,774 --> 00:11:03,874
9, 10, 11, 12. You're stuck for 4 months. 

299
00:11:04,808 --> 00:11:05,641
I'm available only for two days. 

300
00:11:05,641 --> 00:11:09,074
Should we go on a weekend for 3 days and 2 nights? 

301
00:11:09,074 --> 00:11:13,841
Usually, people of her age watch dramas at home... 

302
00:11:13,841 --> 00:11:15,308
The highlight of the week is when their children call. 

303
00:11:15,308 --> 00:11:19,741
- But isn't it so nice that they're so busy? / - It is. 

304
00:11:21,074 --> 00:11:23,274
When I go on a trip with others, I plan the trip. 

305
00:11:23,274 --> 00:11:25,408
But when I'm with you, I don't. 

306
00:11:25,408 --> 00:11:26,774
(Heeeun will plan the trip) 

307
00:11:26,774 --> 00:11:29,541
I love planning trips with books. 

308
00:11:29,541 --> 00:11:32,241
Planning is where the trip starts. 

309
00:11:35,508 --> 00:11:38,208
She's very active on social media. 

310
00:11:38,208 --> 00:11:39,374
Where were you in the first picture? 

311
00:11:39,374 --> 00:11:41,174
Iceland. Thailand. 

312
00:11:43,374 --> 00:11:47,774
The most enjoyable thing in the world 

313
00:11:47,774 --> 00:11:50,908
is when I find a food that I love. 

314
00:11:50,908 --> 00:11:52,908
I think that's when I'm at my happiest. 

315
00:11:53,108 --> 00:11:55,674
- You don't like meat. / - No. 

316
00:11:55,674 --> 00:11:57,608
- You like seafood. / - Right. 

317
00:11:58,041 --> 00:11:59,874
- You don't like meat? / - No. 

318
00:11:59,874 --> 00:12:01,941
- She doesn't. / - You prefer seafood. 

319
00:12:02,374 --> 00:12:05,574
I want to go somewhere that's nice to walk around. 

320
00:12:06,241 --> 00:12:07,808
Somewhere flat. 

321
00:12:07,808 --> 00:12:09,774
- I can't climb up and down. / - No. 

322
00:12:09,774 --> 00:12:11,941
- Even with sneakers, it's hard. / - It is hard. 

323
00:12:12,774 --> 00:12:15,374
So I did some research... 

324
00:12:15,841 --> 00:12:17,808
And I found a place called Xiamen. 

325
00:12:17,808 --> 00:12:20,908
- Xiamen. / - I've never heard of that place. 

326
00:12:21,441 --> 00:12:22,674
Xiamen? 

327
00:12:22,674 --> 00:12:24,274
I don't know many people that know China well 

328
00:12:24,274 --> 00:12:27,441
but one of my friends once told me Xiamen was nice. 

329
00:12:27,741 --> 00:12:29,974
- I was told it's where... / - Do you remember that? 

330
00:12:29,974 --> 00:12:31,608
Chinese people like. 

331
00:12:31,608 --> 00:12:33,274
- I see. / - It's a vacation spot. 

332
00:12:33,574 --> 00:12:34,308
Most people... 

333
00:12:34,308 --> 00:12:36,274
- Most haven't heard of it. / - Won't have heard of it. 

334
00:12:36,274 --> 00:12:37,674
(Fujian tulou, Xiamen) 

335
00:12:37,674 --> 00:12:39,341
- What is that? / - It's a tulou. 

336
00:12:39,341 --> 00:12:42,774
It's called tulou. It's a type of ancient dwelling. 

337
00:12:42,774 --> 00:12:44,441
- It's a dwelling. / - It's pretty. 

338
00:12:44,974 --> 00:12:46,974
This is an island called Gulangyu. 

339
00:12:47,474 --> 00:12:50,008
It's 15 minutes from Xiamen by boat. 

340
00:12:50,641 --> 00:12:51,808
It's so pretty. 

341
00:12:51,808 --> 00:12:54,608
- It's like Europe. / - I told you. 

342
00:12:54,608 --> 00:12:56,841
It's like Europe with Chinese lighting. 

343
00:12:56,841 --> 00:12:58,074
Exactly. 

344
00:12:58,474 --> 00:13:00,608
That's the lighting Chinese love. 

345
00:13:00,608 --> 00:13:03,408
- It's always gold and red in China. / - That's true. 

346
00:13:03,408 --> 00:13:03,908
(Xiamen) 

347
00:13:04,841 --> 00:13:05,908
How long does it take? 

348
00:13:06,774 --> 00:13:07,808
3 to 3.5 hours. 

349
00:13:07,808 --> 00:13:09,974
- 3 hours is pretty long. / - It's pretty long. 

350
00:13:10,474 --> 00:13:12,708
It's right next to Taiwan, so it's pretty far. 

351
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:16,574
The flight hours are very important. I hate flying. 

352
00:13:16,574 --> 00:13:19,008
If you fly for too long, you get tired. 

353
00:13:19,641 --> 00:13:22,374
In the late 1800s, 

354
00:13:22,374 --> 00:13:24,474
powerful foreign countries came in 

355
00:13:24,474 --> 00:13:27,008
and opened trade. 

356
00:13:27,008 --> 00:13:30,908
This area was designated for foreign residents. 

357
00:13:30,908 --> 00:13:34,041
That's why there are European-style buildings here. 

358
00:13:34,674 --> 00:13:38,108
It says it doesn't look like typical China. 

359
00:13:38,441 --> 00:13:39,608
I didn't read much in detail though. 

360
00:13:39,608 --> 00:13:41,708
My eyes were getting tired. 

361
00:13:42,441 --> 00:13:44,608
If you travel with Heeeun, 

362
00:13:44,608 --> 00:13:47,274
she teaches you a lot about the history. 

363
00:13:47,274 --> 00:13:50,008
- I majored in history. / - Exactly, I love it. 

364
00:13:51,974 --> 00:13:55,341
- I should do some research at home. / - Do it. 

365
00:13:56,041 --> 00:13:57,441
Where do we sleep? 

366
00:13:58,041 --> 00:13:59,608
You have to sleep alone, right? 

367
00:13:59,608 --> 00:14:01,141
You don't sleep alone? 

368
00:14:01,141 --> 00:14:03,141
I can sleep with others. 

369
00:14:03,141 --> 00:14:04,608
- You can? / - Absolutely. 

370
00:14:04,608 --> 00:14:06,574
But others can't sleep with you. 

371
00:14:06,574 --> 00:14:09,841
(Laughing) 

372
00:14:09,841 --> 00:14:12,474
- I can sleep well. / - You would just sleep. 

373
00:14:12,474 --> 00:14:14,808
- Others can't sleep next to me. / - Exactly. 

374
00:14:15,041 --> 00:14:17,308
I don't eat breakfast. 

375
00:14:17,308 --> 00:14:20,241
Then we should book a room without breakfast. 

376
00:14:20,241 --> 00:14:23,074
- I don't need breakfast. / - I always eat breakfast. 

377
00:14:23,074 --> 00:14:25,041
If you don't eat breakfast, you'll faint. You need it. 

378
00:14:25,041 --> 00:14:27,141
- I need breakfast. / - As soon as you open your eyes. 

379
00:14:27,141 --> 00:14:29,341
I have to take a shower and eat. 

380
00:14:30,241 --> 00:14:32,474
Around 6:30 to 7 a.m. in Korean time. 

381
00:14:32,474 --> 00:14:34,308
I have my first meal at 12 p.m. 

382
00:14:34,308 --> 00:14:36,074
- Let's book our rooms separately. / - Separately? 

383
00:14:36,074 --> 00:14:38,308
- We're such funny sisters. / - We are. 

384
00:14:38,908 --> 00:14:40,208
So you have to sleep separately. 

385
00:14:40,208 --> 00:14:43,908
- Heekyeong is a bit more sensitive. / - Yes. 

386
00:14:43,908 --> 00:14:45,574
And Heeeun is a heavy sleeper. 

387
00:14:45,574 --> 00:14:47,541
- She sleeps well and eats well. / - I see. 

388
00:14:48,208 --> 00:14:49,241
Even twins... 

389
00:14:49,674 --> 00:14:51,508
- Seojun doesn't eat breakfast. / - They're different. 

390
00:14:52,608 --> 00:14:53,841
While Seoeon has a big breakfast. 

391
00:14:53,841 --> 00:14:55,841
- It's very interesting. / - Twins can be so different? 

392
00:14:55,841 --> 00:14:58,574
From the same stomach but totally different. 

393
00:14:59,608 --> 00:15:01,641
Do we have our team name? 

394
00:15:02,208 --> 00:15:03,941
- Unexpected Gift. / - What? 

395
00:15:03,941 --> 00:15:05,208
Unexpected Gift. 

396
00:15:05,208 --> 00:15:10,341
Because this trip is like an unexpected gift. 

397
00:15:10,341 --> 00:15:15,141
This short break after work feels like a gift to me. 

398
00:15:15,774 --> 00:15:18,641
- Unexpected Gift. / - Unexpected Gift Team. 

399
00:15:18,641 --> 00:15:19,974
Team. 

400
00:15:19,974 --> 00:15:21,774
We're never in synch. 

401
00:15:22,541 --> 00:15:24,574
Nothing works out. 

402
00:15:27,174 --> 00:15:28,608
This is when we were young. 

403
00:15:28,608 --> 00:15:29,808
How adorable. 

404
00:15:29,808 --> 00:15:32,908
(They've been standing by each other for 60 years) 

405
00:15:34,108 --> 00:15:40,541
(The sisters are going to receive an unexpected gift) 

406
00:15:40,974 --> 00:15:42,808
You should film using this. 

407
00:15:43,141 --> 00:15:44,341
- Why should I use this? / - Come on. 

408
00:15:44,341 --> 00:15:46,241
(In reality, bickering is part of their daily lives) 

409
00:15:46,241 --> 00:15:47,908
She's not even using it. 

410
00:15:49,274 --> 00:15:52,674
- Toilet is important. / - And so is a department store. 

411
00:15:52,674 --> 00:15:55,441
We held hands all day long. 

412
00:15:56,141 --> 00:15:57,241
From here on... 

413
00:15:57,241 --> 00:16:00,341
- We're the raincoat sisters. / - Sisters. 

414
00:16:01,174 --> 00:16:04,741
My goodness, how pretty. 

415
00:16:04,741 --> 00:16:06,774
- Let's walk. / - No. 

416
00:16:06,774 --> 00:16:08,041
I can't do this. 

417
00:16:09,874 --> 00:16:11,441
I like bugs. 

418
00:16:11,441 --> 00:16:13,474
Move your hand. Your fingers look like silkworms. 

419
00:16:13,474 --> 00:16:15,908
Just what are you thinking about? 

420
00:16:16,841 --> 00:16:18,208
I'm scared. 

421
00:16:19,041 --> 00:16:20,474
Use your body. 

422
00:16:20,474 --> 00:16:22,241
You ruined it. 

423
00:16:22,574 --> 00:16:24,408
- You think I can last? / - Yes, I do. 

424
00:16:24,941 --> 00:16:26,808
(Yang Heekyeong, 65-year-old younger sister) 

425
00:16:27,941 --> 00:16:30,608
(They look around the city and enjoy it to the fullest) 

426
00:16:30,608 --> 00:16:32,941
This is very delicious. 

427
00:16:33,508 --> 00:16:36,208
(From Xiamen-style breakfast which they love) 

428
00:16:36,208 --> 00:16:38,308
- That looks delicious. / - That was delicious. 

429
00:16:38,308 --> 00:16:40,141
- Are those eggs? / - Yes. 

430
00:16:40,441 --> 00:16:42,641
- I strongly recommend this. / - My goodness! 

431
00:16:42,641 --> 00:16:43,908
This is right up my alley. 

432
00:16:45,774 --> 00:16:47,808
It's been a long time... 

433
00:16:47,808 --> 00:16:49,341
- The scenery is pretty. / - How pretty. 

434
00:16:49,341 --> 00:16:51,374
This has been such a precious day. 

435
00:16:51,374 --> 00:16:55,208
- So pretty. / - What an expected gift today has been. 

436
00:16:57,908 --> 00:17:00,108
(The day before the trip at Heeeun's house) 

437
00:17:00,108 --> 00:17:05,374
Xiamen is one of the cities that the Chinese locals 

438
00:17:05,374 --> 00:17:08,408
want to live in when they get older. 

439
00:17:09,274 --> 00:17:10,841
Everyone, her dogs are 

440
00:17:10,841 --> 00:17:14,874
the only animals on Earth that can attack Heeeun. 

441
00:17:14,874 --> 00:17:18,441
I've been away a lot recently. 

442
00:17:18,441 --> 00:17:20,874
They're making a scene so I won't go. 

443
00:17:20,874 --> 00:17:23,574
I'm trying not to 

444
00:17:23,574 --> 00:17:26,974
pack a lot of things. 

445
00:17:26,974 --> 00:17:31,208
Even until now, I'm not satisfied with the way I pack. 

446
00:17:31,674 --> 00:17:32,674
Hey, there. 

447
00:17:33,741 --> 00:17:35,908
(First essential of the oldest trip planner, a unique hat) 

448
00:17:35,908 --> 00:17:39,308
Like this? The first-aid kit. 

449
00:17:39,308 --> 00:17:40,941
- You always carry that around. / - Yes. 

450
00:17:40,941 --> 00:17:44,174
These are linen pants. These are my pajama pants. 

451
00:17:44,174 --> 00:17:46,008
I'm sure one pair would suffice. 

452
00:17:46,008 --> 00:17:48,041
Heekyeong learned how to sew... 

453
00:17:48,041 --> 00:17:51,274
- And made these two shirts for me. / - My gosh. 

454
00:17:51,608 --> 00:17:54,208
- Really? / - I'm sure a trip by a 67-year-old... 

455
00:17:54,208 --> 00:17:56,674
And a 65-year-old will be different from 

456
00:17:56,674 --> 00:17:58,241
the young people's. 

457
00:17:58,241 --> 00:18:00,041
I researched on social media 

458
00:18:00,041 --> 00:18:02,708
and read the posts that young people uploaded. 

459
00:18:03,141 --> 00:18:06,674
And I've been to a few of those places. 

460
00:18:07,308 --> 00:18:09,908
It could be that my palate along with everything else 

461
00:18:09,908 --> 00:18:11,441
weren't in agreement with the youngsters these days. 

462
00:18:12,141 --> 00:18:16,374
Unless I go around and find new places myself, 

463
00:18:16,374 --> 00:18:18,741
it won't be easy to find good places. 

464
00:18:20,641 --> 00:18:22,008
I'm looking forward to this a lot. 

465
00:18:22,641 --> 00:18:24,041
- See the suitcases behind her? / - Yes. 

466
00:18:24,041 --> 00:18:25,941
Imagine how often she travels 

467
00:18:25,941 --> 00:18:28,208
that they're always on standby. 

468
00:18:28,208 --> 00:18:30,008
- Just like pot plants. / - Yes. 

469
00:18:31,008 --> 00:18:37,141
I'm not good at researching things online. 

470
00:18:37,141 --> 00:18:40,074
That's why I asked my son for help 

471
00:18:40,074 --> 00:18:42,274
to find places to go. 

472
00:18:42,274 --> 00:18:44,074
I'll see you soon. 

473
00:18:44,474 --> 00:18:45,708
Hello. 

474
00:18:45,708 --> 00:18:47,608
(Her 40-year-old son can use the internet) 

475
00:18:48,341 --> 00:18:50,908
The street in Zeng Cuo An Village. 

476
00:18:50,908 --> 00:18:54,874
- They sell ice cream there. / - And food street there. 

477
00:18:54,874 --> 00:18:57,341
This is the street food they sell there. 

478
00:18:58,108 --> 00:18:59,641
They look delicious. What is that one? 

479
00:18:59,641 --> 00:19:01,241
It's Dongpo pork. 

480
00:19:03,374 --> 00:19:05,574
- The fried eggplants look great. / - Seafood stew. 

481
00:19:05,574 --> 00:19:07,674
- Seafood stew? / - She reminds me of my mom. 

482
00:19:08,508 --> 00:19:09,774
This is the shrimp pie. 

483
00:19:10,574 --> 00:19:12,541
Oyster fritters. Mango shaved ice. 

484
00:19:12,874 --> 00:19:14,874
Zhongshan Road is the paradise for shoppers. 

485
00:19:14,874 --> 00:19:15,974
Is that so? 

486
00:19:16,574 --> 00:19:19,408
- You can shop and eat. / - What could I buy there? 

487
00:19:19,408 --> 00:19:21,574
- What? / - If not food? 

488
00:19:23,008 --> 00:19:24,508
Buy me a gift. 

489
00:19:25,008 --> 00:19:27,574
(Laughing) 

490
00:19:27,574 --> 00:19:29,708
- Do you like shopping? / - Yes, I do. 

491
00:19:30,141 --> 00:19:31,174
- We like browsing. / - I see. 

492
00:19:31,541 --> 00:19:34,674
It's really fun to go shopping with Heeeun. 

493
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:37,641
She tells us what we wouldn't have known. 

494
00:19:38,308 --> 00:19:41,541
- "You can only find this cotton here." / - That's right. 

495
00:19:41,541 --> 00:19:43,474
I bought a handkerchief with her, and I still use it. 

496
00:19:43,474 --> 00:19:44,774
- It's really good. / - Right? 

497
00:19:44,774 --> 00:19:46,741
She tells people what they should buy. 

498
00:19:46,741 --> 00:19:48,174
- And you like buying things. / - Right. 

499
00:19:48,174 --> 00:19:50,741
- That's the best combination. / - We're perfect. 

500
00:19:50,741 --> 00:19:52,641
- Good job. / - Don't fight with aunt. 

501
00:19:52,641 --> 00:19:53,841
I won't. 

502
00:19:54,274 --> 00:19:55,308
1, 2. 

503
00:19:56,708 --> 00:19:59,108
(They finally depart for Xiamen, the mysterious city) 

504
00:19:59,441 --> 00:20:00,908
(Xiamen) 

505
00:20:00,908 --> 00:20:03,374
- A 3-hour flight is great. / - That's perfect. 

506
00:20:03,841 --> 00:20:05,941
- I'm curious. / - It's warm there in winter, right? 

507
00:20:05,941 --> 00:20:07,608
- Yes, it is. / - Right. 

508
00:20:07,608 --> 00:20:10,008
- It's really nice from November. / - It's the best. 

509
00:20:10,008 --> 00:20:11,374
It'd be perfect to go there after this airs. 

510
00:20:11,374 --> 00:20:13,208
- People can visit then. / - That's right. 

511
00:20:13,208 --> 00:20:15,541
We're in Xiamen. 

512
00:20:16,174 --> 00:20:18,174
We have arrived in Xiamen. 

513
00:20:18,808 --> 00:20:20,374
(This is Heekyeong's very first selfie stick) 

514
00:20:20,374 --> 00:20:22,108
I've never held a selfie stick before. 

515
00:20:23,774 --> 00:20:26,241
- We have arrived... / - Wait, this person is blocking you. 

516
00:20:26,241 --> 00:20:28,408
In Xiamen. Come on, you do it too. 

517
00:20:28,408 --> 00:20:30,208
- Why? We can look at that one. / - Right now... 

518
00:20:30,208 --> 00:20:33,008
No, film it with this camera. 

519
00:20:33,008 --> 00:20:34,941
(These sisters in their 60s are still very energetic) 

520
00:20:34,941 --> 00:20:38,841
- They're so realistic. / - They will air this. 

521
00:20:38,841 --> 00:20:39,874
Alright. 

522
00:20:39,874 --> 00:20:44,074
We are at the airport in Xiamen. 

523
00:20:44,074 --> 00:20:46,974
It took us 3 hours to get here. 

524
00:20:46,974 --> 00:20:51,108
Right now, it's 2:10 a.m. in Korea. 

525
00:20:51,108 --> 00:20:54,541
The public transportations don't run at this hour. 

526
00:20:54,541 --> 00:20:55,308
Okay. 

527
00:20:55,841 --> 00:20:58,208
That's why we have to take a taxi. 

528
00:20:58,208 --> 00:21:00,974
- Okay. / - Let's take that. 

529
00:21:02,341 --> 00:21:04,208
They aren't very friendly. 

530
00:21:04,208 --> 00:21:07,241
We can't ride with this in the seat. 

531
00:21:07,241 --> 00:21:08,408
Thank you. 

532
00:21:08,408 --> 00:21:11,074
(Taxi from the airport to hotel, $3.20) 

533
00:21:11,074 --> 00:21:12,541
How's the taxi fare there? 

534
00:21:12,541 --> 00:21:15,608
- It's not that expensive. / - I see. 

535
00:21:16,008 --> 00:21:20,574
(15 minutes by taxi from the airport to the hotel) 

536
00:21:20,574 --> 00:21:22,741
- Yours is on that side. / - Mine is 1001. 

537
00:21:22,741 --> 00:21:25,008
- Go to the right then. / - Okay. 

538
00:21:25,008 --> 00:21:27,408
- Good night. / - Good night. 

539
00:21:27,841 --> 00:21:30,441
- See you in the morning. / - See you tomorrow morning. 

540
00:21:30,441 --> 00:21:32,241
(They bid an unexpected farewell) 

541
00:21:32,241 --> 00:21:34,641
They're splitting. That's unusual. 

542
00:21:34,641 --> 00:21:37,474
- And we are sisters. / - They're nice suites. 

543
00:21:38,774 --> 00:21:41,108
I'll wash up and change into my pajamas. 

544
00:21:41,574 --> 00:21:42,741
You can leave now. 

545
00:21:42,741 --> 00:21:45,108
Then good-bye. 

546
00:21:46,074 --> 00:21:47,474
I'll see you tomorrow morning. 

547
00:21:48,241 --> 00:21:51,208
If I'm not out by 9 a.m., just leave without me. 

548
00:21:51,208 --> 00:21:53,741
(Will their trip in Xiamen be okay?) 

549
00:21:54,108 --> 00:21:55,841
- It's fine to leave first. / - Okay. 

550
00:21:55,841 --> 00:21:57,174
- Everything is close by. / - That's right. 

551
00:21:57,174 --> 00:21:59,941
- You can catch up soon. / - You can. 

552
00:22:08,708 --> 00:22:09,874
("Autumn Morning" by Yang Heeeun) 

553
00:22:09,874 --> 00:22:12,441
That's Bailuzhou Park. 

554
00:22:18,141 --> 00:22:20,774
(What's the start of Unexpected Gift Tour?) 

555
00:22:20,774 --> 00:22:22,874
(Main street with European-style buildings in Xiamen) 

556
00:22:24,674 --> 00:22:26,508
(Zhongshan Road) 

557

(Unexpected Gift Tour in Xiamen) 

558
00:22:27,541 --> 00:22:31,508
(Zhongshan Road and local breakfast) 

559
00:22:31,508 --> 00:22:33,508
There is this street called Zhongshan Road. 

560
00:22:33,508 --> 00:22:35,308
It's a street only for pedestrians. 

561
00:22:35,308 --> 00:22:38,808
We can look at European-style architecture there. 

562
00:22:38,808 --> 00:22:41,741
The street is very exotic. 

563
00:22:41,741 --> 00:22:44,874
And locals in Xiamen go all the way there 

564
00:22:44,874 --> 00:22:46,774
to have seafood. 

565
00:22:46,774 --> 00:22:50,241
If the timing works out, we can have seafood there. 

566
00:22:51,408 --> 00:22:55,208
- This is Zhongshan Road. / - Zhongshan Road. 

567
00:22:55,474 --> 00:22:56,941
- Zhongshan Road. / - Zhongshan Road. 

568
00:22:56,941 --> 00:23:00,341
Hey, you're not supposed to speak Chinese like that. 

569
00:23:00,341 --> 00:23:04,274
- Zhongshan Road. / - Stop trying to copy the accent. 

570
00:23:04,274 --> 00:23:07,741
According to what I read in a book about here, 

571
00:23:07,741 --> 00:23:13,108
there are traces of European-style architecture here. 

572
00:23:13,108 --> 00:23:15,741
People come here to shop too. 

573
00:23:17,308 --> 00:23:19,041
The upper floors are apartments. 

574
00:23:19,041 --> 00:23:20,141
Stores are on the first floors. 

575
00:23:20,141 --> 00:23:21,608
- It's a residential complex. / - Yes. 

576
00:23:21,608 --> 00:23:22,474
(It's a mix of Chinese and Western architecture) 

577
00:23:22,474 --> 00:23:25,141
- This looks like Hong Kong. / - It does, doesn't it? 

578
00:23:25,141 --> 00:23:28,441
Whenever you're on a trip, it always rains. 

579
00:23:28,441 --> 00:23:29,674
Since I was born in the Year of the Dragon, 

580
00:23:29,674 --> 00:23:30,708
I like the rain. 

581
00:23:31,508 --> 00:23:33,441
- I don't care about the rain. / - I'm famous for that. 

582
00:23:33,441 --> 00:23:35,274
Ever since you were in elementary school... 

583
00:23:35,274 --> 00:23:37,341
- It rained on your field trip days. / - That's true. 

584
00:23:37,341 --> 00:23:39,708
That's why people used to say that 

585
00:23:39,708 --> 00:23:44,041
it's raining because dragons are going on a field trip. 

586
00:23:44,041 --> 00:23:45,441
- "No cars here." / - There are no cars here. 

587
00:23:45,441 --> 00:23:47,641
- This is so nice. / - It's really nice here. 

588
00:23:47,641 --> 00:23:49,241
I was wondering why you were walking on the road. 

589
00:23:49,241 --> 00:23:51,308
- But cars can't go there. / - There are no cars there. 

590
00:23:51,308 --> 00:23:54,541
Cars can't go on certain roads once a week or so. 

591
00:23:54,541 --> 00:23:56,508
But it's all year long over there. 

592
00:23:58,574 --> 00:24:01,808
(When the sun sets on this elegant Zhongshan Road) 

593
00:24:02,141 --> 00:24:06,074
Not only can you find food on this street... 

594
00:24:06,074 --> 00:24:09,474
- But you can also shop there. / - We went again at night. 

595
00:24:09,474 --> 00:24:11,308
I heard that it's pretty there at night. 

596
00:24:11,308 --> 00:24:13,274
- That's true. / - Because of the night view. 

597
00:24:13,274 --> 00:24:14,708
A lot of people came to look at that. 

598
00:24:14,708 --> 00:24:16,274
- It was crowded. / - It's like Myeong-dong in Korea. 

599
00:24:16,274 --> 00:24:17,741
- That's right. / - Yes, it is. 

600
00:24:17,741 --> 00:24:19,074
(The splendid night view will be revealed later) 

601
00:24:19,741 --> 00:24:21,974
- Are those residential apartments? / - This... 

602
00:24:22,241 --> 00:24:24,341
Do you see laundry? I see it. 

603
00:24:24,341 --> 00:24:26,041
People must live there then. 

604
00:24:26,041 --> 00:24:29,441
It's like a residential complex. 

605
00:24:29,441 --> 00:24:32,474
- People live in those buildings. / - You're right. 

606
00:24:34,808 --> 00:24:37,674
These apartments are really modest. 

607
00:24:37,674 --> 00:24:39,841
But property here must be expensive. 

608
00:24:39,841 --> 00:24:41,341
Goodness, that's crazy. 

609
00:24:41,341 --> 00:24:42,808
Look at the wedding photo shoot. 

610
00:24:42,808 --> 00:24:44,208
Would you look at that? 

611
00:24:45,674 --> 00:24:47,674
- My gosh. / - It's a wedding photo shoot. 

612
00:24:47,708 --> 00:24:48,708
But it's raining. 

613
00:24:48,974 --> 00:24:51,508
She's sweeping Zhongshan Road. 

614
00:24:52,608 --> 00:24:54,974
- My goodness. / - She's using the dress to clean. 

615
00:24:54,974 --> 00:24:56,174
"Cleaning Zhongshan Road." 

616
00:24:56,841 --> 00:24:58,174
They're done cleaning. 

617
00:24:59,108 --> 00:25:00,441
They should wash the dress. 

618
00:25:00,641 --> 00:25:03,308
(They start to explore Zhongshan Road) 

619
00:25:03,308 --> 00:25:04,741
What is that? 

620
00:25:05,541 --> 00:25:07,108
What is that? 

621
00:25:07,108 --> 00:25:09,208
- Mango? / - I don't know. 

622
00:25:09,208 --> 00:25:11,608
It's mango. 

623
00:25:12,341 --> 00:25:13,441
- These? / - Yes. 

624
00:25:13,441 --> 00:25:15,208
Excuse me. Papaya? 

625
00:25:15,208 --> 00:25:16,208
- Mango? / - Mango? 

626
00:25:16,541 --> 00:25:17,574
- It's mango. / - Mango. 

627
00:25:17,574 --> 00:25:18,808
- Those are... / - They're huge. 

628
00:25:18,808 --> 00:25:21,741
It's as big as two hands put together. 

629
00:25:21,741 --> 00:25:24,108
- Dried fish. Beef jerky. / - This is the beef jerky. 

630
00:25:24,108 --> 00:25:25,241
- Hey. / - My gosh. 

631
00:25:26,008 --> 00:25:27,874
This is seafood. 

632
00:25:27,874 --> 00:25:31,441
- It's dried seafood. / - Yes, dried seafood. 

633
00:25:33,041 --> 00:25:34,708
And these are dried fruits. 

634
00:25:34,974 --> 00:25:36,908
- Do you remember that? The squid. / - The squid. 

635
00:25:36,908 --> 00:25:39,108
You press it flat like this. 

636
00:25:40,674 --> 00:25:42,208
I thought it was a straw mat. 

637
00:25:42,208 --> 00:25:43,474
They're like straw mats. 

638
00:25:43,708 --> 00:25:45,508
I find that place the most interesting. 

639
00:25:47,441 --> 00:25:48,674
- Heeeun. / - Goodness. 

640
00:25:50,908 --> 00:25:52,674
Fresh-water pearls. 

641
00:25:52,674 --> 00:25:54,241
Are these pearl oysters? 

642
00:25:56,441 --> 00:25:57,574
(Stirred up) 

643
00:25:57,574 --> 00:26:00,208
- Are they all pearls inside? / - Yes. 

644
00:26:00,474 --> 00:26:01,974
Pearls are stuck inside. 

645
00:26:01,974 --> 00:26:03,274
Are these pearl oysters? 

646
00:26:04,041 --> 00:26:05,874
There are dozens inside. 

647
00:26:05,874 --> 00:26:06,774
It looks gross. 

648
00:26:07,708 --> 00:26:12,608
They say pearls are good for women. 

649
00:26:12,608 --> 00:26:13,941
Especially pearl necklaces. 

650
00:26:14,141 --> 00:26:18,174
When pearls touch this acupuncture point... 

651
00:26:18,174 --> 00:26:21,308
Because pearls supplement the yin energy, 

652
00:26:21,308 --> 00:26:23,174
they're good for women. 

653
00:26:23,974 --> 00:26:26,941
(Pearl harvesting, $8.20) 

654
00:26:26,941 --> 00:26:28,741
Can you make accessories with those pearls? 

655
00:26:28,741 --> 00:26:30,408
Yes, you can make them there. 

656
00:26:30,408 --> 00:26:32,708
- Can you make a ring? / - Ring, bracelet, everything. 

657
00:26:33,374 --> 00:26:35,441
- And that's only a few dollars? / - $8. 

658
00:26:35,441 --> 00:26:38,441
You can buy the pearls for $8. 

659
00:26:38,441 --> 00:26:39,908
- And harvest them. / - $8. 

660
00:26:39,908 --> 00:26:41,508
You have to pay extra to make something. 

661
00:26:41,508 --> 00:26:43,074
- I only bought the pearls. / - Are they pretty? 

662
00:26:43,074 --> 00:26:44,374
- Yes. / - They're nice. 

663
00:26:44,374 --> 00:26:46,274
Because they have irregular shapes. 

664
00:26:47,174 --> 00:26:49,174
- They look natural. / - That's right. 

665
00:26:49,674 --> 00:26:51,274
Let's harvest one. 

666
00:26:51,808 --> 00:26:52,808
You don't know how many you'll get. 

667
00:26:52,808 --> 00:26:55,174
I'll choose it. Wait. 

668
00:26:55,174 --> 00:26:56,474
I can pick one from here. 

669
00:27:02,574 --> 00:27:03,641
- Here. / - Okay. 

670
00:27:03,874 --> 00:27:05,808
Can't I eat the clam? 

671
00:27:06,908 --> 00:27:08,508
I'm interested in eating. 

672
00:27:08,941 --> 00:27:11,674
Let's open it. Yes, you can eat it. 

673
00:27:11,674 --> 00:27:12,674
- Pearl oyster. / - Goodness. 

674
00:27:13,074 --> 00:27:14,874
- Gosh. / - Like this. 

675
00:27:15,174 --> 00:27:17,274
- Look at that. / - Goodness. 

676
00:27:17,274 --> 00:27:18,274
They give you those? 

677
00:27:18,274 --> 00:27:20,374
Yes, you take them home. 

678
00:27:20,374 --> 00:27:22,474
- All of that for $8? / - Yes. 

679
00:27:23,674 --> 00:27:25,808
The pearls are embedded in the flesh. 

680
00:27:25,808 --> 00:27:27,941
That's why they're called wounds. 

681
00:27:27,941 --> 00:27:30,241
They must hurt a lot. 

682
00:27:30,241 --> 00:27:32,041
They must hurt. I think so. 

683
00:27:32,674 --> 00:27:33,741
Let's do this one. 

684
00:27:33,741 --> 00:27:35,641
(It's Heekyeong's turn) 

685
00:27:35,641 --> 00:27:37,008
Why pick the one she chose? 

686
00:27:37,008 --> 00:27:38,941
I was going to choose that anyway. 

687
00:27:38,941 --> 00:27:39,974
(Heekyeong is the passive sister) 

688
00:27:41,174 --> 00:27:43,541
(How many pearls will Heekyeong get?) 

689
00:27:43,541 --> 00:27:45,441
- You need to pick a good one. / - You do. 

690
00:27:45,441 --> 00:27:47,141
Because some oysters don't have many. 

691
00:27:47,708 --> 00:27:50,374
- I want to try that. / - Wow, that's a lot. 

692
00:27:50,374 --> 00:27:51,908
Heekyeong got more. 

693
00:27:51,908 --> 00:27:53,341
They're much bigger too. 

694
00:27:53,608 --> 00:27:54,874
Mine are small. 

695
00:27:57,808 --> 00:27:59,141
You got more. 

696
00:27:59,141 --> 00:28:00,408
(Heekyeong's pearls, Heeeun's pearls) 

697
00:28:00,974 --> 00:28:02,908
- This one is cute. / - Goodness. 

698
00:28:04,374 --> 00:28:06,008
It's a baby. 

699
00:28:06,708 --> 00:28:08,608
It's your lucky day. 

700
00:28:09,374 --> 00:28:10,441
Lucky. 

701
00:28:11,441 --> 00:28:13,308
She must think you're scolding her. 

702
00:28:13,308 --> 00:28:14,441
She doesn't know what you're saying. 

703
00:28:14,441 --> 00:28:15,574
She got taken aback. 

704
00:28:16,241 --> 00:28:17,474
Wait a minute. 

705
00:28:18,441 --> 00:28:20,808
I'll use the translator. 

706
00:28:22,674 --> 00:28:24,374
Your business will prosper. 

707
00:28:25,341 --> 00:28:28,041
(Will the translator work?) 

708
00:28:28,041 --> 00:28:29,241
- Thank you. / - Thank you. 

709
00:28:29,241 --> 00:28:31,108
(Even the translator makes the sisters happy) 

710
00:28:31,108 --> 00:28:35,408
There's a place here where we can have breakfast. 

711
00:28:35,408 --> 00:28:37,974
Let's go and find out how it tastes. 

712
00:28:37,974 --> 00:28:39,774
I'm curious. 

713
00:28:40,274 --> 00:28:42,741
I want to eat that when I go to China. 

714
00:28:42,741 --> 00:28:46,474
There are sweet beans in China. 

715
00:28:46,474 --> 00:28:48,474
It's a type of bean. 

716
00:28:48,908 --> 00:28:51,608
I want to eat things like that, 

717
00:28:51,608 --> 00:28:54,308
so when I was in Taiwan, 

718
00:28:54,308 --> 00:28:57,274
I ate at a restaurant at an intersection 

719
00:28:57,274 --> 00:28:59,808
where local people went to eat breakfast. 

720
00:29:00,308 --> 00:29:01,941
It was pretty good. 

721
00:29:01,941 --> 00:29:03,374
When we go to China... 

722
00:29:03,374 --> 00:29:06,441
- We can find local restaurants. / - Let's find them. 

723
00:29:06,441 --> 00:29:07,741
- That'll be nice. / - It'd be good. 

724
00:29:10,141 --> 00:29:11,608
- Look. / - We're here. 

725
00:29:11,608 --> 00:29:13,841
It's a place approved by the Chinese government. 

726
00:29:14,041 --> 00:29:14,941
- I see. / - Peanut. 

727
00:29:14,941 --> 00:29:18,008
- Soup, soup. / - Peanut soup shop. 

728
00:29:18,008 --> 00:29:20,274
Goodness, this is what I wanted. 

729
00:29:20,441 --> 00:29:22,674
- What is? / - This kind of breakfast. 

730
00:29:24,108 --> 00:29:24,908
Restaurants like that are... 

731
00:29:24,908 --> 00:29:27,841
- Delicious everywhere. / - I like that kind of restaurant. 

732
00:29:27,841 --> 00:29:29,641
(Food from various regions can be tasted) 

733
00:29:29,641 --> 00:29:30,741
Goodness. 

734
00:29:34,674 --> 00:29:38,741
(You can get a lot of food for a cheap price) 

735
00:29:40,674 --> 00:29:45,241
(Locals come to this restaurant more than tourists) 

736
00:29:46,508 --> 00:29:48,508
(A special payment method) 

737
00:29:49,041 --> 00:29:52,508
(First you pay cash to charge up a card) 

738
00:29:52,508 --> 00:29:54,674
(Money on the card gets deducted as you buy food) 

739
00:29:54,674 --> 00:29:56,808
(Money leftover is refunded when you leave) 

740
00:29:58,274 --> 00:29:59,308
This is oyster fritter. 

741
00:29:59,308 --> 00:30:02,341
(There are plenty of fresh seafood) 

742
00:30:03,108 --> 00:30:04,841
- I'll try that. / - Okay, just a little. 

743
00:30:04,841 --> 00:30:06,608
(She orders one oyster fritter) 

744
00:30:07,608 --> 00:30:09,474
(20 yuan has been paid) 

745
00:30:09,474 --> 00:30:11,174
(That's interesting) 

746
00:30:11,941 --> 00:30:13,241
- I want that. / - That one. 

747
00:30:13,241 --> 00:30:15,608
(Heekyeong gets vegetable rolls) 

748
00:30:19,641 --> 00:30:20,941
(That looks like fun) 

749
00:30:21,341 --> 00:30:23,141
(I'll try it too!) 

750
00:30:23,141 --> 00:30:25,641
Peanut soup. 

751
00:30:25,641 --> 00:30:26,908
- Did it work? / - One soup. 

752
00:30:31,574 --> 00:30:33,241
(Serious) 

753
00:30:33,241 --> 00:30:34,841
(It worked) 

754
00:30:36,241 --> 00:30:38,341
(Heekyeong buys a peanut soup) 

755
00:30:39,441 --> 00:30:40,908
(Laughing) 

756
00:30:40,908 --> 00:30:42,008
This is fun. 

757
00:30:43,908 --> 00:30:45,774
That's the laughter of a master. 

758
00:30:46,508 --> 00:30:48,941
My sister and I did it... 

759
00:30:48,941 --> 00:30:51,441
- So you can do it too. / - You can do it. 

760
00:30:51,941 --> 00:30:55,174
This is your second breakfast. 

761
00:30:56,441 --> 00:30:58,308
(Heeeun had breakfast as soon as it opened) 

762
00:30:58,308 --> 00:31:00,741
- She had breakfast like that. / - I ate alone... 

763
00:31:00,741 --> 00:31:02,708
At an empty breakfast buffet. 

764
00:31:02,708 --> 00:31:03,908
That's like a warm up. 

765
00:31:05,041 --> 00:31:07,841
(This is Heeeun's second breakfast) 

766
00:31:07,841 --> 00:31:08,874
I think... 

767
00:31:09,941 --> 00:31:11,741
When women are traveling... 

768
00:31:12,374 --> 00:31:16,641
Rather than going to expensive and fancy restaurants, 

769
00:31:16,641 --> 00:31:19,574
I go to a place where a lot of locals go to eat. 

770
00:31:20,841 --> 00:31:23,441
I highly recommend that you eat like the locals. 

771
00:31:23,941 --> 00:31:25,841
Wherever you go, go to where the locals go. 

772
00:31:25,841 --> 00:31:27,308
- Then you won't fail. / - That's right. 

773
00:31:27,708 --> 00:31:29,141
I'll try the oyster. 

774
00:31:29,608 --> 00:31:31,741
That looks like bulgogi but it's oyster, right? 

775
00:31:31,741 --> 00:31:33,841
- Oysters are cooked thoroughly. / - They're tiny oysters. 

776
00:31:33,841 --> 00:31:34,908
- They're cooked thoroughly. / - I see. 

777
00:31:34,908 --> 00:31:37,141
Then at the end, they fry the oyster... 

778
00:31:37,608 --> 00:31:39,974
- With eggs. / - Yes. 

779
00:31:39,974 --> 00:31:41,341
- Then they're mixed. / - The oysters... 

780
00:31:41,841 --> 00:31:44,874
Are very small like Korean oysters. 

781
00:31:45,174 --> 00:31:46,874
Like this. 

782
00:31:46,874 --> 00:31:48,408
In the past, 

783
00:31:48,408 --> 00:31:51,608
Seosan's salted oyster with pepper was this small. 

784
00:31:51,608 --> 00:31:55,208
People made salted oyster with tiny oysters. 

785
00:31:55,208 --> 00:31:57,074
(What does Xiamen's oyster taste like?) 

786
00:31:57,074 --> 00:31:59,041
(Heeeun is shocked) 

787
00:31:59,041 --> 00:32:01,641
If you haven't tasted the old oysters... 

788
00:32:01,641 --> 00:32:03,208
- You can't compare. / - Goodness. 

789
00:32:03,208 --> 00:32:06,008
- It must be delicious. / - She knows that taste. 

790
00:32:06,008 --> 00:32:07,108
She knows it too. 

791
00:32:07,108 --> 00:32:09,608
I haven't tasted this in so long. 

792
00:32:09,608 --> 00:32:11,608
This kind of oysters can't be found anymore in Korea. 

793
00:32:11,608 --> 00:32:13,041
(It's a flavor from the past) 

794
00:32:13,041 --> 00:32:14,974
First, cook the oysters and green onion 

795
00:32:14,974 --> 00:32:17,241
on the frying pan for a while. 

796
00:32:17,574 --> 00:32:20,908
Then you stir the oysters around. 

797
00:32:20,908 --> 00:32:22,641
Once the oyster and green onion are cooked, 

798
00:32:22,641 --> 00:32:24,741
beat the eggs and pour over it. 

799
00:32:24,741 --> 00:32:27,574
You cook it until the egg is cooked. 

800
00:32:27,574 --> 00:32:30,108
- Look at these tiny oysters. / - Yes. 

801
00:32:31,641 --> 00:32:33,974
That was really fragrant and delicious. 

802
00:32:33,974 --> 00:32:36,241
- I'll have to go there. / - All that oyster... 

803
00:32:36,241 --> 00:32:37,674
And it costs $3.20. 

804
00:32:42,174 --> 00:32:43,774
(Heeeun's explosive response) 

805
00:32:43,774 --> 00:32:44,974
It's so good. 

806
00:32:46,708 --> 00:32:48,808
That must be really delicious. 

807
00:32:48,808 --> 00:32:53,241
Heeeun only does that when it's super delicious. 

808
00:32:53,241 --> 00:32:56,941
She says, "Mmm, not bad" when the food is good. 

809
00:32:56,941 --> 00:32:58,674
- That must be really good. / - When she hums... 

810
00:32:58,674 --> 00:33:00,308
- Then it's extremely good. / - Right? 

811
00:33:01,041 --> 00:33:02,208
Yes. 

812
00:33:04,908 --> 00:33:07,541
It's so good. 

813
00:33:09,141 --> 00:33:11,074
(How good is it?) 

814
00:33:13,974 --> 00:33:16,041
It must be hard to peel all the oysters though. 

815
00:33:16,041 --> 00:33:17,274
I highly recommend this. 

816
00:33:17,274 --> 00:33:19,541
- We recommend it. / - If you remember... 

817
00:33:19,541 --> 00:33:23,474
The taste of salted oyster from the old days... 

818
00:33:23,474 --> 00:33:26,441
It's the same oyster but it's cooked. 

819
00:33:28,774 --> 00:33:30,774
You look like you went there to try every food. 

820
00:33:32,774 --> 00:33:36,008
- That looks good. / - That really looks good. 

821
00:33:36,008 --> 00:33:39,608
- You don't need anything else. / - It's that good. 

822
00:33:39,608 --> 00:33:42,308
You must try the oyster fritter when you're here. 

823
00:33:42,308 --> 00:33:45,274
Even though I had breakfast, this is good. 

824
00:33:45,274 --> 00:33:48,008
You can eat again in 2 hours. 

825
00:33:49,674 --> 00:33:51,408
I don't eat as much because I'm old now. 

826
00:33:53,108 --> 00:33:54,474
Our mom said... 

827
00:33:54,908 --> 00:33:56,941
Heeeun ate five meals a day. 

828
00:33:56,941 --> 00:33:58,408
- When I was young? / - Yes. 

829
00:33:58,408 --> 00:34:00,441
I'm like this because I stretched my stomach out 

830
00:34:00,441 --> 00:34:02,141
so much when I was young. 

831
00:34:04,308 --> 00:34:05,741
- Alright. / - Peanut soup. 

832
00:34:05,741 --> 00:34:06,874
(Peanut soup is next) 

833
00:34:08,174 --> 00:34:09,408
- Peanut soup? / - That's their specialty. 

834
00:34:09,408 --> 00:34:11,674
Because Xiamen is by the sea... 

835
00:34:11,674 --> 00:34:13,174
- Peanuts grow well. / - Yes. 

836
00:34:21,574 --> 00:34:22,741
Why is it sweet? 

837
00:34:22,941 --> 00:34:24,008
I told you it was sweet. 

838
00:34:25,608 --> 00:34:26,874
There is... 

839
00:34:28,074 --> 00:34:30,108
No trace of peanuts. You don't need to chew. 

840
00:34:30,108 --> 00:34:31,341
It's so soft. 

841
00:34:31,341 --> 00:34:33,241
It's very clean. 

842
00:34:33,241 --> 00:34:35,641
It's like porridge made of rice. 

843
00:34:35,641 --> 00:34:39,774
Hard peanuts have been boiled for a long time. 

844
00:34:39,774 --> 00:34:42,008
So the peanuts are mushy. 

845
00:34:42,008 --> 00:34:42,841
They started boiling it at night and 

846
00:34:42,841 --> 00:34:44,008
turned it off in the morning. 

847
00:34:49,174 --> 00:34:51,574
- I don't like the sweetness. / - It could be good. 

848
00:34:57,841 --> 00:34:59,374
I came home and cooked that. 

849
00:34:59,374 --> 00:35:01,941
- Until it becomes mushy. / - I tried it. 

850
00:35:01,941 --> 00:35:04,074
When peanuts get thoroughly cooked... 

851
00:35:04,074 --> 00:35:07,308
- They become like fermented soybeans. / - I see. 

852
00:35:07,308 --> 00:35:08,808
- They fall apart. / - They get soft. 

853
00:35:09,441 --> 00:35:10,508
It's sweet. 

854
00:35:10,508 --> 00:35:12,208
Chinese people love beans. 

855
00:35:12,208 --> 00:35:13,474
- Yes. / - I used... 

856
00:35:13,841 --> 00:35:16,541
Oat milk to make that soup at home. 

857
00:35:16,541 --> 00:35:18,208
- It was good. Yes. / - It tasted similar? 

858
00:35:18,208 --> 00:35:18,974
People who cook well 

859
00:35:18,974 --> 00:35:21,108
know how the food is made after tasting it. 

860
00:35:21,108 --> 00:35:22,574
You know how it's combined. 

861
00:35:23,441 --> 00:35:25,508
Try the vegetable rolls. 

862
00:35:28,408 --> 00:35:29,808
- I want to try that. / - That was good. 

863
00:35:29,808 --> 00:35:32,541
- Goodness. / - They're vegetable rolls. 

864
00:35:39,874 --> 00:35:42,508
- Heeeun, this is good. / - It looks delicious. 

865
00:35:43,141 --> 00:35:45,041
You can taste all the vegetables. 

866
00:35:46,541 --> 00:35:48,508
It has a bit of cilantro in it. 

867
00:35:49,441 --> 00:35:51,074
It's only a tiny bit 

868
00:35:51,074 --> 00:35:52,641
so no one can recognize it. 

869
00:35:53,108 --> 00:35:55,041
This was a great choice. 

870
00:35:55,541 --> 00:35:57,574
- What do we call this? / - A wheat wrap. 

871
00:35:58,241 --> 00:36:00,974
You can find wheat wraps at dim sum places. 

872
00:36:00,974 --> 00:36:05,041
They use tapioca starch to make the rolls chewy, 

873
00:36:05,041 --> 00:36:08,141
but this one tastes like it has more flour in it. 

874
00:36:11,041 --> 00:36:12,974
- Seriously. They don't stop. / - What? 

875
00:36:12,974 --> 00:36:15,574
- We kept eating. / - It was because it was delicious. 

876
00:36:15,574 --> 00:36:16,708
We were just filming ourselves eating. 

877
00:36:16,708 --> 00:36:20,274
- People who eat a lot, pick great dishes. / - True. 

878
00:36:20,274 --> 00:36:21,708
- They have experience. / - They know what's good. 

879
00:36:21,708 --> 00:36:24,341
- That one was really delicious. / - That looks good. 

880
00:36:26,841 --> 00:36:30,541
(Pork bone broth with peanut powder, condensed milk) 

881
00:36:30,874 --> 00:36:33,674
- Only $7.30 when it has abalone in it? / - Yes. 

882
00:36:34,008 --> 00:36:35,674
That's the best for your hangover. 

883
00:36:35,674 --> 00:36:37,608
Does this broth have peanut too? 

884
00:36:39,341 --> 00:36:40,441
I bet it has peanut. 

885
00:36:40,441 --> 00:36:42,141
- Yes. / - They're famous for peanuts. 

886
00:36:44,574 --> 00:36:45,774
- This is nice. / - Yes. 

887
00:36:48,541 --> 00:36:51,408
I can taste that there are no artificial seasonings. 

888
00:36:51,408 --> 00:36:53,941
They used the abalone to make the broth. 

889
00:36:53,941 --> 00:36:55,708
That looks like spicy seafood noodles. 

890
00:36:55,708 --> 00:36:57,474
Yes, it looks like spicy seafood noodles. 

891
00:36:58,574 --> 00:37:01,541
(She drinks it from the bowl) 

892
00:37:04,341 --> 00:37:05,841
(In agony) 

893
00:37:07,008 --> 00:37:09,108
Jisoo's completely immersed right now. 

894
00:37:09,108 --> 00:37:11,808
I really like spicy seafood noodles. 

895
00:37:11,808 --> 00:37:13,141
And since it looks like it... 

896
00:37:13,141 --> 00:37:14,841
- It does. / - I want to try that. 

897
00:37:14,841 --> 00:37:16,141
(The very sight arouses her appetite) 

898
00:37:17,441 --> 00:37:18,774
(What's this?) 

899
00:37:18,774 --> 00:37:20,608
That's fishcake. 

900
00:37:23,774 --> 00:37:24,774
Is it not? 

901
00:37:25,374 --> 00:37:27,074
- Is it rice cake? / - It's meat. 

902
00:37:27,074 --> 00:37:28,274
- It's meat? / - Gosh. 

903
00:37:28,274 --> 00:37:29,908
There's meat inside the fishcake? 

904
00:37:29,908 --> 00:37:31,641
(Let's share delicious food) 

905
00:37:31,641 --> 00:37:33,641
This is so delicious. It's really good. 

906
00:37:33,641 --> 00:37:34,741
It's good. 

907
00:37:35,074 --> 00:37:36,541
After eating the oyster fritter, 

908
00:37:36,541 --> 00:37:38,174
everything else tastes plain. 

909
00:37:38,741 --> 00:37:41,274
- You must have that last. / - Eat the fritters last. 

910
00:37:41,274 --> 00:37:44,341
- The order is important. / - Eat it in that order. 

911
00:37:44,608 --> 00:37:47,241
Let's calculate how much our meal costs. 

912
00:37:47,541 --> 00:37:49,974
This is 45? 

913
00:37:49,974 --> 00:37:51,441
- This costs 20. / - I want to go back there. 

914
00:37:51,774 --> 00:37:52,874
- Again. / - It's like... 

915
00:37:52,874 --> 00:37:54,108
I really want to have that. 

916
00:37:54,108 --> 00:37:57,408
People can order this one and share. 

917
00:37:57,808 --> 00:37:59,808
I won't order that. Instead of ordering that, 

918
00:37:59,808 --> 00:38:00,841
I would go with the vegetable wrap, 

919
00:38:00,841 --> 00:38:03,008
peanut soup and oyster fritters. 

920
00:38:03,008 --> 00:38:04,874
I think that combination would suffice. 

921
00:38:04,874 --> 00:38:06,641
They can have this meal for 30 yuan. 

922
00:38:06,641 --> 00:38:07,608
That's right. 

923
00:38:07,608 --> 00:38:10,708
This recommendation is based on Heekyeong's 

924
00:38:10,708 --> 00:38:12,508
and my food preferences. 

925
00:38:12,508 --> 00:38:14,941
Food preferences are very subjective. 

926
00:38:14,941 --> 00:38:17,141
- It's subjective. / - It's a personal choice. 

927
00:38:17,141 --> 00:38:20,074
We'd like to tell you that this is subjective and biased. 

928
00:38:20,074 --> 00:38:23,374
Since we have filled our stomachs... 

929
00:38:23,974 --> 00:38:25,774
- Let's go for a walk. / - Time for a walk. 

930
00:38:26,541 --> 00:38:28,974
There's this island called Gulangyu. 

931
00:38:29,341 --> 00:38:31,441
- We have to take the ferry. / - What? 

932
00:38:31,708 --> 00:38:32,708
We must go there by ferry. 

933
00:38:32,708 --> 00:38:35,174
There is this small island 

934
00:38:35,174 --> 00:38:37,208
near the coast of Xiamen. 

935
00:38:37,574 --> 00:38:39,174
That's Gulangyu. 

936
00:38:39,174 --> 00:38:42,541
- It takes 15 minutes by ferry. / - It's an island. 

937
00:38:44,241 --> 00:38:47,408
(The beach surrounds the island) 

938
00:38:47,408 --> 00:38:48,774
- There's a beach. / - My gosh. 

939
00:38:48,774 --> 00:38:49,908
(The small Europe in China with European architecture) 

940
00:38:49,908 --> 00:38:51,441
Gulangyu is like... 

941
00:38:51,441 --> 00:38:54,174
- A European city. / - That's right. 

942
00:38:54,174 --> 00:38:56,341
- It looks like Italy, doesn't it? / - That's right. 

943
00:38:56,341 --> 00:38:59,508
- Like Southern Italy. / - It's a UNESCO site. 

944
00:38:59,774 --> 00:39:01,841
There are many fusion restaurants. 

945
00:39:02,241 --> 00:39:05,441
There are cafes where tourists can rest at. 

946
00:39:05,441 --> 00:39:06,708
There is a museum too. 

947
00:39:06,708 --> 00:39:08,408
(Gulangyu) 

948
00:39:08,641 --> 00:39:10,708
- At last... / - At last... 

949
00:39:10,708 --> 00:39:12,708
We're at the ferry terminal. 

950
00:39:12,708 --> 00:39:15,374
They open at 7:20 a.m. 

951
00:39:15,374 --> 00:39:18,208
I thought we'd be okay since we got here at 7 a.m. 

952
00:39:18,208 --> 00:39:20,708
but this terminal is packed with people. 

953
00:39:20,708 --> 00:39:23,041
- "Gulangyu Ferry." / - It's like that here. 

954
00:39:23,974 --> 00:39:25,341
I have it on camera. 

955
00:39:27,174 --> 00:39:28,808
(They depart for Gulangyu) 

956
00:39:28,808 --> 00:39:30,174
The ferry is leaving now. 

957
00:39:31,674 --> 00:39:34,674
This city has traits of Asia, 

958
00:39:34,674 --> 00:39:36,941
China and Europe. 

959
00:39:36,941 --> 00:39:39,674
A bit of everything is mixed here. 

960
00:39:39,674 --> 00:39:41,141
(It's a destination with various charms) 

961
00:39:41,141 --> 00:39:42,641
So far, we haven't seen 

962
00:39:42,641 --> 00:39:46,074
any traditional Chinese houses or anything like that. 

963
00:39:46,074 --> 00:39:48,474
We are in the unique part of China. 

964
00:39:48,474 --> 00:39:50,008
This is Gulangyu. 

965
00:39:50,808 --> 00:39:51,908
- Right. / - Yes. 

966
00:39:51,908 --> 00:39:55,041
(They arrive at Gulangyu only after 15 minutes) 

967
00:39:55,408 --> 00:39:56,541
Look at the carts. 

968
00:39:57,841 --> 00:40:00,908
On this island, we'll visit the Piano Museum 

969
00:40:00,908 --> 00:40:02,408
and the flower garden. 

970
00:40:02,408 --> 00:40:04,208
- Was it called Shuzhuang Garden? / - Yes. 

971
00:40:04,208 --> 00:40:06,608
After that, we'll go to the beach. 

972
00:40:06,608 --> 00:40:08,674
Alright. When you arrive on this island, 

973
00:40:08,674 --> 00:40:11,841
there are no cars to protect this area. 

974
00:40:12,074 --> 00:40:15,408
Instead of cars, you can take the electric carts. 

975
00:40:16,974 --> 00:40:20,274
(The electric cart goes around the island) 

976
00:40:21,074 --> 00:40:22,841
Let's take the cart and look around. 

977
00:40:23,741 --> 00:40:26,374
Heeeun sounds almost a local guide. 

978
00:40:26,374 --> 00:40:28,341
- That's right. / - She has her backpack in front. 

979
00:40:29,741 --> 00:40:32,508
Being a guide is my dream. 

980
00:40:32,508 --> 00:40:35,441
It's so great to travel with her. 

981
00:40:35,441 --> 00:40:37,541
She explains everything to us. 

982
00:40:37,541 --> 00:40:40,374
You can see the palm trees on this island. 

983
00:40:40,374 --> 00:40:41,874
Look at that. Look at the roots. 

984
00:40:41,874 --> 00:40:44,074
You can see the roots here. 

985
00:40:44,308 --> 00:40:45,908
They painted the white stuff on the trees 

986
00:40:45,908 --> 00:40:48,241
to keep the bugs away. 

987
00:40:48,241 --> 00:40:49,774
That's what I heard. 

988
00:40:50,274 --> 00:40:52,041
She really explains everything to us. 

989
00:40:52,041 --> 00:40:57,474
(Under the cool leaves, they go through a tunnel) 

990
00:40:59,841 --> 00:41:03,408
(And the cool beach with palm trees unfolds) 

991
00:41:08,474 --> 00:41:09,841
Had the weather been clearer... 

992
00:41:10,374 --> 00:41:12,508
The scenery would have looked 

993
00:41:12,508 --> 00:41:14,441
clear and beautiful. 

994
00:41:15,074 --> 00:41:16,441
It might've looked clear and pretty 

995
00:41:16,441 --> 00:41:17,641
but it would've been hard for us. 

996
00:41:17,641 --> 00:41:19,941
That's right. We would've gotten tired easily. 

997
00:41:21,108 --> 00:41:22,374
I think we're here. 

998
00:41:22,374 --> 00:41:25,608
Now, we'll head to Shuzhuang Garden. 

999
00:41:27,741 --> 00:41:30,741
(A wealthy Taiwanese man built this private garden) 

1000
00:41:30,741 --> 00:41:33,541
(As he missed Lin Family Mansion and Garden) 

1001
00:41:33,941 --> 00:41:37,508
This is a private villa he built in 1913 

1002
00:41:37,508 --> 00:41:38,208
with his own money. 

1003
00:41:38,208 --> 00:41:39,808
It's called Shuzhuang Garden. 

1004
00:41:42,674 --> 00:41:44,374
(The only piano museum in China exists on the island) 

1005
00:41:44,374 --> 00:41:45,708
(As it's famously known for fostering many musicians) 

1006
00:41:45,708 --> 00:41:48,374
And on the island, there is this piano museum... 

1007
00:41:48,374 --> 00:41:49,774
- With 100 pianos. / - My gosh. 

1008
00:41:49,774 --> 00:41:51,408
- That's beautiful. / - Yes, it is indeed. 

1009
00:41:51,408 --> 00:41:53,441
- The only piano museum in China. / - Right. 

1010
00:41:53,841 --> 00:41:57,108
- We are the raincoat sisters. / - Sisters. 

1011
00:41:57,808 --> 00:41:59,941
What are you filming now? Are you filming me? 

1012
00:42:00,474 --> 00:42:02,108
Are you filming me with your camera? 

1013
00:42:02,108 --> 00:42:04,441
Am I filming you? Whatever. It's all good. 

1014
00:42:05,541 --> 00:42:07,074
Alright, Shuzhuang Garden. 

1015
00:42:07,374 --> 00:42:08,708
(Shuzhuang Garden admission fee, $4.90) 

1016
00:42:08,708 --> 00:42:10,674
- That's the sign. / - "Shuzhuang Garden." 

1017
00:42:11,141 --> 00:42:13,908
Gulangyu Piano Museum. Goodness. 

1018
00:42:13,908 --> 00:42:16,274
It's written in Korean. 

1019
00:42:17,208 --> 00:42:18,041
Let's go. 

1020
00:42:18,041 --> 00:42:21,441
Let's head over to the Piano Museum. 

1021
00:42:22,308 --> 00:42:24,874
(They cross over the 44 Bridge) 

1022
00:42:26,374 --> 00:42:28,308
Let's go. Let's climb up there. 

1023
00:42:34,374 --> 00:42:37,223
(Battle Trip Part 2 will be aired soon) 

1024
00:42:37,609 --> 00:42:40,176
(They cross over the 44 Bridge) 

1025
00:42:41,676 --> 00:42:43,609
Let's go. Let's climb up there. 

1026
00:42:54,176 --> 00:42:55,509
My goodness. 

1027
00:42:56,209 --> 00:42:57,542
Unbelievable. 

1028
00:42:58,476 --> 00:43:04,442
(The locals are enjoying the 44 Bridge and the beach) 

1029
00:43:06,142 --> 00:43:09,042
(It's a fantastic view of the garden with the beach) 

1030
00:43:09,709 --> 00:43:10,976
Let's go. 

1031
00:43:10,976 --> 00:43:12,309
(It takes 60 steps to the Piano Museum) 

1032
00:43:12,309 --> 00:43:13,742
I have to do the cheer. 

1033
00:43:15,709 --> 00:43:16,876
Let's go. 

1034
00:43:24,542 --> 00:43:29,676
(100 pianos collected from all over the world) 

1035
00:43:32,509 --> 00:43:35,576
(The largest piano museum in Asia) 

1036
00:43:35,576 --> 00:43:39,476
- The carvings are pretty. / - They did an amazing job. 

1037
00:43:43,709 --> 00:43:46,109
I think people from the old days were... 

1038
00:43:46,109 --> 00:43:48,776
- More dexterous than people now. / - Gosh. 

1039
00:43:48,776 --> 00:43:51,176
The keyboard is small compared to the soundboard. 

1040
00:43:52,442 --> 00:43:53,909
There aren't that many keys. 

1041
00:43:54,376 --> 00:43:57,309
They have a Steinway &amp; Sons here. 

1042
00:43:57,342 --> 00:43:59,176
(A unique piano that's hard to come by) 

1043
00:43:59,176 --> 00:44:01,642
This is such a collector's item. 

1044
00:44:01,942 --> 00:44:04,676
Look. There's a candlestick on the piano. 

1045
00:44:04,676 --> 00:44:08,442
When there was no electricity, to see the music sheet... 

1046
00:44:08,442 --> 00:44:11,276
- They put it on the piano body. / - I see. 

1047
00:44:11,276 --> 00:44:13,776
- The candlesticks were attached. / - Back in the day. 

1048
00:44:13,776 --> 00:44:15,676
- When they didn't have electricity. / - To play at night. 

1049
00:44:15,676 --> 00:44:17,042
(Laughing) 

1050
00:44:17,042 --> 00:44:18,009
How cute. 

1051
00:44:19,042 --> 00:44:21,109
Goodness, how dainty. 

1052
00:44:21,109 --> 00:44:22,876
I can't believe there's an L shaped piano. 

1053
00:44:25,209 --> 00:44:28,176
(What is that?) 

1054
00:44:28,776 --> 00:44:30,242
How did they make... 

1055
00:44:30,242 --> 00:44:32,809
- Something like that? / - How can you play it? 

1056
00:44:32,809 --> 00:44:33,476
You should play it like this. 

1057
00:44:33,476 --> 00:44:34,876
A double-keyboard piano. 

1058
00:44:34,876 --> 00:44:36,576
It's for the corner. 

1059
00:44:37,309 --> 00:44:39,809
- It's made for a corner. / - It's a decoration... 

1060
00:44:39,809 --> 00:44:42,076
- And a piano at the same time. / - My goodness. 

1061
00:44:42,476 --> 00:44:44,176
Look at these. 

1062
00:44:44,176 --> 00:44:45,776
These are double-keyboard pianos. 

1063
00:44:45,776 --> 00:44:47,109
(Double-keyboard piano) 

1064
00:44:47,842 --> 00:44:50,142
- The keys are black? / - The main keys are black. 

1065
00:44:50,142 --> 00:44:53,542
- They're reversed. / - I didn't notice it... 

1066
00:44:53,776 --> 00:44:56,376
- Because of the light. / - The colors are reversed. 

1067
00:44:56,576 --> 00:44:59,876
Why did they make it like this? How interesting. 

1068
00:45:04,776 --> 00:45:08,576
(Right then, a piano stood out to them) 

1069
00:45:09,076 --> 00:45:11,909
1788? 

1070
00:45:11,909 --> 00:45:15,676
My goodness, this is amazing. 

1071
00:45:15,676 --> 00:45:17,042
It's the oldest piano. 

1072
00:45:17,042 --> 00:45:18,976
It looks like an old record player. 

1073
00:45:20,176 --> 00:45:22,176
1788. 

1074
00:45:22,176 --> 00:45:23,609
Look at the piano strings. 

1075
00:45:23,609 --> 00:45:25,709
The strings are usually vertical. 

1076
00:45:25,709 --> 00:45:27,942
But this one is horizontal. 

1077
00:45:29,109 --> 00:45:32,742
(Heeeun is lost in thought looking at the old piano) 

1078
00:45:33,909 --> 00:45:37,709
When I was young, mom told me to learn piano. 

1079
00:45:38,609 --> 00:45:41,342
But I told her my head hurt and just ran away. 

1080
00:45:41,342 --> 00:45:43,709
My head actually hurt so much. 

1081
00:45:44,476 --> 00:45:48,809
But at some point, I started to regret that I didn't learn. 

1082
00:45:48,809 --> 00:45:50,176
Me too. 

1083
00:45:50,176 --> 00:45:52,176
Ever since I learned about the world 

1084
00:45:52,176 --> 00:45:56,809
and realized how important early education is... 

1085
00:45:57,142 --> 00:45:59,976
I regret hating piano so much 

1086
00:45:59,976 --> 00:46:03,176
and always running away. 

1087
00:46:03,842 --> 00:46:08,009
(The old piano reminded Heeeun of her memories) 

1088
00:46:08,376 --> 00:46:10,742
Those who learned it and can play it 

1089
00:46:10,742 --> 00:46:11,842
must be so happy. 

1090
00:46:11,842 --> 00:46:14,342
She must be especially happy to play 

1091
00:46:14,342 --> 00:46:15,576
such a special piano. 

1092
00:46:16,109 --> 00:46:19,276
She can play a piano that others can't. 

1093
00:46:19,276 --> 00:46:21,342
- They even play it for you? / - Yes. 

1094
00:46:23,142 --> 00:46:24,409
You're not allowed to touch 

1095
00:46:24,409 --> 00:46:25,976
the pianos in the museum? 

1096
00:46:25,976 --> 00:46:27,109
- No. / - Except for that person, right? 

1097
00:46:27,109 --> 00:46:28,142
- That's right. / - You're not allowed. 

1098
00:46:29,042 --> 00:46:31,409
(How would a piano from 1937 sound?) 

1099
00:46:33,442 --> 00:46:38,109
(From 9 till 4, there's a performance every hour) 

1100
00:46:39,942 --> 00:46:41,909
It sounds... 

1101
00:46:42,609 --> 00:46:45,809
The piano sounds wonderful. 

1102
00:46:48,242 --> 00:46:53,009
(The mature sound of the piano) 

1103
00:46:58,176 --> 00:47:03,576
(Brings back her memories and yearning for piano) 

1104
00:47:18,342 --> 00:47:21,342
This piano is 81 years old. 

1105
00:47:21,342 --> 00:47:24,042
- It was made in 1937. / - It was born in 1937. 

1106
00:47:24,042 --> 00:47:26,042
But it sounds great. 

1107
00:47:26,042 --> 00:47:29,109
It has a deep sound. I like it. 

1108
00:47:30,342 --> 00:47:32,742
When I become 81, 

1109
00:47:32,742 --> 00:47:36,242
will my voice still be stable like that? 

1110
00:47:36,242 --> 00:47:38,909
- Yes, it will. / - Do you think I can hang on? 

1111
00:47:39,309 --> 00:47:41,442
Just keep doing how you've been doing. 

1112
00:47:41,976 --> 00:47:44,776
You'd better worry about your health more. 

1113
00:47:45,209 --> 00:47:47,476
Let's go. Let's go out. 

1114
00:47:48,909 --> 00:47:50,309
Are you going to eat again? 

1115
00:47:50,309 --> 00:47:52,109
You just ate something. You're eating again? 

1116
00:47:52,109 --> 00:47:53,442
Come on. That's... 

1117
00:47:53,442 --> 00:47:55,942
After climbing 100 stairs, you get hungry. 

1118
00:47:55,942 --> 00:47:57,242
Exactly. 

1119
00:47:57,242 --> 00:47:59,309
- You get exhausted. / - What are you talking about? 

1120
00:47:59,309 --> 00:48:02,176
I found a place that looked quite nice. 

1121
00:48:02,809 --> 00:48:04,676
It's a fusion restaurant. 

1122
00:48:04,676 --> 00:48:05,942
(They will have fusion Chinese food) 

1123
00:48:05,942 --> 00:48:08,476
It's quite famous among Koreans. 

1124
00:48:09,176 --> 00:48:12,742
We could end up feeling betrayed. 

1125
00:48:13,442 --> 00:48:15,509
But I'd like to try this place anyway. 

1126
00:48:16,042 --> 00:48:19,409
(Port of Xiamen, fusion Chinese restaurant) 

1127
00:48:19,409 --> 00:48:20,909
- Fusion restaurant. / - Fusion restaurant. 

1128
00:48:20,909 --> 00:48:23,642
So this is a restaurant Heeeun found, right? 

1129
00:48:23,642 --> 00:48:24,942
Yes. 

1130
00:48:24,942 --> 00:48:28,042
She actually doesn't like fusion food. 

1131
00:48:28,909 --> 00:48:32,842
- But she decided to go there for me. / - Looks good. 

1132
00:48:34,476 --> 00:48:35,742
My gosh, it's so big. 

1133
00:48:36,676 --> 00:48:39,176
- The entrance looks impressive. / - Do we go up here? 

1134
00:48:39,176 --> 00:48:40,209
Yes. 

1135
00:48:41,209 --> 00:48:42,442
Do we go down? 

1136
00:48:42,442 --> 00:48:44,409
I don't like stairs. 

1137
00:48:45,609 --> 00:48:48,242
- What is this? / - This is the best of the best. 

1138
00:48:48,242 --> 00:48:51,076
- You're right. / - It says it's the best restaurant. 

1139
00:48:51,076 --> 00:48:54,942
It's in the top 100 restaurants in China. 

1140
00:48:54,942 --> 00:48:56,709
It made it into top 50 as well. 

1141
00:48:56,709 --> 00:48:58,876
If it's top 50 in China, isn't that a huge achievement? 

1142
00:48:58,876 --> 00:49:00,809
- It is. / - It's definitely something. 

1143
00:49:01,142 --> 00:49:04,576
It's a little too dark to be a restaurant. 

1144
00:49:04,576 --> 00:49:07,109
I just realized why. I'm wearing sunglasses. 

1145
00:49:07,109 --> 00:49:09,242
(It's dark plus she's wearing sunglasses) 

1146
00:49:09,242 --> 00:49:10,042
You're so funny. 

1147
00:49:10,042 --> 00:49:10,709
You complain that it's dark 

1148
00:49:10,709 --> 00:49:12,509
when you're wearing sunglasses. 

1149
00:49:15,176 --> 00:49:18,209
This place is very modern. 

1150
00:49:20,442 --> 00:49:22,609
- What is that? / - Quinoa salad. 

1151
00:49:22,609 --> 00:49:25,042
- That's right. / - There are so many choices. 

1152
00:49:26,009 --> 00:49:27,776
- Let's order it like that. / - Okay. 

1153
00:49:29,142 --> 00:49:30,242
Nihao. 

1154
00:49:30,476 --> 00:49:32,509
"Nihao." 

1155
00:49:35,442 --> 00:49:38,709
You make eye contact when you order. 

1156
00:49:39,142 --> 00:49:41,342
- She looks into his eyes. / - I like menus with pictures. 

1157
00:49:41,342 --> 00:49:43,109
- Right? / - Yes. 

1158
00:49:43,809 --> 00:49:46,309
I have high expectations. 

1159
00:49:46,309 --> 00:49:48,709
- I wonder how it will taste. / - My heart pounds. 

1160
00:49:49,809 --> 00:49:51,076
(A treasure chest shows up) 

1161
00:49:51,076 --> 00:49:52,709
- Oh, my. / - Wait a second. 

1162
00:49:52,709 --> 00:49:53,442
What is that? 

1163
00:49:54,176 --> 00:49:55,809
What is that? Is it a treasure chest? 

1164
00:49:55,809 --> 00:49:57,109
What is it? Is it a sauce? 

1165
00:49:57,109 --> 00:49:58,676
Are there pills in it? 

1166
00:49:59,042 --> 00:50:01,042
- No. / - It looks like there could be. 

1167
00:50:01,042 --> 00:50:03,676
Wait a second. It's a treasure chest. 

1168
00:50:04,409 --> 00:50:06,842
- Ta-da. / - What is it? 

1169
00:50:07,909 --> 00:50:10,309
The dry ice makes it look mysterious. 

1170
00:50:10,309 --> 00:50:12,509
I feel like I'll become like a spirit after eating this. 

1171
00:50:12,509 --> 00:50:13,542
That's not going to happen. 

1172
00:50:14,309 --> 00:50:15,676
We don't need to become spirits. 

1173
00:50:19,476 --> 00:50:22,309
Are the bottles in the front and back different? 

1174
00:50:22,309 --> 00:50:23,976
- Let me see. / - They seem different. 

1175
00:50:24,476 --> 00:50:26,342
The ones in the front and the ones in the back... 

1176
00:50:26,842 --> 00:50:28,976
I can't read what's written on it. 

1177
00:50:28,976 --> 00:50:31,376
Why do they give us 6 bottles? 

1178
00:50:31,376 --> 00:50:32,609
(What is this present that every customer gets?) 

1179
00:50:33,476 --> 00:50:36,309
Are we supposed to drink this between courses? 

1180
00:50:36,309 --> 00:50:38,176
- They all look the same. / - They do. 

1181
00:50:39,142 --> 00:50:40,976
Nothing is written on it. 

1182
00:50:40,976 --> 00:50:44,042
(Let's drink it first) 

1183
00:50:44,376 --> 00:50:46,476
(They react differently) 

1184
00:50:46,976 --> 00:50:48,476
It's sweet and sour mango. 

1185
00:50:48,476 --> 00:50:49,942
(It's mango flavor) 

1186
00:50:52,209 --> 00:50:53,242
Isn't it dandelion? 

1187
00:50:53,976 --> 00:50:55,042
Try mine. 

1188
00:50:56,542 --> 00:50:58,176
(I like it) 

1189
00:51:03,076 --> 00:51:04,076
(Her facial expression explains everything) 

1190
00:51:04,076 --> 00:51:06,409
- Her face tells everything. / - I love how she reacts. 

1191
00:51:07,076 --> 00:51:08,142
Her facial expression is so accurate. 

1192
00:51:15,776 --> 00:51:18,209
(Argh) 

1193
00:51:18,809 --> 00:51:20,142
What about the next one? 

1194
00:51:20,142 --> 00:51:21,609
- Everything else is the same. / - They're the same. 

1195
00:51:21,609 --> 00:51:24,176
Just one of them is bitter. 

1196
00:51:24,176 --> 00:51:25,509
It's a game of chance. 

1197
00:51:25,509 --> 00:51:27,309
You're right. Game of chance? 

1198
00:51:27,309 --> 00:51:28,742
Game of chance... 

1199
00:51:28,742 --> 00:51:30,576
I guess that's the case. 

1200
00:51:30,576 --> 00:51:32,276
This actually works up your appetite. 

1201
00:51:32,276 --> 00:51:33,276
I see. 

1202
00:51:33,276 --> 00:51:34,276
(These welcome drinks are served to all customers) 

1203
00:51:35,309 --> 00:51:36,342
Here it comes. 

1204
00:51:37,809 --> 00:51:41,109
(Social media master's essential step) 

1205
00:51:42,409 --> 00:51:44,976
My gosh, these are scallops. 

1206
00:51:45,376 --> 00:51:47,909
My goodness, look at this. 

1207
00:51:49,209 --> 00:51:50,542
These are scallops. 

1208
00:51:50,542 --> 00:51:52,276
- It has to be delicious. / - I love scallops. 

1209
00:51:52,276 --> 00:51:55,276
- It's a great combination. / - Is that an egg shell? 

1210
00:51:55,276 --> 00:51:57,442
- Yes. / - Is that custard cream? 

1211
00:51:57,442 --> 00:51:59,209
It looks amazing. 

1212
00:52:01,609 --> 00:52:04,309
Let me try a scallop. 

1213
00:52:05,442 --> 00:52:07,309
It looks quite nice, doesn't it? 

1214
00:52:07,909 --> 00:52:09,876
This must have been steamed. 

1215
00:52:13,342 --> 00:52:17,676
There weren't any exotic spices used. 

1216
00:52:17,676 --> 00:52:20,242
It was perfect for our tastes. 

1217
00:52:20,242 --> 00:52:21,742
I wonder what cream this is. 

1218
00:52:23,042 --> 00:52:24,409
- Potato. / - Potato soup. 

1219
00:52:25,942 --> 00:52:27,909
- It looks so delicious. / - That's a great idea. 

1220
00:52:27,909 --> 00:52:29,276
- It is. / - I like the presentation. 

1221
00:52:29,276 --> 00:52:32,142
- It must be fun to eat. / - They present dishes nicely. 

1222
00:52:36,942 --> 00:52:40,909
It's not easy to cook scallops this soft, right? 

1223
00:52:40,909 --> 00:52:42,542
It gets tough easily. 

1224
00:52:43,076 --> 00:52:45,276
I'm glad we ordered only two. 

1225
00:52:45,709 --> 00:52:47,776
Just tasting it is enough. 

1226
00:52:47,776 --> 00:52:51,009
Too many of these can be a little too heavy. 

1227
00:52:52,176 --> 00:52:53,642
I finished it. 

1228
00:52:55,509 --> 00:52:56,576
Next one. 

1229
00:52:56,576 --> 00:52:58,542
(What's the next dish?) 

1230
00:52:58,976 --> 00:53:01,009
- That's... / - What is that? 

1231
00:53:01,876 --> 00:53:03,376
- Truffle. / - Truffle. 

1232
00:53:03,376 --> 00:53:04,509
- Truffle? / - Yes. 

1233
00:53:04,509 --> 00:53:06,109
- It's a fish dish. / - It's fish. 

1234
00:53:06,109 --> 00:53:08,442
- It looks so delicious. / - Fried rice with truffle and fish. 

1235
00:53:08,442 --> 00:53:10,709
(Fried rice with truffle and fish, $11.20) 

1236
00:53:14,442 --> 00:53:16,676
It looks like halibut. 

1237
00:53:16,676 --> 00:53:18,042
(What would it taste like?) 

1238
00:53:19,142 --> 00:53:20,609
- It looks delicious. / - Let's see her face. 

1239
00:53:20,609 --> 00:53:23,109
If it's good, her face will tell. 

1240
00:53:23,109 --> 00:53:25,176
- This is delicious. / - It means it's delicious. 

1241
00:53:25,176 --> 00:53:28,342
It tastes mild and healthy. 

1242
00:53:28,876 --> 00:53:31,642
It's not too salty or sweet. 

1243
00:53:38,642 --> 00:53:41,876
Mijoo, keep it together. 

1244
00:53:41,876 --> 00:53:43,076
You had delicious food too, right? 

1245
00:53:43,076 --> 00:53:45,242
You're going to show us great food, right? 

1246
00:53:46,376 --> 00:53:48,309
(Solemn) 

1247
00:53:48,309 --> 00:53:49,709
They're not answering. 

1248
00:53:53,742 --> 00:53:55,876
I like the flavor of the soy sauce. 

1249
00:53:56,176 --> 00:53:58,942
It tastes similar to the Japanese rice with eel. 

1250
00:53:58,942 --> 00:54:01,242
- Their food is too salty. / - That's too salty. 

1251
00:54:01,242 --> 00:54:04,076
Japanese food is too salty. But this is fine. 

1252
00:54:04,476 --> 00:54:07,876
The fish seems to be salted. 

1253
00:54:07,876 --> 00:54:09,109
- Does it? / - It's a bit salty. 

1254
00:54:09,109 --> 00:54:12,276
- It's dried fish. / - It's delicious. 

1255
00:54:12,809 --> 00:54:14,976
Heeeun, I like the texture of the vegetable. 

1256
00:54:14,976 --> 00:54:15,976
(She fell in love with the fusion dishes) 

1257
00:54:15,976 --> 00:54:17,876
This tastes like mustard leaves. Try it. 

1258
00:54:19,876 --> 00:54:23,642
This vegetable is cooked but crunchy. I like that. 

1259
00:54:27,942 --> 00:54:30,809
This is impressive. It's unique. 

1260
00:54:30,809 --> 00:54:33,542
- This is quinoa salad. / - Yes, it is. 

1261
00:54:34,176 --> 00:54:36,442
- It looks pretty. / - I should take a picture of it... 

1262
00:54:36,442 --> 00:54:38,042
Like young people do. 

1263
00:54:41,276 --> 00:54:46,342
(You can enjoy the colorful dish with your eyes first) 

1264
00:54:46,342 --> 00:54:47,842
It's called the mother of the grains. 

1265
00:54:47,842 --> 00:54:50,176
It's getting a lot of attention as a superfood. 

1266
00:54:50,176 --> 00:54:51,676
(Quinoa salad, $6.30) 

1267
00:54:54,409 --> 00:54:55,742
What is quinoa? 

1268
00:54:55,742 --> 00:54:56,876
It's a type of grain. 

1269
00:54:57,309 --> 00:54:59,142
The one on the bottom is quinoa. 

1270
00:54:59,142 --> 00:55:02,209
It's very small. It's smaller than millet. 

1271
00:55:03,076 --> 00:55:07,242
- The one on the top is popped rice. / - It's popped rice. 

1272
00:55:07,242 --> 00:55:09,409
And on the bottom, 

1273
00:55:09,409 --> 00:55:12,376
there's quinoa mixed with blueberry yogurt. 

1274
00:55:12,376 --> 00:55:13,742
It looks delicious. 

1275
00:55:13,742 --> 00:55:16,609
The texture is very crunchy 

1276
00:55:16,609 --> 00:55:18,076
because of popped rice. 

1277
00:55:18,076 --> 00:55:21,576
The top 10 superfoods taste really bad. 

1278
00:55:21,576 --> 00:55:23,676
They are just healthy. 

1279
00:55:24,109 --> 00:55:27,276
- So making it taste nice is the skill. / - Right. 

1280
00:55:28,476 --> 00:55:32,442
(Will they enjoy this dish?) 

1281
00:55:39,576 --> 00:55:41,876
This is unique. I've never had a salad like this before. 

1282
00:55:42,442 --> 00:55:43,576
This is new. 

1283
00:55:44,776 --> 00:55:47,109
I liked the texture of the green leaves. 

1284
00:55:47,109 --> 00:55:49,476
- It contains a lot of water. / - It also looks unique. 

1285
00:55:49,476 --> 00:55:50,842
- I don't know what it is. / - We don't have it in Korea. 

1286
00:55:50,842 --> 00:55:52,676
It's a vegetable that we don't have here. 

1287
00:55:57,976 --> 00:56:00,709
The popped rice tastes savory. 

1288
00:56:01,142 --> 00:56:04,242
And it has fruits and vegetables on the bottom. 

1289
00:56:04,842 --> 00:56:07,742
I've never had anything like this before. 

1290
00:56:08,076 --> 00:56:11,142
I want to add popped rice in my salad too. 

1291
00:56:17,842 --> 00:56:19,142
This is my kind of thing. 

1292
00:56:19,542 --> 00:56:23,242
People think Chinese dishes are very greasy. 

1293
00:56:23,242 --> 00:56:25,342
But this wasn't greasy at all. 

1294
00:56:25,342 --> 00:56:29,576
They were refreshing Chinese fusion cuisine. 

1295
00:56:29,576 --> 00:56:33,409
We spent about $25 for two people. 

1296
00:56:33,409 --> 00:56:35,609
- It was definitely worth it. / - I think so too. 

1297
00:56:35,609 --> 00:56:37,809
It was an enjoyable meal. 

1298
00:56:38,242 --> 00:56:40,609
If we go to restaurants like that in Korea, 

1299
00:56:40,609 --> 00:56:42,209
it costs about $100 per person. 

1300
00:56:42,209 --> 00:56:43,442
It'd cost about that much. 

1301
00:56:43,442 --> 00:56:45,109
It looks like a fancy restaurant 

1302
00:56:45,109 --> 00:56:46,776
but the price is reasonable. 

1303
00:56:47,242 --> 00:56:48,676
Now we will go to... 

1304
00:56:49,509 --> 00:56:51,609
A cafe where we can travel through time. 

1305
00:56:52,709 --> 00:56:54,042
And they have good cakes. 

1306
00:56:54,242 --> 00:56:56,242
We are already traveling through time. 

1307
00:56:57,742 --> 00:56:59,176
If you think about it. 

1308
00:56:59,176 --> 00:57:01,109
We are traveling through time. 

1309
00:57:01,109 --> 00:57:04,142
Let's go there and eat something sweet. 

1310
00:57:04,942 --> 00:57:06,409
- We will enjoy it. / - Let's do that. 

1311
00:57:07,209 --> 00:57:09,409
I love the course that you've planned so far. 

1312
00:57:09,409 --> 00:57:10,176
- Do you like it? / - Yes. 

1313
00:57:10,176 --> 00:57:12,109
- Sook, do you like it? / - I love it. 

1314
00:57:12,109 --> 00:57:13,676
- Let's go together. / - Let's. 

1315
00:57:13,776 --> 00:57:16,476
I've never seen so many egrets before. 

1316
00:57:17,776 --> 00:57:18,842
They're moving. 

1317
00:57:19,109 --> 00:57:21,276
Some are sitting in the trees. So pretty. 

1318
00:57:21,276 --> 00:57:24,409
("So Good" by Yang Heeeun) 

1319
00:57:24,676 --> 00:57:26,842
The sunshine is so good. 

1320
00:57:26,842 --> 00:57:29,409
Sing that song. 

1321
00:57:30,276 --> 00:57:31,542
♪ It's so good ♪ 

1322
00:57:32,309 --> 00:57:35,442
♪ I feel so good because you're here ♪ 

1323
00:57:36,176 --> 00:57:41,042
♪ I'm thankful for you ♪ 

1324
00:57:41,042 --> 00:57:44,376
♪ Who always smiles by my side ♪ 

1325
00:57:44,376 --> 00:57:46,042
This is perfect. 

1326
00:57:46,042 --> 00:57:47,309
It looks so nice. 

1327
00:57:47,309 --> 00:57:49,909
It will be great to go there with your sibling. 

1328
00:57:49,909 --> 00:57:51,142
For about 3 days. 

1329
00:57:51,142 --> 00:57:52,476
You can have a lot of delicious foods. 

1330
00:57:52,476 --> 00:57:54,509
- The streets are so clean. / - They are clean. 

1331
00:57:54,509 --> 00:57:56,342
- It's quiet and nice. / - So clean. 

1332
00:57:56,342 --> 00:57:57,776
There is no trash on the street. 

1333
00:57:58,642 --> 00:58:01,276
- It's raining. / - I think this is it. 

1334
00:58:01,276 --> 00:58:04,009
- Is this it? / - This is the place. 

1335
00:58:04,009 --> 00:58:06,042
- It's called Goodone. / - Goodone? 

1336
00:58:06,042 --> 00:58:07,642
(This is the cafe Heeeun was talking about) 

1337
00:58:07,642 --> 00:58:08,709
The characters mean the light of time. 

1338
00:58:08,709 --> 00:58:09,776
Or shining time. 

1339
00:58:09,776 --> 00:58:11,609
Tea and coffee. 

1340
00:58:11,609 --> 00:58:13,842
Sweet dessert and drinks. 

1341
00:58:14,909 --> 00:58:17,909
(Heeeun loves pretty cafes) 

1342
00:58:23,542 --> 00:58:25,242
It's a two-story building. 

1343
00:58:25,242 --> 00:58:26,442
This is interesting. 

1344
00:58:26,442 --> 00:58:27,809
(It's a two-story building with colorful wallpaper) 

1345
00:58:27,809 --> 00:58:29,842
They made a deck with wooden boards. 

1346
00:58:29,842 --> 00:58:32,009
- But the boards are old and rotten. / - Yes. 

1347
00:58:32,009 --> 00:58:34,142
So they covered it with tiles. 

1348
00:58:34,142 --> 00:58:37,009
- It's a substitution. / - So you don't fall through. 

1349
00:58:37,009 --> 00:58:39,209
There are tracks of time. 

1350
00:58:39,209 --> 00:58:40,442
Look at the chairs. 

1351
00:58:40,442 --> 00:58:42,476
They have traces of time. 

1352
00:58:42,476 --> 00:58:44,576
I guess they are very old chairs. 

1353
00:58:44,576 --> 00:58:46,042
It's good that they have low chair legs. 

1354
00:58:46,042 --> 00:58:49,176
- Heeeun, if we stay here... / - Western people... 

1355
00:58:49,176 --> 00:58:51,709
The wooden boards might break. Let's just get in. 

1356
00:58:52,242 --> 00:58:54,009
- It's shaking. / - I know. 

1357
00:58:54,009 --> 00:58:56,509
What if I break it and they want me to pay for it? 

1358
00:58:56,509 --> 00:58:58,409
- You might have to pay for the tiles. / - I can't do that. 

1359
00:58:58,809 --> 00:59:01,876
- My gosh. / - This place looks beautiful. 

1360
00:59:05,342 --> 00:59:08,776
It feels like sitting in a living room. 

1361
00:59:08,776 --> 00:59:11,409
Everything in there is mismatched. 

1362
00:59:11,909 --> 00:59:17,709
It's like decades of time gathered in one place. 

1363
00:59:18,942 --> 00:59:20,342
- It's pretty. / - They are... 

1364
00:59:20,342 --> 00:59:22,509
The things that grandparents 

1365
00:59:22,509 --> 00:59:24,709
and great-grandparents would've used. 

1366
00:59:25,876 --> 00:59:28,176
This place doesn't look like China. 

1367
00:59:28,176 --> 00:59:29,942
- It doesn't. / - It's not typical. 

1368
00:59:31,976 --> 00:59:34,476
What do you think about this cafe? Don't you like it? 

1369
00:59:34,476 --> 00:59:37,542
Everything we used to have in our house is here. 

1370
00:59:37,542 --> 00:59:41,342
It feels like we're sitting in the living room, not a cafe. 

1371
00:59:41,342 --> 00:59:42,442
I know. 

1372
00:59:42,442 --> 00:59:43,942
I think that's the point. 

1373
00:59:43,942 --> 00:59:47,642
The owner didn't buy new furniture. 

1374
00:59:47,642 --> 00:59:51,109
She just gathered up some used furniture. 

1375
00:59:51,842 --> 00:59:53,809
(Unsure) 

1376
00:59:56,076 --> 00:59:58,876
(The dessert is finally being served) 

1377
00:59:59,176 --> 01:00:01,809
- She looks really happy. / - Goodness. 

1378
01:00:01,809 --> 01:00:03,242
- Goodness... / - Her voice got higher. 

1379
01:00:03,242 --> 01:00:04,542
- The dessert... / - It's so pretty. 

1380
01:00:04,542 --> 01:00:06,576
Gosh, even the forks are small. 

1381
01:00:07,209 --> 01:00:09,876
It's the perfect size for my build. 

1382
01:00:12,409 --> 01:00:15,142
- Thank you. / - It's tiny. 

1383
01:00:15,142 --> 01:00:17,942
They don't serve slices. 

1384
01:00:17,942 --> 01:00:19,142
It's a small cake. 

1385
01:00:19,742 --> 01:00:22,109
- It looks delicious. / - What is that? 

1386
01:00:22,109 --> 01:00:23,776
- It was really good. / - It looks like pudding. 

1387
01:00:23,776 --> 01:00:25,576
- I can eat it at a mouthful. / - Right, one mouthful. 

1388
01:00:26,942 --> 01:00:28,109
You're right. 

1389
01:00:28,109 --> 01:00:29,876
So pretty. 

1390
01:00:29,876 --> 01:00:33,209
(Mango mousse egg cake, star cake, Budapest) 

1391
01:00:35,142 --> 01:00:37,409
(Fruit tea, $6) 

1392
01:00:37,676 --> 01:00:39,342
It's good. It has the taste of nature. 

1393
01:00:40,576 --> 01:00:41,276
It's great, isn't it? 

1394
01:00:41,809 --> 01:00:45,342
They didn't add sugar or artificial sweeteners. 

1395
01:00:45,876 --> 01:00:46,909
It tastes healthy. 

1396
01:00:47,942 --> 01:00:51,809
- The sweetness from fruits is different. / - Yeah? 

1397
01:00:51,809 --> 01:00:54,176
You should stop talking and taste this. 

1398
01:00:54,742 --> 01:00:57,476
Is it lemon, strawberry and coffee flavor? 

1399
01:00:58,076 --> 01:01:01,276
I think it is chocolate or something. 

1400
01:01:02,542 --> 01:01:06,442
(Golden stars on sweet chocolate mousse) 

1401
01:01:06,442 --> 01:01:09,009
(It's stuffed with strawberry jam and cream) 

1402
01:01:10,976 --> 01:01:13,176
(They take a big together) 

1403
01:01:15,642 --> 01:01:17,309
(One more bite for me) 

1404
01:01:17,309 --> 01:01:18,942
(One more bite for me as well) 

1405
01:01:19,309 --> 01:01:21,976
I guess the owner is a naturalist. 

1406
01:01:22,509 --> 01:01:24,576
Even the cake is not too sweet. 

1407
01:01:25,176 --> 01:01:26,676
That's why I liked it. 

1408
01:01:26,676 --> 01:01:28,209
- It's not sweet? / - No. 

1409
01:01:28,309 --> 01:01:30,042
It has a natural sweet taste. 

1410
01:01:30,342 --> 01:01:33,209
I think it's good for people of our age. 

1411
01:01:35,342 --> 01:01:38,009
- This one looks good too. / - Mango mousse egg cake. 

1412
01:01:38,476 --> 01:01:39,876
- Mango mousse egg cake. / - So pretty. 

1413
01:01:39,876 --> 01:01:41,776
- People my age don't like things... / - Wow. 

1414
01:01:41,776 --> 01:01:43,876
- That are too sweet. / - Stop being so impressed. 

1415
01:01:43,876 --> 01:01:45,309
Hey, are you alright? 

1416
01:01:45,309 --> 01:01:46,976
- I love cakes. / - I love it. 

1417
01:01:47,609 --> 01:01:48,842
My gosh. 

1418
01:01:48,842 --> 01:01:50,576
You should go to Xiamen. 

1419
01:01:51,476 --> 01:01:53,276
- I shouldn't do this. / - Restrain yourself. 

1420
01:01:55,109 --> 01:01:58,976
(It's time to try the mango mousse egg cake) 

1421
01:02:03,142 --> 01:02:05,442
(How does it taste?) 

1422
01:02:09,276 --> 01:02:12,342
(Sweet flavor of coconut in mango mousse) 

1423
01:02:13,642 --> 01:02:15,809
This is a healing moment. 

1424
01:02:15,809 --> 01:02:19,476
Young people like to go to bars 

1425
01:02:19,476 --> 01:02:22,176
and have local craft beer. 

1426
01:02:22,176 --> 01:02:26,642
- They do that. / - And they order French fries. 

1427
01:02:26,642 --> 01:02:29,009
But that's not for us. 

1428
01:02:29,376 --> 01:02:32,142
We just want to drink some fruit tea 

1429
01:02:32,142 --> 01:02:34,409
that's hard to make at home. 

1430
01:02:40,642 --> 01:02:42,642
After you eat like that... 

1431
01:02:42,642 --> 01:02:44,409
- You go jogging at night? / - No. 

1432
01:02:44,676 --> 01:02:46,642
- Why waste energy on jogging? / - Jog where? 

1433
01:02:47,309 --> 01:02:49,576
- It's expensive to put on weight. / - She'll lose weight. 

1434
01:02:52,076 --> 01:02:55,609
(The sisters have a relaxing time together) 

1435
01:02:57,776 --> 01:03:02,676
(In a place where they lose track of the time) 

1436
01:03:04,809 --> 01:03:09,042
(They are absorbed in old memories) 

1437
01:03:09,509 --> 01:03:12,309
(Unexpected Gift Tour's trip down memory lane) 

1438
01:03:12,309 --> 01:03:15,909
Every woman who has a younger sister 

1439
01:03:15,909 --> 01:03:16,976
is envious of Heeeun. 

1440
01:03:16,976 --> 01:03:18,609
That she has a sister like me. 

1441
01:03:19,476 --> 01:03:21,409
I just do as I'm told. 

1442
01:03:21,409 --> 01:03:23,042
(She's right) 

1443
01:03:23,209 --> 01:03:25,142
"I heard this is good." 

1444
01:03:25,142 --> 01:03:26,709
"You should try this." 

1445
01:03:27,309 --> 01:03:29,709
Then I do as she tells me to do. 

1446
01:03:30,876 --> 01:03:32,009
Then... 

1447
01:03:32,009 --> 01:03:34,209
I tell her that it is really good. 

1448
01:03:34,209 --> 01:03:36,976
- "Really? I should try it then." / - Like a court lady. 

1449
01:03:37,776 --> 01:03:39,542
- A court lady? / - When we were young... 

1450
01:03:39,542 --> 01:03:41,709
She teased me like this all the time. 

1451
01:03:42,709 --> 01:03:43,909
Every day. 

1452
01:03:43,909 --> 01:03:46,409
When I was asleep... 

1453
01:03:47,109 --> 01:03:50,709
She squeezed paint on my face. 

1454
01:03:50,709 --> 01:03:53,509
As it dried, my face felt tighter. 

1455
01:03:53,509 --> 01:03:56,609
So I rubbed my face like this. 

1456
01:03:56,609 --> 01:03:58,576
And she was watching it laughing. 

1457
01:04:00,509 --> 01:04:03,409
I was once on a seesaw with my friends. 

1458
01:04:03,409 --> 01:04:05,076
And the second Heeeun sat on the seesaw, 

1459
01:04:05,076 --> 01:04:07,109
we bounced out. 

1460
01:04:07,109 --> 01:04:09,109
Because she was a lot heavier than us. 

1461
01:04:09,542 --> 01:04:12,409
As I fell to the ground, 

1462
01:04:12,409 --> 01:04:15,642
I hit my arm on a rock and broke my wrist. 

1463
01:04:16,309 --> 01:04:19,309
I didn't mean to do that though. I was pretty silly. 

1464
01:04:19,309 --> 01:04:21,809
There was a bonesetter I visited a lot. 

1465
01:04:22,409 --> 01:04:23,376
In the old MBC building. 

1466
01:04:23,376 --> 01:04:25,542
That's why I remember MBC. 

1467
01:04:25,542 --> 01:04:28,242
Back then, they would pull like this. 

1468
01:04:28,242 --> 01:04:30,009
- They stretched tightly. / - That would've hurt a lot. 

1469
01:04:30,009 --> 01:04:31,009
To set my bones. 

1470
01:04:31,009 --> 01:04:32,076
- They did it like that in the past. / - How painful. 

1471
01:04:32,076 --> 01:04:33,442
It really hurt. 

1472
01:04:34,109 --> 01:04:36,342
- You were mischievous. / - When you were young? 

1473
01:04:36,976 --> 01:04:39,409
- We finished eating. / - Yes. 

1474
01:04:40,009 --> 01:04:41,742
The place you wanted to visit the most. 

1475
01:04:42,076 --> 01:04:43,176
The market! 

1476
01:04:43,276 --> 01:04:44,142
The night market. 

1477
01:04:44,409 --> 01:04:46,842
Let's head towards the night market. 

1478
01:04:46,842 --> 01:04:48,176
- Let's go. / - Let's go. 

1479
01:04:48,576 --> 01:04:49,609
Time to charge. 

1480
01:04:49,609 --> 01:04:51,709
There is a night market. 

1481
01:04:52,676 --> 01:04:54,842
Isn't the cafe similar to her house? 

1482
01:04:55,742 --> 01:04:57,209
- Did you move to the next room? / - Yes. 

1483
01:04:57,209 --> 01:04:58,276
- You're right. / - The next room. 

1484
01:04:58,842 --> 01:05:01,842
- Just like that vintage cafe. / - Night market? 

1485
01:05:01,842 --> 01:05:04,209
- We should see the ingredients. / - That's right. 

1486
01:05:04,209 --> 01:05:07,309
We should also taste the food they make there. 

1487
01:05:07,309 --> 01:05:10,876
I want to watch what they eat and how they live. 

1488
01:05:11,376 --> 01:05:13,842
How happy will we be if we succeed? 

1489
01:05:13,842 --> 01:05:15,709
- That's right. It's cheap. / - Cheap and good quality.

- They did so much. / - Night markets are nice. 

1493
01:05:20,076 --> 01:05:21,709
- Night markets. / - Will they eat everything there? 

1494
01:05:21,709 --> 01:05:23,242
Yes, they have to. 

1495
01:05:25,709 --> 01:05:27,142
This is to my liking. 

1496
01:05:27,642 --> 01:05:30,909
They have every food that Xiamen has. 

1497
01:05:32,509 --> 01:05:33,509
Even insects. 

1498
01:05:33,509 --> 01:05:35,509
Even Taiwanese food is there. 

1499
01:05:35,709 --> 01:05:37,876
They even have every food from Taiwan.

It's really hard for the Lovelyz right now.

- Is that pork hock? / - But it's really clean.

- It's clean. / - I see.

1506
01:05:54,009 --> 01:05:56,309
- The lamps are pretty. / - Yeah. 

1507
01:05:57,242 --> 01:05:59,042
They not only sell food 

1508
01:05:59,042 --> 01:06:00,576
but also sell a lot of souvenirs. 

1509
01:06:01,376 --> 01:06:04,642

- We don't understand. / - We don't understand.

- What is that? / - What is that? 

1516

- Is it jelly? / - Is it royal jelly?

That's right, like muk. 

1536
01:07:05,976 --> 01:07:07,109

01:07:13,809 --> 01:07:15,209
Look at her face. 

1540
01:07:15,776 --> 01:07:17,709
- She doesn't like it. / - The gelatin must be good. 

1541
01:07:19,109 --> 01:07:22,709
(Don't talk about the taste unless you've tried it) 

1542
01:07:22,709 --> 01:07:23,776
Try it. 

1543
01:07:23,776 --> 01:07:24,742
(Heekyeong is an obedient younger sister) 

1544
01:07:24,742 --> 01:07:26,542
It tastes really good. 

1545
01:07:27,276 --> 01:07:30,076
(Unpleasant) 

1546
01:07:30,076 --> 01:07:32,709
I can't be the only one who tries this. It's okay. 

1547
01:07:33,376 --> 01:07:34,409
Try it. 

1548
01:07:34,409 --> 01:07:36,076
- Shoot it. / - I am. 

1549
01:07:36,076 --> 01:07:38,076
The poor camera director. 

1550
01:07:38,076 --> 01:07:40,042
His face doesn't look good. 

1551
01:07:41,176 --> 01:07:43,509
- He's scratching his head. / - It doesn't smell. 

1552
01:07:45,142 --> 01:07:46,309
It doesn't smell at all. 

1553
01:07:46,309 --> 01:07:47,776
- It doesn't have a smell. / - No. 

1554
01:07:48,742 --> 01:07:51,776
(What is the next thing to eat at the night market?) 

1555
01:07:52,676 --> 01:07:55,242
(Wait a minute) 

1556
01:07:56,342 --> 01:07:58,809
- I like this. / - Me too. 

1557
01:07:59,242 --> 01:08:01,342
- These are rice noodle roll. / - Me too. 

1558
01:08:02,376 --> 01:08:05,476
They mix shrimp with flour... 

1559
01:08:07,809 --> 01:08:09,609
And rolls it up 

1560
01:08:09,609 --> 01:08:12,842
like crepes. 

1561
01:08:12,976 --> 01:08:14,642
- Looks so good. / - With sweet soy sauce. 

1562
01:08:14,642 --> 01:08:16,709
- That's right. / - It tastes slightly sweet. 

1563
01:08:16,709 --> 01:08:18,409
That looks really good. 

1564
01:08:18,409 --> 01:08:19,876
Can we eat one? 

1565
01:08:19,876 --> 01:08:22,076
- It doesn't matter. / - This one. 

1566
01:08:22,876 --> 01:08:25,376
- There aren't any seats left. / - Yeah. 

1567
01:08:25,842 --> 01:08:27,376
I really want to eat this. 

1568
01:08:27,876 --> 01:08:29,676
But there aren't any seats so we can't go inside. 

1569
01:08:33,009 --> 01:08:34,342
Skewers. 

1570
01:08:35,042 --> 01:08:37,776
- I don't want to eat it right now. / - Me too. 

1571
01:08:38,009 --> 01:08:39,276
Chicken drumsticks. 

1572
01:08:39,276 --> 01:08:40,576
(They have chicken drumsticks here) 

1573
01:08:41,542 --> 01:08:43,076
(She's not interested) 

1574
01:08:43,076 --> 01:08:44,142
It's okay. 

1575
01:08:45,276 --> 01:08:46,542
Since my stomach is empty, 

1576
01:08:46,542 --> 01:08:48,742
I want to eat something hot 

1577
01:08:48,742 --> 01:08:51,676
or something like soup. 

1578
01:08:52,742 --> 01:08:54,209
- Your stomach is empty? / - It's empty? 

1579
01:08:54,209 --> 01:08:55,309
It's empty. 

1580
01:08:55,309 --> 01:08:57,776
- She only has bugs in there. / - She climbed up stairs. 

1581
01:08:58,076 --> 01:08:59,376
Her stomach's empty? 

1582
01:09:03,309 --> 01:09:06,642
(Heeeun looks for rice noodle roll everywhere) 

1583
01:09:08,342 --> 01:09:12,842
(Rice noodle roll, I'm going to find you no matter what) 

1584
01:09:12,842 --> 01:09:14,109
Does this place... 

1585
01:09:15,176 --> 01:09:16,576
Sell sweet red bean porridge? 

1586
01:09:17,342 --> 01:09:19,776
(Wait a minute, that's it) 

1587
01:09:22,609 --> 01:09:23,909
Red bean douhua. 

1588
01:09:24,442 --> 01:09:25,876
This is the same one. 

1589
01:09:26,176 --> 01:09:28,242
It has the same... 

1590
01:09:28,542 --> 01:09:29,576
Picture. 

1591
01:09:31,242 --> 01:09:33,676
That really is a specialty in China. 

1592
01:09:33,676 --> 01:09:35,709
They only have one table. 

1593
01:09:36,276 --> 01:09:38,509
- That other place was indoors. / - You watch him... 

1594
01:09:38,509 --> 01:09:39,709
As he makes it. 

1595
01:09:41,709 --> 01:09:44,609
Thank you. I wanted to eat this. 

1596
01:09:45,876 --> 01:09:49,476
- It's the white stuff at dim sum places, right? / - Yes. 

1597
01:09:57,209 --> 01:09:58,276
Let's try it. 

1598
01:09:58,776 --> 01:10:00,409
The long-awaited taste. 

1599
01:10:04,476 --> 01:10:06,476
(Wide open) 

1600
01:10:07,976 --> 01:10:09,976
(Inhales the food) 

1601
01:10:11,709 --> 01:10:13,809
(Let's gobble it up) 

1602
01:10:14,509 --> 01:10:16,576
There's nothing left. 

1603
01:10:18,242 --> 01:10:20,576
She looks so sad. 

1604
01:10:21,176 --> 01:10:22,509
Her face looks so sad. 

1605
01:10:23,609 --> 01:10:25,676
That's so funny. 

1606
01:10:27,276 --> 01:10:29,542
- I also like this. / - We don't have this in Korea. 

1607
01:10:29,542 --> 01:10:31,676
We have thin rice noodles 

1608
01:10:31,676 --> 01:10:34,809
but we don't have flat noodles like this. 

1609
01:10:35,776 --> 01:10:38,476
It has a really light and clean taste. 

1610
01:10:38,942 --> 01:10:40,709
They don't use a lot of artificial flavors. 

1611
01:10:40,709 --> 01:10:41,909
Yes, that's why it's nice. 

1612
01:10:44,609 --> 01:10:45,676
It's good. 

1613
01:10:51,042 --> 01:10:53,542
- It's really chewy. / - How interesting. 

1614
01:10:53,542 --> 01:10:55,642
- It's thin. / - Rice noodles fall apart. 

1615
01:10:55,642 --> 01:10:57,676
There are vegetables and dried shrimp. 

1616
01:10:58,742 --> 01:11:01,009
Should we also try that red bean douhua? 

1617
01:11:01,776 --> 01:11:04,376
It must be red beans and pudding. 

1618
01:11:05,242 --> 01:11:08,942
(A fresh combination of red beans and silken tofu) 

1619
01:11:09,442 --> 01:11:12,409
(A healthy dessert that is charming because it's mild) 

1620
01:11:12,409 --> 01:11:14,876
(Red bean douhua, $1.60) 

1621
01:11:14,876 --> 01:11:17,676
(Big red beans from tropical climates) 

1622
01:11:19,176 --> 01:11:22,009
(The sisters' eating show) 

1623
01:11:22,009 --> 01:11:25,576
It's silken tofu with red bean boiled down in sugar... 

1624
01:11:25,942 --> 01:11:28,076
Topped on it. 

1625
01:11:28,242 --> 01:11:30,342
- It's not that sweet. / - It's not sweet. 

1626
01:11:30,642 --> 01:11:32,576
It has a very natural taste. 

1627
01:11:32,576 --> 01:11:33,542
It's good. 

1628
01:11:33,542 --> 01:11:34,676
It was good. 

1629
01:11:36,876 --> 01:11:38,709
- It was good. / - Yes, it was good. 

1630
01:11:38,709 --> 01:11:40,076
The price was so cheap. 

1631
01:11:40,076 --> 01:11:42,476
- It's really cheap. / - It's $1.60. 

1632
01:11:45,009 --> 01:11:46,442
I don't think they will be able to leave the night market. 

1633
01:11:46,442 --> 01:11:48,676
- They're eating from each shop. / - Until it closes. 

1634
01:11:48,676 --> 01:11:50,542
I don't think they can leave until they gain 5kg. 

1635
01:11:51,009 --> 01:11:53,076
- You can't get out of there. / - That's right. 

1636
01:11:55,542 --> 01:12:00,642
(The night in Xiamen deepens) 

1637
01:12:04,409 --> 01:12:06,942
(They visit Zhongshan Road again at night) 

1638
01:12:06,942 --> 01:12:09,709
- I really like Xiamen. / - Me too. 

1639
01:12:13,542 --> 01:12:19,476
This is where we had breakfast. 

1640
01:12:19,476 --> 01:12:21,409
We're back on Zhongshan Road. 

1641
01:12:22,276 --> 01:12:25,909
This kind of view was unimaginable in the morning. 

1642
01:12:26,309 --> 01:12:30,809
The night view of Zhongshan Road, especially, 

1643
01:12:30,809 --> 01:12:34,776
is really like Myeong-dong when I was young. 

1644
01:12:35,276 --> 01:12:38,609
- At night, the lights... / - It feels different. 

1645
01:12:38,609 --> 01:12:40,576
Of the signs reflect. 

1646
01:12:40,576 --> 01:12:43,842
The street looks more splendid and gorgeous. 

1647
01:12:43,842 --> 01:12:45,142
(Unexpected Gift Tour looks back on the day) 

1648
01:12:45,142 --> 01:12:48,676
Today was really like an unexpected gift. 

1649
01:12:49,209 --> 01:12:51,809
You don't know how precious it was. 

1650
01:12:51,809 --> 01:12:54,642
- It was very precious. / - You're right. 

1651
01:12:54,642 --> 01:12:57,242
It's been so long since we've been on 

1652
01:12:57,242 --> 01:12:59,909
an overnight trip together. It was so nice. 

1653
01:12:59,909 --> 01:13:01,676
- Today was quite a nice day. / - It was. 

1654
01:13:05,376 --> 01:13:13,076
(The sisters received a gift of memories) 

1655
01:13:15,776 --> 01:13:17,476
Let's promise for the next time. 

1656
01:13:17,476 --> 01:13:20,442
(We hope that we will also be together next time) 

1657
01:13:31,509 --> 01:13:36,476
Sometimes when you watch these trips, 

1658
01:13:36,476 --> 01:13:39,109
you wonder if they tried too to make it fun. 

1659
01:13:39,109 --> 01:13:41,509
But this trip showed you the best of everything. 

1660
01:13:41,509 --> 01:13:43,209
You're right. 

1661
01:13:43,209 --> 01:13:45,009
Nothing seemed forced. 

1662
01:13:45,009 --> 01:13:46,576
It's like that at our age. 

1663
01:13:46,576 --> 01:13:48,576
When you go through everything in life, 

1664
01:13:48,576 --> 01:13:51,776
you don't exaggerate or package things. 

1665
01:13:51,776 --> 01:13:55,276
We just did things we want and it was substantial. 

1666
01:13:55,276 --> 01:13:58,276
- I think the island was so pretty. / - Gulangyu? 

1667
01:13:58,276 --> 01:14:00,042
It was like an island in Southern Italy. 

1668
01:14:00,042 --> 01:14:02,609
- That's right. / - If we have time... 

1669
01:14:02,609 --> 01:14:04,109
We want to walk to Gulangyu from Xiamen 

1670
01:14:04,109 --> 01:14:05,776
and look around the island. 

1671
01:14:05,776 --> 01:14:08,342
- A walking trip would be nice. / - It was really nice. 

1672
01:14:08,642 --> 01:14:11,542
- We really recommend it. / - The park is really big. 

1673
01:14:11,542 --> 01:14:14,142
If you go into the alleys, there are a lot of restaurants. 

1674
01:14:14,142 --> 01:14:17,209
- The houses are really pretty. / - They're pretty. 

1675
01:14:17,209 --> 01:14:18,576
Heeeun, 

1676
01:14:18,576 --> 01:14:20,442
I thought it was so amazing 

1677
01:14:20,442 --> 01:14:23,076
that they had the Piano Museum on the island. 

1678
01:14:23,076 --> 01:14:25,476
- Since you're all musicians. / - Yes. 

1679
01:14:25,476 --> 01:14:27,242
It's known as the cradle for musicians 

1680
01:14:27,242 --> 01:14:30,142
and the island of pianos. 

1681
01:14:30,142 --> 01:14:31,576
Because there are a lot of 

1682
01:14:31,576 --> 01:14:33,942
Chinese musicians from Gulangyu. 

1683
01:14:33,942 --> 01:14:35,209
- Really? / - Yes. 

1684
01:14:35,209 --> 01:14:38,376
I think that parents will really like this place 

1685
01:14:38,376 --> 01:14:40,942
if young people plan this trip... 

1686
01:14:40,942 --> 01:14:42,009
- And recommend it to them. / - Yes. 

1687
01:14:42,009 --> 01:14:44,276
They'll say no but have a great time once they're there. 

1688
01:14:44,276 --> 01:14:45,276
- Of course. / - Of course. 

1689
01:14:45,276 --> 01:14:47,742
- They'll say, "It's too bothersome." / - That's right. 

1690
01:14:48,176 --> 01:14:49,842
But it'll be memorable. 

1691
01:14:49,842 --> 01:14:51,442
- Of course. / - Of course. 

1692
01:14:51,442 --> 01:14:53,409
It's time to find out the expenses. 

1693
01:14:54,809 --> 01:14:56,542
We prepared a special list 

1694
01:14:56,542 --> 01:14:59,342
of the average cost of a holiday in China. 

1695
01:14:59,342 --> 01:15:02,709
We went to several places in China. 

1696
01:15:02,709 --> 01:15:05,942
Park Sohyun and Hong Hyunhee went to Hangzhou. 

1697
01:15:05,942 --> 01:15:07,042
Their final expense was... 

1698
01:15:07,042 --> 01:15:08,176
How much was it for Hangzhou? 

1699
01:15:09,176 --> 01:15:11,509
$289.90. 

1700
01:15:11,509 --> 01:15:13,509
- This is excluding transportation. / - Yes. 

1701
01:15:13,509 --> 01:15:15,976
- Chengdu spent... / - Excluding the airfare... 

1702
01:15:15,976 --> 01:15:18,409
$269. 

1703
01:15:18,676 --> 01:15:22,109
They all spent between $250 and $300 in China. 

1704
01:15:22,109 --> 01:15:24,509
Why did we prepare this? 

1705
01:15:24,742 --> 01:15:27,242
It's not like we'll say, "But we spent $700!" 

1706
01:15:28,309 --> 01:15:29,709
- I'm a little scared. / - Yes. 

1707
01:15:29,709 --> 01:15:31,876
