(Lee Hwijae, special host, Kim Taehoon)

00:00:08,176 --> 00:00:09,376
(Kim Sook, Sung Sikyung)

4
00:00:10,709 --> 00:00:11,943
Travel is war.

5
00:00:11,943 --> 00:00:14,276
Battle Trip!

6
00:00:16,676 --> 00:00:19,376
Today's special host is very reliable.

7
00:00:19,376 --> 00:00:21,676
He's a walking encyclopedia.

8
00:00:21,676 --> 00:00:22,809
It's Kim Taehoon.

9
00:00:22,809 --> 00:00:24,076
- Hello. / - Welcome.

10
00:00:25,976 --> 00:00:28,043
He's standing here

11
00:00:28,043 --> 00:00:29,109
and it doesn't feel strange at all.

12
00:00:29,109 --> 00:00:29,976
- It's really reassuring. / - Right.

13
00:00:29,976 --> 00:00:31,743
It's like he's always been here.

14
00:00:31,743 --> 00:00:35,209
I live my life like it's a journey.

15
00:00:35,209 --> 00:00:37,043
- Here we go. / - Being here today...

16
00:00:37,043 --> 00:00:38,476
- I feel very secure. / - Right.

17
00:00:38,476 --> 00:00:40,543
- And I feel whole. / - Right.

18
00:00:40,543 --> 00:00:43,043
You can ask any question you want.

19
00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:44,976
- He can answer anything. / - That's right.

20
00:00:44,976 --> 00:00:46,876
It means he lies a lot.

21
00:00:46,876 --> 00:00:48,243
But he knows a lot of things.

22
00:00:49,176 --> 00:00:50,576
It's fun to know a lot.

23
00:00:50,576 --> 00:00:53,009
It's been 5 minutes since I've been here. What is this?

24
00:00:54,643 --> 00:00:56,709
Can you tell us about Yeouido?

25
00:00:56,709 --> 00:00:58,276
- First of all... / - About Yeouido.

26
00:00:58,276 --> 00:01:00,243
Yeouido has interesting Chinese characters.

27
00:01:00,243 --> 00:01:02,376
It uses the characters for "your" and "island."

28
00:01:02,376 --> 00:01:04,009
So it means "your island."

29
00:01:04,009 --> 00:01:05,376
- It's romantic... / - It's like a lecture.

30
00:01:05,376 --> 00:01:07,976
Yeouido has a special significance in Korean society.

31
00:01:07,976 --> 00:01:10,576
It's a cultural space with broadcasting stations.

32
00:01:10,576 --> 00:01:12,109
It's also a major economic center with

33
00:01:12,109 --> 00:01:13,276
many securities companies.

34
00:01:13,276 --> 00:01:16,409
It's like the Wall Street of Korea.

35
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:18,943
It's also a place where you can enjoy cultural festivals

36
00:01:18,943 --> 00:01:20,643
like cherry blossom festivals when

37
00:01:20,643 --> 00:01:22,109
the warm weather comes on.

38
00:01:22,109 --> 00:01:24,209
Where should we go after work?

39
00:01:24,209 --> 00:01:27,043
There's a good whelk restaurant in the back alley.

40
00:01:27,776 --> 00:01:28,943
- It stays open late. / - That's true.

41
00:01:28,943 --> 00:01:30,543
- It's really there. / - It is.

42
00:01:30,543 --> 00:01:32,176
Shin Dongyeob is sometimes there.

43
00:01:33,276 --> 00:01:35,709
I feel reassured that he's on my team today.

44
00:01:36,443 --> 00:01:38,009
So where are we going today?

45
00:01:38,009 --> 00:01:39,076
Let's meet our client first.

46
00:01:39,076 --> 00:01:39,776
- Let's meet today's client. / - Okay.

47
00:01:39,776 --> 00:01:40,609
Let's meet him.

48
00:01:41,109 --> 00:01:42,709
Hello, I'm Kim Junseok.

49
00:01:42,709 --> 00:01:44,776
I'm 36 years old and I live in Seoul.

50
00:01:44,776 --> 00:01:46,576
I'm planning a trip to the U.K.

51
00:01:46,576 --> 00:01:48,609
There are many beautiful cities

52
00:01:48,609 --> 00:01:51,009
in the U.K. besides London.

53
00:01:51,009 --> 00:01:52,776
Instead of the obvious stops,

54
00:01:52,776 --> 00:01:54,443
I'd like a really unique city trip.

55
00:01:54,443 --> 00:01:56,176
Please design one for me, Battle Trip.

56
00:01:58,376 --> 00:01:59,109
This is difficult.

57
00:01:59,109 --> 00:02:00,776
- The U.K. / - Wait a minute.

58
00:02:00,776 --> 00:02:01,909
With the U.K...

59
00:02:01,909 --> 00:02:03,709
- Kim Kibang and Lee Kyuhan... / - They went there.

60
00:02:03,709 --> 00:02:05,643
That's right, they've been there.

61
00:02:05,643 --> 00:02:07,443
But London isn't the only city in the U.K.

62
00:02:07,443 --> 00:02:09,343
Where would you go in the U.K.?

63
00:02:09,343 --> 00:02:10,676
I'd like to go to Hogwarts.

64
00:02:10,676 --> 00:02:12,509
- What? / - The school of magic...

65
00:02:12,509 --> 00:02:13,509
- What? / - I'd visit Oxford.

66
00:02:13,509 --> 00:02:14,376
Oxford.

67
00:02:14,376 --> 00:02:15,043
Oxford for me.

68
00:02:15,043 --> 00:02:16,443
I'd go to Tottenham.

69
00:02:16,443 --> 00:02:17,243
- Tottenham? / - Tottenham.

70
00:02:17,243 --> 00:02:19,176
Because Son Heungmin is there.

71
00:02:19,176 --> 00:02:20,409
Ireland for me.

72
00:02:20,409 --> 00:02:21,309
I really want to go there.

73
00:02:21,309 --> 00:02:21,876
- Ireland. / - Why?

74
00:02:21,876 --> 00:02:23,576
It's the home of pop music.

75
00:02:23,576 --> 00:02:25,809
- Right. / - Say something as the pop columnist.

76
00:02:25,809 --> 00:02:27,609
Since the 1960s, following The Beatles...

77
00:02:27,609 --> 00:02:30,576
It's been the Mecca of pop music.

78
00:02:30,576 --> 00:02:32,943
It's the home of musicians

79
00:02:32,943 --> 00:02:35,476
who have inspired countless artists worldwide.

80
00:02:35,476 --> 00:02:37,643
We can't talk about music without mentioning the U.K.

81
00:02:38,343 --> 00:02:39,509
The weather

82
00:02:39,509 --> 00:02:41,243
isn't so good there though, right?

83
00:02:41,243 --> 00:02:44,576
In fact, the gloomy weather

84
00:02:44,576 --> 00:02:45,909
inspired many musicians...

85
00:02:45,909 --> 00:02:47,809
- Of the U.K. / - That's right.

86
00:02:47,809 --> 00:02:48,676
People say that.

87
00:02:48,676 --> 00:02:50,543
That's why many artists

88
00:02:50,543 --> 00:02:52,243
love the U.K.

89
00:02:52,243 --> 00:02:54,876
In that sense, I think it is a charming nation.

90
00:02:54,876 --> 00:02:57,443
For today's episode,

91
00:02:57,443 --> 00:02:59,409
we have four very special guests.

92
00:02:59,409 --> 00:03:01,309
Our trip designers, please come on out.

93
00:03:01,309 --> 00:03:02,409
Welcome.

94
00:03:04,709 --> 00:03:06,376
(Lee Gikwang, Yoon Dujun of Highlight)

95
00:03:07,576 --> 00:03:09,276
(Lee Jonghyuk, Lim Hyungjun)

96
00:03:12,843 --> 00:03:14,409
- Welcome. / - It really is a special.

97
00:03:14,409 --> 00:03:16,643
We have very special

98
00:03:16,643 --> 00:03:18,043
trip designers today.

99
00:03:18,043 --> 00:03:20,076
They are experts on this show.

100
00:03:20,076 --> 00:03:22,143
Lim Hyungjun and Yoon Dujun.

101
00:03:22,143 --> 00:03:23,709
They have both won the battle twice.

102
00:03:23,709 --> 00:03:25,243
They have two wins.

103
00:03:25,243 --> 00:03:26,209
- That means... / - So...

104
00:03:26,209 --> 00:03:27,509
- This year... / - No losses, right?

105
00:03:27,509 --> 00:03:29,709
I was on the very first episode. Founding contributor.

106
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:30,776
You are a founding contributor.

107
00:03:30,776 --> 00:03:32,209
- I was here with Seol Minseok. / - Founding.

108
00:03:32,209 --> 00:03:35,243
- That's right. / - They won by a landslide then.

109
00:03:35,243 --> 00:03:38,043
- We won by a big margin. / - It was incredible.

110
00:03:38,043 --> 00:03:38,609
And?

111
00:03:38,609 --> 00:03:40,976
From what I have heard, this program...

112
00:03:40,976 --> 00:03:44,243
That Thailand trip with Kim Minkyo...

113
00:03:45,109 --> 00:03:45,843
That caused a boom?

114
00:03:45,843 --> 00:03:47,243
- Yes. That's what I heard. / - It caused a boom.

115
00:03:47,243 --> 00:03:48,976
It kept this show going, so to speak.

116
00:03:49,609 --> 00:03:50,743
It kept this show going, so to speak.

117
00:03:51,609 --> 00:03:52,743
Revived a dying show.

118
00:03:52,743 --> 00:03:54,076
That's true to some extent.

119
00:03:54,076 --> 00:03:55,476
- Right? I heard it had great ratings. / - That's right.

120
00:03:55,476 --> 00:03:57,976
- It had great ratings. / - It did provide a boost.

121
00:03:57,976 --> 00:03:59,143
We acknowledge that.

122
00:03:59,143 --> 00:04:00,009
What I'm curious about is...

123
00:04:00,009 --> 00:04:02,076
You must've visited two cities

124
00:04:02,076 --> 00:04:03,909
excluding London.

125
00:04:03,909 --> 00:04:05,709
Could you introduce your cities first?

126
00:04:05,709 --> 00:04:07,643
Yes, we visited...

127
00:04:07,643 --> 00:04:10,076
The U.K.'s heart of soccer.

128
00:04:10,076 --> 00:04:11,909
We visited Manchester.

129
00:04:11,909 --> 00:04:13,976
Hwijae must be so happy.

130
00:04:14,876 --> 00:04:15,876
Manchester!

131
00:04:15,876 --> 00:04:17,576
- The city he wants to really visit. / - Manchester!

132
00:04:17,576 --> 00:04:20,143
- Wow. / - The connection between soccer and...

133
00:04:20,143 --> 00:04:21,809
Manchester is extremely difficult to beat.

134
00:04:22,809 --> 00:04:24,076
It's very difficult to beat.

135
00:04:24,076 --> 00:04:26,443
Which city did you two visit?

136
00:04:26,443 --> 00:04:27,243
- Us? / - Yes.

137
00:04:27,243 --> 00:04:28,943
- We went to a nice city too. / - Where did you go?

138
00:04:28,943 --> 00:04:29,709
- Where? / - A nice city?

139
00:04:29,709 --> 00:04:31,643
- He says a nice city. / - A nice city.

140
00:04:31,643 --> 00:04:32,809
We have to win.

141
00:04:32,809 --> 00:04:34,609
If Manchester

142
00:04:34,609 --> 00:04:36,643
is the heart of soccer,

143
00:04:36,643 --> 00:04:38,209
ours is the liver.

144
00:04:38,209 --> 00:04:39,143
The liver?

145
00:04:39,143 --> 00:04:41,943
The liver is extremely important.

146
00:04:41,943 --> 00:04:43,276
- It is. / - All the guys know, right?

147
00:04:43,276 --> 00:04:44,276
- How important the liver is? / - Of course.

148
00:04:44,276 --> 00:04:46,009
- The heart is more important. / - Liver.

149
00:04:46,009 --> 00:04:47,076
Where is the liver of soccer?

150
00:04:47,076 --> 00:04:49,976
It's the heart of the music scene, Liverpool.

151
00:04:52,709 --> 00:04:53,843
It's the city of The Beatles.

152
00:04:53,843 --> 00:04:54,776
Actually,

153
00:04:54,776 --> 00:04:56,176
these two teams are rivals.

154
00:04:56,176 --> 00:04:57,843
- Liverpool vs. Manchester... / - That's right.

155
00:04:57,843 --> 00:05:00,043
When these two teams go at it, it's the red derby.

156
00:05:00,043 --> 00:05:02,809
- Both teams wear red uniforms. / - Both wear red.

157
00:05:02,809 --> 00:05:05,776
Liverpool vs. Manchester is like Korea vs. Japan.

158
00:05:05,776 --> 00:05:07,976
- Is that so? / - It's a must-win match.

159
00:05:07,976 --> 00:05:09,509
Music vs. soccer.

160
00:05:09,509 --> 00:05:11,143
Hwijae, music or soccer?

161
00:05:11,143 --> 00:05:13,109
- Huh? / - Music or soccer?

162
00:05:13,109 --> 00:05:14,409
- Of course it's music. / - Why must I choose?

163
00:05:14,409 --> 00:05:15,443
Why am I music?

164
00:05:15,443 --> 00:05:17,243
- You were a singer. / - You released an album.

165
00:05:17,243 --> 00:05:18,276
You sang "Say Goodbye."

166
00:05:18,276 --> 00:05:19,409
- "Blessing You." / - You're a former singer.

167
00:05:19,409 --> 00:05:21,043
- You were a singer. / - "Say Goodbye."

168
00:05:21,043 --> 00:05:23,709
How could you compare my album to Liverpool?

169
00:05:23,709 --> 00:05:24,909
- No way. / - But you love music.

170
00:05:24,909 --> 00:05:26,709
It's The Beatles... No way.

171
00:05:26,709 --> 00:05:27,709
I apologize.

172
00:05:27,709 --> 00:05:29,743
I think our trip will be about The Beatles.

173
00:05:29,743 --> 00:05:31,376
Did you see any matches in Manchester?

174
00:05:31,376 --> 00:05:32,743
- Us? / - That's the important part.

175
00:05:32,743 --> 00:05:33,976
- I bet you watched it at a pub. / - We did.

176
00:05:35,509 --> 00:05:38,276
We watched Manchester United vs. Manchester City.

177
00:05:38,276 --> 00:05:40,076
- A derby match. / - A derby match.

178
00:05:40,076 --> 00:05:40,709
A big match.

179
00:05:40,709 --> 00:05:41,976
- The Manchester derby? / - Yes.

180
00:05:43,143 --> 00:05:44,976
Since they watched the match...

181
00:05:44,976 --> 00:05:46,376
I feel slightly worried.

182
00:05:46,376 --> 00:05:48,209
No, no. It's the contrary.

183
00:05:48,209 --> 00:05:49,276
I'm already bored.

184
00:05:51,843 --> 00:05:53,976
- But you like soccer. / - We understand.

185
00:05:53,976 --> 00:05:55,576
You like tennis!

186
00:05:55,576 --> 00:05:57,076
It's only fun for them.

187
00:05:57,076 --> 00:05:58,409
They just watched soccer for themselves.

188
00:05:58,409 --> 00:06:00,343
People only think of Manchester United

189
00:06:00,343 --> 00:06:03,209
when it comes to Manchester.

190
00:06:03,209 --> 00:06:04,143
- That's true. / - With Liverpool...

191
00:06:04,143 --> 00:06:05,243
They only think of soccer.

192
00:06:05,243 --> 00:06:06,209
Don't we want to

193
00:06:06,209 --> 00:06:08,309
go there and see what the city is really like?

194
00:06:08,309 --> 00:06:09,443
Let's look at the map

195
00:06:09,443 --> 00:06:11,676
and see where each city is located.

196
00:06:11,676 --> 00:06:13,043
- Okay. / - Where are they?

197
00:06:13,043 --> 00:06:13,709
It's far.

198
00:06:13,709 --> 00:06:15,743
Goodness, it's so far.

199
00:06:15,743 --> 00:06:17,976
London is beneath there.

200
00:06:17,976 --> 00:06:19,543
- What a shame. / - So that's where they are.

201
00:06:19,543 --> 00:06:21,509
- They're close. / - Right next to each other.

202
00:06:21,509 --> 00:06:23,576
It must've taken about the same time to get there.

203
00:06:23,576 --> 00:06:25,543
Around 2.5 hours by train.

204
00:06:25,543 --> 00:06:27,009
Same for us. 2.5 hours.

205
00:06:27,009 --> 00:06:28,643
- The same. / - It's the same.

206
00:06:28,643 --> 00:06:29,876
2.5 hours by train.

207
00:06:29,876 --> 00:06:31,509
You might as well visit Liverpool and then

208
00:06:31,509 --> 00:06:32,976
drop by Manchester while you're there.

209
00:06:32,976 --> 00:06:33,809
Since they're close by.

210
00:06:33,809 --> 00:06:34,509
- You could do that. / - That's good too.

211
00:06:34,509 --> 00:06:36,876
- Right? / - Anyway for today...

212
00:06:36,876 --> 00:06:39,943
We have our 100 judges who will vote on today's trips.

213
00:06:39,943 --> 00:06:42,209
- Nice to meet you. / - Welcome.

214
00:06:43,243 --> 00:06:46,276
Each trip will have a first half and second half.

215
00:06:46,276 --> 00:06:47,676
They'll be shown in two halves.

216
00:06:48,376 --> 00:06:51,609
- You have to vote 4 times. / - Right.

217
00:06:51,609 --> 00:06:53,309
It's not a total vote.

218
00:06:53,309 --> 00:06:56,443
Only the final vote will determine the winner.

219
00:06:56,443 --> 00:06:57,643
Okay then.

220
00:06:57,643 --> 00:06:58,843
Should we start with our team?

221
00:06:58,843 --> 00:06:59,909
Go to Manchester first?

222
00:06:59,909 --> 00:07:00,909
- Yes. / - Your team name?

223
00:07:00,909 --> 00:07:02,876
To tell you about our team name...

224
00:07:02,876 --> 00:07:04,543
To tell you what it is...

225
00:07:04,543 --> 00:07:06,476
- We took the High from Highlight. / - High.

226
00:07:06,476 --> 00:07:08,576
And the Man from Manchester.

227
00:07:08,576 --> 00:07:09,476
2, 3.

228
00:07:09,476 --> 00:07:11,176
HighMan Tour!

229
00:07:11,176 --> 00:07:12,243
Oh, what a fail.

230
00:07:15,676 --> 00:07:17,109
- Hello. / - Hello.

231
00:07:17,109 --> 00:07:17,809
- Hello. / - Hello.

232
00:07:17,809 --> 00:07:20,409
- Hello. / - I'm Yoon Dujun of Highlight.

233
00:07:20,409 --> 00:07:21,543
I'm Lee Gikwang.

234

- That's right. / - Nice to meet you.

235

237
00:07:34,109 --> 00:07:35,343

00:07:37,909 --> 00:07:43,909
(Idols who are known as hardcore soccer fans)

239
00:07:44,443 --> 00:07:45,309
From what I hear...

240
00:07:45,309 --> 00:07:47,609
- This is your third time already. / - That's right.

241
00:07:47,609 --> 00:07:50,476
This is Lim Hyungjun's third time too.

242
00:07:50,476 --> 00:07:52,309
He has won all of his battles too.

243
00:07:52,309 --> 00:07:53,643
- I won all my battles too. / - Really?

244
00:07:53,643 --> 00:07:54,743
This is a death match.

245
00:07:54,743 --> 00:07:56,943
The losing team can't star on Battle Trip after this.

246
00:07:59,509 --> 00:08:01,476
I can see Dujun is getting competitive.

247
00:08:01,476 --> 00:08:02,776
I think we should visit

248
00:08:02,776 --> 00:08:05,076
the birthplace of soccer.

249
00:08:05,076 --> 00:08:07,843
How about we visit Manchester.

250

- Park Jisung goals! / - I miss that.

253
00:08:12,276 --> 00:08:14,009
- Park Jisung... / - It'll destroy my mind.

254
00:08:14,009 --> 00:08:16,376
My mind is already destroyed.

255
00:08:17,343 --> 00:08:18,576
They're good at soccer.

256
00:08:18,576 --> 00:08:20,143
Lee Gikwang flies down the field.

257
00:08:20,143 --> 00:08:21,643

00:08:28,443 --> 00:08:30,076
(From playing soccer to watching the match)

261
00:08:30,076 --> 00:08:31,076
(A to Z about soccer!)

262
00:08:31,676 --> 00:08:33,309
(You thought it was over, right?)

263
00:08:33,309 --> 00:08:34,209
Amazing.

264

265
00:08:37,343 --> 00:08:38,576
Wow. What is that?

266

This is amazing.

267
00:08:41,376 --> 00:08:42,576
Unbelievable.

268
00:08:44,876 --> 00:08:46,709
That looks like fun.

269
00:08:47,176 --> 00:08:48,876
It's a soccer tour.

270
00:08:48,876 --> 00:08:51,409
But soccer in some ways...

271
00:08:51,409 --> 00:08:52,543
You can love it or hate it.

272
00:08:52,543 --> 00:08:54,009
- There's a division. / - That's right.

273
00:08:54,009 --> 00:08:56,176
We'll divide the trip into two sections.

274
00:08:56,176 --> 00:08:58,943
One day, we'll fill with activities

275
00:08:58,943 --> 00:09:01,709
that suit a holiday trip.

276
00:09:01,709 --> 00:09:02,643
And the rest will be soccer.

277
00:09:02,643 --> 00:09:04,909
They should've gone all in with soccer.

278
00:09:05,609 --> 00:09:07,243
- Then we would've won. / - Right.

279

- That's right. / - You must feel unfamiliar.

292
00:09:31,643 --> 00:09:32,576
Very unfamiliar.

293
00:09:32,576 --> 00:09:33,909
It will be.

294
00:09:33,909 --> 00:09:34,809
Actually...

295
00:09:34,809 --> 00:09:37,776
- You look more afraid than excited. / - Right.

296
00:09:37,776 --> 00:09:38,943
Don't worry about it.

297
00:09:38,943 --> 00:09:39,976

Go!

00:09:52,509 --> 00:09:54,709
It's so strange to hold this camera.

304
00:09:55,443 --> 00:09:56,376
It would be.

305
00:09:57,109 --> 00:09:59,276

They're taking off now.

311
00:10:15,476 --> 00:10:17,109
What's the highlight of taking flights?

312
00:10:17,109 --> 00:10:18,509
It's the in-flight meal.

313
00:10:18,509 --> 00:10:21,676
Here's your in-flight meal.

314
00:10:21,676 --> 00:10:23,443
(Dujun likes Korean food so goes with bibimbap)

(Gikwang is on diet so goes with the salad)

316

Enjoy.

323
00:10:46,676 --> 00:10:50,076
I thought Manchester was a rural area but it's not.

324
00:10:50,676 --> 00:10:51,509
It's the second largest city.

325

They call it the underground.

337
00:11:23,276 --> 00:11:24,576
They also call it the tube.

338
00:11:25,476 --> 00:11:27,409
- Tube or underground. / - Tube or underground.

339
00:11:29,476 --> 00:11:31,009

Hi.

345
00:11:40,676 --> 00:11:44,076
This is thanks to K-POP.

346
00:11:44,076 --> 00:11:47,776
- Thanks to BTS. / - Our BTS friends.

347
00:11:56,109 --> 00:11:58,009

Yes, we are in London now.

That must be a shopping street.

356
00:12:13,509 --> 00:12:14,809
I think that's probably a department store.

and it feels so good.

362
00:12:30,643 --> 00:12:31,976
Look at the double-decker bus.

363
00:12:31,976 --> 00:12:33,343
Wow, double-decker bus.

364
00:12:33,343 --> 00:12:36,243
I would think the bus would tip over.

365
00:12:36,243 --> 00:12:37,309
That's really high.

366
00:12:37,309 --> 00:12:38,509
That's the symbol of London.

367
00:12:38,509 --> 00:12:41,109
That's so beautiful.

368
00:12:42,209 --> 00:12:43,509
The thing is...

369
00:12:43,509 --> 00:12:45,909
Europe has a sense of romanticism in the winter.

370
00:12:45,909 --> 00:12:47,443
Yeah, there's something romantic about the cold.

371
00:12:47,443 --> 00:12:49,376
It's cold but still beautiful.

372
00:12:49,376 --> 00:12:52,109
How did they make this look so good.

373
00:12:52,609 --> 00:12:53,809
- It feels like... / - Regent Street.

374
00:12:53,809 --> 00:12:55,409
It doesn't feel like we're shooting.

375
00:12:55,409 --> 00:12:56,743
I feel like I'm on a real trip.

376
00:13:01,209 --> 00:13:04,009
(It's time to depart for Manchester)

377
00:13:04,476 --> 00:13:06,809
(Euston Station)

378
00:13:06,809 --> 00:13:08,643
Finally.

379
00:13:08,643 --> 00:13:10,176
- We are... / - Yes.

380
00:13:10,176 --> 00:13:11,376
About to leave for Manchester.

381
00:13:11,376 --> 00:13:12,209
To Manchester.

382
00:13:12,209 --> 00:13:14,009
But we just arrived in London.

383
00:13:14,009 --> 00:13:16,309
The name of our tour is HighMan.

384
00:13:16,309 --> 00:13:17,809
- Yes, Highlight. / - It's not HighLon.

385
00:13:17,809 --> 00:13:19,809
- Right. / - We'll head to Manchester.

386
00:13:19,809 --> 00:13:21,843
- Are you going straight there? / - How will we go?

387
00:13:21,843 --> 00:13:23,776
We can take the high-speed train.

388
00:13:23,776 --> 00:13:26,509
The distance between is about 300 to 400km.

389
00:13:26,509 --> 00:13:28,443
It's about the same as Seoul to Busan.

390
00:13:28,443 --> 00:13:32,309
It takes about 2 and 30 minutes by train.

391
00:13:32,309 --> 00:13:34,609
- 330km is actually Seoul to Busan. / - Let's go.

392
00:13:35,476 --> 00:13:37,943
I think they probably used Virgin Trains.

393
00:13:37,943 --> 00:13:40,843
From memory, the tickets aren't that cheap.

394
00:13:40,843 --> 00:13:42,076
Transportation does cost a bit.

395
00:13:42,076 --> 00:13:43,876
- Transportation in Europe. / - It's expensive.

396
00:13:45,709 --> 00:13:47,409
It's nice and cozy.

397
00:13:47,409 --> 00:13:49,243
It's nice and warm.

398
00:13:50,543 --> 00:13:53,876
When else would I ride the KTX in England...

399
00:13:53,876 --> 00:13:56,009
- At the age of 29? / - That's right.

400
00:13:56,609 --> 00:13:57,343
This is nice.

401
00:13:58,609 --> 00:13:59,543
Even though it's dark.

402
00:13:59,543 --> 00:14:01,476
It'd be nice to ride this during the day.

403
00:14:09,609 --> 00:14:13,343
(They can't see anything as it's pitch-dark outside)

404
00:14:14,109 --> 00:14:17,443
(This is the view they would've seen in the afternoon)

405
00:14:20,009 --> 00:14:26,209
(The train ride to Manchester on a snowy day)

406
00:14:27,143 --> 00:14:28,009
(That's beautiful)

407
00:14:28,009 --> 00:14:30,609
Let's travel for 2.5 hours on this train.

408
00:14:30,609 --> 00:14:33,009
I want someone to hit me, so I can pass out.

409
00:14:35,843 --> 00:14:40,209
(Dujun and Gikwang fall fast asleep)

410
00:14:40,209 --> 00:14:41,276
The time difference...

411
00:14:41,276 --> 00:14:42,543
- I was so tired. / - The jetlag got to us.

412
00:14:42,543 --> 00:14:45,243
Europe has the time difference that's most difficult...

413
00:14:45,243 --> 00:14:46,409
- To overcome. / - You're right.

414
00:14:46,743 --> 00:14:48,343
(They still look handsome in their sleep)

415
00:14:51,143 --> 00:14:54,909
(The first night of their journey in England passes)

416
00:14:55,643 --> 00:14:59,543
(Manchester)

417
00:14:59,543 --> 00:15:02,243
(What is their first itinerary in Manchester?)

418
00:15:02,243 --> 00:15:03,509
(HighMan Action Tour)

419
00:15:03,509 --> 00:15:07,476
(Museum of Science and Industry)

420
00:15:10,309 --> 00:15:11,309
We are finally...

421
00:15:11,309 --> 00:15:14,043
- Here in Manchester. / - That's right.

422
00:15:14,043 --> 00:15:16,076
- Today is the action day. / - Action Day.

423
00:15:16,076 --> 00:15:17,076
Action.

424
00:15:17,076 --> 00:15:18,609
What do you think of when you think of action?

425
00:15:18,609 --> 00:15:19,809
When it comes to action...

426
00:15:19,809 --> 00:15:21,843
I think of action films.

427
00:15:21,843 --> 00:15:23,209
- Like "Kingsman." / - Right.

428
00:15:23,209 --> 00:15:24,743
When I think of action,

429
00:15:24,743 --> 00:15:26,109
I think of energy,

430
00:15:26,109 --> 00:15:27,209
that's what comes to mind.

431
00:15:27,209 --> 00:15:28,643
This is Manchester, right?

432
00:15:28,643 --> 00:15:31,609
Our Park Jisung of Manchester United.

433
00:15:31,609 --> 00:15:33,843
The oxygen tank of Manchester.

434
00:15:33,843 --> 00:15:35,176
- The oxygen tank. / - Energy.

435
00:15:35,176 --> 00:15:36,943
- Having two hearts. / - Right. Two hearts.

436
00:15:36,943 --> 00:15:38,609
What are they trying to say?

437
00:15:38,609 --> 00:15:39,609
What's going on?

438
00:15:39,609 --> 00:15:40,676
Right. Two hearts.

439
00:15:40,676 --> 00:15:42,009
- The heart is the engine. / - Engine.

440
00:15:42,009 --> 00:15:43,476
Engines are Museum of Science and Industry!

441
00:15:43,476 --> 00:15:45,476
That is where we've invited you.

442
00:15:46,743 --> 00:15:47,476
Great job!

443
00:15:47,476 --> 00:15:50,609
- I knew it. The intro was long. / - Dujun is amazing!

444
00:15:51,276 --> 00:15:52,509
Manchester is

445
00:15:52,509 --> 00:15:55,509
the city where Industrial Revolution kicked off.

446
00:15:55,509 --> 00:15:57,976
I heard there are a lot of great museums

447
00:15:57,976 --> 00:15:59,376
so I thought...

448
00:15:59,376 --> 00:16:00,976
- Sounds good. / - We could visit there.

449
00:16:00,976 --> 00:16:02,709
- We can... / - Yes, good, good.

450
00:16:02,709 --> 00:16:04,109
We could study...

451
00:16:04,109 --> 00:16:06,509
- Fill our heads with knowledge. / - Of course.

452
00:16:06,509 --> 00:16:08,909
Yoon Dujun must've studied a lot.

453
00:16:08,909 --> 00:16:10,743
Yes, he knew a lot.

454
00:16:10,743 --> 00:16:11,876
I only studied lightly.

455
00:16:13,609 --> 00:16:15,543
(Museum of Science and Industry)

456
00:16:15,543 --> 00:16:20,443
(A museum consisting of 5 exhibitions)

457
00:16:20,443 --> 00:16:23,743
(Built on railway and have experience facilities)

458
00:16:23,743 --> 00:16:26,443
The museum has about 5 exhibitions.

459
00:16:26,443 --> 00:16:27,609
- That's big. / - It's really big.

460
00:16:27,609 --> 00:16:29,009
- It's free? / - There's no entrance fee?

461
00:16:29,009 --> 00:16:30,676
- Yes. / - Why is it free?

462
00:16:30,676 --> 00:16:33,343
It showcases England's national power and...

463
00:16:33,343 --> 00:16:35,009
- Scientific technology. / - That's right.

464
00:16:35,009 --> 00:16:37,576
It's a way to show the foreigners their achievements.

465
00:16:37,576 --> 00:16:40,309
- That's why it's for free. / - There's so much to see.

466
00:16:40,309 --> 00:16:41,343
If you look here...

467
00:16:41,343 --> 00:16:43,176
- Air and Space Hall. / - Air and Space Hall.

468
00:16:43,176 --> 00:16:44,743
It's truly energy...

469
00:16:46,176 --> 00:16:46,776
What is that?

470
00:16:47,576 --> 00:16:48,909
This is huge.

471
00:16:49,876 --> 00:16:51,309
(Ta-da)

472
00:16:53,376 --> 00:16:57,809
(All sorts of planes fill the space up)

473
00:16:57,809 --> 00:16:59,509
I really want to visit that museum.

474
00:16:59,509 --> 00:17:00,843
Wright Brothers.

475
00:17:00,843 --> 00:17:02,076
The Wright Brothers made this.

476
00:17:04,176 --> 00:17:04,909
First...

477
00:17:06,176 --> 00:17:07,343
First flight.

478
00:17:07,343 --> 00:17:08,909
Wow, seriously?

479
00:17:09,943 --> 00:17:10,743
This is it.

480
00:17:11,609 --> 00:17:14,109
The way he's carrying that camera...

481
00:17:14,109 --> 00:17:17,176
Dujun loves looking at exhibits.

482
00:17:17,976 --> 00:17:20,309
- It's a suicide plane. / - Yeah, a suicide plane.

483
00:17:20,309 --> 00:17:21,309
In the cockpit.

484
00:17:23,076 --> 00:17:24,443
Where is the other propeller?

485
00:17:25,643 --> 00:17:26,576
Is it in the back?

486
00:17:26,576 --> 00:17:28,209
- Is it on the tail? / - Just one engine?

487
00:17:28,209 --> 00:17:29,343
Light airplane.

488
00:17:30,876 --> 00:17:32,709
That one... Wright Brothers.

489
00:17:32,709 --> 00:17:33,676
We can press it.

490
00:17:35,143 --> 00:17:35,976
We can press it.

491
00:17:38,443 --> 00:17:40,609
- That looks fun too. / - What is that?

492
00:17:40,609 --> 00:17:42,476
- What is this? / - Isn't that a gaming device?

493
00:17:42,476 --> 00:17:44,609
There's an experience space as well.

494
00:17:44,609 --> 00:17:46,376
What is that? You can experience it.

495
00:17:46,376 --> 00:17:47,809
Yeah.

496
00:17:47,809 --> 00:17:49,309
Fly 360 degrees?

497
00:17:49,309 --> 00:17:50,309
- Oh, this. / - Isn't that it?

498
00:17:50,309 --> 00:17:51,709
This is modern VR.

499
00:17:51,709 --> 00:17:53,076
VR is fun.

500
00:17:53,076 --> 00:17:54,976
We become a true pilot.

501
00:17:54,976 --> 00:17:56,009
- There's wind too. / - Yeah.

502
00:17:56,009 --> 00:17:57,443
We get to fly a plane.

503
00:17:57,443 --> 00:18:00,876
It's a 360 degree flight simulator.

504
00:18:00,876 --> 00:18:01,776
Should we try this then?

505
00:18:01,776 --> 00:18:02,576
Let's go then.

506
00:18:02,576 --> 00:18:04,509
- Seriously. / - I can't wait.

507
00:18:04,509 --> 00:18:05,409
Let's try it out.

508
00:18:05,409 --> 00:18:06,243
- Go. / - Let's go.

509
00:18:06,243 --> 00:18:08,243
Have a good trip.

510
00:18:10,709 --> 00:18:12,509
Have a good trip.

511
00:18:16,609 --> 00:18:17,776
What is this?

512
00:18:17,776 --> 00:18:19,809
It's VR but they're not wearing a headset.

513
00:18:19,809 --> 00:18:21,709
There's a screen inside.

514
00:18:21,709 --> 00:18:24,309
- A whole screen? / - That's from the outside.

515
00:18:26,376 --> 00:18:27,576
We get scared easily.

516
00:18:27,576 --> 00:18:28,576
What if we get sick?

517
00:18:29,776 --> 00:18:31,609
If you look outside...

518
00:18:33,709 --> 00:18:35,909
- You can control it yourself? / - Yes, yes.

519
00:18:35,909 --> 00:18:36,943
Who's that? Who's that?

520
00:18:36,943 --> 00:18:37,709
Pull the stick.

521
00:18:38,809 --> 00:18:42,143
(He's moving the stick)

522
00:18:43,576 --> 00:18:46,743
(Wobbling)

523
00:18:47,909 --> 00:18:50,643
(The machine moves too)

524
00:18:50,643 --> 00:18:51,676
Turn it.

525
00:18:53,309 --> 00:18:54,343
Hey, what's going on?

526
00:18:55,909 --> 00:18:56,976
Wait a minute.

527
00:19:00,343 --> 00:19:02,709
Dujun's eyes look so funny.

528
00:19:04,609 --> 00:19:05,476
Hey, wait a minute.

529
00:19:06,243 --> 00:19:07,009
What is this?

530
00:19:07,776 --> 00:19:08,576
What's this?

531
00:19:08,576 --> 00:19:09,976
- Here we go. / - Pull up.

532
00:19:11,376 --> 00:19:12,476
What is this?

533
00:19:13,843 --> 00:19:14,809
Wait a minute.

534
00:19:16,476 --> 00:19:17,443
Wait a minute.

535
00:19:18,209 --> 00:19:20,109
- That safety device... / - This is how they edit it?

536
00:19:20,109 --> 00:19:21,776
- You must wear a safety belt. / - The editing...

537
00:19:21,776 --> 00:19:23,243
It actually spins like that.

538
00:19:23,243 --> 00:19:24,176
It spins.

539
00:19:25,109 --> 00:19:27,543
It's not like the flying games

540
00:19:27,543 --> 00:19:28,709
you play at an arcade.

541
00:19:28,709 --> 00:19:29,809
You're right.

542
00:19:29,809 --> 00:19:30,776
Oh, hey, hey, hey!

543
00:19:31,843 --> 00:19:32,643
Wait a minute.

544
00:19:34,476 --> 00:19:35,843
Hey, hey!

545
00:19:35,843 --> 00:19:38,309
- Blood's rushing to my head. / - Wait a minute.

546
00:19:40,776 --> 00:19:43,076
Wait a minute.

547
00:19:43,076 --> 00:19:44,276
- Blood's rushing. / - So suddenly...

548
00:19:46,276 --> 00:19:48,843
(Focused)

549
00:19:48,843 --> 00:19:50,643
- Right? / - That's why it's 360 degrees.

550
00:19:50,643 --> 00:19:52,009
You're right.

551
00:19:52,376 --> 00:19:53,609
Here we go. Here we go.

552
00:19:54,976 --> 00:19:55,609
Here we go.

553
00:19:55,609 --> 00:19:56,543
Oh, my goodness!

554
00:19:56,543 --> 00:19:58,276
Hey, hey, hey! Don't do that.

555
00:20:01,309 --> 00:20:02,509
Wait a second.

556
00:20:06,609 --> 00:20:08,243
- That looks fun. / - It's different from regular games.

557
00:20:09,476 --> 00:20:10,576
What? It's over.

558
00:20:10,576 --> 00:20:11,376
It's over.

559
00:20:13,709 --> 00:20:14,843
That was a fun time.

560
00:20:14,843 --> 00:20:17,109
It's not that much but it really looks fun.

561
00:20:20,276 --> 00:20:21,109
I'm dizzy.

562
00:20:21,109 --> 00:20:22,309
We came back alive.

563
00:20:23,276 --> 00:20:24,109
I feel sick.

564
00:20:26,743 --> 00:20:27,776
Thank you.

565
00:20:29,043 --> 00:20:30,709
Did the machine really rotate?

566
00:20:31,376 --> 00:20:35,309
Combat pilots have a hard job.

567
00:20:35,309 --> 00:20:37,309
- It was fun. / - Let's go.

568
00:20:39,143 --> 00:20:40,209
(Indoor action)

569
00:20:40,209 --> 00:20:42,009
- Action enjoyed indoors? / - Here it comes.

570
00:20:42,009 --> 00:20:43,543
Here, here...

571
00:20:46,343 --> 00:20:48,009
Today is the action day.

572
00:20:48,009 --> 00:20:48,843
That's why...

573
00:20:48,843 --> 00:20:50,576
This is for Dujun.

574
00:20:50,576 --> 00:20:53,543
I have prepared a fun, indoor activity we can try.

575
00:20:53,543 --> 00:20:54,909
- For me? / - Of course.

576
00:20:54,909 --> 00:20:55,943
Let's go in first.

577
00:20:55,943 --> 00:20:57,476
- Let's go. / - Let's go.

578
00:20:57,476 --> 00:20:58,743
This is bad.

579
00:20:59,976 --> 00:21:02,209
(Dujun is scared of heights)

580
00:21:02,209 --> 00:21:05,509
(Dujun was going to try paragliding in Laos)

581
00:21:05,509 --> 00:21:07,776
- Oh, really? We can't paraglide today? / - No.

582
00:21:07,776 --> 00:21:10,743
♪ Wind, keep blowing ♪

583
00:21:10,743 --> 00:21:12,209
- Dujun, are you scared of heights? / - Yes.

584
00:21:12,209 --> 00:21:14,109
I had no idea.

585
00:21:14,109 --> 00:21:15,476
- How good is it? / - It was scary.

586
00:21:15,476 --> 00:21:16,776
- We have to get on. / - Gikwang enjoys it, right?

587
00:21:16,776 --> 00:21:18,609
He loves it. He's not afraid of anything.

588
00:21:19,343 --> 00:21:20,643
Hey, check that out.

589
00:21:22,609 --> 00:21:23,276
What is it?

590
00:21:29,043 --> 00:21:30,343
The wind is blowing harder.

591
00:21:32,376 --> 00:21:33,276
Look at that. Look.

592
00:21:33,276 --> 00:21:34,709
What is that?

593
00:21:34,709 --> 00:21:35,943
- No way. I can't believe this. / - Is that a person?

594
00:21:35,943 --> 00:21:37,409
- The one flying is a person? / - Yes, it's a person.

595
00:21:38,343 --> 00:21:39,176
Look at that. Look.

596
00:21:39,176 --> 00:21:40,776
What is that?

597
00:21:40,776 --> 00:21:41,976
- No way. I can't believe this. / - Is that a person?

598
00:21:41,976 --> 00:21:43,443
- The one flying is a person? / - Yes, it's a person.

599
00:21:47,076 --> 00:21:48,676
- Dujun... / - His eyes are about to pop out.

600
00:21:48,676 --> 00:21:50,076
Is he an expert?

601
00:21:50,076 --> 00:21:51,276
- Yes. / - Expert of reactions.

602
00:21:51,276 --> 00:21:52,443
No, no.

603
00:21:52,443 --> 00:21:53,743
The man in the tube.

604
00:21:53,743 --> 00:21:55,276
No, before.

605
00:21:55,276 --> 00:21:55,943
Oh, right...

606
00:21:55,943 --> 00:21:57,209
What are you on about?

607
00:21:57,209 --> 00:21:57,876
I thought...

608
00:21:57,876 --> 00:21:58,676
I thought you meant Dujun...

609
00:21:58,676 --> 00:21:59,909
I thought you were asking about him.

610
00:22:06,343 --> 00:22:08,176
This is amazing.

611
00:22:08,176 --> 00:22:10,809
(Indoor skydiving)

612
00:22:11,943 --> 00:22:13,876
(Indoor skydiving)

613
00:22:13,876 --> 00:22:16,243
(The pan in the bottom blows wind at 50m/s)

614
00:22:16,243 --> 00:22:18,343
(You can enjoy skydiving indoors)

615
00:22:18,343 --> 00:22:23,009
(Indoor skydiving, $76)

616
00:22:23,876 --> 00:22:29,509
(We can almost hear Dujun's eyes rolling)

617
00:22:32,143 --> 00:22:33,609
(Gulp)

618
00:22:33,876 --> 00:22:36,143
This is beyond scary.

619
00:22:36,143 --> 00:22:38,509
You punk. This is so scary.

620
00:22:38,509 --> 00:22:39,309
What is?

621
00:22:40,209 --> 00:22:42,409
You can't do that even if you want to.

622
00:22:43,676 --> 00:22:47,276
Even those who are afraid of heights...

623
00:22:47,276 --> 00:22:49,843
- They can experience it. / - Let's go.

624
00:22:49,843 --> 00:22:51,009
It's that much fun.

625
00:22:51,009 --> 00:22:52,876
Safety comes first

626
00:22:52,876 --> 00:22:54,643
so let's go and get our safety training.

627
00:22:54,643 --> 00:22:57,043
- The safest thing is to not do it. / - There's training.

628
00:22:57,043 --> 00:22:58,976
You must.

629
00:22:58,976 --> 00:23:00,776
It can't be action day without this.

630
00:23:00,776 --> 00:23:03,409
We need to show this level of activity for action day

631
00:23:03,409 --> 00:23:04,309
to the viewers.

632
00:23:04,309 --> 00:23:05,243
- Hey... / - Let's go.

633
00:23:06,876 --> 00:23:07,709
Let's go.

634
00:23:09,609 --> 00:23:11,009
That really looks fun.

635
00:23:11,009 --> 00:23:12,909
Among all the activities so far...

636
00:23:12,909 --> 00:23:14,576
- Yeah. / - It's one of the best ones.

637
00:23:14,576 --> 00:23:15,543
Oh, really?

638
00:23:15,543 --> 00:23:16,443
We can't do that.

639
00:23:18,076 --> 00:23:22,543
(Changing for the skydiving)

640
00:23:22,543 --> 00:23:23,743
We get uniforms.

641
00:23:23,743 --> 00:23:25,609
Can you choose it yourself?

642
00:23:25,609 --> 00:23:26,776
Yes, you can.

643
00:23:26,776 --> 00:23:28,443
- Really? / - They have the Superman costume.

644
00:23:32,909 --> 00:23:39,143
(They receive a safety training beforehand)

645
00:23:40,909 --> 00:23:42,176
This will be fun.

646
00:23:46,176 --> 00:23:47,743
- What's that? / - He looks too sad.

647
00:23:47,743 --> 00:23:49,143
Why is he so depressed?

648
00:23:49,943 --> 00:23:51,043
His eyes...

649
00:23:52,909 --> 00:23:54,476
You have to go one at a time.

650
00:23:54,476 --> 00:23:55,643
Who is first?

651
00:23:56,443 --> 00:23:57,543
Should I go first?

652
00:23:57,543 --> 00:23:58,243
I'll go first.

653
00:23:58,243 --> 00:23:59,443
- You? / - Yeah.

654
00:23:59,443 --> 00:24:00,776
Dujun, let's go!

655
00:24:00,776 --> 00:24:02,409
Is Dujun going first?

656
00:24:02,409 --> 00:24:05,143
I'm a little bit scared.

657
00:24:05,143 --> 00:24:06,709
It's okay.

658
00:24:06,709 --> 00:24:08,243
Hold still.

659
00:24:08,243 --> 00:24:11,209
Hold still please. He...

660
00:24:13,043 --> 00:24:14,643
- Right away? / - Yes, right away.

661
00:24:15,343 --> 00:24:16,843
Let's go Ilsan Spider-Man.

662
00:24:20,809 --> 00:24:23,676
(He can't back out now)

663
00:24:23,676 --> 00:24:27,376
(We trust you, leader)

664
00:24:27,376 --> 00:24:31,243
(Though this isn't real skydiving)

665
00:24:31,376 --> 00:24:36,143
(It's my first skydiving experience!)

666
00:24:41,409 --> 00:24:45,143
(Trembling)

667
00:24:45,143 --> 00:24:47,843
You look more stunned than the girl earlier.

668
00:24:50,743 --> 00:24:52,443
(His body is floating because of the strong wind)

669
00:24:58,009 --> 00:24:59,209
He's good.

670
00:24:59,209 --> 00:25:00,376
He's doing really well.

671
00:25:05,409 --> 00:25:06,343
That's so fascinating.

672
00:25:06,343 --> 00:25:08,476
- Do you float if they crank up the wind? / - Yes, yes.

673
00:25:09,443 --> 00:25:11,476
Depending on how you move your legs and arms...

674
00:25:11,476 --> 00:25:12,943
- You go up higher? / - That's right.

675
00:25:12,943 --> 00:25:14,309
- By yourself... / - You can turn as well.

676
00:25:15,209 --> 00:25:17,109
Shouldn't you close your mouth?

677
00:25:17,109 --> 00:25:18,309
- Your mouth gets dry. / - Right.

678
00:25:18,309 --> 00:25:19,776
You can't close it once you open your mouth.

679
00:25:22,809 --> 00:25:23,776
Dujun!

680
00:25:24,543 --> 00:25:26,243
Close your mouth!

681
00:25:27,543 --> 00:25:29,443
Why are you keeping your mouth open?

682
00:25:29,443 --> 00:25:30,809
Because I'm too excited.

683
00:25:30,809 --> 00:25:32,676
I was so excited. I wanted to scream.

684
00:25:32,676 --> 00:25:33,543
But the wind kept blowing.

685
00:25:33,543 --> 00:25:36,643
The wind is blowing at 250km/hr.

686
00:25:36,643 --> 00:25:37,643
It's blowing.

687
00:25:37,643 --> 00:25:39,209
When you're actually skydiving,

688
00:25:39,209 --> 00:25:40,543
you're attached to an instructor.

689
00:25:40,543 --> 00:25:42,443
- Right. / - But you're doing it alone here.

690
00:25:42,443 --> 00:25:43,643
That's why it's more fun.

691
00:25:49,209 --> 00:25:51,109
- That means he's doing well, right? / - Going up!

692
00:25:51,109 --> 00:25:52,276
He's going up!

693
00:25:58,009 --> 00:25:58,576
Up, up.

694
00:25:58,576 --> 00:26:00,409
- Telling him to go up? / - Going up since he's good?

695
00:26:00,409 --> 00:26:02,143
He's going up.

696
00:26:04,076 --> 00:26:06,109
- That must be scary. / - That's amazing.

697
00:26:06,109 --> 00:26:07,143
That must've been scary.

698
00:26:07,143 --> 00:26:08,576
He looks so jealous.

699
00:26:08,576 --> 00:26:09,876
That must've been a little scary.

700
00:26:09,876 --> 00:26:12,043
- That's so fun. / - You can't feel it going up.

701
00:26:12,943 --> 00:26:18,576
(He flies up to the top)

702
00:26:20,609 --> 00:26:22,309
He should close his mouth.

703
00:26:24,809 --> 00:26:30,243
(Dizzying)

704
00:26:30,243 --> 00:26:32,076
That would be perfect

705
00:26:32,076 --> 00:26:34,143
for skydiving practice.

706
00:26:35,709 --> 00:26:37,376
Gosh, that looks like fun.

707
00:26:37,376 --> 00:26:38,676
That's really awesome.

708
00:26:41,009 --> 00:26:42,343
- He's bringing him out. / - He's out.

709
00:26:43,943 --> 00:26:46,209
- He's wiping his face. / - My nose is running.

710
00:26:49,076 --> 00:26:50,076
Thank you. Thank you.

711
00:26:50,809 --> 00:26:53,976
You have to wipe your nose and mouth.

712
00:26:54,709 --> 00:26:55,743
This is amazing.

713
00:26:58,276 --> 00:26:59,376
It was so much fun.

714
00:27:01,009 --> 00:27:04,343
(Next up is Gikwang)

715
00:27:04,343 --> 00:27:06,043
Gikwang looks like he can do it really well.

716
00:27:06,543 --> 00:27:07,576
That looks like fun.

717
00:27:07,576 --> 00:27:08,476
Yeah, seriously.

718
00:27:13,243 --> 00:27:16,576
(He's flying without any help)

719
00:27:25,976 --> 00:27:26,943
He's cute.

720
00:27:26,943 --> 00:27:28,376
He looks like a flying squirrel.

721
00:27:29,343 --> 00:27:31,176
(Flying squirrel)

722
00:27:33,843 --> 00:27:34,776
He's going up right away.

723
00:27:36,376 --> 00:27:38,409
- Can you grab the wind like this? / - Yes.

724
00:27:38,409 --> 00:27:39,343
- You can. / - Like a ball.

725
00:27:40,809 --> 00:27:43,476
You need quite a bit of muscle strength.

726
00:27:43,476 --> 00:27:45,443
- Like your shoulders. / - Since it goes like this.

727
00:27:45,443 --> 00:27:46,743
You need that support.

728
00:27:46,743 --> 00:27:50,276
(So excited)

729
00:27:52,009 --> 00:27:56,609
(Dizzying height)

730
00:28:04,643 --> 00:28:05,743
You must be thirsty.

731
00:28:07,676 --> 00:28:09,743
That was fun. That was so much fun.

732
00:28:13,309 --> 00:28:15,176
So good! Feeling so good!

733
00:28:16,009 --> 00:28:17,009
It was so much fun.

734
00:28:17,009 --> 00:28:18,109
It's fun.

735
00:28:18,109 --> 00:28:19,843
- It's a lot of fun. / - You must try this.

736
00:28:19,843 --> 00:28:21,043
This is amazing.

737
00:28:21,043 --> 00:28:22,209
Amazing.

738
00:28:22,209 --> 00:28:23,009
Thank you.

739
00:28:23,009 --> 00:28:24,076
How much did it cost?

740
00:28:24,076 --> 00:28:26,543
- How much was it? / - It was $76 per person.

741
00:28:26,543 --> 00:28:27,909
That's worth it.

742
00:28:27,909 --> 00:28:29,243
- It's not cheap. / - For 2 minutes.

743
00:28:29,243 --> 00:28:30,476
You need to eat something.

744
00:28:35,109 --> 00:28:36,576
We're hungry, aren't we?

745
00:28:36,576 --> 00:28:37,543
Very hungry.

746
00:28:37,543 --> 00:28:38,509
So we should try

747
00:28:38,509 --> 00:28:40,876
a traditional English dish.

748
00:28:40,876 --> 00:28:41,976
Soul food.

749
00:28:41,976 --> 00:28:44,043
- Soul food. / - In England...

750
00:28:44,043 --> 00:28:45,009
The food that the English like best...

751
00:28:45,009 --> 00:28:45,776
What is it?

752
00:28:45,776 --> 00:28:46,443
It is...

753
00:28:47,676 --> 00:28:51,276
(A pie shop where you can taste local meat pies)

754
00:28:51,276 --> 00:28:53,543
(They combine traditional pies with a modern touch)

755
00:28:53,543 --> 00:28:56,443
(You can enjoy unique pies with various stuffing)

756
00:28:56,443 --> 00:28:57,143
Pie.

757
00:28:57,143 --> 00:28:58,476
- Meat pie. / - Meat pie.

758
00:28:58,476 --> 00:29:00,476
It's not the pie we know.

759
00:29:00,476 --> 00:29:01,343
What is that?

760
00:29:01,343 --> 00:29:02,576
- I was surprised too. / - It's not a dessert pie.

761
00:29:02,576 --> 00:29:04,309
The pies I know...

762
00:29:04,309 --> 00:29:07,309
- Are like tarts with fruits on top. / - Right.

763
00:29:07,309 --> 00:29:09,009
That's what I thought.

764
00:29:09,009 --> 00:29:12,376
But this restaurant puts meat and this and that,

765
00:29:12,376 --> 00:29:13,276
like ham...

766
00:29:13,276 --> 00:29:15,176
- It's like a meal. / - Yes, a meal.

767
00:29:15,176 --> 00:29:16,476
A pie that's like a meal.

768
00:29:18,476 --> 00:29:20,109
- Hi, guys. / - Hi, guy.

769
00:29:20,109 --> 00:29:20,643
Oh, hi, guys.

770
00:29:20,643 --> 00:29:22,109
Free ranger?

771
00:29:22,109 --> 00:29:23,109
Oh, free ranger?

772
00:29:23,109 --> 00:29:24,209
- Ranger. / - Check this out.

773
00:29:24,809 --> 00:29:26,209
What's this?

774
00:29:26,376 --> 00:29:29,409
(Moodog pie, $11.50)

775
00:29:29,409 --> 00:29:32,476
(Free ranger pie, $11.50)

776
00:29:32,876 --> 00:29:34,509
(Mashed peas, mashed potatoes)

777
00:29:34,509 --> 00:29:36,643
(They look similar on the outside)

778
00:29:36,643 --> 00:29:39,176
English people don't have many soups.

779
00:29:39,176 --> 00:29:40,343
So when it's cold,

780
00:29:40,343 --> 00:29:42,309
they enjoy a warm pie.

781
00:29:42,309 --> 00:29:43,176
Looks tasty.

782
00:29:43,809 --> 00:29:44,976
Let's open it up.

783
00:29:44,976 --> 00:29:47,109
I'm so curious about what's inside.

784
00:29:48,443 --> 00:29:52,343
(Dujun cuts the moodog pie first)

785
00:29:52,343 --> 00:29:53,876
Wow, check this out.

786
00:29:53,876 --> 00:29:54,943
What is it?

787
00:29:54,943 --> 00:29:56,209
It's meat and stuff.

788
00:29:58,176 --> 00:29:59,209
It's a full meal.

789
00:30:02,643 --> 00:30:06,009
(The way he eats makes everyone hungry)

790
00:30:08,309 --> 00:30:09,776
The moodog

791
00:30:09,776 --> 00:30:11,176
has beef inside.

792
00:30:11,176 --> 00:30:14,209
It has beef boiled down in soy sauce. It's not salty.

793
00:30:14,209 --> 00:30:15,243
The pastry is very crispy.

794
00:30:17,243 --> 00:30:19,309
The pastry dough was kneaded with red ale.

795
00:30:19,309 --> 00:30:21,576
That's right. That's what it said on the menu.

796
00:30:21,576 --> 00:30:23,709
You get the whiff of ale as you eat it.

797
00:30:23,709 --> 00:30:24,509
It has that scent.

798
00:30:25,643 --> 00:30:26,543
Chicken gravy...

799
00:30:27,143 --> 00:30:28,076
I'd better pour some.

800
00:30:29,243 --> 00:30:30,509
It's pretty.

801
00:30:30,509 --> 00:30:32,576
The women would like this.

802
00:30:32,576 --> 00:30:33,476
It's pretty.

803
00:30:33,476 --> 00:30:35,643
It'd make a great picture to

804
00:30:35,643 --> 00:30:36,676
put up on your SNS.

805
00:30:36,676 --> 00:30:39,309
(Great visuals)

806
00:30:40,443 --> 00:30:41,809
That looks so good.

807
00:30:42,543 --> 00:30:43,809
I haven't eaten yet.

808
00:30:45,009 --> 00:30:45,876
I should've had food first.

809
00:30:46,709 --> 00:30:48,776
- The potato is good. / - I'll open it up.

810
00:30:49,576 --> 00:30:50,609
What does it look like?

811
00:30:53,276 --> 00:30:54,243
It's chicken.

812
00:30:54,243 --> 00:30:56,476
- It looks good. / - It does.

813
00:30:56,476 --> 00:30:58,676
I find this pie fascinating.

814
00:31:02,376 --> 00:31:06,609
(How does the chicken pie taste?)

815
00:31:08,043 --> 00:31:10,809
It has the crunchiness of the crust

816
00:31:10,809 --> 00:31:13,809
and the chicken inside is so tender.

817
00:31:19,009 --> 00:31:20,643
That looks good.

818
00:31:20,643 --> 00:31:22,476
Great with a glass of wine.

819
00:31:28,076 --> 00:31:28,876
It's so good.

820
00:31:28,876 --> 00:31:29,609
It is.

821
00:31:29,609 --> 00:31:31,309
Does it taste like a sandwich?

822
00:31:31,309 --> 00:31:32,943
What does it taste like?

823
00:31:32,943 --> 00:31:35,043
It tastes more like a dumpling

824
00:31:35,043 --> 00:31:36,443
rather than a sandwich.

825
00:31:36,443 --> 00:31:37,443
Dumpling!

826
00:31:37,443 --> 00:31:38,376
That makes sense.

827
00:31:38,376 --> 00:31:39,376
Let's bring in...

828
00:31:40,176 --> 00:31:40,909
The secret weapon.

829
00:31:44,243 --> 00:31:46,476
- Isn't that the all purpose sauce? / - Yes.

830
00:31:46,476 --> 00:31:47,343
They have sauces too.

831
00:31:47,343 --> 00:31:49,109
Oh, sauces.

832
00:31:49,109 --> 00:31:51,543
Fruity brown sauce...

833
00:31:51,543 --> 00:31:54,109
I think they made their own special sauce.

834
00:31:54,776 --> 00:31:56,076
- Spicy. / - I've never seen anything like this.

835
00:31:56,076 --> 00:31:57,176
Once you add this...

836
00:31:58,609 --> 00:31:59,609
It's so good.

837
00:32:00,843 --> 00:32:01,743
Okay.

838
00:32:01,743 --> 00:32:03,476
That must be spicy.

839
00:32:03,476 --> 00:32:04,443
It's not that spicy.

840
00:32:04,443 --> 00:32:05,309
Really?

841
00:32:05,309 --> 00:32:06,743
Spicy for English people

842
00:32:06,743 --> 00:32:08,876
isn't that spicy for Koreans.

843
00:32:10,709 --> 00:32:13,276
(This is good)

844
00:32:13,409 --> 00:32:14,943
For the Korean tourists.

845
00:32:15,876 --> 00:32:17,176
If you want a spicy taste...

846
00:32:17,176 --> 00:32:18,909
Since there are different sauces...

847
00:32:18,909 --> 00:32:21,043
- You'd get a different flavor. / - It's good.

848
00:32:22,176 --> 00:32:23,009
It's really good.

849
00:32:25,709 --> 00:32:26,443
Hey!

850
00:32:26,943 --> 00:32:27,509
Hey!

851
00:32:27,509 --> 00:32:28,276
Huh?

852
00:32:28,276 --> 00:32:29,776
This is it

853
00:32:29,776 --> 00:32:31,109
- That's the stuff? / - Close the lid.

854
00:32:33,943 --> 00:32:35,476
Why? Why? Is this better?

855
00:32:35,476 --> 00:32:36,476
This is way better.

856
00:32:36,476 --> 00:32:38,243
(Gikwang tries the sauce Dujun recommends)

857
00:32:38,243 --> 00:32:40,343
I want to know what that tastes like.

858
00:32:40,343 --> 00:32:42,576
It's like an all purpose soy sauce.

859
00:32:49,809 --> 00:32:50,709
(In awe)

860
00:32:51,076 --> 00:32:52,609
This makes it refreshing.

861
00:32:52,609 --> 00:32:53,509
It does, right?

862
00:32:53,509 --> 00:32:55,709
The pie can taste a bit heavy...

863
00:32:56,576 --> 00:32:58,209
But because the sauce is fruity...

864
00:32:58,209 --> 00:33:00,143
- Open the lid on this one. / - It's good.

865
00:33:00,143 --> 00:33:02,309
- It looks really good. / - It does look good.

866
00:33:02,309 --> 00:33:03,343
That was really delicious.

867
00:33:03,343 --> 00:33:04,543
It'd be really heavy.

868
00:33:04,543 --> 00:33:06,976
Isn't the pie too heavy for Asians?

869
00:33:06,976 --> 00:33:08,843
- Isn't it too greasy? / - That sauce...

870
00:33:08,843 --> 00:33:10,309
Takes care of the heaviness.

871
00:33:10,909 --> 00:33:12,343
I ate it all.

872
00:33:13,076 --> 00:33:14,343
I ate it all while we were talking.

00:33:22,476 --> 00:33:23,976
I like going for walks.

878
00:33:23,976 --> 00:33:25,509
I like walking around.

879
00:33:25,509 --> 00:33:26,576
Walking around slowly

880
00:33:26,576 --> 00:33:27,876
and enjoying the area...

881
00:33:28,709 --> 00:33:29,309
Should I look it up?

882
00:33:29,309 --> 00:33:32,143
A way to enjoy the nature.

883
00:33:32,143 --> 00:33:33,409

In England,

people call it the heart and soul of walking.

889
00:33:45,943 --> 00:33:47,809
- The heart of walking? / - Heart of walking?

890
00:33:47,809 --> 00:33:50,243
England must like hearts.

891
00:33:51,043 --> 00:33:52,843
- Never heard of that before. / - It's passionate.

00:34:35,376 --> 00:34:36,609
A place you don't want to live before retirement.

908
00:34:36,609 --> 00:34:37,809
- A place of healing. / - It's beautiful.

909
00:34:38,609 --> 00:34:40,176
- Chosen by English people. / - It's like a theme park.

910
00:34:40,176 --> 00:34:43,543
That's right, it seemed like a village from a fairy tale.

911
00:34:43,543 --> 00:34:45,709
It looks more like Switzerland than England.

912
00:34:45,709 --> 00:34:48,176
- That's right. / - It's more like that.

913
00:34:49,976 --> 00:34:52,343
(The highlight of Windermere)

914
00:34:56,476 --> 00:34:57,576
Your legs must have hurt.

915
00:34:57,576 --> 00:34:58,476
It looks like Bukhansan.

916
00:34:58,476 --> 00:35:00,476
- We only had to walk for 20 minutes. / - No!

917
00:35:00,476 --> 00:35:01,976
- Your legs must have hurt. / - It was really low.

918
00:35:02,476 --> 00:35:05,643
(Everyone can easily go on this course)

919
00:35:06,809 --> 00:35:11,409
(A panoramic view if you only walk for 20 minutes)

920
00:35:11,409 --> 00:35:16,743
(Lake District)

921
00:35:19,109 --> 00:35:20,909
Let's go for a walk then.

922
00:35:22,276 --> 00:35:23,943
Isn't this a nice walk?

923
00:35:24,809 --> 00:35:26,276
- Are those houses? / - Yes.

924
00:35:26,976 --> 00:35:30,109
That's the true landscape of England.

925
00:35:30,109 --> 00:35:31,476
Outside of the major city.

926
00:35:31,476 --> 00:35:33,009
It feels like you can smell the leaves.

927
00:35:33,643 --> 00:35:36,943
Doesn't it feel like you're chewing xylitol gum?

928
00:35:36,943 --> 00:35:37,909
- Right? / - It's refreshing.

929
00:35:37,909 --> 00:35:40,009
The air is so clean.

930
00:35:41,976 --> 00:35:42,943
It feels cool.

931
00:35:45,709 --> 00:35:47,143
This tree is amazing.

932
00:35:51,476 --> 00:35:53,343
I wonder how old it is.

933
00:35:53,343 --> 00:35:55,043
- It looks at least 100 years old. / - At least 100 years.

934
00:35:57,176 --> 00:35:59,076
This is really amazing.

935
00:36:01,309 --> 00:36:02,809
It doesn't have the full effect on screen.

936
00:36:02,809 --> 00:36:03,976
You have to see it for yourself...

937
00:36:03,976 --> 00:36:06,509
- To get a sense of the beauty. / - Really?

938
00:36:09,809 --> 00:36:12,643
(They meet a bird on the way)

939
00:36:12,643 --> 00:36:13,376
Robin?

940
00:36:15,643 --> 00:36:16,443
Look at him.

941
00:36:16,443 --> 00:36:18,343
It isn't hiding from the camera.

942
00:36:19,609 --> 00:36:21,043
He's knows something.

943
00:36:23,643 --> 00:36:25,276
- It sat there. / - It's so cute.

944
00:36:25,276 --> 00:36:27,243
- It's so cute. / - It's so round.

945
00:36:27,243 --> 00:36:28,276
It looks like a toy.

946
00:36:29,309 --> 00:36:31,243
(Do you have anything to eat?)

947
00:36:36,309 --> 00:36:37,443
- It comes to you? / - It does?

948
00:36:37,909 --> 00:36:39,409
- Oh, my. / - It came to me!

949
00:36:42,376 --> 00:36:44,143
- Oh, my. That's so cute. / - Incredible!

950
00:36:44,876 --> 00:36:47,309
- It doesn't have a natural enemy. / - Must be full.

951
00:36:47,309 --> 00:36:48,209
It's not afraid.

952
00:36:49,443 --> 00:36:50,843
We're near the top.

953
00:36:50,843 --> 00:36:51,543
- Top? / - Top?

954
00:36:51,543 --> 00:36:52,609
Near the top.

955
00:36:53,943 --> 00:36:54,876
We're almost there.

956
00:36:56,709 --> 00:36:57,676
We're almost there.

957
00:36:59,109 --> 00:37:01,043
We're almost at the top.

958
00:37:01,543 --> 00:37:04,376
Once we go up here...

959
00:37:09,309 --> 00:37:11,509
How is this possible?

960
00:37:12,309 --> 00:37:14,243
This is awesome.

961
00:37:14,809 --> 00:37:16,376
This is unbelievable.

962
00:37:19,543 --> 00:37:20,976
How is this possible?

963
00:37:21,776 --> 00:37:24,009
This is awesome.

964
00:37:26,109 --> 00:37:26,909
It's pretty.

965
00:37:26,909 --> 00:37:29,143
You can see everything in one glance.

966
00:37:30,343 --> 00:37:32,376
- That's only after 20 minutes? / - For real.

967
00:37:32,376 --> 00:37:33,843
It takes 15 to 20 minutes.

968
00:37:34,909 --> 00:37:36,543
It really is the classic English scene.

969
00:37:37,443 --> 00:37:40,109
I knew why they want to live here after retirement.

970
00:37:40,109 --> 00:37:41,143
I think I know why.

971
00:37:43,043 --> 00:37:44,009
Check this out.

972
00:37:44,009 --> 00:37:53,176
(The view is all around you)

973
00:37:54,409 --> 00:37:56,709
The National Geographic chose this place among

974
00:37:56,709 --> 00:37:59,409
50 places you have to see before you die.

975
00:37:59,409 --> 00:38:00,576
It's on that list?

976
00:38:01,409 --> 00:38:02,809
It looks so nice.

977
00:38:03,309 --> 00:38:10,476
(Lake District)

978
00:38:16,576 --> 00:38:18,276
This is so interesting.

979
00:38:18,276 --> 00:38:20,043
It's not that high.

980
00:38:20,043 --> 00:38:22,376
- It's like a neighborhood hill. / - I know.

981
00:38:22,376 --> 00:38:23,976
Jeongbalsan in Ilsan seems higher.

982
00:38:23,976 --> 00:38:25,009
Right.

983
00:38:25,009 --> 00:38:26,743
- Seriously... / - But the view...

984
00:38:26,743 --> 00:38:28,276
- It's so low... / - How is this possible?

985
00:38:28,276 --> 00:38:30,943
Being able to see a

986
00:38:30,943 --> 00:38:32,043
360 degree view...

987
00:38:34,409 --> 00:38:35,943
Have you heard about Wordsworth?

988
00:38:35,943 --> 00:38:37,043
- No, I haven't heard about him. / - He's a poet.

989
00:38:37,043 --> 00:38:38,643
I haven't either.

990
00:38:38,643 --> 00:38:40,876
There's a poet named William Wordsworth

991
00:38:40,876 --> 00:38:43,543
and he's from this neighborhood.

992
00:38:43,543 --> 00:38:46,376
I think he saw this view when...

993
00:38:46,376 --> 00:38:51,509
- He wrote the poem, "Daffodils." / - He must have.

994
00:38:51,509 --> 00:38:54,676
Let's project ourselves like the poet...

995
00:38:54,676 --> 00:38:56,109
I'll recite the poem.

996
00:38:56,109 --> 00:38:57,709
What are they doing suddenly?

997
00:38:58,609 --> 00:39:00,043
He wanted to read it there.

998
00:39:01,343 --> 00:39:04,343
"I wandered lonely as a cloud..."

999
00:39:04,343 --> 00:39:06,843
- "That floats on high o'er vales and hills." / - Dujun...

1000
00:39:06,843 --> 00:39:08,509
- He's so sentimental. / - "When all at once..."

1001
00:39:08,509 --> 00:39:10,076
"I saw a crowd,

1002
00:39:10,076 --> 00:39:12,143
A host, of golden daffodils."

1003
00:39:12,809 --> 00:39:14,443
"Ten thousand saw I at a glance,

1004
00:39:14,443 --> 00:39:16,909
Tossing their heads in sprightly dance."

1005
00:39:17,509 --> 00:39:19,976
"The waves beside them danced but they

1006
00:39:19,976 --> 00:39:22,709
Out-did the sparkling waves in glee.

1007
00:39:22,709 --> 00:39:24,743
For oft, when on my couch I lie

1008
00:39:24,743 --> 00:39:26,509
In vacant or in pensive mood,

1009
00:39:26,509 --> 00:39:29,076
They flash upon that inward eye

1010
00:39:29,076 --> 00:39:31,809
Which is the bliss of solitude."

1011
00:39:31,809 --> 00:39:32,809
"The bliss of solitude."

1012
00:39:32,809 --> 00:39:35,709
He wrote this when he was alone.

1013
00:39:35,709 --> 00:39:38,309
"For oft, when on my couch I lie

1014
00:39:38,309 --> 00:39:40,309
In vacant or in pensive mood..."

1015
00:39:40,309 --> 00:39:41,609
Isn't it over yet?

1016
00:39:43,276 --> 00:39:44,143
Dujun!

1017
00:39:44,143 --> 00:39:45,709
I love this part.

1018
00:39:45,709 --> 00:39:47,276
"Which is the bliss of solitude."

1019
00:39:47,276 --> 00:39:49,376
When he says "the bliss of solitude," it's a paradox.

1020
00:39:49,376 --> 00:39:50,509
Like the silent scream.

1021
00:39:50,509 --> 00:39:52,609
Just as we learned...

1022
00:39:52,609 --> 00:39:53,809
The bliss of solitude.

1023
00:39:53,809 --> 00:39:55,976
You can really feel the bliss of solitude.

1024
00:39:55,976 --> 00:39:58,776
To be honest, if I go to England,

1025
00:39:58,776 --> 00:40:00,843
I want to rent a place and stay overnight there.

1026
00:40:00,843 --> 00:40:02,943
It's really worth it there.

1027
00:40:09,609 --> 00:40:11,276
It went by so fast.

1028
00:40:11,276 --> 00:40:15,043
I was worried they would only show soccer stuff.

1029
00:40:15,043 --> 00:40:16,643
There was a lot to see.

1030
00:40:16,643 --> 00:40:18,243
- Not at all. / - There were lots of surprises.

1031
00:40:18,243 --> 00:40:21,043
I thought the pie would be like a walnut pie.

1032
00:40:21,043 --> 00:40:22,509
But it was a meal.

1033
00:40:22,509 --> 00:40:24,009
Your activity was amazing too.

1034
00:40:24,009 --> 00:40:25,676
The activity was awesome.

1035
00:40:25,676 --> 00:40:27,043
- How was it really? / - I wanted to try it.

1036
00:40:27,043 --> 00:40:30,343
From what I know, actual skydiving...

1037
00:40:30,343 --> 00:40:32,843
- Lasts about a minute. / - Less than a minute.

1038
00:40:32,843 --> 00:40:35,043
It lasts only that long.

1039
00:40:35,043 --> 00:40:37,309
But for $76...

1040
00:40:37,309 --> 00:40:39,576
- It's affordable too. / - For that cost...

1041
00:40:39,576 --> 00:40:41,143
- You can fly for 2 minutes. / - 2 minutes.

1042
00:40:41,143 --> 00:40:43,309
- It's double. / - You can fly indoors.

1043
00:40:43,309 --> 00:40:45,043
- With your mouth wide open. / - Yes.

1044
00:40:45,043 --> 00:40:47,143
The lower part looks okay but isn't it scary...

1045
00:40:47,143 --> 00:40:49,409
- When you went up? / - Not at all.

1046
00:40:49,409 --> 00:40:51,609
The Lake District...

1047
00:40:51,609 --> 00:40:54,576
- We have to point some things out. / - What?

1048
00:40:54,576 --> 00:40:58,276
It's 1 of the 50 places you must see before you die.

1049
00:40:58,876 --> 00:41:03,343
Before the apartments were built in Dongtan...

1050
00:41:03,343 --> 00:41:04,743
It used to look like that.

1051
00:41:06,309 --> 00:41:07,543
- The new city of Dongtan. / - Right.

1052
00:41:08,643 --> 00:41:10,743
- Hey, come on. / - Before the new apartments.

1053
00:41:10,743 --> 00:41:12,709
- Dongtan... / - From what we saw...

1054
00:41:12,709 --> 00:41:14,309
We just felt the air was clean.

1055
00:41:14,309 --> 00:41:15,476
What was it actually like?

1056
00:41:15,476 --> 00:41:19,143
It felt like I went inside a movie scene.

1057
00:41:19,143 --> 00:41:20,876
There were trees...

1058
00:41:20,876 --> 00:41:23,609
- And the sky. / - There were birds.

1059
00:41:23,609 --> 00:41:25,109
- The bird came to you. / - The bird was cute.

1060
00:41:25,109 --> 00:41:26,409
- The bird was incredible. / - Right.

1061
00:41:26,409 --> 00:41:27,776
That bird was really cute.

1062
00:41:27,776 --> 00:41:29,609
It played a huge role.

1063
00:41:29,609 --> 00:41:32,743
The first half of the Manchester HighMan Tour.

1064
00:41:32,743 --> 00:41:36,309
Would you visit Manchester or not?

1065
00:41:36,309 --> 00:41:38,409
Please vote!

1066
00:41:40,143 --> 00:41:42,209
(HighMan Tour planned a trip to Manchester)

1067
00:41:42,976 --> 00:41:45,909
(What will the judges choose?)

1068
00:41:46,909 --> 00:41:49,243
It's only the first vote so let's take it lightly.

1069
00:41:49,243 --> 00:41:51,909
What do you think your score is?

1070
00:41:51,909 --> 00:41:54,143
- Out of 100. / - It'll be over 80.

1071
00:41:54,143 --> 00:41:55,509
- Over 80. / - It's my third time.

1072
00:41:55,509 --> 00:41:55,909
Yes.

1073
00:41:55,909 --> 00:41:57,809
- The look on their faces... / - You can see it?

1074
00:41:57,809 --> 00:42:00,543
It's the worst I've seen in the 3 times I was here.

1075
00:42:00,543 --> 00:42:02,109
I'm worried right now.

1076
00:42:02,876 --> 00:42:04,009
It looks like he's enjoying it.

1077
00:42:04,009 --> 00:42:05,543
- Because... / - It's only the first half.

1078
00:42:05,543 --> 00:42:08,309
A great victory to us...

1079
00:42:08,309 --> 00:42:11,043
I don't want to hurt Dujun.

1080
00:42:11,043 --> 00:42:12,109
But...

1081
00:42:14,276 --> 00:42:17,509
It's high, right? Jonghyuk is shocked.

1082
00:42:18,376 --> 00:42:22,309
This is your doing.

1083
00:42:23,643 --> 00:42:24,643
It's high.

1084
00:42:26,876 --> 00:42:27,909
Is that high?

1085
00:42:27,909 --> 00:42:28,809
- It's high. / - Dujun.

1086
00:42:28,809 --> 00:42:30,676
- It's high. / - It's your third time.

1087
00:42:30,676 --> 00:42:32,343
So you know just by seeing them.

1088
00:42:32,343 --> 00:42:35,009
I think the score is either really high or really low.

1089
00:42:35,009 --> 00:42:36,809
The first half score is

1090
00:42:36,809 --> 00:42:40,143
just to test whether your buttons are working.

1091
00:42:40,143 --> 00:42:41,176
It doesn't mean much.

1092
00:42:41,176 --> 00:42:43,809
After seeing Lake District...

1093
00:42:43,809 --> 00:42:45,509
It's the score I thought it deserved.

1094
00:42:45,509 --> 00:42:48,209
Out of 100. Fine.

1095
00:42:48,209 --> 00:42:50,143
Anyway, it's the first half.

1096
00:42:50,143 --> 00:42:53,209
- It's just a teaser. / - The highlight is the second half.

1097
00:42:53,209 --> 00:42:54,276
We need to rush it here.

1098
00:42:54,276 --> 00:42:55,876
We have to watch the second half.

1099
00:42:55,876 --> 00:42:56,509
Soccer.

1100
00:42:57,976 --> 00:42:59,443
It's soccer...

1101
00:43:00,643 --> 00:43:03,643
- With soccer... / - What else is there?

1102
00:43:03,643 --> 00:43:04,909
Dujun is a little shocked.

1103
00:43:04,909 --> 00:43:05,876
- What else? / - Is it all soccer?

1104
00:43:07,209 --> 00:43:08,643
I'm a little worried.

1105
00:43:08,643 --> 00:43:12,009
There are a lot of female judges today.

1106
00:43:12,009 --> 00:43:15,143
If you continue to talk about soccer here,

1107
00:43:15,143 --> 00:43:16,776
the votes might decrease.

1108
00:43:16,776 --> 00:43:18,943
Female judges,

1109
00:43:18,943 --> 00:43:21,409
please open your minds a little towards soccer.

1110
00:43:21,409 --> 00:43:23,543
Put away your prejudice against soccer.

1111
00:43:23,543 --> 00:43:25,509
Think of 2002.

1112
00:43:25,509 --> 00:43:26,876
- Everyone. / - Imagine how fun it'd be.

1113
00:43:26,876 --> 00:43:31,076
Everyone! In just 3 months, it's the World Cup.

1114
00:43:31,076 --> 00:43:32,943
Don't forget that.

1115
00:43:32,943 --> 00:43:35,409
Picture that passion and let's watch

1116
00:43:35,409 --> 00:43:37,076
the second half.

1117
00:43:39,309 --> 00:43:42,309
First of all, we must watch soccer.

1118
00:43:42,309 --> 00:43:44,009
We must watch soccer.

1119
00:43:44,009 --> 00:43:45,209
- It's a life dream. / - Of course.

1120
00:43:45,209 --> 00:43:47,009
It's a dream so we'll watch it.

1121
00:43:47,009 --> 00:43:48,676
There's that thing...

1122
00:43:48,676 --> 00:43:50,476
- What? / - The Manchester derby.

1123
00:43:50,476 --> 00:43:51,976
It's next week.

1124
00:43:52,609 --> 00:43:54,509
- You're right. / - Yeah, it's next week.

1125
00:43:54,509 --> 00:43:58,909
(It's the biggest soccer league in the world)

1126
00:43:59,609 --> 00:44:02,209
- I really want to go there. / - One must go there.

1127
00:44:02,509 --> 00:44:05,376
(40 home matches without a loss)

1128
00:44:05,376 --> 00:44:08,376
(The invincible Manchester United)

1129
00:44:08,543 --> 00:44:11,209
(The only undefeated team in the 2018 season)

1130
00:44:11,209 --> 00:44:13,309
(And the strongest club in the European League)

1131
00:44:14,243 --> 00:44:15,843
(Going for their 13th win in a row, Manchester City)

1132
00:44:15,843 --> 00:44:17,509
We'll get real reactions here.

1133
00:44:17,509 --> 00:44:19,543
Serious, I was so happy.

1134
00:44:19,543 --> 00:44:21,643
(However)

1135
00:44:22,409 --> 00:44:24,743
- But then... / - Because of the snow?

1136
00:44:25,109 --> 00:44:27,043
- Canceled? / - If the weather is too bad...

1137
00:44:27,043 --> 00:44:29,343
- Is the game... / - Yes, if it's really bad...

1138
00:44:29,343 --> 00:44:32,409
The game could get canceled.

1139
00:44:32,409 --> 00:44:33,376
What's going on?

1140
00:44:33,376 --> 00:44:34,509
This is just the start.

1141
00:44:34,509 --> 00:44:35,476
- It's just the start? / - Yes.

1142
00:44:35,476 --> 00:44:37,476
My goodness. I thought the soccer was over.

1143
00:44:37,476 --> 00:44:39,776
- This is football day. / - Is action day over?

1144
00:44:39,776 --> 00:44:41,909
- Action day was over long ago. / - I see.

1145
00:44:41,909 --> 00:44:44,043
Before we start football day...

1146
00:44:44,043 --> 00:44:47,043
When it comes to the U.K., it's the home of soccer...

1147
00:44:47,043 --> 00:44:48,043
- Gikwang. / - Yes?

1148
00:44:48,043 --> 00:44:50,009
What's with the bag?

1149
00:44:50,009 --> 00:44:51,476
It's just a bag.

1150
00:44:51,476 --> 00:44:53,809
- If you carry it on your back... / - They'll steal it.

1151
00:44:53,809 --> 00:44:54,809
They can steal everything.

1152
00:44:54,809 --> 00:44:56,476
- You can be pick-pocketed. / - Must wear it forward.

1153
00:44:56,476 --> 00:44:58,109
Before we start football day...

1154
00:44:58,109 --> 00:45:01,743
When it comes to the U.K., it's the home of soccer...

1155
00:45:01,743 --> 00:45:05,409
They really live a life of soccer here.

1156
00:45:05,409 --> 00:45:08,943
We'll take a time of learning.

1157
00:45:08,943 --> 00:45:10,376
- Let's go. / - Let's head inside.

1158
00:45:13,309 --> 00:45:15,843
- Goodness. / - It's a soccer shrine.

1159
00:45:17,809 --> 00:45:19,209
- What is this? / - They're playing this.

1160
00:45:19,209 --> 00:45:20,876
- What is that? / - Is it pool?

1161
00:45:21,609 --> 00:45:23,076
They play pool with soccer?

1162
00:45:23,076 --> 00:45:25,043
It's pool with your feet.

1163
00:45:25,043 --> 00:45:26,709
It really is the city of soccer.

1164
00:45:27,576 --> 00:45:30,276
- Foot pool? / - I want to try that.

1165
00:45:30,276 --> 00:45:31,709
Foot pool.

1166
00:45:32,109 --> 00:45:34,643
(Foot pool, $11.50 for 45 minutes)

1167
00:45:34,643 --> 00:45:35,809
- Join? / - Yeah.

1168
00:45:36,343 --> 00:45:38,109
- Really? / - Yeah.

1169
00:45:38,109 --> 00:45:39,376
Where are you guys from?

1170
00:45:39,376 --> 00:45:41,176
- Korea. / - South Korea.

1171
00:45:42,276 --> 00:45:42,809
Korea.

1172
00:45:42,809 --> 00:45:45,509
(They start with greetings)

1173
00:45:45,509 --> 00:45:48,343
- You're playing 2 on 2? / - Yes.

1174
00:45:48,676 --> 00:45:52,943
(Korea vs. England, a battle of pride)

1175
00:45:54,109 --> 00:45:56,209
(The match begins)

1176
00:46:00,809 --> 00:46:02,809
Is that bad?

1177
00:46:03,643 --> 00:46:05,076
I tried a fake.

1178
00:46:07,543 --> 00:46:09,543
(They score one point each)

1179
00:46:10,276 --> 00:46:12,109
Nice shot. Nice shot, boss.

1180
00:46:13,443 --> 00:46:15,476
They're pros.

1181
00:46:17,776 --> 00:46:19,876
- Okay? / - They're going easy on us.

1182
00:46:20,843 --> 00:46:22,309
- I don't have an angle. / - Just tap it.

1183
00:46:22,309 --> 00:46:23,709
It's not easy to hit that.

1184
00:46:24,543 --> 00:46:26,576
- I don't have an angle. / - Just tap it.

1185
00:46:26,576 --> 00:46:28,076
Just push it with your sole.

1186
00:46:28,076 --> 00:46:31,176
Is it okay to hit the black ball?

1187
00:46:31,176 --> 00:46:32,109
You can hit it.

1188
00:46:32,109 --> 00:46:34,743
- So long as you don't put it in. / - Just hit it, right?

1189
00:46:34,743 --> 00:46:35,343
Try it.

1190
00:46:36,843 --> 00:46:40,476
- That won't do. / - It's going in. It went in.

1191
00:46:40,476 --> 00:46:41,976
It went in.

1192
00:46:47,676 --> 00:46:48,776
It's in.

1193
00:46:49,943 --> 00:46:52,043
- Did they score the wrong ball? / - It was a mistake.

1194
00:46:52,043 --> 00:46:54,209
- You lose if the black ball goes in, right? / - Right.

1195
00:46:55,709 --> 00:46:57,243
We win.

1196
00:46:57,243 --> 00:46:58,809
Is it over?

1197
00:46:59,476 --> 00:47:00,943
Is it over?

1198
00:47:01,743 --> 00:47:03,609
- Is it over? / - That's how it ended.

1199
00:47:05,109 --> 00:47:06,376
What the?

1200
00:47:06,376 --> 00:47:08,043
- You failed. / - They failed.

1201
00:47:08,043 --> 00:47:09,576
That black ball...

1202
00:47:09,576 --> 00:47:13,343
- Is the same black ball in pool. / - It's the 8 ball.

1203
00:47:13,343 --> 00:47:15,676
What's the most important thing here?

1204
00:47:15,676 --> 00:47:16,243
What is it?

1205
00:47:16,243 --> 00:47:18,276
It's the gear. We don't have the right gear.

1206
00:47:18,276 --> 00:47:19,709
We have the wrong shoes.

1207
00:47:20,009 --> 00:47:21,476
(He blames the shoes)

1208
00:47:22,009 --> 00:47:25,009
- One more game. / - One more time.

1209
00:47:27,043 --> 00:47:29,443
We should've worn sneakers at least.

1210
00:47:31,809 --> 00:47:33,676
Okay.

1211
00:47:34,043 --> 00:47:35,343
Nice shot.

1212
00:47:36,076 --> 00:47:37,876
The wind is in the opposite direction.

1213
00:47:38,743 --> 00:47:41,043
(A precise shot)

1214
00:47:41,043 --> 00:47:42,409
Nice shot.

1215
00:47:42,976 --> 00:47:44,643
Wow, Dujun.

1216
00:47:44,643 --> 00:47:45,676
Very nice.

1217
00:47:45,676 --> 00:47:46,509
Professional.

1218
00:47:46,509 --> 00:47:48,376
Nice shot, boss.

1219
00:47:49,943 --> 00:47:52,809
Since we can't score...

1220
00:47:52,809 --> 00:47:54,809
- We'll disrupt them. / - Interfere.

1221
00:47:56,109 --> 00:47:57,476
Okay.

1222
00:47:57,476 --> 00:47:58,776
(Gives it a light tap)

1223
00:48:02,343 --> 00:48:03,643
- We disrupt them. / - No, no?

1224
00:48:03,643 --> 00:48:05,476
You have to hit the ball.

1225
00:48:05,476 --> 00:48:07,376
- You have to hit the ball. / - Really?

1226
00:48:07,376 --> 00:48:09,076
Go again, go on.

1227
00:48:09,076 --> 00:48:10,376
- Go again? / - Try again.

1228
00:48:10,376 --> 00:48:11,909
Try again?

1229
00:48:13,709 --> 00:48:15,009
Darn it.

1230
00:48:15,943 --> 00:48:16,809
Okay.

1231
00:48:16,809 --> 00:48:19,043
(The U.K. team fails to score)

1232
00:48:19,043 --> 00:48:22,276
He did that on purpose. Let's give them a chance.

1233
00:48:22,276 --> 00:48:23,676
We have our pride.

1234
00:48:23,676 --> 00:48:25,176
- He'll score it. / - They're doing it on purpose.

1235
00:48:25,176 --> 00:48:27,743
- Go easy on them. / - I'll show them a performance.

1236
00:48:30,676 --> 00:48:33,009
(Relaxed)

1237
00:48:35,743 --> 00:48:37,976
(Might as well do it right)

1238
00:48:51,509 --> 00:48:52,976
They might win.

1239
00:48:56,643 --> 00:48:57,543
That was fun.

1240
00:48:57,543 --> 00:48:59,676
(Score the black ball last to win)

1241
00:49:00,576 --> 00:49:03,509
(U.K. team continues to fail)

1242
00:49:06,909 --> 00:49:08,509
This isn't easy.

1243
00:49:08,509 --> 00:49:10,609
- I think this would be easy. / - Like this?

1244
00:49:10,609 --> 00:49:12,476
We have to do this here.

1245
00:49:12,476 --> 00:49:13,476
I'll measure it for you.

1246
00:49:14,909 --> 00:49:17,476
(Measuring the angle)

1247
00:49:19,409 --> 00:49:21,676
- Here? / - Okay. I'll hold it here.

1248
00:49:22,209 --> 00:49:23,443
I think it's about here.

1249
00:49:23,443 --> 00:49:25,643
- The 8 ball. / - Yeah, about here.

1250
00:49:26,909 --> 00:49:28,643
(Here I go)

1251
00:49:28,643 --> 00:49:29,776
That looks really difficult.

1252
00:49:30,043 --> 00:49:31,043
Using the cushion.

1253
00:49:33,243 --> 00:49:35,276
No, no.

1254
00:49:36,943 --> 00:49:38,443
(Close)

1255
00:49:38,443 --> 00:49:39,609
It's blocked.

1256
00:49:40,709 --> 00:49:43,009
(U.K. team tries a teamwork shot too)

1257
00:49:44,776 --> 00:49:47,176
(It heads towards the orange ball)

1258
00:49:47,176 --> 00:49:48,343
They lost.

1259
00:49:48,343 --> 00:49:49,776
- It might go in. / - The black ball.

1260
00:49:50,576 --> 00:49:52,843
Nice shot!

1261
00:49:53,409 --> 00:49:56,243
(It keeps going towards the black ball)

1262
00:49:56,243 --> 00:49:58,109
(Please, no...)

1263
00:49:58,109 --> 00:50:00,843
Nice shot!

1264
00:50:02,576 --> 00:50:04,376
(Proud to watch it again)

1265
00:50:05,043 --> 00:50:06,443
- Thank you. / - Good game.

1266
00:50:06,443 --> 00:50:07,876
- Good game. / - Good game.

1267
00:50:08,809 --> 00:50:11,176
Is that the trend in the U.K.?

1268
00:50:11,176 --> 00:50:12,543
Or is that the only place with foot pool?

1269
00:50:12,543 --> 00:50:15,276
- Is it popular? / - Yes, it's even in Korea.

1270
00:50:15,276 --> 00:50:16,809
- What? / - It's in Korea too.

1271
00:50:16,809 --> 00:50:19,209
They have those in Futsal stadiums.

1272
00:50:19,209 --> 00:50:20,876
Why did you pack your bags?

1273
00:50:26,509 --> 00:50:29,476
What was our tour again?

1274
00:50:30,709 --> 00:50:32,743
- The HighMan Tour. / - HighMan Tour.

1275
00:50:32,743 --> 00:50:35,443
Highlight in Manchester.

1276
00:50:35,443 --> 00:50:39,509
This is the place we've been waiting for.

1277
00:50:39,509 --> 00:50:40,943
We've only ever seen it on TV.

1278
00:50:40,943 --> 00:50:43,143
Where Park Jisung used to play...

1279
00:50:43,143 --> 00:50:45,376
It's the Old Trafford...

1280
00:50:45,376 --> 00:50:48,143
We're at the hotel right in front.

1281
00:50:48,143 --> 00:50:50,409
- There's a hotel there? / - Yes, there is.

1282
00:50:50,409 --> 00:50:52,809
- Really? / - It's for the true fans.

1283
00:50:52,809 --> 00:50:53,943
Sleep right in front.

1284
00:50:53,943 --> 00:50:56,509
That hotel must've been built for the stadium?

1285
00:50:56,509 --> 00:50:58,809
For the true fans...

1286
00:50:58,809 --> 00:51:02,209
Do you know Ryan Giggs and Gary Neville?

1287
00:51:02,209 --> 00:51:05,109
- Legends of Manchester United. / - Right.

1288
00:51:05,109 --> 00:51:07,809
They invested money to build that hotel.

1289
00:51:07,809 --> 00:51:10,609
- It must not be that old. / - Not that old.

1290
00:51:10,609 --> 00:51:12,176
- Let's go in. / - Yes.

1291
00:51:14,876 --> 00:51:16,643
How is there a hotel

1292
00:51:16,643 --> 00:51:17,643
right next to the stadium?

1293
00:51:17,643 --> 00:51:19,776
It's right next to it.

1294
00:51:19,776 --> 00:51:24,076
Don't the numbers look like the uniform numbers?

1295
00:51:24,076 --> 00:51:25,943
It's like that font.

1296
00:51:28,276 --> 00:51:31,743
Goodness. We're right in front of Old Trafford.

1297
00:51:32,709 --> 00:51:34,643
- Seriously. / - This is amazing.

1298
00:51:34,643 --> 00:51:37,043
- Wow. / - Shouldn't we take a photo of this?

1299
00:51:37,043 --> 00:51:39,043

1300
00:51:39,043 --> 00:51:41,976

1301
00:51:43,309 --> 00:51:44,743
What is this?

1302

(You can see the Old Trafford right out the window)

1303
00:51:48,676 --> 00:51:49,876
It's clean.

1304
00:51:49,876 --> 00:51:51,909
The wallpaper is like a soccer ball.

1305
00:51:51,909 --> 00:51:53,609
It's even called Hotel Football.

1306
00:51:56,009 --> 00:51:59,276
I can't believe Old Trafford is right before my eyes.

1307
00:52:00,543 --> 00:52:02,576
They gave us a very nice room.

1308
00:52:02,576 --> 00:52:04,043

1309

00:52:07,643 --> 00:52:09,009
It'd be like a shrine.

00:52:09,843 --> 00:52:12,643
I've never heard that there was a hotel there.

1312
00:52:15,643 --> 00:52:19,776
(The morning begins with the tour of Manchester)

1313
00:52:20,509 --> 00:52:24,843

A place of excitement for all EPL fans.

It was made with cutting edge technology.

1319
00:52:34,643 --> 00:52:36,576
- Let's check this place out. / - It's not bad.

1320
00:52:36,576 --> 00:52:38,276
Since we love soccer.

1321
00:52:38,876 --> 00:52:40,576
(HighMan Football Tour)

1322
00:52:40,576 --> 00:52:43,809

- It's the soccer tour today. / - Right.

1325
00:52:51,743 --> 00:52:53,776
What's the most important thing about soccer?

1326
00:52:53,776 --> 00:52:55,009
What is it?

1327
00:52:55,009 --> 00:52:56,776
- What do you think it is? Guess. / - What is it?

1328
00:52:56,776 --> 00:52:57,876
I don't know either.

1329

That's why we're at the museum today.

1330
00:53:00,543 --> 00:53:02,776
- Really? / - So let's...

1331
00:53:03,109 --> 00:53:05,543
It seems like they're welcoming us

1332
00:53:05,543 --> 00:53:07,909
with a very loud announcement.

1333
00:53:07,909 --> 00:53:10,109

- Yes. / - Goodness.

1339

The pound is expensive.

1340
00:53:21,576 --> 00:53:24,076
It's expensive so to those watching this tour...

1341
00:53:24,076 --> 00:53:26,076

00:53:29,143 --> 00:53:30,843
We're not... Are we here to have fun?

It's to have fun and...

1368
00:54:36,776 --> 00:54:38,143

He's good.

1386
00:55:31,176 --> 00:55:34,609

(I need to show them)

1393
00:55:51,676 --> 00:55:53,643
The last kick.

- I went too much for the corner. / - It's too high.

1395
00:55:57,576 --> 00:55:58,409
That's no good.

- What the? / - It registered as a goal!

1397
00:56:01,343 --> 00:56:03,643
It's worth 1,000 points.

The last kick.

1400
00:56:07,709 --> 00:56:09,443

00:56:14,243 --> 00:56:16,776
Stop talking nonsense. I heard it go out.

You heard it, right? That's a goal.

1405

- This is... / - The goalkeeper would stop that, right?

1416
00:56:46,143 --> 00:56:47,276
No way.

1417
00:56:47,276 --> 00:56:49,776
1,000 points. Nice and neat.

1418
00:56:49,776 --> 00:56:52,509
This machine makes errors.

1419
00:56:52,509 --> 00:56:53,876
Gikwang is really...

1420
00:56:53,876 --> 00:56:56,076
They're on the same team and they're fighting.

1421
00:56:57,943 --> 00:57:00,309
This time I will shoot the ball that way.

1422
00:57:00,309 --> 00:57:01,476
Give it a try.

1423
00:57:03,043 --> 00:57:04,576
That was a good shot.

1424
00:57:04,576 --> 00:57:05,443
That was a good shot. Good shot.

1425
00:57:05,443 --> 00:57:07,209
That's how you kick a ball.

1426
00:57:08,109 --> 00:57:10,809
- This is the pride of Korean soccer. / - Good work.

1427
00:57:10,809 --> 00:57:13,543
Good job. It's slow but good.

1428
00:57:13,543 --> 00:57:15,776
Of course.

1429
00:57:15,776 --> 00:57:16,576
Here goes.

1430
00:57:17,676 --> 00:57:18,709
Here goes.

1431
00:57:20,043 --> 00:57:24,609
(Will he win?)

1432
00:57:24,843 --> 00:57:26,776
(Who will win this match?)

1433
00:57:29,509 --> 00:57:31,209
- Good kick. Not bad. / - Good kick.

1434
00:57:34,043 --> 00:57:35,176
I won?

1435
00:57:36,343 --> 00:57:37,443
You win.

1436
00:57:37,443 --> 00:57:39,976
- I won? / - You win.

1437
00:57:39,976 --> 00:57:41,443
Congrats.

1438
00:57:43,009 --> 00:57:44,776
It doesn't look good right now.

1439
00:57:44,776 --> 00:57:47,309
- Only for those who like soccer. / - Look at their faces.

1440
00:57:47,309 --> 00:57:49,143
- What do you think? / - Playing for lunch.

1441
00:57:49,143 --> 00:57:51,943
The audience doesn't look happy at all.

1442
00:57:51,943 --> 00:57:53,043
This is bad.

1443
00:57:54,376 --> 00:57:55,143
(China Town)

1444
00:57:55,143 --> 00:57:57,276
(There's a restaurant that Coach Ferguson loves)

1445
00:57:57,276 --> 00:57:59,709
China Town is well developed in any city.

1446
00:57:59,709 --> 00:58:01,376
It's like a movie set.

1447
00:58:01,376 --> 00:58:06,843
(They arrive at the place full of Chinese characters)

1448
00:58:06,843 --> 00:58:08,743
(It's the China Town in Manchester)

1449
00:58:08,743 --> 00:58:11,443
As you see, we're in China Town.

1450
00:58:11,443 --> 00:58:13,009
If you look over there, you can see

1451
00:58:13,009 --> 00:58:15,609
the symbol of China Town, the Paifang.

1452
00:58:15,609 --> 00:58:19,943
It's the first Paifang built in all of Europe.

1453
00:58:19,943 --> 00:58:21,809
It's very well-preserved.

1454
00:58:21,809 --> 00:58:25,109
This China Town has a long history.

1455
00:58:25,109 --> 00:58:27,009
Why are we in China Town?

1456
00:58:27,009 --> 00:58:28,143
What do you think?

1457
00:58:28,143 --> 00:58:29,876
We're hungry, so to eat.

1458
00:58:29,876 --> 00:58:31,509
Correct!

1459
00:58:32,609 --> 00:58:35,243
There's a very famous Chinese restaurant here.

1460
00:58:35,243 --> 00:58:40,143
It's loved by Coach Ferguson and

1461
00:58:40,143 --> 00:58:41,609
other famous soccer players.

1462
00:58:41,609 --> 00:58:44,476
They're regulars here.

1463
00:58:44,476 --> 00:58:46,409
Looks delicious.

1464
00:58:46,409 --> 00:58:50,343
- I'm sure Park Jisung visited here. / - Right.

1465
00:58:50,343 --> 00:58:51,909
I dare to assume that.

1466
00:58:51,909 --> 00:58:53,409
- Let's check it out. / - Let's go.

1467
00:58:56,809 --> 00:58:59,009
As you can see, doesn't it look very traditional?

1468
00:58:59,009 --> 00:59:01,843
- It looks very traditional. / - It has a 40-year history.

1469
00:59:01,843 --> 00:59:04,809
- It's a fancy restaurant. 40 years? / - 40 years.

1470
00:59:04,809 --> 00:59:06,309
It's a Chinese restaurant.

1471
00:59:06,309 --> 00:59:09,043
I wonder where they sat.

1472
00:59:09,043 --> 00:59:11,209
- Coach Ferguson... / - The famous guests.

1473
00:59:11,209 --> 00:59:13,909
Since the bird is pointing with its beak...

1474
00:59:13,909 --> 00:59:15,243
I think that symbolizes it.

1475
00:59:15,243 --> 00:59:17,676
So this seat is where Coach Ferguson sat?

1476
00:59:17,676 --> 00:59:19,309
Where I'm seated right now...

1477
00:59:20,576 --> 00:59:23,276
Since these two are pointing to this same seat...

1478
00:59:23,276 --> 00:59:24,443
According to feng shui...

1479
00:59:24,443 --> 00:59:27,209
- This looks like the best seat. / - You're right.

1480
00:59:27,209 --> 00:59:28,676
As we're talking, what is that?

1481
00:59:28,676 --> 00:59:30,176
Thank you.

1482
00:59:30,176 --> 00:59:32,576
This is the dish Coach Ferguson loved.

1483
00:59:32,576 --> 00:59:36,876
- Lobster? / - Cantonese style lobster.

1484
00:59:36,876 --> 00:59:40,176
- It's cooked with garlic. / - Looks good.

1485
00:59:40,176 --> 00:59:42,376
That has to taste good no matter what.

1486
00:59:42,376 --> 00:59:47,143
(Cantonese style lobster, $112)

1487
00:59:51,376 --> 00:59:53,843
This is a Cantonese dish.

1488
00:59:55,609 --> 00:59:59,543
It has a familiar smell.

1489
00:59:59,543 --> 01:00:00,976
It smells very good.

1490
01:00:00,976 --> 01:00:04,243
- It reminds me of chili crab. / - Right.

1491
01:00:04,709 --> 01:00:06,343
It reminds me of that too.

1492
01:00:06,343 --> 01:00:08,109
- Then let's... / - Let's try it.

1493
01:00:08,109 --> 01:00:10,476
- I have a shellfish allergy... / - You can't eat it!

1494
01:00:11,709 --> 01:00:13,209
He can't eat then?

1495
01:00:13,209 --> 01:00:15,776
- You're allergic to shellfish? / - Yes, he is.

1496
01:00:15,776 --> 01:00:16,409
My goodness.

1497
01:00:16,409 --> 01:00:19,243
How happy would you be if your friend has that allergy?

1498
01:00:19,243 --> 01:00:22,276
Yeah, it could be annoying to share.

1499
01:00:22,276 --> 01:00:24,443
- It's lobster. / - You'll eat that all on your own?

1500
01:00:24,443 --> 01:00:26,076
Thanks.

1501
01:00:26,576 --> 01:00:28,043
Just by seeing it and smelling it...

1502
01:00:28,043 --> 01:00:30,709
- Goodness. / - It's going crazy right now.

1503
01:00:30,709 --> 01:00:32,943
The set here is so...

1504
01:00:32,943 --> 01:00:35,409
You barely eat one lobster a year.

1505
01:00:37,676 --> 01:00:39,709
Will it make Dujun show

1506
01:00:39,709 --> 01:00:42,109
a genuine smile?

1507
01:00:42,109 --> 01:00:43,309
Will it?

1508
01:00:43,309 --> 01:00:45,543
(I want to eat it too)

1509
01:00:46,909 --> 01:00:47,809
Is it delicious?

1510
01:00:48,409 --> 01:00:50,276
For real? Honestly?

1511
01:00:51,043 --> 01:00:52,543
Do you want to forget your allergy and try a bite?

1512
01:00:52,876 --> 01:00:54,909
- Is it that good? / - For real.

1513
01:00:54,909 --> 01:00:56,309
It's the best dish I've had in England.

1514
01:00:57,776 --> 01:00:59,943
The food in England sets a new record every time.

1515
01:01:01,609 --> 01:01:03,009
It's here.

1516
01:01:04,343 --> 01:01:05,576
Oh...

1517
01:01:07,543 --> 01:01:10,176
This is for the shell.

1518
01:01:12,076 --> 01:01:14,543
(So long as it isn't me)

1519
01:01:15,976 --> 01:01:17,043
Is it that good?

1520
01:01:17,843 --> 01:01:20,976
- It's... / - Does it melt in your mouth?

1521
01:01:22,143 --> 01:01:24,476
Rather than it melts in your mouth,

1522
01:01:24,476 --> 01:01:25,976
it's very plump.

1523
01:01:25,976 --> 01:01:29,243
- But it's not tough though. / - Like steamed monkfish?

1524
01:01:29,243 --> 01:01:30,543
It's just a luxurious texture.

1525
01:01:30,543 --> 01:01:31,876
When I visit Europe,

1526
01:01:31,876 --> 01:01:34,009
I always go to Chinese restaurants.

1527
01:01:34,009 --> 01:01:35,709
- It's different to the ones in Korea. / - It's different.

1528
01:01:35,709 --> 01:01:37,609
- It's very different. / - It has its charms.

1529
01:01:38,443 --> 01:01:40,309
The seasoning is made in a Chinese way.

1530
01:01:40,309 --> 01:01:42,009
It's something you can't easily find in Korea.

1531
01:01:42,009 --> 01:01:46,043
Yet, it tastes familiar. I think they made the sauce

1532
01:01:46,043 --> 01:01:48,809
using chili peppers.

1533
01:01:48,809 --> 01:01:50,876
It tastes very familiar.

1534
01:01:50,876 --> 01:01:54,043
- Korean people would love this. / - I think I got it.

1535
01:01:54,043 --> 01:01:55,976
Chinese food... Wow, it's here!

1536
01:01:55,976 --> 01:01:57,676
- What is this? / - It's Chinese steak.

1537
01:01:57,676 --> 01:01:59,209
Chinese steak.

1538
01:01:59,876 --> 01:02:02,243
- Wow. / - Chinese steak?

1539
01:02:02,243 --> 01:02:04,009
Check out the sound.

1540
01:02:07,209 --> 01:02:09,509
What is that? You can just eat it like that?

1541
01:02:09,876 --> 01:02:14,543
(Chinese steak with spring onion and ginger)

1542
01:02:15,209 --> 01:02:18,143
- It was tender like braised ribs. / - It's beef.

1543
01:02:18,143 --> 01:02:21,709
It tasted like oyster sauce or soy sauce.

1544
01:02:21,709 --> 01:02:23,409
It was a delicious salty marinade.

1545
01:02:23,409 --> 01:02:24,943
You have to eat it with rice.

1546
01:02:24,943 --> 01:02:27,209
So even in China Town...

1547
01:02:27,209 --> 01:02:29,576
- This was a famous place? / - Yes, even there.

1548
01:02:30,309 --> 01:02:32,009
- I'll have a taste. / - Can't we quickly eat it?

1549
01:02:32,909 --> 01:02:35,843
(They finally take a bite)

1550
01:02:39,209 --> 01:02:40,043
Why?

1551
01:02:40,043 --> 01:02:41,443
That face means it's really delicious.

1552
01:02:41,809 --> 01:02:43,209
(No words are needed)

1553
01:02:43,209 --> 01:02:44,876
You don't like it?

1554
01:02:44,876 --> 01:02:45,643
Oh, you want me to try it.

1555
01:02:48,109 --> 01:02:49,843
It's perfectly seasoned.

1556
01:02:50,876 --> 01:02:52,309
The meat is so tender.

1557
01:02:52,309 --> 01:02:53,109
It's seasoned very well.

1558
01:02:53,109 --> 01:02:55,009
(This restaurant serves nice steak)

1559
01:02:55,009 --> 01:02:55,843
It's delicious.

1560
01:02:55,843 --> 01:02:58,009
This is the best restaurant in England.

1561
01:02:58,876 --> 01:03:00,476
- This is the place. / - This is it.

1562
01:03:00,476 --> 01:03:01,943
It's not like steak actually.

1563
01:03:01,943 --> 01:03:04,376
It's tender like braised pork ribs.

1564
01:03:04,376 --> 01:03:06,676
The sauce is savory and sweet.

1565
01:03:06,676 --> 01:03:11,176
- It's well seasoned. / - It feels like bulgogi too.

1566
01:03:11,176 --> 01:03:13,543
Whoever tastes it will

1567
01:03:13,543 --> 01:03:14,709
be able to enjoy it.

1568
01:03:15,376 --> 01:03:17,909
It's so good. I'm really happy.

1569
01:03:17,909 --> 01:03:19,876
Wow, this is so delicious.

1570
01:03:22,343 --> 01:03:23,276
What is this?

1571
01:03:24,043 --> 01:03:27,309
It's egg fried rice!

1572
01:03:27,609 --> 01:03:29,976
(He overdid it)

1573
01:03:29,976 --> 01:03:30,909
That's funny.

1574
01:03:32,676 --> 01:03:35,643
I can't believe how luxurious this lunch is.

1575
01:03:36,243 --> 01:03:37,643
I'm crying tears of joy.

1576
01:03:38,509 --> 01:03:39,909
It's really delicious.

1577
01:03:39,909 --> 01:03:42,776
- You can eat that rice with meat. / - The sauce...

1578
01:03:42,776 --> 01:03:45,509
- Mix it together. / - It'd be so good with the sauce.

1579
01:03:45,509 --> 01:03:47,543
He's eating that lobster alone.

1580
01:03:50,576 --> 01:03:53,043
Since English people come here,

1581
01:03:53,043 --> 01:03:55,443
I can see that they put in an effort

1582
01:03:55,443 --> 01:03:58,009
to cater for their tastes.

1583
01:03:58,009 --> 01:04:01,709
It's a slightly salty flavor.

1584
01:04:01,709 --> 01:04:03,143
But it's not too strong.

1585
01:04:03,143 --> 01:04:05,076
Compared to other Chinese cooking.

1586
01:04:05,076 --> 01:04:06,709
I think this might be the best day of my life.

1587
01:04:06,709 --> 01:04:08,809
- Having this great food. / - Yes, great food.

1588
01:04:08,809 --> 01:04:11,343
- And watching a historic game. / - Historic.

1589
01:04:12,843 --> 01:04:17,243
(Finally, the highlight of Manchester)

1590
01:04:18,443 --> 01:04:20,543
- Is it finally time? / - Finally.

1591
01:04:20,543 --> 01:04:21,509
Finally the highlight.

1592
01:04:21,509 --> 01:04:24,609
I've been hosting Battle Trip for 2 years,

1593
01:04:24,609 --> 01:04:27,743
I've never seen the audience this quiet before.

1594
01:04:27,743 --> 01:04:29,909
Because it's their first time

1595
01:04:29,909 --> 01:04:31,309
witnessing Manchester derby in 2 years.

1596
01:04:31,309 --> 01:04:33,576
You may not be able to relate.

1597
01:04:33,576 --> 01:04:36,276
But watching a Manchester United match

1598
01:04:36,276 --> 01:04:43,043
is the no. 1 thing on their bucket list

1599
01:04:43,043 --> 01:04:44,009
for true soccer fans.

1600
01:04:44,376 --> 01:04:46,743
It's like a Highlight fan listening to their album

1601
01:04:46,743 --> 01:04:48,643
and then going to their concert for the first time.

1602
01:04:48,643 --> 01:04:50,409
- Right. / - That's how it feels.

1603
01:04:50,409 --> 01:04:52,409
I think I understand.

1604
01:04:53,809 --> 01:04:59,009
(They will go to the stadium by the tram)

1605
01:04:59,976 --> 01:05:03,043
The tram we will take is coming in.

1606
01:05:04,509 --> 01:05:09,043
(20 minutes by tram)

1607
01:05:09,276 --> 01:05:12,676
Riding in a tram like this...

1608
01:05:13,476 --> 01:05:15,776
It's nice. We can enjoy the scenery as well.

1609
01:05:16,576 --> 01:05:18,609
The view outside is beautiful.

1610
01:05:20,343 --> 01:05:23,743
- It's slow but it feels nice. / - Yes, it's a nice vibe.

1611
01:05:24,209 --> 01:05:26,309
We could use it.

1612
01:05:26,309 --> 01:05:28,576
A shot outside the tram.

1613
01:05:29,043 --> 01:05:30,843
The viewpoint is too high.

1614
01:05:30,843 --> 01:05:32,009
You're right.

1615
01:05:33,443 --> 01:05:34,476
This is precise, right?

1616
01:05:37,009 --> 01:05:39,643
(This is the right viewing height)

1617
01:05:39,643 --> 01:05:40,509
(You can see his eye)

1618
01:05:40,509 --> 01:05:41,909
This is the viewpoint.

1619
01:05:44,143 --> 01:05:45,476
Let's go with VR.

1620
01:05:46,376 --> 01:05:47,343
VR.

1621
01:05:48,909 --> 01:05:50,143
(This is what they're actually doing)

1622
01:05:50,143 --> 01:05:51,843
Big eyes.

1623
01:05:52,343 --> 01:05:53,009
It's nice.

1624
01:05:53,676 --> 01:05:58,143
(They arrived after 20 minutes)

1625
01:06:02,776 --> 01:06:05,243
I saw that on the news.

1626
01:06:05,909 --> 01:06:07,876
How many hours is that before kick off?

1627
01:06:07,876 --> 01:06:10,643
- 3 hours before. / - 3 hours?

1628
01:06:12,743 --> 01:06:14,676
(So different to when they left the hotel)

1629
01:06:16,909 --> 01:06:20,109
The crowd is going wild here.

1630
01:06:20,109 --> 01:06:23,243
- It's so... / - It's going off and we're right in the middle.

1631
01:06:23,243 --> 01:06:26,043
When we stayed at that hotel,

1632
01:06:26,043 --> 01:06:28,076
we didn't think so many people would gather

1633
01:06:28,076 --> 01:06:29,443
at the plaza like this.

1634
01:06:29,443 --> 01:06:30,843
If you take a look...

1635
01:06:30,843 --> 01:06:33,109
- It's 3 hours before the match right now. / - Right.

1636
01:06:33,109 --> 01:06:36,143
But all these people here show how passionate it is.

1637
01:06:36,143 --> 01:06:37,776
Even now my heart...

1638
01:06:37,776 --> 01:06:39,976
- It's starting to race. / - Is it?

1639
01:06:39,976 --> 01:06:43,876
This is the most historical moment of my life.

1640
01:06:43,876 --> 01:06:46,876
- The security is intense. / - That's right.

1641
01:06:46,876 --> 01:06:49,509
Let's head in as we hope

1642
01:06:49,509 --> 01:06:51,443
that the players will have a safe match.

1643
01:06:51,443 --> 01:06:52,843
Let's go.

1644
01:06:56,709 --> 01:06:59,109
I can't believe this.

1645
01:06:59,776 --> 01:07:02,109
Old Trafford can seat

1646
01:07:02,109 --> 01:07:05,009
around 75,000 as far as I know.

1647
01:07:05,009 --> 01:07:05,743
I really want to go there.

1648
01:07:05,743 --> 01:07:08,376
- If it's 75,000... / - It's incredibly large.

1649
01:07:09,576 --> 01:07:12,309
This makes no sense.

1650
01:07:13,443 --> 01:07:16,409
This is Old Trafford.

1651
01:07:16,409 --> 01:07:18,543
We're heading in.

1652
01:07:18,643 --> 01:07:21,909
(They can't help but exclaim)

1653
01:07:22,743 --> 01:07:24,376
It's like art.

1654
01:07:25,276 --> 01:07:27,176
I really can't believe this.

1655
01:07:27,476 --> 01:07:29,209
I'm getting goose bumps.

1656
01:07:29,209 --> 01:07:31,309
- That's amazing. / - I'm getting goose bumps too.

1657
01:07:31,309 --> 01:07:33,309
- You have to see it in person. / - Of course.

1658
01:07:33,309 --> 01:07:34,743
If you like soccer, you'd love it.

1659
01:07:34,743 --> 01:07:36,276
This is ridiculous.

1660
01:07:39,076 --> 01:07:43,543
(It's almost game time, the players are warming up)

1661
01:07:45,943 --> 01:07:47,509
Unbelievable. No way.

1662
01:07:48,043 --> 01:07:52,143
(The players are right in front of their eyes)

1663
01:07:52,143 --> 01:07:54,609
Have you seen a Korean soccer stadium?

1664
01:07:54,609 --> 01:07:57,076
- There's a running track around the field. / - It's far.

1665
01:07:57,076 --> 01:08:00,143
You're far from the field. That's a soccer only stadium.

1666
01:08:00,143 --> 01:08:01,776
The seats are right behind the goals.

1667
01:08:01,776 --> 01:08:03,643
You're right. It's right in front.

1668
01:08:05,443 --> 01:08:06,876
Unbelievable. No way.

1669
01:08:07,343 --> 01:08:13,009
(The players are right in front of their eyes)

1670
01:08:13,009 --> 01:08:14,976
No way!

1671
01:08:14,976 --> 01:08:17,476
(Gikwang can't close his mouth)

1672
01:08:19,476 --> 01:08:22,109
This is my happiest moment of 2017.

1673
01:08:22,109 --> 01:08:24,843
As a person who loves soccer,

1674
01:08:24,843 --> 01:08:27,509
I can't believe that such a glorious day would come.

1675
01:08:28,043 --> 01:08:29,476
(However)

1676
01:08:29,476 --> 01:08:31,076
What's wrong? No, no.

1677
01:08:32,643 --> 01:08:33,709
Snow, snow.

1678
01:08:33,709 --> 01:08:35,643
- Since it's winter. / - Why is it snowing so much?

1679
01:08:38,443 --> 01:08:40,676
(Serious)

1680
01:08:43,009 --> 01:08:47,376
(Fortunately, the weather got better so the game began)

1681
01:08:47,376 --> 01:08:48,509
Amazing.

1682
01:08:51,076 --> 01:08:53,043
Here we go.

1683
01:08:54,176 --> 01:08:58,009
I've always only heard this sound on TV.

1684
01:08:58,009 --> 01:08:59,676
I never thought I'd hear it in person.

1685
01:09:03,209 --> 01:09:04,809
(We apologize that due to copyright laws)

1686
01:09:04,809 --> 01:09:06,609
(We cannot show any footage of the soccer match)

1687
01:09:06,609 --> 01:09:08,043
(Please enjoy the match through idol reactions)

1688
01:09:08,943 --> 01:09:11,043
- Reactions. / - Reactions...

1689
01:09:11,643 --> 01:09:13,643
(Manchester City is about to score)

1690
01:09:13,643 --> 01:09:15,676
(Manchester United player is tackled)

1691
01:09:16,076 --> 01:09:17,076
(They miss the ball)

1692
01:09:17,809 --> 01:09:20,176
(They get close to the goal)

1693
01:09:20,176 --> 01:09:21,976
(This isn't copy and paste)

1694
01:09:22,443 --> 01:09:24,376
(They look like meerkats)

1695
01:09:27,076 --> 01:09:28,743
- What happened? / - They must've scored.

1696
01:09:29,243 --> 01:09:30,843
Manchester is really quiet.

1697
01:09:31,643 --> 01:09:32,909
It doesn't look good.

1698
01:09:32,909 --> 01:09:35,009
The viewers can't see well.

1699
01:09:35,009 --> 01:09:37,309
On TV, they show replays.

1700
01:09:37,309 --> 01:09:39,543
- I saw it. / - I missed it.

1701
01:09:40,809 --> 01:09:50,309
(Manchester United continues to make mistakes)

1702
01:09:50,776 --> 01:09:52,176
That man behind doesn't look happy.

1703
01:09:52,176 --> 01:09:54,276
(Wow)

1704
01:09:54,976 --> 01:09:56,743
They must've scored.

1705
01:09:56,743 --> 01:09:58,543
They scored.

1706
01:09:58,543 --> 01:10:01,209
The first half just ended.

1707
01:10:01,209 --> 01:10:03,409
It's really hot in here.

1708
01:10:03,409 --> 01:10:04,576
- Beyond expectations. / - That's right.

1709
01:10:04,576 --> 01:10:06,276
They're playing really well.

1710
01:10:06,809 --> 01:10:07,943
- Seriously. / - It's a lot of fun.

1711
01:10:07,943 --> 01:10:09,643
I'm expecting more for the second half.

1712
01:10:09,643 --> 01:10:14,843
(They seem to be very excited)

1713
01:10:15,609 --> 01:10:21,343
(The lively and captivating match continues)

1714
01:10:23,543 --> 01:10:25,476
(Just then)

1715
01:10:25,476 --> 01:10:26,576
They score again.

1716
01:10:26,576 --> 01:10:28,509
- How was it? Are they good? / - You can tell.

1717
01:10:28,509 --> 01:10:30,443
They were incredible.

1718
01:10:31,309 --> 01:10:36,343
(Manchester City wins by 2:1)

1719
01:10:37,509 --> 01:10:40,976
(Historic moment, is this for real?)

1720
01:10:41,576 --> 01:10:42,843
How good must it have been?

1721
01:10:44,376 --> 01:10:46,709
(After the soccer match)

1722
01:10:47,243 --> 01:10:50,876
The sense of realism was amazing.

1723
01:10:50,876 --> 01:10:52,943
Manchester City set a new record.

1724
01:10:52,943 --> 01:10:56,343
The first time they've had 14 consecutive wins.

1725
01:10:56,343 --> 01:10:58,576
- We were part of that historic moment. / - Right.

1726
01:10:58,576 --> 01:10:59,343
That was very meaningful.

1727
01:10:59,343 --> 01:11:02,143
My excitement hasn't calmed down yet.

1728
01:11:02,143 --> 01:11:04,909
- Let's continue the talk over a beer. / - Sounds good.

1729
01:11:04,909 --> 01:11:06,576
We can't calm down our excitement right now.

1730
01:11:06,576 --> 01:11:08,843
- We must visit an English pub. / - That's right.

1731
01:11:08,843 --> 01:11:11,776
- Let's enjoy it. Let's go. / - Let's go.

1732
01:11:15,376 --> 01:11:19,976
(It's already the last night of the trip)

1733
01:11:21,743 --> 01:11:24,776
It's a traditional English pub.

1734
01:11:24,776 --> 01:11:28,176
There are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 monitors...

1735
01:11:28,176 --> 01:11:29,409
It's amazing.

1736
01:11:29,409 --> 01:11:32,143
- Every monitor is playing soccer. / - I love it.

1737
01:11:32,143 --> 01:11:35,176
There are lots of sports pubs in England.

1738
01:11:35,176 --> 01:11:37,076
- That's right. / - What a sports pub is...

1739
01:11:37,076 --> 01:11:39,609
- Those who couldn't get tickets... / - They gather.

1740
01:11:39,609 --> 01:11:42,476
They drink there as if they're at the match.

1741
01:11:43,209 --> 01:11:44,909
Great work today.

1742
01:11:44,909 --> 01:11:47,409
The symbol of England.

1743
01:11:47,409 --> 01:11:49,376
- Let's end the tour... / - With ale.

1744
01:11:49,376 --> 01:11:51,376
With a glass of beer.

1745
01:11:51,376 --> 01:11:53,043
- There are so many monitors. / - HighMan Tour!

1746
01:11:53,043 --> 01:11:55,609
- I feel like beer now. / - Oh, beer...

1747
01:11:55,609 --> 01:11:57,643
It might be more fun to watch...

1748
01:11:57,643 --> 01:12:00,076
- The game here and drink beer. / - That's right.

1749
01:12:03,843 --> 01:12:08,476
Dark beer usually is less carbonated...

1750
01:12:08,476 --> 01:12:10,709
- Than other beers. / - Right.

1751
01:12:10,709 --> 01:12:13,143
This isn't carbonated at all.

1752
01:12:13,143 --> 01:12:14,209
Try some.

1753
01:12:14,209 --> 01:12:18,143
There are a lot of people who can't drink

1754
01:12:18,143 --> 01:12:19,543
carbonated beverages.

1755
01:12:19,543 --> 01:12:22,376
This is good for those people.

1756
01:12:22,376 --> 01:12:23,776
I thought it would be similar

1757
01:12:23,776 --> 01:12:26,776
to the "G" brand beer.

1758
01:12:26,776 --> 01:12:29,476
- It's good. Nice and smooth. / - It's really tasty.

1759
01:12:30,976 --> 01:12:33,276
We'll drink more next time.

1760
01:12:33,276 --> 01:12:35,643
In England, even if you watch on TV,

1761
01:12:35,643 --> 01:12:36,209
the money...

1762
01:12:36,209 --> 01:12:39,476
- Since it's not a free channel. / - Really?

1763
01:12:39,476 --> 01:12:41,643
It's the first time I've watched EPL in person.

1764
01:12:41,643 --> 01:12:44,343
This was something I only dreamed of.

1765
01:12:44,643 --> 01:12:47,609
I watched these games at home...

1766
01:12:47,609 --> 01:12:49,576
- While sleeping. / - Right.

1767
01:12:49,576 --> 01:12:53,509
We actually saw this with our own eyes.

1768
01:12:53,509 --> 01:12:55,709
I was so happy to see the players 20m in front of us.

1769
01:12:56,276 --> 01:12:58,509
- It was a dream come true for them. / - That's right.

1770
01:12:58,509 --> 01:13:00,209
That's one tick off the bucket list.

1771
01:13:00,209 --> 01:13:03,843
Let's pick the best moment of this England trip.

1772
01:13:03,843 --> 01:13:08,043
I wanted to try skydiving once before I die.

1773
01:13:08,043 --> 01:13:10,976
I think it was really nice to experience

1774
01:13:10,976 --> 01:13:13,109
indoor skydiving.

1775
01:13:13,109 --> 01:13:15,376
It felt like I was riding a strong wind

1776
01:13:15,376 --> 01:13:18,609
for those short 2 minutes.

1777
01:13:18,609 --> 01:13:19,909
- It felt like flying. / - Exactly.

1778
01:13:19,909 --> 01:13:23,043
I'll never try skydiving for the rest of my life.

1779
01:13:23,043 --> 01:13:24,709
I'll never do it.

1780
01:13:24,709 --> 01:13:28,643
But all my curiosity about skydiving

1781
01:13:28,643 --> 01:13:30,076
is completely satisfied.

1782
01:13:30,076 --> 01:13:33,043
I don't need to try skydiving ever again.

1783
01:13:33,043 --> 01:13:35,509
I think that's a good thing

1784
01:13:35,509 --> 01:13:37,343
about the indoor skydiving.

1785
01:13:37,343 --> 01:13:42,409
And I liked the whole view of the Lake District.

1786
01:13:42,409 --> 01:13:44,176
It was the best moment for me.

1787
01:13:44,176 --> 01:13:45,609
I'm sad that we couldn't get the whole thing

1788
01:13:45,609 --> 01:13:46,176
on camera.

1789
01:13:46,176 --> 01:13:47,243
It's such a shame.

1790
01:13:47,243 --> 01:13:51,076
Because it was a 360-degree surround view.

1791
01:13:51,076 --> 01:13:54,043
The camera can't capture the beauty of the sky

1792
01:13:54,043 --> 01:13:55,976
but it can capture the beauty of beer.

1793
01:13:55,976 --> 01:13:57,243
It's really strange.

1794
01:13:58,243 --> 01:14:00,609
I liked the poem I read up there.

1795
01:14:00,609 --> 01:14:02,509
- I liked the process of going up. / - Right.

1796
01:14:02,509 --> 01:14:05,376
Just like the view, it opened up my heart.

1797
01:14:05,376 --> 01:14:09,509
It was the best moment. That magnificent view.

1798
01:14:11,143 --> 01:14:14,976
I hope HighMan Tour will win this battle.

1799
01:14:14,976 --> 01:14:18,309
- For a successful finish. / - I want my third win.

1800
01:14:18,776 --> 01:14:20,009
Great work.

1801
01:14:21,743 --> 01:14:23,376
HighMan Tour!

1802
01:14:23,376 --> 01:14:24,576
Where are you looking?

1803
01:14:24,576 --> 01:14:26,276
HighMan Tour!

1804
01:14:28,709 --> 01:14:33,443
(HighMan Tour, the end)

1805
01:14:36,776 --> 01:14:39,609
I always say that

1806
01:14:39,609 --> 01:14:41,476
I want to go on a trip with a girlfriend.

1807
01:14:41,476 --> 01:14:44,443
But this trip was good enough to go with a friend.

1808
01:14:44,443 --> 01:14:46,509
It's good that they went there together.

1809
01:14:46,509 --> 01:14:49,443
Gikwang and I are the two members

1810
01:14:49,443 --> 01:14:50,609
who love soccer in our group.

1811
01:14:50,609 --> 01:14:51,876
- You love sports. / - Yes.

1812
01:14:51,876 --> 01:14:55,209
So how did it feel to have the players right before you.

1813
01:14:55,209 --> 01:14:57,176
It still feels like...

1814
01:14:57,176 --> 01:14:58,643
- Your heart races? / - I was dreaming.

1815
01:14:58,643 --> 01:15:00,643
I think you'd be more nervous

1816
01:15:00,643 --> 01:15:02,943
3 hours before the match when...

1817
01:15:02,943 --> 01:15:04,509
- The people start to gather. / - Right.

1818
01:15:04,509 --> 01:15:06,376
Please tell us how it felt then.

1819
01:15:06,376 --> 01:15:07,776
When we have a concert,

1820
01:15:07,776 --> 01:15:10,309
our fans wait for several hours there.

1821
01:15:10,309 --> 01:15:12,876
It felt like we could experience

1822
01:15:12,876 --> 01:15:14,643
the same thing indirectly.

1823
01:15:14,643 --> 01:15:17,743
Above all things, I was honored

1824
01:15:17,743 --> 01:15:21,009
to watch the best soccer teams play

1825
01:15:21,009 --> 01:15:22,676
in the best league. As a fan of soccer...

1826
01:15:22,676 --> 01:15:24,143
- That's just... / - I understand.

1827
01:15:24,143 --> 01:15:26,476
Now, it's time to check their traveling expenses

1828
01:15:26,476 --> 01:15:27,643
excluding the airfares.

1829
01:15:27,643 --> 01:15:29,543
- How much did you spend? / - Dujun.

1830
01:15:29,543 --> 01:15:30,843
Excluding airfares,

1831
01:15:30,843 --> 01:15:35,109
during the 3 days, HighMan Tour in England spent...

1832
01:15:35,109 --> 01:15:36,976
- Per person... / - How much?

1833
01:15:36,976 --> 01:15:38,509
It's quite costly over there.

1834
01:15:38,943 --> 01:15:41,109
$660.90.

1835
01:15:43,643 --> 01:15:44,776
$660?

1836
01:15:44,776 --> 01:15:46,843
It's cheaper than what you expected, right?

1837
01:15:46,843 --> 01:15:48,609
That's because the museums are free.

1838
01:15:48,609 --> 01:15:51,709
- Since they're public. / - The judges are stirred up.

1839
01:15:51,709 --> 01:15:54,343
Let's cast the final vote.

1840
01:15:54,343 --> 01:15:55,776
This is my third time to be here.

1841
01:15:55,776 --> 01:15:58,443
The audience looks more displeased...

1842
01:15:58,443 --> 01:16:01,509
- Than ever. / - No, we can still win.

1843
01:16:01,509 --> 01:16:03,576
It's because they were too focused.

1844
01:16:03,576 --> 01:16:04,809
Dujun must have a feeling...

1845
01:16:04,809 --> 01:16:07,309
If the other team went to France or Italy, then I'd worry

1846
01:16:07,309 --> 01:16:09,643
but they went to England as well.

1847
01:16:09,643 --> 01:16:11,143
- You never know. / - Right.

1848
01:16:11,143 --> 01:16:12,476
Just how much better could it be?

1849
01:16:12,476 --> 01:16:14,343
Or how much worse?

1850
01:16:14,343 --> 01:16:17,643
- Please be understanding. / - What's in Liverpool?

1851
01:16:17,643 --> 01:16:20,176
I believe it'd be good to visit at least once.

1852
01:16:20,176 --> 01:16:22,609
If you end up going,

1853
01:16:22,609 --> 01:16:24,509
I hope our plan helps even just a little bit.

1854
01:16:24,509 --> 01:16:25,576
Are you ready?

1855
01:16:25,576 --> 01:16:29,476
Will you go on a trip to Manchester according to

1856
01:16:29,476 --> 01:16:31,443
the HighMan Tour? Yes or no?

1857
01:16:31,443 --> 01:16:33,676
Please vote!

1858
01:16:34,643 --> 01:16:36,876
(HighMan Tour showed the best trip for soccer fans)

1859
01:16:36,876 --> 01:16:39,576
(What will the judges choose?)

1860
01:16:39,776 --> 01:16:41,743
We went to Manchester today.

1861
01:16:41,743 --> 01:16:44,509
- And we'll go to Liverpool next week. / - Yes.

1862
01:16:44,509 --> 01:16:46,409
Are you confident? You guys look so tired.

1863
01:16:46,409 --> 01:16:48,576
If we knew the audience would respond like this...

1864
01:16:48,576 --> 01:16:50,743
- We should've gone first. / - Why?

1865
01:16:50,743 --> 01:16:53,176
To change this mood...

1866
01:16:53,176 --> 01:16:56,109
We need a considerable amount of energy.

1867
01:16:56,109 --> 01:16:58,509
However...

1868
01:16:58,509 --> 01:17:01,176
When I went to London,

1869
01:17:01,176 --> 01:17:04,509
I didn't see a reason to fly for 12 hours to get there.

1870
01:17:04,509 --> 01:17:07,609
But when I went to Liverpool, I was glad that I went.

1871
01:17:07,609 --> 01:17:09,176
We always think that too.

1872
01:17:09,176 --> 01:17:11,109
He said something hopeful for the first time.

1873
01:17:11,109 --> 01:17:12,409
- Next week, you'll see... / - You'll see.

1874
01:17:12,409 --> 01:17:15,176
We will leave for the romantic city, Liverpool.

1875
01:17:15,176 --> 01:17:16,309
Please join us again next week.

1876
01:17:16,309 --> 01:17:18,043
Thank you.

1877
01:17:21,149 --> 01:17:22,049
(Next episode)

1878
01:17:22,482 --> 01:17:24,449
So this is what England is like.

1879
01:17:25,515 --> 01:17:26,649
It's great.

1880
01:17:27,015 --> 01:17:28,982
This is totally me.

1881
01:17:29,549 --> 01:17:31,115
There's something new.

1882
01:17:34,582 --> 01:17:36,682
Liverpool is cool.

1883
01:17:36,682 --> 01:17:38,582
Finally, The Beatles...

1884
01:17:38,582 --> 01:17:40,482
It's love for The Beatles.

1885
01:17:40,482 --> 01:17:41,649
So cool.

1886
01:17:42,215 --> 01:17:43,315
I feel emotional.

1887
01:17:45,915 --> 01:17:47,749
