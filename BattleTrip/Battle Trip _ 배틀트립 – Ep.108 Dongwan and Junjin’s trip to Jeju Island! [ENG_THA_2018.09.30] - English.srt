(Numerous great tips on trips)

00:00:05,074 --> 00:00:06,540
(Kim Sook, Sung Sikyung) 

3
00:00:07,074 --> 00:00:08,707
(Lee Hwijae, special host, Dayoung of WJSN) 

4
00:00:09,407 --> 00:00:11,607
- Gosh, that's... / - Travel is war. 

5
00:00:11,607 --> 00:00:13,740
Battle Trip! 

6
00:00:15,674 --> 00:00:17,607
- Wait. / - Are you pretending... 

7
00:00:17,607 --> 00:00:19,240
- To be close like that? / - Pretending to be close. 

8
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:20,774
Today's special host is... 

9
00:00:20,774 --> 00:00:23,407
- Dayoung of WJSN. / - Welcome. 

10
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:26,307
Dayoung. 

11
00:00:26,307 --> 00:00:27,374
How old are you? 

12
00:00:27,374 --> 00:00:29,840
I turned 20 this year. 

13
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:31,107
Congratulations. 

14
00:00:31,107 --> 00:00:34,440
So, I want to learn a lot with this show today. 

15
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:36,007
You're such a smooth talker. 

16
00:00:36,007 --> 00:00:37,807
I'm glad you're here today. 

17
00:00:37,807 --> 00:00:40,540
People say Battle Trip is good for beginners. 

18
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:42,507
To be honest, I've never been on a trip 

19
00:00:42,507 --> 00:00:44,540
since elementary school. 

20
00:00:44,674 --> 00:00:46,174
I was a trainee for a long time, 

21
00:00:46,174 --> 00:00:47,507
so I didn't even go on school trips... 

22
00:00:47,507 --> 00:00:49,607
- Or school retreats. / - Oh, no. 

23
00:00:49,607 --> 00:00:52,174
So I really want to go on a trip. 

24
00:00:52,174 --> 00:00:53,874
- It's my dream. / - Where do you want to go? 

25
00:00:53,874 --> 00:00:56,007
I actually wrote them down. 

26
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:59,240
- It's full of your notes. / - That's a lot. 

27
00:00:59,374 --> 00:01:00,874
I want to go to... 

28
00:01:00,874 --> 00:01:03,607
- Singapore, Boracay. / - Singapore and Boracay? 

29
00:01:03,607 --> 00:01:07,040
Kota Kinabalu in Malaysia and Laos. 

30
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,674
Laos? I see. 

31
00:01:08,674 --> 00:01:10,674
- Mainly vacation spots. / - Hey, go away. 

32
00:01:10,874 --> 00:01:12,240
You will go to all of those places. 

33
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:13,774
I hope she will go there soon. 

34
00:01:13,774 --> 00:01:15,540
Let's find out today's theme then. 

35
00:01:15,874 --> 00:01:17,174
(Plans for domestic trips in the second half of 2018?) 

36
00:01:17,174 --> 00:01:18,807
Plans for domestic trips in the second half of 2018. 

37
00:01:19,707 --> 00:01:21,440
I bet everyone has plans to go. 

38
00:01:22,474 --> 00:01:24,307
(Most preferred travel destination in the country) 

39
00:01:24,307 --> 00:01:25,774
What is the most preferred place? Gyeongsang-do? 

40
00:01:25,774 --> 00:01:26,974
- Gangwon-do. / - That's 3rd. 

41
00:01:26,974 --> 00:01:29,307
- The 1st place is... / - It's Jeju-do. 

42
00:01:29,474 --> 00:01:31,807
With 37%. That's a lot. 

43
00:01:31,807 --> 00:01:34,340
- Everyone wants to go there. / - It's our treasure. 

44
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:35,474
It's beautiful. 

45
00:01:36,907 --> 00:01:39,240
The 2018 newest edition of Jeju-do. 

46
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:41,507
- The newest edition? / - Even travel guides... 

47
00:01:41,507 --> 00:01:43,940
- Yes. / - There's a newest edition every year. 

48
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:45,640
- We can't use the old one. / - Actually... 

49
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:48,340
It's important to have the newest edition for Jeju-do. 

50
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:50,540
- It keeps changing. / - It just changes... 

51
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:52,207
- Every day. / - She's right. 

52
00:01:52,207 --> 00:01:54,474
In fact, I wondered why Dayoung was here. 

53
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:56,740
- It turns out... / - Dayoung is here because... 

54
00:01:57,140 --> 00:01:57,740
That's right. 

55
00:01:57,740 --> 00:02:00,640
I'm the daughter of Jeju-do. 

56
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,407
I used to live in Jeju-do, 

57
00:02:02,407 --> 00:02:04,040
and I was born... 

58
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:06,340
- On Chujado near Jeju-do. / - You were? 

59
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:08,007
- Really? / - Yes. 

60
00:02:08,007 --> 00:02:09,040
That's right. 

61
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:10,940
I can't believe this. 

62
00:02:11,307 --> 00:02:13,474
To be honest, 

63
00:02:13,474 --> 00:02:15,707
a lot of people know Jeju-do, 

64
00:02:15,707 --> 00:02:18,674
but many don't know about Chujado. 

65
00:02:18,674 --> 00:02:19,974
I've heard of it before. 

66
00:02:19,974 --> 00:02:21,374
It's a good place for fishing. 

67
00:02:21,374 --> 00:02:22,540
It's a beautiful island. 

68
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:24,174
When did you go to Jeju-do? 

69
00:02:24,174 --> 00:02:25,274
When was your latest visit? 

70
00:02:25,274 --> 00:02:28,174
I went there on Chuseok last year. 

71
00:02:28,174 --> 00:02:29,674
You didn't go there in 2018, right? 

72
00:02:29,674 --> 00:02:31,474
- That's right. / - Then this episode would help. 

73
00:02:31,474 --> 00:02:34,874
So I actually miss Jeju-do a lot now. 

74
00:02:35,207 --> 00:02:37,574
So I want to ease the homesickness here today. 

75
00:02:37,574 --> 00:02:38,840
- That sounds nice. / - Alright. 

76
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:40,640
The 2018 newest edition of Jeju-do. 

77
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:43,340
I wonder who went to where. 

78
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:46,140
Here are today's trip planners. 

79
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:48,007
(Who are today's trip planners?) 

80
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,407
(JR and Baekho of NU'EST W) 

81
00:02:52,407 --> 00:02:53,574
We're going to win. 

82
00:02:53,874 --> 00:02:55,707
(Jun Jin and Kim Dongwan of SHINHWA) 

83
00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:57,607
Both teams are so cool. 

84
00:02:57,607 --> 00:02:59,974
Idol artists don't seem to get old. 

85
00:02:59,974 --> 00:03:03,174
You know how people say like husband, like wife. 

86
00:03:03,174 --> 00:03:04,774
They've been together for 20 years already. 

87
00:03:04,774 --> 00:03:07,274
Did you have the same travel style? 

88
00:03:07,274 --> 00:03:08,740
In fact, 

89
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:11,307
Jun Jin likes to have a slow and relaxing trip. 

90
00:03:11,307 --> 00:03:13,274
- But I... / - I want to enjoy trips at leisure. 

91
00:03:13,274 --> 00:03:14,407
But Dongwan... 

92
00:03:14,407 --> 00:03:16,407
- Likes to travel to many places. / - He moves around. 

93
00:03:16,407 --> 00:03:18,174
- I want to visit popular places. / - I know. 

94
00:03:18,174 --> 00:03:20,407
Whether I'm popular or not. 

95
00:03:21,107 --> 00:03:23,474
When JR was here as a special host, 

96
00:03:23,474 --> 00:03:25,107
he said he wanted to go on a trip with Baekho. 

97
00:03:25,107 --> 00:03:26,340
That's right. 

98
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:28,107
Who do you want to go on a trip with? 

99
00:03:28,374 --> 00:03:30,274
- Baekho. / - Baekho? 

100
00:03:30,274 --> 00:03:34,407
He has a big build. I feel like he can protect me. 

101
00:03:34,407 --> 00:03:35,507
Wait... 

102
00:03:35,507 --> 00:03:36,640
Are you from Jeju-do? 

103
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:37,840
- Yes, I'm from Jeju-do. / - Really? 

104
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,740
- We've won this. / - We're going to win. 

105
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:41,907
- He's from Jeju-do. / - I'm from... 

106
00:03:41,907 --> 00:03:43,774
Aewol in Jeju-do. 

107
00:03:44,974 --> 00:03:46,374
The locals visit places 

108
00:03:46,374 --> 00:03:48,807
that only the locals know. 

109
00:03:48,807 --> 00:03:50,607
The important thing is 

110
00:03:50,607 --> 00:03:53,940
Baekho is nicknamed Aewol Prince. 

111
00:03:55,074 --> 00:03:56,574
- AP? / - Yes, he's AP. 

112
00:03:56,574 --> 00:03:58,040
He's the Aewol Prince. 

113
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:01,207
A lot of people like to travel to Jeju-do. 

114
00:04:01,207 --> 00:04:03,674
I often recommend good places to people. 

115
00:04:03,674 --> 00:04:05,074
- So... / - When you recommend them... 

116
00:04:05,074 --> 00:04:06,607
Do they actually like the places? 

117
00:04:06,607 --> 00:04:08,974
- I think so. / - That's it then. 

118
00:04:08,974 --> 00:04:10,140
- Baekho. / - Yes. 

119
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:11,474
How long did you live there? 

120
00:04:11,474 --> 00:04:13,707
- I lived there until junior high. / - I see. 

121
00:04:13,707 --> 00:04:15,840
When was your latest visit? 

122
00:04:16,274 --> 00:04:17,474
I go there very often. 

123
00:04:17,474 --> 00:04:20,307
I guess it's about once a month. 

124
00:04:20,307 --> 00:04:22,440
- That's powerful. / - And he has his family there. 

125
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:25,340
We're very confident about this trip. 

126
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:27,407
They have an amazing team name. 

127
00:04:27,407 --> 00:04:28,407
- Yes. / - What is it? 

128
00:04:28,407 --> 00:04:30,074
- Our team name is... / - Yes. 

129
00:04:30,074 --> 00:04:31,607
Baekho Tour. 

130
00:04:32,807 --> 00:04:34,340
Unless it's called Blue Dragon Tour, 

131
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:35,707
you have no chance. 

132
00:04:35,707 --> 00:04:38,140
What a dad joke. 

133
00:04:38,307 --> 00:04:40,607
You'll find it funny later. 

134
00:04:41,274 --> 00:04:44,207
- He's right. / - He put his name on the tour. 

135
00:04:44,407 --> 00:04:46,840
It means he's pretty confident about the tour plan. 

136
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:48,407
What's the name of your team? 

137
00:04:48,407 --> 00:04:51,107
- Us? / - It's named after our names. 

138
00:04:51,474 --> 00:04:54,507
- 1, 2, 3. Wan Jun Tour. / - 1, 2, 3. Wan Jun Tour. 

139
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:57,374
Wan Jun Tour. 

140
00:04:58,207 --> 00:04:59,740
I wonder how it'd go. 

141
00:05:00,907 --> 00:05:02,574
- I'm not sure. / - He's already worried. 

142
00:05:03,174 --> 00:05:05,940
Would you tell us a bit about it? What did you do? 

143
00:05:06,307 --> 00:05:10,840
As we're in our 30s... 

144
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:12,474
- Pardon? / - What? 

145
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:14,607
We're in our 30s. 

146
00:05:14,607 --> 00:05:18,240
- He's 38 and I'm 39. / - That's right, I'm 38. 

147
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:21,840
Because we find resting important, 

148
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:25,840
we planned it to be a relaxing tour. 

149
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:26,874
- Relaxing is important. / - But... 

150
00:05:26,874 --> 00:05:29,374
- How sad. / - Of course we wouldn't... 

151
00:05:29,374 --> 00:05:31,774
- Just relax. / - Of course not. It's Jun Jin. 

152
00:05:32,174 --> 00:05:34,474
Although not as much as when we were in our primes, 

153
00:05:34,474 --> 00:05:36,007
we did a lot of physical activities. 

154
00:05:36,007 --> 00:05:36,974
- Good job. / - We were quite active. 

155
00:05:36,974 --> 00:05:39,407
- We were. / - Were you? 

156
00:05:39,407 --> 00:05:42,007
What about our team? Did you get active? 

157
00:05:42,007 --> 00:05:43,174
- Yes. / - Or was it rather peaceful? 

158
00:05:43,174 --> 00:05:44,240
We did some physical activities too. 

159
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,774
We ended up being totally worn out. 

160
00:05:45,774 --> 00:05:46,774
He's right. 

161
00:05:46,774 --> 00:05:49,707
- You'll see how it happened. / - Right. 

162
00:05:49,707 --> 00:05:52,140
You were totally worn out on a trip? 

163
00:05:52,307 --> 00:05:54,474
- Because it was so fun. / - It was so fun. 

164
00:05:54,474 --> 00:05:56,274
Both teams went to Jeju-do. 

165
00:05:56,274 --> 00:05:58,040
I wonder how different their trips are. 

166
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:00,407
On episode 2, Lee Jaehoon folded 

167
00:06:00,407 --> 00:06:02,407
the map vertically. 

168
00:06:02,407 --> 00:06:03,907
- I remember that. / - But... 

169
00:06:03,907 --> 00:06:06,140
- We folded the map horizontally. / - Horizontally? 

170
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:08,007
We went to the upper part. 

171
00:06:08,007 --> 00:06:10,140
- You went north. / - And we went to Seogwipo. 

172
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:12,174
- Wan Jun Tour in Seogwipo. / - You went south. 

173
00:06:12,174 --> 00:06:13,607
Isn't it advantageous to us? 

174
00:06:13,607 --> 00:06:14,874
There's more nature in Seogwipo. 

175
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:17,907
- He's right. / - That's not necessarily true. 

176
00:06:17,907 --> 00:06:22,407
To be honest, when you think of traveling in Jeju-do, 

177
00:06:22,407 --> 00:06:24,040
you think of Seogwipo. 

178
00:06:24,307 --> 00:06:25,874
- That's how it is. / - Well done. 

179
00:06:25,874 --> 00:06:28,440
Seogwipo is a classic place to travel. 

180

- It's classic like SHINHWA. / - Exactly. 

181

Jeju City has just begun to develop for tourists. 

182
00:06:35,474 --> 00:06:36,374
It has just started. 

183
00:06:36,374 --> 00:06:38,440
- Yet, it's greatly popular. / - It is. 

184
00:06:38,874 --> 00:06:41,007
- You're right. / - Just like he said... 

185
00:06:41,007 --> 00:06:44,374
If you want a classic trip, you should go to Seogwipo. 

186
00:06:44,374 --> 00:06:46,440
In other words, it's typical. 

187
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:48,407
Exactly. 

188
00:06:48,407 --> 00:06:50,674
Classic means typical. Everyone knows about it. 

189
00:06:50,674 --> 00:06:53,974
- It's safe. / - Just like us... 

190
00:06:53,974 --> 00:06:56,607
Jeju City is trendy these days. 

191
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,074
By the way... 

192
00:07:01,074 --> 00:07:05,474

194
00:07:07,907 --> 00:07:09,907
I heard even mandarins are sweeter in Seogwipo. 

195
00:07:09,907 --> 00:07:11,207
They're sweeter. 

196
00:07:11,274 --> 00:07:14,107
- Mandarins? / - Seogwipo is warmer. 

197
00:07:14,107 --> 00:07:15,307
So mandarins are sweeter. 

198
00:07:15,307 --> 00:07:16,440
Sweeter because it's warmer. 

199
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:20,007
Mandarins from Jeju City taste more refreshing. 

200
00:07:20,007 --> 00:07:21,974

201

202

- They use mandarins from Jeju City. / - I see. 

203
00:07:25,974 --> 00:07:28,440
So refreshing mandarins are good, 

204
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:30,707
but sweet mandarins that make you fat are bad. 

205
00:07:30,707 --> 00:07:31,507

00:12:41,974 --> 00:12:44,240
we're on a trip just the two of us. 

344
00:12:45,074 --> 00:12:47,440
This video footage is going to last forever. 

345
00:12:48,174 --> 00:12:50,340
We can even watch this sometime in the future. 

346
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:52,907
- You still haven't connected it? / - Well, I'm just... 

347
00:12:52,907 --> 00:12:54,640
Then you do it. Why do I have to do it? 

348
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:56,140
It's your phone. 

349
00:12:56,474 --> 00:12:57,707
My gosh. 

350
00:12:57,707 --> 00:12:59,707
Jun Jin didn't know how to connect it with Bluetooth. 

351
00:13:00,774 --> 00:13:02,674
- Dongwan is good with electronics. / - Yes. 

352
00:13:03,074 --> 00:13:03,907
He's good with electronics 

353
00:13:03,907 --> 00:13:05,874
but he's also good at breaking them. 

354
00:13:07,007 --> 00:13:09,607
I can connect it with my phone in an instant. 

355
00:13:09,607 --> 00:13:11,540
Look. I can connect it with my phone right away. 

356
00:13:12,374 --> 00:13:15,207
You think you're MacGyver. 

357
00:13:15,207 --> 00:13:17,240
- Look. / - I can do it too. 

358
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:19,640
System. Why doesn't it work? 

359
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:21,940
Even I couldn't connect it. 

360
00:13:22,774 --> 00:13:24,740
("The Things I Always Want" by SHINHWA) 

361
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:26,274
That's a song from our first album. 

362
00:13:26,274 --> 00:13:27,707
We couldn't connect it with Bluetooth. 

363
00:13:27,707 --> 00:13:29,007
- You just played it on the phone? / - Yes. 

364
00:13:29,007 --> 00:13:30,607
This song calms you. 

365
00:13:30,607 --> 00:13:32,874
I used to like this music video so much. 

366
00:13:32,874 --> 00:13:33,740
(20 years ago, they met each other) 

367
00:13:34,674 --> 00:13:36,640
Time really flies. 

368
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:41,307
(The two have been together for half of their lives) 

369
00:13:42,174 --> 00:13:43,374
(His eyes make their hearts pound) 

370
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:45,774
Jin, you used to be a good singer too. 

371
00:13:45,807 --> 00:13:47,140
(Jin, you used to be a good singer too) 

372
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:48,774
- This is Minwoo. / - Is it? 

373
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:51,274
It's Minwoo's voice, not mine. 

374
00:13:52,207 --> 00:13:54,307
(Embarrassed) 

375
00:13:54,574 --> 00:13:55,807
This is hilarious. 

376
00:13:57,807 --> 00:14:06,474
(They calm down and get lost in the memories) 

377
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:13,807
(Lost in memories, they drive to their first itinerary) 

378
00:14:15,907 --> 00:14:20,774
(1 hour by car to the restaurant) 

379
00:14:20,774 --> 00:14:21,840
Is this the place? 

380
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:24,707
This is a breakfast restaurant that opens at 11 a.m. 

381
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:26,940
It's new. 

382
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:29,474
It's so fancy and they have pretty looking dishes. 

383
00:14:29,474 --> 00:14:30,474
They're delicious too. 

384
00:14:31,607 --> 00:14:32,474
(It's trending in Seogwipo) 

385
00:14:32,474 --> 00:14:33,940
- The presentation is so pretty. / - I agree. 

386
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:36,174
I bet it's popular on social media. 

387
00:14:36,174 --> 00:14:37,040
That's true. 

388
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:38,207
Dayoung, you've never seen that, right? 

389
00:14:38,207 --> 00:14:40,274
- I didn't know such a place existed. / - It's trending. 

390
00:14:40,274 --> 00:14:41,574
- That place looks awesome. / - My gosh. 

391
00:14:41,574 --> 00:14:42,674
You can't make a reservation. 

392
00:14:42,674 --> 00:14:44,640
- You have to wait in line. / - It's a must? 

393
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:48,107
Even though it rained, a lot of people still waited. 

394
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:50,740
There are three breakfast dishes. We'll try all of them. 

395
00:14:50,774 --> 00:14:51,774
We can eat all of them. 

396
00:14:51,774 --> 00:14:53,074
Shrimp marinated in soy sauce on rice. 

397
00:14:53,074 --> 00:14:54,974
- Radish water kimchi with meat. / - Abalone fried rice. 

398
00:14:54,974 --> 00:14:55,940
There are three dishes? 

399
00:14:55,940 --> 00:14:57,107
- Yes. / - I see. 

400
00:14:57,674 --> 00:14:58,774
- I like places like that. / - I'm telling you. 

401
00:14:58,774 --> 00:15:00,840
- All three of them were good. / - They were delicious. 

402
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:02,774
(Here's another hungry guy) 

403
00:15:02,774 --> 00:15:04,674
Our food is here. Here it is. 

404
00:15:05,274 --> 00:15:07,474
(The sight of the food is enough to impress them) 

405
00:15:08,274 --> 00:15:09,307
(They have no choice but to take photos) 

406
00:15:09,307 --> 00:15:11,740
All of these dishes look so pretty. 

407
00:15:15,674 --> 00:15:17,974
I didn't know such restaurants opened up in Jeju-do. 

408
00:15:17,974 --> 00:15:22,007
There are a lot of young restaurant owners nowadays. 

409
00:15:23,374 --> 00:15:27,940
(A trending restaurant in Jeju-do) 

410
00:15:32,274 --> 00:15:33,874
Every dish was delicious but 

411
00:15:33,874 --> 00:15:35,374
especially the marinated shrimp on rice... 

412
00:15:35,374 --> 00:15:37,407
And I don't like shrimp marinated in soy sauce. 

413
00:15:38,174 --> 00:15:39,640
- But it was so good. / - That's it. 

414
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:41,540
- Yes. / - Look at the yolk. 

415
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:43,707
The shrimp was marinated in soy sauce 

416
00:15:43,707 --> 00:15:45,040
but they weren't mushy at all. 

417
00:15:45,174 --> 00:15:46,740
It was firm. 

418
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:49,074
- Gosh, it looks so pretty. / - I want to eat that again. 

419
00:15:49,207 --> 00:15:51,107
- Look at this. / - We should pop the yolk. 

420
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:53,707
- Hey, don't mix it. Don't mix it. / - Why not? 

421
00:15:53,707 --> 00:15:55,707
Mix it little by little. 

422
00:15:55,707 --> 00:15:57,007
- Mix it just a little first. / - We're supposed to mix. 

423
00:15:57,007 --> 00:15:59,007
- Gosh, come on. / - Okay, okay. 

424
00:15:59,007 --> 00:16:01,674
- I hate it when people mix it. / - I don't mix mine. 

425
00:16:01,674 --> 00:16:03,374
- Some people do though. / - I have to mix it as I eat. 

426
00:16:03,374 --> 00:16:05,407
- Some mix everything all at once. / - Why do that? 

427
00:16:05,407 --> 00:16:06,840
Some people mix all the rice in the curry at once. 

428
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,907
- That looks good. / - Some people mix it a bit by bit. 

429
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:15,040
(First, pop the yolk) 

430
00:16:18,107 --> 00:16:24,474
(Mix the yolk with rice and sauce) 

431
00:16:29,574 --> 00:16:31,107
(Tasting) 

432
00:16:31,107 --> 00:16:31,774
- Hold on. / - What? 

433
00:16:31,774 --> 00:16:34,107
- Let's eat it together. / - Sure. 

434
00:16:34,107 --> 00:16:36,340
We're here in Jeju-do for the first time together. 

435
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:37,474
First spoonful. 

436
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:39,107
- Enjoy it. / - Okay. 

437
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:40,740
1, 2, 3. 

438
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:43,174
(They have their first spoonful at last) 

439
00:16:43,174 --> 00:16:45,807
- My goodness. / - We ate a lot for our first meal. 

440
00:16:45,807 --> 00:16:46,840
It was so good. 

441
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:49,540
- What is it? / - This tastes different. 

442
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:51,640
It's different from other restaurants. The soy sauce... 

443
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:54,140
- It's not fishy. / - The shrimp isn't fishy at all. 

444
00:16:54,507 --> 00:16:55,574
I didn't like shrimp in soy sauce 

445
00:16:55,574 --> 00:16:56,907
since I don't like the soft texture. 

446
00:16:57,340 --> 00:16:59,474
But this shrimp in soy sauce is chewy. 

447
00:17:00,107 --> 00:17:02,240
(As soon as they bite into the shrimp) 

448
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:06,474
(They can feel the delicious chewy texture) 

449
00:17:06,874 --> 00:17:09,774
This is similar to sprinkled seasoning... 

450
00:17:10,107 --> 00:17:11,374
On top of the rice. 

451
00:17:11,374 --> 00:17:12,574
All these ingredients complement each other. 

452
00:17:12,574 --> 00:17:13,974
Since the shrimp is marinated in soy sauce, 

453
00:17:13,974 --> 00:17:16,074
they hold together the flavors. 

454
00:17:16,074 --> 00:17:17,940
The shrimp makes the dish more appetizing. 

455
00:17:19,574 --> 00:17:21,740
- That really looks delicious. / - Gosh, look at that. 

456
00:17:22,407 --> 00:17:24,774
Since it has the yolk and shrimp, 

457
00:17:24,774 --> 00:17:26,774
you think kids might not like it but kids will like it. 

458
00:17:26,774 --> 00:17:28,740
- The kids will like this dish. / - Yes, they'll like this. 

459
00:17:29,507 --> 00:17:32,040
I'm having abalone for breakfast. Unbelievable. 

460
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:33,474
(Next up is the abalone fried rice) 

461
00:17:34,807 --> 00:17:36,174
- Is that abalone? / - That was great too. 

462
00:17:36,174 --> 00:17:37,974
- The abalone in the dish... / - Seriously? 

463
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:40,674
- The sauce in the dish... / - The cream sauce. 

464
00:17:40,674 --> 00:17:43,274
- Made it into a Western dish. / - That was like... 

465
00:17:43,274 --> 00:17:45,540
A carbonara sauce. 

466
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:47,340
- It wasn't too rich. / - It's a fusion dish. 

467
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:48,907
The combination of fried rice and cream sauce 

468
00:17:48,907 --> 00:17:50,640
is definitely unique. 

469
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,607
(He smiles as soon as he has a bite) 

470
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:55,474
- This is so good. Here's a tip. / - Is it good? 

471
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:59,040
I don't like cream sauce since it's too rich. 

472
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:00,807
What on earth do you like? You hate everything. 

473
00:18:00,807 --> 00:18:01,940
You don't like anything. 

474
00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:07,507
(He scoops up a big spoonful of the abalone) 

475
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:10,240
- It must taste like risotto. / - That's right. 

476
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:11,874
(He puts it in his mouth right away) 

477
00:18:16,107 --> 00:18:18,374
- It's not too rich, is it? / - It's not. 

478
00:18:18,674 --> 00:18:20,007
They used the right amount of oil here. 

479
00:18:20,207 --> 00:18:21,774
And as for the sauce, 

480
00:18:21,774 --> 00:18:24,240
they used butter and cream sauce, 

481
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:27,474
but it feels like the sauce holds the dish together. 

482
00:18:27,474 --> 00:18:29,307
It might look a bit rich 

483
00:18:29,307 --> 00:18:30,474
but it's not when you have a bite. 

484
00:18:30,474 --> 00:18:34,007
(It might seem too rich but it tastes light) 

485
00:18:35,274 --> 00:18:37,274
I've had a lot of abalone in my lifetime, 

486
00:18:37,274 --> 00:18:40,274
but how can abalone be as tender as this? 

487
00:18:40,274 --> 00:18:42,274
They were the softest abalone I had in my life. 

488
00:18:43,074 --> 00:18:44,874
Wait, did you only eat frozen ones before? 

489
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:46,640
Even when I had wild abalone, 

490
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,240
it wasn't as tender. 

491
00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:49,807
I want to go back again. 

492
00:18:52,007 --> 00:18:57,440
(When the abalone is grilled in butter, it gets savory) 

493
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:59,274
They are tender and chewy. 

494
00:18:59,274 --> 00:19:01,274
- They didn't grill it for too long. / - Right. 

495
00:19:01,274 --> 00:19:03,607
- Overcooked abalone is tough. / - Exactly. 

496
00:19:03,607 --> 00:19:05,340
It's firm and delicious. 

497
00:19:06,707 --> 00:19:08,207
Gosh, the radish water kimchi noodles. 

498
00:19:08,607 --> 00:19:10,774
- Wrap noodles with the meat. / - Right. Hold on. 

499
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:13,940
(Put a piece of Jeju Black pork on top of the noodles) 

500
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:15,940
- What is that now? / - Radish water kimchi noodles. 

501
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:18,574
- Radish water kimchi noodles. / - Jeju Black pork. 

502
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:20,774
- That pork was amazing. / - Okay. 

503
00:19:20,774 --> 00:19:23,374
- Is that Black pork? / - Yes, it is. 

504
00:19:24,007 --> 00:19:25,074
We don't know how... 

505
00:19:25,074 --> 00:19:27,140
- That combination tastes. / - It's Black pork. 

506
00:19:27,207 --> 00:19:29,340
That's the best radish water kimchi noodles 

507
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:30,474
I've had in my life. 

508
00:19:30,474 --> 00:19:32,774
- Come on. / - What have you done with your life? 

509
00:19:32,774 --> 00:19:33,874
I just worked hard. 

510
00:19:33,874 --> 00:19:35,740
He just worked hard. 

511
00:19:35,974 --> 00:19:39,307
(A big mouthful) 

512
00:19:42,407 --> 00:19:43,940
- Is it good? / - It's good. Try it. 

513
00:19:46,274 --> 00:19:47,407
The pork is really tender. 

514
00:19:49,974 --> 00:19:51,007
It's good. 

515
00:19:51,174 --> 00:19:52,507
I like them eaten separately. 

516
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:56,340
- It was really good. / - Let's be honest. 

517
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:57,640
(The pork is too chewy to be eaten with the noodles) 

518
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:00,574
I want to eat the meat separately because it's chewy. 

519
00:20:00,574 --> 00:20:03,440
I don't like having meat for breakfast 

520
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:07,574
but since it's tender and goes well with the noodles, 

521
00:20:07,574 --> 00:20:09,007
I don't mind having it for breakfast. 

522
00:20:09,007 --> 00:20:11,974
- Is that so? / - Noodles alone won't be filling. 

523
00:20:11,974 --> 00:20:13,707
The meat adds another element to the noodles. 

524
00:20:13,707 --> 00:20:16,007
People who don't have meat for breakfast can enjoy it. 

525
00:20:16,007 --> 00:20:17,540
- That's right. / - It's that tender. 

526
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:18,907
- It's not too heavy. / - Exactly, it's not. 

527
00:20:18,907 --> 00:20:20,940
I do agree that the combination is quite unique. 

528
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:23,107
(To wrap up the meal, he has a sip of the broth) 

529
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:26,607
(Feeling refreshed) 

530
00:20:26,607 --> 00:20:29,574
Even if only a couple comes to this restaurant, 

531
00:20:29,574 --> 00:20:31,140
I think they should still order these three dishes. 

532
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:33,007
- They should order all three? / - It was really good. 

533
00:20:33,007 --> 00:20:35,440
It tastes like ordinary fried rice... 

534
00:20:36,307 --> 00:20:37,607
But something is added to it 

535
00:20:37,607 --> 00:20:38,740
and the soy sauce complements it. 

536
00:20:38,907 --> 00:20:40,340
And then as a Korean, 

537
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:41,607
you need to end the meal with this cool broth. 

538
00:20:42,207 --> 00:20:43,307
It wraps up the meal. 

539
00:20:43,307 --> 00:20:44,507
(He approves) 

540
00:20:46,674 --> 00:20:49,240
(Their first meal in Jeju-do was a success) 

541
00:20:49,607 --> 00:20:51,707
After we finish our breakfast, 

542
00:20:51,707 --> 00:20:54,007
let's go swimming to digest our breakfast. 

543
00:20:55,774 --> 00:20:57,374
Look. It's windy. Look at that. 

544
00:20:58,107 --> 00:21:01,474
(The wind in Jeju-do is no joke) 

545
00:21:01,974 --> 00:21:04,540
You know, real surfers still surf even when it rains. 

546
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:06,474
- The sea is calm. / - You have a place in mind, right? 

547
00:21:06,474 --> 00:21:08,374
- Of course. / - Okay, let's go. 

548
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:10,007
Let's eat a bit more and go. 

549
00:21:12,874 --> 00:21:19,140
(They can't stop eating) 

550
00:21:22,107 --> 00:21:23,640
I guess it was really good. 

551
00:21:23,774 --> 00:21:25,040
You kept eating even after the shoot, right? 

552
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:26,240
- Yes, we did. / - My gosh. 

553
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:28,274
- It looks delicious. / - You're eating it with gusto. 

554
00:21:28,274 --> 00:21:30,207
- They won over Baekho. / - No, no. 

555
00:21:30,207 --> 00:21:31,307
- You zoned out. / - No. 

556
00:21:31,307 --> 00:21:33,307
- I saw you gaping at the clip. / - He's having fun. 

557
00:21:33,607 --> 00:21:34,874
Have you been there, Baekho? 

558
00:21:34,874 --> 00:21:37,174
- No, I haven't been to Seogwipo. / - Is that so? 

559
00:21:37,174 --> 00:21:38,707
Locals from Jeju-do say that... 

560
00:21:38,707 --> 00:21:41,174
- They go over to Seogwipo. / - That's right. 

561
00:21:41,174 --> 00:21:43,074
"I don't go over there much." 

562
00:21:43,307 --> 00:21:44,374
They literally have to go over to get there. 

563
00:21:44,374 --> 00:21:44,907
That's true. 

564
00:21:44,907 --> 00:21:46,907
- You can get everything from there. / - Exactly. 

565
00:21:46,907 --> 00:21:48,807
(What will happen to their water activity?) 

566
00:21:50,507 --> 00:21:51,774
(Wan Jun Tour, Play Day) 

567
00:21:51,774 --> 00:21:55,407
(Swimming in a naturally-formed swimming pool) 

568
00:21:56,374 --> 00:22:00,140
(Where's the spot Dongwan chose for swimming?) 

569
00:22:00,140 --> 00:22:01,474
(It takes 30 minutes by car to the coast) 

570
00:22:02,307 --> 00:22:05,107
I should look for some tourist attractions. 

571
00:22:05,107 --> 00:22:07,140
Hwangwooji Coast is a gem. 

572
00:22:07,907 --> 00:22:09,107
We can snorkel there? 

573
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,407
This is nice. 

574
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:16,840
Snorkeling in Hwangwooji Coast. I didn't think of that. 

575
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:21,174
(Hwangwooji Coast, a hidden region in Seogwipo) 

576
00:22:21,774 --> 00:22:24,840
(This unique vacation spot in Jeju-do has been trending) 

577
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:27,207
- What's that? / - Isn't that amazing? 

578
00:22:27,207 --> 00:22:29,907
- That looks... / - Just like the cage culture... 

579
00:22:29,907 --> 00:22:32,040
The swimming pool is like the cage. 

580
00:22:32,107 --> 00:22:33,474
Since tides come in and out, 

581
00:22:33,474 --> 00:22:35,374
there are a lot of tropical fish in the water. 

582
00:22:35,374 --> 00:22:36,640
People go there to snorkel... 

583
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:39,707
- And catch fish too. / - I never knew that existed. 

584
00:22:41,540 --> 00:22:42,774
Gosh, what is this? 

585
00:22:43,607 --> 00:22:44,874
- Dongwan, you know... / - My goodness. 

586
00:22:44,874 --> 00:22:47,507
How could there be a typhoon all of a sudden? 

587
00:22:47,507 --> 00:22:48,507
(He embraces Jin as he's sorry) 

588
00:22:48,507 --> 00:22:49,640
Hey, Jeju-do is famous for its rain. 

589
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:52,874
- Hey, you know what? Dongwan. / - What? 

590
00:22:53,674 --> 00:22:56,040
- Swimming is most fun in the rain. / - You bet. 

591
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:57,374
- Let's go. / - Feel the wind. It's great. 

592
00:22:57,374 --> 00:22:58,374
Run! 

593
00:22:58,707 --> 00:23:01,707
(Fine, let's get going) 

594
00:23:01,707 --> 00:23:04,774
- Swimming is fun when it rains. / - That's true. 

595
00:23:04,774 --> 00:23:06,140
It makes you lose control. 

596
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:08,640
You know, when it rains and is windy... 

597
00:23:09,007 --> 00:23:10,840
Swimming is the most fun. It's the best. 

598
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:12,507
I like it. Watch out. 

599
00:23:14,907 --> 00:23:16,607
(As they head down, bad feelings loom over them) 

600
00:23:16,607 --> 00:23:19,107
I think it's closed because it's pouring today. 

601
00:23:20,107 --> 00:23:21,840
(Feeling nervous and worried) 

602
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:23,307
(What is this? Are we the only ones here?) 

603
00:23:23,307 --> 00:23:25,207
- I bet no one is there. / - Exactly. 

604
00:23:25,207 --> 00:23:26,740
No, there are some people. 

605
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:29,007
(They spot people who they assume swam there) 

606
00:23:29,807 --> 00:23:30,840
(They're nearing the sea as they go down) 

607
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:32,340
- I can see the ocean. / - My gosh. 

608
00:23:33,807 --> 00:23:35,840
- Look at the waves. / - Amazing. 

609
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:37,907
- The scenery looks awesome. / - This is unbelievable. 

610
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:42,207
(How does the pool look on Hwangwooji Coast?) 

611
00:23:44,574 --> 00:23:45,774
- Why? / - My gosh. 

612
00:23:46,107 --> 00:23:47,407
- Those waves. / - Gosh. 

613
00:23:47,407 --> 00:23:48,807
(It's closed due to the storm and the weather) 

614
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:53,774
- This is driving me crazy. / - That place is great. 

615
00:23:53,774 --> 00:23:55,207
We should've gone on a sunny day. 

616
00:23:55,207 --> 00:23:56,707
I'm really going to go back one day. 

617
00:23:56,707 --> 00:23:58,840
- Goodness. You can't go in there. / - Gosh. 

618
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:00,507
- You could die. / - Right. 

619
00:24:01,274 --> 00:24:02,374
You must've been disappointed. 

620
00:24:02,374 --> 00:24:03,807
- We were so disappointed. / - I can imagine. 

621
00:24:03,807 --> 00:24:05,140
I've never seen something like this in person. 

622
00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:07,840
But I understand that it's a nice place. 

623
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:09,574
You can go there next time. 

624
00:24:09,574 --> 00:24:12,107
- That's called Seonnyeotang. / - "Fairies' Pond." 

625
00:24:12,107 --> 00:24:14,107
(Checking the weather is a must before traveling) 

626
00:24:16,707 --> 00:24:18,240
It's really summer now. 

627
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:23,207
- Gosh. / - This is amazing. 

628
00:24:23,207 --> 00:24:25,474
(They engrave the view of the ocean in their eyes) 

629
00:24:25,474 --> 00:24:27,007
The rain is very cooling. 

630
00:24:30,107 --> 00:24:31,274
By the way, this place looks awesome. 

631
00:24:32,074 --> 00:24:33,740
It's like a scene from a movie. 

632
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:36,707
(White waves continuously roll in) 

633
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:38,140
It's nice. 

634
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,107
The waves. 

635
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:42,074
It'd be nice to come here when the weather's nice. 

636
00:24:42,074 --> 00:24:43,574
(Dongwan is feeling sad) 

637
00:24:43,574 --> 00:24:44,940
It looks really nice. 

638
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:46,407
Let's go somewhere else. 

639
00:24:46,407 --> 00:24:47,774
- Yes. / - Let's go. 

640
00:24:48,607 --> 00:24:49,774
But it feels cool. 

641
00:24:49,774 --> 00:24:54,174
(They'll return here again one day) 

642
00:24:54,674 --> 00:24:56,874
- 10 places to go on a rainy day. / - Okay. 

643
00:24:57,340 --> 00:24:58,440
LAN center. 

644
00:24:59,974 --> 00:25:01,307
It says right here. 

645
00:25:01,307 --> 00:25:03,507
He's looking for a hot LAN center. 

646
00:25:03,507 --> 00:25:05,074
(Dongwan is looking things up) 

647
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:07,707
(Jun Jin gets rained on) 

648
00:25:07,707 --> 00:25:09,374
I got water slapped. 

649
00:25:11,207 --> 00:25:12,507
Here! 

650
00:25:13,174 --> 00:25:15,007
- Okay. Go. / - Let's go. 

651
00:25:15,607 --> 00:25:17,107
- Bye. / - We could've spent 3 hours here. 

652
00:25:17,107 --> 00:25:19,740
(See you again when it's sunny) 

653
00:25:19,874 --> 00:25:21,807
It's cool here though. 

654
00:25:21,807 --> 00:25:23,374
(They set off to the next destination) 

655
00:25:23,374 --> 00:25:25,774
- What's the next place? / - I'll visit here next time. 

656
00:25:25,774 --> 00:25:29,274
(What's the alternative Dongwan found?) 

657
00:25:29,540 --> 00:25:31,840
- Did you change it suddenly? / - Yes, we had to. 

658
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:33,774
- But that's what makes it fun. / - Right. 

659
00:25:33,774 --> 00:25:35,440
- Because it rained too much. / - The weather... 

660
00:25:37,540 --> 00:25:39,307
(From the coast) 

661
00:25:39,307 --> 00:25:41,040
(They drive 50 minutes to Namwon) 

662
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:43,607
In Jeju-do, it suddenly stops raining. 

663
00:25:43,974 --> 00:25:45,174
- It becomes sunny. / - That's right. 

664
00:25:45,174 --> 00:25:46,707
- That's right. / - It suddenly snows. 

665
00:25:46,707 --> 00:25:47,907
The weather is strange there. 

666
00:25:47,907 --> 00:25:49,574
There are so many places to go in Jeju-do, 

667
00:25:49,574 --> 00:25:50,840
even when it rains. 

668
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:51,407
Really? 

669
00:25:51,407 --> 00:25:53,074
Isn't there a place called Eongtto Falls? 

670
00:25:53,074 --> 00:25:55,074
- You can see it in the rain. / - Yes, Eongtto Falls is... 

671
00:25:55,074 --> 00:25:56,940
- More beautiful when it rains. / - Right. 

672
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:59,640
The waterfall is so cool. 

673
00:26:00,107 --> 00:26:01,307
Where are we going now? 

674
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:03,507
It's a circuit cafe. 

675
00:26:03,507 --> 00:26:05,107
- Have you been here before? / - A cafe? 

676
00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:06,907
It's not an ordinary cafe though. 

677
00:26:07,107 --> 00:26:08,274
- This is... / - Okay. 

678
00:26:08,807 --> 00:26:10,107
A Jeju-do cafe. 

679
00:26:10,107 --> 00:26:11,174
What? 

680
00:26:11,774 --> 00:26:12,840
I know that. 

681
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:14,707
- What they have here are... / - Okay. 

682
00:26:14,707 --> 00:26:16,474
I used to collect RC cars before. 

683
00:26:16,607 --> 00:26:19,007
You can play with RC cars if you order coffee. 

684
00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:20,540
- For free? / - Yes. 

685
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:22,907
We went to an RC car cafe. 

686
00:26:22,907 --> 00:26:24,640
- I've never been. / - You shouldn't fall for it. 

687
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,940
I never knew there was an RC cafe. 

688
00:26:27,340 --> 00:26:29,140
- That's what I love. / - If you order beverages... 

689
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:32,707
You can experience RC cars for free. 

690
00:26:32,707 --> 00:26:33,907
(There is an outdoor RC car race track) 

691
00:26:33,907 --> 00:26:36,274
- There are various RC cars. / - That's unusual. 

692
00:26:36,607 --> 00:26:38,807
- It's outdoors? / - They have a huge track. 

693
00:26:38,807 --> 00:26:40,040
They can hold competitions. 

694
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:42,640
(There is an outdoor RC car race track) 

695
00:26:43,174 --> 00:26:48,207
(You can enjoy all this if you order a beverage) 

696
00:26:48,407 --> 00:26:49,640
Let's race. 

697
00:26:50,140 --> 00:26:52,240
- Let's try it. I want to do it. / - Okay. 

698
00:26:52,874 --> 00:26:54,540
What will we bet? 

699
00:26:55,074 --> 00:26:56,274
- Loser buys dinner. / - Pork. 

700
00:26:56,274 --> 00:26:57,874
- Okay. / - The Jeju Black Pig. 

701
00:26:57,874 --> 00:26:58,974
Okay. 

702
00:26:58,974 --> 00:27:00,974
We'd like to order two coffees. 

703
00:27:00,974 --> 00:27:03,140
How much is it to drive a good one? 

704
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:05,040
I want a better model. 

705
00:27:05,774 --> 00:27:07,507
I'm okay with regular ones. 

706
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:10,407
- I'll drive the best one. / - Okay. 

707
00:27:10,407 --> 00:27:12,974
Can you use RC cars for an unlimited time? 

708
00:27:12,974 --> 00:27:14,874
- No. / - There is a time limit. 

709
00:27:14,874 --> 00:27:17,240
It's limited to 15 to 20 minutes. 

710
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:19,140
So a lot of people can use it. 

711
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:22,540
RC cars range from $10 to thousands of dollars. 

712
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:24,874
Really? What if you break it? 

713
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:26,740
Only experienced people can borrow 

714
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:27,740
the expensive ones. 

715
00:27:28,274 --> 00:27:30,474
- Adults only. / - You have to pay $2. 

716
00:27:30,474 --> 00:27:32,274
We have that at our dorm. 

717
00:27:32,274 --> 00:27:35,040
- We do, but it's different. / - We have all that. 

718
00:27:35,207 --> 00:27:36,440
You don't have to go there 

719
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:38,240
because you have it in your dorm. 

720
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:41,407
(The sudden rainfall) 

721
00:27:42,507 --> 00:27:46,307
(Results in a sudden competition) 

722
00:27:47,007 --> 00:27:48,440
I won't go easy on him. 

723
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:49,640
("I won't go easy on him," Jun Jin) 

724
00:27:50,474 --> 00:27:53,140
(Dongwan is an experienced RC car driver) 

725
00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:54,940
Aren't experienced users better at this? 

726
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:56,874
Dongwan has been doing it for a long time. 

727
00:27:56,874 --> 00:27:58,407
It's not easy. 

728
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:01,440
- This match is meaningless then. / - It is. 

729
00:28:01,874 --> 00:28:03,407
Jun Jin kept cheating. 

730
00:28:03,407 --> 00:28:04,507
When did I do that? 

731
00:28:04,507 --> 00:28:06,107
- You'll see he keeps cheating. / - Let's take a look. 

732
00:28:06,174 --> 00:28:07,607
Let's use our personal cards, not the company card. 

733
00:28:08,707 --> 00:28:11,140
- Stop with the nonsense. / - Why are you trembling? 

734
00:28:11,207 --> 00:28:12,707
I need a handicap. 

735
00:28:12,707 --> 00:28:13,907
Because you've done this a lot before. 

736
00:28:13,907 --> 00:28:14,640
This is my first time. 

737
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:16,074
Don't I get a handicap? 

738
00:28:16,074 --> 00:28:18,340
No, because this isn't my RC car. 

739
00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:20,374
- Come on. / - It's not my car. 

740
00:28:20,374 --> 00:28:21,807
Hey, cue sticks are important in billiards. 

741
00:28:21,807 --> 00:28:23,774
- Having your own RC car is important. / - Not true. 

742
00:28:24,107 --> 00:28:25,874
- Two laps. / - Dongwan is trying to win. 

743
00:28:26,774 --> 00:28:28,140
- Of course. / - You're trying to win. 

744
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:30,207
We'll do 2 laps. But even 1 lap is hard. 

745
00:28:30,207 --> 00:28:32,607
We'll go like this. 

746
00:28:32,607 --> 00:28:34,007
I need to imagine this. 

747
00:28:34,540 --> 00:28:36,640
Let's go. Okay, get ready. 2 laps. 

748
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:38,074
Alright, 1. 

749
00:28:38,074 --> 00:28:39,174
(Who will win this race?) 

750
00:28:39,174 --> 00:28:41,407
- That looks like fun. / - This isn't my car though. 

751
00:28:41,407 --> 00:28:43,774
It was difficult because he gave me a really nice car. 

752
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:45,340
2, 3. 

753
00:28:46,007 --> 00:28:46,940
2, 3. 

754
00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:49,474
(Jun Jin's car) 

755
00:28:49,474 --> 00:28:50,707
- What are you doing? / - Why isn't it moving? 

756
00:28:50,707 --> 00:28:52,107
He's going easy on him. 

757
00:28:52,107 --> 00:28:53,274
It was hard. 

758
00:28:53,274 --> 00:28:54,340
(Dongwan lets Jun Jin go first) 

759
00:28:54,674 --> 00:28:56,540
- That speed... / - You let him go first. 

760
00:28:56,540 --> 00:28:57,907
- This... / - The speed... 

761
00:28:57,907 --> 00:28:59,174
Is different. 

762
00:28:59,174 --> 00:29:00,240
- It's hard. / - Dongwan is good. 

763
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:02,174
- No! / - Direction is difficult. 

764
00:29:02,174 --> 00:29:04,074
It's really hard. It's confusing. 

765
00:29:05,140 --> 00:29:06,274
Goodness. 

766
00:29:06,807 --> 00:29:08,440
Is this how you do it? 

767
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:10,040
- Goodness. / - He got out. 

768
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:11,040
I'm turning. 

769
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:13,274
What? That's cheating. 

770
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:16,540
Like this. Dongwan, what should I do? 

771
00:29:16,674 --> 00:29:17,774
What should I do? 

772
00:29:19,307 --> 00:29:20,940
- Gosh. / - Goodness. 

773
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:22,107
Dongwan is amazing. 

774
00:29:22,107 --> 00:29:25,040
I'm not that good. 

775
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:26,174
What should I do with it? 

776
00:29:27,074 --> 00:29:28,107
What are you doing? 

777
00:29:28,107 --> 00:29:29,207
(It's a mess) 

778
00:29:29,207 --> 00:29:30,507
- Jun Jin. / - Go over. 

779
00:29:31,107 --> 00:29:32,740
- No. / - He's reckless. 

780
00:29:34,607 --> 00:29:36,240
(Jun Jin is making his own way) 

781
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:38,774
- I went over. / - Hey. 

782
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:40,674
That's cheating. 

783
00:29:40,674 --> 00:29:42,407
What? 

784
00:29:43,507 --> 00:29:45,740
- That track is meaningless. / - Exactly. 

785
00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:47,507
(Where I go is the way) 

786
00:29:47,507 --> 00:29:48,807
Just go over. 

787
00:29:48,807 --> 00:29:51,240
He's creating his own track. 

788
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:53,140
You completely jumped the tracks. 

789
00:29:57,340 --> 00:29:59,407
Hey, you completely jumped the tracks. 

790
00:29:59,574 --> 00:30:01,274
I'm not doing this on purpose. 

791
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:03,840
(Dongwan is totally focused) 

792
00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:06,607
Dongwan is actually really good. 

793
00:30:06,607 --> 00:30:07,840
They have to do 2 laps. 

794
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:09,740
That's right. Usually, a race is 2 laps. 

795
00:30:10,307 --> 00:30:12,040
He caught up. 

796
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,340
- What? / - Whenever he's there... 

797
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:16,440
- Isn't that the same spot? / - It is. 

798
00:30:17,507 --> 00:30:20,007
- Is that a parking lot? / - This is so funny. 

799
00:30:20,207 --> 00:30:22,707
What? The car is weird. 

800
00:30:23,007 --> 00:30:24,707
- You're weird. / - No. Look. 

801
00:30:25,874 --> 00:30:27,307
- The tire is stuck. / - You have to get it out. 

802
00:30:27,374 --> 00:30:29,174
You have to go and get it out. 

803
00:30:30,007 --> 00:30:32,974
(Jun Jin runs over to take the car out) 

804
00:30:32,974 --> 00:30:34,940
- Take it out and put it on the track. / - Move! 

805
00:30:35,307 --> 00:30:37,040
(Jun Jin is disrupting Dongwan's car) 

806
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:38,174
Get out! 

807
00:30:38,707 --> 00:30:40,140
Get out of the way. 

808
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:42,674
(If I can't race, you can't either) 

809
00:30:43,574 --> 00:30:46,707
(Jun Jin rescues his car after disrupting Dongwan) 

810
00:30:49,540 --> 00:30:50,907
- That looks like fun. / - This is exciting. 

811
00:30:50,907 --> 00:30:52,440
Dongwan is so good. 

812
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:54,107
Don't cheat! 

813
00:30:58,574 --> 00:31:00,574
He cheats, then pretends nothing happened. 

814
00:31:01,007 --> 00:31:02,274
- Good job! / - Look at him. 

815
00:31:03,174 --> 00:31:04,240
(Jun Jin is racing across the tracks again) 

816
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:06,240
(What's wrong?) 

817
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:08,774
(I'm going to win!) 

818
00:31:09,340 --> 00:31:11,507
(He is almost at the finish line) 

819
00:31:11,874 --> 00:31:13,174
(Again?) 

820
00:31:13,174 --> 00:31:14,774
- Again? / - Hurry up. 

821
00:31:14,774 --> 00:31:16,540
- Get it out. / - That serves you right. 

822
00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:17,807
That serves him right. 

823
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:21,740
(He's running more than the car is racing) 

824
00:31:21,740 --> 00:31:24,207
You're moving more than your car. 

825
00:31:24,207 --> 00:31:25,274
Exactly. 

826
00:31:25,274 --> 00:31:27,440
- I'm almost finished. / - It's like a running race. 

827
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:28,607
(While Jun Jin is running) 

828
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:31,940
(Dongwan speeds up his car) 

829
00:31:33,274 --> 00:31:35,440
(Everyone is watching to see who the winner is) 

830
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:36,574
Stop the car. 

831
00:31:37,507 --> 00:31:38,607
Again. 

832
00:31:40,707 --> 00:31:43,140
(Dongwan's car passes Jun Jin by) 

833
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:44,474
He's blocking. 

834
00:31:44,474 --> 00:31:46,140
(Dongwan's car) 

835
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:47,340
Nice blocking. 

836
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:48,974
- Gosh. / - Goodness. 

837
00:31:48,974 --> 00:31:50,274
(Dongwan wins by blocking) 

838
00:31:50,274 --> 00:31:51,540
That was dramatic. 

839
00:31:51,874 --> 00:31:53,240
How could that happen? 

840
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:54,674
Call the referee. 

841
00:31:55,707 --> 00:31:57,674
- Call the referee. / - You cheated. 

842
00:31:58,407 --> 00:32:01,207
(RC match is a tie) 

843
00:32:01,207 --> 00:32:02,507
It's a tie. 

844
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:06,174
It was so funny when your car went across the tracks. 

845
00:32:06,174 --> 00:32:07,740
(The funny circuit outlaw) 

846
00:32:08,674 --> 00:32:12,540
(Wan Jun Tour takes a break at the cafe) 

847
00:32:12,974 --> 00:32:14,107
What will you do now? 

848
00:32:14,507 --> 00:32:16,240
- Today's your day. / - Today? 

849
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:17,407
Tomorrow is my day. 

850
00:32:17,407 --> 00:32:19,107
(He's pressuring Dongwan to find something to do) 

851
00:32:19,107 --> 00:32:20,407
Even if it rains... 

852
00:32:20,407 --> 00:32:22,474
- I want to ride something. / - Yes. 

853
00:32:23,074 --> 00:32:25,140
- Even if it's muddy. / - I'd rather do that. 

854
00:32:25,707 --> 00:32:26,840
That'd be fun. 

855
00:32:27,874 --> 00:32:29,040
Let's go ride all-terrain vehicles. 

856
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:32,474
- I like that. / - Okay. 

857
00:32:32,574 --> 00:32:33,674
I wanted to ride that. 

858
00:32:34,540 --> 00:32:37,074
(The sudden rain started) 

859
00:32:37,540 --> 00:32:39,907
(These two men) 

860
00:32:41,107 --> 00:32:42,507
(To chase) 

861
00:32:42,507 --> 00:32:44,574
(And chase) 

862
00:32:46,807 --> 00:32:48,974
(The place of their final match) 

863
00:32:49,207 --> 00:32:50,940
(Start) 

864
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:53,874
(They arrive after driving for 30 minutes) 

865
00:32:54,174 --> 00:32:56,574
Let's have a real match here. 

866
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:58,174
What we did earlier... 

867
00:32:58,507 --> 00:33:01,007
Because you're experienced, it wasn't fair. 

868
00:33:01,574 --> 00:33:02,874
Let's do this one. 

869
00:33:02,874 --> 00:33:04,974
- Yes. / - Okay. 

870
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:06,440
I really wanted to try this. 

871
00:33:07,274 --> 00:33:10,307
(What will be their final race?) 

872
00:33:11,474 --> 00:33:14,007
(First match is go-kart) 

873
00:33:15,707 --> 00:33:18,474
(Confident racer, Jun Jin) 

874
00:33:19,907 --> 00:33:22,474
(Sure to win again, Dongwan) 

875
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:27,040
(Battle Trip Part 2 will be aired soon) 

876
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:29,892
(What will be their final race?) 

877
00:33:30,892 --> 00:33:33,092
(Their first match is go-kart) 

878
00:33:33,092 --> 00:33:35,492
- Didn't Sikyung ride that before? / - In Japan. 

879
00:33:35,492 --> 00:33:37,059
I drove that in the city. 

880
00:33:37,059 --> 00:33:38,259
Right, right. 

881
00:33:38,259 --> 00:33:40,292
- Overseas. / - Can I drive it without a license? 

882
00:33:40,292 --> 00:33:41,926
Yes, you can drive it without a driver's license. 

883
00:33:41,926 --> 00:33:43,359
That's the difference from Japan. 

884
00:33:43,359 --> 00:33:44,926
You need a license in Japan. 

885
00:33:44,926 --> 00:33:46,392
- Do they lend you... / - It suits them. 

886
00:33:46,392 --> 00:33:48,659
- The character costumes? / - Yes, you can hire it. 

887
00:33:48,659 --> 00:33:49,659
Really? 

888
00:33:54,126 --> 00:33:56,759
(Confident racer, Jun Jin) 

889
00:33:58,292 --> 00:34:01,159
(Sure to win again, Dongwan) 

890
00:34:04,059 --> 00:34:06,992
(The one who finishes 2 laps first wins the match) 

891
00:34:11,259 --> 00:34:12,326
Start! 

892
00:34:16,192 --> 00:34:18,592
(Feeling excited) 

893
00:34:20,692 --> 00:34:22,692
(Dongwan takes the lead) 

894
00:34:22,692 --> 00:34:24,459
- This is the real deal. / - Yes. 

895
00:34:24,459 --> 00:34:25,859
- That must be so much fun. / - It's fun. 

896
00:34:25,859 --> 00:34:27,659
People can drift on those karts. 

897
00:34:27,992 --> 00:34:30,426
- It's faster than I thought. / - Yes, it's fast. 

898
00:34:30,426 --> 00:34:32,126
(He almost catches up with Dongwan) 

899
00:34:32,592 --> 00:34:35,126
(Dongwan turns the corner first) 

900
00:34:36,092 --> 00:34:38,292
(I can't lose to him) 

901
00:34:38,759 --> 00:34:41,059
(At that moment, Jun Jin cuts into the inner lane) 

902
00:34:41,059 --> 00:34:43,059
- The inside lane. / - The inside lane is the way to go. 

903
00:34:43,692 --> 00:34:44,759
Look at you, Jin. 

904
00:34:44,759 --> 00:34:47,259
It's for 6th graders and over. 

905
00:34:47,259 --> 00:34:48,259
(Getting rained on while driving is fun) 

906
00:34:48,259 --> 00:34:50,692
Since it rained that day, we had to battle in the rain. 

907
00:34:50,692 --> 00:34:51,992
It was really fun. 

908
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:55,159
(Dongwan closes the gap quickly) 

909
00:34:55,159 --> 00:34:57,126
(I'm almost caught up with him) 

910
00:34:57,226 --> 00:34:58,926
Can Dongwan catch up with Jin? 

911
00:34:59,792 --> 00:35:01,159
(Who will overtake who?) 

912
00:35:01,159 --> 00:35:02,592
Take the inside lane. 

913
00:35:05,892 --> 00:35:07,059
- Take the inside lane. / - Inside lane. 

914
00:35:07,059 --> 00:35:08,859
- There you go. / - Inside. 

915
00:35:08,859 --> 00:35:12,226
(Jin overtakes Dongwan first) 

916
00:35:12,859 --> 00:35:15,159
Come at me. Come. 

917
00:35:16,226 --> 00:35:17,926
Come at me. Give it your best shot. 

918
00:35:18,192 --> 00:35:19,559
Come at me. 

919
00:35:20,026 --> 00:35:21,526
Drift! 

920
00:35:21,526 --> 00:35:23,826
(Who will win the match?) 

921
00:35:23,826 --> 00:35:25,526
- What is happening? / - The gap is widening. 

922
00:35:26,026 --> 00:35:26,926
Why is there a huge gap? 

923
00:35:26,926 --> 00:35:28,492
(All he has to do is exit from the lane) 

924
00:35:28,492 --> 00:35:31,292
- Out! / - No way! 

925
00:35:33,126 --> 00:35:35,659
- What happened? / - I didn't know where to exit. 

926
00:35:36,192 --> 00:35:37,559
Where do we exit from? 

927
00:35:38,026 --> 00:35:41,126
(What?) 

928
00:35:42,092 --> 00:35:43,626
(They can't find the finish line) 

929
00:35:43,626 --> 00:35:46,492
- We kept going. / - How many laps did you drive? 

930
00:35:47,026 --> 00:35:49,026
We just kept driving since it was fun. 

931
00:35:49,026 --> 00:35:50,826
(In the end, this match was a tie) 

932
00:35:50,826 --> 00:35:52,392
We didn't know where the exit was. 

933
00:35:52,859 --> 00:35:55,326
- You should exit now. / - We kept driving. 

934
00:35:55,326 --> 00:35:57,326
You should exit now. It's about time that you got out. 

935
00:35:57,692 --> 00:35:59,992
No one won the match. 

936
00:35:59,992 --> 00:36:01,792
- Let's have another match. / - Sure, let's do that. 

937
00:36:02,126 --> 00:36:04,326
- Okay? / - This match is a tie.

00:36:04,326 --> 00:36:06,659
- It's another tie? / - The matches kept ending in ties. 

939
00:36:06,659 --> 00:36:08,292
Rock, paper, scissors. 

940
00:36:08,292 --> 00:36:10,192
- You pay. / - You can't always play paper. 

941
00:36:10,192 --> 00:36:11,626
- Let's settle this in the next one. / - Okay. 

942
00:36:11,626 --> 00:36:13,192
- I got it. Let's go. / - But you're still paying for this. 

943
00:36:18,392 --> 00:36:20,026
- Good job. / - They're cute. 

944
00:36:20,026 --> 00:36:22,226
(Now, they'll decide on which one is the true winner) 

945
00:36:22,792 --> 00:36:23,926
What is it this time? 

946
00:36:23,926 --> 00:36:26,259
- ATVs. / - I really wanted to ride an ATV. 

947
00:36:28,559 --> 00:36:31,726
(The ATVs will bring an end to their match) 

948
00:36:31,726 --> 00:36:32,859
Per person... 

949
00:36:32,859 --> 00:36:36,059
It's $55 for the go-kart and ATV. 

950
00:36:36,059 --> 00:36:37,459
You can enjoy them both. 

951
00:36:37,626 --> 00:36:40,192
- You can ride both in one place? / - That's correct. 

952
00:36:40,526 --> 00:36:41,526
The four wheelers. 

953
00:36:41,526 --> 00:36:42,859
(That looks fun) 

954
00:36:42,859 --> 00:36:44,892
- This is similar to a bicycle. / - Okay. 

955
00:36:44,892 --> 00:36:47,259
- Grab brake levers with both hands. / - Okay. 

956
00:36:47,259 --> 00:36:50,526
- Press the accelerator and release slowly. / - Okay. 

957
00:36:52,059 --> 00:36:53,759
Hey, this is the last match for real. 

958
00:36:53,759 --> 00:36:56,026
- Okay. The loser buys dinner. / - Loser buys dinner. 

959
00:36:56,026 --> 00:36:57,692

960
00:36:57,926 --> 00:36:59,759
- Let's go. Get ready. / - Get ready. 

961
00:37:00,626 --> 00:37:01,792
Set. 

962
00:37:01,792 --> 00:37:03,792
(Their match began because of the rain) 

963
00:37:03,892 --> 00:37:04,926
Start! 

964
00:37:04,926 --> 00:37:11,726
(The Black pork dinner is at stake) 

965
00:37:12,126 --> 00:37:16,559
(Who will be the winner of this match?) 

966
00:37:16,826 --> 00:37:19,726
(Jun Jin) 

967
00:37:22,692 --> 00:37:25,159
- We could climb up the hill too. / - It was really fun. 

968
00:37:25,159 --> 00:37:25,926
So fascinating. 

969
00:37:25,926 --> 00:37:28,092
- It seems so fast. / - It was really fast. 

970
00:37:28,092 --> 00:37:30,459
It was fast and... 

971
00:37:30,459 --> 00:37:33,192
How should I put it? It felt like we were in nature. 

972
00:37:33,192 --> 00:37:33,859
(Jun Jin wins) 

973
00:37:34,359 --> 00:37:36,959
(Dongwan loses) 

974
00:37:38,626 --> 00:37:41,059
(The final winner is Jun Jin) 

975
00:37:41,059 --> 00:37:42,526
Jun Jin wins. 

976
00:37:43,192 --> 00:37:45,592
- You'll win when you're not scared. / - I won. I'm hungry. 

977
00:37:45,592 --> 00:37:48,092
- He was ruthless. / - The Jeju Black Pig! 

978
00:37:48,092 --> 00:37:49,626
- Okay. / - The Jeju Black Pig! 

979
00:37:51,092 --> 00:37:52,926
(Feeling disappointed) 

980
00:37:53,126 --> 00:37:55,226
- Let's go eat. / - Let's go. 

981
00:37:55,226 --> 00:37:57,159

I won! 

984
00:38:03,692 --> 00:38:05,026
I'm glad you found something else 

985
00:38:05,026 --> 00:38:06,092
to do in the rain. 

986
00:38:06,092 --> 00:38:07,392
- I agree. / - Exactly. 

987
00:38:07,392 --> 00:38:08,492
What a relief. 

988
00:38:08,726 --> 00:38:10,259
Some people don't visit Jeju-do 

989
00:38:10,259 --> 00:38:11,059
because of the weather. 

990
00:38:11,059 --> 00:38:12,259
There are a lot of things for you to do 

991
00:38:12,259 --> 00:38:13,392
even on rainy days. 

992
00:38:13,526 --> 00:38:14,959
(Wan Jun Tour, Play Day) 

993
00:38:14,959 --> 00:38:15,826
(Dinner with a view of the beach) 

994
00:38:15,826 --> 00:38:18,559
That's a place I looked up. 

995
00:38:19,792 --> 00:38:21,259
They barbecue pork 

996
00:38:21,259 --> 00:38:22,926
in drum cans with coal briquettes. 

997
00:38:22,926 --> 00:38:24,626
- It's Black Pig. / - There was a barbecue restaurant. 

998
00:38:25,059 --> 00:38:26,426
- Really? / - Yes. 

999
00:38:26,426 --> 00:38:27,892
(Wan Jun Tour arrives in front of a common beach) 

1000
00:38:27,892 --> 00:38:29,826
I can't believe I get to see this view in Jeju-do. 

1001
00:38:29,826 --> 00:38:31,292
- The waves. / - Look at the waves. 

1002
00:38:31,326 --> 00:38:33,592
- I love the smell of the sea. / - Great, great. 

1003
00:38:34,092 --> 00:38:35,292
The smell of the sea? 

1004
00:38:35,292 --> 00:38:36,592
(Is he going to do that?) 

1005
00:38:37,526 --> 00:38:39,592
(He's one amazing dude) 

1006
00:38:40,159 --> 00:38:41,626
(He's adorable) 

1007
00:38:41,859 --> 00:38:42,959
(He's excited at the thought of eating meat) 

1008
00:38:42,959 --> 00:38:45,259
There are a lot of new interesting places. 

1009
00:38:45,259 --> 00:38:47,826
- His stamina is amazing. / - Exactly. 

1010
00:38:48,226 --> 00:38:50,592
- It's better than ours. / - He keeps moving his body. 

1011
00:38:50,859 --> 00:38:52,592
After that, I was out for 3 days. 

1012
00:38:55,326 --> 00:38:56,926
You have to pay for the Black pork. 

1013
00:38:56,926 --> 00:38:58,692
- Okay. / - I think it will be delicious. 

1014
00:38:58,692 --> 00:38:59,926
I'll pay with the company card. 

1015
00:39:00,659 --> 00:39:02,826
(Unbelievable) 

1016
00:39:03,292 --> 00:39:05,792
(They're here to have pork!) 

1017
00:39:07,326 --> 00:39:10,159
(The flavors are enhanced with the coal briquettes) 

1018
00:39:10,659 --> 00:39:13,526
- Doesn't it look appetizing? / - It would be so good. 

1019
00:39:14,126 --> 00:39:15,226
I want to eat that again. 

1020
00:39:15,226 --> 00:39:17,059
You can't have this in Seoul. 

1021
00:39:17,059 --> 00:39:18,592
Briquettes are different. 

1022
00:39:19,026 --> 00:39:20,559
- It won't taste the same. / - Cooked like that. 

1023
00:39:20,559 --> 00:39:22,326
- Exactly. / - It's not the same. 

1024
00:39:22,326 --> 00:39:24,692
(This place adds more to the flavors of the meat) 

1025
00:39:25,859 --> 00:39:28,826
This pork barbecue joint has the best view in Jeju-do. 

1026
00:39:28,826 --> 00:39:30,792
Even though the weather is a bit cloudy, 

1027
00:39:30,792 --> 00:39:32,326
it's still beautiful. 

1028
00:39:32,326 --> 00:39:34,559
- It's a new scenery. / - We can open the windows. 

1029
00:39:34,926 --> 00:39:36,626
- The view there is amazing. / - Check out the ocean. 

1030
00:39:36,626 --> 00:39:37,926
You have to unlock it first. 

1031
00:39:38,359 --> 00:39:40,726
Come on. Unlock it first. You have to unlock it. 

1032
00:39:41,192 --> 00:39:42,459
- Unlock it. / - That's fine. 

1033
00:39:42,892 --> 00:39:44,526
Let's open it and close. 

1034
00:39:44,692 --> 00:39:46,326
(He still plays along though) 

1035
00:39:46,559 --> 00:39:47,692
Isn't this amazing? 

1036
00:39:47,692 --> 00:39:49,592
Although the weather wasn't great... 

1037
00:39:49,592 --> 00:39:52,292
- Personally, I really liked it. / - What a view. 

1038
00:39:52,292 --> 00:39:54,792
- The weather was great in its way. / - Precisely. 

1039
00:39:54,792 --> 00:39:57,226
- It looks rough with waves. / - What a nice place. 

1040
00:39:57,226 --> 00:39:58,959
(You're the best, Dongwan) 

1041
00:39:59,592 --> 00:40:01,726
- It looks really cool. / - I want to go back again. 

1042
00:40:01,726 --> 00:40:02,892
The pork looks different. 

1043
00:40:04,392 --> 00:40:07,359
I want to go too. 

1044
00:40:07,359 --> 00:40:08,026
(Jaw-dropping) 

1045
00:40:08,026 --> 00:40:09,026
- The color. / - Look how thick that is. 

1046
00:40:09,026 --> 00:40:10,659
- It's fresh meat. / - My gosh. 

1047
00:40:10,659 --> 00:40:14,026
They open from noon to 9:30 p.m. 

1048
00:40:14,726 --> 00:40:16,726
- You should start drinking early. / - We should go early. 

1049
00:40:16,726 --> 00:40:19,326
(2 servings of Black pork, $48) 

1050
00:40:19,859 --> 00:40:21,659
(Dongwan will grill the meat) 

1051
00:40:21,659 --> 00:40:23,026
I'm good at grilling meat. 

1052
00:40:26,126 --> 00:40:27,526
(Flip the meat after grilling one side) 

1053
00:40:28,259 --> 00:40:29,692
(Look at that) 

1054
00:40:29,692 --> 00:40:30,826
I'm not exaggerating. 

1055
00:40:30,826 --> 00:40:32,359
I haven't had anything like it in Seoul. 

1056
00:40:35,592 --> 00:40:36,859
Seriously. 

1057
00:40:37,659 --> 00:40:39,192
- He grilled it nicely. / - What will I do? 

1058
00:40:43,026 --> 00:40:44,592
(Cut the pork into bite-sized pieces) 

1059
00:40:44,592 --> 00:40:48,026
- I really love thick meat just like that. / - I want to go. 

1060
00:40:48,392 --> 00:40:50,692
- It's really juicy. / - Exactly. 

1061
00:40:52,392 --> 00:40:56,492
(Wait until they're completely cooked, and that's it) 

1062
00:40:57,359 --> 00:40:59,226
There you go. You're good at this. 

1063
00:40:59,226 --> 00:41:00,859
(You're doing a great job, Dongwan) 

1064
00:41:00,859 --> 00:41:03,759
I must compliment him so he does it all. 

1065
00:41:04,026 --> 00:41:05,859
- Then all he does is grill. / - That's true. 

1066
00:41:05,859 --> 00:41:07,759
(I knew you'd be great, Dongwan) 

1067
00:41:07,759 --> 00:41:08,926
- I didn't know you could do this. / - Hey. 

1068
00:41:08,926 --> 00:41:10,526
The briquettes are burning nicely. 

1069
00:41:10,526 --> 00:41:11,826
Look at the color. 

1070
00:41:13,626 --> 00:41:15,592
(They can't forget about the drinks during a barbecue) 

1071
00:41:16,226 --> 00:41:17,892
- There it is. / - Hallasan. 

1072
00:41:19,126 --> 00:41:22,159
That's the soju from Jeju-do. It's strong but soft. 

1073
00:41:22,159 --> 00:41:24,192
- Seriously. / - And besides, on top of the meat... 

1074
00:41:24,192 --> 00:41:25,259
You saw the view. 

1075
00:41:25,259 --> 00:41:26,426
- You can't get drunk. / - Listen. 

1076
00:41:26,426 --> 00:41:28,926
I'm a poor drinker but I wanted to drink. 

1077
00:41:28,926 --> 00:41:29,992
Right. 

1078
00:41:30,926 --> 00:41:33,059
Hey, hey. Hey. Come on. 

1079
00:41:33,059 --> 00:41:34,726
- Seriously. / - What? 

1080
00:41:35,792 --> 00:41:37,192
You don't know anything. 

1081
00:41:37,426 --> 00:41:39,392
- What are you going to do? / - Seriously. 

1082
00:41:39,859 --> 00:41:41,492
You don't know the first thing about drinking. 

1083
00:41:41,492 --> 00:41:43,459
(That's not how you open up a bottle of soju) 

1084
00:41:43,459 --> 00:41:45,559
Come on. What are you doing? 

1085
00:41:46,592 --> 00:41:47,926
- Dongwan. Let me. / - That was... 

1086
00:41:49,559 --> 00:41:51,192
- Stop it. / - Let me show you one thing. 

1087
00:41:51,326 --> 00:41:53,559
- People these days don't do that. / - Then what? 

1088
00:41:54,659 --> 00:41:57,659
Look at this. After doing this, this is how you do it. 

1089
00:41:57,659 --> 00:41:59,592
After doing this, this is how you do it. 

1090
00:41:59,592 --> 00:42:00,959
You open it in one go. 

1091
00:42:01,659 --> 00:42:03,626
(Is this how you do it?) 

1092
00:42:03,626 --> 00:42:05,459
How much must you drink to become like that? 

1093
00:42:06,292 --> 00:42:07,659
- Good job today. / - Thank you. 

1094
00:42:07,659 --> 00:42:11,659
(A shot of soju to acknowledge their hard work) 

1095
00:42:16,126 --> 00:42:18,426
(Meanwhile, the meat is getting cooked nicely) 

1096
00:42:18,426 --> 00:42:20,759
I bet the fatty parts are chewy. 

1097
00:42:20,759 --> 00:42:22,826
- What am I going to do? / - We overate that day. 

1098
00:42:22,826 --> 00:42:25,759
(Meanwhile, the meat is getting cooked nicely) 

1099
00:42:28,159 --> 00:42:30,792
- Dig in. / - Let me try the meat first. 

1100
00:42:31,092 --> 00:42:32,959
- Try it without the sauce. / - Just the pork. 

1101
00:42:38,426 --> 00:42:39,492
It's good? 

1102
00:42:41,626 --> 00:42:42,859
I was really surprised. 

1103
00:42:43,126 --> 00:42:45,159
- Was it really good? / - It was so good. 

1104
00:42:45,159 --> 00:42:45,726
This is like beef. 

1105
00:42:45,726 --> 00:42:47,592
Besides, Jeju Black Pigs are of... 

1106
00:42:47,592 --> 00:42:50,326
- The highest quality. It's tasty. / - That's right. 

1107
00:42:50,326 --> 00:42:51,992
- It's really delicious. / - This is like a beef steak. 

1108
00:42:51,992 --> 00:42:54,526
- Yes, this is like a steak. / - The pork... 

1109
00:42:54,526 --> 00:42:57,392
- Pork must taste like pork. / - Exactly. 

1110
00:42:57,459 --> 00:42:59,392
- It's weird if it tastes like beef. / - It's really tender. 

1111
00:42:59,392 --> 00:43:01,892
It tastes like pork, but this pork comes with 

1112
00:43:01,892 --> 00:43:03,359
all the things we like about beef. 

1113
00:43:05,292 --> 00:43:08,326
It's the pork I want to cook it to a medium rare. 

1114
00:43:08,826 --> 00:43:11,426
- It's tender. / - It has marbling like beef. 

1115
00:43:11,426 --> 00:43:13,192
Yeah, this is interesting. 

1116
00:43:13,192 --> 00:43:16,226
It's tender and juicy. 

1117
00:43:16,226 --> 00:43:19,126
It's meat, but it's crunchy. 

1118
00:43:19,126 --> 00:43:20,492
It is. 

1119
00:43:20,492 --> 00:43:22,159
I've never eaten something like this before. 

1120
00:43:23,026 --> 00:43:25,926
I've never expected much from pork but this... 

1121
00:43:27,592 --> 00:43:29,559
This makes me excited. 

1122
00:43:30,526 --> 00:43:32,759
(The Jeju Black Pig makes Dongwan excited) 

1123
00:43:32,759 --> 00:43:35,626
This is totally different from pork in Seoul. 

1124
00:43:35,626 --> 00:43:37,592
The pork rind and fat 

1125
00:43:37,592 --> 00:43:38,626
are different from those in Seoul. 

1126
00:43:38,626 --> 00:43:40,026
- It's totally different. / - It's so chewy. 

1127
00:43:40,359 --> 00:43:42,026
It's chewy and crispy. 

1128
00:43:42,026 --> 00:43:43,759
(Jeju-do is the only place where you can try this) 

1129
00:43:43,759 --> 00:43:45,792
It's good even with just salt. 

1130
00:43:46,392 --> 00:43:47,792
You have to dip it in salt-fermented anchovies. 

1131
00:43:47,792 --> 00:43:49,859
- Salt-fermented anchovies. / - You're right. 

1132
00:43:49,859 --> 00:43:52,959
You have to cook it on the grill and dip the meat in it. 

1133
00:43:52,959 --> 00:43:53,959
- You're right. / - She's right. 

1134
00:43:56,159 --> 00:43:58,759
I can't stand it anymore. 

1135
00:44:01,592 --> 00:44:04,092
A piece of meat 

1136
00:44:04,092 --> 00:44:05,392
makes you crave soju. 

1137
00:44:08,226 --> 00:44:09,759
Gosh. 

1138
00:44:11,926 --> 00:44:12,926
It's already served. 

1139
00:44:12,926 --> 00:44:14,559
(This is a must when you eat pork) 

1140
00:44:14,559 --> 00:44:16,492
It's kimchi stew. 

1141
00:44:17,026 --> 00:44:19,326
- Kimchi stew. / - It looks so delicious. 

1142
00:44:19,326 --> 00:44:21,526
This is so unfair. 

1143
00:44:21,792 --> 00:44:24,759
- It looks so delicious. / - It has Black pork in it too. 

1144
00:44:24,759 --> 00:44:26,859
- It's Black pork kimchi stew. / - Yes. 

1145
00:44:26,859 --> 00:44:28,726
- I prefer bean paste stew. / - Another bottle. 

1146
00:44:28,726 --> 00:44:29,726
Exactly. 

1147
00:44:30,192 --> 00:44:32,559
- JR prefers bean paste stew. / - I'm so hungry. 

1148
00:44:32,759 --> 00:44:34,926
(Kimchi stew) 

1149
00:44:41,426 --> 00:44:42,592
Look at the tofu. 

1150
00:44:44,659 --> 00:44:47,292
They make great kimchi stew. 

1151
00:44:48,492 --> 00:44:51,526
(He blows it to cool it down) 

1152
00:44:52,526 --> 00:44:54,459
(Mouth-watering) 

1153
00:44:54,459 --> 00:44:55,492
It looks delicious. 

1154
00:45:00,826 --> 00:45:02,192
This is amazing. 

1155
00:45:03,726 --> 00:45:05,326
- It's so good it makes me clap. / - It's really delicious. 

1156
00:45:10,526 --> 00:45:12,692
- Look at the color. / - The kimchi looks amazing. 

1157
00:45:13,426 --> 00:45:15,092
- JR, you look convinced again. / - Yes? 

1158
00:45:16,859 --> 00:45:19,526
You didn't know what you were doing just now, right? 

1159
00:45:20,192 --> 00:45:21,792
(Leaning forward) 

1160
00:45:21,792 --> 00:45:23,559
No, before you mentioned this, 

1161
00:45:23,559 --> 00:45:25,626
he said he preferred bean paste stew. 

1162
00:45:25,626 --> 00:45:27,492
I do prefer bean paste stew. 

1163
00:45:27,492 --> 00:45:29,026
But that kimchi looks delicious. 

1164
00:45:32,259 --> 00:45:39,092
(He mixes kimchi stew with rice) 

1165
00:45:42,992 --> 00:45:44,859
With radish. 

1166
00:45:50,526 --> 00:45:51,759
(They're amazed by its wonderful taste) 

1167
00:45:51,759 --> 00:45:53,259
The flavors are deliciously combined. 

1168
00:45:55,692 --> 00:45:57,892
(They know) 

1169
00:45:57,892 --> 00:46:02,226
(How to make proper wraps) 

1170
00:46:10,726 --> 00:46:12,092
(It's the best) 

1171
00:46:12,092 --> 00:46:13,726
It must be really delicious. 

1172
00:46:14,526 --> 00:46:17,126
(Play Day is already over) 

1173
00:46:17,126 --> 00:46:19,759
- That restaurant is pretty. / - It's a pretty restaurant. 

1174
00:46:19,759 --> 00:46:21,926
Jin, it's not over. 

1175
00:46:22,959 --> 00:46:23,759
Weren't we going to wrap it up? 

1176
00:46:23,759 --> 00:46:25,126
There's one more place. 

1177
00:46:25,126 --> 00:46:26,426
Why are we going to so many places? 

1178
00:46:26,426 --> 00:46:28,326
Everything closes early in Jeju-do, 

1179
00:46:28,326 --> 00:46:30,792
but there's a great place that doesn't close early. 

1180
00:46:30,792 --> 00:46:32,892
Let's go drink one cocktail and then wrap it up. 

1181
00:46:33,026 --> 00:46:34,092
Let's go. 

1182
00:46:34,626 --> 00:46:35,892
Finish it up. Let's hurry. 

1183
00:46:37,392 --> 00:46:40,259
There isn't night life in Seogwipo as far as I know. 

1184
00:46:40,959 --> 00:46:41,759
(That's not true at all) 

1185
00:46:41,759 --> 00:46:43,626
- I thought so too. / - There isn't anything. 

1186
00:46:43,626 --> 00:46:45,192
But Dongwan found something. 

1187
00:46:45,592 --> 00:46:48,926
(It's in Jungmun, Seogwipo) 

1188
00:46:48,926 --> 00:46:50,759
Most of the tourists there are families. 

1189
00:46:50,759 --> 00:46:53,959
If you look up on video streaming sites, 

1190
00:46:53,959 --> 00:46:55,959
foreigners recommend this spot a lot. 

1191
00:46:55,959 --> 00:46:57,626
- This is Jeju-do? / - Yes. 

1192
00:46:58,092 --> 00:46:59,426
The waves here are small 

1193
00:46:59,426 --> 00:47:02,159
and the beach has an exotic view. 

1194
00:47:02,159 --> 00:47:04,792
It's popular among foreign surfers at night. 

1195
00:47:04,792 --> 00:47:08,192
We're going to blaze up the night tonight. 

1196
00:47:08,359 --> 00:47:09,959
There's no hot place in Jeju-do. 

1197
00:47:09,959 --> 00:47:12,192
- This place looks so exotic. / - This is where... 

1198
00:47:12,459 --> 00:47:17,459
- They tried to make it like Hawaii. / - Did they? 

1199
00:47:17,459 --> 00:47:20,259
There's a fascinating spot in such a far 

1200
00:47:20,259 --> 00:47:21,859
and quiet place. 

1201
00:47:21,859 --> 00:47:23,626
- I've never heard of it. / - Follow me. 

1202
00:47:23,626 --> 00:47:24,826
Let's have a hot night.

- What's all this? / - What is this? 

1206
00:47:32,859 --> 00:47:33,926
I was really surprised. 

1207
00:47:33,926 --> 00:47:36,326
You can play darts and billiards there as well. 

1208
00:47:36,326 --> 00:47:39,059
There's a club lounge, an outdoor lounge. 

1209
00:47:39,059 --> 00:47:40,826
- And even a swimming pool. / - That's amazing. 

1210
00:47:40,859 --> 00:47:42,726
It's located at Saekdal Beach. 

1211
00:47:42,726 --> 00:47:43,626
Wan Jun Tour is amazing. 

1212
00:47:43,626 --> 00:47:45,659
I visit Jeju-do often but I've never been 

1213
00:47:45,659 --> 00:47:47,126
to the places you've been. 

1214
00:47:47,426 --> 00:47:48,959
I've never been to any of them. 

1215
00:47:48,959 --> 00:47:51,626
I'm sure this place would have been more crowded 

1216
00:47:51,626 --> 00:47:52,759
if the weather was nicer. 

1217
00:47:52,759 --> 00:47:54,292
- Stand on this line. / - Dart! 

1218
00:47:54,292 --> 00:47:55,292
There you go.

1220
00:47:59,326 --> 00:48:01,559
Come on. Just throw it.

(Dancing) 

1224
00:48:16,959 --> 00:48:20,159
(Seogwipo's hot night is over) 

1225
00:48:20,159 --> 00:48:21,926
It's really nice here. 

1226
00:48:23,626 --> 00:48:30,659
(Their hectic first day is almost over now) 

1227
00:48:32,492 --> 00:48:33,926
I prepared so many things 

1228
00:48:33,926 --> 00:48:35,326
but the weather wasn't very good. 

1229
00:48:35,326 --> 00:48:36,859
- Although the weather was bad... / - We did a lot. 

1230
00:48:36,859 --> 00:48:39,792
Just being here with you makes me happy. 

1231
00:48:39,792 --> 00:48:41,359
You prepared a lot 

1232
00:48:41,359 --> 00:48:42,959
and that's meaningful to me. 

1233
00:48:42,959 --> 00:48:44,126
- Did you like it? / - Yes. 

1234
00:48:44,426 --> 00:48:46,959
It was the first time we traveled just the two of us. 

1235
00:48:46,959 --> 00:48:48,526
It was your first time traveling together in 20 years? 

1236
00:48:48,526 --> 00:48:51,392
- Yes, just us two. / - So it was very meaningful to me. 

1237
00:48:51,726 --> 00:48:53,192
I want to come back when the weather is nice. 

1238
00:48:53,192 --> 00:48:54,826
I'll come back here later and get wasted. 

1239
00:48:56,726 --> 00:48:58,592

- But we have a plan for tomorrow. / - Tomorrow... 

1241
00:49:01,359 --> 00:49:02,226
According to the weather forecast, 

1242
00:49:02,226 --> 00:49:03,392
it's going to be sunny tomorrow. 

1243
00:49:03,392 --> 00:49:04,792
- The weather didn't help me today. / - Actually... 

1244
00:49:04,792 --> 00:49:06,759
The weather depends on the person. 

1245
00:49:06,759 --> 00:49:10,392
Just follow me tomorrow. 

1246
00:49:10,659 --> 00:49:13,626
I prepared good restaurants and fun places.

1248

(Should we dance at least?) 

1251
00:49:22,092 --> 00:49:23,759
So that's the crazy night? 

1252
00:49:23,759 --> 00:49:24,759

You and I are very different.

It was a dream come true.

You can't get seafood like this in Seoul.

00:54:01,326 --> 00:54:04,692
(They want to drive while listening to music) 

1364
00:54:04,826 --> 00:54:06,592
Okay. 

1365
00:54:07,726 --> 00:54:10,359
("Kiss Me Like That" from their 20th anniversary album) 

1366
00:54:10,359 --> 00:54:12,026
This is our new song. 

1367
00:54:17,159 --> 00:54:19,459
(They dance together) 

1368
00:54:28,626 --> 00:54:31,326
(They just can't sit still even for a minute) 

1369
00:54:32,392 --> 00:54:34,426
I've never seen him so excited before. 

1370
00:54:35,826 --> 00:54:38,226
It must've felt great to drive there 

1371
00:54:38,226 --> 00:54:39,126
listening to your new song. 

1372
00:54:39,126 --> 00:54:40,359
- It was great. / - Yes. 

1373
00:54:40,359 --> 00:54:41,559
(The music turns the road into a flowery path) 

1374
00:54:41,559 --> 00:54:43,859
We couldn't do anything special... 

1375
00:54:44,359 --> 00:54:45,659
Because of the weather yesterday. 

1376
00:54:45,659 --> 00:54:46,392
So let's take a photo. 

1377
00:54:46,592 --> 00:54:49,192
I want to take a picture with the sea. 

1378
00:54:50,226 --> 00:54:51,692
It's totally different from the first day. 

1379
00:54:51,692 --> 00:54:55,059
Going for a drive in a convertible is a really good idea. 

1380
00:54:55,059 --> 00:54:56,192
Thank you. 

1381
00:54:56,826 --> 00:54:58,926
- We haven't taken a picture yet. / - Right. 

1382
00:54:58,992 --> 00:55:00,459
(Jun Jin wants to remember his wish with a picture) 

1383
00:55:00,459 --> 00:55:02,259
- Let's take a picture. / - Alright. 

1384
00:55:05,292 --> 00:55:06,926
1, 2, and 3. 

1385
00:55:07,759 --> 00:55:10,626
(We are SHINHWA) 

1386
00:55:10,626 --> 00:55:12,526
You must've missed the other members. 

1387
00:55:12,526 --> 00:55:14,359
- Sure, I wished they were there. / - Exactly. 

1388
00:55:14,526 --> 00:55:16,126
They are a special group. 

1389
00:55:16,126 --> 00:55:19,626
They've been close friends for such a long time. 

1390
00:55:19,626 --> 00:55:21,526
- Isn't it amazing? / - It really is. 

1391
00:55:21,526 --> 00:55:22,659
We're here. 

1392
00:55:23,492 --> 00:55:26,259
(Where is Wan Jun Tour going?) 

1393
00:55:26,526 --> 00:55:27,792
The sea breeze. 

1394
00:55:27,792 --> 00:55:29,092
The weather is much better than yesterday. 

1395
00:55:30,126 --> 00:55:31,926
We haven't eaten yet. 

1396
00:55:32,126 --> 00:55:34,826
There's a very good restaurant around here. 

1397
00:55:35,226 --> 00:55:37,192
Only the local residents know this place. 

1398
00:55:37,292 --> 00:55:39,192
I have a hidden card. Wait a second. 

1399
00:55:40,392 --> 00:55:42,892
I prepared this when you were asleep. 

1400
00:55:43,726 --> 00:55:44,959
Did he prepare balloons? 

1401
00:55:46,492 --> 00:55:47,826
Oh, my God. 

1402
00:55:48,626 --> 00:55:49,559
He's a master of big reactions. 

1403
00:55:49,559 --> 00:55:50,459
How does "Eusha! Eusha!" go? 

1404
00:55:50,459 --> 00:55:52,492
♪ I like watermelon better ♪ 

1405
00:55:53,359 --> 00:55:54,592
Good, good. 

1406
00:55:54,592 --> 00:55:55,792
(Good job) 

1407
00:55:57,126 --> 00:55:59,192
(Why do they need a watermelon?) 

1408
00:55:59,392 --> 00:56:00,492
Playing in the water? 

1409
00:56:00,492 --> 00:56:02,059
- Is it a mountain stream? / - This is nice. 

1410
00:56:02,092 --> 00:56:03,226
Look at that. 

1411
00:56:03,859 --> 00:56:04,926
Be careful. 

1412
00:56:07,059 --> 00:56:09,859
What? Jin, the water goes to the sea. 

1413
00:56:11,759 --> 00:56:13,759
(The place has become increasingly popular) 

1414
00:56:13,759 --> 00:56:16,492
(Gangjeongcheon in Seogwipo) 

1415
00:56:18,626 --> 00:56:19,959
(The new tourist spot in Seogwipo) 

1416
00:56:19,959 --> 00:56:21,559
When people come to Jeju-do, 

1417
00:56:21,559 --> 00:56:25,026
they mostly visit the beaches and famous resorts. 

1418
00:56:25,026 --> 00:56:27,859
If you want to visit some place new during your trip, 

1419
00:56:27,859 --> 00:56:29,026
you should come here. 

1420
00:56:29,192 --> 00:56:30,726
The river flows into the sea? 

1421
00:56:30,726 --> 00:56:31,859
Yes, the river and sea join there. 

1422
00:56:31,859 --> 00:56:33,859
- The sea is right next to it. / - The sea is right there. 

1423
00:56:34,692 --> 00:56:36,926
They are only open from June to August. 

1424
00:56:36,926 --> 00:56:38,559
That's amazing. 

1425
00:56:39,692 --> 00:56:42,359
- The freshwater becomes seawater. / - That's right. 

1426
00:56:42,559 --> 00:56:44,559
- I soaked my feet earlier. / - Isn't it cool? 

1427
00:56:44,559 --> 00:56:46,092
- It's cold. / - I know. 

1428
00:56:46,092 --> 00:56:49,359
It's colder than the water from a fridge. 

1429
00:56:49,526 --> 00:56:51,226
- It must be cool. / - It was so cool. 

1430
00:56:51,526 --> 00:56:55,526
(They can taste Korean chicken soup there) 

1431
00:56:56,826 --> 00:56:58,992
It's Korean chicken. 

1432
00:56:59,792 --> 00:57:01,492
Is it because I'm a middle-aged man? 

1433
00:57:01,492 --> 00:57:03,192
I like that place the most so far. 

1434
00:57:03,726 --> 00:57:04,859
- I want to be there. / - I know. 

1435
00:57:04,859 --> 00:57:06,059
If you want to drink during the day, 

1436
00:57:06,059 --> 00:57:07,526
this is a good place for that. 

1437
00:57:07,726 --> 00:57:08,892
That's it. 

1438
00:57:08,892 --> 00:57:10,392
They eat cuttlefish. 

1439
00:57:10,392 --> 00:57:14,892
(It's made with cuttlefish from Seogwipo) 

1440
00:57:16,959 --> 00:57:18,526
That's hard to beat. Did you eat anything good? 

1441
00:57:18,526 --> 00:57:20,159
We did. 

1442
00:57:20,159 --> 00:57:21,926
- This looks good though. / - It melts in your mouth. 

1443
00:57:22,059 --> 00:57:24,259
Baekho is getting weak. 

1444
00:57:24,259 --> 00:57:25,259
No, we also had good food. 

1445
00:57:25,492 --> 00:57:26,892
We had great dishes too. 

1446
00:57:26,892 --> 00:57:28,192
(Cuttlefish instant noodles, $20) 

1447
00:57:28,959 --> 00:57:31,259
Normal boiled chicken is just this. 

1448
00:57:31,559 --> 00:57:34,259
But if you have a lot of soup... 

1449
00:57:35,059 --> 00:57:37,359
We can order chicken soup like this. 

1450
00:57:37,359 --> 00:57:39,426
We can make porridge with the soup. 

1451
00:57:39,426 --> 00:57:41,726
We can also cook instant noodles with it if we want. 

1452
00:57:41,726 --> 00:57:43,426
- It's soup instant noodles. / - That's right. 

1453
00:57:44,059 --> 00:57:46,059
(They start eating the dish) 

1454
00:57:46,059 --> 00:57:47,126
This is amazing. 

1455
00:57:47,726 --> 00:57:49,959
(It's overwhelming) 

1456
00:57:49,959 --> 00:57:51,926
I guess we should eat it with this. 

1457
00:57:51,926 --> 00:57:53,726
Look at the chicken. 

1458
00:57:53,726 --> 00:57:55,126
I haven't seen such a chicken in a while. 

1459
00:57:55,126 --> 00:57:56,026
Check out this drumstick. 

1460
00:57:56,026 --> 00:57:58,592
(It looks big and chewy) 

1461
00:58:02,559 --> 00:58:04,426
It's Korean chicken but it's very tender. 

1462
00:58:05,026 --> 00:58:06,559
And it doesn't have a bad odor. 

1463
00:58:07,026 --> 00:58:08,292
Chickens from Jeju-do are different. 

1464
00:58:08,292 --> 00:58:09,792
You should eat the skin. 

1465
00:58:09,792 --> 00:58:11,326
Dongwan doesn't like boiled chicken. 

1466
00:58:11,326 --> 00:58:12,759
I actually hate it. 

1467
00:58:13,026 --> 00:58:14,159
You hate that too? 

1468
00:58:14,159 --> 00:58:16,492
It's like the water chicken took a bath in. 

1469
00:58:17,159 --> 00:58:20,126
He says it's like drinking the bathwater of a chicken. 

1470
00:58:20,126 --> 00:58:21,492
Are you talking about the milky soup? 

1471
00:58:21,492 --> 00:58:23,659
- But this was really good. / - This is good for health. 

1472
00:58:23,659 --> 00:58:25,559
I didn't get to eat ginseng chicken soup this summer. 

1473
00:58:25,559 --> 00:58:26,759
I didn't have a chance. 

1474
00:58:26,759 --> 00:58:28,392
- He really liked it. / - Are you sure you hate it? 

1475
00:58:28,592 --> 00:58:30,826
- That chicken was so good. / - He's eating so well. 

1476
00:58:30,826 --> 00:58:32,426
He doesn't seem to hate it at all. 

1477
00:58:32,426 --> 00:58:33,959
It's the first time I've seen him like this in 20 years. 

1478
00:58:33,959 --> 00:58:35,992
He'd even eat the chicken bones. 

1479
00:58:35,992 --> 00:58:37,492
(He just keeps eating no matter what Jun Jin says) 

1480
00:58:37,592 --> 00:58:38,859
I like fried chicken though. 

1481
00:58:39,559 --> 00:58:40,992
- This is good. / - I know. 

1482
00:58:41,559 --> 00:58:43,659
If you don't like ginseng chicken soup... 

1483
00:58:43,659 --> 00:58:44,726
I don't like ginseng chicken soup. 

1484
00:58:44,726 --> 00:58:45,992
But you're eating so well. 

1485
00:58:45,992 --> 00:58:47,226
He says one thing and does another. 

1486
00:58:47,492 --> 00:58:49,626
Everyone would love this. 

1487
00:58:49,626 --> 00:58:51,926
(He's proud of his choice of menu) 

1488
00:58:54,426 --> 00:58:56,559
(Even Dongwan who doesn't like chicken loves this) 

1489
00:58:56,559 --> 00:58:59,226
I've never seen you enjoy a chicken dish like this. 

1490
00:59:02,392 --> 00:59:04,926
(Taste of clean ingredients without special seasoning) 

1491
00:59:04,926 --> 00:59:07,792
I'm getting old, so I love places like that. 

1492
00:59:11,392 --> 00:59:14,492
It feels even better with the sea breeze. 

1493
00:59:14,492 --> 00:59:16,259
It makes the dish taste better. 

1494
00:59:16,426 --> 00:59:18,059
- This is so much better than yesterday. / - Yeah. 

1495
00:59:18,059 --> 00:59:24,426
(It feels more special because they're together) 

1496
00:59:25,426 --> 00:59:26,692
I want to go there. 

1497
00:59:26,692 --> 00:59:28,626
Jun Jin came up with an amazing course. 

1498
00:59:28,626 --> 00:59:30,026
It was so delicious. 

1499
00:59:30,026 --> 00:59:31,292
It's making me tear up. 

1500
00:59:32,859 --> 00:59:34,626
Now we should try this instant noodles. 

1501
00:59:34,626 --> 00:59:36,026
It looks really good. 

1502
00:59:36,392 --> 00:59:37,926
- I'm hungry. / - It looks good. 

1503
00:59:37,926 --> 00:59:39,059
(It's time to try cuttlefish instant noodles now) 

1504
00:59:40,459 --> 00:59:41,992
I'll eat it like Lee Byunghun. 

1505
00:59:42,292 --> 00:59:43,459
How? 

1506
00:59:44,726 --> 00:59:45,926
Like Lee Byunghun. 

1507
00:59:46,592 --> 00:59:47,892
From his movie. 

1508
00:59:47,892 --> 00:59:50,226
Like Lee Byunghun from "Inside Men?" 

1509
00:59:51,059 --> 00:59:52,359
Like "Inside Men." 

1510
00:59:53,626 --> 00:59:57,392
(He's possessed by Lee Byunghun) 

1511
01:00:01,259 --> 01:00:02,892
- It's like a scene from a drama. / - That's similar. 

1512
01:00:02,892 --> 01:00:04,859
He's a good actor. 

1513
01:00:08,926 --> 01:00:10,159
Didn't he eat it like that in the movie? 

1514
01:00:10,159 --> 01:00:12,392
- You made us laugh. / - Right, he spat it out once. 

1515
01:00:12,392 --> 01:00:14,592
- That's right. / - He did the same thing. 

1516
01:00:14,592 --> 01:00:15,959
(He's a good actor who cares about the details) 

1517
01:00:17,859 --> 01:00:20,959
- Didn't he do this? / - Yeah, he did. 

1518
01:00:20,959 --> 01:00:21,492
(He sounds serious) 

1519
01:00:24,892 --> 01:00:26,859
(Dongwan stops making jokes and tastes it seriously) 

1520
01:00:26,859 --> 01:00:28,059
I can taste the cuttlefish. 

1521
01:00:32,426 --> 01:00:34,259
(It's delicious) 

1522
01:00:35,392 --> 01:00:37,959
The cuttlefish is in season now in Jeju-do. 

1523
01:00:37,959 --> 01:00:40,126
The cuttlefish looks so fresh. 

1524
01:00:40,126 --> 01:00:41,692
It has a lot of cuttlefish in it. 

1525
01:00:42,492 --> 01:00:44,826
The fresh taste of cuttlefish... 

1526
01:00:44,826 --> 01:00:46,559
Flavors the soup. 

1527
01:00:47,626 --> 01:00:49,326
It tastes so fresh. 

1528
01:00:49,959 --> 01:00:51,259
It's fresh instant noodles. 

1529
01:00:51,259 --> 01:00:52,459
Well... 

1530
01:00:52,592 --> 01:00:54,226
JR, you're leaning forward too much. 

1531
01:00:54,226 --> 01:00:55,592
No, that's not true. 

1532
01:00:55,592 --> 01:00:57,559
JR, you might get turtle neck syndrome. 

1533
01:00:57,559 --> 01:00:59,059
You're leaning forward a lot. 

1534
01:00:59,192 --> 01:01:00,359
It's funny though. 

1535
01:01:00,359 --> 01:01:00,959
The viewer ratings go up 

1536
01:01:00,959 --> 01:01:02,592
when instant noodles is aired. 

1537
01:01:03,026 --> 01:01:05,226
Instant noodles and fried chicken. 

1538
01:01:05,226 --> 01:01:06,692
It makes you cook some. 

1539
01:01:06,692 --> 01:01:08,826
That's because they know what it tastes like. 

1540
01:01:09,392 --> 01:01:11,459
It has the deep taste. 

1541
01:01:20,092 --> 01:01:23,359
(Refreshing) 

1542
01:01:23,926 --> 01:01:25,326
Let's try one more bite. 

1543
01:01:26,126 --> 01:01:27,659
Can you play in the water? 

1544
01:01:27,659 --> 01:01:28,892
- Sure. / - Of course. 

1545
01:01:28,892 --> 01:01:30,859
The water is pretty deep, 

1546
01:01:30,859 --> 01:01:32,159
so you can swim in there. 

1547
01:01:32,159 --> 01:01:33,692
I've never seen that before. 

1548
01:01:34,592 --> 01:01:37,392
I put it in water about 20 minutes ago, but it's cold. 

1549
01:01:38,126 --> 01:01:39,359
- Is it cold? / - Yes. 

1550
01:01:40,459 --> 01:01:42,226
Jin, break it like this. 

1551
01:01:43,726 --> 01:01:45,659
Let's shoot it with a high speed camera. 

1552
01:01:46,092 --> 01:01:47,659
- I won't hit it hard. / - Okay. 

1553
01:01:49,559 --> 01:01:51,692
(The watermelon cracks in one hit) 

1554
01:01:51,692 --> 01:01:52,792
- Is this filmed with high speed camera? / - What? 

1555
01:01:54,592 --> 01:01:55,592
It broke so easily. 

1556
01:01:55,592 --> 01:01:56,959
That's because it's so ripe. 

1557
01:01:57,026 --> 01:01:58,626
- You want to cut it like that? / - Yes. 

1558
01:01:59,592 --> 01:02:02,992
It feels so good to eat chicken and watermelon 

1559
01:02:02,992 --> 01:02:06,259
listening to the sound of water at a mountain stream. 

1560
01:02:06,792 --> 01:02:07,892
It's cold. 

1561
01:02:08,492 --> 01:02:09,626
Is it really cold? 

1562
01:02:09,926 --> 01:02:12,092
I like the sound of running water. 

1563
01:02:12,092 --> 01:02:13,892
The sound... 

1564
01:02:14,226 --> 01:02:15,559
Stimulate your appetite. 

1565
01:02:16,192 --> 01:02:18,326
They eat instant noodles and watermelon after playing. 

1566
01:02:18,326 --> 01:02:22,092
We had a busy day yesterday. 

1567
01:02:22,692 --> 01:02:25,659
So I wanted to relax and get some rest today. 

1568
01:02:25,659 --> 01:02:27,226
Today is Relax Day. 

1569
01:02:27,859 --> 01:02:30,059
We get a good rest on this trip. 

1570
01:02:30,059 --> 01:02:32,192
It'd be great to go there with family. 

1571
01:02:32,192 --> 01:02:34,359
- It sounds wonderful. / - And the food was really good. 

1572
01:02:34,359 --> 01:02:36,226
I'll be sure to go there next year. 

1573
01:02:36,226 --> 01:02:37,359
It's Gangjeongcheon. 

1574
01:02:37,359 --> 01:02:39,492
- Your children will love it. / - You should sleep now. 

1575
01:02:39,492 --> 01:02:40,792
It's time to take a nap. 

1576
01:02:41,559 --> 01:02:42,259
That's perfect. 

1577
01:02:42,726 --> 01:02:43,692
Remove the table and take a nap. 

1578
01:02:44,359 --> 01:02:45,759
The sound of water was so nice. 

1579
01:02:45,759 --> 01:02:47,092
(They feel sleepy after having a big lunch) 

1580
01:02:47,092 --> 01:02:48,392
It looks amazing. 

1581
01:02:48,926 --> 01:02:49,959
I want to rest... 

1582
01:02:50,359 --> 01:02:52,359
Listening to the sound of running water. 

1583
01:02:52,959 --> 01:02:54,359
Okay. Let's do that. 

1584
01:02:54,926 --> 01:02:56,492
(Listening to the sound of nature) 

1585
01:02:56,492 --> 01:02:57,892
It will relieve our stress. 

1586
01:03:00,292 --> 01:03:01,426
Jin, I'll go... 

1587
01:03:01,859 --> 01:03:03,092
Enjoy the water properly. 

1588
01:03:03,859 --> 01:03:05,059
(Shouting) 

1589
01:03:05,059 --> 01:03:07,426
It's so cold. 

1590
01:03:10,359 --> 01:03:13,292
(I am Kim Dongwan) 

1591
01:03:15,092 --> 01:03:15,926
(Pleased) 

1592
01:03:16,192 --> 01:03:18,126
(I am Kim Dongwan) 

1593
01:03:19,526 --> 01:03:20,859
(The Idols that made the hearts of teenage fans race) 

1594
01:03:20,859 --> 01:03:23,459
Out of the blue. 

1595
01:03:26,559 --> 01:03:28,126
They made me look good in that clip. 

1596
01:03:29,126 --> 01:03:30,226
That's nice. 

1597
01:03:30,226 --> 01:03:32,192
(This is the charm of an adult) 

1598
01:03:36,559 --> 01:03:38,126
The water... 

1599
01:03:38,126 --> 01:03:40,792
- Was it that cold? / - It was really cold. 

1600
01:03:40,792 --> 01:03:42,559
(You have to dog paddle when you're in a stream) 

1601
01:03:42,559 --> 01:03:43,759
It's deep. 

1602
01:03:45,392 --> 01:03:47,926
- It must be deep. / - It is deep. 

1603
01:03:47,926 --> 01:03:50,259
- Look how clean the water is. / - It's really deep. 

1604
01:03:50,259 --> 01:03:52,259
- It's deep. / - There are even fish. 

1605
01:03:53,492 --> 01:03:55,526
The water is really clean here. 

1606
01:03:56,359 --> 01:03:58,959
The water tastes good. 

1607
01:03:58,959 --> 01:04:01,526
It's because you're thirsty. You tried too hard. 

1608
01:04:03,459 --> 01:04:06,392
(He will start playing in the water for real now) 

1609
01:04:07,826 --> 01:04:09,292
- Jun Jin, didn't you go in? / - No. 

1610
01:04:09,292 --> 01:04:11,826
I really wanted to move to the next location. 

1611
01:04:15,192 --> 01:04:16,192
(His face looks like a gold medalist in diving) 

1612
01:04:18,559 --> 01:04:22,059
(He dives into the water without hesitation) 

1613
01:04:22,792 --> 01:04:24,559
You didn't dive. You just came down. 

1614
01:04:26,459 --> 01:04:28,326
We have a lot to do today. 

1615
01:04:29,326 --> 01:04:33,092
(Doesn't listen) 

1616
01:04:33,092 --> 01:04:35,126
He played like that alone for over an hour. 

1617
01:04:35,126 --> 01:04:36,126
(Dongwan played like that for some time) 

1618
01:04:36,126 --> 01:04:38,192
Because he missed out on Seonnyeotang. 

1619
01:04:38,459 --> 01:04:42,059
Dongwan likes water, so he will want to play in it. 

1620
01:04:42,059 --> 01:04:44,726
That's too boring. 

1621
01:04:44,726 --> 01:04:46,492
I want to do something else than swimming 

1622
01:04:46,492 --> 01:04:47,692
like horse riding. 

1623
01:04:48,259 --> 01:04:49,526
Horse riding? 

1624
01:04:49,526 --> 01:04:51,759
I want to go horse riding in a meadow. 

1625
01:04:52,292 --> 01:04:54,192
You like to ride things in general. 

1626
01:04:54,492 --> 01:04:56,192
- Like sports cars... / - It's different. 

1627
01:04:56,426 --> 01:05:00,226
- Horses. / - I want to ride a car by the sea... 

1628
01:05:00,726 --> 01:05:02,626
And ride a horse in a meadow. 

1629
01:05:02,992 --> 01:05:04,626
You see it in movies and dramas. 

1630
01:05:04,626 --> 01:05:05,592
They always have a scene. 

1631
01:05:06,126 --> 01:05:07,459
I'm afraid of horses. 

1632
01:05:07,792 --> 01:05:09,059
I bet he'll really enjoy it. 

1633
01:05:09,392 --> 01:05:10,259
- You also hate horses? / - No... 

1634
01:05:10,259 --> 01:05:10,992
I really can't ride horses. 

1635
01:05:10,992 --> 01:05:12,926
You said you didn't like ginseng chicken soup. 

1636
01:05:12,926 --> 01:05:14,392
What do you like then? 

1637
01:05:14,392 --> 01:05:15,559
- That's right. / - Yes. 

1638
01:05:15,559 --> 01:05:17,092
- He was like that. / - Look at him eat. 

1639
01:05:17,092 --> 01:05:18,559
I'm really scared of horses. 

1640
01:05:19,526 --> 01:05:23,392
(They move by car for 60 minutes for horse riding) 

1641
01:05:25,559 --> 01:05:29,092
(The sky of Seogwipo is getting clearer) 

1642
01:05:30,026 --> 01:05:32,059
Think about riding horses in this meadow. 

1643
01:05:32,892 --> 01:05:35,092
(Will they ride horses in the meadow?) 

1644
01:05:35,992 --> 01:05:38,292
(When you think of Jeju-do, you think of horses) 

1645
01:05:38,292 --> 01:05:41,026
(When you think of horses, you think of Jeju-do) 

1646
01:05:41,692 --> 01:05:42,559
Jeju-do horses. 

1647
01:05:46,226 --> 01:05:49,659
(A special horse riding you can enjoy in Seogwipo) 

1648
01:05:50,426 --> 01:05:53,092
(You can go around the vast meadow) 

1649
01:05:53,492 --> 01:05:57,292
The meadow meets the sea. 

1650
01:06:02,426 --> 01:06:06,992
(A special horse riding experience) 

1651
01:06:07,459 --> 01:06:10,426
(That will make Jun Jin's wish come true) 

1652
01:06:10,426 --> 01:06:11,559
- Hello. / - Hello. 

1653
01:06:12,959 --> 01:06:15,026
I really wanted 

1654
01:06:15,026 --> 01:06:17,892
to ride horses in Jeju-do. 

1655
01:06:17,892 --> 01:06:20,292
- I want to ride them in the meadow. / - I see. 

1656
01:06:20,426 --> 01:06:21,526
It's my first time. 

1657
01:06:21,526 --> 01:06:22,726
- You'll have to... / - Yes. 

1658
01:06:22,726 --> 01:06:25,526
- Get changed first. / - Get changed? 

1659
01:06:26,026 --> 01:06:28,126
- Safety's the most important thing. / - Okay. 

1660
01:06:28,126 --> 01:06:30,292
- We'll start after that. / - Okay. 

1661
01:06:30,792 --> 01:06:32,292
Take your hats off. 

1662
01:06:32,392 --> 01:06:33,759
- Do we have to wear that? / - How about our pants? 

1663
01:06:34,492 --> 01:06:35,559
Yes. 

1664
01:06:36,226 --> 01:06:37,859
It suits my outfit perfectly. 

1665
01:06:38,126 --> 01:06:39,692
It looks good. 

1666
01:06:39,959 --> 01:06:42,659
- Jun Jin, do you like horses? / - Yes, I rode a lot. 

1667
01:06:43,392 --> 01:06:44,692
- Oh, my. / - So cool. 

1668
01:06:44,692 --> 01:06:46,792
They look handsome. 

1669
01:06:47,592 --> 01:06:50,226
- They're all retired racehorses. / - That's right. 

1670
01:06:50,226 --> 01:06:51,492
(You can tell he's happy from his shoulders) 

1671
01:06:51,492 --> 01:06:54,826
He's also a racehorse that has raced for 20 years. 

1672
01:06:56,126 --> 01:06:58,426
- He raced a lot. / - Yes. 

1673
01:07:01,092 --> 01:07:03,359
- The taller person should get on him. / - Okay. 

1674
01:07:03,359 --> 01:07:04,426
Is it $20? 

1675
01:07:04,992 --> 01:07:07,892
(Its sparkly eyes are charming) 

1676
01:07:09,026 --> 01:07:10,326
(The remarkably sturdy muscles are its strong point) 

1677
01:07:10,326 --> 01:07:11,992
It's handsome. 

1678
01:07:12,826 --> 01:07:13,859
Come here. 

1679
01:07:13,859 --> 01:07:16,559
(Dongwan tries to commune with the horse first) 

1680
01:07:17,792 --> 01:07:20,026
Let's ride together. Selfie. 

1681
01:07:21,492 --> 01:07:22,792
Let's take a selfie. 

1682
01:07:22,792 --> 01:07:24,559
(Let's have fun while riding) 

1683
01:07:24,559 --> 01:07:25,759
You're so nice. 

1684
01:07:27,326 --> 01:07:30,392
(They get on the horses safely) 

1685
01:07:31,159 --> 01:07:32,759
(First, they ride in here to get used to it) 

1686
01:07:32,759 --> 01:07:34,659
You can ride in the paddock 

1687
01:07:34,659 --> 01:07:37,892
and then go around the vast meadow. 

1688
01:07:37,892 --> 01:07:41,259
They usually make you only ride on 

1689
01:07:41,259 --> 01:07:43,092
the small path that they made. 

1690
01:07:43,092 --> 01:07:45,259
You can go a couple of rounds in there, 

1691
01:07:45,259 --> 01:07:46,959
and when you're familiar with the horse... 

1692
01:07:46,959 --> 01:07:48,259
- You hit the meadow. / - You go out to the meadow. 

1693
01:07:48,259 --> 01:07:49,559
- Yes. / - That's right. 

1694
01:07:51,526 --> 01:07:54,726
(Fantastic horse riding where you can see the sea) 

1695
01:07:56,926 --> 01:08:00,426
(The moment when Jun Jin's wish comes true) 

1696
01:08:00,826 --> 01:08:01,926
It feels so good. 

1697
01:08:01,926 --> 01:08:04,059
(It feels so good) 

1698
01:08:04,059 --> 01:08:05,826
- I really wanted to try this. / - That'd be really nice. 

1699
01:08:05,826 --> 01:08:08,559
- Kids will love that. / - Dongwan is also enjoying it... 

1700
01:08:08,559 --> 01:08:11,326
- When he's riding it. / - I was nervous while riding. 

1701
01:08:11,892 --> 01:08:14,159
- Don't lie. / - He's enjoying it. 

1702
01:08:14,159 --> 01:08:15,259
No. 

1703
01:08:16,259 --> 01:08:18,026
He hates everything that he seems to love. 

1704
01:08:18,626 --> 01:08:19,826
He's enjoying it too much. 

1705
01:08:19,826 --> 01:08:22,859
(You need to ride with the rhythm, excited) 

1706
01:08:24,759 --> 01:08:26,026
Gosh. 

1707
01:08:27,392 --> 01:08:29,926
- The wind felt so good. / - Yes. 

1708
01:08:29,926 --> 01:08:31,026
(Wan Jun Tour slowly starts to race) 

1709
01:08:31,026 --> 01:08:33,892
- Horses are very sensitive animals. / - Yes. 

1710
01:08:33,892 --> 01:08:36,659
They said you need a professional by your side. 

1711
01:08:36,659 --> 01:08:39,392
For people who have horse riding licenses... 

1712
01:08:39,392 --> 01:08:40,759
- They can ride alone. / - Of course. 

1713
01:08:40,759 --> 01:08:42,226
- They can race. / - Yes. 

1714
01:08:42,226 --> 01:08:43,526
I didn't know that there was a license. 

1715
01:08:45,959 --> 01:08:50,192
(Jeju-do's blue sea is connected to the meadow) 

1716
01:08:51,292 --> 01:08:54,992
(A beautiful sight that will remain in your memory) 

1717
01:08:57,259 --> 01:08:59,892
(His face is full of smiles) 

1718
01:09:01,092 --> 01:09:02,759
(He is enjoying it and feels happy) 

1719
01:09:02,759 --> 01:09:04,026
This is amazing. 

1720
01:09:06,459 --> 01:09:09,492
(The sky has cleared up, adding to the beauty) 

1721
01:09:11,992 --> 01:09:19,059
(They fall in love with the charm of horse riding) 

1722
01:09:20,559 --> 01:09:22,092
This really was my dream. 

1723
01:09:22,926 --> 01:09:24,126
This is amazing. 

1724
01:09:24,126 --> 01:09:26,392
I want to race there at full speed. 

1725
01:09:26,392 --> 01:09:27,392
Me too. 

1726
01:09:27,392 --> 01:09:29,126
(Seogwipo seafood set) 

1727
01:09:29,826 --> 01:09:32,092
- This is the lobster. / - It's game over here. 

1728
01:09:32,092 --> 01:09:33,726
- So this is the place. / - Lobster. 

1729
01:09:33,726 --> 01:09:35,126
You can eat while looking at 

1730
01:09:35,126 --> 01:09:37,692
Seongsan Ilchulbong at this restaurant. 

1731
01:09:37,692 --> 01:09:39,826
- I love Seongsan Ilchulbong. / - We rode horses. 

1732
01:09:40,226 --> 01:09:42,859
We raced the meadow amazingly on horses. 

1733
01:09:43,526 --> 01:09:44,826
For today's final course, 

1734
01:09:44,826 --> 01:09:46,759
it's the hottest place right now 

1735
01:09:46,759 --> 01:09:47,959
among seafood restaurants. 

1736
01:09:47,959 --> 01:09:48,526
It's the best place. 

1737
01:09:48,526 --> 01:09:50,126
Also... 

1738
01:09:50,126 --> 01:09:51,526
- Look at that. / - It's Seongsan Ilchulbong. 

1739
01:09:51,526 --> 01:09:52,892
The weather was bad yesterday. 

1740
01:09:52,892 --> 01:09:54,492
You can see from afar. 

1741
01:09:54,492 --> 01:09:55,659
(There's a view of Seongsan Ilchulbong) 

1742
01:09:55,659 --> 01:09:56,792
I'm going to save it in my mind. 

1743
01:09:56,792 --> 01:09:58,726
You can also taste crabs there. 

1744
01:09:59,926 --> 01:10:00,526
This is the hottest place. 

1745
01:10:00,526 --> 01:10:03,659
- Let's go. / - It's been a while since I ate crabs. 

1746
01:10:04,592 --> 01:10:07,059
The decoration of the restaurant feels like lobsters. 

1747
01:10:07,059 --> 01:10:08,059
(The decoration of the restaurant is charming) 

1748
01:10:08,059 --> 01:10:10,092
I heard this place was really hot these days. 

1749
01:10:12,092 --> 01:10:13,226
(Located in Gujwa, Gimnyeong) 

1750
01:10:13,226 --> 01:10:15,492
- It's a really new good restaurant. / - Yes. 

1751
01:10:15,492 --> 01:10:16,759
It was really delicious. 

1752
01:10:16,759 --> 01:10:18,859
I only went to octopus instant noodle places 

1753
01:10:18,859 --> 01:10:20,426
near Seongsan Ilchulbong. 

1754
01:10:20,426 --> 01:10:21,959
Octopus instant noodles sound great. 

1755
01:10:21,959 --> 01:10:24,826
It's been open for less than a month. 

1756
01:10:24,826 --> 01:10:25,826
- Are you talking about that place? / - Yes. 

1757
01:10:25,826 --> 01:10:27,359
It's very popular. 

1758
01:10:27,359 --> 01:10:30,926
Families and couples come to this place a lot. 

1759
01:10:32,459 --> 01:10:34,159
It's splendid. 

1760
01:10:36,492 --> 01:10:38,859
- Everything in there was good. / - Looks expensive. 

1761
01:10:38,859 --> 01:10:40,459
- Looks expensive. / - They're all fresh. 

1762
01:10:40,459 --> 01:10:42,026
There's shrimp and corn. 

1763
01:10:45,259 --> 01:10:48,126
You have to add lobsters separately. 

1764
01:10:48,226 --> 01:10:50,626
The price differs according to size. 

1765
01:10:50,626 --> 01:10:53,526
($21 per person excluding lobster) 

1766
01:10:53,892 --> 01:10:56,059
Here's your food. 

1767
01:10:56,059 --> 01:10:58,992
(The food looks extraordinary) 

1768
01:10:58,992 --> 01:11:00,626
- It's amazing. / - They serve it in a bucket. 

1769
01:11:00,626 --> 01:11:02,192
Is that for that price? 

1770
01:11:02,192 --> 01:11:03,759
Wow. 

1771
01:11:05,292 --> 01:11:07,292
(They're in wonder) 

1772
01:11:09,359 --> 01:11:10,459
This is amazing. 

1773
01:11:11,926 --> 01:11:13,259
- This is amazing. / - Oh, my. 

1774
01:11:14,159 --> 01:11:16,459
They just pour it on the table. 

1775
01:11:16,859 --> 01:11:18,226
- On the table? / - Yeah. 

1776
01:11:18,226 --> 01:11:19,659
I've never seen anything like it. 

1777
01:11:19,659 --> 01:11:21,759
You wouldn't need a plate then. 

1778
01:11:21,759 --> 01:11:23,692
(Basil oil and chili powder adds flavor) 

1779
01:11:23,692 --> 01:11:24,759
It even has lobsters. 

1780
01:11:24,759 --> 01:11:27,292
American guys stack the beers as they eat that. 

1781
01:11:27,892 --> 01:11:30,192
You can take photos because it's decorated prettily. 

1782
01:11:30,192 --> 01:11:32,159
- There's shrimp. / - It is really creative. 

1783
01:11:32,159 --> 01:11:35,326
- Isn't this only in Jeju-do? / - They pour it on the table. 

1784
01:11:37,559 --> 01:11:38,759
The shrimp has claws. 

1785
01:11:38,759 --> 01:11:42,959
They look like shrimp but they are lobsters in English. 

1786
01:11:42,959 --> 01:11:44,726
Red-banded lobster? 

1787
01:11:44,726 --> 01:11:45,659
(Red-banded lobsters have big claws and red bands) 

1788
01:11:45,659 --> 01:11:46,259
This is amazing. 

1789
01:11:46,259 --> 01:11:48,326
- This is how you eat it. / - Red-banded lobster. 

1790
01:11:48,326 --> 01:11:50,359
It really looks unique. 

1791
01:11:50,926 --> 01:11:54,026
- Be careful of the head and tail. / - It has horns. 

1792
01:11:54,026 --> 01:11:56,492
- It's really sharp. / - Oh, I see. 

1793
01:11:56,492 --> 01:11:58,526
You can't eat the claws. 

1794
01:11:58,526 --> 01:12:00,626
So you have to remove them. 

1795
01:12:00,859 --> 01:12:03,492
- Be careful when you eat with kids. / - Be careful. 

1796
01:12:03,726 --> 01:12:05,592
- They explain it for you. / - Yes. 

1797
01:12:05,892 --> 01:12:08,059
- Separate the body from the head. / - Yes. 

1798
01:12:08,859 --> 01:12:10,559
If you pound on the body too strong, 

1799
01:12:10,559 --> 01:12:11,959
the flesh will get crushed too. 

1800
01:12:11,959 --> 01:12:14,226
Pound on it gently. 

1801
01:12:14,292 --> 01:12:15,859
Pull it apart. 

1802
01:12:17,159 --> 01:12:18,592
This is how you eat it. 

1803
01:12:19,092 --> 01:12:20,692
You can remove it easily. 

1804
01:12:20,892 --> 01:12:23,359
I thought red-banded lobsters were too troublesome 

1805
01:12:23,359 --> 01:12:25,192
but it was fun to eat after we knew how to eat it. 

1806
01:12:25,192 --> 01:12:26,192
You can't stop eating it. 

1807
01:12:26,192 --> 01:12:27,892
- They really look like lobsters. / - Yes. 

1808
01:12:27,892 --> 01:12:29,126
With that... 

1809
01:12:29,692 --> 01:12:33,292
- You eat it plain. / - It's good. 

1810
01:12:33,592 --> 01:12:35,559
Or you can eat them with the sauce you prefer. 

1811
01:12:36,059 --> 01:12:37,192
It's good. 

1812
01:12:39,559 --> 01:12:41,292
It makes a snap sound when you open it. 

1813
01:12:41,292 --> 01:12:43,592
(He does his best to peel it) 

1814
01:12:49,926 --> 01:12:52,759
Ordinary shrimp is good, 

1815
01:12:52,759 --> 01:12:55,226
but you could get a little tired 

1816
01:12:55,226 --> 01:12:57,359
if you eat a lot. 

1817
01:12:57,359 --> 01:12:58,426
But you don't get tired of this at all. 

1818
01:12:58,426 --> 01:13:00,959
The red-banded lobsters are amazing. 

1819
01:13:01,359 --> 01:13:03,992
You have to be a little careful, but isn't it good? 

1820
01:13:03,992 --> 01:13:05,492
(They're in love) 

1821
01:13:07,326 --> 01:13:08,726
(They can't stop eating the red-banded lobsters) 

1822
01:13:08,726 --> 01:13:09,859
Red-banded lobsters are really good. 

1823
01:13:09,859 --> 01:13:11,392
- It's fun to peel them. / - But... 

1824
01:13:11,392 --> 01:13:13,092
- There are lobsters there, right? / - Yes. 

1825
01:13:13,092 --> 01:13:14,926
Do you have to peel the lobsters too? 

1826
01:13:14,926 --> 01:13:17,892
No, while we ate other seafood, 

1827
01:13:17,892 --> 01:13:19,959
an employee peeled it for us. 

1828
01:13:19,959 --> 01:13:23,159
- Did they peel it for you then? / - Yes. 

1829
01:13:23,159 --> 01:13:24,292
They're getting them ready while we're eating. 

1830
01:13:25,059 --> 01:13:25,892
You have to eat seafood... 

1831
01:13:25,892 --> 01:13:27,492
- It was really delicious. / - With beer or white wine. 

1832
01:13:27,492 --> 01:13:29,926
- White wine would go well. / - Yes, white wine. 

1833
01:13:29,926 --> 01:13:31,359
It's here. 

1834
01:13:32,626 --> 01:13:34,459
- I want to try that. / - It's the lobster. 

1835
01:13:34,459 --> 01:13:36,059
(No words are needed) 

1836
01:13:36,059 --> 01:13:38,492
- Look at the flesh. / - Look at the claws. 

1837
01:13:38,492 --> 01:13:40,392
- Claws. / - They decorated it prettily. 

1838
01:13:43,259 --> 01:13:44,226
If it's not fresh, 

1839
01:13:44,226 --> 01:13:46,092
it's fishy when you eat lobster innards. 

1840
01:13:46,092 --> 01:13:49,059
But the innards tasted really good there. 

1841
01:13:52,292 --> 01:13:53,559
Look how well they're trimmed. 

1842
01:13:53,559 --> 01:13:54,826
(Dongwan is surprised) 

1843
01:13:54,826 --> 01:13:56,892
- That's amazing. / - Eat it with the innards. 

1844
01:13:56,892 --> 01:13:59,892
(He eats it with the innards) 

1845
01:14:02,092 --> 01:14:03,459
- Is it good? / - It's good. 

1846
01:14:03,992 --> 01:14:05,359
If the lobster isn't fresh, 

1847
01:14:05,359 --> 01:14:07,692
the innards taste fishy. 

1848
01:14:08,159 --> 01:14:09,926
The innards are delicious. It's like sea urchin roe. 

1849
01:14:11,226 --> 01:14:12,226
(He's genuinely surprised) 

1850
01:14:12,226 --> 01:14:13,226
You're right. 

1851
01:14:14,892 --> 01:14:16,992
Look at this. 

1852
01:14:19,992 --> 01:14:22,092
I really want to eat that. 

1853
01:14:22,092 --> 01:14:23,792
Even the scent was different. 

1854
01:14:24,959 --> 01:14:27,092
The lobsters in Seoul weren't that good. 

1855
01:14:27,092 --> 01:14:28,226
I know the reason why now. 

1856
01:14:28,692 --> 01:14:29,792
They weren't fresh. 

1857
01:14:29,792 --> 01:14:32,692
- Isn't this really fresh? / - It even smells different. 

1858
01:14:34,226 --> 01:14:35,259
Is this possible? 

1859
01:14:35,426 --> 01:14:37,259
I think they're all fresh. 

1860
01:14:40,626 --> 01:14:43,826
(Sadly, you can't stop time and time flies) 

1861
01:14:43,826 --> 01:14:45,359
We have been continuing to work as SHINHWA 

1862
01:14:45,359 --> 01:14:46,226
and our individual things. 

1863
01:14:46,226 --> 01:14:47,626
We couldn't make time for ourselves 

1864
01:14:47,626 --> 01:14:49,359
and time has gone by really fast. 

1865
01:14:50,826 --> 01:14:56,359
We've never been on a trip like this for over 20 years. 

1866
01:14:56,359 --> 01:14:58,526
(The first trip they went on together) 

1867
01:14:59,626 --> 01:15:00,626
(A friendship trip that even bad weather can't stop) 

1868
01:15:00,626 --> 01:15:04,126
It was raining yesterday but because it was us two, 

1869
01:15:04,126 --> 01:15:05,626
we managed to figure out what to do. 

1870
01:15:05,626 --> 01:15:07,026
Even when went go-karting and 

1871
01:15:07,026 --> 01:15:08,526
dirty water was splashed on us, 

1872
01:15:08,526 --> 01:15:09,826
it felt good. 

1873
01:15:09,826 --> 01:15:13,392
(The inconvenience turned into a fun time) 

1874
01:15:13,392 --> 01:15:16,026
We went horse riding where we could see the sea. 

1875
01:15:16,026 --> 01:15:20,026
Could we really have experienced all this 

1876
01:15:20,026 --> 01:15:21,392
without this show? 

1877
01:15:23,992 --> 01:15:26,492
How was traveling with me for the first time? 

1878
01:15:26,492 --> 01:15:28,392
- It was good. / - Was it good? 

1879
01:15:28,392 --> 01:15:30,892
I know that you're serious 

1880
01:15:30,892 --> 01:15:32,859
but can't you express some more when we're on TV? 

1881
01:15:33,259 --> 01:15:36,059
It was really good to come here with you. 

1882
01:15:37,892 --> 01:15:40,326
I think you will go on trips together a lot from now on. 

1883
01:15:40,326 --> 01:15:42,292
I think another one in 20 years will be perfect. 

1884
01:15:43,326 --> 01:15:44,526
Let's eat. 

1885
01:15:45,226 --> 01:15:46,959
What was more fun, yesterday or today? 

1886
01:15:46,959 --> 01:15:47,959
I had more fun today. 

1887
01:15:49,626 --> 01:15:51,559
No, you had more fun yesterday. 

1888
01:15:51,559 --> 01:15:52,392
Yesterday was fun 

1889
01:15:52,392 --> 01:15:54,726
but there were both good and bad things. 

1890
01:15:54,726 --> 01:15:58,526
We went through a lot of trouble for 2 days. 

1891
01:15:58,526 --> 01:16:00,659
Let's cheer for the Wan Jun Tour and end it. 

1892
01:16:01,426 --> 01:16:03,092
Should we do the dance we did earlier? 

1893
01:16:04,059 --> 01:16:05,259
The dance we did earlier? 

1894
01:16:05,259 --> 01:16:07,259
1, 2, 3, 4. 

1895
01:16:08,259 --> 01:16:11,092
(Dongwan) 

1896
01:16:11,092 --> 01:16:14,926
(And Jun Jin) 

1897
01:16:15,126 --> 01:16:17,359
Let's go, Wan Jun Tour. 

1898
01:16:21,859 --> 01:16:24,392
- It was so fun. / - It was nice because... 

1899
01:16:24,392 --> 01:16:26,892
- We've never been to those places. / - Right. 

1900
01:16:26,892 --> 01:16:27,992
- It was so nice. / - We went to new places. 

1901
01:16:27,992 --> 01:16:30,492
We did a lot of horse riding on Battle Trip. 

1902
01:16:30,492 --> 01:16:34,359
But it was the first time riding on a meadow... 

1903
01:16:34,359 --> 01:16:35,359
- Connected to the sea. / - Is it the first time? 

1904
01:16:35,359 --> 01:16:36,792
It was the best. 

1905
01:16:36,792 --> 01:16:39,526
This farm is famous for... 

1906
01:16:39,526 --> 01:16:41,726
- Mandarin peels in the winter. / - Yes, it's famous... 

1907
01:16:41,726 --> 01:16:43,592
For dry mandarin peels. 

1908
01:16:43,592 --> 01:16:46,792
The wide meadow will turn into an orange sea. 

1909
01:16:46,792 --> 01:16:49,492
- It's a nice place to take photos. / - It's a hot place. 

1910
01:16:49,492 --> 01:16:51,092
- A lot of people go there. / - Really? 

1911
01:16:51,092 --> 01:16:53,092
You ate a lot of delicious things. 

1912
01:16:53,092 --> 01:16:54,959
If you had to choose only one to eat right now, 

1913
01:16:54,959 --> 01:16:56,259
what would you choose? 

1914
01:16:56,259 --> 01:16:58,259
- Black pork. / - Black pork? Really? 

1915
01:16:58,259 --> 01:17:00,459
- I want to have them all. / - The meat is really different. 

1916
01:17:00,459 --> 01:17:01,792
No matter how well you cook other meat... 

1917
01:17:01,792 --> 01:17:03,159
- It wouldn't taste like that. / - It's crispy like apples. 

1918
01:17:03,626 --> 01:17:04,626
- Is it like apples? / - Really? 

1919
01:17:04,626 --> 01:17:07,992
I really recommend Jeju-do for a gourmet tour. 

1920
01:17:07,992 --> 01:17:10,026
What did you want to eat the most 

1921
01:17:10,026 --> 01:17:10,892
while watching their trip? 

1922
01:17:10,892 --> 01:17:13,926
I wanted to try the RC car. 

1923
01:17:15,026 --> 01:17:16,026
It was really fun. 

1924
01:17:16,526 --> 01:17:18,826
- He keeps smiling. / - Do you like RC cars? 

1925
01:17:18,826 --> 01:17:22,259
I like all kinds of toys. 

1926
01:17:22,259 --> 01:17:23,392
I like to do things like that. 

1927
01:17:23,392 --> 01:17:25,259
What about food? What did you want to eat the most? 

1928
01:17:25,259 --> 01:17:26,492
Food? 

1929
01:17:27,359 --> 01:17:29,459
For food... 

1930
01:17:29,992 --> 01:17:31,259
- He has no interest. / - No, it's because... 

1931
01:17:31,259 --> 01:17:33,392
The restaurant we went to was more delicious. 

1932
01:17:33,392 --> 01:17:34,392
(Good job) 

1933
01:17:34,392 --> 01:17:35,292
Good job. 

1934
01:17:37,492 --> 01:17:39,426
I could only think about the places we went. 

1935
01:17:39,426 --> 01:17:40,692
You're going to be in trouble 

1936
01:17:40,692 --> 01:17:43,026
if there isn't a good restaurant. 

1937
01:17:43,026 --> 01:17:44,292
- Let's see. / - Okay. 

1938
01:17:44,292 --> 01:17:45,526
- Yes. / - Okay. 

1939
01:17:45,526 --> 01:17:47,526
- Let's see the expense. / - Let's see the expense. 

1940
01:17:47,526 --> 01:17:50,959
Let's see the expense of Wan Jun Tour to Seogwipo. 

1941
01:17:50,959 --> 01:17:54,226
Jun Jin, what's the final expense 

1942
01:17:54,226 --> 01:17:55,759
excluding airfare? 

1943
01:17:55,759 --> 01:17:59,292
The final expense we spent in Seogwipo is... 

1944
01:17:59,292 --> 01:18:01,259
What's the final expense? 

1945
01:18:01,259 --> 01:18:02,926
- Per person. / - Per person! 

1946
01:18:02,926 --> 01:18:04,092
The total... 

1947
01:18:05,526 --> 01:18:08,326
$323. 

1948
01:18:09,426 --> 01:18:10,759
- $320? / - If we didn't rent... 

1949
01:18:10,759 --> 01:18:13,259
A convertible on the second day, 

1950
01:18:13,259 --> 01:18:15,726
- We would have saved $50. / - You could save... 

1951
01:18:15,726 --> 01:18:17,359
- $50 more. / - That's right. 

1952
01:18:17,359 --> 01:18:19,026
As Jun Jin said... 

1953
01:18:19,026 --> 01:18:20,259
- It was his wish... / - It was my wish. 

1954
01:18:20,259 --> 01:18:22,526
To drive along the coastal road. 

1955
01:18:22,526 --> 01:18:24,626
- If you're there... / - How nice is that? Of course. 

1956
01:18:24,626 --> 01:18:26,126
It would be nice to drive when you're there. 

1957
01:18:26,126 --> 01:18:28,626
I also went on a lot of trips to Southeast Asia 

1958
01:18:28,626 --> 01:18:30,292
such as Bali and Indonesia. 

1959
01:18:30,292 --> 01:18:31,526
You might think that it's more expensive 

1960
01:18:31,526 --> 01:18:32,892
than these places, 

1961
01:18:32,892 --> 01:18:35,192
but I really want to recommend it 

1962
01:18:35,192 --> 01:18:36,259
because the quality of the food is different. 

1963
01:18:36,259 --> 01:18:37,359
Jeju-do is perfect... 

1964
01:18:37,359 --> 01:18:39,692
- For a gourmet tour. / - Okay. 

1965
01:18:39,692 --> 01:18:42,426
Let's go. Would you go to Seogwipo, Jeju-do 

1966
01:18:42,426 --> 01:18:46,726
according to Wan Jun Tour's plan? 

1967
01:18:46,726 --> 01:18:48,426
Please vote.

(What will the judges choose?) 

1970
01:18:58,859 --> 01:19:00,526
We saw Wan Jun Tour 

1971
01:19:00,526 --> 01:19:01,692
where they conquered Seogwipo. 

1972
01:19:01,692 --> 01:19:04,092
Next week, we will go to Jeju City. 

1973
01:19:04,092 --> 01:19:06,292
Planned by Baekho, the Aewol Prince. 

1974
01:19:06,559 --> 01:19:07,592
Prince. 

1975
01:19:07,592 --> 01:19:09,559
- I'm looking forward to it. / - The Jeju City tour. 

1976
01:19:09,559 --> 01:19:11,326
Please look forward to it next week. 

1977
01:19:11,326 --> 01:19:12,892
Thank you. 

1978
01:19:16,326 --> 01:19:17,326
(Next episode) 

1979
01:19:18,092 --> 01:19:19,326
Baekho Tour. 

1980
01:19:19,326 --> 01:19:21,826
The place I was born and raised and know really well. 

1981
01:19:21,826 --> 01:19:23,992
- It feels completely different now. / - Isn't that right? 

1982

(The longest distance in Asia, a big ball activity) 

1983
01:19:32,426 --> 01:19:34,726
We ate so much yesterday. 

1984
01:19:34,726 --> 01:19:36,826
- Gosh, it's good. It passes. / - Does it pass? 

1985
01:19:38,592 --> 01:19:40,392
We really have to eat this. 

1986
01:19:40,392 --> 01:19:41,626
What should I do? 

1987
01:19:42,226 --> 01:19:44,659
It's the first time I've planned a trip. 

1988
01:19:45,026 --> 01:19:47,492
I was so happy.
