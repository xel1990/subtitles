00:00:08,111 --> 00:00:09,277
(Lee Jonghyuk, Lim Hyungjun) 

3
00:00:10,077 --> 00:00:11,411
(Lee Gikwang of Highlight) 

4
00:00:12,544 --> 00:00:14,144
Travel is war! 

5
00:00:14,144 --> 00:00:16,944
Battle Trip! 

6
00:00:19,844 --> 00:00:20,811
Just like last week, 

7
00:00:20,811 --> 00:00:23,111
he is back to provide us with vast knowledge. 

8
00:00:23,111 --> 00:00:25,244
- Kim Taehun, welcome back. / - Nice to meet you. 

9
00:00:26,044 --> 00:00:27,944
We're with the trip designers 

10
00:00:27,944 --> 00:00:30,744
who designed a unique trip 

11
00:00:30,744 --> 00:00:31,911
to cities of England. 

12
00:00:31,911 --> 00:00:33,911
- Right, welcome. / - Good to see you again. 

13
00:00:33,911 --> 00:00:35,477
- Where's Dujun? / - Wait a minute. 

14
00:00:36,411 --> 00:00:36,911
Where did he go? 

15
00:00:36,911 --> 00:00:37,944
Right now, Dujun... 

16
00:00:37,944 --> 00:00:41,344
He's playing a role of a superstar in a drama now. 

17
00:00:41,344 --> 00:00:43,544
- I see. / - He left due to his schedule. 

18
00:00:43,544 --> 00:00:45,211
You can pull this off by yourself, can't you? 

19
00:00:45,211 --> 00:00:46,611
You can pull this off by yourself, can't you? 

20
00:00:46,611 --> 00:00:47,644
Yes, I'm more than capable. 

21
00:00:48,744 --> 00:00:51,477
Unfortunately, Dujun couldn't join us this week 

22
00:00:51,477 --> 00:00:52,611
due to his schedule. 

23
00:00:52,611 --> 00:00:55,011
But you guys have Taehun. 

24
00:00:55,011 --> 00:00:56,711
- That's right. / - But isn't England hard for you? 

25
00:00:57,577 --> 00:00:59,244
Well, personally, 

26
00:00:59,244 --> 00:01:00,944
I have a long history with England. 

27
00:01:00,944 --> 00:01:02,277
What kind of history do you have? 

28
00:01:02,277 --> 00:01:04,177
I worked at an English company 

29
00:01:04,177 --> 00:01:05,811
before I became a freelancer. 

30
00:01:06,911 --> 00:01:07,877
- Goodness! / - England! 

31
00:01:07,877 --> 00:01:09,277
It was a music company... 

32
00:01:09,277 --> 00:01:11,577
- An English company. / - He's actually a pop columnist. 

33
00:01:12,677 --> 00:01:13,711
Thought he was a comedian, right? 

34
00:01:15,344 --> 00:01:18,111
I worked for the company for about 4 years. 

35
00:01:18,111 --> 00:01:20,844
I went on business trips to London and Liverpool often. 

36
00:01:20,844 --> 00:01:23,344
I also studied about the culture. 

37
00:01:23,344 --> 00:01:25,577
I think that's why I was invited today. 

38
00:01:25,577 --> 00:01:27,644
We have our 100 impartial judges 

39
00:01:27,644 --> 00:01:29,511
who will vote on today's trips. 

40
00:01:29,511 --> 00:01:31,211
Welcome. 

41
00:01:32,811 --> 00:01:37,977
The trip is divided into two halves. 

42
00:01:37,977 --> 00:01:41,244
- You will vote four times in total. / - That's right. 

43
00:01:41,244 --> 00:01:43,011
The votes won't be accumulated. 

44
00:01:43,011 --> 00:01:46,044
Only the final votes will decide the winners. 

45
00:01:46,044 --> 00:01:47,377
Well... 

46
00:01:47,377 --> 00:01:49,677
Last week's episode was the best of the best. 

47
00:01:49,677 --> 00:01:50,977
It was a dream match for soccer fans. 

48
00:01:50,977 --> 00:01:54,177
They got to watch the Manchester Derby. 

49
00:01:54,177 --> 00:01:55,777
Last week's episode was similar 

50
00:01:55,777 --> 00:01:56,977
to the fermented skate set. 

51
00:01:56,977 --> 00:01:58,111
- Why's that? / - Skate set. 

52
00:01:58,111 --> 00:02:00,077
People who like it really love it. 

53
00:02:00,077 --> 00:02:01,877
But those who don't eat it, don't even look at it. 

54
00:02:02,577 --> 00:02:03,377
It was kind of like that. 

55
00:02:03,377 --> 00:02:04,444
I like that analogy. 

56
00:02:04,444 --> 00:02:07,577
We've been hosting Battle Trip for around 2 years. 

57
00:02:07,577 --> 00:02:09,377
The audience... 

58
00:02:09,377 --> 00:02:10,244
- It felt like... / - They were really... 

59
00:02:10,244 --> 00:02:12,044
- Their faces... / - Didn't it seem like a temple stay? 

60
00:02:12,044 --> 00:02:13,577
They were very quiet 

61
00:02:13,577 --> 00:02:15,744
and with so much being about soccer, 

62
00:02:15,744 --> 00:02:18,244
there was a clear division of likes and dislikes. 

63
00:02:18,244 --> 00:02:19,144
I agree. 

64
00:02:19,144 --> 00:02:20,444
But the whole trip 

65
00:02:20,444 --> 00:02:22,177
wasn't just about soccer. 

66
00:02:22,177 --> 00:02:23,244
There was food. 

67
00:02:23,244 --> 00:02:24,911
- And activities. / - Lots to see. 

68
00:02:24,911 --> 00:02:27,711
- They did the indoor skydiving. / - That's right. 

69
00:02:27,711 --> 00:02:28,711
- There were activities. / - There was a sparrow too. 

70
00:02:28,711 --> 00:02:29,511
- Yes, yes. / - Sparrow... 

71
00:02:29,511 --> 00:02:31,511
- Sparrow? / - The sparrow was the best. 

72
00:02:31,511 --> 00:02:33,777
We must watch Liverpool's trip now. 

73
00:02:34,844 --> 00:02:37,544
Actually, we don't know much about Liverpool. 

74
00:02:37,544 --> 00:02:39,144
- That's true. People don't. / - We don't know. 

75
00:02:39,144 --> 00:02:40,544
Even in travel books, 

76
00:02:40,544 --> 00:02:43,511
there's no information on Liverpool. 

77
00:02:43,511 --> 00:02:45,844
So you must pay close attention. 

78
00:02:47,544 --> 00:02:49,211
- The information... / - It means people don't go. 

79
00:02:49,211 --> 00:02:51,177
- Pardon? / - It means no one goes there. 

80
00:02:51,177 --> 00:02:53,911
Well... They couldn't go because they didn't know. 

81
00:02:53,911 --> 00:02:55,677
Isn't this what we do on Battle Trip? 

82
00:02:55,677 --> 00:02:57,711
This Liverpool trip from Battle Trip... 

83
00:02:57,711 --> 00:03:00,044
- Will serve as a guide. / - That's right! 

84
00:03:00,044 --> 00:03:02,144
I shouldn't say this because 

85
00:03:02,144 --> 00:03:03,344
they are our opposing team. 

86
00:03:03,344 --> 00:03:05,544
You don't need travel books for it 

87
00:03:05,544 --> 00:03:07,011
because it's a small city. 

88
00:03:07,011 --> 00:03:08,011
Is that so? 

89
00:03:08,011 --> 00:03:09,744
The second reason is... 

90
00:03:09,744 --> 00:03:12,177
That signs explain everything. 

91
00:03:12,177 --> 00:03:14,344
"Ringo Starr's favorite barber." 

92
00:03:15,677 --> 00:03:18,577
"John Lennon's favorite restaurant." 

93
00:03:18,577 --> 00:03:20,711
- The signs tell you everything. / - You don't need a guide. 

94
00:03:20,711 --> 00:03:22,977
You only need to walk about 15 to 20 minutes to... 

95
00:03:22,977 --> 00:03:23,911
You can see the whole city then? 

96
00:03:23,911 --> 00:03:26,077
- They are all nearby. / - The population... 

97
00:03:26,077 --> 00:03:27,711
- You can just walk? / - Is less than 1 million. 

98
00:03:27,711 --> 00:03:28,511
Really? 

99
00:03:28,511 --> 00:03:30,444
As far as I know, its population is less than 1 million. 

100
00:03:30,444 --> 00:03:31,811
Then you probably didn't pay any for transportation. 

101
00:03:31,811 --> 00:03:33,944
- That's right. / - You can go everywhere on foot. 

102
00:03:33,944 --> 00:03:35,411
I have a question. 

103
00:03:35,411 --> 00:03:37,877
- Liverpool is known for The Beatles. / - Right. 

104
00:03:37,877 --> 00:03:39,877
When we think about The Beatles, 

105
00:03:39,877 --> 00:03:41,477
we think of that album cover on the crossing. 

106
00:03:41,477 --> 00:03:42,211
We went there. 

107
00:03:42,211 --> 00:03:43,377
- You did it, right? / - Yes. 

108
00:03:43,377 --> 00:03:44,644
People think it's in Liverpool... 

109
00:03:44,644 --> 00:03:46,911
- It's on Abbey Road in London. / - Abbey Road. 

110
00:03:46,911 --> 00:03:49,577
That's why we stayed a night in London 

111
00:03:49,577 --> 00:03:50,977
then we headed to Liverpool. 

112
00:03:50,977 --> 00:03:53,244
When I went to London... 

113
00:03:53,244 --> 00:03:55,577
I should've gone there with four friends but I couldn't. 

114
00:03:55,577 --> 00:03:57,444
I just took the photo when people crossed the road. 

115
00:03:57,444 --> 00:03:58,911
- Like that. / - You can see it behind us. 

116
00:03:58,911 --> 00:04:00,244
Yes, this one. 

117
00:04:00,244 --> 00:04:01,677
- Everyone knows it. / - This one. 

118
00:04:01,677 --> 00:04:03,244
- When you actually go there... / - It's very famous. 

119
00:04:03,244 --> 00:04:04,811
The white lines aren't there. 

120
00:04:04,811 --> 00:04:06,077
- Yes, they've faded. / - They're mostly gone. 

121
00:04:06,077 --> 00:04:08,611
To be precise, they are walking away from it. 

122
00:04:08,611 --> 00:04:10,877
Abbey Road Studio is located on the left. 

123
00:04:10,877 --> 00:04:11,911
And if you look, 

124
00:04:11,911 --> 00:04:14,344
Paul McCartney is walking barefoot. 

125
00:04:14,344 --> 00:04:16,477
When the album was released, 

126
00:04:16,477 --> 00:04:18,411
people wondered why he walked barefoot. 

127
00:04:18,411 --> 00:04:20,044
There were rumors that Paul McCartney... 

128
00:04:20,044 --> 00:04:21,977
- Had already passed away. / - My goodness. 

129
00:04:21,977 --> 00:04:24,677
- See that white car on the left? / - Yes. 

130
00:04:24,677 --> 00:04:27,577
Just because that car was in the album photo, 

131
00:04:27,577 --> 00:04:31,177
that used car was sold at millions of dollars. 

132
00:04:31,177 --> 00:04:32,377
Back then... 

133
00:04:32,377 --> 00:04:35,311
- We placed a lot of meaning in such things. / - Yes. 

134
00:04:35,311 --> 00:04:36,544
We must start the first half now. 

135
00:04:36,544 --> 00:04:38,577
- Tell us what to focus on. / - Right. We... 

136
00:04:38,577 --> 00:04:40,511
There are so many songs that you... 

137
00:04:40,511 --> 00:04:43,377
- Wouldn't have guessed it's a Beatles song. / - Right. 

138
00:04:43,377 --> 00:04:45,844
That's how much we can relate to The Beatles. 

139
00:04:45,844 --> 00:04:46,877
In everything... 

140
00:04:46,877 --> 00:04:49,511
- There are hidden connections. / - It's intimate. 

141
00:04:49,511 --> 00:04:52,577
I didn't know this either. 

142
00:04:53,477 --> 00:04:54,577
But we followed the path of arguably 

143
00:04:54,577 --> 00:04:55,977
the most famous band in history on 

144
00:04:55,977 --> 00:04:58,944
how they made music and recorded it. 

145
00:04:58,944 --> 00:05:01,211
- Is this for real? / - Yes. 

146
00:05:01,211 --> 00:05:03,344
I'm a bit worried though. 

147
00:05:04,011 --> 00:05:05,711
You didn't only go to 

148
00:05:05,711 --> 00:05:08,777
those famous Beatles places everyone knows, right? 

149
00:05:08,777 --> 00:05:10,844
- You mentioned a great point. / - I mean... 

150
00:05:10,844 --> 00:05:14,044
For people who don't have interest in The Beatles... 

151
00:05:14,044 --> 00:05:15,344
Just like the soccer last week... 

152
00:05:15,344 --> 00:05:16,544
Just like the soccer last week... 

153
00:05:16,544 --> 00:05:18,344
- It could be worse... / - Just quietly... 

154
00:05:18,344 --> 00:05:19,611
- That could happen. / - Thing is... 

155
00:05:19,611 --> 00:05:21,244
There are lots of young people in the audience. 

156
00:05:21,244 --> 00:05:23,577
When you mention The Beatles, they seem unsure. 

157
00:05:23,577 --> 00:05:25,511
It's not an understatement to say 

158
00:05:25,511 --> 00:05:28,577
they influenced every musician. 

159
00:05:28,577 --> 00:05:30,811
- But the generation has changed. / - Exactly. 

160
00:05:30,811 --> 00:05:32,977
This analogy might help understand this better. 

161
00:05:32,977 --> 00:05:35,477
The novel, "Norwegian Wood" by Murakami Haruki. 

162
00:05:35,477 --> 00:05:38,311
- It used The Beatles' song. / - That's their song. 

163
00:05:39,544 --> 00:05:41,844
Actually, the song was used for the commercial too. 

164
00:05:41,844 --> 00:05:43,611
Once you hear it, you'll recognize it right away. 

165
00:05:43,611 --> 00:05:45,311
We need something to compete against their trip. 

166
00:05:45,311 --> 00:05:47,244
- Is there something huge? / - Yes, tell us, please. 

167
00:05:47,244 --> 00:05:48,811
Something really impressive in Liverpool? 

168
00:05:48,811 --> 00:05:52,211
For us... A totally huge hamburger. 

169
00:05:52,211 --> 00:05:53,311
They sell 3.2kg burger. 

170
00:05:53,311 --> 00:05:54,444
- 3.2kg burger? / - Yes. 

171
00:05:54,444 --> 00:05:56,044
- That's it. We won. / - The burger... 

172
00:05:56,044 --> 00:05:57,844
- We won! 3.2kg! / - It's almost... 

173
00:05:57,844 --> 00:05:59,444
- It's as heavy as an infant. / - Wow! 

174
00:05:59,444 --> 00:06:01,111
- An infant. / - 3.2kg burger... 

175
00:06:01,111 --> 00:06:03,544
- Did you finish the burger? / - I'd be sick of eating it. 

176
00:06:03,544 --> 00:06:04,411
You can't eat all that. 

177
00:06:04,411 --> 00:06:05,511
You can't eat all that. 

178
00:06:05,511 --> 00:06:06,877
- What? / - What? 

179
00:06:06,877 --> 00:06:08,944
Why eat it if you can't finish it? 

180
00:06:08,944 --> 00:06:11,344
But seriously, the burger... 

181
00:06:11,344 --> 00:06:13,177
- You have to see it. / - You'll know when you do. 

182
00:06:13,177 --> 00:06:14,677
It was very delicious. 

183
00:06:14,677 --> 00:06:15,811
Then you should've finished it. 

184
00:06:15,811 --> 00:06:16,711
- Pardon? / - Huh? 

185
00:06:16,711 --> 00:06:17,777
What I mean is... 

186
00:06:18,444 --> 00:06:19,944
Tell them we took the leftovers. 

187
00:06:20,811 --> 00:06:23,211
- One serving is around 200g, 180g. / - This big. 

188
00:06:23,211 --> 00:06:24,877
- Big eaters can eat more of course. / - 180g. 

189
00:06:24,877 --> 00:06:25,977
But that burger is over 15 servings. 

190
00:06:25,977 --> 00:06:27,344
Everyone in the front row could... 

191
00:06:27,344 --> 00:06:28,744
- Get a bite. / - Of course. 

192
00:06:28,744 --> 00:06:29,911
- It's that big? / - Wait... 

193
00:06:29,911 --> 00:06:31,844
The vibes are really good right now. 

194
00:06:31,844 --> 00:06:34,344
- We'll head to Liverpool. / - Everyone is so intrigued. 

195
00:06:34,977 --> 00:06:36,944
Let's take this vibe 

196
00:06:36,944 --> 00:06:39,511
and head to the first half of Liverpool. 

197
00:06:40,877 --> 00:06:43,711
From the viewers' point of view, 

198
00:06:43,711 --> 00:06:45,011
JH... 

199
00:06:45,011 --> 00:06:46,577
- It's this. / - MK. 

200
00:06:46,577 --> 00:06:47,977
Since it's Minkyo. 

201
00:06:47,977 --> 00:06:49,211
So let's be JH. 

202
00:06:49,211 --> 00:06:50,577
- JH? / - Yeah. 

203
00:06:50,577 --> 00:06:52,011
Not Jonghyuk. 

204
00:06:52,011 --> 00:06:53,144
I'm not confident. 

205
00:06:53,144 --> 00:06:54,544
JH for Jonghyuk and Hyungjun. 

206
00:06:54,544 --> 00:06:56,444
Isn't that too simple? JH. 

207
00:06:56,444 --> 00:06:57,811
- JJ. / - Jonghyuk, Hyungjun. 

208
00:06:57,811 --> 00:06:58,511
JJ isn't bad either. 

209
00:06:58,511 --> 00:07:00,277
- JJ? / - Yeah. Jonghyuk, Hyungjun. 

210
00:07:00,277 --> 00:07:03,277
Doesn't that sound like a club? JJ? 

211
00:07:03,277 --> 00:07:04,544
That's a famous club. 

212
00:07:05,711 --> 00:07:06,977
- JJ's not bad. / - JJ's not bad. 

213
00:07:06,977 --> 00:07:07,511
JJ Tour. 

214
00:07:07,511 --> 00:07:09,111
Does Minkyo know about this trip? 

215
00:07:09,111 --> 00:07:09,944
Minkyo... 

216
00:07:11,311 --> 00:07:13,511
MK Tour is so famous. 

217
00:07:13,511 --> 00:07:14,577
He looked like a local. 

218
00:07:14,577 --> 00:07:15,911
We need to ride that. 

219
00:07:17,177 --> 00:07:18,444
Why are you so good? 

220
00:07:18,444 --> 00:07:19,944
- Just eat it my style. / - Okay. 

221
00:07:19,944 --> 00:07:22,577
Minkyo was just too good. 

222
00:07:22,577 --> 00:07:23,877
What if he feels betrayed? 

223
00:07:23,877 --> 00:07:25,677
- Call him just in case. / - Then... 

224
00:07:27,144 --> 00:07:29,144
What's this, "slaves of MK?" 

225
00:07:29,377 --> 00:07:31,977
(Let's call MK first) 

226
00:07:31,977 --> 00:07:33,844
I don't have the guts to call Minkyo. 

227
00:07:33,844 --> 00:07:35,011
Seriously. 

228
00:07:35,011 --> 00:07:36,944
I'm serious. I can't bring myself to do it. 

229
00:07:37,711 --> 00:07:39,677
Can't you keep this a secret? 

230
00:07:41,277 --> 00:07:44,844
- It'll be on TV. / - He'll find out. 

231
00:07:44,844 --> 00:07:46,611
We should plan a good trip. 

232
00:07:47,444 --> 00:07:49,477
I'm really worried. 

233
00:07:49,477 --> 00:07:52,377
Jonghyuk treats everything like it's a hassle. 

234
00:07:53,477 --> 00:07:54,677
Don't feel pressured. 

235
00:07:54,677 --> 00:07:57,511
If we have fun, it will be fun for the viewers. 

236
00:07:57,511 --> 00:07:59,311
My shoulders feel burdened. 

237
00:07:59,311 --> 00:08:01,344
Which part of England did you always want to go? 

238
00:08:02,311 --> 00:08:03,544
England? 

239
00:08:03,544 --> 00:08:05,444
I heard London is the best city. 

240
00:08:05,444 --> 00:08:06,544
London is... 

241
00:08:09,777 --> 00:08:11,044
That's London Eye. 

242
00:08:12,244 --> 00:08:15,744
(The center of English culture) 

243
00:08:16,311 --> 00:08:19,011
(London) 

244
00:08:20,011 --> 00:08:22,477
Musicals are famous there too. 

245
00:08:22,477 --> 00:08:24,877
- Right, musicals... / - It's the home of musicals. 

246
00:08:24,877 --> 00:08:27,777
- Yes, you have to watch. / - We majored in theater. 

247
00:08:27,777 --> 00:08:32,644
I've always wanted to watch something on Broadway. 

248
00:08:32,644 --> 00:08:35,044
But I could never afford it. 

249
00:08:35,044 --> 00:08:36,244
So... 

250
00:08:36,244 --> 00:08:37,811
I even starred in... 

251
00:08:37,811 --> 00:08:41,011
- He's in a musical. / - I've been in "42nd Street." 

252
00:08:41,011 --> 00:08:43,444
- Right. / - But I've never been to Broadway. 

253
00:08:43,911 --> 00:08:44,811
(It's sad but so funny) 

254
00:08:45,344 --> 00:08:47,411
Are there any musicians you like? 

255
00:08:47,411 --> 00:08:48,644
Musicians? Well... 

256
00:08:48,644 --> 00:08:49,644
Sting. 

257
00:08:51,011 --> 00:08:52,411
- Elton John. / - Elton John. 

258
00:08:52,411 --> 00:08:53,844
- Elton John. / - Oh, Elton John... 

259
00:08:53,844 --> 00:08:55,377
It's the birthplace of pop music. 

260
00:08:55,377 --> 00:08:57,377
- There are many famous musicians. / - The Beatles. 

261
00:08:57,377 --> 00:08:59,344
- Right. The Beatles. / - They're so young there. 

262
00:08:59,344 --> 00:09:04,177
The first pop song I heard was "Yesterday." 

263
00:09:04,177 --> 00:09:05,444
- "Yesterday." / - Right. 

264
00:09:05,444 --> 00:09:06,977
It was when I was in elementary school. 

265
00:09:06,977 --> 00:09:08,944
We'd write the lyrics in Korean and memorize them. 

266
00:09:09,744 --> 00:09:12,677
Two of the members are still alive. 

267
00:09:12,677 --> 00:09:15,977
There must be a lot of things to commemorate them. 

268
00:09:16,677 --> 00:09:18,111
That's not bad. Following The Beatles. 

269
00:09:18,111 --> 00:09:20,011
- Their footsteps... / - Should we? 

270
00:09:20,011 --> 00:09:21,377
I was a musician myself. 

271
00:09:21,377 --> 00:09:22,044
You know it. 

272
00:09:22,811 --> 00:09:23,611
Music... 

273
00:09:23,611 --> 00:09:24,677
- He used to be a singer. / - I was... 

274
00:09:24,677 --> 00:09:25,544
I was a singer. 

275
00:09:26,111 --> 00:09:27,777
My gosh, I was famous for my music. 

276
00:09:28,177 --> 00:09:30,244
You even wrote a song, didn't you? 

277
00:09:30,977 --> 00:09:32,744
- Of course. / - He even wrote a song? 

278
00:09:32,744 --> 00:09:33,644
Yes. You bet. 

279
00:09:33,644 --> 00:09:34,644
I get royalties for that. 

280
00:09:37,844 --> 00:09:38,744
My gosh, it's been a while. 

281
00:09:38,744 --> 00:09:41,577
- When was that? 1998? 20 years ago. / - In 1998. 

282
00:09:43,111 --> 00:09:44,211
How embarrassing. 

283
00:09:44,211 --> 00:09:45,344
Your voice is high toned. 

284
00:09:45,344 --> 00:09:46,344
I sang with Lee Taeseop. 

285
00:09:46,344 --> 00:09:47,177
- Guitarist... / - Who? 

286
00:09:47,177 --> 00:09:48,944
Lee Taeseop from K2. 

287
00:09:48,944 --> 00:09:51,044
I thought it was Seotaiji in the photo. 

288
00:09:54,044 --> 00:09:54,844
Lena Park. 

289
00:09:54,844 --> 00:09:56,211
You know we debuted at the same time, right? 

290
00:09:56,211 --> 00:09:57,477
We're colleagues. 

291
00:09:57,477 --> 00:09:59,344
We even recorded in the same studio. 

292
00:09:59,344 --> 00:10:01,477
She recorded before I did. 

293
00:10:01,477 --> 00:10:05,577
I recorded my song after she recorded hers. 

294
00:10:05,577 --> 00:10:06,844
The sound engineer hated it. 

295
00:10:10,444 --> 00:10:11,844
With my first album... 

296
00:10:11,844 --> 00:10:13,877
A monk recorded before me. 

297
00:10:14,444 --> 00:10:16,077
- That's a unique experience. / - Yes. 

298
00:10:16,644 --> 00:10:17,477
"Diamond Sutra..." 

299
00:10:19,011 --> 00:10:20,777
(Researching intensely) 

300
00:10:23,344 --> 00:10:24,544
Good restaurants... 

301
00:10:24,544 --> 00:10:26,677
Minkyo, I have no idea about England. 

302
00:10:29,711 --> 00:10:30,311
Hamburger. 

303
00:10:30,311 --> 00:10:31,711
JJ Tour. 

304
00:10:31,711 --> 00:10:32,777
Coming soon. 

305
00:10:33,377 --> 00:10:35,711
(Let us introduce the JJ Tour) 

306
00:10:35,711 --> 00:10:37,944
(England) 

307
00:10:38,777 --> 00:10:39,711
What is that? 

308
00:10:39,711 --> 00:10:40,877
I told you. It's no joke. 

309
00:10:40,877 --> 00:10:42,844
- We fell from the sky. / - Is that skeleton? 

310
00:10:42,844 --> 00:10:44,644
- We fell from the sky. / - What's with your face? 

311
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:46,044
That's satisfaction on his face. 

312
00:10:47,111 --> 00:10:48,177
What is this? 

313
00:10:48,177 --> 00:10:49,377
That's the face of satisfaction. 

314
00:10:51,044 --> 00:10:51,677
What is this? 

315
00:10:53,511 --> 00:10:55,277
(Why would you only visit London in England?) 

316
00:10:55,277 --> 00:10:56,377
London... 

317
00:10:56,377 --> 00:10:58,777
I heard it feels very different 

318
00:10:58,777 --> 00:11:00,644
from the surrounding cities. 

319
00:11:00,644 --> 00:11:02,377
(JJ Tour) 

320
00:11:02,377 --> 00:11:03,411
(Thought nice and hard) 

321
00:11:03,411 --> 00:11:05,044
I really love The Beatles. 

322
00:11:05,577 --> 00:11:07,444
(The Beatles) 

323
00:11:07,444 --> 00:11:08,544
(Liverpool?) 

324
00:11:08,544 --> 00:11:09,711
(The Beatles equals Liverpool?) 

325
00:11:10,211 --> 00:11:11,144
(All over the city) 

326
00:11:16,477 --> 00:11:17,944
- They gained some weight. / - They look alike. 

327
00:11:19,044 --> 00:11:19,811
They look alike. 

328
00:11:19,811 --> 00:11:21,044
- They gained a lot of weight. / - Those people.... 

329
00:11:21,044 --> 00:11:22,344
They didn't have much hair. 

330
00:11:22,344 --> 00:11:24,011
There were so many great photo spots. 

331
00:11:24,011 --> 00:11:25,144
That's true. 

332
00:11:25,811 --> 00:11:26,944
(Experiencing the lives) 

333
00:11:26,944 --> 00:11:27,611
(Of The Beatles) 

334
00:11:27,611 --> 00:11:29,744
(A new look at England) 

335
00:11:29,744 --> 00:11:30,711
(We head there now) 

336
00:11:30,711 --> 00:11:32,144
(JJ Tour) 

337
00:11:32,144 --> 00:11:32,577
(Now) 

338
00:11:33,111 --> 00:11:34,477
(We begin) 

339
00:11:36,644 --> 00:11:38,011
You went to a lot of places. 

340
00:11:39,044 --> 00:11:41,277
- Beer from the brew. / - It's a tight schedule. 

341
00:11:41,277 --> 00:11:43,344
- They did a lot. / - Geez. 

342
00:11:43,344 --> 00:11:44,577
That's our favorite itinerary. 

343
00:11:44,577 --> 00:11:45,944
This is how far we've gotten? 

344
00:11:45,944 --> 00:11:48,377
We need to go 11 more hours. 

345
00:11:49,077 --> 00:11:50,344
First... 

346
00:11:50,344 --> 00:11:51,344
Liverpool. 

347
00:11:51,911 --> 00:11:53,344
We're going to London. 

348
00:11:53,344 --> 00:11:55,577
You've prepared for London, right? 

349
00:11:55,577 --> 00:11:57,711
I did research a few things. 

350
00:11:58,511 --> 00:12:00,544
For activities, we can go on the rides. 

351
00:12:00,544 --> 00:12:04,044
- Rides... / - Rides we can't find in Korea. 

352
00:12:04,044 --> 00:12:06,077
We can talk once we're there. 

353
00:12:06,077 --> 00:12:07,777
I've already... 

354
00:12:07,777 --> 00:12:09,477
Prepared everything we're doing in Liverpool. 

355
00:12:10,511 --> 00:12:12,277
You are... 

356
00:12:12,277 --> 00:12:13,611
Really... 

357
00:12:13,611 --> 00:12:16,044
The Beatles... 

358
00:12:17,111 --> 00:12:17,977
You know... 

359
00:12:17,977 --> 00:12:19,244
Im Jinmo? 

360
00:12:20,477 --> 00:12:22,511
The music, critic Im Jinmo. 

361
00:12:22,511 --> 00:12:23,911
You'll know more about them than him. 

362
00:12:26,111 --> 00:12:27,944
You will... 

363
00:12:27,944 --> 00:12:30,011
They really feel like old men. 

364
00:12:30,011 --> 00:12:31,211
The trip looks a bit depressing. 

365
00:12:31,211 --> 00:12:32,777
Would you like something? 

366
00:12:32,777 --> 00:12:33,577
I'd like some snacks. 

367
00:12:35,111 --> 00:12:37,277
- Shrimp crackers. / - Shrimp crackers. 

368
00:12:37,277 --> 00:12:38,277
Can I have two? 

369
00:12:38,277 --> 00:12:39,644
Sure, go ahead. 

370
00:12:39,644 --> 00:12:40,844
I'd like some beer too, please. 

371
00:12:40,844 --> 00:12:43,444
Can I have one pizza? 

372
00:12:51,177 --> 00:12:51,977
(Incheon International Airport) 

373
00:12:53,811 --> 00:12:54,711
12 hours. 

374
00:12:54,711 --> 00:12:56,677
- 12 hours. / - Yes, 12.5 hours. 

375
00:12:56,677 --> 00:12:58,077
We have arrived! 

376
00:12:58,077 --> 00:12:59,044
Oh, it's warm in here. 

377
00:12:59,044 --> 00:13:01,111
Why is it so warm in London? 

378
00:13:01,111 --> 00:13:02,277
It's refreshing. 

379
00:13:02,277 --> 00:13:03,211
Where are the palm trees? 

380
00:13:03,711 --> 00:13:06,977
(Let's breathe in the English air) 

381
00:13:06,977 --> 00:13:08,344
It must have rained earlier. 

382
00:13:08,344 --> 00:13:09,277
It feels... 

383
00:13:09,277 --> 00:13:11,744
- It's slightly humid. / - The air isn't that bad here. 

384
00:13:11,744 --> 00:13:12,577
Nice. 

385
00:13:12,577 --> 00:13:14,811
Let's head to downtown London first. 

386
00:13:14,811 --> 00:13:16,277
- We'll head there... / - How do we get there? 

387
00:13:16,277 --> 00:13:17,411
- Jump? 1, 2, 3. / - No. 

388
00:13:17,411 --> 00:13:17,844
Jump. 

389
00:13:17,844 --> 00:13:19,877
- 1, 2, 3. Jump. / - No. 

390
00:13:19,877 --> 00:13:21,877
- We need to go by car. / - Really? 

391
00:13:21,877 --> 00:13:22,544
- Jump? / - Let's do it just once. 

392
00:13:22,544 --> 00:13:24,944
- On the count of three. / - It's around 1.5 hours. 

393
00:13:24,944 --> 00:13:25,777
Let's get going first. 

394
00:13:25,777 --> 00:13:26,677
Yes, let's. 

395
00:13:26,677 --> 00:13:28,877
It's far from the airport. 

396
00:13:28,877 --> 00:13:30,177
Yes, a bit. 

397
00:13:33,644 --> 00:13:34,911
What a great view. 

398
00:13:34,911 --> 00:13:37,611
- They're playing a Radiohead song. / - The clock... 

399
00:13:37,611 --> 00:13:38,811
Clock tower. 

400
00:13:41,277 --> 00:13:42,744
- That's the symbol of England. / - Exactly. 

401
00:13:42,744 --> 00:13:45,311
When London was chosen to hold the Olympics... 

402
00:13:45,944 --> 00:13:47,311
The double-decker bus appeared 

403
00:13:47,311 --> 00:13:48,911
with the announcement. 

404
00:13:50,077 --> 00:13:51,444
Isn't London beautiful at night? 

405
00:13:51,444 --> 00:13:52,877
It was very beautiful. 

406
00:13:52,877 --> 00:13:53,811
I bet it was blissful. 

407
00:13:53,811 --> 00:13:55,111
You don't take the bus often, do you? 

408
00:13:56,577 --> 00:13:59,044
- This is my first time on a double-decker. / - Same. 

409
00:13:59,844 --> 00:14:00,877
That looks cool. 

410
00:14:00,877 --> 00:14:02,077
Isn't that cool? 

411
00:14:04,477 --> 00:14:06,644
So this is the charm of England. 

412
00:14:07,311 --> 00:14:08,477
It's amazing. 

413
00:14:08,477 --> 00:14:10,544
Because it's the evening... 

414
00:14:10,544 --> 00:14:12,244
- The lights... / - They're so good. 

415
00:14:13,044 --> 00:14:15,177
We should've sat in the front seats. 

416
00:14:16,444 --> 00:14:17,511
Yeah. 

417
00:14:20,244 --> 00:14:21,311
Ask at which stop they are getting off. 

418
00:14:22,311 --> 00:14:23,177
Ask them? 

419
00:14:23,177 --> 00:14:24,544
So we can sit there later. 

420
00:14:24,544 --> 00:14:25,211
Where are you from? 

421
00:14:27,711 --> 00:14:29,011
I told him to ask where they're going. 

422
00:14:30,044 --> 00:14:30,911
Where are you from? 

423
00:14:31,777 --> 00:14:33,511
Not where they're from. 

424
00:14:36,277 --> 00:14:37,911
I like going to distant countries for trips. 

425
00:14:38,577 --> 00:14:39,944
That way, it feels different. 

426
00:14:43,977 --> 00:14:46,444
This is The Beatles' debut song. 

427
00:14:46,444 --> 00:14:47,711
It's called "Love Me Do." 

428
00:14:47,711 --> 00:14:51,077
- I love Taehun's explanations. / - Yes, this is great. 

429
00:14:51,077 --> 00:14:52,011
Come over here. 

430
00:14:55,011 --> 00:14:57,611
(They will look around London on their 2nd day) 

431
00:14:59,011 --> 00:15:01,544
What's up with this weather? 

432
00:15:01,544 --> 00:15:03,277
It must always rain in England. 

433
00:15:03,277 --> 00:15:05,611
But isn't it better when it's gloomy in England? 

434
00:15:05,611 --> 00:15:07,277
Yeah, it does kind of feel that way. 

435
00:15:07,977 --> 00:15:10,977
Even the houses look English. 

436
00:15:10,977 --> 00:15:13,311
It's my first time but the houses look right. 

437
00:15:14,311 --> 00:15:18,744
(They walk the street as they bask in the ambience) 

438
00:15:18,744 --> 00:15:20,977
(Where are they headed to?) 

439
00:15:21,977 --> 00:15:23,911
We're going to go get lunch now. 

440
00:15:23,911 --> 00:15:25,844
I found a burger place. 

441
00:15:25,844 --> 00:15:27,077
Is it because you couldn't find any other place? 

442
00:15:27,077 --> 00:15:29,277
- No, I researched this. / - A burger... 

443
00:15:29,277 --> 00:15:31,244
- All the way here? / - I looked it up. 

444
00:15:31,244 --> 00:15:33,777
It's a really unique burger. 

445
00:15:33,777 --> 00:15:35,511
It's still a burger though. 

446
00:15:35,511 --> 00:15:36,711
It's a humongous burger. 

447
00:15:36,711 --> 00:15:37,877
It's a gigantic burger. 

448
00:15:37,877 --> 00:15:39,744
If you finish it, you get something. 

449
00:15:39,744 --> 00:15:41,444
What is the burger Jonghyuk looked up? 

450
00:15:41,444 --> 00:15:44,377
It's like giant pork cutlets in Korea, right? 

451
00:15:45,844 --> 00:15:47,044
What's going on? 

452
00:15:48,811 --> 00:15:49,644
Unbelievable. 

453
00:15:50,944 --> 00:15:52,811
If you finish within 40 minutes, you succeed. 

454
00:15:52,811 --> 00:15:53,711
One person? 

455
00:15:53,711 --> 00:15:55,177
Yes, just one person. 

456
00:15:55,177 --> 00:15:56,011
This is unbelievable. 

457
00:15:56,011 --> 00:15:56,944
For the first time in Korea. 

458
00:15:56,944 --> 00:15:58,844
This will be no. 1 on the search engines. 

459
00:15:58,844 --> 00:16:00,377
The photos on the wall... 

460
00:16:00,377 --> 00:16:03,211
That's right. They're all fails and successes. 

461
00:16:03,211 --> 00:16:05,344
Man vs. Food. 

462
00:16:05,344 --> 00:16:07,277
It's a battle between man and food. 

463
00:16:08,577 --> 00:16:09,411
Anyone home? 

464
00:16:09,411 --> 00:16:10,511
Is there anyone? 

465
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:15,411
The exterior of the restaurant 

466
00:16:15,411 --> 00:16:16,944
is the same with any other burger restaurants. 

467
00:16:16,944 --> 00:16:18,844
- But the photos... / - So many photos, right? 

468
00:16:18,844 --> 00:16:21,877
Some are from the U.S. People came from all over. 

469
00:16:21,877 --> 00:16:23,844
They come from all over the world. 

470
00:16:23,844 --> 00:16:25,611
To take on the challenge. 

471
00:16:25,611 --> 00:16:26,511
What's this? 

472
00:16:26,511 --> 00:16:27,411
What is this? 

473
00:16:27,411 --> 00:16:28,477
Unbelievable, right? 

474
00:16:29,544 --> 00:16:30,411
What is this? 

475
00:16:32,911 --> 00:16:34,711
They're doing the challenge now? 

476
00:16:34,711 --> 00:16:36,077
If you look there... 

477
00:16:36,077 --> 00:16:37,511
It says Legends. 

478
00:16:37,511 --> 00:16:40,077
They're the fastest eaters. 

479
00:16:40,077 --> 00:16:41,244
Heroes are those who succeeded. 

480
00:16:42,177 --> 00:16:44,077
Zero's are the fails. 

481
00:16:44,077 --> 00:16:46,944
If you fail, I guess you must wear the toilet cover. 

482
00:16:48,177 --> 00:16:49,444
If you succeed, you get money. 

483
00:16:49,444 --> 00:16:51,344
It's about 250 pounds. 

484
00:16:51,344 --> 00:16:54,411
That's over $300. 

485
00:16:54,411 --> 00:16:57,111
You know a lot about this challenge. 

486
00:16:57,111 --> 00:17:01,011
I have a small mouth by nature. 

487
00:17:01,011 --> 00:17:02,744
You should try that challenge. 

488
00:17:02,744 --> 00:17:04,344
Okay, I'll give this a shot. 

489
00:17:04,344 --> 00:17:05,644
I was going to try too 

490
00:17:05,644 --> 00:17:06,844
but my mouth is too small. 

491
00:17:08,811 --> 00:17:10,877
Are we going to be doing any challenges today? 

492
00:17:10,877 --> 00:17:12,211
- Yeah. / - Yeah? 

493
00:17:12,211 --> 00:17:13,077
One person, yeah. 

494
00:17:13,077 --> 00:17:15,977
- We need a regular burger too. / - Small burger. 

495
00:17:15,977 --> 00:17:16,811
Small burger. 

496
00:17:16,811 --> 00:17:18,777
Small burger. Okay, no problem. 

497
00:17:19,844 --> 00:17:22,277
- Take a close look at my burger. / - Okay. 

498
00:17:22,711 --> 00:17:24,377
You can all make this at home. 

499
00:17:25,144 --> 00:17:26,544
Check out the bun. 

500
00:17:27,677 --> 00:17:29,711
- How could he finish that? / - It weighs 3kg. 

501
00:17:29,711 --> 00:17:30,844
That's the patty. 

502
00:17:30,844 --> 00:17:31,977
The patty weighs 3kg. 

503
00:17:31,977 --> 00:17:34,244
You have to finish eating a breast of a cow. 

504
00:17:34,811 --> 00:17:35,777
But the thing is 

505
00:17:35,777 --> 00:17:38,311
the patty literally melts in your mouth. 

506
00:17:38,311 --> 00:17:40,011
It's not tough at all. It was so interesting. 

507
00:17:44,411 --> 00:17:46,877
(Can Jonghyuk succeed in this challenge?) 

508
00:17:48,144 --> 00:17:50,711
First of all, don't drink cola. 

509
00:17:50,711 --> 00:17:52,277
If you do, you'll feel full. 

510
00:17:52,277 --> 00:17:53,344
But I must drink it... 

511
00:17:53,344 --> 00:17:56,011
- To make my stomach bigger... / - No, no, no. 

512
00:17:56,011 --> 00:17:58,377
To help you digest, 

513
00:17:58,377 --> 00:17:59,544
pretend you're on a saddle. 

514
00:18:00,577 --> 00:18:02,644
- On a saddle? / - Like this? 

515
00:18:02,644 --> 00:18:05,511
- Eat it like that. / - I've seen people hit themselves. 

516
00:18:05,511 --> 00:18:07,511
If you do finish this challenge, 

517
00:18:07,511 --> 00:18:08,977
you'll go viral. 

518
00:18:09,744 --> 00:18:11,344
- You must finish within 40 minutes? / - Yes. 

519
00:18:11,344 --> 00:18:14,111
- That sounds doable. / - You'll be the first Korean... 

520
00:18:14,111 --> 00:18:15,344
To complete the challenge. 

521
00:18:15,344 --> 00:18:16,377
The very first Korean. 

522
00:18:18,877 --> 00:18:20,177
Do you think I'll succeed? 

523
00:18:20,177 --> 00:18:22,611
But still. Don't drink cola. 

524
00:18:22,611 --> 00:18:24,344
Fine. I'll try to eat as much as I can. 

525
00:18:26,177 --> 00:18:26,711
What is that? 

526
00:18:33,611 --> 00:18:35,044
- That's seriously... / - That's so... 

527
00:18:35,044 --> 00:18:36,444
It looks really delicious. 

528
00:18:36,444 --> 00:18:39,011
That's one year's worth of burgers. 

529
00:18:40,877 --> 00:18:44,244
If successful, he wins a 250 pound cash prize. 

530
00:18:44,244 --> 00:18:45,744
(My gosh, Jonghyuk) 

531
00:18:46,211 --> 00:18:47,544
I felt a bit... 

532
00:18:47,544 --> 00:18:48,977
- You get sick of it. / - I felt a slight wake up call. 

533
00:18:50,244 --> 00:18:52,644
They put a lot of cheese too. 

534
00:18:54,744 --> 00:18:56,644
- That's mayonnaise. / - That's mayonnaise? 

535
00:18:57,444 --> 00:18:59,711
- They're making it not edible. / - Just use a ladle. 

536
00:19:03,077 --> 00:19:06,744
Anyway, when you're on a trip, that'd be fun. 

537
00:19:06,744 --> 00:19:08,277
Does it have 100,000 calories? 

538
00:19:08,277 --> 00:19:10,677
- You'll get sick if you eat that. / - Oh, my God. 

539
00:19:12,311 --> 00:19:14,111
The patty was amazing. 

540
00:19:14,111 --> 00:19:16,577
It was so tender. 

541
00:19:16,577 --> 00:19:19,344
This is unbelievable. How many slices of cheese? 

542
00:19:19,344 --> 00:19:20,077
How many? 

543
00:19:20,077 --> 00:19:22,111
- If you eat that alone... / - 8? 9? 

544
00:19:22,744 --> 00:19:24,044
You could die if you eat that alone. 

545
00:19:24,044 --> 00:19:25,477
But that looks really good. 

546
00:19:25,477 --> 00:19:26,977
- Putting aside the size... / - Looks so good. 

547
00:19:26,977 --> 00:19:27,677
The grease... 

548
00:19:28,144 --> 00:19:30,577
(The gigantic burger has been served) 

549
00:19:32,111 --> 00:19:33,344
What should I do? 

550
00:19:33,344 --> 00:19:35,077
The patty's thickness... 

551
00:19:35,077 --> 00:19:37,977
- $80? / - It looks like a children's bicycle tire. 

552
00:19:38,777 --> 00:19:39,944
Check this out. 

553
00:19:39,944 --> 00:19:41,844
I wanted to share this with you guys. 

554
00:19:44,844 --> 00:19:46,911
This is worth leaving a photo for. 

555
00:19:47,877 --> 00:19:48,811
You must take one for that. 

556
00:19:48,811 --> 00:19:50,911
Don't you like taking photos? 

557
00:19:50,911 --> 00:19:52,244
- It's fun. / - You should try that. 

558
00:19:52,244 --> 00:19:54,411
Is that a good spot for photos? 

559
00:19:54,411 --> 00:19:55,744
Eat the patty first. 

560
00:19:55,744 --> 00:19:56,477
Like a cake... 

561
00:19:56,477 --> 00:19:57,711
We're going to give you a countdown 

562
00:19:57,711 --> 00:19:59,511
before you cut it, okay? 

563
00:19:59,511 --> 00:20:00,877
5. 

564
00:20:00,877 --> 00:20:02,044
4. 

565
00:20:02,044 --> 00:20:03,044
3. 

566
00:20:03,044 --> 00:20:04,044
2. 

567
00:20:04,044 --> 00:20:05,111
1. 

568
00:20:07,244 --> 00:20:08,377
Oh, my. Wow. 

569
00:20:08,377 --> 00:20:10,044
The patty is thick. 

570
00:20:10,044 --> 00:20:11,944
(They even play a song) 

571
00:20:12,577 --> 00:20:13,611
This is amazing. 

572
00:20:15,377 --> 00:20:17,011
That looks like a cake. 

573
00:20:17,011 --> 00:20:18,511
They're playing the "Rocky" theme. 

574
00:20:19,544 --> 00:20:21,211
They play the song. 

575
00:20:21,211 --> 00:20:22,244
- Is that from the restaurant? / - Really? 

576
00:20:23,177 --> 00:20:24,177
This... 

577
00:20:25,411 --> 00:20:27,111
You should grab it and eat it. 

578
00:20:27,111 --> 00:20:28,177
That's great. 

579
00:20:29,611 --> 00:20:31,611
Don't rush. You got 40 minutes. 

580
00:20:31,611 --> 00:20:32,577
You have a lot of time. 

581
00:20:32,577 --> 00:20:34,644
If you don't rush, you won't be able to finish it. 

582
00:20:36,544 --> 00:20:40,511
(First, just shove it in) 

583
00:20:42,211 --> 00:20:43,711
You have a good start. 

584
00:20:43,711 --> 00:20:45,611
I think you can finish a quarter of it. 

585
00:20:45,611 --> 00:20:47,944
That was a bit hard. 

586
00:20:47,944 --> 00:20:49,344
It doesn't look like you ate any of it. 

587
00:20:53,711 --> 00:20:54,311
Hey, this... 

588
00:20:56,577 --> 00:20:59,144
- You should've had it with ketchup. / - Just relax. 

589
00:20:59,144 --> 00:21:01,411
I'm speechless because I'm stunned. 

590
00:21:01,411 --> 00:21:03,644
How's the meat? Is it tender? 

591
00:21:03,644 --> 00:21:04,244
The meat? Yes. 

592
00:21:04,244 --> 00:21:06,844
The meat is very juicy. 

593
00:21:07,644 --> 00:21:09,311
Hey, I want to 

594
00:21:09,311 --> 00:21:10,611
move this over here. 

595
00:21:12,511 --> 00:21:13,844
That's a good idea. 

596
00:21:14,944 --> 00:21:17,311
You can get sick of it, if there's too much. 

597
00:21:17,311 --> 00:21:19,744
So put some aside. 

598
00:21:21,377 --> 00:21:23,277
(They forgot about Hyungjun's burger) 

599
00:21:25,711 --> 00:21:28,177
The bun looks like a donut. 

600
00:21:29,711 --> 00:21:30,977
(Donut burger, $21.50) 

601
00:21:30,977 --> 00:21:32,044
Look at my burger. 

602
00:21:32,044 --> 00:21:33,977
Do you see the donut on top? 

603
00:21:33,977 --> 00:21:35,177
- That's a donut? / - It's a sweet donut? 

604
00:21:35,177 --> 00:21:36,111
- It's glazed donut? / - Yes. 

605
00:21:36,111 --> 00:21:38,044
It's so delicious with that. 

606
00:21:38,044 --> 00:21:40,044
- So good. / - It is but it's seriously fattening. 

607
00:21:40,044 --> 00:21:40,877
Really? 

608
00:21:40,877 --> 00:21:42,344
- It's so good though. / - It's sweet and salty. 

609
00:21:44,311 --> 00:21:45,711
This is good. 

610
00:21:45,711 --> 00:21:47,011
How did they come up with this? 

611
00:21:47,011 --> 00:21:49,344
Do you think they have pickles? 

612
00:21:49,344 --> 00:21:50,977
You don't have any room for pickles. 

613
00:21:50,977 --> 00:21:52,044
Just eat it. 

614
00:21:52,044 --> 00:21:53,644
Yeah, I'll have the onions instead. 

615
00:21:54,677 --> 00:21:56,411
(They eat simultaneously) 

616
00:21:56,411 --> 00:21:58,444
(I don't think I can eat that) 

617
00:21:58,844 --> 00:22:01,111
I think the patty itself would weigh 

618
00:22:01,111 --> 00:22:02,677
at least 2.4kg. 

619
00:22:03,344 --> 00:22:04,411
2.4 to 3kg. 

620
00:22:04,877 --> 00:22:06,944
You're amazing if you can finish half of it. 

621
00:22:08,644 --> 00:22:11,444
(Jonghyuk starts devouring again) 

622
00:22:12,244 --> 00:22:14,477
I want him to succeed. 

623
00:22:19,011 --> 00:22:21,677
(Hyungjun is eating gracefully) 

624
00:22:21,677 --> 00:22:23,044
It's really annoying, the way you eat. 

625
00:22:23,044 --> 00:22:23,911
Right. 

626
00:22:23,911 --> 00:22:25,744
He is very relaxed. 

627
00:22:25,744 --> 00:22:26,944
He's like a coach. 

628
00:22:28,744 --> 00:22:29,944
I'm jealous. 

629
00:22:29,944 --> 00:22:31,344
- Why? / - Because you're almost done. 

630
00:22:31,344 --> 00:22:32,477
I want more. 

631
00:22:35,111 --> 00:22:36,944
Why does it look like it's increasing? 

632
00:22:36,944 --> 00:22:38,077
- Right? / - The size... 

633
00:22:38,077 --> 00:22:39,144
Since he's opened it up, 

634
00:22:39,144 --> 00:22:40,844
it looks like there's more. 

635
00:22:48,344 --> 00:22:49,777
Hey, don't drink cola. 

636
00:22:51,877 --> 00:22:53,211
Try eating this burger! 

637
00:22:53,211 --> 00:22:54,244
I'm super thirsty. 

638
00:22:54,744 --> 00:22:55,977
Think back to the days when you were 

639
00:22:55,977 --> 00:22:56,811
cold and hungry. 

640
00:23:00,677 --> 00:23:02,377
I really want more. 

641
00:23:03,377 --> 00:23:04,777
This was so little. 

642
00:23:04,777 --> 00:23:05,711
Eat some of mine. 

643
00:23:06,244 --> 00:23:08,611
(Have some of mine) 

644
00:23:08,611 --> 00:23:11,177
One more donut burger please. 

645
00:23:11,177 --> 00:23:13,444
Hey, try mine. 

646
00:23:13,444 --> 00:23:14,411
Please one more. 

647
00:23:15,344 --> 00:23:16,477
Yeah, one more. 

648
00:23:16,477 --> 00:23:17,311
Hey. 

649
00:23:17,311 --> 00:23:18,344
- I ordered another. / - I've failed. 

650
00:23:18,344 --> 00:23:19,411
I've really failed. 

651
00:23:19,411 --> 00:23:21,211
- You have lots of time. / - Hey, don't. 

652
00:23:21,211 --> 00:23:22,811
- Why not? / - Try to the end. 

653
00:23:22,811 --> 00:23:24,344
It's only been 8 minutes. 

654
00:23:24,344 --> 00:23:26,077
If only 8 minutes have passed... 

655
00:23:26,077 --> 00:23:27,277
- Just eat slowly. / - He should keep going. 

656
00:23:27,277 --> 00:23:28,744
He'll get sick of it. 

657
00:23:28,744 --> 00:23:30,411
You're representing Korea. 

658
00:23:30,411 --> 00:23:31,444
You have to try to the end. 

659
00:23:33,644 --> 00:23:36,244
It wouldn't be too bad if the patty wasn't so thick. 

660
00:23:37,111 --> 00:23:38,877
The patty is like smoked ham. 

661
00:23:42,177 --> 00:23:43,411
The heater isn't on, is it? 

662
00:23:43,411 --> 00:23:45,844
I'm not eating hot soup but I'm sweating. 

663
00:23:45,844 --> 00:23:47,911
You ate about a fifth of it. 

664
00:23:47,911 --> 00:23:49,344
- Really? Did I eat a lot? / - Yes. 

665
00:23:50,277 --> 00:23:52,477
(He glances over) 

666
00:23:53,777 --> 00:23:55,544
There's still half of it left. 

667
00:23:55,544 --> 00:23:56,544
Don't look at that. 

668
00:23:56,544 --> 00:23:58,211
Just look at what's on your plate. 

669
00:23:58,211 --> 00:23:59,277
Don't look. Just eat. 

670
00:24:04,577 --> 00:24:06,477
- I really wanted this. / - So... 

671
00:24:06,477 --> 00:24:09,744
- He still has the urge to finish. / - It's so small. 

672
00:24:10,611 --> 00:24:12,277
Did you order another one because it was so good? 

673
00:24:16,377 --> 00:24:18,477
(This is hard) 

674
00:24:18,477 --> 00:24:20,144
I feel stuffy just watching this. 

675
00:24:20,711 --> 00:24:22,144
It gives you a stomachache, right? 

676
00:24:22,144 --> 00:24:23,344
I can't even be bothered to cut it now. 

677
00:24:26,777 --> 00:24:27,611
How many minutes do I have left? 

678
00:24:27,611 --> 00:24:28,977
(23 minutes) 

679
00:24:28,977 --> 00:24:30,344
23 minutes? 

680
00:24:30,344 --> 00:24:31,977
Try harder. 

681
00:24:31,977 --> 00:24:35,111
You're leaving the meat and only eating vegetables. 

682
00:24:35,111 --> 00:24:37,344
- The patty is so thick. / - That's too thin. 

683
00:24:37,344 --> 00:24:38,277
It's this big. 

684
00:24:38,277 --> 00:24:39,411
I'm going to eat it like boiled pork. 

685
00:24:39,977 --> 00:24:41,011
A triple set. 

686
00:24:41,011 --> 00:24:42,144
With the vegetables. 

687
00:24:42,711 --> 00:24:43,577
Triple set? 

688
00:24:43,577 --> 00:24:45,611
The next meal won't be easy. 

689
00:24:45,611 --> 00:24:47,377
Is there a hospital nearby? 

690
00:24:47,377 --> 00:24:48,777
A hospital nearby... 

691
00:24:48,777 --> 00:24:51,144
You're representing Korea. 

692
00:24:51,144 --> 00:24:53,711
- You should eat at least half. / - I don't care for that. 

693
00:24:53,711 --> 00:24:55,777
I have a shoot when I go back to Seoul. 

694
00:24:55,777 --> 00:24:57,211
I can't gain weight. 

695
00:24:57,211 --> 00:24:59,177
I can't eat at a restaurant for a long time. 

696
00:24:59,177 --> 00:25:01,344
Failure is the stepping stone to success. 

697
00:25:01,344 --> 00:25:02,944
Actually, 

698
00:25:02,944 --> 00:25:04,811
I ate breakfast at the hotel. 

699
00:25:06,611 --> 00:25:07,511
Is it that hard? 

700
00:25:08,844 --> 00:25:10,777
(He cringes) 

701
00:25:12,277 --> 00:25:13,744
Just finish the meat. 

702
00:25:13,744 --> 00:25:15,144
Do we need to keep watching? 

703
00:25:16,244 --> 00:25:17,311
Obviously, he failed. 

704
00:25:17,311 --> 00:25:18,711
Must we watch all 40 minutes? 

705
00:25:18,711 --> 00:25:20,611
That's how tough it is. 

706
00:25:20,611 --> 00:25:23,044
You should think hard about it. 

707
00:25:23,911 --> 00:25:26,411
- I'd better give up. / - Let's walk out quietly. 

708
00:25:26,411 --> 00:25:27,377
I give up. 

709
00:25:27,377 --> 00:25:29,077
He's giving up. 

710
00:25:30,644 --> 00:25:31,644
Goodness. 

711
00:25:31,644 --> 00:25:33,477
- She's bringing out the toilet seat. / - Yeah. 

712
00:25:35,011 --> 00:25:36,811
Man vs. Food. Food has won. 

713
00:25:36,811 --> 00:25:38,444
Let's give him  a big round of applause. 

714
00:25:41,711 --> 00:25:43,144
- There's his picture. / - Did they put it up there? 

715
00:25:43,144 --> 00:25:44,544
So if we visit... 

716
00:25:44,544 --> 00:25:45,611
- It's there. / - We can see his photo? 

717
00:25:45,611 --> 00:25:46,511
- Yes. / - It's up there. 

718
00:25:48,644 --> 00:25:50,111
Now that we're done eating... 

719
00:25:50,111 --> 00:25:51,477
We'll look around the city. 

720
00:25:54,244 --> 00:25:55,511
This is Abbey Road. 

721
00:25:56,677 --> 00:25:58,177
Are you finally going there to take pictures? 

722
00:26:01,811 --> 00:26:03,911
This is... 

723
00:26:03,911 --> 00:26:05,244
Abbey Road. 

724
00:26:05,244 --> 00:26:07,411
There's a famous picture where 

725
00:26:07,411 --> 00:26:08,577
they're crossing the street. 

726
00:26:08,577 --> 00:26:09,411
- Abbey Road? / - Yes. 

727
00:26:09,411 --> 00:26:11,144
- The jacket photo. / - You've seen it. 

728
00:26:11,144 --> 00:26:13,677
- The Beatles walked across... / - The crosswalk. 

729
00:26:13,677 --> 00:26:15,711
People copy that. 

730
00:26:19,744 --> 00:26:21,411
It's worn down a lot. 

731
00:26:21,411 --> 00:26:22,244
It's here. 

732
00:26:23,077 --> 00:26:25,244
The Beatles. Elton John. 

733
00:26:25,244 --> 00:26:27,477
Many people recorded there. 

734
00:26:27,477 --> 00:26:30,111
That space is great for 

735
00:26:30,111 --> 00:26:31,677
recording classical music. 

736
00:26:31,677 --> 00:26:34,511
Chang Hanna recorded there too. 

737
00:26:34,511 --> 00:26:36,344
At the Abbey Road Studios. 

738
00:26:37,244 --> 00:26:37,977
There. 

739
00:26:37,977 --> 00:26:39,011
So that's the spot. 

740
00:26:39,011 --> 00:26:41,711
The Abbey Road Studios is there. 

741
00:26:41,711 --> 00:26:43,977
That was the last place 

742
00:26:43,977 --> 00:26:45,844
where all four members 

743
00:26:45,844 --> 00:26:47,877
recorded together. 

744
00:26:47,877 --> 00:26:49,411
There are drawings on the wall. 

745
00:26:49,411 --> 00:26:50,177
Look. 

746
00:26:51,011 --> 00:26:52,411
There's the studio. 

747
00:26:53,511 --> 00:26:54,644
People wrote stuff. 

748
00:26:54,644 --> 00:26:55,644
Is that the studio? 

749
00:26:55,644 --> 00:26:57,577
They painted over it. 

750
00:26:57,577 --> 00:26:59,277
These are all written by visitors. 

751
00:26:59,277 --> 00:27:01,477
There's a museum of the studio 

752
00:27:01,477 --> 00:27:03,411
in Liverpool. 

753
00:27:03,411 --> 00:27:04,611
They kept it the same. 

754
00:27:04,611 --> 00:27:07,311
People from all over the world write on that wall. 

755
00:27:08,377 --> 00:27:09,844
One unfortunate thing is 

756
00:27:09,844 --> 00:27:11,511
they paint it over after a week 

757
00:27:11,511 --> 00:27:12,977
because it gets filled up. 

758
00:27:13,744 --> 00:27:15,244
So the writings don't last long. 

759
00:27:16,011 --> 00:27:19,177
So this is the studio where The Beatles recorded. 

760
00:27:19,177 --> 00:27:22,277
That's where they took the picture. 

761
00:27:22,277 --> 00:27:24,377
Just like those people. 

762
00:27:24,377 --> 00:27:25,944
They are walking across and taking pictures. 

763
00:27:29,444 --> 00:27:30,611
I can't believe I'm here. 

764
00:27:32,977 --> 00:27:34,411
This is the road. 

765
00:27:34,411 --> 00:27:36,344
- Shouldn't we walk across it? / - Yes. 

766
00:27:36,344 --> 00:27:38,077
- Is this it? / - Yes. 

767
00:27:40,544 --> 00:27:41,744
Don't we need two more? 

768
00:27:41,744 --> 00:27:43,544
It looks good when there are four. 

769
00:27:43,544 --> 00:27:45,011
- You're right. / - That's right. 

770
00:27:45,011 --> 00:27:46,544
Let's just go, the two of us. 

771
00:27:46,544 --> 00:27:48,844
We have to match our strides. 

772
00:27:48,844 --> 00:27:49,944
If you see the picture, 

773
00:27:49,944 --> 00:27:51,511
they walk the same. 

774
00:27:52,211 --> 00:27:52,844
We served in the army. 

775
00:27:52,844 --> 00:27:55,111
- Like marching in the army. / - Left foot first. 

776
00:27:56,077 --> 00:27:57,644
- Let's go when there's no car. / - Go. 

777
00:27:57,644 --> 00:27:59,177
- Left foot. / - Left foot. 

778
00:27:59,177 --> 00:28:01,144
- Hands like this. / - Left foot. 

779
00:28:01,144 --> 00:28:02,244
Left foot. 

780
00:28:02,977 --> 00:28:04,611
He said it with so much confidence. 

781
00:28:05,911 --> 00:28:07,344
That doesn't look good. 

782
00:28:07,344 --> 00:28:09,611
- It's the camera. / - I think it's because of this. 

783
00:28:10,844 --> 00:28:12,011
- The road... / - Go now. 

784
00:28:12,011 --> 00:28:13,311
The think the road became narrower. 

785
00:28:13,311 --> 00:28:14,111
Let's go now. 

786
00:28:15,144 --> 00:28:15,844
This is it. 

787
00:28:18,377 --> 00:28:19,711
I'm a bit embarrassed. 

788
00:28:19,711 --> 00:28:20,444
Why? 

789
00:28:20,444 --> 00:28:23,111
- You have to get that photo. / - You went all the way. 

790
00:28:23,111 --> 00:28:25,044
Travelers from all over the world do that. 

791
00:28:26,211 --> 00:28:28,077
Also, thing is... 

792
00:28:28,077 --> 00:28:30,177
These lights... 

793
00:28:30,177 --> 00:28:31,544
They mean... 

794
00:28:31,544 --> 00:28:32,211
Pedestrians first. 

795
00:28:32,211 --> 00:28:34,644
We walk on a green light, right? 

796
00:28:34,644 --> 00:28:36,544
But this place is so famous. 

797
00:28:37,511 --> 00:28:38,777
The cars all stop. 

798
00:28:38,777 --> 00:28:40,077
- For the people? / - Yeah, let's go now. 

799
00:28:40,077 --> 00:28:41,011
- Go. / - Go. 

800
00:28:41,011 --> 00:28:41,711
Go. 

801
00:28:44,277 --> 00:28:46,044
Don't look around. 

802
00:28:46,044 --> 00:28:47,677
The Beatles just looked straight ahead. 

803
00:28:50,377 --> 00:28:52,677
- Why am I so embarrassed? / - Don't look left, right. 

804
00:28:53,444 --> 00:28:55,477
Jonghyuk is super embarrassed. 

805
00:28:55,477 --> 00:28:56,477
It was embarrassing. 

806
00:28:58,744 --> 00:28:59,811
Good, good. 

807
00:28:59,811 --> 00:29:00,444
There's no one else around. 

808
00:29:00,444 --> 00:29:01,811
- You got the shot. / - There are no cars. 

809
00:29:01,811 --> 00:29:06,377
(We added the two other members for you) 

810
00:29:07,711 --> 00:29:08,711
That's nice. 

811
00:29:12,977 --> 00:29:14,211
We should just do all these. 

812
00:29:15,444 --> 00:29:18,544
Oh, this London Slide... 

813
00:29:20,311 --> 00:29:22,211
(London Slide?) 

814
00:29:22,711 --> 00:29:23,811
London Slide. 

815
00:29:24,611 --> 00:29:26,711
It's seems different to other rides. 

816
00:29:27,677 --> 00:29:29,311
This really looks scary. 

817
00:29:29,311 --> 00:29:30,544
I want to try this. 

818
00:29:30,544 --> 00:29:31,677
If your ride that after eating the burger, 

819
00:29:31,677 --> 00:29:32,511
you'll throw up. 

820
00:29:33,644 --> 00:29:36,044
That's what you were talking about earlier. 

821
00:29:42,911 --> 00:29:43,811
Check that out. 

822
00:29:43,811 --> 00:29:44,944
That's what we're riding. 

823
00:29:44,944 --> 00:29:46,277
- See that spiral thing? / - Like a twisted bread stick. 

824
00:29:46,277 --> 00:29:48,077
- Like a spring. / - We must drop from that. 

825
00:29:48,077 --> 00:29:49,577
That looks really scary. 

826
00:29:49,577 --> 00:29:51,311
That's the tallest slide in the world. 

827
00:29:51,311 --> 00:29:52,644
- That slide? / - Yes. 

828
00:29:53,411 --> 00:29:55,011
I'm scared. 

829
00:29:56,911 --> 00:29:58,944
(It's the tallest and the longest slide) 

830
00:29:59,144 --> 00:30:01,511
(76m high, roughly 30 stories tall) 

831
00:30:01,511 --> 00:30:04,311
(It takes 40 seconds to slide down) 

832
00:30:05,177 --> 00:30:06,211
That looks like fun. 

833
00:30:06,844 --> 00:30:07,377
It's no joke. 

834
00:30:07,377 --> 00:30:09,311
- It looks fun. / - That's so long. 

835
00:30:09,311 --> 00:30:10,611
It's the largest in the world. 

836
00:30:11,111 --> 00:30:14,477
(The London Slide is the largest in the world) 

837
00:30:14,477 --> 00:30:15,477
They did this for the Olympics? 

838
00:30:19,244 --> 00:30:21,377
- These must be the designers. / - Must be. 

839
00:30:21,377 --> 00:30:23,844
They did it for the Olympics. 

840
00:30:23,844 --> 00:30:25,144
Then they built it... 

841
00:30:26,111 --> 00:30:28,211
So that people could keep coming. 

842
00:30:31,011 --> 00:30:32,711
That looks so pretty with the lights on. 

843
00:30:33,177 --> 00:30:34,511
It's taller than the Statue of Liberty. 

844
00:30:39,011 --> 00:30:42,177
It's taller than the Statue of Liberty. 

845
00:30:45,144 --> 00:30:45,877
It's so... 

846
00:30:45,877 --> 00:30:47,144
It looks fun. 

847
00:30:49,044 --> 00:30:49,977
Are we already here? 

848
00:30:49,977 --> 00:30:50,811
It's quite high. 

849
00:30:51,577 --> 00:30:53,011
This is awesome. 

850
00:30:53,944 --> 00:30:54,677
It's nice. 

851
00:30:55,577 --> 00:30:57,644
The observatory is nice. 

852
00:30:59,144 --> 00:31:00,477
That is what a view should be like. 

853
00:31:02,244 --> 00:31:02,644
That's it. 

854
00:31:02,644 --> 00:31:04,444
You can see the entire downtown of London. 

855
00:31:04,444 --> 00:31:05,777
Right here... 

856
00:31:05,777 --> 00:31:07,211
Another soccer field.! 

857
00:31:08,244 --> 00:31:10,611
If you don't play, you lose. Rock, paper, scissors. 

858
00:31:10,611 --> 00:31:12,844
If you don't play, you lose. Rock, paper, scissors. 

859
00:31:14,577 --> 00:31:15,377
Rock, paper, scissors. 

860
00:31:15,377 --> 00:31:17,244
(Jonghyuk wins) 

861
00:31:18,811 --> 00:31:20,611
(Upset) 

862
00:31:20,611 --> 00:31:21,777
Why do you have to wear a helmet? 

863
00:31:21,777 --> 00:31:24,277
For safety. 

864
00:31:24,277 --> 00:31:25,577
They said you had to wear it. 

865
00:31:25,577 --> 00:31:28,177
- You sit inside. / - Looks like we go in here. 

866
00:31:28,177 --> 00:31:28,544
He says to go in. 

867
00:31:28,544 --> 00:31:30,211
- Now? / - Yes. 

868
00:31:31,677 --> 00:31:34,111
Bring your feet right to the bottom. 

869
00:31:34,111 --> 00:31:35,277
Like when we were kids... 

870
00:31:35,277 --> 00:31:38,611
- The rice sacks. / - Like sliding down in rice sacks. 

871
00:31:38,611 --> 00:31:41,577
- Since it can get hot from friction? / - That's right. 

872
00:31:42,111 --> 00:31:43,311
Sometimes you can see and sometimes you can't. 

873
00:31:43,311 --> 00:31:44,177
Is he going down now? 

874
00:31:44,177 --> 00:31:46,077
- It'd be scary since you can't see. / - You can't see. 

875
00:31:46,677 --> 00:31:49,011
That's it. You pull in. 

876
00:31:49,011 --> 00:31:49,711
He says to pull this. 

877
00:31:49,711 --> 00:31:50,844
Just grab this? 

878
00:31:50,844 --> 00:31:52,277
Grab and pull. 

879
00:31:52,277 --> 00:31:53,277
(Scared) 

880
00:31:55,977 --> 00:31:56,744
Wait a minute. 

881
00:31:57,944 --> 00:31:58,644
Are you afraid? 

882
00:31:59,544 --> 00:32:01,044
This is scary. 

883
00:32:02,377 --> 00:32:03,744
Good-bye. 

884
00:32:06,177 --> 00:32:09,377
You can hear the screams... 

885
00:32:09,377 --> 00:32:09,811
Till the end. 

886
00:32:11,077 --> 00:32:12,244
Look at that sudden acceleration. 

887
00:32:12,977 --> 00:32:14,811
(He is screaming a lot) 

888
00:32:16,344 --> 00:32:18,011
(Ahhhh) 

889
00:32:19,744 --> 00:32:21,577
The important thing is you can see the outside? 

890
00:32:21,577 --> 00:32:22,477
You can and then can't. 

891
00:32:22,577 --> 00:32:25,044
There are areas where you can. 

892
00:32:25,044 --> 00:32:27,344
Goodness. It's crazy that you can see the outside. 

893
00:32:31,077 --> 00:32:33,144
Isn't he acting? 

894
00:32:33,144 --> 00:32:34,077
Isn't he acting? 

895
00:32:36,611 --> 00:32:37,577
It looks fun. 

896
00:32:39,277 --> 00:32:40,311
Hyungjun. 

897
00:32:41,044 --> 00:32:42,011
Are you okay? 

898
00:32:43,877 --> 00:32:44,677
It looks scary. 

899
00:32:44,677 --> 00:32:45,744
It was too long. 

900
00:32:46,611 --> 00:32:49,044
After around 3 screams... 

901
00:32:49,044 --> 00:32:50,411
- It's usually over. / - I can still hear him. 

902
00:32:50,411 --> 00:32:51,311
He must still be going down. 

903
00:32:54,011 --> 00:32:54,977
He's doing well. 

904
00:32:55,811 --> 00:32:56,677
Still... 

905
00:32:57,411 --> 00:32:58,177
Seriously. 

906
00:32:58,177 --> 00:32:59,311
After a few screams... 

907
00:32:59,311 --> 00:33:00,877
- It takes ages. / - 178m. 

908
00:33:02,511 --> 00:33:04,544
He's going down for about 200m. 

909
00:33:06,311 --> 00:33:07,177
This isn't a joke. 

910
00:33:07,977 --> 00:33:09,077
Look at his face. 

911
00:33:10,544 --> 00:33:11,944
He's so ugly. 

912
00:33:13,911 --> 00:33:15,244
Jonghyuk's in trouble. 

913
00:33:17,911 --> 00:33:19,244
- Are you ready? / - Yeah. 

914
00:33:19,244 --> 00:33:20,244
Good. 

915
00:33:20,244 --> 00:33:21,211
Sit down. 

916
00:33:23,911 --> 00:33:25,277
(He's ready) 

917
00:33:27,511 --> 00:33:28,844
You can go down now. 

918
00:33:29,744 --> 00:33:30,444
Geez. 

919
00:33:33,911 --> 00:33:35,611
Even Hyungjun survived. I won't die. 

920
00:33:37,077 --> 00:33:38,677
But this is a little scary. 

921
00:33:39,777 --> 00:33:41,744
(He gives him a gentle push) 

922
00:33:41,744 --> 00:33:44,077
(He starts screaming from the start) 

923
00:33:44,077 --> 00:33:46,111
(Argh) 

924
00:33:47,144 --> 00:33:49,077
Look at that, it's really fast. 

925
00:33:54,311 --> 00:33:55,411
I can hear him screaming. 

926
00:33:59,377 --> 00:34:00,277
That looks fun. 

927
00:34:00,277 --> 00:34:02,077
- It must be really scary. / - That looks fun. 

928
00:34:02,077 --> 00:34:03,477
It must be real scary. 

929
00:34:03,477 --> 00:34:05,011
I'm still going down. 

930
00:34:05,011 --> 00:34:05,611
No... 

931
00:34:08,644 --> 00:34:11,177
You'll go down faster if you're heavy. 

932
00:34:13,077 --> 00:34:13,811
What is this? 

933
00:34:17,544 --> 00:34:18,211
Hey... 

934
00:34:18,211 --> 00:34:19,411
- What's going on? / - What? 

935
00:34:19,411 --> 00:34:20,611
- What? / - At the end. 

936
00:34:20,611 --> 00:34:22,211
What do I do? 

937
00:34:22,211 --> 00:34:23,777
Hey, pull me out or something. 

938
00:34:24,977 --> 00:34:26,511
Hey, pull me out or something. 

939
00:34:26,511 --> 00:34:27,777
Swim out. 

940
00:34:30,577 --> 00:34:31,544
What is this? 

941
00:34:33,011 --> 00:34:35,377
(Crawling) 

942
00:34:37,811 --> 00:34:38,711
No joke, right? 

943
00:34:39,611 --> 00:34:41,311
Is this supposed to be sad? 

944
00:34:41,311 --> 00:34:42,144
It's sad. 

945
00:34:42,144 --> 00:34:43,644
I was shocked. 

946
00:34:44,477 --> 00:34:45,444
It's scary. 

947
00:34:45,444 --> 00:34:46,611
I was shocked. 

948
00:34:47,711 --> 00:34:48,644
I slid down for ages. 

949
00:34:48,644 --> 00:34:50,511
- It's really fun. / - It is. 

950
00:34:50,511 --> 00:34:51,811
You said there's something else to see. 

951
00:34:52,444 --> 00:34:53,144
The next destination. 

952
00:34:53,144 --> 00:34:53,944
Yeah, let's hurry. 

953
00:34:53,944 --> 00:34:55,577
- It's starting to rain. / - Let's go. 

954
00:34:58,277 --> 00:34:59,344
Can kids right it too? 

955
00:34:59,344 --> 00:35:00,611
If they're over 130cm. 

956
00:35:00,611 --> 00:35:01,444
And older than 8 years. 

957
00:35:01,444 --> 00:35:02,944
130cm... 

958
00:35:02,944 --> 00:35:04,677
- You have to be taller than 130cm. / - Ice rink! 

959
00:35:04,677 --> 00:35:06,277
This must be like city hall. 

960
00:35:06,277 --> 00:35:07,344
Like city hall plaza. 

961
00:35:07,344 --> 00:35:08,411
Skating... 

962
00:35:08,411 --> 00:35:10,277
- I'm good. / - Ice rink. 

963
00:35:10,277 --> 00:35:12,411
But the two of us at an ice rink... 

964
00:35:14,611 --> 00:35:16,511
- An ice rink? / - I've never tried. 

965
00:35:17,144 --> 00:35:19,411
- Just like Seoul City Hall. / - Yes. 

966
00:35:19,411 --> 00:35:20,511
Just go to Seoul. 

967
00:35:20,511 --> 00:35:22,177
- You can't compare. / - I'm good with roller skates. 

968
00:35:22,177 --> 00:35:24,144
- It's all the same. / - Really? 

969
00:35:25,377 --> 00:35:26,311
- Must we... / - Yeah. 

970
00:35:26,311 --> 00:35:27,677
You really want to do this? 

971
00:35:27,677 --> 00:35:29,311
We just have to not hold hands. 

972
00:35:29,311 --> 00:35:31,577
Why would you go to an ice rink in England? 

973
00:35:32,211 --> 00:35:34,311
The women would love this place. 

974
00:35:34,311 --> 00:35:35,344
Why? 

975
00:35:35,344 --> 00:35:36,311
It's really nice. 

976
00:35:38,277 --> 00:35:41,611
(ArcelorMittal Orbit) 

977
00:35:41,611 --> 00:35:43,711
(50 minutes by car to the Natural History Museum) 

978
00:35:45,577 --> 00:35:48,944
This is the trendiest place in London during winter. 

979
00:35:48,944 --> 00:35:50,777
There's a carousel and an ice rink... 

980
00:35:50,777 --> 00:35:52,377
This would be great to come with family. 

981
00:35:52,377 --> 00:35:54,211
It's outdoors. 

982
00:35:54,211 --> 00:35:55,544
You can always see places like this in the movies. 

983
00:35:55,544 --> 00:35:57,211
Yes, they're in movies. 

984
00:35:58,011 --> 00:35:58,944
Can you do this? 

985
00:35:58,944 --> 00:35:59,911
I'll be fine. 

986
00:35:59,911 --> 00:36:01,244
I'm not in the right condition 

987
00:36:01,244 --> 00:36:02,777
to show you my triple axel though. 

988
00:36:04,377 --> 00:36:06,844
This was the Natural History Museum. 

989
00:36:07,944 --> 00:36:09,211
It was in a lot of movies like... 

990
00:36:09,211 --> 00:36:10,811
"Night at the Museum." 

991
00:36:10,811 --> 00:36:13,544
It's the ice rink next to it. 

992
00:36:13,544 --> 00:36:15,311
Figure means 

993
00:36:15,311 --> 00:36:16,877
appearance and shape. 

994
00:36:16,877 --> 00:36:19,044
The English aristocrats of old... 

995
00:36:19,044 --> 00:36:20,311
- Figure. / - They used to... 

996
00:36:20,311 --> 00:36:23,044
To draw shapes in the ice with a blade. 

997
00:36:23,044 --> 00:36:25,477
They used to skate while drawing on the ice. 

998
00:36:25,477 --> 00:36:26,877
That's why it's called figure skating. 

999
00:36:29,011 --> 00:36:30,411
(Natural History Museum Ice Rink) 

1000
00:36:30,411 --> 00:36:32,344
(It's only open during the Christmas season) 

1001
00:36:32,344 --> 00:36:34,277
(The most popular ice rink in London) 

1002
00:36:35,877 --> 00:36:37,677
(Ice rink, $23 per person) 

1003
00:36:37,677 --> 00:36:38,777
I don't think I can skate. 

1004
00:36:43,444 --> 00:36:44,644
It looks easy. 

1005
00:36:45,544 --> 00:36:46,544
Be careful. 

1006
00:36:48,444 --> 00:36:51,977
(Steps on) 

1007
00:36:52,944 --> 00:36:54,244
It's so slippery. 

1008
00:36:54,244 --> 00:36:55,577
I don't think I can do this. 

1009
00:36:57,344 --> 00:36:58,077
Are you okay? 

1010
00:37:00,477 --> 00:37:01,377
I can't do this... 

1011
00:37:02,011 --> 00:37:03,177
How do you do this? 

1012
00:37:03,177 --> 00:37:04,944
(Just go?) 

1013
00:37:07,977 --> 00:37:09,444
Where is Hyungjun? 

1014
00:37:09,444 --> 00:37:10,244
Where did he go? 

1015
00:37:10,244 --> 00:37:12,844
(He's here) 

1016
00:37:12,844 --> 00:37:13,811
Someone's crawling. 

1017
00:37:13,811 --> 00:37:15,677
The only one that's falling over. 

1018
00:37:15,677 --> 00:37:16,911
I don't like this. 

1019
00:37:18,711 --> 00:37:21,011
It would've been great to go with a lover. 

1020
00:37:21,011 --> 00:37:22,744
- That's right. / - I'm good on roller skates. 

1021
00:37:22,744 --> 00:37:23,711
It's all the same. 

1022
00:37:24,744 --> 00:37:28,911
(Skating was the easiest thing in the world for him?) 

1023
00:37:29,811 --> 00:37:32,511
(Oh, my God) 

1024
00:37:33,211 --> 00:37:35,511
(This won't do) 

1025
00:37:38,544 --> 00:37:40,344
(Peek-a-boo) 

1026
00:37:41,477 --> 00:37:43,577
That is for beginners. 

1027
00:37:43,577 --> 00:37:45,844
- They hold it while skating. / - That's a good idea. 

1028
00:37:46,344 --> 00:37:48,877
(I'm Kim Yuna with the penguin) 

1029
00:37:51,744 --> 00:37:54,077
(Lim Hyungjun acquired skating skills) 

1030
00:37:59,044 --> 00:38:00,711
I almost went to the opposite way. 

1031
00:38:00,711 --> 00:38:01,811
I almost died. 

1032
00:38:03,577 --> 00:38:05,011
It was against my will. 

1033
00:38:07,544 --> 00:38:09,377
- Oh, my. / - What will he do? 

1034
00:38:12,344 --> 00:38:13,244
No one saw it. 

1035
00:38:13,911 --> 00:38:15,577
It's like nothing has happened. 

1036
00:38:16,711 --> 00:38:17,911
Jonghyuk, can't you skate at all? 

1037
00:38:17,911 --> 00:38:19,611
- I can't. / - I can't do this. 

1038
00:38:22,244 --> 00:38:23,677
I'm not riding the skates. 

1039
00:38:23,677 --> 00:38:25,544
The skates will give me a ride. 

1040
00:38:27,611 --> 00:38:30,711
(The skates that are giving Jonghyuk a ride) 

1041
00:38:32,944 --> 00:38:36,111
(Did I come to England for this?) 

1042
00:38:37,677 --> 00:38:40,877
(Jonghyuk is just assisting) 

1043
00:38:40,877 --> 00:38:44,877
(The skates are carrying him) 

1044
00:38:47,211 --> 00:38:52,277
(If I can't skate, I should at least be funny) 

1045
00:38:55,577 --> 00:38:57,144
It's my first time in 10 years. 

1046
00:39:00,711 --> 00:39:01,977
If you ride this when you're old, 

1047
00:39:01,977 --> 00:39:03,011
you're knees will go out. 

1048
00:39:05,177 --> 00:39:09,344
(He is very noticeable from far away) 

1049
00:39:11,911 --> 00:39:13,111
Are you okay? 

1050
00:39:13,111 --> 00:39:15,044
My whole body is tired already. 

1051
00:39:15,044 --> 00:39:18,411
Skating in England seems romantic. 

1052
00:39:18,411 --> 00:39:20,111
The atmosphere was nice. 

1053
00:39:20,111 --> 00:39:23,544
Why didn't you grab each other's waists at least? 

1054
00:39:23,544 --> 00:39:27,144
The cafes and restaurants right next 

1055
00:39:27,144 --> 00:39:31,344
to the ice rink were pretty. 

1056
00:39:31,344 --> 00:39:33,044
You can drink wine there. 

1057
00:39:33,044 --> 00:39:35,144
(And) 

1058
00:39:35,144 --> 00:39:36,377
Hey! 

1059
00:39:41,711 --> 00:39:44,044
(I'll stand behind you) 

1060
00:39:44,044 --> 00:39:46,444
This is tough. We'll lose at this rate. 

1061
00:39:47,711 --> 00:39:48,444
Right? 

1062
00:39:48,444 --> 00:39:51,211
- Think of the ambience. / - What ambience? 

1063
00:39:51,211 --> 00:39:52,344
How good is it? 

1064
00:39:52,344 --> 00:39:55,344
It's only like that because it's London... 

1065
00:39:55,344 --> 00:39:57,644
Good, good. 

1066
00:39:59,311 --> 00:40:00,277
Keep going. 

1067
00:40:01,911 --> 00:40:04,877
There are women who are skating hand in hand. 

1068
00:40:04,877 --> 00:40:06,677
Just women... 

1069
00:40:09,477 --> 00:40:17,744
(They became closer while holding hands) 

1070
00:40:20,177 --> 00:40:24,077
(It's okay even if we're a male couple) 

1071
00:40:26,744 --> 00:40:28,044
It's in front of the ice rink. 

1072
00:40:28,044 --> 00:40:31,011
- You can see the ice rink. / - Yes. 

1073
00:40:32,744 --> 00:40:34,944
This is called mulled wine. 

1074
00:40:34,944 --> 00:40:37,444
It's wine mixed with spices. 

1075
00:40:37,444 --> 00:40:39,911
You drink it warm. 

1076
00:40:39,911 --> 00:40:41,244
Oh, warm wine. 

1077
00:40:41,244 --> 00:40:42,577
That was so good. 

1078
00:40:42,577 --> 00:40:43,777
It was my first time. 

1079
00:40:43,777 --> 00:40:45,244
- Mulled wine. / - It looks good. 

1080
00:40:45,777 --> 00:40:48,411
(Mulled wine, $9 per glass) 

1081
00:40:48,411 --> 00:40:49,777
This is nice. 

1082
00:40:49,777 --> 00:40:51,544
- They have this in Namsan. / - Really? 

1083
00:40:51,544 --> 00:40:54,311
- It's good for colds. / - It has spices. 

1084
00:40:54,311 --> 00:40:56,011
It's warm wine. 

1085
00:40:56,011 --> 00:40:59,611
It says it helps you stay healthy and get rid of cold. 

1086
00:40:59,611 --> 00:41:02,477
It's called mulled wine in the U.K. 

1087
00:41:02,477 --> 00:41:04,477
And it's called vin chaud in France. 

1088
00:41:04,477 --> 00:41:07,511
- Does it... / - In Germany, gluhwein. 

1089
00:41:07,511 --> 00:41:09,844
- Does it have alcohol in it? / - Of course it does. 

1090
00:41:10,677 --> 00:41:11,977
It's like herbal medicinal tea. 

1091
00:41:12,511 --> 00:41:13,811
Herbal medicinal tea? 

1092
00:41:13,811 --> 00:41:16,844
When Europeans catch a cold, 

1093
00:41:16,844 --> 00:41:18,511
they drink this to warm up their bodies. 

1094
00:41:18,511 --> 00:41:20,277
It's made with mediocre wine, 

1095
00:41:20,277 --> 00:41:23,077
orange peel, cinnamon and so on. 

1096
00:41:23,077 --> 00:41:24,977
It's simmered to add flavor. 

1097
00:41:24,977 --> 00:41:26,811
- Simmered. / - Only in winter... 

1098
00:41:26,811 --> 00:41:28,477
- Organic museum? / - What? 

1099
00:41:29,411 --> 00:41:30,844
- No... / - Natural history. 

1100
00:41:30,844 --> 00:41:34,944
- Natural history? / - Not sudden death. 

1101
00:41:34,944 --> 00:41:36,277
Yeah, natural history museum. 

1102
00:41:36,277 --> 00:41:38,544
This is the natural history museum. 

1103
00:41:38,544 --> 00:41:40,977
Just like the skating rink at Seoul City Hall. 

1104
00:41:40,977 --> 00:41:42,211
It's like that here. 

1105
00:41:42,211 --> 00:41:44,644
- I love the ambience here. / - Right. 

1106
00:41:44,644 --> 00:41:48,777
I like that we can sit inside after skating. 

1107
00:41:48,777 --> 00:41:51,311
I heard they sell mulled wine only in the winter. 

1108
00:41:51,744 --> 00:41:52,777
- Really? / - Yeah. 

1109
00:41:52,777 --> 00:41:55,711
Now that I think of it, we also have things like this 

1110
00:41:55,711 --> 00:41:57,144
in Seoul and so on... 

1111
00:41:57,144 --> 00:41:58,777
But I've never tried it there. 

1112
00:41:58,777 --> 00:42:01,777
It's nice to do things that we don't do in Korea. 

1113
00:42:01,777 --> 00:42:03,811
It's been a while since I skated in an ice rink. 

1114
00:42:03,811 --> 00:42:05,911
I hear carols. 

1115
00:42:06,011 --> 00:42:08,377
This is the first time hearing carols this year. 

1116
00:42:09,344 --> 00:42:12,277
It's a shame that I had to hear it with you. 

1117
00:42:13,777 --> 00:42:14,477
- Yeah? / - Yeah. 

1118
00:42:14,477 --> 00:42:16,477
I'm really happy I heard it with you. 

1119
00:42:19,244 --> 00:42:21,511
Really? Have a drink. 

1120
00:42:22,644 --> 00:42:23,911
We'll head to Liverpool tomorrow. 

1121
00:42:23,911 --> 00:42:25,477
- For The Beatles. / - For The Beatles. 

1122
00:42:35,111 --> 00:42:38,044
(Listening to the music from 50 years ago) 

1123
00:42:38,044 --> 00:42:39,344
Their trip has just begun. 

1124
00:42:41,511 --> 00:42:46,644
(Heading off to Liverpool with The Beatles) 

1125
00:42:53,311 --> 00:42:54,877
It's fun to watch this again. 

1126
00:42:54,877 --> 00:42:56,811
We just saw the best burger ever. 

1127
00:42:56,811 --> 00:42:59,711
The donut burger looked really delicious. 

1128
00:42:59,711 --> 00:43:00,777
Please tell us how it was. 

1129
00:43:00,777 --> 00:43:03,344
Normally, "melts in your mouth" isn't used for burgers. 

1130
00:43:03,344 --> 00:43:05,077
But when I took a bite of it, 

1131
00:43:05,077 --> 00:43:09,211
the moist donut melted in my mouth. 

1132
00:43:09,211 --> 00:43:11,477
It's not just sweet but... 

1133
00:43:11,477 --> 00:43:13,477
- Sweet and salty. / - Yes. 

1134
00:43:13,477 --> 00:43:16,511
What about the giant burger? It tasted good, right? 

1135
00:43:16,511 --> 00:43:17,444
Yes, it was. 

1136
00:43:17,444 --> 00:43:19,944
They gave us a T-shirt as well. 

1137
00:43:19,944 --> 00:43:21,611
Did you take that T-shirt? 

1138
00:43:22,444 --> 00:43:25,311
- But I ate it. / - They gave us a medium. 

1139
00:43:26,777 --> 00:43:29,611
- Did you share the rest with the staff? / - Yes. 

1140
00:43:29,611 --> 00:43:31,311
Right? That's good. 

1141
00:43:31,311 --> 00:43:33,877
Do you remember Abbey Road you saw earlier? 

1142
00:43:33,877 --> 00:43:36,711
It's possible for you to watch 

1143
00:43:36,711 --> 00:43:40,611
the road live online these days. 

1144
00:43:40,611 --> 00:43:43,344
You can watch the people walking on the road 

1145
00:43:43,344 --> 00:43:45,311
in real time. 

1146
00:43:46,411 --> 00:43:48,044
- Is this live? / - Yes. 

1147
00:43:48,044 --> 00:43:49,444
That's great resolution. 

1148
00:43:49,444 --> 00:43:51,511
- It's recording live. / - It's real time? 

1149
00:43:52,611 --> 00:43:55,244
When tourists cross the road... 

1150
00:43:55,244 --> 00:43:58,377
- Cars stop for them. / - Right. To take photos. 

1151
00:43:58,377 --> 00:43:59,044
They all cross the road. 

1152
00:43:59,044 --> 00:44:01,577
They're waiting in line to take pictures there. 

1153
00:44:01,577 --> 00:44:03,311
Yes, to take photos. 

1154
00:44:03,311 --> 00:44:06,311
- You couldn't enter Abbey Road Studios? / - No. 

1155
00:44:06,311 --> 00:44:08,477
It's closed to the public. 

1156
00:44:08,477 --> 00:44:10,744
It's not so spacious inside. 

1157
00:44:10,744 --> 00:44:13,411
It's separated into several small rooms. 

1158
00:44:13,411 --> 00:44:15,411
I heard there are many sound engineers 

1159
00:44:15,411 --> 00:44:17,811
who are good with classical music. 

1160
00:44:17,811 --> 00:44:20,144
If you pay for it, can Sikyung... 

1161
00:44:20,144 --> 00:44:21,744
- Go and record? / - He can. 

1162
00:44:21,744 --> 00:44:23,777
- If you pay... / - The funny thing is... 

1163
00:44:23,777 --> 00:44:26,344
Since this place is known for as the Beatle's studio, 

1164
00:44:26,344 --> 00:44:29,244
many rock bands want to work there. 

1165
00:44:29,244 --> 00:44:30,177
Bands? 

1166
00:44:30,177 --> 00:44:32,744
And they tell them it's better to record their music 

1167
00:44:32,744 --> 00:44:34,977
somewhere else. 

1168
00:44:34,977 --> 00:44:37,311
- But despite that... / - They still come. 

1169
00:44:37,311 --> 00:44:39,777
So many insist they must record there. 

1170
00:44:39,777 --> 00:44:41,811
Since it's meaningful. 

1171
00:44:41,811 --> 00:44:44,344
That's why there are many young people 

1172
00:44:44,344 --> 00:44:45,644
who bring money to Abbey Road. 

1173
00:44:45,644 --> 00:44:47,744
There's a Korean movie called "Kundo." 

1174
00:44:47,744 --> 00:44:50,711
The soundtracks of that movie were recorded there. 

1175
00:44:50,711 --> 00:44:51,677
It was welcoming. 

1176
00:44:51,677 --> 00:44:53,511
It's time for the first half vote. 

1177
00:44:53,511 --> 00:44:56,311
London, Liverpool, JJ Tour. 

1178
00:44:56,311 --> 00:44:59,577
Will you follow their plan to England? 

1179
00:44:59,577 --> 00:45:01,211
Please vote. 

1180
00:45:02,177 --> 00:45:04,377
(JJ Tour designed a new plan for the U.K.) 

1181
00:45:04,377 --> 00:45:06,811
(What will the judges choose?) 

1182
00:45:06,811 --> 00:45:09,177
We have the result of the first half. 

1183
00:45:09,177 --> 00:45:10,244
We're not fazed. 

1184
00:45:10,977 --> 00:45:12,744
- We're confident. / - Yes. 

1185
00:45:14,811 --> 00:45:15,877
Here they are. 

1186
00:45:16,377 --> 00:45:17,744
I don't feel too good about it. 

1187
00:45:23,577 --> 00:45:24,811
Really? 

1188
00:45:24,811 --> 00:45:27,411
I can't read Gikwang's face. 

1189
00:45:28,444 --> 00:45:30,511
(They got more votes than the HighMan Tour) 

1190
00:45:30,511 --> 00:45:31,611
Something is wrong. 

1191
00:45:32,344 --> 00:45:34,677
This is shocking. 

1192
00:45:34,677 --> 00:45:36,744
They can't understand why we got so many votes. 

1193
00:45:36,744 --> 00:45:39,244
- Gikwang. / - Tell us what you think of it. 

1194
00:45:39,244 --> 00:45:41,477
- About what? The result? / - Yes. 

1195
00:45:42,277 --> 00:45:44,244
- Actually... / - We asked Gikwang. 

1196
00:45:45,211 --> 00:45:47,644
You two are liars. We don't believe you. 

1197
00:45:47,644 --> 00:45:48,611
Gikwang. 

1198
00:45:48,611 --> 00:45:49,744
He's an innocent guy. 

1199
00:45:49,744 --> 00:45:51,977
- Well, I... / - Look at us. 

1200
00:45:52,577 --> 00:45:53,811
- How was it? / - Don't look at them. 

1201
00:45:53,811 --> 00:45:54,544
You're surprised, aren't you? 

1202
00:45:54,544 --> 00:45:57,544
- The result surprised me. / - I know. 

1203
00:45:57,544 --> 00:45:59,077
So why did it surprise you? 

1204
00:45:59,077 --> 00:46:01,644
- I don't know. / - What are you thinking? 

1205
00:46:01,644 --> 00:46:02,711
I'm not sure about that. 

1206
00:46:02,711 --> 00:46:05,211
- I didn't expect this result. / - It must be high. 

1207
00:46:05,211 --> 00:46:08,044
Alright. Let's see if it's actually nice in Liverpool. 

1208
00:46:08,044 --> 00:46:10,377
- The second half is important. / - Should we go? 

1209
00:46:10,377 --> 00:46:12,477
Let's check it out with our own eyes. 

1210
00:46:12,477 --> 00:46:14,544
Looking forward to statues of The Beatles and the club. 

1211
00:46:14,544 --> 00:46:17,211
JJ Tour heads to Liverpool. Let's go. 

1212
00:46:20,277 --> 00:46:21,444
- Wow. / - Wow, this... 

1213
00:46:23,811 --> 00:46:25,877
This is nice. 

1214
00:46:25,977 --> 00:46:28,811
The Beatles. They're awesome. 

1215
00:46:28,811 --> 00:46:32,411
How about we make it a Beatles-themed tour? 

1216
00:46:32,411 --> 00:46:35,477
Everyone loves the Beatles. 

1217
00:46:35,477 --> 00:46:36,844
- Koreans love the Beatles too. / - Of course. 

1218
00:46:36,844 --> 00:46:38,977
We're not going to Liverpool for the food. 

1219
00:46:38,977 --> 00:46:41,411
We're going for The Beatles. 

1220
00:46:42,077 --> 00:46:44,444
Finally, we're meeting The Beatles. 

1221
00:46:44,444 --> 00:46:46,311
I feel emotional. 

1222
00:46:46,311 --> 00:46:47,644
The Beatles aren't in the shot. 

1223
00:46:47,644 --> 00:46:49,611
- Isn't it incredible? / - I respect them. 

1224
00:46:49,611 --> 00:46:53,177
- Must be John Lennon glasses. / - I bought them. 

1225
00:46:54,711 --> 00:46:57,144
(The Beatles Tour begins now) 

1226
00:47:02,444 --> 00:47:04,544
We're in Liverpool. 

1227
00:47:04,544 --> 00:47:07,344
The statue is donated by the owner 

1228
00:47:07,344 --> 00:47:08,544
of the club. 

1229
00:47:09,611 --> 00:47:10,711
It's really incredible. 

1230
00:47:12,011 --> 00:47:15,544
(You can find The Beatles everywhere in Liverpool) 

1231
00:47:16,744 --> 00:47:21,377
(It's their second morning in London) 

1232
00:47:22,611 --> 00:47:25,377
(London Euston Station) 

1233
00:47:26,277 --> 00:47:29,177
From now on, 

1234
00:47:29,177 --> 00:47:32,444
I'm the guide of The Beatles Tour. 

1235
00:47:32,444 --> 00:47:35,144
Your tour in London was so poorly planned 

1236
00:47:35,144 --> 00:47:37,144
that I was very frustrated during the stay in London. 

1237
00:47:37,144 --> 00:47:38,011
Really? 

1238
00:47:38,011 --> 00:47:42,677
Today we're going to ride Virgin Trains. 

1239
00:47:42,677 --> 00:47:45,744
It's like KTX in Korea. 

1240
00:47:45,744 --> 00:47:49,711
If we take a car, it'd take about 4.5 hours. 

1241
00:47:49,711 --> 00:47:52,811
It's like the distance between Seoul and Pohang. 

1242
00:47:52,811 --> 00:47:56,811
It takes about 2 hours and 10 minutes by train. 

1243
00:47:56,811 --> 00:47:57,811
So we're going to take the train. 

1244
00:47:57,811 --> 00:48:00,144
Just like any other tickets, 

1245
00:48:00,144 --> 00:48:01,844
we can buy them in person 

1246
00:48:01,844 --> 00:48:03,611
but it's cheaper online. 

1247
00:48:04,477 --> 00:48:05,911
Listen to me. 

1248
00:48:05,911 --> 00:48:08,477
This man invented steam locomotives. 

1249
00:48:09,911 --> 00:48:12,977
It's cheaper online so I already made 

1250
00:48:12,977 --> 00:48:16,311
a reservation online. 

1251
00:48:16,311 --> 00:48:17,411
- You did a good job. / - You can't do this, right? 

1252
00:48:17,411 --> 00:48:19,344
- $31.70. / - I don't know how to use computers. 

1253
00:48:19,344 --> 00:48:22,444
It must be cheaper to reserve online. 

1254
00:48:22,444 --> 00:48:24,977
We're going to Liverpool to meet The Beatles. 

1255
00:48:24,977 --> 00:48:26,511
Nice! The Beatles. 

1256
00:48:26,511 --> 00:48:31,311
- ♪ Hey, Jude ♪ / - Nice. 

1257
00:48:31,311 --> 00:48:32,844
Keeps repeating the same thing. 

1258
00:48:32,844 --> 00:48:34,677
I like that melody. 

1259
00:48:35,211 --> 00:48:37,477
- It's the best. / - He says he likes that melody. 

1260
00:48:38,711 --> 00:48:40,977
- It departs at 11:07 a.m. / - 11:07? 

1261
00:48:46,011 --> 00:48:47,277
I see Liverpool over there. 

1262
00:48:49,677 --> 00:48:51,777
Liverpool Lime Station, preparing. 

1263
00:48:51,777 --> 00:48:53,644
They must be getting the train ready. 

1264
00:48:54,611 --> 00:48:57,744
It looks like a stock market. 

1265
00:48:57,744 --> 00:49:00,844
- Everyone is looking at the board. / - Stock exchange... 

1266
00:49:05,011 --> 00:49:07,377
- It's up. Liverpool. / - 14. 

1267
00:49:07,377 --> 00:49:09,011
You have to keep watching? 

1268
00:49:09,677 --> 00:49:11,911
The platform number pops up. 

1269
00:49:12,411 --> 00:49:13,944
Can't you wait at the platform? 

1270
00:49:13,944 --> 00:49:17,044
- But you don't know which platform. / - It doesn't say? 

1271
00:49:17,577 --> 00:49:19,711
It tells you which platform to go to. 

1272
00:49:22,344 --> 00:49:23,144
Let's go. 

1273
00:49:24,344 --> 00:49:28,511
- It departs at 11:07 and arrives at 13:19. / - It's here. 

1274
00:49:28,511 --> 00:49:30,077
Isn't that it? 

1275
00:49:30,911 --> 00:49:33,411
- It looks like KTX, doesn't it? / - It does. 

1276
00:49:33,777 --> 00:49:37,011
It'd be nice if we can meet someone in the train. 

1277
00:49:37,011 --> 00:49:38,511
- Just like in the movies. / - Makes your heart flutter. 

1278
00:49:38,511 --> 00:49:40,877
- You know what I mean. / - Like the movies... 

1279
00:49:40,877 --> 00:49:43,111
Wondering who will sit beside me. 

1280
00:49:43,811 --> 00:49:44,877
(Who else would it be?) 

1281
00:49:44,877 --> 00:49:46,444
You're traveling together. 

1282
00:49:47,011 --> 00:49:49,211
You look like you're wearing matching tops. 

1283
00:49:49,211 --> 00:49:51,511
I feel like I've seen a couple like them. 

1284
00:49:52,444 --> 00:49:54,377
We're now leaving London. 

1285
00:49:54,377 --> 00:49:58,144
There are many parks and good hiking spots here. 

1286
00:49:58,911 --> 00:50:02,444
But the sun and weather play a big part. 

1287
00:50:02,444 --> 00:50:06,777
Personally, I don't like big cities. 

1288
00:50:07,211 --> 00:50:08,844
- Same for me. / - Whatever the country... 

1289
00:50:08,844 --> 00:50:10,477
- You live in Ilsan, right? / - Yeah. 

1290
00:50:10,911 --> 00:50:14,644
- Whichever country it is, I like the outskirts. / - Yeah. 

1291
00:50:14,644 --> 00:50:16,644
Anyway, let's forget about London now... 

1292
00:50:17,744 --> 00:50:19,444
We're going to Liverpool. 

1293
00:50:20,111 --> 00:50:22,944
There are so many places to visit in Liverpool. 

1294
00:50:22,944 --> 00:50:23,577
Yeah? 

1295
00:50:24,077 --> 00:50:25,677
- It's a pilgrimage. / - Right. 

1296
00:50:25,677 --> 00:50:29,044
- As fans of The Beatles. / - Right. 

1297
00:50:29,044 --> 00:50:31,877
You two both love music. 

1298
00:50:31,877 --> 00:50:33,711
I think it's really nice that you two go on 

1299
00:50:33,711 --> 00:50:35,611
a Beatles pilgrimage. 

1300
00:50:35,611 --> 00:50:36,844
I'm hungry. 

1301
00:50:37,544 --> 00:50:38,277
Wow. 

1302
00:50:38,277 --> 00:50:41,944
We bought lunch at the train station. 

1303
00:50:41,944 --> 00:50:44,577
You must try the local packed lunch when you travel. 

1304
00:50:44,577 --> 00:50:46,144
- But eating on the train... / - The time flew by. 

1305
00:50:46,144 --> 00:50:47,244
I felt sick. 

1306
00:50:47,844 --> 00:50:49,444
Because the train was fast. 

1307
00:50:50,044 --> 00:50:51,977
You guys think totally differently. 

1308
00:50:52,911 --> 00:50:54,444
Things zoom by so fast... 

1309
00:50:54,444 --> 00:50:56,844
You should eat before you ride the KTX as well. 

1310
00:50:56,844 --> 00:51:01,644
(The Beatles pilgrimage course) 

1311
00:51:05,611 --> 00:51:07,477
We are in Liverpool. 

1312
00:51:08,477 --> 00:51:11,644
Liverpool gets its name... 

1313
00:51:11,644 --> 00:51:14,111
- From brown pool. / - So pretty. 

1314
00:51:14,111 --> 00:51:16,477
- Much nicer than Manchester. / - Yes. 

1315
00:51:16,477 --> 00:51:18,477
That's why it's Liverpool. 

1316
00:51:18,477 --> 00:51:20,844
- The water is brown. / - Really? 

1317
00:51:20,844 --> 00:51:23,377
- The city looks pretty. / - This is cool. 

1318
00:51:25,577 --> 00:51:27,611
Liverpool, so nice. 

1319
00:51:27,611 --> 00:51:30,644
It looks even more exotic than London. 

1320
00:51:30,644 --> 00:51:32,877
It has a very nice view there. 

1321
00:51:32,877 --> 00:51:34,311
There aren't many skyscrapers. 

1322
00:51:34,311 --> 00:51:36,244
Now we're in Liverpool... 

1323
00:51:36,244 --> 00:51:38,977
Let's go find The Beatles. 

1324
00:51:40,177 --> 00:51:42,111
Let's go. This way. 

1325
00:51:46,877 --> 00:51:52,211
(In 1962, a rock band made a meteoric rise) 

1326
00:51:52,211 --> 00:51:54,477
It's an American TV show from 1964, 

1327
00:51:54,477 --> 00:51:56,011
"The Ed Sullivan Show." 

1328
00:51:57,477 --> 00:51:59,877
In 1964, the Beatles go to the U.S. for the first time 

1329
00:51:59,877 --> 00:52:01,144
to be on the TV show. 

1330
00:52:01,144 --> 00:52:05,077
In the pop industry, it's the first British invasion. 

1331
00:52:06,677 --> 00:52:09,744
The Beatles were so popular then 

1332
00:52:09,744 --> 00:52:11,411
that there was a saying that anyone who has 

1333
00:52:11,411 --> 00:52:14,777
a British passport can release albums in the U.S. 

1334
00:52:14,777 --> 00:52:16,077
It was crazy. 

1335
00:52:17,844 --> 00:52:19,811
(The Beatles pilgrimage course) 

1336
00:52:19,811 --> 00:52:21,644
(The Beatles statue) 

1337
00:52:22,077 --> 00:52:25,377
(15 minute walk from Lime Street Station) 

1338
00:52:25,377 --> 00:52:27,277
Everything is nearby. 

1339
00:52:31,444 --> 00:52:34,111
(Pier Head) 

1340
00:52:34,111 --> 00:52:37,111
We're near the ocean so it's quite windy here. 

1341
00:52:39,644 --> 00:52:42,544
- I see the statue. / - The Beatles statute. 

1342
00:52:42,544 --> 00:52:44,144
The Beatles statute! 

1343
00:52:48,911 --> 00:52:50,744
This song is called "Penny Lane." 

1344
00:52:50,744 --> 00:52:52,744
It's the name of a street in Liverpool. 

1345
00:52:52,977 --> 00:52:56,144
(Paul McCartney, George Harrison) 

1346
00:52:56,811 --> 00:52:57,611
(John Lennon) 

1347
00:52:57,611 --> 00:52:59,577
Which of them are still alive? 

1348
00:52:59,577 --> 00:53:02,477
Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr are still alive. 

1349
00:53:03,377 --> 00:53:07,077
There's a club called Cavern Club which we'll visit later. 

1350
00:53:07,077 --> 00:53:09,777
That club donated these statues. 

1351
00:53:10,444 --> 00:53:12,477
It shows their love for The Beatles. 

1352
00:53:12,477 --> 00:53:13,577
So cool. 

1353
00:53:13,577 --> 00:53:14,677
The statues match well with the cityscape. 

1354
00:53:14,677 --> 00:53:17,177
They're in the middle of the street. 

1355
00:53:20,877 --> 00:53:22,844
Finally, we meet The Beatles. 

1356
00:53:22,844 --> 00:53:25,144
- We should take pictures. / - We're meeting them. 

1357
00:53:25,811 --> 00:53:28,477
- I bet many people take pictures here. / - Yeah. 

1358
00:53:28,477 --> 00:53:30,444
(They look somewhat awkward) 

1359
00:53:30,444 --> 00:53:32,044
- We can't see The Beatles. / - We can't see them. 

1360
00:53:32,044 --> 00:53:34,511
We're blocking them. 

1361
00:53:34,511 --> 00:53:36,044
I don't think it'll work even if you had really long arms. 

1362
00:53:36,044 --> 00:53:37,411
It was really hard. 

1363
00:53:37,411 --> 00:53:40,411
- The statues were bigger than we thought. / - Right. 

1364
00:53:41,377 --> 00:53:42,611
We're still blocking them. 

1365
00:53:43,011 --> 00:53:44,711
We need The Beatles in our pictures. 

1366
00:53:45,811 --> 00:53:49,044
- Let's take pictures separately. / - Separately? 

1367
00:53:49,044 --> 00:53:50,977
Life is live together, die alone. 

1368
00:53:52,577 --> 00:53:55,877
- You're alone. / - It means you're alone. 

1369
00:53:55,877 --> 00:53:56,877
Alone... 

1370
00:53:56,877 --> 00:54:00,511
(Strict individualism, separate but together) 

1371
00:54:01,444 --> 00:54:02,677
The Beatles. 

1372
00:54:03,511 --> 00:54:05,611
I feel emotional. 

1373
00:54:07,577 --> 00:54:11,011
(He seems happy to see the statues) 

1374
00:54:11,811 --> 00:54:13,611
So cool. 

1375
00:54:15,744 --> 00:54:18,977
The rides only operate during the winter. 

1376
00:54:18,977 --> 00:54:20,444
The Beatles Story. 

1377
00:54:20,444 --> 00:54:22,377
This is the museum I talked about. 

1378
00:54:23,144 --> 00:54:26,044
We're going to The Beatles museum. 

1379
00:54:27,744 --> 00:54:29,377
- We're here. / - Is this the place? 

1380
00:54:29,377 --> 00:54:32,277
The Beatles Story. 

1381
00:54:33,244 --> 00:54:34,811
- It's a museum. / - Let's go meet them. 

1382
00:54:34,811 --> 00:54:36,444
The whole city lives off The Beatles. 

1383
00:54:41,544 --> 00:54:42,644
It's so nice. 

1384
00:54:42,644 --> 00:54:45,644
I couldn't help but feel awe in there. 

1385
00:54:49,111 --> 00:54:51,644
- John Lennon. / - His actual glasses? 

1386
00:54:52,544 --> 00:54:54,477
(Everything that The Beatles touched) 

1387
00:54:54,611 --> 00:54:57,044
(Let's look into their glorious history) 

1388
00:54:57,377 --> 00:54:58,911
The Beatles museum. 

1389
00:55:00,411 --> 00:55:03,077
This is the time... The 1940s. 

1390
00:55:03,544 --> 00:55:05,577
It must play music. 

1391
00:55:05,577 --> 00:55:06,711
Start. 

1392
00:55:06,711 --> 00:55:09,244
(He pressed the start button) 

1393
00:55:09,244 --> 00:55:13,411
(But he can't understand anything) 

1394
00:55:13,744 --> 00:55:15,011
There's no Korean translation. 

1395
00:55:15,944 --> 00:55:17,377
I can't hear anything. 

1396
00:55:17,377 --> 00:55:19,411
Do you remember the thing we saw earlier? 

1397
00:55:19,411 --> 00:55:20,811
Look. It's over there. 

1398
00:55:21,511 --> 00:55:23,744
It must play audio 

1399
00:55:23,744 --> 00:55:25,844
if you walk around with it. 

1400
00:55:25,844 --> 00:55:27,211
Is it? 

1401
00:55:27,211 --> 00:55:29,211
It translates to your language. 

1402
00:55:29,211 --> 00:55:30,911
But there was no Korean translation anyway. 

1403
00:55:31,344 --> 00:55:32,944
We can't use it anyway. 

1404
00:55:35,544 --> 00:55:36,744
Wow. 

1405
00:55:38,577 --> 00:55:40,111
They were really young then. 

1406
00:55:40,111 --> 00:55:41,511
Ringo Starr. 

1407
00:55:41,977 --> 00:55:42,944
George Harrison. 

1408
00:55:42,944 --> 00:55:45,711
- John Lennon. / - Paul McCartney. 

1409
00:55:46,111 --> 00:55:48,811
- When I saw the picture... / - Feels strange, right? 

1410
00:55:48,811 --> 00:55:50,777
I felt emotional. 

1411
00:55:51,211 --> 00:55:54,211
- This must be Port of Liverpool, right? / - Yeah. 

1412
00:55:54,977 --> 00:55:58,311
(It's a picture of The Beatles at Port of Liverpool) 

1413
00:56:00,444 --> 00:56:03,611
The Beatles were from the working class 

1414
00:56:03,611 --> 00:56:06,911
so they weren't very well dressed. 

1415
00:56:06,911 --> 00:56:09,777
Then their manager, Brian Epstein 

1416
00:56:09,777 --> 00:56:12,277
dressed them up in nice suits. 

1417
00:56:12,277 --> 00:56:14,811
That's when they gained popularity with the girls. 

1418
00:56:15,577 --> 00:56:17,711
- They're fainting. / - Lots of fans fainting. 

1419
00:56:19,344 --> 00:56:20,444
Look. 

1420
00:56:20,844 --> 00:56:23,711
They actually fainted from heart attacks back then. 

1421
00:56:25,611 --> 00:56:27,577
Abbey Road Studios. 

1422
00:56:27,677 --> 00:56:31,844
(They went to Abbey Road in London) 

1423
00:56:32,211 --> 00:56:34,211
We saw this in London. 

1424
00:56:34,211 --> 00:56:37,244
It's the Abbey Road Studios we couldn't enter. 

1425
00:56:37,244 --> 00:56:39,144
The studio is recreated here. 

1426
00:56:39,144 --> 00:56:41,477
- The inside of the studio? / - Yes. 

1427
00:56:41,477 --> 00:56:42,777
Back in those days. 

1428
00:56:43,611 --> 00:56:45,911
The way they recorded in there. 

1429
00:56:46,477 --> 00:56:48,011
They're really great singers. 

1430
00:56:48,011 --> 00:56:50,011
Recording like that... 

1431
00:56:51,311 --> 00:56:52,811
This is the recording studio. 

1432
00:56:52,811 --> 00:56:54,511
Let's go down. 

1433
00:56:54,744 --> 00:56:56,077
It's small, right? 

1434
00:56:56,077 --> 00:56:57,177
That's where they recorded music. 

1435
00:56:57,177 --> 00:56:58,911
It's really small. 

1436
00:56:58,911 --> 00:56:59,977
They must have been like, 

1437
00:56:59,977 --> 00:57:01,444
"That was an excellent job!" 

1438
00:57:05,011 --> 00:57:06,544
(Sparkle) 

1439
00:57:06,711 --> 00:57:08,511
- Mathew Street. / - The Beatles street. 

1440
00:57:08,511 --> 00:57:10,544
This is the recreation of the street. 

1441
00:57:11,677 --> 00:57:14,044
This is where we will visit later. 

1442
00:57:15,411 --> 00:57:16,877
So this is the street. 

1443
00:57:17,344 --> 00:57:17,944
Cavern. 

1444
00:57:18,611 --> 00:57:20,444
- This must be Cavern Club. / - It looks like it. 

1445
00:57:20,444 --> 00:57:21,511
This is where they held their first concert. 

1446
00:57:21,511 --> 00:57:23,144
It's Cavern Club. 

1447
00:57:23,144 --> 00:57:25,411
So this is how it looks. 

1448
00:57:32,144 --> 00:57:34,211
It was smaller than we imagined. 

1449
00:57:34,211 --> 00:57:36,144
Four people can't stand in a line there 

1450
00:57:36,144 --> 00:57:37,811
because it's too narrow. 

1451
00:57:37,811 --> 00:57:39,611
After the Beatles debuted, 

1452
00:57:39,611 --> 00:57:41,844
the queue to the club became so long... 

1453
00:57:41,844 --> 00:57:44,144
Since then, the number of girls who went to 

1454
00:57:44,144 --> 00:57:46,211
record shops and asked for 

1455
00:57:46,211 --> 00:57:47,944
The Beatles album grew. 

1456
00:57:47,944 --> 00:57:49,977
So the owner of the album store wanted to know 

1457
00:57:49,977 --> 00:57:51,511
who The Beatles were. 

1458
00:57:51,511 --> 00:57:53,244
Why are they so sought after? 

1459
00:57:53,244 --> 00:57:55,711
He went to Cavern Club, saw The Beatles 

1460
00:57:55,711 --> 00:57:56,677
and signed a contract. 

1461
00:57:56,677 --> 00:58:00,011
That was the manager of The Beatles, Brian Epstein. 

1462
00:58:00,011 --> 00:58:01,577
He must've made so much money. 

1463
00:58:01,577 --> 00:58:03,877
This place makes you feel a sense of respect. 

1464
00:58:03,877 --> 00:58:05,944
- It makes you humble, right? / - It does. 

1465
00:58:06,411 --> 00:58:09,111
(They somehow feel emotional) 

1466
00:58:09,677 --> 00:58:11,744
This was The Beatles' private jet. Let's take a seat. 

1467
00:58:11,744 --> 00:58:14,077
It's the recreation of The Beatles' private jet. 

1468
00:58:15,777 --> 00:58:17,511
So this was The Beatles' private jet? 

1469
00:58:19,911 --> 00:58:21,911
This is bizarre. 

1470
00:58:21,911 --> 00:58:23,611
"Life vest under your seat" is written in Korean. 

1471
00:58:23,611 --> 00:58:25,077
- What is that? / - So random? 

1472
00:58:25,077 --> 00:58:26,577
- What the? / - Huh? 

1473
00:58:26,577 --> 00:58:27,511
What's going on? 

1474
00:58:27,511 --> 00:58:30,211
- Was it a Korean plane? / - The private jet? 

1475
00:58:30,211 --> 00:58:31,844
- That looks strange. / - Isn't it strange? 

1476
00:58:31,844 --> 00:58:33,977
- It's strange. / - It was really funny. 

1477
00:58:34,511 --> 00:58:36,344
It's written in Korean? 

1478
00:58:36,344 --> 00:58:39,344
- What's going on? / - It must've been a Korean jet. 

1479
00:58:39,544 --> 00:58:40,244
What is this? 

1480
00:58:40,244 --> 00:58:42,844
They must've taken those seats from an old Korean jet. 

1481
00:58:43,477 --> 00:58:46,744
- Is it under the seat? / - Is this really their private jet? 

1482
00:58:48,077 --> 00:58:50,477
(Doubt it) 

1483
00:58:50,944 --> 00:58:54,277
- There's so much to see at the museum. / - There is. 

1484
00:58:54,277 --> 00:58:56,244
Fans of The Beatles must visit there. 

1485
00:58:57,311 --> 00:59:02,177
(14 minutes to Mathew Street from Beatles museum) 

1486
00:59:02,177 --> 00:59:04,511
Here we are. Mathew Street. 

1487
00:59:04,877 --> 00:59:06,411
This is Mathew Street. 

1488
00:59:06,411 --> 00:59:08,044
This is it. 

1489
00:59:08,044 --> 00:59:10,411
- The street we saw in the museum. / - Right. 

1490
00:59:11,777 --> 00:59:15,311
Since this is the street of The Beatles, 

1491
00:59:15,311 --> 00:59:19,044
all the shops here have pictures of The Beatles. 

1492
00:59:20,011 --> 00:59:23,344
- This is my kind of street. / - It's nice. 

1493
00:59:25,344 --> 00:59:27,311
John Lennon's bar. 

1494
00:59:27,644 --> 00:59:29,844
- John Lennon's bar. / - What is that? 

1495
00:59:31,044 --> 00:59:32,144
Look here. 

1496
00:59:32,144 --> 00:59:35,511
John Lennon worked as a part-timer here. 

1497
00:59:35,511 --> 00:59:37,311
Really? He worked part-time here? 

1498
00:59:39,811 --> 00:59:40,844
How nice. 

1499
00:59:41,344 --> 00:59:42,611
And this is... 

1500
00:59:43,944 --> 00:59:48,211
(Music plays endlessly in the street) 

1501
00:59:48,677 --> 00:59:52,044
(There's a statue next to him) 

1502
00:59:52,044 --> 00:59:52,911
This is... 

1503
00:59:53,377 --> 00:59:56,277
That's what's on John Lennon's famous solo album. 

1504
00:59:56,277 --> 00:59:57,477
- It's his pose. / - The statue. 

1505
00:59:58,511 --> 01:00:00,711
(Polite) 

1506
01:00:01,577 --> 01:00:03,544
Jonghyuk, your head is smaller than his. 

1507
01:00:05,177 --> 01:00:07,711
(He poses like John Lennon) 

1508
01:00:07,977 --> 01:00:11,244
(Meeting John Lennon again, my head is smaller) 

1509
01:00:11,244 --> 01:00:12,111
Please take one for me too. 

1510
01:00:12,277 --> 01:00:15,711
(Hyungjun takes a picture with the statue as well) 

1511
01:00:15,711 --> 01:00:16,711
You look better in the picture. 

1512
01:00:17,977 --> 01:00:19,211
Did you try to take a good picture? 

1513
01:00:19,211 --> 01:00:20,611
- Are you sure you tried to take a good one? / - Yeah! 

1514
01:00:21,277 --> 01:00:23,111
- Is it weird? / - It looks half hearted. 

1515
01:00:23,111 --> 01:00:24,677
Stand there. I'll take it again. 

1516
01:00:24,677 --> 01:00:26,077
Stand there again... 

1517
01:00:26,477 --> 01:00:28,877
(He ends up taking a selfie with the statue) 

1518
01:00:29,211 --> 01:00:31,277
(Selfie is the best) 

1519
01:00:32,877 --> 01:00:35,311
(It seems they found something) 

1520
01:00:35,311 --> 01:00:35,611
Is there something there? 

1521
01:00:35,611 --> 01:00:39,011
It's the hall of fame of people... 

1522
01:00:39,011 --> 01:00:41,677
- That performed here on the bricks. / - Their names? 

1523
01:00:42,244 --> 01:00:44,711
Amazing top stars were there. 

1524
01:00:44,711 --> 01:00:47,277
There is Michael Jackson and other stars. 

1525
01:00:47,277 --> 01:00:49,211
It's all amazing artists. 

1526
01:00:49,211 --> 01:00:52,377
(JJ Tour is desperately looking for a name) 

1527
01:00:52,377 --> 01:00:55,411
- The Beatles. / - The Beatle. 

1528
01:00:55,411 --> 01:00:57,244
I see Rolling Stones too. 

1529
01:00:57,244 --> 01:00:59,011
This is incredible. 

1530
01:01:00,244 --> 01:01:01,911
- A historic site. / - It's amazing. 

1531
01:01:01,911 --> 01:01:03,977
I'll have to go there. 

1532
01:01:03,977 --> 01:01:06,411
- Is this the Cavern Club? / - Cavern Club. 

1533
01:01:06,411 --> 01:01:09,477
The Beatles performed here... 

1534
01:01:09,477 --> 01:01:13,044
For the first time as the Fab Four. 

1535
01:01:14,177 --> 01:01:16,811
(They're at a Beatles shrine) 

1536
01:01:16,811 --> 01:01:19,211
- Didn't you see this at the museum? / - Yes. 

1537
01:01:19,211 --> 01:01:21,644
- Actual club. / - The real club now. 

1538
01:01:23,744 --> 01:01:25,144
- Jonghyuk! / - Yeah. 

1539
01:01:25,144 --> 01:01:28,044
This is the highlight of our tour. 

1540
01:01:29,111 --> 01:01:31,277
We're at the Cavern Club. 

1541
01:01:31,277 --> 01:01:33,877
We came to Liverpool to see this. 

1542
01:01:33,877 --> 01:01:35,377
That's not an overstatement. 

1543
01:01:35,377 --> 01:01:37,444
The Beatles performed for the very first time here. 

1544
01:01:37,911 --> 01:01:39,077
Let's go. 

1545
01:01:39,777 --> 01:01:42,044
Someone must be performing here. 

1546
01:01:42,044 --> 01:01:43,177
- Performing live. / - That's right. 

1547
01:01:43,177 --> 01:01:45,177
The atmosphere was so great when we went inside. 

1548
01:01:51,544 --> 01:01:55,577
(This is the sacred place of the Beatles) 

1549
01:01:59,511 --> 01:02:02,277
(The music of the Beatles is always on) 

1550
01:02:02,277 --> 01:02:04,277
It's not a place for young people. 

1551
01:02:04,277 --> 01:02:05,644
It's mainly for tourists and 

1552
01:02:05,644 --> 01:02:09,477
high school alumni of The Beatles. 

1553
01:02:10,977 --> 01:02:14,644
(The Beatles performed here for the first time) 

1554
01:02:14,644 --> 01:02:17,277
I'm surprised that they have footage of this. 

1555
01:02:17,277 --> 01:02:19,444
This would be 1961. 

1556
01:02:20,511 --> 01:02:22,511
Their first show cost 5 pounds 

1557
01:02:22,511 --> 01:02:24,744
but their final one cost 300. 

1558
01:02:24,744 --> 01:02:25,811
That's impressive. 

1559
01:02:25,811 --> 01:02:28,377
Everything you see is a museum. 

1560
01:02:28,377 --> 01:02:30,611
I loved their beer there. 

1561
01:02:32,444 --> 01:02:33,811
This is nice. 

1562
01:02:35,111 --> 01:02:37,711
(Fascinated) 

1563
01:02:38,577 --> 01:02:40,811
(Looking around) 

1564
01:02:40,811 --> 01:02:42,277
It's similar. 

1565
01:02:42,544 --> 01:02:45,144
- Similar to the museum, right? / - Yeah. 

1566
01:02:45,944 --> 01:02:47,211
(Beatles museum) 

1567
01:02:47,211 --> 01:02:48,944
(Cavern Club) 

1568
01:02:48,944 --> 01:02:50,077
It's the same. 

1569
01:02:50,777 --> 01:02:52,544
They built it the same. 

1570
01:02:56,277 --> 01:02:59,311
Countless singers wanted to perform here. 

1571
01:02:59,311 --> 01:03:02,444
Adele performed here in 2011. 

1572
01:03:02,444 --> 01:03:03,444
- Really? / - Yeah. 

1573
01:03:04,311 --> 01:03:06,311
Is there an entrance fee or is it free? 

1574
01:03:06,311 --> 01:03:08,511
- There's an entrance fee. / - It's $5.80 per person. 

1575
01:03:08,511 --> 01:03:10,211
It's not that expensive. 

1576
01:03:10,211 --> 01:03:11,911
It must have positive energy. 

1577
01:03:11,911 --> 01:03:13,577
It must be a live performance. 

1578
01:03:15,411 --> 01:03:18,844
(What are they doing?) 

1579
01:03:21,677 --> 01:03:23,611
(Familiar hairstyles are entering the stage one by one) 

1580
01:03:23,611 --> 01:03:25,811
They wore wigs and entered the stage. 

1581
01:03:25,811 --> 01:03:27,311
I didn't know at first. 

1582
01:03:27,311 --> 01:03:29,477
They're a Beatles tribute band. 

1583
01:03:29,477 --> 01:03:31,344
Their voices were so similar. 

1584
01:03:36,577 --> 01:03:38,544
(Beatles tribute band) 

1585
01:03:38,544 --> 01:03:40,277
- They seem similar. / - Yes. 

1586
01:03:40,977 --> 01:03:42,777
They are. 

1587
01:03:46,877 --> 01:03:49,111
Everyone is holding up their phones in the front. 

1588
01:03:49,544 --> 01:03:51,811
(Big smile) 

1589
01:03:51,811 --> 01:03:53,411
They're really like The Beatles. 

1590
01:03:54,477 --> 01:03:56,511
(Approves) 

1591
01:04:00,144 --> 01:04:02,744
(Bounce) 

1592
01:04:02,744 --> 01:04:05,744
(Tapping to the rhythm) 

1593
01:04:06,377 --> 01:04:10,911
(Even lazy Jonghyuk does his best to record them) 

1594
01:04:13,977 --> 01:04:18,211
(The reaction of the performance was amazing) 

1595
01:04:18,211 --> 01:04:20,444
(Bravo) 

1596
01:04:20,444 --> 01:04:22,911
Does that band perform every day? 

1597
01:04:22,911 --> 01:04:24,677
They also have a schedule. 

1598
01:04:24,677 --> 01:04:26,877
You can see their schedule on... 

1599
01:04:26,877 --> 01:04:30,444
- The Cavern Club website. / - They have their schedule. 

1600
01:04:31,411 --> 01:04:37,111
(Even if time passed by, the emotions are the same) 

1601
01:04:37,111 --> 01:04:45,377
(The emotional voices fill the club completely) 

1602
01:04:47,211 --> 01:04:50,244
(The atmosphere is great) 

1603
01:04:52,711 --> 01:04:55,677
He's feeling better after a beer. 

1604
01:04:55,677 --> 01:04:57,311
(It's really heating up) 

1605
01:04:57,311 --> 01:04:59,311
- It'd be so nice there with a beer. / - Ireland. 

1606
01:04:59,311 --> 01:05:02,044
Ireland, Wales, asking where people are from... 

1607
01:05:02,044 --> 01:05:03,944
- Where they're from. / - What about Korea? 

1608
01:05:06,111 --> 01:05:07,777
Korea! 

1609
01:05:08,611 --> 01:05:09,944
Korea! Korea! 

1610
01:05:10,644 --> 01:05:13,411
- They didn't say Korea. / - Italy. 

1611
01:05:14,544 --> 01:05:19,177
- North Korea! / - Korea. 

1612
01:05:19,177 --> 01:05:22,844
- North Korea? / - You're from the north? 

1613
01:05:22,844 --> 01:05:24,277
We were too pumped up. 

1614
01:05:25,444 --> 01:05:30,411
- North Korea? / - Yeah, Korea! 

1615
01:05:30,411 --> 01:05:33,477
- North Korea! / - Not us? 

1616
01:05:33,477 --> 01:05:34,611
He's saying it's not us. 

1617
01:05:36,744 --> 01:05:39,944
- They were joking, right? / - Of course. 

1618
01:05:39,944 --> 01:05:43,277
I was wondering why they were staring. 

1619
01:06:01,644 --> 01:06:04,144
- We wanted to stay there longer. / - Lots of people. 

1620
01:06:04,144 --> 01:06:06,611
You could drink there all night long. 

1621
01:06:06,611 --> 01:06:08,477
- It's a good memory for you. / - In front of the club... 

1622
01:06:08,477 --> 01:06:10,344
There's a very famous line. 

1623
01:06:10,344 --> 01:06:11,777
What it says is... 

1624
01:06:11,777 --> 01:06:15,277
"Four lads who shook the world." 

1625
01:06:15,277 --> 01:06:17,811
Four youths that shook the world. 

1626
01:06:17,811 --> 01:06:20,011
- It's really famous. / - That's right. 

1627
01:06:20,111 --> 01:06:25,511
(They walked 14 minutes to go to the beer brewery) 

1628
01:06:26,677 --> 01:06:28,044
- The performance was amazing. / - Wasn't it? 

1629
01:06:28,044 --> 01:06:32,144
That club must be really famous. 

1630
01:06:32,144 --> 01:06:34,677
People from all around the world were there. 

1631
01:06:34,677 --> 01:06:40,244
We've seen all of Liverpool if we've seen Cavern Club. 

1632
01:06:40,244 --> 01:06:44,311
As you can see, they make their own beer here. 

1633
01:06:44,311 --> 01:06:45,811
I'm drinking beer tonight. 

1634
01:06:45,811 --> 01:06:47,044
That's all beer, right? 

1635
01:06:47,044 --> 01:06:48,044
No one would know about that place. 

1636
01:06:48,044 --> 01:06:50,377
I love it when beer comes out of the wall like that. 

1637
01:06:51,377 --> 01:06:53,211
(It's not a faucet) 

1638
01:06:53,211 --> 01:06:56,077
That seems fun to choose. 

1639
01:06:56,677 --> 01:06:58,111
It felt nice because there was so much beer. 

1640
01:06:58,111 --> 01:07:00,811
They kept updating it. 

1641
01:07:07,011 --> 01:07:08,044
Continuously. 

1642
01:07:08,044 --> 01:07:10,011
- A new beer each week. / - Wow, 12 different beers. 

1643
01:07:10,011 --> 01:07:12,277
- You can taste them. / - Pale ale. 

1644
01:07:12,911 --> 01:07:15,311
(You can try what you want) 

1645
01:07:15,311 --> 01:07:17,444
Even if you taste all this, 

1646
01:07:17,444 --> 01:07:19,044
it'd be like drinking two bottles. 

1647
01:07:20,377 --> 01:07:21,711
Let's also try that one. 

1648
01:07:23,311 --> 01:07:28,677
(They drink and drink) 

1649
01:07:28,677 --> 01:07:31,877
Jonghyuk tasted so many of them. 

1650
01:07:33,844 --> 01:07:36,244
I think he'll collapse after the tasting. 

1651
01:07:37,011 --> 01:07:38,477
I wanted to try all of them. 

1652
01:07:40,777 --> 01:07:42,177
Snacks. 

1653
01:07:42,611 --> 01:07:43,977
The snacks are perfect. 

1654
01:07:44,377 --> 01:07:46,711
So many variety of cheese. 

1655
01:07:47,511 --> 01:07:49,544
They're all cheese. 

1656
01:07:49,544 --> 01:07:52,077
- All cheese? / - They're all cheese? 

1657
01:07:52,077 --> 01:07:55,111
- Please laugh for him. / - You'll get it eventually. 

1658
01:07:55,111 --> 01:07:56,577
Right. 

1659
01:07:57,077 --> 01:07:58,111
They're all cheese. 

1660
01:07:58,777 --> 01:08:01,277
- That looks so good. / - It was good. 

1661
01:08:01,277 --> 01:08:02,944
(Rooibos red ale, Peanut milk stout) 

1662
01:08:02,944 --> 01:08:04,444
That looks delicious. 

1663
01:08:05,577 --> 01:08:06,877
Cheers. 

1664
01:08:09,177 --> 01:08:12,777
(Savoring) 

1665
01:08:13,877 --> 01:08:15,577
The taste is unique. 

1666
01:08:15,577 --> 01:08:18,744
It's my first time having dark beer. 

1667
01:08:18,744 --> 01:08:21,377
It doesn't look delicious visually. 

1668
01:08:21,377 --> 01:08:23,344
- Really? / - But it tastes really delicious. 

1669
01:08:23,344 --> 01:08:24,211
It's unique. 

1670
01:08:24,211 --> 01:08:27,477
The best way to describe it is that it's rich. 

1671
01:08:28,144 --> 01:08:32,077
- Try other ones. / - Okay. 

1672
01:08:32,077 --> 01:08:33,744
I was going to have a barrel of that. 

1673
01:08:34,311 --> 01:08:36,011
But it's not ready yet. 

1674
01:08:36,011 --> 01:08:38,077
Hi, long time no see. 

1675
01:08:38,744 --> 01:08:40,144
Long time no see? 

1676
01:08:40,144 --> 01:08:41,644
What did you have before? 

1677
01:08:41,644 --> 01:08:44,044
Tropical imperial stout. 

1678
01:08:44,044 --> 01:08:46,044
That looks strong. 

1679
01:08:47,344 --> 01:08:48,711
Thank you. 

1680
01:08:51,144 --> 01:08:54,611
(Drinking on the way to save time) 

1681
01:08:56,577 --> 01:08:58,477
It's really good. 

1682
01:08:58,477 --> 01:09:00,577
It's really good. I made a good choice. 

1683
01:09:00,577 --> 01:09:02,777
- Is it different from mine? / - Yes, it's different. 

1684
01:09:03,544 --> 01:09:05,111
Try it. 

1685
01:09:05,111 --> 01:09:06,844
I brought dark beer. Try it. 

1686
01:09:09,211 --> 01:09:11,277
- This is also different. / - Right? 

1687
01:09:11,277 --> 01:09:13,377
- This is tropical. It's fruity. / - I want some. 

1688
01:09:13,377 --> 01:09:15,011
I really mean it. 

1689
01:09:16,044 --> 01:09:18,211
This has a heavy taste and this is lighter. 

1690
01:09:18,211 --> 01:09:19,744
- Is it? / - The flavor. 

1691
01:09:19,744 --> 01:09:21,777
This one's really good. 

1692
01:09:22,744 --> 01:09:25,177
I couldn't tell from the dark color. 

1693
01:09:25,177 --> 01:09:28,111
It's dark beer but it's tropical. 

1694
01:09:28,111 --> 01:09:30,244
It's different from my last one. 

1695
01:09:30,244 --> 01:09:32,177
- How is it all different? / - This is heavy. 

1696
01:09:32,177 --> 01:09:34,177
They're all dark beer but different. 

1697
01:09:34,177 --> 01:09:39,011
Guess which is your beer. 

1698
01:09:40,511 --> 01:09:41,977
Give it here. 

1699
01:09:41,977 --> 01:09:44,011
- Which one's mine? / - In case they don't believe us. 

1700
01:09:44,011 --> 01:09:46,411
- Are the colors different? / - They're the same. 

1701
01:09:46,411 --> 01:09:48,144
- Close your eyes. / - You're not mixing them, right? 

1702
01:09:48,144 --> 01:09:49,611
Okay. 

1703
01:09:51,211 --> 01:09:53,844
(Ta-da) 

1704
01:09:53,844 --> 01:09:55,677
I really can't tell. 

1705
01:09:55,677 --> 01:09:57,677
They're even the same in amount. 

1706
01:09:57,677 --> 01:09:59,977
- Taste them and guess the beer. / - Really? 

1707
01:09:59,977 --> 01:10:02,044
- Try finding yours. / - Will he find it? 

1708
01:10:02,044 --> 01:10:03,544
He'll know when he tastes it. 

1709
01:10:04,344 --> 01:10:06,411
(Jonghyuk, Hyungjun) 

1710
01:10:06,411 --> 01:10:07,077
(Jonghyuk) 

1711
01:10:07,077 --> 01:10:09,411
(He chooses his beer confidently) 

1712
01:10:12,511 --> 01:10:13,611
Wait a minute. 

1713
01:10:16,011 --> 01:10:18,144
- Why are you gargling with it? / - Try this one. 

1714
01:10:18,944 --> 01:10:22,544
(He tries the other beer) 

1715
01:10:23,877 --> 01:10:27,444
(Will Jonghyuk be able to differentiate the beer?) 

1716
01:10:28,344 --> 01:10:30,977
(What do you think? Do you see the difference?) 

1717
01:10:30,977 --> 01:10:32,744
He said his tastes good. 

1718
01:10:33,711 --> 01:10:35,711
Can I try it again after rinsing my mouth? 

1719
01:10:38,877 --> 01:10:40,111
He's a bit tipsy. 

1720
01:10:40,111 --> 01:10:43,477
Don't rinse with more beer. 

1721
01:10:44,044 --> 01:10:46,377
You said you thought yours was tropical. 

1722
01:10:47,311 --> 01:10:49,111
(Hyungjun, Jonghyuk) 

1723
01:10:49,111 --> 01:10:51,677
This one's yours. This is the tropical. 

1724
01:10:51,677 --> 01:10:53,677
- He got it right. / - Right? 

1725
01:10:53,677 --> 01:10:55,511
- You're a beer expert. / - Of course. 

1726
01:10:59,544 --> 01:11:02,111
Our U.K. trip... 

1727
01:11:02,111 --> 01:11:05,711
It was short but we spent the time really well. 

1728
01:11:05,711 --> 01:11:09,511
People only think about London in the U.K. 

1729
01:11:10,044 --> 01:11:13,544
A trip to Liverpool could sound different. 

1730
01:11:13,544 --> 01:11:15,911
We met The Beatles here. 

1731
01:11:15,911 --> 01:11:19,977
It felt like The Beatles were alive again. 

1732
01:11:19,977 --> 01:11:21,477
And we watched their performance. 

1733
01:11:21,477 --> 01:11:24,477
We even went to the Cavern Club. 

1734
01:11:24,477 --> 01:11:27,477
I could see what it felt like when they performed. 

1735
01:11:27,477 --> 01:11:31,077
I'm glad we came to Liverpool to see that. 

1736
01:11:31,077 --> 01:11:35,244
It's an important place just with The Beatles. 

1737
01:11:35,777 --> 01:11:40,777
And this trip... We were on the MK Tour 

1738
01:11:40,777 --> 01:11:42,144
and now the JJ Tour. 

1739
01:11:42,144 --> 01:11:44,344
I can see how good Minkyo was. 

1740
01:11:44,344 --> 01:11:48,077
I realized that he prepared a lot for our trip. 

1741
01:11:48,077 --> 01:11:51,611
Nevertheless, I don't think he would've 

1742
01:11:51,611 --> 01:11:53,711
been a big help even if he was here. 

1743
01:11:54,211 --> 01:11:56,877
There's nothing Minkyo can do here. 

1744
01:11:56,877 --> 01:11:58,277
I feel bad for Minkyo though. 

1745
01:11:58,277 --> 01:12:00,777
So I told him I was sorry we came without him 

1746
01:12:00,777 --> 01:12:02,311
but he said he likes Thailand. 

1747
01:12:02,311 --> 01:12:03,811
I talked to him on the phone. 

1748
01:12:03,811 --> 01:12:05,411
He doesn't like the cold. 

1749
01:12:06,744 --> 01:12:08,877
It's not so cold here. 

1750
01:12:08,877 --> 01:12:10,911
Let's bring him on the next JJ Tour. 

1751
01:12:10,911 --> 01:12:13,711
Since you're close, you must've missed Minkyo. 

1752
01:12:15,277 --> 01:12:17,544
- Tomorrow... / - JJ Tour. 

1753
01:12:17,544 --> 01:12:19,577
We had a good time in London thanks to you. 

1754
01:12:19,577 --> 01:12:21,111
I enjoyed our trip in Liverpool. 

1755
01:12:26,044 --> 01:12:29,611
I must admit the second half was great. 

1756
01:12:29,611 --> 01:12:33,211
Do you have to pay to get into The Beatles museum? 

1757
01:12:33,211 --> 01:12:36,711
It was a little over $20. 

1758
01:12:36,711 --> 01:12:39,311
- But it's worth the money. / - It is? 

1759
01:12:39,311 --> 01:12:40,811
What's the name of the town? 

1760
01:12:40,811 --> 01:12:43,144
The museum is in Albert Dock. 

1761
01:12:43,144 --> 01:12:44,644
There's a port there. 

1762
01:12:44,644 --> 01:12:46,144
You know the movie, "Titanic." 

1763
01:12:46,144 --> 01:12:49,644
It's the port where the Titanic departed from. 

1764
01:12:49,644 --> 01:12:50,944
- Really? / - Yes. 

1765
01:12:50,944 --> 01:12:55,511
There are big shopping malls around the port. 

1766
01:12:55,511 --> 01:12:57,877
Things to buy and cafes to visit. 

1767
01:12:57,877 --> 01:13:00,244
Even if you don't go into the museum... 

1768
01:13:00,244 --> 01:13:03,477
- There's lots to see. / - Of course. So much. 

1769
01:13:03,477 --> 01:13:05,577
It sounds nice. We should talk about the expenses. 

1770
01:13:05,577 --> 01:13:06,644
Oh, the expenses. 

1771
01:13:06,644 --> 01:13:09,777
Ours was really affordable. We didn't watch soccer. 

1772
01:13:11,777 --> 01:13:13,011
Right. 

1773
01:13:13,011 --> 01:13:17,144
How much did JJ Tour spend in Liverpool? 

1774
01:13:17,811 --> 01:13:19,944
The whole trip, per person... 

1775
01:13:19,944 --> 01:13:21,744
- Per person. / - Excluding the airline tickets. 

1776
01:13:21,744 --> 01:13:23,211
You have to include the whole cost. 

1777
01:13:24,244 --> 01:13:25,977
$500.30. 

1778
01:13:26,777 --> 01:13:28,077
30 cents. 

1779
01:13:29,744 --> 01:13:33,844
Because of the cost of the Manchester match. 

1780
01:13:33,844 --> 01:13:35,911
That's the difference. 

1781
01:13:35,911 --> 01:13:37,044
- Gikwang. / - Yes? 

1782
01:13:37,044 --> 01:13:38,644
- It is money well spent. / - I know. 

1783
01:13:38,644 --> 01:13:40,911
- You have to watch that match. / - Okay. 

1784
01:13:40,911 --> 01:13:43,544
Let's hear their finals words 

1785
01:13:43,544 --> 01:13:45,077
before the final vote. 

1786
01:13:45,077 --> 01:13:46,344
Jonghyuk, you go first. 

1787
01:13:46,344 --> 01:13:51,344
I guess some of you might not know The Beatles. 

1788
01:13:52,244 --> 01:13:54,644
But those who have heard of their music 

1789
01:13:54,644 --> 01:13:57,877
should go to Liverpool and take a look around there. 

1790
01:13:57,877 --> 01:14:01,677
Then you'd feel the place is worth visiting. 

1791
01:14:02,377 --> 01:14:04,277
- I highly recommend it. / - Alright then. 

1792
01:14:04,277 --> 01:14:07,477
Would you go to Liverpool, England, 

1793
01:14:07,477 --> 01:14:11,211
according to JJ Tour's plan? Please vote. 

1794
01:14:12,144 --> 01:14:14,344
(JJ Tour designed a trip to Liverpool) 

1795
01:14:14,344 --> 01:14:16,777
(What will the judges choose?) 

1796
01:14:17,511 --> 01:14:20,111
If Jonghyuk just finished that burger... 

1797
01:14:20,111 --> 01:14:23,811
- The trip would've cost a little over $100. / - Right. 

1798
01:14:24,311 --> 01:14:27,011
- The prize is $500. / - You're right! 

1799
01:14:27,011 --> 01:14:27,844
If you eat that burger... 

1800
01:14:27,844 --> 01:14:31,511
- Save $300. / - You can visit Liverpool for $100. 

1801
01:14:31,511 --> 01:14:33,144
Just finish that burger. 

1802
01:14:33,144 --> 01:14:34,744
You're right. 

1803
01:14:34,744 --> 01:14:37,077
One team will have their third straight win today. 

1804
01:14:37,077 --> 01:14:38,244
I'm sorry. 

1805
01:14:38,677 --> 01:14:40,311
- It's okay. / - Let's go. 

1806
01:14:41,477 --> 01:14:44,844
Will it be the HighMan Tour that did everything 

1807
01:14:44,844 --> 01:14:47,577
from great activities to eating great food. 

1808
01:14:47,577 --> 01:14:51,577
Is it the Manchester trip to England? 

1809
01:14:51,577 --> 01:14:53,477
They're the most influential band in history. 

1810
01:14:53,477 --> 01:14:55,044
The legendary Beatles. 

1811
01:14:55,044 --> 01:14:59,111
A pilgrimage to their home of Liverpool. 

1812
01:14:59,111 --> 01:15:02,311
JJ Tour's trip to Liverpool, England? 

1813
01:15:02,311 --> 01:15:06,111
What will the judges choose? 

1814
01:15:08,077 --> 01:15:09,411
Why does this make me nervous? 

1815
01:15:09,411 --> 01:15:10,444
- JJ. / - What is it? 

1816
01:15:10,444 --> 01:15:12,411
- Let's go with 3 victories. / - What is this? 

1817
01:15:12,411 --> 01:15:13,411
- JJ. / - 3 straight wins. 

1818
01:15:13,411 --> 01:15:14,877
- Let's get 3 wins. / - HighMan! 

1819
01:15:14,877 --> 01:15:16,811
The last digit first. 

1820
01:15:16,811 --> 01:15:18,377
Here it comes. 

1821
01:15:18,377 --> 01:15:20,011
The last digit first. 

1822
01:15:20,177 --> 01:15:22,011
Someone will get 3 wins. 

1823
01:15:22,011 --> 01:15:24,311
- 7! / - What the? 

1824
01:15:24,311 --> 01:15:25,544
It's the first digit. 

1825
01:15:26,044 --> 01:15:27,877
- What's going on? / - What is this? 

1826
01:15:27,877 --> 01:15:29,144
- It's similar? / - No! 

1827
01:15:29,144 --> 01:15:31,177
- HighMan! JJ! Who is it? / - HighMan! 

1828
01:15:31,177 --> 01:15:34,477
- HighMan! / - JJ! 

1829
01:15:37,744 --> 01:15:40,477
(Manchester wins!) 

1830
01:15:42,344 --> 01:15:44,011
(This guy doesn't get what happened) 

1831
01:15:46,077 --> 01:15:48,011
- What happened? / - We lost. 

1832
01:15:48,377 --> 01:15:49,511
- We lost. / - We lost. 

1833
01:15:49,511 --> 01:15:51,144
- I can't believe I won. / - We lost! 

1834
01:15:53,311 --> 01:15:54,177
What's going on? 

1835
01:15:54,177 --> 01:15:56,044
He thought we won. 

1836
01:15:57,644 --> 01:15:58,877
What were you looking at? 

1837
01:15:58,877 --> 01:16:01,277
- It was this side... / - After the win... 

1838
01:16:02,311 --> 01:16:05,444
Congratulations, Gikwang. 

1839
01:16:07,244 --> 01:16:09,444
That's 3 straight wins for Yoon Dujun. 

1840
01:16:09,444 --> 01:16:12,277
Yoon Dujun is a legend. 

1841
01:16:13,144 --> 01:16:13,944
Yoon Dujun. 

1842
01:16:14,811 --> 01:16:16,044
You lost by 2 votes... 

1843
01:16:16,044 --> 01:16:17,977
- But you had fun, right? / - It's a shame. 

1844
01:16:17,977 --> 01:16:21,477
I really wanted to visit Manchester 

1845
01:16:21,477 --> 01:16:23,944
like Dujun did. 

1846
01:16:23,944 --> 01:16:26,711
I'd really like to go back to England. 

1847
01:16:26,711 --> 01:16:29,877
Will you go with Minkyo? 

1848
01:16:29,877 --> 01:16:32,711
No, I'll go with Dujun who won 3 times. 

1849
01:16:33,444 --> 01:16:35,077
- That would be better. / - Alright. 

1850
01:16:35,077 --> 01:16:37,511
Taehun, you worked hard for 2 weeks. 

1851
01:16:37,511 --> 01:16:38,411
How was it? 

1852
01:16:38,411 --> 01:16:41,377
As I watched the two teams travel abroad, 

1853
01:16:41,377 --> 01:16:42,611
I want to go off somewhere 

1854
01:16:42,611 --> 01:16:45,477
since the weather is getting warmer. 

1855
01:16:46,577 --> 01:16:48,811
So we've been on a unique trip 

1856
01:16:48,811 --> 01:16:51,344
in England for the past two weeks. 

1857
01:16:51,344 --> 01:16:54,277
And we will have a special episode next week again. 

1858
01:16:54,877 --> 01:16:57,111
It's a huge special. 

1859
01:16:57,111 --> 01:17:00,077
Make sure you tune in. 

1860
01:17:00,077 --> 01:17:02,577
Look forward to the next episode. 

1861
01:17:02,577 --> 01:17:04,411
The world is a school. Life is a journey. 

1862
01:17:04,411 --> 01:17:06,611
Battle Trip! 

1863
01:17:06,611 --> 01:17:08,211
Thank you. 

1864

(Next episode) 

1865
01:17:10,648 --> 01:17:12,415
I didn't know there's a place like this in Bali. 

1866
01:17:12,415 --> 01:17:14,648
It's Penang in Malaysia. 

1867
01:17:14,648 --> 01:17:17,182
Reset Tour. Put everything back. 

1868
01:17:17,182 --> 01:17:19,115
Thrilling Tour. 

1869
01:17:19,115 --> 01:17:19,815
It's so pretty. 

1870
01:17:19,815 --> 01:17:22,148
- It's an interesting city. / - It really is. 

1871
01:17:23,182 --> 01:17:25,115
It's fine because I'm with you. 

1872
01:17:26,682 --> 01:17:28,782
True 100% Bali. 

1873
01:17:28,782 --> 01:17:30,815
Why are we here? Photo of a lifetime. 

1874
01:17:30,815 --> 01:17:32,015
It is pretty. 

1875
01:17:32,348 --> 01:17:34,448
A place of romantic love. 

1876
01:17:34,448 --> 01:17:36,748
Thank you for this unforgettable memory. 

1877
01:17:36,748 --> 01:17:39,015
It was actually my fantasy.
