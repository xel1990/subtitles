1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,274
I think I know why people say this is the best.

2
00:00:05,207 --> 00:00:05,974
This is fun.

3
00:00:05,974 --> 00:00:07,140
Is this what it was?

4
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:09,540
Let's find some inner peace here.

5
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:11,907
It's a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

6
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:15,340
This is the best.

7
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:17,207
This is so delicious.

8
00:00:17,674 --> 00:00:18,807
(Handle with care)

9
00:00:19,774 --> 00:00:21,540
It looks like a city of the future.

10
00:00:22,974 --> 00:00:24,240
I didn't know it would be so good.

11
00:00:25,607 --> 00:00:28,907
(Who will be the winning team?)

12
00:00:31,774 --> 00:00:34,740
(Numerous great tips on trips)

13
00:00:35,974 --> 00:00:37,274

(Special host, Kim Minkyoung)

16
00:00:44,007 --> 00:00:45,074
Travel is war!

17
00:00:45,074 --> 00:00:47,640
Battle Trip!

18
00:00:49,274 --> 00:00:50,474
Continuing on from last week...

19
00:00:50,474 --> 00:00:54,274
Counterattack of secondary travel destinations part 2.

20
00:00:54,274 --> 00:00:55,974
And we're with our planners.

21
00:00:55,974 --> 00:00:58,674
We have our 100 impartial judges

22
00:00:58,674 --> 00:01:00,574
who will vote on today's trips.

23
00:01:00,574 --> 00:01:01,807
Nice to meet you.

24
00:01:04,274 --> 00:01:05,607
- Shinyoung. / - Yes.

25
00:01:05,607 --> 00:01:07,574
You look excited today.

26
00:01:07,574 --> 00:01:08,574
I'm so excited.

27
00:01:08,574 --> 00:01:09,740
Because we're finally watching their trip.

28
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:10,574
Right.

29
00:01:10,574 --> 00:01:12,007
You look a little intimidated...

30
00:01:12,007 --> 00:01:13,407
- After watching our trip. / - Let's be honest.

31
00:01:13,407 --> 00:01:14,940
How did you like Hangzhou?

32
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:18,207
Hangzhou? I was impressed by its scale.

33
00:01:18,207 --> 00:01:21,074
But Kyoto has its own sensitivity.

34
00:01:21,074 --> 00:01:22,040
Sensitivity.

35
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:23,307
- Sensitive Kyoto. / - Sensitivity.

36
00:01:23,307 --> 00:01:24,907
- Sensitivity? / - Sensitivity is important.

37
00:01:24,907 --> 00:01:28,474
Our trip is designed to cater to Mimi.

38
00:01:28,474 --> 00:01:29,240
Because it's her first trip.

39
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:31,974
- Right. / - We planned the trip...

40
00:01:31,974 --> 00:01:34,340
For beginners, intermediate and advanced travelers.

41
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:37,840
We went to a place that even Japanese don't know.

42
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,540
For the first time in this show,

43
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:42,607
we show you 1 of the top 3 best views in Japan.

44
00:01:42,607 --> 00:01:44,507
- One of the best 3? / - It's a first.

45
00:01:44,507 --> 00:01:46,540
You've been to Japan so many times,

46
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:49,274
but it'll be your first time to see one of those views.

47
00:01:50,374 --> 00:01:51,574
- Mimi. / - Yes.

48
00:01:51,574 --> 00:01:53,374
Was it really the first trip of your whole life?

49
00:01:53,374 --> 00:01:56,674
I've never been to other countries

50
00:01:56,674 --> 00:01:57,440
unless it was for work.

51
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:59,674
It was my first trip to an overseas country.

52
00:01:59,674 --> 00:02:01,407
And Shinyoung is very busy...

53
00:02:01,407 --> 00:02:03,374
- With Celeb Five these days. / - She's very busy.

54
00:02:03,374 --> 00:02:05,407
- She took some time off for me. / - Two idols.

55
00:02:05,407 --> 00:02:07,374
That's right. We're idols. Both girl groups.

56
00:02:07,374 --> 00:02:09,507
- They are two idol artists. / - But they're different.

57
00:02:10,807 --> 00:02:12,307
You look cool.

58
00:02:12,307 --> 00:02:14,007
Actually,

59
00:02:14,007 --> 00:02:16,374
here I call her Mimi.

60
00:02:16,374 --> 00:02:18,274
But I address her as "senior" on music shows.

61
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,407
She says, "Found you! OH MY GIRL."

62
00:02:20,407 --> 00:02:24,407
And we say, "Please raise us up."

63
00:02:24,407 --> 00:02:25,840
We each have our greetings.

64
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:26,940
That's lovely.

65
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:28,974
How many times have you been to Kyoto?

66
00:02:28,974 --> 00:02:30,474
I've been around 30 times.

67
00:02:30,474 --> 00:02:32,074
- To Japan. / - You've been so many times.

68
00:02:32,074 --> 00:02:33,007
- She's an expert. / - She's been heaps of times.

69
00:02:33,007 --> 00:02:34,540
- She goes real often. / - You look confident.

70
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:35,974
She keeps smiling.

71
00:02:35,974 --> 00:02:36,740
That's because...

72
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:38,540
- She's been there 30 times. / - It's been 30 times.

73
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:42,707
When comedians like me, plan a trip to Japan,

74
00:02:42,707 --> 00:02:45,707
we ask Shinyoung where to go.

75
00:02:45,707 --> 00:02:46,740
She's that much of an expert.

76
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:50,074
So today's battle is Kyoto vs. Hangzhou.

77
00:02:50,074 --> 00:02:53,107
Let's find out where it's located.

78
00:02:53,107 --> 00:02:53,774
- It's Japan. / - Kyoto.

79
00:02:53,774 --> 00:02:55,640
- Japan... / - It's really close.

80
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:57,874
- It's Osaka. / - It's close.

81
00:02:57,874 --> 00:02:59,707
It takes about 1.5 hours by car with traffic.

82
00:02:59,707 --> 00:03:01,240
If you take the subway...

83
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,174
- There's a subway? / - Yes.

84
00:03:02,174 --> 00:03:03,774
- Yes, they do. / - Around 40 minutes.

85
00:03:03,774 --> 00:03:05,374
- So it's like going to Gyeongju. / - It's really close.

86
00:03:05,374 --> 00:03:06,974
- Gyeongju. / - Since it's the old capital.

87
00:03:06,974 --> 00:03:09,107
When we go to Kyoto...

88
00:03:09,107 --> 00:03:11,074
- We visit Kiyomizu Temple. / - Right.

89
00:03:11,074 --> 00:03:13,374
Ninenzaka and Sannenzaka are common places.

90
00:03:13,374 --> 00:03:14,907
We didn't go there.

91
00:03:14,907 --> 00:03:15,607
- You didn't? / - No?

92
00:03:15,607 --> 00:03:18,574
It's so fun to go on a trip with Shinyoung.

93
00:03:18,574 --> 00:03:21,440
She also went on trips with a lot of idols.

94
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,774
- I mostly go... / - You sent with Seolhyun.

95
00:03:22,774 --> 00:03:24,407
- With Seolhyun... / - Seolhyun of AOA...

96
00:03:24,407 --> 00:03:25,640
- You've traveled with Jimin. / - Jimin.

97
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:27,674
Do you have some criteria for choosing your partner?

98
00:03:27,674 --> 00:03:29,740
People who are going for the first time.

99
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:30,374
First trips.

100
00:03:30,374 --> 00:03:31,707
- Joining them on their first trip. / - Our job...

101
00:03:31,707 --> 00:03:33,207
Is to give people laughter.

102
00:03:33,207 --> 00:03:36,540
I wanted to give Mimi another form of joy.

103
00:03:37,307 --> 00:03:38,374
I mean it.

104
00:03:38,374 --> 00:03:39,807
When Shinyoung goes on a trip,

105
00:03:39,807 --> 00:03:41,407
there are things she does

106
00:03:41,407 --> 00:03:43,474
to have a good time on a trip.

107
00:03:43,474 --> 00:03:44,840
- Give us some tips. / - In the past...

108
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:45,907
It was getting blind drunk.

109
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:48,374
- Really? / - That's right.

110
00:03:48,374 --> 00:03:50,274
I don't search for

111
00:03:50,274 --> 00:03:51,774
good restaurants beforehand.

112
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:53,574
I just take a cab.

113
00:03:53,574 --> 00:03:54,640
I get in a cab and...

114
00:03:55,374 --> 00:03:58,174
I ask the driver to take me to a good restaurant.

115
00:03:58,174 --> 00:03:59,340
- That's right. / - Cab driver favorites.

116
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:00,540
I have no clue about the place

117
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:02,674
but he just takes me there.

118
00:04:02,674 --> 00:04:03,907
- And the food's really good. / - In Japan?

119
00:04:03,907 --> 00:04:04,940
- Yes, in Japan. / - You can do that?

120
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:06,340
- In any country. / - You need to speak the language.

121
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:07,907
- This is a great tip. / - No, wait.

122
00:04:07,907 --> 00:04:09,440
If the driver asks questions,

123
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:10,974
we have those apps nowadays.

124
00:04:10,974 --> 00:04:13,840
If you don't speak the language, use the app.

125
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,840
- Then... / - They'll really make the effort to tell you.

126
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,840
They will recommend a restaurant for you.

127
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:21,440
I get off the cab and take a selfie with him.

128
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,874
- How nice of them. / - It's a really good place.

129
00:04:22,874 --> 00:04:23,807
They help you to the end.

130
00:04:23,807 --> 00:04:25,274
Right to the end.

131
00:04:25,274 --> 00:04:25,974
That's really fun.

132
00:04:25,974 --> 00:04:28,640
- But the cab fare will be $10. / - No, no.

133
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:29,674
It won't be $150.

134
00:04:29,674 --> 00:04:31,974
We only traveled within Kyoto.

135
00:04:31,974 --> 00:04:33,740
We walked around on foot.

136
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:37,674
You two wouldn't need an interpreter in Japan.

137
00:04:37,674 --> 00:04:39,507
- That's right. / - We didn't need an interpreter.

138
00:04:39,507 --> 00:04:40,440
We really didn't need one.

139
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:43,140
I studied Japanese since I was a trainee.

140
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:43,974
She's really fluent.

141
00:04:43,974 --> 00:04:46,007
- I can communicate in Japanese. / - Yes.

142
00:04:46,007 --> 00:04:49,740
Teach us some words we need to say in Japanese.

143
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:52,440
First, there are some easy ones.

144
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:54,507
It's one or two when you order food.

145
00:04:54,507 --> 00:04:55,407
- It's really simple. / - Hitotsu.

146
00:04:55,407 --> 00:04:56,407
Hitotsu.

147
00:04:56,407 --> 00:04:57,240
Futatsu.

148
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:58,874
- Hitotsu. Futatsu. / - You don't need more than that.

149
00:04:58,874 --> 00:04:59,640
- Says who? / - What about three?

150
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:01,007
Three?

151
00:05:01,007 --> 00:05:02,374
Three.

152
00:05:04,274 --> 00:05:05,574
- One, two, three. / - Three.

153
00:05:05,574 --> 00:05:06,474
Three.

154
00:05:06,474 --> 00:05:08,674
Shinyoung speaks Cantonese.

155
00:05:08,674 --> 00:05:09,974
She can sing in Cantonese.

156
00:05:09,974 --> 00:05:11,040
Of course.

157
00:05:15,507 --> 00:05:16,907
Holding hands?

158
00:05:16,907 --> 00:05:17,774
What is this?

159
00:05:22,174 --> 00:05:23,074
"Smiling Angel."

160
00:05:23,074 --> 00:05:23,874
No.

161
00:05:23,874 --> 00:05:26,174
♪ It'd be nice ♪

162
00:05:26,174 --> 00:05:30,507

163
00:05:30,507 --> 00:05:31,474
I can hear it.

164
00:05:31,474 --> 00:05:32,440
I heard it.

165
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:33,274
You can hear it.

166
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:37,174
- Excuse me. / - ♪ Say good-bye ♪

167
00:05:37,174 --> 00:05:39,174
- ♪ Say good-bye ♪ / - Shinyoung.

168
00:05:39,174 --> 00:05:40,674
We have to check out your video.

169
00:05:40,674 --> 00:05:41,507
Okay.

170
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:45,940
We'll be heading to Kyoto now.

171
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:50,474
Kyoto was Japan's capital for 1,000 years.

172
00:05:50,474 --> 00:05:52,074
Kyoto is rich in history.

173
00:05:52,074 --> 00:05:56,440
There are 17 World Heritage Sites.

174
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:58,507
World Heritage...

175
00:05:58,507 --> 00:05:59,740
You walk around and it's UNESCO.

176
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:01,940
That's amazing. 17 World Heritage Sites.

177
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:03,640
Also, don't you remember?

178
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:05,874
In Taiwan, my eyebrows of truth.

179
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:09,607
- You remember, right? / - When you eat...

180
00:06:09,607 --> 00:06:10,440
Something delicious.

181
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:11,640
- Your eyebrows react. / - Seriously, people...

182
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:12,774
You just need to know one thing.

183
00:06:12,774 --> 00:06:15,674
Whether my eyebrows move or not.

184
00:06:15,674 --> 00:06:16,740
Just think about that.

185
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:18,040
Okay.

186
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:20,340
Tell us the tour name, and we'll start.

187
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:21,974
You'll probably remember this.

188
00:06:22,974 --> 00:06:24,174
We made a remake.

189
00:06:24,174 --> 00:06:25,307
- Whether you go... / - Kyoto!

190
00:06:25,307 --> 00:06:26,540
- Whether you don't... / - Kyoto!

191
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:28,807
- If you'll regret it... / - Go to Kyoto!

192
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:30,674
Let's begin.

193
00:06:32,574 --> 00:06:35,074
I really know my way around Tokyo.

194
00:06:35,074 --> 00:06:38,707
You can walk around even without a car.

195
00:06:38,707 --> 00:06:40,274
I've been to Kyoto two times.

196
00:06:40,274 --> 00:06:42,240
Once I went with a friend.

197
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:46,774
Last year, I went with just Seolhyun.

198
00:06:46,774 --> 00:06:48,307
She still wants to go back.

199
00:06:49,707 --> 00:06:51,507
I take so many people on trips.

200
00:06:51,507 --> 00:06:53,507
We buy each other's clothes.

201
00:06:53,507 --> 00:06:55,940
I remember that street I walked on for 30 minutes.

202
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:57,640
- She's been a lot. / - A lot.

203
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:02,474
Last time, on Battle Trip,

204
00:07:02,474 --> 00:07:03,474
I went with Shindong.

205
00:07:03,474 --> 00:07:05,874
- It was a co-ed episode. / - That was so fun.

206
00:07:05,874 --> 00:07:09,207
This time it's like going with the youngest.

207
00:07:09,207 --> 00:07:11,040
I've been in a girl group now, so I know.

208
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:12,874
Of course.

209
00:07:12,874 --> 00:07:14,774
You have no free time.

210
00:07:14,774 --> 00:07:17,307
Your 20s is the best time of your life.

211
00:07:17,307 --> 00:07:18,374
It's when you should have the most fun.

212
00:07:18,374 --> 00:07:20,740
But she's never been on a trip before.

213
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:22,640
So I said, "Let's go together."

214
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:24,607
But I didn't want to pay.

215
00:07:26,407 --> 00:07:27,574
That's why I asked Battle Trip.

216
00:07:27,574 --> 00:07:28,274
I'm just kidding.

217
00:07:28,274 --> 00:07:30,040
I have so many good memories

218
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:32,440
of having a fun on Battle Trip.

219
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:36,640
It got rid of all my prejudice against Taiwan.

220
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:39,074
So I hope she has fun too.

221
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,507
Come in already.

222
00:07:43,507 --> 00:07:44,574
Hello.

223
00:07:44,574 --> 00:07:45,807
You really dressed up.

224
00:07:45,807 --> 00:07:46,774
Hello.

225
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:49,740
She's so pretty.

226
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:51,507
Pretty.

227
00:07:51,507 --> 00:07:54,574
(She's actually a charismatic rapper)

228
00:07:56,307 --> 00:07:58,807
Five, five, five, five, five. Celeb Five.

229
00:07:58,807 --> 00:08:00,040
I'm the leader, Kim Shinyoung.

230
00:08:00,674 --> 00:08:02,407
Found you! OH MY GIRL.

231
00:08:02,407 --> 00:08:03,807
I'm Mimi of OH MY GIRL.

232
00:08:03,807 --> 00:08:05,474
That's us.

233
00:08:05,474 --> 00:08:06,974
Yay!

234
00:08:06,974 --> 00:08:08,274
It's a meeting between girl groups.

235
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,240
We got close when

236
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,440
I hosted OH MY GIRL's showcases.

237
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:15,207
Three of them now.

238
00:08:15,207 --> 00:08:16,240
So many...

239
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:19,007
We only met for business.

240
00:08:19,007 --> 00:08:20,407
But she's really country

241
00:08:20,407 --> 00:08:21,674
and innocent.

242
00:08:21,674 --> 00:08:24,040
She takes such good care of me.

243
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:24,807
She really does.

244
00:08:24,807 --> 00:08:27,574
She always buys me good food.

245
00:08:27,574 --> 00:08:31,240
We talk at least once a day on the phone.

246
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:31,874
Really?

247
00:08:31,874 --> 00:08:33,440
One call per day.

248
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,074
You're really close.

249
00:08:35,074 --> 00:08:35,940
That's not easy to do.

250
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:38,174
We always do video calls.

251
00:08:38,174 --> 00:08:40,140
I always see her updates on Instagram.

252
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:41,574
She posts a lot.

253
00:08:41,574 --> 00:08:43,740
Please say, "SNS."

254
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:45,007
I see her updates on SNS.

255
00:08:45,007 --> 00:08:46,874
I have to teach her a lot of things like this.

256
00:08:46,874 --> 00:08:49,407
I need to teach her since I am a senior.

257
00:08:49,407 --> 00:08:50,607
- SNS, okay? / - Understood.

258
00:08:52,474 --> 00:08:53,207
You're like a mom.

259
00:08:53,207 --> 00:08:54,140
Okay, okay.

260
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:54,807
We hold hands.

261
00:08:54,807 --> 00:08:56,840
We're really affectionate with each other.

262
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:58,207
We even kiss.

263
00:08:58,207 --> 00:08:59,174
Yes, we kiss...

264
00:09:00,207 --> 00:09:01,840
What's wrong with you?

265
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:03,540
You're thinking naughty thoughts.

266
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:04,774
- I just like you, is all. / - Alright, alright.

267
00:09:04,774 --> 00:09:06,940
- They seem really different to us. / - Yes.

268
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:08,640
They actually look like close friends.

269
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,040
- We're close. / - We are.

270
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:11,474
What do you want to do on a trip?

271
00:09:11,474 --> 00:09:12,474
What comes to mind?

272
00:09:12,474 --> 00:09:13,340
We have to eat.

273
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:14,040
Food.

274
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:15,640
Eating, and bike riding.

283

- Kyoto. / - Sure.

290

299

300
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:05,007
- You must go there. / - You must buy it.

It's like the Japanese version of Gyeongju.

365
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:13,640
- Gyeongju. / - Yeah.

366
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:14,340
That's what it's like here.

367
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:15,607
There must be a lot of good food.

368
00:12:15,607 --> 00:12:17,807
There's lot of good food and lots of cool stuff to see.

369
00:12:19,507 --> 00:12:20,807
- First... / - Where are we going?

370
00:12:20,807 --> 00:12:22,507
There's a place that really stands out.

371
00:12:22,507 --> 00:12:23,240
Where?

372
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:24,707
We'll go there first.

373
00:12:24,707 --> 00:12:26,840
It's called Higashi Honganji.

374
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:28,374
It's a historical site in Kyoto.

375
00:12:28,374 --> 00:12:29,640
- This place here. / - It's really natural.

376
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:31,274
This place is so cool.

377
00:12:31,274 --> 00:12:33,507
We walked about 10 minutes from the station.

378
00:12:33,507 --> 00:12:34,740
It's just on the way.

379
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:36,274
Things like this...

380
00:12:36,274 --> 00:12:38,374
On this street,

381
00:12:38,374 --> 00:12:40,440
they sell heaps of mochi.

382
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:43,040
- There's a lot of street food. / - Yes.

383
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,840
These are crepes.

384
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:46,840
You have to eat crepes when you're in Japan.

385
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:48,740
This is amazing.

386
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:49,740
(Oh, my)

387
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:50,640
Look at this. It's a carp.

388
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:51,707
It's a fish.

389
00:12:51,707 --> 00:12:53,440
- Isn't this so nice? / - That is so interesting.

390
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,740
His face is green.

391
00:12:56,407 --> 00:12:57,940
The streets are so pretty.

392
00:12:57,940 --> 00:12:59,374
I'm so happy.

393
00:13:01,907 --> 00:13:03,107
I'm so happy.

394
00:13:03,107 --> 00:13:04,840
Both of you look so happy.

395
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:05,407
- Of course. / - That's right.

396
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:07,607
- Don't we look happy? / - Yes.

397
00:13:07,607 --> 00:13:12,140
You'll walk a lot when you travel with me.

398
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:12,974
That's good.

399
00:13:12,974 --> 00:13:14,040
It's different

400
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:16,340
when you walk around on a trip

401
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:18,374
and when you ride a car.

402
00:13:18,374 --> 00:13:20,140
- They're totally different. / - Yes.

403
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:21,640
That's why I walk.

404
00:13:22,874 --> 00:13:24,807
This is Higashi Honganji.

405
00:13:25,774 --> 00:13:26,840
It's really big.

406
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:28,140
It's one of the three famous gates.

407
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:30,307
Like Dongdaemun and Namdaemun.

408
00:13:30,307 --> 00:13:31,040
Let's go.

409
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,374
- I gave her a simple explanation. / - Let's go.

410
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:34,407
It's all catered to her.

411
00:13:34,407 --> 00:13:35,740
- It really was. / - It was all catered.

412
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:39,040
- It's so big. / - Right?

413
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:42,107
This is a historical site of Kyoto.

414
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:45,707
It doesn't matter which country it is,

415
00:13:45,707 --> 00:13:48,107
these majestic sites are always cool.

416
00:13:48,107 --> 00:13:49,340
They have this sense of dignity.

417
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:50,374
- That's right. / - Dignity.

418
00:13:50,374 --> 00:13:51,407
So it's like this...

419
00:13:51,407 --> 00:13:54,840
- It's really grand. / - You don't have to know too much.

420
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:57,174
This is Higashi Honganji

421
00:13:57,174 --> 00:13:58,807
and it's a wooden structure.

422
00:13:58,807 --> 00:14:00,107
That's all you need to know.

423
00:14:00,107 --> 00:14:01,307
Just have a look around.

424
00:14:01,307 --> 00:14:02,374
Let's just have a look around.

425
00:14:02,374 --> 00:14:04,107
You can come here again when you have time.

426
00:14:04,107 --> 00:14:05,074
That's what it's like.

427
00:14:05,074 --> 00:14:06,874
We still have lots of places to go.

428
00:14:06,874 --> 00:14:07,940
It's like...

429
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:09,374
Wherever you walk...

430
00:14:09,374 --> 00:14:11,307
Look, everyone's walking on foot.

431
00:14:12,607 --> 00:14:15,007
Everything is close by in Kyoto.

432
00:14:16,507 --> 00:14:18,174
It's really pretty.

433
00:14:18,174 --> 00:14:19,340
- It is, right? / - Yeah.

434
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:21,807
That hotel is where Seolhyun and I stayed together.

435
00:14:21,807 --> 00:14:22,940
- Really? / - Yes.

436
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:26,807
Whenever it's someone's first trip, I go to Kyoto.

437
00:14:26,807 --> 00:14:28,640
You present them a great trip.

438
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:31,674
Kyoto is the first destination that comes to my mind.

439
00:14:31,674 --> 00:14:32,607
I have good memories here.

440
00:14:32,607 --> 00:14:34,074
I get reminded of the city.

441
00:14:34,074 --> 00:14:35,974
I walked around a lot with Seolhyun.

442
00:14:35,974 --> 00:14:37,907
My Japanese teacher also said...

443
00:14:37,907 --> 00:14:40,274
- You can never see enough of Kyoto. / - She's right.

444
00:14:40,274 --> 00:14:42,074
Even if you get lost, it's fun.

445
00:14:43,174 --> 00:14:44,174
That's what traveling is like.

446
00:14:44,174 --> 00:14:46,474
Even if we get lost, I think it'd be nice.

447
00:14:46,474 --> 00:14:47,940
It doesn't upset you.

448
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:49,040
I'm glad I put sneakers on.

449
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,474
I think one should wear sneakers here.

450
00:14:50,474 --> 00:14:51,340
You're right.

451
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:52,407
Because you have to walk.

452
00:14:52,407 --> 00:14:53,874
Of course.

453
00:14:53,874 --> 00:14:55,574
You're truly free to go where you please.

454
00:14:55,574 --> 00:14:57,007
I really planned it like that.

455
00:14:57,007 --> 00:14:58,007
That's a common street.

456
00:14:58,007 --> 00:14:59,574
- With lots of good eats. / - Right.

457
00:14:59,574 --> 00:15:00,840
You have to take photos there.

458
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:01,774
- It's just... / - The street itself.

459
00:15:01,774 --> 00:15:02,474
Anywhere you go is a magazine cover.

460
00:15:02,474 --> 00:15:04,840
You can comfortably walk the streets.

461
00:15:07,174 --> 00:15:09,140
- It looks like a movie. / - It's her first trip abroad.

462
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:11,807
- Just walking made her happy. / - Let's go in.

463
00:15:11,807 --> 00:15:13,074
- It's Nishiki Market. / - Nishiki Market.

464
00:15:13,074 --> 00:15:13,907
It's Nishiki Market.

465
00:15:14,474 --> 00:15:15,774
It's a market.

466
00:15:15,774 --> 00:15:18,140
It's the kitchen of Kyoto.

467
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:19,340
It has 400 years of history.

468
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:20,707
- Is this also 400 years old? / - Yes.

469
00:15:21,507 --> 00:15:24,140
There are over 1,400 stores in the market.

470
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:26,874
- It looks amazing. / - This is the stuff.

471
00:15:27,907 --> 00:15:30,307
(It's amazing)

472
00:15:32,107 --> 00:15:34,007
It's incredibly old.

473
00:15:34,007 --> 00:15:35,540
It'll be very crowded.

474
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:36,607
But all the food is delicious.

475
00:15:36,607 --> 00:15:37,774
- There are so many people. / - Let's go.

476
00:15:37,774 --> 00:15:39,374
- Let's buy everything. / - Okay.

477
00:15:40,107 --> 00:15:41,140
You're hungry, aren't you?

478
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:42,907
That was the plan all along

479
00:15:42,907 --> 00:15:43,240
Really?

480
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:44,874
Everything's good once you work up a sweat.

481
00:15:44,874 --> 00:15:46,674
Let's try different foods...

482
00:15:46,674 --> 00:15:47,707
And choose the best ones?

483
00:15:47,707 --> 00:15:50,007
We'll choose the best ones for gifts.

484
00:15:50,007 --> 00:15:51,440
Sounds good, sounds good.

485
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,407
That's fascinating.

486
00:15:52,407 --> 00:15:53,374
What is?

487
00:15:53,374 --> 00:15:54,307
Look at the octopus.

488
00:15:54,307 --> 00:15:56,907
- That's so cute. / - They were really good.

489
00:15:56,907 --> 00:15:58,174
It's so cute, I want to eat it right now.

490
00:15:58,174 --> 00:15:59,007
Pocket octopus.

491
00:15:59,007 --> 00:15:59,807
That's cruel.

492
00:15:59,807 --> 00:16:02,007
- Everyone's looking. / - That was delicious.

493
00:16:02,007 --> 00:16:03,140
Two.

494
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:04,374
Want to try this one?

495
00:16:04,374 --> 00:16:06,040
- One. / - One, please.

496
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:10,907
It's good.

497
00:16:10,907 --> 00:16:11,674
- Is it? / - Yeah.

498
00:16:12,474 --> 00:16:13,940
It's slightly...

499
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:14,674
That was so good.

500
00:16:15,874 --> 00:16:17,740
(So nice)

501
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:21,107
It's delicious, isn't it?

502
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:25,574
It's so sweet.

503
00:16:25,574 --> 00:16:26,674
Want another one?

504
00:16:26,674 --> 00:16:28,174
- Eat another one? / - Eat another one.

505
00:16:28,174 --> 00:16:29,640
One more please.

506
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:30,907
Shinyoung's let go.

507
00:16:30,907 --> 00:16:32,507
We bought another skewer.

508
00:16:32,507 --> 00:16:33,340
You have to.

509
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:34,640
You have to eat one each.

510
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:36,240
You shouldn't miss scallops.

511
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,174
Welcome to the world of scallops.

512
00:16:39,774 --> 00:16:40,807
It's so delicious.

513
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:43,507
We tried that one.

514
00:16:44,507 --> 00:16:45,440
- It's just a beginning. / - Shall we begin?

515
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:48,174
- You must try parboiled octopus. / - Looks delicious.

516
00:16:48,874 --> 00:16:49,907
There's eel inside.

517
00:16:49,907 --> 00:16:51,440
- Octopus. / - Egg rolls.

518
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,574
You must eat that.

519
00:16:52,574 --> 00:16:53,440
You must.

520
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:55,707
- Let's eat eel. / - The good thing about this place...

521
00:16:55,707 --> 00:16:57,074
You don't just buy it and leave.

522
00:16:57,074 --> 00:16:58,340
There are places you can eat.

523
00:16:58,340 --> 00:16:59,607
- Next door, like that. / - Separately.

524
00:17:07,107 --> 00:17:08,040
It's just one bite.

525
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:09,740
Just a single bite.

526
00:17:10,674 --> 00:17:11,974
(Chomp)

527
00:17:13,407 --> 00:17:14,240
Do you like it?

528
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,407
I love eel.

529
00:17:15,407 --> 00:17:16,840
It was so delicious.

530
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:17,974
It looks delicious.

531
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:20,640
Everything tastes good.

532
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:21,740
That one looks so good.

533
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:22,907
- Eel egg roll is delicious. / - Seriously.

534
00:17:22,907 --> 00:17:24,074
It's insanely good.

535
00:17:26,174 --> 00:17:27,340
It's good.

536
00:17:27,340 --> 00:17:28,207
Is it good?

537
00:17:28,207 --> 00:17:29,340
I want to eat it again.

538
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:34,374
- They look so pretty. / - This is interesting.

539
00:17:34,374 --> 00:17:35,540
How could fish cakes be so pretty?

540
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:36,474
Yeah.

541
00:17:36,474 --> 00:17:37,674
The fish cakes are so pretty.

542
00:17:37,674 --> 00:17:39,307
You must not miss

543
00:17:39,307 --> 00:17:41,407
this kind of food in Japan.

544
00:17:46,474 --> 00:17:47,674
It's the Eyebrow Tour.

545
00:17:47,674 --> 00:17:48,674
Seriously, my eyebrows...

546
00:17:48,674 --> 00:17:50,074
It's really sweet.

547
00:17:50,074 --> 00:17:51,007
Is it sweet?

548
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:53,140
- So cute. / - They're so plump.

549
00:17:53,807 --> 00:17:55,540
It's so chewy.

00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:56,874
- It's so good. / - So much stuffing.

551
00:17:56,874 --> 00:17:59,807
- You must try the fish cakes. / - That's bacon.

552
00:17:59,807 --> 00:18:02,240
Because it's all handmade.

553
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:03,207
Everything's handmade.

554
00:18:03,207 --> 00:18:04,574
- That was good too. / - They cook it right before you.

555
00:18:04,574 --> 00:18:06,707
- Mimi! / - It's so good!

556
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:10,040
Minkyoung is having a hard time.

557
00:18:10,707 --> 00:18:13,274
- Mimi! / - That was so good!

558
00:18:13,274 --> 00:18:16,007
- It's so good. / - Just one bite!

559
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:19,174
It's a pollack roe egg roll!

560
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:21,874
It's so good.

561
00:18:21,874 --> 00:18:23,540
Excuse me.

562
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:26,107
One pineapple juice please.

563
00:18:29,274 --> 00:18:30,074
They juice it just like that.

564
00:18:30,074 --> 00:18:32,307
- They juice it whole. / - Just like that.

565
00:18:32,307 --> 00:18:34,640
Don't you drink that in Southeast Asia?

566
00:18:36,707 --> 00:18:38,307
It's worth $10.

567
00:18:38,307 --> 00:18:39,540
- Really? / - Yeah.

568
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:41,774
(Slurp)

569
00:18:42,407 --> 00:18:43,440
This is madness.

570
00:18:44,507 --> 00:18:45,840
Isn't it amazing?

571
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:47,407
- It's so good. / - It's so good, right?

572
00:18:47,407 --> 00:18:49,707
We should've asked him to juice some more.

573
00:18:49,707 --> 00:18:51,940
I really want to eat the fish cake and pineapple.

574
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:52,840
We ate a lot.

575
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,007
Wait a minute.

576
00:18:54,007 --> 00:18:55,507
Didn't you guys just arrive there?

577
00:18:56,540 --> 00:18:58,474
You have to eat like that.

578
00:18:58,474 --> 00:18:59,607
You have to eat like that on trips.

579
00:18:59,607 --> 00:19:00,574
$40.

580
00:19:00,574 --> 00:19:02,074
- $40 worth. / - You can't help it.

581
00:19:02,074 --> 00:19:03,074
$50.

582
00:19:03,074 --> 00:19:03,907
Mochi, mochi.

583
00:19:03,907 --> 00:19:05,940
- We're not eating too much. / - Right.

584
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:07,640
We're just excited about the taste and the vibe.

585
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:09,407
They're cherries.

586
00:19:09,407 --> 00:19:11,074
One, please.

587
00:19:11,074 --> 00:19:12,440
This is just a snack, right?

588
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:13,774
- It's just a snack. / - Just a snack.

589
00:19:15,207 --> 00:19:16,807
Would Japanese people feel like us

590
00:19:16,807 --> 00:19:17,840
at Mangwon Market?

591
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:19,774
Right?

592
00:19:19,774 --> 00:19:21,074
- Right now... / - Mangwon Market.

593
00:19:21,074 --> 00:19:23,307
We're walking around the Japanese Mangwon Market.

594
00:19:25,474 --> 00:19:29,374
(Nishiki Market is the kitchen of Kyoto)

595
00:19:34,907 --> 00:19:35,874
Egg roll.

596
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:38,174
I love these.

597
00:19:38,174 --> 00:19:39,140
What is this?

598
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:40,174
Pickled dishes.

599
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:44,974
- It tastes great with rice in water. / - Right.

600
00:19:44,974 --> 00:19:47,074
You can buy it in Korea too,

601
00:19:47,074 --> 00:19:49,607
but you must try the local one.

602
00:19:49,607 --> 00:19:51,607
Looks like you're on our side, Sohyun.

603
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:54,374
She's on the Kyoto team already.

604
00:19:55,674 --> 00:19:56,940
(Popcorn)

605
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,340
(The eyebrows of truth react)

606
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:00,340
I'll buy you some.

607
00:20:01,307 --> 00:20:03,174
This is why you travel with your seniors.

608
00:20:03,174 --> 00:20:05,974
A bigger one please.

609
00:20:07,174 --> 00:20:07,774
Look at those roasted chestnuts.

610
00:20:07,774 --> 00:20:11,507
- Aren't roasted chestnuts just for winter? / - No.

611
00:20:11,507 --> 00:20:12,674
Thank you.

612
00:20:12,674 --> 00:20:14,307
Careful it's hot.

613
00:20:16,074 --> 00:20:17,874
You're indeed an idol.

614
00:20:17,874 --> 00:20:18,774
Idol?

615
00:20:18,774 --> 00:20:19,674
Idol.

616
00:20:19,674 --> 00:20:21,240
Korean idol.

617
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:23,040
I'm the Nishiki idol.

618
00:20:23,707 --> 00:20:25,307
- Nishiki idol. / - Nishiki idol.

619

00:20:29,474 --> 00:20:30,907
- Thank you. / - Thank you.

622
00:20:30,907 --> 00:20:32,374
Thank you for the food.

623
00:20:32,374 --> 00:20:33,940
They're so nice.

624
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:36,307
They give you 5 to 6 samples.

625
00:20:36,307 --> 00:20:37,540
- You must be full. / - They're really nice.

626
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:38,507
Ice cream.

627
00:20:38,507 --> 00:20:40,607
Shinyoung, Shinyoung.

628
00:20:40,607 --> 00:20:42,407
This is too much.

629
00:20:43,474 --> 00:20:46,607
The 2nd best dish? 1, 2, 3.

630
00:20:46,607 --> 00:20:47,674
Scallops.

631
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:50,774
Scallops were so good.

632
00:20:50,774 --> 00:20:53,307
Best dish. 1, 2, 3.

633
00:20:53,307 --> 00:20:55,274
- Pineapple. / - Pineapple.

634
00:20:55,274 --> 00:20:58,007
- What? / - It wasn't the pineapple.

635
00:20:59,407 --> 00:21:00,940
To be honest, it was the fish cakes.

636
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:02,507
- Fish cakes? / - The fish cakes were so good.

637
00:21:02,507 --> 00:21:04,074
- I want to try the pineapple. / - Ginger!

638
00:21:04,074 --> 00:21:07,074
It wasn't too strong and the texture was nice.

639
00:21:07,074 --> 00:21:08,474
- Pineapple for you? / - Yes.

640
00:21:08,474 --> 00:21:09,807
- The pineapple was insane. / - It was so good.

641
00:21:09,807 --> 00:21:10,940
I gulped it down.

642
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:12,974
- But it made me angry. / - Why?

643
00:21:12,974 --> 00:21:15,140
- He should've juiced up more. / - Right.

644
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:20,240
When you go there, ask them to juice up more.

645
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:22,807
- Our second stop is... / - Vintage shop?

646
00:21:22,807 --> 00:21:24,307

- He's totally my type. / - You have matching beanies.

656
00:21:48,874 --> 00:21:49,874
Is this fate?

657
00:21:50,574 --> 00:21:51,607
Isn't he really handsome?

(Prettying herself up)

663
00:22:03,607 --> 00:22:05,740
- Director, do I look okay? / - What are you doing?

664
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:09,007
That was you prettying up?

665
00:22:09,007 --> 00:22:10,640
He's so handsome.

666
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:12,940
- The workers here dress so well. / - I know.

667
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:14,807
A short passionate romance.

668
00:22:15,274 --> 00:22:17,974
- I imagine it sometimes. / - Imagine what?

669
00:22:17,974 --> 00:22:20,207
Shinyoung's imagination becomes reality.

670
00:22:20,207 --> 00:22:21,640
Isn't he really handsome?

671
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:24,540
He's even better in person.

672

Is there a smallest size of this?

This is the smallest size.

682
00:22:46,674 --> 00:22:48,974
Shinyoung likes red and yellow.

683
00:22:48,974 --> 00:22:51,374
We picked clothes for each other.

684
00:22:51,374 --> 00:22:53,440
- I'll turn you into a celeb... / - Since you're close.

685
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:56,507
In anyone's eyes here in Kyoto.

Nice.

687
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:02,840
I chose that.

688
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:05,074
Kim Mimi...

689
00:23:05,074 --> 00:23:06,440
I chose that outfit.

690
00:23:07,607 --> 00:23:09,107
Good choice.

691
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:14,540
(This is a celeb)

692
00:23:15,074 --> 00:23:17,807
- Anyone can tell... / - That's the celeb style.

693
00:23:18,307 --> 00:23:19,740
So out there.

So pretty.

695
00:23:21,174 --> 00:23:23,874
- Mimi did it. / - Celeb.

696
00:23:24,607 --> 00:23:25,607
Someone took my photo.

697
00:23:25,607 --> 00:23:27,707
A Westerner took a photo of her.

698
00:23:27,707 --> 00:23:30,174
- For real? / - She really liked her look.

699
00:23:30,174 --> 00:23:31,840
My goal was right.

700
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:35,774
I told you I'd turn her into a Kyoto celeb.

701
00:23:35,774 --> 00:23:37,140
They're taking photos of her. It's going off.

702
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:39,840
I did it. My styling is a success.

703
00:23:40,307 --> 00:23:41,074
(Hiding)

704
00:23:41,774 --> 00:23:44,007
Wasn't that a Japanese kid?

705
00:23:44,674 --> 00:23:47,340
Is that kindergartener going home?

706
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:49,007
Waiting for her big sister.

707
00:23:49,874 --> 00:23:52,007
- This street is nice, right? / - I love it.

708
00:23:52,007 --> 00:23:54,207
Can you think of the equivalent in Korea?

709
00:23:54,207 --> 00:23:55,940
- Hanok Village. / - That's right.

710
00:23:55,940 --> 00:23:57,974
If Jeonju has the Hanok Village,

711
00:23:57,974 --> 00:24:00,674
Kyoto has this traditional area.

712
00:24:00,674 --> 00:24:03,807
So pretty, right? This is Gion Street.

713
00:24:04,974 --> 00:24:07,674
You can just walk around everywhere.

714
00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:10,574
This is the spot. Check this out.

715
00:24:11,107 --> 00:24:12,740
That's amazing.

716
00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:15,307
You can see the river flowing.

717
00:24:15,307 --> 00:24:16,407
So pretty, right?

718
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:19,340
This is amazing. Why is the water so clean?

719
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:22,607
- Right? / - I wanted to keep showing her nice things.

720
00:24:22,607 --> 00:24:23,774
As much as I could.

721
00:24:23,774 --> 00:24:25,840
- That's how you feel. / - I want to get coffee here.

722
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:26,907
- Incredible. / - Though I don't drink coffee.

723
00:24:26,907 --> 00:24:29,407
Here... But you don't drink coffee.

724
00:24:29,407 --> 00:24:31,674
I don't drink coffee...

725
00:24:31,674 --> 00:24:34,207
- You can drink something else then. / - You're right.

726
00:24:35,274 --> 00:24:37,507
The streets are so beautiful. It's crazy.

727
00:24:37,507 --> 00:24:39,774
- How happy would she be? / - I remember.

728
00:24:39,774 --> 00:24:42,074
I don't think I'll ever forget this.

729
00:24:42,074 --> 00:24:43,740
Keep treasuring this with your eyes.

730
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:47,540
- Look at this. / - Kyoto is so nice.

731
00:24:48,274 --> 00:24:49,540
Isn't this amazing?

732
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:52,740
- How is it? / - I love it.

733
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:54,207
- Do you love it? / - Yes.

734
00:24:54,207 --> 00:24:56,774
Mimi, go.

735
00:24:56,774 --> 00:24:58,274
You need to take photos here.

736
00:24:58,274 --> 00:25:00,874
You must when it comes to wings.

737
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:04,540
- Isn't it so pretty? / - I look like I have long legs.

738
00:25:04,540 --> 00:25:07,940
Mimi, you're enjoying Kyoto thoroughly.

739
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:09,040
But this is the beginner course.

740
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:10,807
- Is this the beginner course? / - Yes, it's level 1.

741
00:25:10,807 --> 00:25:12,407
Oh, that's right.

742
00:25:12,407 --> 00:25:14,940
- Whether you go to Kyoto... / - Or don't go to Kyoto...

743
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:17,640
If you'll regret it, go to Kyoto!

744
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:18,807
Good job.

745
00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:21,307
You'll seriously regret it if you don't go to Kyoto.

746
00:25:21,307 --> 00:25:23,107
You will.

747
00:25:23,107 --> 00:25:26,274
This is the riverside I really like.

748
00:25:26,274 --> 00:25:28,740
- Is this the street you like? / - Yes.

749
00:25:30,540 --> 00:25:32,240
- Like it? / - The view...

750
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:34,974
This is the perfect hour at this river.

751
00:25:34,974 --> 00:25:37,307
You can't see when it's too dark.

752
00:25:37,307 --> 00:25:39,474
This season is perfect.

753
00:25:39,474 --> 00:25:41,474
They open the terrace starting from May.

754
00:25:41,474 --> 00:25:43,774
- They open the terrace. / - You need to come here.

755
00:25:43,774 --> 00:25:45,840
You need to feel this.

756
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:48,874
I really wanted to go there.

757
00:25:48,874 --> 00:25:51,240
The plane time wasn't right.

758
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:54,207
That place is hard to go because of that.

759
00:25:54,207 --> 00:25:56,074
- That... / - We only ever walk there.

760
00:25:56,074 --> 00:25:58,040
- That river... / - If you walk down, it's amazing.

761
00:25:58,040 --> 00:26:01,207
Even the poet Yun Dongju walked along this river.

762
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:04,240
This place is really nice.

763
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:08,974
When I was leaving for work in the morning,

764
00:26:08,974 --> 00:26:11,407
I saw people jogging.

765
00:26:11,407 --> 00:26:13,440
It was outside my house.

766
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,440
I didn't sleep for two days.

767
00:26:17,374 --> 00:26:19,207
I thought, "How different can our lives be?"

768
00:26:19,207 --> 00:26:21,740
But we're the same right now.

769
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:25,274
I'm just happy that I'm part of this group.

770
00:26:25,274 --> 00:26:28,107
See as much as you can of this river at this time.

771
00:26:28,107 --> 00:26:30,040
I'm speechless.

772
00:26:30,774 --> 00:26:33,107
- I know what it feels like. / - Me too.

773
00:26:33,107 --> 00:26:35,107
It makes you choke up.

774
00:26:35,107 --> 00:26:38,640
Your happy hormones gush out.

775
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:41,040
I think Shinyoung might cry.

776
00:26:42,574 --> 00:26:46,240
I shouldn't be so moved like this on the first day.

777
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:48,307
Why is the beginner course so nice?

778
00:26:48,307 --> 00:26:51,607
I found a really trendy place.

779
00:26:51,607 --> 00:26:53,307
- Okay. Let's go. / - Let's go.

780
00:26:53,307 --> 00:26:54,707
- Let's go. / - Let's go.

781
00:26:54,707 --> 00:26:55,774
- Brush away the dirt. / - Let's go.

782
00:26:55,774 --> 00:26:57,507
- It's this way. / - Is it this way?

783
00:26:57,507 --> 00:27:01,140
- Don't pretend you know the way. / - Okay.

784
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:05,507
(Relaxing in the city beside Kamo River)

785
00:27:09,007 --> 00:27:11,207
- I think they walked 10,000 steps. / - That's amazing.

786
00:27:14,807 --> 00:27:16,974
- Oh! / - Isn't this incredible?

787
00:27:16,974 --> 00:27:20,307
- There's the moon over there. / - And look left.

788
00:27:20,307 --> 00:27:21,907
There's the Kyoto Tower.

789
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:24,674
It looks different at night.

790
00:27:28,374 --> 00:27:29,307
It's totally hip here.

791
00:27:29,307 --> 00:27:32,440
The owners made all this.

792
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:36,274
Students of the Kyoto University of Art and Design.

793
00:27:36,274 --> 00:27:37,840
They made all of this.

794
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:38,807
This place is really trendy.

795
00:27:38,807 --> 00:27:40,107
- Isn't it really trendy? / - It's so hip.

796
00:27:40,107 --> 00:27:42,274
- Doesn't it feel like Hongdae? / - Yes.

797
00:27:42,274 --> 00:27:44,674
- It's like Hongdae or Yeonnam. / - It feels young.

798
00:27:44,674 --> 00:27:46,807
There are a lot of things to eat.

799
00:27:46,807 --> 00:27:48,940
You can choose according to your preference.

800
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:50,907
- It feels young. / - Of course.

801
00:27:50,907 --> 00:27:53,740
There's a campfire there.

802
00:27:54,307 --> 00:27:55,740
This place is also different.

803
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:58,540
(You can roast marshmallows here)

804
00:27:59,274 --> 00:28:02,140
(What will they eat?)

805
00:28:03,774 --> 00:28:05,674
- Amazing. / - What is this?

806
00:28:05,674 --> 00:28:07,574
Grilled foods. Should we get one?

807
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:10,707
- Skewers! / - They were so good.

808
00:28:11,174 --> 00:28:12,940
(2 chicken skewers for $4.90)

809
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:16,340
- Should we try Kyoto beef? / - Yes, yes.

810
00:28:16,340 --> 00:28:17,307
Kyoto beef...

811
00:28:19,207 --> 00:28:20,874
This is it.

812
00:28:20,874 --> 00:28:23,374
- That was so good. / - Kyoto beef.

813
00:28:23,374 --> 00:28:25,040
- You must try it. / - Highly recommended.

814
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,540
Number one.

815
00:28:28,807 --> 00:28:30,040
Number one.

816
00:28:30,874 --> 00:28:33,007
Yakisoba.

817
00:28:33,774 --> 00:28:36,674
This feels like a pub at a university festival.

818
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:39,740
(They're done setting up)

819
00:28:40,407 --> 00:28:42,574
- Thank you. / - It was really good.

820
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:45,974
This is Kyoto beef.

821
00:28:45,974 --> 00:28:48,774
Thank you for the food.

822
00:28:48,774 --> 00:28:52,207
Let's have one each. One chicken a day.

823
00:28:52,207 --> 00:28:55,040
- One chicken a day. / - This is like a food show.

824
00:28:55,940 --> 00:28:58,474
- Wow. / - It's so good.

825
00:28:58,474 --> 00:29:00,140
It's really tender.

826
00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:03,274
- It looked dry but it's not. / - Not at all.

827
00:29:03,274 --> 00:29:05,307
It's not salty. I thought it would be

828
00:29:05,307 --> 00:29:06,307
but it's not salty at all.

829
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:08,374
Mmm.

830
00:29:09,374 --> 00:29:10,640
I can taste the charcoal.

831
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:13,807
It looks so good.

832
00:29:17,807 --> 00:29:18,940
(Frown)

833
00:29:19,774 --> 00:29:21,440
Hip!

834
00:29:22,807 --> 00:29:24,007
This was so good.

835
00:29:24,507 --> 00:29:26,574
You must eat this.

836
00:29:26,574 --> 00:29:28,007
- This... / - Kyoto beef.

837
00:29:29,674 --> 00:29:31,074
It's insane.

838
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:33,640
Why is it so tender?

839
00:29:38,207 --> 00:29:40,140
- My eyebrows are angry, right? / - Yeah.

840
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:41,274
Wow.

841
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:43,207
It tastes like milk.

842
00:29:43,207 --> 00:29:45,474
Really good beef tastes like milk.

843
00:29:45,474 --> 00:29:48,007
- Beef tastes like milk. / - It tastes like milk?

844
00:29:49,140 --> 00:29:52,307
(Special sauce with butter and garlic oil)

845
00:29:56,940 --> 00:29:58,907
(It's popular because they use high-quality beef)

846
00:29:58,907 --> 00:30:01,407
- Look at that meat. / - I want to eat it again.

847
00:30:01,407 --> 00:30:04,907
- Like they're frying the meat. / - That was so good.

848
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:13,574
- This is the best steak. / - The best?

849
00:30:13,574 --> 00:30:15,607
- It's so good. / - It's really good.

850
00:30:15,607 --> 00:30:17,540
You have to try this.

851
00:30:17,540 --> 00:30:18,974
It's so good.

852
00:30:19,874 --> 00:30:21,674
Try some. Eat up.

853
00:30:23,407 --> 00:30:24,707
This is amazing.

854
00:30:25,207 --> 00:30:27,307
This isn't like the one we ate in our room.

855
00:30:28,907 --> 00:30:30,107
- Here, cheers. / - Cheers.

856
00:30:34,507 --> 00:30:35,474
Wow.

857
00:30:38,974 --> 00:30:40,307
- It's spicy. / - It's different.

858
00:30:40,307 --> 00:30:42,507
- It's different to the ones I've had before. / - Right?

859
00:30:42,507 --> 00:30:46,440
- It's a fusion dish. / - A fusion dish.

860
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:49,007
Is this tripe?

861
00:30:49,007 --> 00:30:51,074
- Isn't it pork? / - No.

862
00:30:51,907 --> 00:30:55,074
- I think it's tripe. / - It's tripe. I'm sure.

863
00:30:55,074 --> 00:30:58,007
I'm sure of it. This is a Japanese style fried tripe.

864
00:30:58,807 --> 00:31:00,807
It's not like yakisoba.

865
00:31:00,807 --> 00:31:04,574
It is Japanese style fried tripe, with a spicy aftertaste.

866
00:31:04,574 --> 00:31:07,307
This would be a huge hit in Hongdae.

867
00:31:07,674 --> 00:31:11,040
(It's perfect for the taste of Koreans)

868
00:31:16,674 --> 00:31:18,740
- I'll eat the rest. / - Okay.

869
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:22,840
(Shinyoung eats so well)

870
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:26,207
We ate everything. It's so good.

871
00:31:26,207 --> 00:31:29,040
We're really picky.

872
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:31,774
You know how sensitive my tastes are.

873
00:31:31,774 --> 00:31:34,640
- Very sensitive. / - She's a gourmet.

874
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:37,874
You get tired of eating Japanese food after 2 days.

875
00:31:37,874 --> 00:31:40,340
You want to eat spicy food.

876
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:43,207
You should eat this. It's spicy in the end.

877
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:45,574
Let's go to the campfire.

878
00:31:45,574 --> 00:31:47,540
To be honest, I was jealous.

879
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:50,207
I want to roast marshmallows.

880
00:31:50,207 --> 00:31:52,007
- Like a hippie. / - Like hippies.

881
00:31:52,007 --> 00:31:55,040
You can roast marshmallows at the campfire.

882
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:57,507
- That's romantic. / - Yes, that's romantic.

883
00:31:57,507 --> 00:31:59,807
It's $5 for this box?

884
00:31:59,807 --> 00:32:02,540
- It's for the vibe. / - Yeah, don't save on food.

885
00:32:02,540 --> 00:32:03,507
That's right.

886
00:32:04,474 --> 00:32:07,640
This was my first time roasting marshmallows.

887
00:32:09,340 --> 00:32:10,840
It's so good.

888
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:12,140
- Isn't it good? / - Yes.

889
00:32:14,307 --> 00:32:16,574
This is so delicious.

890
00:32:16,974 --> 00:32:18,474
This tastes like toffee.

891
00:32:18,474 --> 00:32:21,440
It's like toffee and also choco pie.

892
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:24,207
- You're right. / - The marshmallow in the choco pie.

893
00:32:25,507 --> 00:32:27,340
(Yum)

894
00:32:28,107 --> 00:32:29,540
It felt so warm.

895
00:32:29,540 --> 00:32:31,840
I can't forget this day.

896
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:33,107
That looks so good.

897
00:32:36,340 --> 00:32:37,940
I love it.

898
00:32:37,940 --> 00:32:40,707
My legs are about to burst.

899
00:32:40,707 --> 00:32:42,240
It hurts but it feels good.

900
00:32:43,374 --> 00:32:44,340
Pervert.

901
00:32:45,074 --> 00:32:46,207
It hurts but feels good.

902
00:32:46,807 --> 00:32:49,074
It's been a while since I ate without stress.

903
00:32:49,074 --> 00:32:50,274
Right?

904
00:32:50,274 --> 00:32:54,340
Tomorrow, we'll make your fantasies come true.

905
00:32:54,340 --> 00:32:56,007
- My fantasies... / - Tomorrow is level 2.

906
00:32:57,874 --> 00:33:02,207
(The day of the intermediate course is dawning)

907
00:33:03,274 --> 00:33:05,007
This was amazing.

908
00:33:05,407 --> 00:33:06,874
What is that?

909
00:33:06,874 --> 00:33:08,207
This was amazing.

910
00:33:08,207 --> 00:33:11,074
- Bamboo forest. / - You have to walk hand in hand here.

911
00:33:13,874 --> 00:33:17,040
(Kyoto Station to Saga-Arashiyama Station, 15 mins)

912
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:20,674
I really wanted to come here. The best of nature.

913
00:33:20,674 --> 00:33:23,240
This is our intermediate course.

914
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:28,840
There are things that you may have seen on blogs.

915
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:30,207
And there are surprises.

916
00:33:30,207 --> 00:33:32,174
- There are also surprises? / - Of course.

917
00:33:32,174 --> 00:33:36,240
The place we're going... Kyoto nobility.

918
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:38,140
- Nobility? / - It was their holiday destination.

919
00:33:38,140 --> 00:33:41,174
They say to go to the bamboo forest early...

920
00:33:41,174 --> 00:33:45,040
- Because there are so many people. / - We're here.

921
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:47,440
This is the bamboo forest.

922
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:48,907
Why is it so pretty.

923
00:33:49,907 --> 00:33:51,340
Listen to the sounds.

924
00:33:51,340 --> 00:33:52,974
This is amazing.

925
00:33:52,974 --> 00:33:56,740
- It's like a scene from a commercial. / - It's so nice.

926
00:33:56,740 --> 00:33:59,140
- This is the intermediate course, right? / - Yeah.

927
00:33:59,140 --> 00:34:00,174
- Level 2. / - Yeah.

928
00:34:00,174 --> 00:34:03,407
When people come here, they all go left.

929
00:34:03,407 --> 00:34:04,974
- You're right. / - They go left.

930
00:34:04,974 --> 00:34:06,240
We'll go straight.

931
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:07,940
- This way? / - Yes.

932
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:10,507
When you go straight from the bamboo grove,

933
00:34:10,507 --> 00:34:12,740
you can take photos inside the bamboo grove.

934
00:34:12,740 --> 00:34:13,840
Not that many people go there.

935
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:16,240
I'll introduce you a completely secret photo zone.

936
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:17,440
- Okay, okay. / - Just go straight.

937
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:18,840
Follow me quietly.

938
00:34:20,740 --> 00:34:22,407
I love things like this.

939
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:24,707
It's so pretty.

940
00:34:24,707 --> 00:34:27,507
Album cover photos would be amazing here.

941
00:34:27,507 --> 00:34:29,440
- There's no one, right? / - Right.

942
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:31,507
It's really secluded.

943
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:34,507
- It's so pretty. / - Look at that.

944
00:34:37,074 --> 00:34:39,307
- This is it. / - Look up.

945
00:34:42,007 --> 00:34:43,140
It's so pretty.

946
00:34:43,574 --> 00:34:44,807
How can it be so nice?

947
00:34:46,007 --> 00:34:48,174
I don't believe this.

948
00:34:48,907 --> 00:34:51,574
Bamboo...

949
00:34:52,207 --> 00:34:54,940
I'm scared that I might forget this sight.

950
00:34:54,940 --> 00:34:57,274
- What? / - I'm scared I might forget this.

951
00:34:58,740 --> 00:34:59,974
It has a cool vibe.

952
00:34:59,974 --> 00:35:02,440
- You need to shoot a movie there. / - That's not CG?

953
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:04,140
Mimi's expression was beautiful.

954
00:35:04,140 --> 00:35:06,407
She's scared she might forget this sight.

955
00:35:06,407 --> 00:35:07,874
It's poetic.

956
00:35:08,774 --> 00:35:10,874
I want to remember this.

957
00:35:10,874 --> 00:35:12,840

958
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:15,440
- You must've really enjoyed it. / - It's beautiful.

959
00:35:17,140 --> 00:35:19,240
Just come here a bit early.

960
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:22,040
- Don't take photo with the crowd. / - Right.

961
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:25,674
You can enjoy the bamboos at ease.

962
00:35:25,674 --> 00:35:28,240
And take all the photos you want.

963
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:31,040
- You still won't come? / - You won't?

964
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:33,340
- Whether you go to Kyoto... / - Or don't go to Kyoto...

965
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:36,707
If you'll regret it, go to Kyoto!

966
00:35:36,707 --> 00:35:37,907
You must come here.

967
00:35:37,907 --> 00:35:40,374
- Even when you see this? / - You won't come?

968
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:45,040
(Second course of enjoying Arashiyama)

969
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:50,140
So cute.

970
00:35:50,140 --> 00:35:51,940
This is the start.

971
00:35:54,540 --> 00:35:56,507
Open car.

972
00:35:57,807 --> 00:35:59,507
There's Sagano Romantic Train.

973
00:35:59,507 --> 00:36:02,640
It costs $6.10 per person.

974
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:04,074
Let's check it out.

975
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:08,574

976
00:36:08,574 --> 00:36:10,207
- You took that? / - You can enjoy the view.

977
00:36:10,207 --> 00:36:12,940
Right and left view are different.

(It's an open roof)

979
00:36:17,407 --> 00:36:19,574
- It's all open. / - That's nice.

980
00:36:20,540 --> 00:36:24,007
(Here, the scenery looks nicer on the right)

981
00:36:24,007 --> 00:36:26,974
- Doesn't that mean "right?" / - Yes, right.

982
00:36:26,974 --> 00:36:28,774

Wow, it's so pretty.

986
00:36:36,207 --> 00:36:39,140
In autumn, you get foliage.

987
00:36:39,140 --> 00:36:43,307
(Romantic train in the autumn)

988
00:36:44,707 --> 00:36:47,207
We're going to Hogwarts. To Hogwarts.

989
00:36:47,907 --> 00:36:50,340
I feel like I'm transporting to a magical world.

990
00:36:51,407 --> 00:36:52,940
Here it comes. We need to film this.

991

(Screaming)

992
00:36:56,907 --> 00:36:58,674
It's so picturesque.

It's so cool.

994
00:37:02,740 --> 00:37:05,140

World champion?

1009
00:38:01,707 --> 00:38:03,107
Oh, Kim Yuna!

1010
00:38:05,674 --> 00:38:07,674

1022
00:38:39,774 --> 00:38:42,007
We can do a flower cookie class in Japan.

1023
00:38:42,007 --> 00:38:43,407
You know what that is, right?

1024
00:38:43,407 --> 00:38:44,974
They're shaped like flowers.

1025
00:38:44,974 --> 00:38:46,174
You don't know?

1026
00:38:46,174 --> 00:38:47,807
You've never seen them, right?

1027
00:38:47,807 --> 00:38:50,840
- Something like this. / - They look pretty.

1028
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:52,307
It'd be good to make...

00:38:52,307 --> 00:38:54,007
And give out to your members.

1030
00:38:54,007 --> 00:38:55,874

00:39:17,974 --> 00:39:21,007
Hello. Nice to meet you.

1043
00:39:21,207 --> 00:39:24,874
That master has been making sweets for 50 years.

1044
00:39:27,907 --> 00:39:30,074
He'll give us a brief explanation.

1045
00:39:30,074 --> 00:39:31,840
Everything is in Korean too.

1046
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:34,907

00:39:34,907 --> 00:39:37,974
- I'm good at assembling things. / - Right?

1048
00:39:37,974 --> 00:39:39,107
You're good at making stuff.

00:39:39,107 --> 00:39:42,307
I like crafting by nature.

1050
00:39:42,307 --> 00:39:43,974
You sound pretty confident.

1051
00:39:44,940 --> 00:39:46,540
(A red bean sweet made with sugar, flour, rice flour)

1052
00:39:46,540 --> 00:39:48,640
- Take one each. / - I see.

1055
00:39:52,574 --> 00:39:55,240
- Make it 4cm in diameter. / - Press it like this?

1056
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:56,674
Yes, press it like this.

1057
00:39:56,674 --> 00:39:58,507
- Like this? / - Yeah.

1058
00:40:00,074 --> 00:40:02,274
Put this in the groove.

Press it.

1060
00:40:04,274 --> 00:40:06,307
Put the white one in the center.

- In the center. / - Okay.

1062
00:40:08,374 --> 00:40:10,207
Flip it over.

(They slowly enter a difficult stage)

1064
00:40:14,374 --> 00:40:16,407
Turn it over.

1065
00:40:17,374 --> 00:40:20,174
(You have to turn it inside out)

1066
00:40:21,740 --> 00:40:22,774
Now, keep watching.

1067
00:40:22,774 --> 00:40:25,140
(She gives up on interpreting)

1068
00:40:27,974 --> 00:40:28,974
Interpret for me.

1069
00:40:29,274 --> 00:40:31,840
You can't just sit there doing your own thing.

1070
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:34,907
Why am I learning over your shoulders?

1071
00:40:35,207 --> 00:40:36,707
I'm sorry.

1072
00:40:36,707 --> 00:40:37,707
Do it like this.

1073
00:40:37,874 --> 00:40:41,140
- Interpret. Don't just do it alone. / - I was too focused.

1074
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:43,774
I understood it but I couldn't interpret right away.

1075
00:40:43,774 --> 00:40:45,507
- I had to make mine too. / - Over the shoulder...

1076
00:40:46,007 --> 00:40:48,207
(She learned faster by just watching Mimi)

1077
00:40:48,574 --> 00:40:51,340
Put it inside. Just like that. Yes, you're good.

1078
00:40:52,307 --> 00:40:54,040
- You're good. / - I think I'm getting close.

1079
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:55,540
She's good.

1080
00:40:55,540 --> 00:40:56,774
Show it to him.

1081
00:40:57,174 --> 00:40:58,440
Shinyoung is good at making that.

1082
00:40:58,440 --> 00:40:59,374
- Look at her fingertips. / - She was really good.

1083
00:40:59,374 --> 00:41:00,540
Her hands are cute.

1084
00:41:00,540 --> 00:41:02,407
(Mimi doesn't get what to do)

1085
00:41:03,374 --> 00:41:05,707
(Only hers is perfect)

1086
00:41:06,074 --> 00:41:08,440
When you turn it, use your thumb.

1087
00:41:10,074 --> 00:41:11,907
Look. Turn it like this.

1088
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:14,474
- She's a lady. / - She's so good. My gosh.

1089
00:41:14,474 --> 00:41:17,274
- She's good at that. / - How could she make that?

1090
00:41:17,274 --> 00:41:18,440
I'm good at making stuff.

1091
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:20,374
(Stamp the mold and it's done)

1092
00:41:20,907 --> 00:41:22,307
This is so cute.

1093
00:41:22,307 --> 00:41:23,740
- Your sweet looks so pretty. / - Now, we're done.

1094
00:41:23,740 --> 00:41:26,274
- Shinyoung's looks much better. / - That's right.

1095
00:41:26,274 --> 00:41:28,307
- My hands are rough. / - Shinyoung's sweet is pretty.

1096
00:41:29,874 --> 00:41:32,740
- He gave us tea too. / - That was really delicious.

1097
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:36,240
- My gosh, that tea. / - It smells really good.

1098
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:37,240
It's rich.

1099
00:41:37,740 --> 00:41:40,740
Given its bitterness, I would've spat it out.

1100
00:41:40,740 --> 00:41:42,007
- It'd go well with the sweets. / - But it's smooth.

1101
00:41:42,007 --> 00:41:43,707
- They'd taste good together. / - It must be sweet.

1102
00:41:43,707 --> 00:41:45,807
- It was good. It was really tasty. / - Right.

1103
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:50,274
- It's good. / - It's good.

1104
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:53,874
(A bite of sweetness and a sip of matcha tea)

1105
00:41:55,140 --> 00:41:56,174
They go well together.

1106
00:41:56,674 --> 00:41:58,940
Mimi is fluent in Japanese.

1107
00:41:59,307 --> 00:42:02,874
I don't speak Japanese but I can follow instructions.

1108
00:42:02,874 --> 00:42:06,340
The class costs $19.60 cents per person.

1109
00:42:06,340 --> 00:42:08,807
- The sweets are included too? / - That's reasonable.

1110
00:42:10,507 --> 00:42:11,774
He's showing them something.

1111
00:42:11,774 --> 00:42:14,207
- It's a technique. / - He showed us something else.

1112
00:42:14,207 --> 00:42:18,407
He showed it to us because Mimi worked so hard.

1113
00:42:18,407 --> 00:42:20,840
- Is that a Pokemon? / - He was excited.

1114
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:22,174
He can create whatever he wants.

1115
00:42:22,174 --> 00:42:24,407
- You can even make that. / - The maneki-neko!

1116
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:26,740
- It has paws too. / - Seriously.

1117
00:42:26,740 --> 00:42:28,507
- The cat waves its paws. / - That's right.

1118
00:42:28,507 --> 00:42:30,740
- The fortune cat. / - I know that cat.

1119
00:42:30,740 --> 00:42:33,374
- The one that says hello? / - Yes.

1120
00:42:33,374 --> 00:42:34,740
The cat that goes like this.

1121
00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:37,474
- We made the sweets, right? / - Yes.

1122
00:42:37,474 --> 00:42:40,840
The dinner will make you slap your knees.

1123
00:42:41,507 --> 00:42:44,174
You'll slap your knees out of amazement.

1124
00:42:44,174 --> 00:42:45,240
We just took a class to make the sweets.

1125
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:46,474
- Yes, we did. / - This is the next place!

1126
00:42:46,474 --> 00:42:48,440
They're going there at last.

1127
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:50,107
Can I share this with you now?

1128
00:42:50,974 --> 00:42:52,374
It's been running for 140 years.

1129
00:42:53,074 --> 00:42:55,007
- The restaurant? / - Yes.

1130
00:42:56,274 --> 00:42:57,974
This is a sukiyaki restaurant.

1131
00:42:58,507 --> 00:43:01,874
- Sukiyaki? / - Yes. History.

1132
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:04,907
- It's 140 years old? / - On Teramachi Street...

1133
00:43:04,907 --> 00:43:07,807
This is the only original building.

1134
00:43:08,174 --> 00:43:10,907
- This is amazing. / - This is the butcher shop.

1135
00:43:10,907 --> 00:43:12,474
- This is the butcher shop? / - Yes.

1136
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:15,507
This is the butcher shop and a restaurant is upstairs.

1137
00:43:15,507 --> 00:43:17,474
- We can trust the meat quality. / - We can?

1138
00:43:17,474 --> 00:43:20,107
- We'll have the sukiyaki meal. / - The sukiyaki meal.

1139
00:43:20,107 --> 00:43:21,040
$150?

1140
00:43:21,274 --> 00:43:23,374
- It does look delicious. / - That tasted amazing.

1141
00:43:23,374 --> 00:43:24,807
- It's quite pricey but... / - Wow.

1142
00:43:24,807 --> 00:43:26,407
If we're going to have sukiyaki,

1143
00:43:26,407 --> 00:43:30,007
we should have the best sukiyaki from this region.

1144
00:43:30,007 --> 00:43:31,240
Would you look at that.

1145
00:43:31,240 --> 00:43:33,674
- It's worth the expense. / - It really is.

1146
00:43:33,674 --> 00:43:34,540
It has a rich flavor.

1147
00:43:34,540 --> 00:43:36,440
- Level three. / - Three.

1148
00:43:36,440 --> 00:43:37,507
Three.

1149
00:43:38,507 --> 00:43:40,474
(The sukiyaki makes her eyebrows squirm)

1150
00:43:40,474 --> 00:43:42,807
(They learn how delicious sukiyaki is)

1151
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:46,940
- Hello. / - Hello.

1152
00:43:47,940 --> 00:43:50,707
Look at this. Do you see the street?

1153
00:43:50,707 --> 00:43:52,974
It's Teramachi Street.

1154
00:43:53,340 --> 00:43:55,574
That's this street 140 years ago.

1155
00:43:55,574 --> 00:43:57,774
- The building's the same? / - Exactly the same.

1156
00:43:58,774 --> 00:44:01,707
It's amazing that a restaurant is

1157
00:44:01,707 --> 00:44:03,207
more than 100 years old.

1158
00:44:03,507 --> 00:44:06,807
Look at this. They painted the staircase over and over.

1159
00:44:06,807 --> 00:44:08,140
But you can see the traces of time on it.

1160
00:44:09,407 --> 00:44:10,507
- It's amazing. / - This is amazing.

1161
00:44:11,140 --> 00:44:16,807
This is a typical traditional Japanese tatami room.

1162
00:44:16,807 --> 00:44:20,274
- You can hear the water flowing. / - I hear water.

1163
00:44:20,274 --> 00:44:22,607
That place tastes good before you even try the food.

1164
00:44:22,607 --> 00:44:25,474
What do you think of when you think of sukiyaki?

1165
00:44:25,474 --> 00:44:28,340
- I have never tried it yet. / - Really?

1166
00:44:28,340 --> 00:44:32,507
The most popular form of sukiyaki is from Kanto.

1167
00:44:32,507 --> 00:44:35,174
You eat it boiled or steamed.

1168
00:44:35,174 --> 00:44:37,607
The one we most commonly eat is the Kanto style.

1169
00:44:37,607 --> 00:44:40,007
- Here, it's the Kansai style. / - Kansai?

1170
00:44:40,007 --> 00:44:41,740
They grill it, which is the Kansai style.

1171
00:44:41,740 --> 00:44:44,007
It's different. They eat it in different ways.

1172
00:44:44,007 --> 00:44:45,407
- It is? / - Yes.

1173
00:44:45,407 --> 00:44:47,474
- Here we go. / - It's so...

1174
00:44:48,340 --> 00:44:49,940
It seems so traditional.

1175
00:44:49,940 --> 00:44:51,740
- It's cute. / - I can't wait to see it.

1176
00:44:52,074 --> 00:44:55,274
I wanted to treat her a proper meal at least once...

1177
00:44:56,174 --> 00:44:58,240
In a great restaurant.

1178
00:44:58,240 --> 00:45:00,574
- Despite the costs. / - Right. Just for me.

1179
00:45:00,574 --> 00:45:03,807
She's breaking the egg...

1180
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:07,674
One each. She's removing all the unsightly parts.

1181
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:10,874
The meat!

1182
00:45:10,874 --> 00:45:11,874
Unbelievable!

1183
00:45:11,874 --> 00:45:14,640
(Today's menu, beef appears)

1184
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:15,840
This is awesome.

1185
00:45:16,307 --> 00:45:18,740
- This is awesome. / - Hey, this looks like some...

1186
00:45:20,407 --> 00:45:22,740
- It looks so good. / - That meat...

1187
00:45:22,740 --> 00:45:26,340
They get the best parts from various regions each day.

1188
00:45:28,907 --> 00:45:33,540
Look. Kanto-style sukiyaki is served in a saucepan.

1189
00:45:33,540 --> 00:45:34,940
It looks like a pan for okonomiyaki.

1190
00:45:34,940 --> 00:45:36,807
Wow.

1191
00:45:37,540 --> 00:45:39,540
I can't help getting impressed by every single thing.

1192
00:45:39,974 --> 00:45:41,574
That's a bit embarrassing.

1193
00:45:41,574 --> 00:45:42,740
Okay.

1194
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:46,007
(So this is how you look unclassy and embarrassing)

1195
00:45:47,874 --> 00:45:49,107
You should be like this.

1196
00:45:49,407 --> 00:45:51,774
Try to look cool with it. Your face tells you're excited.

1197
00:45:51,774 --> 00:45:54,440
- Does it? / - You look so excited.

1198
00:45:54,440 --> 00:45:56,240
It's so obvious.

1199
00:45:58,074 --> 00:46:00,007
(Finally, the iron plate gets heated)

1200
00:46:00,007 --> 00:46:02,140
This is insane.

1201
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:06,307
This is how they cook in Kansai.

1202
00:46:06,440 --> 00:46:08,040
They do that in Kansai.

1203
00:46:08,040 --> 00:46:10,174
- They add sugar? / - It coats the meat.

1204
00:46:10,174 --> 00:46:11,440
They melt the sugar!

1205
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:13,274
That makes it really delicious.

1206
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:15,407
It sounds like rain.

1207
00:46:18,374 --> 00:46:20,740
- This is the same from the mangas. / - That's right.

1208
00:46:20,740 --> 00:46:22,440
You hear this in manga.

1209
00:46:24,507 --> 00:46:25,607
Oh, I hear the rain!

1210
00:46:25,707 --> 00:46:27,074
(A sudden shower on a hot day)

1211
00:46:27,407 --> 00:46:30,240
- Oh, I hear the rain! / - We both love animations.

1212
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:32,240
Then you see the lightning.

1213
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:33,740
It's cooking so well.

1214
00:46:34,540 --> 00:46:37,974
(The sizzling sound comforts you)

1215
00:46:39,807 --> 00:46:41,240
(Mimi is surprised again)

1216
00:46:42,207 --> 00:46:43,607
What is this sauce?

1217
00:46:43,607 --> 00:46:45,340
- It's soy sauce. / - They pour it on the meat.

1218
00:46:45,340 --> 00:46:47,007
(I want to eat that)

1219
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:49,774
I asked what kind of sauce it was

1220
00:46:49,774 --> 00:46:51,140
and she doesn't know because the owner made it.

1221
00:46:51,140 --> 00:46:52,907
Of course. It's the secret sauce.

1222
00:46:52,907 --> 00:46:54,774
- Passed on for generations. / - It's their secret.

1223
00:46:55,074 --> 00:46:56,907
Telling us to do this?

1224
00:46:58,340 --> 00:47:00,374
- Like this? / - Yeah.

1225
00:47:00,707 --> 00:47:02,407
I'd like it to be well-mixed.

1226
00:47:03,507 --> 00:47:04,974
I like it half-mixed.

1227
00:47:06,674 --> 00:47:09,574
Gosh, it looks so glossy.

1228
00:47:10,507 --> 00:47:13,774
(Sugar and soy sauce add gloss to the meat)

1229
00:47:13,774 --> 00:47:14,707
Can we eat it just like this?

1230
00:47:14,707 --> 00:47:17,307
- Do you dip it? / - This is the Kansai...

1231
00:47:17,307 --> 00:47:18,340
Oh, my goodness!

1232
00:47:18,340 --> 00:47:20,874
We're going to eat it now!

1233
00:47:22,307 --> 00:47:23,274
Rinse out my mouth.

1234
00:47:24,107 --> 00:47:25,474
- Thank you for the food. / - Thank you.

1235
00:47:26,174 --> 00:47:27,374
Let me try it.

1236
00:47:28,374 --> 00:47:29,774
Isn't the meat tough?

1237
00:47:29,974 --> 00:47:32,007
- It has to melt. / - Of course it's not tough.

1238
00:47:32,407 --> 00:47:33,807
It's not tough.

1239
00:47:33,807 --> 00:47:35,707
If you say it's tough, you're lying.

1240
00:47:35,707 --> 00:47:37,640
- Really? / - Of course.

1241
00:47:38,340 --> 00:47:39,940
(She dips the meat in the egg wash)

1242
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:42,440
What will we do about this?

1243
00:47:46,374 --> 00:47:47,740
(I can't help laughing)

1244
00:47:48,307 --> 00:47:49,274
Excuse me.

1245
00:47:49,307 --> 00:47:51,207
She's so happy.

1246
00:47:51,407 --> 00:47:53,807
- It's instinctive for me. / - This is incredible.

1247
00:47:54,740 --> 00:47:56,674
(She finally tastes it)

1248
00:47:57,174 --> 00:47:58,474
(They're reminded of how it was)

1249
00:47:58,474 --> 00:48:00,174
You're going to eat it in a single bite?

1250
00:48:00,174 --> 00:48:01,540
You need to eat that in big bites.

1251
00:48:03,107 --> 00:48:05,740
(She finally gets to taste it)

1252
00:48:07,540 --> 00:48:09,774
(They take the very first bite of traditional sukiyaki)

1253
00:48:13,340 --> 00:48:14,940
Amazing. It just hit her.

1254
00:48:15,607 --> 00:48:17,640
- There you go. / - There it is.

1255
00:48:19,007 --> 00:48:20,207
(It's amazing)

1256
00:48:20,207 --> 00:48:21,240
It must be so good.

1257
00:48:21,240 --> 00:48:22,974
I see "delicious" all over the screen.

1258
00:48:23,874 --> 00:48:26,007
- All over the screen... / - Wow...

1259
00:48:26,007 --> 00:48:28,074
This is so good.

1260
00:48:28,074 --> 00:48:30,207
What will I do when my first sukiyaki is this good?

1261
00:48:30,507 --> 00:48:33,574
This is how you become a terribly picky eater.

1262
00:48:33,574 --> 00:48:34,607
"This isn't right."

1263
00:48:34,607 --> 00:48:36,474
"This isn't how it's supposed to taste."

1264
00:48:36,474 --> 00:48:38,440
She added the sugar...

1265
00:48:38,440 --> 00:48:39,374
What about the sugar?

1266
00:48:39,374 --> 00:48:41,307
I've never seen sugar used like that before.

1267
00:48:41,307 --> 00:48:44,007
If you taste the sugar, it's not that sweet.

1268
00:48:44,007 --> 00:48:44,907
- It's not sweet? / - It's less sweet.

1269
00:48:44,907 --> 00:48:47,307
- Not too sweet. / - It's like a coating.

1270
00:48:47,307 --> 00:48:48,707
It's a flavor enhancer.

1271
00:48:48,707 --> 00:48:50,340
It's not that strongly seasoned.

1272
00:48:50,707 --> 00:48:52,374
(She pours some soy sauce on the iron plate again)

1273
00:48:54,540 --> 00:48:55,974
It's time to cook vegetables.

1274
00:48:55,974 --> 00:48:57,740
- They grill it? / - Yes.

1275
00:48:57,740 --> 00:48:59,474
Kyoto is well-known for good vegetables.

1276
00:48:59,474 --> 00:49:01,440
- She sprinkled the sugar again. / - She did.

1277
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:02,240
So pretty.

1278
00:49:03,640 --> 00:49:07,374
She keeps adding the sugar.

1279
00:49:07,774 --> 00:49:09,740
(Now the soy sauce)

1280
00:49:11,507 --> 00:49:13,240
Do we dip it all in the egg wash?

1281
00:49:14,340 --> 00:49:16,407
- Do it as you like. / - This is amazing.

1282
00:49:17,874 --> 00:49:19,174
(She dips it in the egg wash)

1283
00:49:19,174 --> 00:49:20,507
This is just so...

1284
00:49:24,774 --> 00:49:25,807
This is amazing.

1285
00:49:26,307 --> 00:49:27,707
(This is it!)

1286
00:49:27,707 --> 00:49:28,874
(Deliciousness)

1287
00:49:29,907 --> 00:49:32,807
(They're surrounded by deliciousness)

1288
00:49:33,340 --> 00:49:34,640
(Shiitake mushroom)

1289
00:49:37,174 --> 00:49:38,174
It tastes like meat.

1290
00:49:38,840 --> 00:49:39,940
(What?)

1291
00:49:40,674 --> 00:49:41,740
Am I wrong?

1292
00:49:42,040 --> 00:49:43,374
- You're right. / - Right?

1293
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:45,207
The texture is...

1294
00:49:45,574 --> 00:49:48,274
I don't like tofu so much.

1295
00:49:48,274 --> 00:49:49,407
Me neither.

1296
00:49:51,374 --> 00:49:52,540
(Amazed)

1297
00:49:54,407 --> 00:49:55,974
This is not tofu.

1298
00:49:55,974 --> 00:49:57,140
(No, no)

1299
00:49:57,140 --> 00:49:58,174
It's so delicious.

1300
00:49:58,174 --> 00:50:00,274
(Flavors enhanced by the sugar and soy sauce)

1301
00:50:00,540 --> 00:50:03,040
(She keeps eating the vegetables)

1302
00:50:03,807 --> 00:50:05,107
Why are you eating so much onion?

1303
00:50:05,107 --> 00:50:08,340
I don't know. When my mom sees this,

1304
00:50:08,340 --> 00:50:10,874
she'll be shocked that her daughter eats onions.

1305
00:50:10,874 --> 00:50:13,274
- Exactly. / - And I eat green onions.

1306
00:50:13,907 --> 00:50:16,140
I'm eating it like it's meat.

1307
00:50:18,107 --> 00:50:21,174
To be honest, I can eat 3 bowls of rice with this.

1308
00:50:24,507 --> 00:50:26,607
It'd be so good with rice.

1309
00:50:26,607 --> 00:50:29,540
- I want to eat rice with this. / - Here comes the rice.

1310
00:50:29,540 --> 00:50:32,007
- The rice here is so delicious. / - In Japan...

1311
00:50:32,907 --> 00:50:34,874
(The meat is ready as well)

1312
00:50:35,474 --> 00:50:36,640
- Thank you for the food. / - Dig in.

1313
00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:38,140
That's right, the egg at the end...

1314
00:50:38,374 --> 00:50:40,907
You add the egg with sauce on your rice...

1315
00:50:40,907 --> 00:50:42,907
- Eat it together. / - You have to eat it up.

1316
00:50:42,907 --> 00:50:45,307
- That's it. Way to go. / - Just like that.

1317
00:50:45,307 --> 00:50:47,207
Put white rice in your body.

1318
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:49,107
(There you go!)

1319
00:50:49,340 --> 00:50:52,174
- That's how you gain weight. Yes! / - Well done!

1320
00:50:52,174 --> 00:50:53,374
Great job!

1321
00:50:53,840 --> 00:50:54,974
Amazing.

1322
00:50:54,974 --> 00:50:58,340
Why do we always eat rice after eating meat?

1323
00:50:59,540 --> 00:51:02,074
(Perfect combo of meat and rice)

1324
00:51:02,074 --> 00:51:04,207
- It looks so delicious. / - I want to eat it like that too.

1325
00:51:04,207 --> 00:51:06,540
(This is what I wanted!)

1326
00:51:06,740 --> 00:51:07,840
I wonder how it'd taste.

1327
00:51:08,840 --> 00:51:10,740
- Ah, it's the next course. / - Oh, it's not over yet.

1328
00:51:10,740 --> 00:51:12,574
Because this is a course meal...

1329
00:51:12,574 --> 00:51:15,140
- She grills the food slowly. / - Cooked nice and slow.

1330
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:17,940
(A big bite)

1331
00:51:20,907 --> 00:51:22,140
- Dig in. / - That was so good.

1332
00:51:22,140 --> 00:51:25,240
- Eat it now? / - You have to eat it now.

1333
00:51:25,940 --> 00:51:27,707
(Once it gets cold, it won't taste the same)

1334
00:51:28,940 --> 00:51:30,607
(They're both impressed)

1335
00:51:30,807 --> 00:51:31,974
Deliciousness.

1336
00:51:32,407 --> 00:51:34,107
It's floating around the room.

1337
00:51:34,407 --> 00:51:35,440
That was the best.

1338
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:37,807
This is the best sukiyaki I've ever had in Japan.

1339
00:51:37,807 --> 00:51:39,907
- Is this the best? / - Yes, this is the best.

1340
00:51:39,907 --> 00:51:41,240
- Mimi. / - Yes.

1341
00:51:41,240 --> 00:51:43,607
Would you order one more bowl of rice for me?

1342
00:51:45,107 --> 00:51:47,307
The servings are small despite the great taste.

1343
00:51:47,307 --> 00:51:48,507
Then I don't have to save the rice.

1344
00:51:48,507 --> 00:51:50,407
You need two bowls of rice.

1345
00:51:50,407 --> 00:51:53,074
- You must eat two bowls of rice. / - Of course.

1346
00:51:53,074 --> 00:51:55,274
- Are you done with your rice? / - You can have it.

1347
00:51:55,274 --> 00:51:57,107
I ordered another as well.

1348
00:51:57,674 --> 00:51:59,507
- You ordered one too? / - Yes, I did.

1349
00:52:00,140 --> 00:52:01,940
(Mimi's stomach has become bigger now)

1350
00:52:02,440 --> 00:52:04,740
(Mimi ordered two bowls of rice)

1351
00:52:05,607 --> 00:52:07,840
She doesn't leave a single grain of rice.

1352
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:12,540
(They give the clean bowls back to her)

1353
00:52:13,374 --> 00:52:14,474
(They welcome new bowls of rice)

1354
00:52:14,474 --> 00:52:16,107
Welcoming the new bowl of rice.

1355
00:52:16,207 --> 00:52:17,674
Is this the last bite?

1356
00:52:19,474 --> 00:52:20,840
What a shame.

1357
00:52:20,840 --> 00:52:22,307
- I can imagine. / - Check that out.

1358
00:52:25,807 --> 00:52:28,340
(I will enjoy to the very last piece of meat)

1359
00:52:33,374 --> 00:52:35,774
(She savors the flavor for a long time)

1360
00:52:35,774 --> 00:52:37,407
My mouth is watering.

1361
00:52:37,974 --> 00:52:39,740
I have a huge mouth cavity.

1362
00:52:40,174 --> 00:52:42,640
- Minkyoung... / - Minkyoung, you can't leave.

1363
00:52:42,640 --> 00:52:44,340
- Grab her. / - No, no.

1364
00:52:44,340 --> 00:52:45,840
- That's a television screen. / - No, no.

1365
00:52:45,840 --> 00:52:47,540
- That's just a screen. / - Is it?

1366
00:52:47,540 --> 00:52:49,174
- Is it just a screen? / - It's just a screen.

1367
00:52:49,174 --> 00:52:50,874
- My goodness. / - This won't do.

1368
00:52:52,507 --> 00:52:54,807
Now you must know why I spent money on this.

1369
00:52:56,574 --> 00:52:58,474
(Shinyoung's love spreads in her mouth)

1370
00:53:02,740 --> 00:53:05,474
- Could you pour it here? / - Now?

1371
00:53:05,474 --> 00:53:06,740
That's amazing.

1372
00:53:06,740 --> 00:53:08,140
I know what that is.

1373
00:53:08,440 --> 00:53:10,607
- It's ochazuke. / - That's delicious.

1374
00:53:10,607 --> 00:53:12,107
- It's good like that. / - No more meat.

1375
00:53:12,407 --> 00:53:14,440
We finished the meat. We have pickled radish left.

1376
00:53:14,674 --> 00:53:17,607
- It was so delicious. / - This meal is worth $150.

1377
00:53:17,607 --> 00:53:19,574
She keeps lifting her arms.

1378
00:53:19,574 --> 00:53:22,607
Everyone, $150 dollars is so worth it.

1379
00:53:24,574 --> 00:53:25,774
I'm finished.

1380
00:53:26,174 --> 00:53:30,640
That was one of the top 3 meals of my life.

1381
00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:33,007
- It was really delicious. / - It was that good?

1382
00:53:33,007 --> 00:53:34,974
It was to die for.

1383
00:53:35,674 --> 00:53:37,140
I had two bowls of rice.

1384
00:53:37,140 --> 00:53:39,174
I've never had two bowls of rice before.

1385
00:53:39,640 --> 00:53:42,040
My eyebrows tell the truth.

1386
00:53:42,340 --> 00:53:43,940
They frown like this.

1387
00:53:44,274 --> 00:53:45,474
They tell the truth.

1388
00:53:45,474 --> 00:53:47,774
If I ever find myself in Kyoto, I'll definitely go again.

1389
00:53:49,040 --> 00:53:50,574
This is our second day.

1390
00:53:50,574 --> 00:53:51,807
What are we going to do tomorrow?

1391
00:53:52,174 --> 00:53:54,674
- Can I look forward to it? / - I'll fulfill all your dreams.

1392
00:53:54,674 --> 00:53:55,840
- My dreams? / - Yes.

1393
00:53:56,340 --> 00:53:58,474
An unbelievable itinerary that will

1394
00:53:58,474 --> 00:53:59,907
fulfill all of your dreams.

1395
00:54:00,874 --> 00:54:03,340
- It was so good. / - This is our last itinerary.

1396
00:54:03,807 --> 00:54:04,940
It's the advanced course.

1397
00:54:04,940 --> 00:54:06,540
I loved it there.

1398
00:54:06,540 --> 00:54:09,540
I don't think a lot of people know this destination.

1399
00:54:09,540 --> 00:54:10,774
Look at the color of the water.

1400
00:54:12,074 --> 00:54:14,740
- I love it here. / - Riding our bikes...

1401
00:54:15,207 --> 00:54:19,407
Today's itinerary is for the advanced level in Kyoto.

1402
00:54:20,107 --> 00:54:21,507
- It's the ultimatum. / - Okay.

1403
00:54:21,507 --> 00:54:23,174
- It's the last level. / - It's our last.

1404
00:54:23,340 --> 00:54:26,240
We can visit 2 places. We'll go to 2 places today.

1405
00:54:26,240 --> 00:54:28,340
As for the first destination,

1406
00:54:28,340 --> 00:54:29,807
not even the locals know about this.

1407
00:54:30,440 --> 00:54:33,774
- Have you heard of Amanohashidate? / - What?

1408
00:54:33,774 --> 00:54:35,774
- Amanohashidate. / - No, no.

1409
00:54:35,774 --> 00:54:36,940
- You've never heard of it, right? / - No.

1410
00:54:37,507 --> 00:54:39,740
I prepared my courses by stage.

1411
00:54:40,007 --> 00:54:42,207
You'll be surprised to find out about the last course.

1412
00:54:42,207 --> 00:54:44,340
That's what I intended our trip to be.

1413
00:54:44,340 --> 00:54:46,574
- Here's the scenic view. / - 1 of the 3 best views.

1414
00:54:46,840 --> 00:54:48,907
There are Japanese floating homes.

1415
00:54:48,907 --> 00:54:50,474
- Japan has floating homes? / - Yes, they do.

1416
00:54:50,907 --> 00:54:53,574
You need to go north from Kyoto

1417
00:54:53,574 --> 00:54:54,907
toward the East Sea of Korea.

1418
00:54:55,507 --> 00:54:57,707
We can take the train there.

1419
00:54:57,707 --> 00:54:59,874
We'll ride the express train.

1420
00:55:00,174 --> 00:55:01,774
- In Korean. / - Welcome.

1421
00:55:01,774 --> 00:55:04,074
(They buy the express train ticket to Amanohashidate)

1422
00:55:04,074 --> 00:55:05,140
Oh, "A."

1423
00:55:06,140 --> 00:55:07,240
Hashidate.

1424
00:55:08,174 --> 00:55:09,274
Okay.

1425
00:55:09,707 --> 00:55:11,074
I haven't been on a train in ages.

1426
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:12,640
- Really? / - Yeah.

1427
00:55:14,040 --> 00:55:15,774
- That's right. / - It takes about 2 hours.

1428
00:55:15,774 --> 00:55:17,840
When you're busy talking...

1429
00:55:17,840 --> 00:55:19,474
- Time flies. / - It goes by so fast.

1430
00:55:20,874 --> 00:55:22,974
- Welcome. / - The weather is amazing.

1431
00:55:22,974 --> 00:55:24,840
Amanohashidate.

1432
00:55:26,007 --> 00:55:27,240
Amanohashidate.

1433
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:29,407
- The weather's so nice. / - The weather was amazing.

1434
00:55:29,407 --> 00:55:31,107
The weather is excellent.

1435
00:55:31,107 --> 00:55:32,174
We're right here.

1436
00:55:34,274 --> 00:55:35,740
We're here.

1437
00:55:36,707 --> 00:55:38,774
- Let's go to View Land first. / - Okay.

1438
00:55:39,874 --> 00:55:41,640
Wait. That's how we're supposed to look.

1439
00:55:42,974 --> 00:55:44,540
- Must we look at it like that? / - Of course.

1440
00:55:44,540 --> 00:55:47,440
There's a view you must look upside down.

1441
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:48,574
Amanohashidate View Land.

1442
00:55:49,574 --> 00:55:51,340
(It's located at the top of the mountain)

1443
00:55:51,340 --> 00:55:52,507
You have to climb the mountain?

1444
00:55:53,340 --> 00:55:54,740
This place is...

1445
00:55:55,574 --> 00:55:58,140
On top, there's the monorail and below,

1446
00:55:58,140 --> 00:56:00,907
there's a one-person lift.

1447
00:56:00,907 --> 00:56:02,707
- Is that how you'll get there? / - Yes, that's right.

1448
00:56:02,707 --> 00:56:05,307
- That looks fun. / - That was fun. It was.

1449
00:56:05,307 --> 00:56:06,807
What do you mean it was fun?

1450
00:56:06,974 --> 00:56:08,774
You were like this the whole time.

1451
00:56:09,507 --> 00:56:10,707
You'll see that soon.

1452
00:56:11,340 --> 00:56:13,940
(They choose the one-person lift)

1453
00:56:13,940 --> 00:56:15,474
- There are so many people here. / - This is nice.

1454
00:56:15,474 --> 00:56:18,040
- That's how they ride it. / - It's $8.30 for entry.

1455
00:56:18,040 --> 00:56:19,274
You have to be careful.

1456
00:56:19,274 --> 00:56:21,540
This doesn't scare me. I'm not afraid of heights.

1457
00:56:22,207 --> 00:56:23,440
But you are, aren't you?

1458
00:56:24,374 --> 00:56:26,074
- No. / - Your face looks a bit stiff.

1459
00:56:26,074 --> 00:56:28,474
Your eyes tell me you're lying.

1460
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:31,474
It'd be great to travel up in the open air...

1461
00:56:31,474 --> 00:56:33,907
But there's no seatbelt.

1462
00:56:34,507 --> 00:56:36,074
(See? Aren't you scared?)

1463
00:56:36,807 --> 00:56:39,140
I'm not that scared of it. I was just joking.

1464
00:56:39,140 --> 00:56:40,674
But I think this is scaring you.

1465
00:56:41,507 --> 00:56:44,107
Even an old man is riding this.

1466
00:56:44,107 --> 00:56:46,507
- He rides it very comfortably. / - He seems relaxed.

1467
00:56:46,507 --> 00:56:48,074
Even little kids.

1468
00:56:48,774 --> 00:56:50,540
She just held the baby.

1469
00:56:51,140 --> 00:56:52,707
- I'm not scared. / - Sit on my lap.

1470
00:56:53,640 --> 00:56:54,840
Be careful. Watch out.

1471
00:56:54,940 --> 00:56:56,240
- She seems really nervous. / - She was so nervous.

1472
00:56:56,240 --> 00:56:57,940
She couldn't let go of the pole.

1473
00:56:57,940 --> 00:56:59,407
(Scared noises)

1474
00:57:01,274 --> 00:57:02,507
Shinyoung.

1475
00:57:02,774 --> 00:57:04,274
- You pretended to be unafraid. / - My goodness.

1476
00:57:05,540 --> 00:57:06,840
(She quickly grabs the pole)

1477
00:57:06,840 --> 00:57:08,207
It's high. It's high.

1478
00:57:10,140 --> 00:57:11,174
Wow.

1479
00:57:11,907 --> 00:57:13,074
She had so much fun.

1480
00:57:14,040 --> 00:57:15,174
- Shinyoung! / - My gosh.

1481
00:57:15,174 --> 00:57:16,907
- Shinyoung. / - Try to enjoy it.

1482
00:57:16,907 --> 00:57:18,740
- Why do you look so stiff? / - I was enjoying it.

1483
00:57:18,740 --> 00:57:20,007
Try to enjoy it.

1484
00:57:20,007 --> 00:57:21,240
(She's frozen)

1485
00:57:22,440 --> 00:57:24,407
- It's a still photo. / - She froze.

1486
00:57:24,407 --> 00:57:25,840
No. Right now, I'm so...

1487
00:57:26,574 --> 00:57:27,740
Comfortable...

1488
00:57:29,207 --> 00:57:31,407
(The lift is climbing up)

1489
00:57:31,407 --> 00:57:33,240
Mimi, doesn't the air smell nice?

1490
00:57:33,240 --> 00:57:34,574
Shinyoung, this is awesome.

1491
00:57:35,274 --> 00:57:36,474
Look behind me.

1492
00:57:37,307 --> 00:57:38,640
(A wonderful view as they climb up)

1493
00:57:38,640 --> 00:57:40,007
We're climbing up.

1494
00:57:42,674 --> 00:57:44,340
This is the best view.

1495
00:57:44,340 --> 00:57:45,474
Everyone must visit.

1496
00:57:46,774 --> 00:57:48,007
(You get to witness it on the way down)

1497
00:57:48,007 --> 00:57:49,340
That's the dragon... The dragon...

1498
00:57:49,340 --> 00:57:52,174
- Like a dragon's tail. / - You see that coming down.

1499
00:57:52,974 --> 00:57:54,507
- You did see the view, right? / - Yes, I saw it all.

1500
00:57:54,507 --> 00:57:56,807
Her hand has been in that one spot the whole ride.

1501
00:57:56,807 --> 00:57:58,207
It was the same when she came down.

1502
00:57:58,674 --> 00:58:01,207
(Hasn't moved an inch)

1503
00:58:01,207 --> 00:58:02,840
What are you mumbling about?

1504
00:58:02,840 --> 00:58:05,240
That's the quietest I've ever seen Shinyoung.

1505
00:58:05,240 --> 00:58:06,274
This is amazing.

1506
00:58:06,507 --> 00:58:07,740
I love it here.

1507
00:58:09,174 --> 00:58:11,074
- This place was so pretty. / - Amanohashidate.

1508
00:58:11,674 --> 00:58:13,574
One of the top 3 views.

1509
00:58:13,574 --> 00:58:14,874
- This view here? / - Right there.

1510
00:58:14,874 --> 00:58:16,040
Shaped like a dragon tail.

1511
00:58:17,140 --> 00:58:18,574
This looks like an amusement park.

1512
00:58:18,574 --> 00:58:20,840
- Everything looks pretty. / - It's a theme park for kids.

1513
00:58:20,840 --> 00:58:22,374
Don't look. Don't look yet.

1514
00:58:22,374 --> 00:58:24,074
- I shouldn't look now? / - Don't look yet.

1515
00:58:24,074 --> 00:58:25,540
- Don't look. Not just yet. / - Okay, okay.

1516
00:58:26,940 --> 00:58:29,374
- Don't look yet. / - It's like her boyfriend.

1517
00:58:29,374 --> 00:58:30,274
They look romantic.

1518
00:58:31,074 --> 00:58:33,107
"Don't look."

1519
00:58:33,107 --> 00:58:34,274
It's like a surprise.

1520
00:58:34,474 --> 00:58:35,607
Ta-da.

1521
00:58:36,607 --> 00:58:37,440
Ta-da.

1522
00:58:38,140 --> 00:58:38,874
The view!

1523
00:58:39,407 --> 00:58:42,740
(They can't believe their own eyes)

1524
00:58:42,974 --> 00:58:44,040
That's the pine forest?

1525
00:58:44,040 --> 00:58:46,507
- The whole path is the pine forest. / - Oh, my.

1526
00:58:46,507 --> 00:58:47,640
It's 1 of Japan's 3 best scenic views.

1527
00:58:47,640 --> 00:58:49,107
- One of the best... / - Yes.

1528
00:58:49,674 --> 00:58:51,940
- This is insane. / - This is amazing.

1529
00:58:52,807 --> 00:58:54,074
Isn't this incredible?

1530
00:58:56,607 --> 00:58:57,574
This is amazing.

1531
00:58:57,574 --> 00:59:00,140
You can see the sand through the clear water.

1532
00:59:00,740 --> 00:59:03,907
Where do we look upside down?

1533
00:59:04,374 --> 00:59:07,740
- She'll take photos for us. / - Really?

1534
00:59:07,740 --> 00:59:09,274
Hey, let's print our photo.

1535
00:59:10,707 --> 00:59:14,207
(She takes the photo with a camera)

1536
00:59:14,207 --> 00:59:16,007
(And they can print the photo on the spot)

1537
00:59:16,207 --> 00:59:17,807
- This is our photo. / - It's on the spot.

1538
00:59:17,807 --> 00:59:19,940
- I still have it. I'm so happy. / - It's me.

1539
00:59:19,940 --> 00:59:21,407
You can't miss out on that.

1540
00:59:24,040 --> 00:59:26,074
- This will last forever. / - Right.

1541
00:59:26,074 --> 00:59:27,274
Hey, let's try this too.

1542
00:59:28,174 --> 00:59:29,874
- Looking upside down? / - Let's go for it.

1543
00:59:30,374 --> 00:59:32,440
There's a specific spot where you look upside down.

1544
00:59:32,440 --> 00:59:34,907
What's that? You look like that?

1545
00:59:36,407 --> 00:59:37,507
This is it, right?

1546
00:59:39,474 --> 00:59:41,074
Wow, it looks different.

1547
00:59:41,640 --> 00:59:43,540
- It looks different. / - How does it look?

1548
00:59:43,840 --> 00:59:46,807
- The view is different. / - You see the tail the other way.

1549
00:59:47,940 --> 00:59:49,874
- It's different? / - Yes, it's different.

1550
00:59:49,874 --> 00:59:51,707
1, 2, 3.

1551
00:59:51,707 --> 00:59:55,540
(They try it together this time)

1552
00:59:57,674 --> 00:59:58,740
It looks different.

1553
00:59:59,140 --> 01:00:01,540
You should look at it upside down now.

1554
01:00:04,407 --> 01:00:05,907
It looks like it's coming towards you.

1555
01:00:05,907 --> 01:00:07,374
Oh, like this.

1556
01:00:07,374 --> 01:00:09,974
- A dragon... / - It's like the head of the dragon now.

1557
01:00:12,607 --> 01:00:14,874
We should buy some souvenirs.

1558
01:00:15,874 --> 01:00:17,374
They sell postcards.

1559
01:00:19,640 --> 01:00:20,774
A snowy day.

1560
01:00:21,074 --> 01:00:22,540
It looks like this on a snowy day.

1561
01:00:22,607 --> 01:00:24,340
They have different seasons.

1562
01:00:24,340 --> 01:00:28,774
- It was formed 8,000 years ago. / - Winter looks nice.

1563
01:00:28,774 --> 01:00:29,640
Winter is really pretty.

1564
01:00:30,307 --> 01:00:32,707
- Are you buying another key chain? / - Yes.

1565
01:00:34,007 --> 01:00:36,107
- My keychains. / - What is this?

1566
01:00:37,107 --> 01:00:38,340
(My goodness, Shinyoung)

1567
01:00:39,340 --> 01:00:41,074
- You have too many. / - You collect those.

1568
01:00:41,074 --> 01:00:43,507
I always buy anything that begins with, "I Love."

1569
01:00:43,774 --> 01:00:45,807
You have to buy these. These will last forever.

1570
01:00:45,807 --> 01:00:47,240
Nothing will last from your trip but souvenirs.

1571
01:00:47,474 --> 01:00:49,374
You buy it if it has "I Love?"

1572
01:00:49,374 --> 01:00:50,374
No matter what.

1573
01:00:50,574 --> 01:00:51,940
"I Love Vietnam," I buy it.

1574
01:00:52,374 --> 01:00:53,674
"I Love Singapore." Mine.

1575
01:00:54,940 --> 01:00:57,407
I should buy one for Jiho.

1576
01:00:58,007 --> 01:00:59,207
Why are you buying so many?

1577
01:00:59,640 --> 01:01:00,874
Only souvenirs last from trips.

1578
01:01:00,874 --> 01:01:02,574
What's this? A postcard for each season?

1579
01:01:03,307 --> 01:01:04,574
(She's sweeping the shelf)

1580
01:01:04,574 --> 01:01:05,840
You're going to empty this place.

1581
01:01:06,374 --> 01:01:07,874
Shinyoung is shopping here.

1582
01:01:08,940 --> 01:01:10,474
She's spending too much money.

1583
01:01:11,474 --> 01:01:13,140
I don't buy a lot of souvenirs.

1584
01:01:13,740 --> 01:01:15,574
But Shinyoung...

1585
01:01:15,574 --> 01:01:18,407
She seriously bought every kind of souvenir.

1586
01:01:18,407 --> 01:01:19,740
It's the same for every trip.

1587
01:01:19,874 --> 01:01:22,407
Money can burn since it's paper.

1588
01:01:22,407 --> 01:01:24,274
But memories can't burn.

1589
01:01:24,274 --> 01:01:26,240
So I never save money on trips.

1590
01:01:26,674 --> 01:01:29,407
I think that's great. Shinyoung told me

1591
01:01:29,407 --> 01:01:32,074
she buys the souvenirs because the memories

1592
01:01:32,074 --> 01:01:33,774
she has with the souvenirs are important to her.

1593
01:01:33,774 --> 01:01:35,440
I could relate to what she said.

1594
01:01:35,440 --> 01:01:37,674
So I realized that if I ever go on trips,

1595
01:01:37,674 --> 01:01:41,307
I should buy the souvenirs from that region.

1596
01:01:42,674 --> 01:01:45,040
This place... The way up and

1597
01:01:45,040 --> 01:01:46,507
the view from up here...

1598
01:01:46,507 --> 01:01:48,140
Make this a must-visit location.

1599
01:01:48,140 --> 01:01:50,107
- Isn't it the best? / - Everyone should come here.

1600
01:01:50,107 --> 01:01:51,374
Best destination for our last day.

1601
01:01:51,374 --> 01:01:53,240
However, I have another great spot.

1602
01:01:53,240 --> 01:01:53,974
You have another one?

1603
01:01:53,974 --> 01:01:55,507
- You have more? / - Of course.

1604
01:01:55,507 --> 01:01:56,940
That has to be the best spot.

1605
01:01:56,940 --> 01:01:59,140
It's a Japanese version of Hallstatt.

1606
01:01:59,140 --> 01:02:01,540
- Hallstatt in Austria? / - The floating village.

1607
01:02:02,140 --> 01:02:05,607
(Like the fairytale-like, floating village in Austria)

1608
01:02:07,340 --> 01:02:08,840
(Where is the Japanese Hallstatt?)

1609
01:02:08,840 --> 01:02:10,974
- Is that really in Japan? / - That's in Japan.

1610
01:02:10,974 --> 01:02:12,774
That's in Japan.

1611
01:02:12,774 --> 01:02:16,274
You can say that they're floating homes in Japan.

1612
01:02:16,274 --> 01:02:18,674
We go back to the station and take the bus,

1613
01:02:18,674 --> 01:02:20,040
and travel for around an hour.

1614
01:02:20,040 --> 01:02:21,240
- An hour? / - Yes.

1615
01:02:22,107 --> 01:02:24,607
- We took the bus. / - Bus? That's great.

1616
01:02:25,007 --> 01:02:28,440
(59 minutes from Amanohashidate to Ine Village)

1617
01:02:28,440 --> 01:02:33,107
This is Ine no Funaya Houses.

1618
01:02:33,540 --> 01:02:37,540
This village is originally called Ine.

1619
01:02:37,540 --> 01:02:40,274
The area with the floating houses is called Funaya.

1620
01:02:40,274 --> 01:02:42,507
But tourists just call the entire place

1621
01:02:42,507 --> 01:02:44,240
Ine no Funaya Houses.

1622
01:02:44,240 --> 01:02:45,607
- Ine Floating Village. / - Right.

1623
01:02:45,607 --> 01:02:48,307
I'd love to live there for like a month.

1624
01:02:48,307 --> 01:02:49,440
Right?

1625
01:02:50,474 --> 01:02:51,640
I see bicycles!

1626
01:02:52,040 --> 01:02:53,607
What was your fantasy?

1627
01:02:53,607 --> 01:02:54,807
Riding a bicycle.

1628
01:02:55,074 --> 01:02:56,607
What do you want to do on a trip?

1629
01:02:56,607 --> 01:02:57,674
Bike riding.

1630
01:02:57,674 --> 01:02:58,874
- You want to go bike riding? / - Yes.

1631
01:02:58,874 --> 01:03:01,040
When you see in those romance movies...

1632
01:03:01,507 --> 01:03:03,407
- Actresses always ride a bicycle. / - That's right.

1633
01:03:03,407 --> 01:03:05,374
- Let's go. / - She likes romance cartoons.

1634
01:03:05,374 --> 01:03:07,307
- Romance dramas. / - She wanted to ride a bike.

1635
01:03:07,307 --> 01:03:10,174
- I love that. / - You can borrow it for free.

1636
01:03:10,407 --> 01:03:12,807
All we have to do is return the bicycle. That's it.

1637
01:03:13,140 --> 01:03:14,907
This has been my fantasy. I'm excited.

1638
01:03:14,907 --> 01:03:16,074
I'm so excited.

1639
01:03:16,274 --> 01:03:17,474
(Her laugh is high-pitched)

1640
01:03:18,407 --> 01:03:20,440
- This is no joke. / - That was your first scream.

1641
01:03:21,707 --> 01:03:23,174
(Here we go!)

1642
01:03:23,440 --> 01:03:25,207
I'm sorry to choose this song,

1643
01:03:25,207 --> 01:03:27,307
but please play "To Me Again" by THETHE.

1644
01:03:27,307 --> 01:03:28,440
You can't sing it wrong.

1645
01:03:28,440 --> 01:03:29,407
(Getting ready to sing)

1646
01:03:30,140 --> 01:03:32,874
♪ One day ♪

1647
01:03:32,874 --> 01:03:34,140
The song is perfect.

1648
01:03:34,140 --> 01:03:35,307
♪ As I walk down the street ♪

1649
01:03:36,840 --> 01:03:39,374
This is awesome. Mimi!

1650
01:03:40,040 --> 01:03:41,407
Mimi!

1651
01:03:42,907 --> 01:03:45,774
- This is great. / - I'm going crazy.

1652
01:03:45,774 --> 01:03:48,307
- Shinyoung. / - This is crazy.

1653
01:03:48,307 --> 01:03:49,840
Look at the wildflowers. They're beautiful.

1654
01:03:51,340 --> 01:03:54,440
This place and the bicycles are perfect together.

1655
01:03:54,440 --> 01:03:56,374
It's so pretty.

1656
01:03:56,440 --> 01:03:59,274
I feel like I'm the heroine of a movie.

1657
01:03:59,274 --> 01:04:00,374
- Really? / - I understand that feeling.

1658
01:04:00,374 --> 01:04:02,774
We're filming a movie.

1659
01:04:03,174 --> 01:04:05,174
She said she wanted to film a movie.

1660
01:04:06,607 --> 01:04:07,940
Like in a drama.

1661
01:04:09,307 --> 01:04:10,640
(A brief encounter)

1662
01:04:10,940 --> 01:04:13,074
The vintage shop hottie.

1663
01:04:13,074 --> 01:04:14,740
I actually liked you.

1664
01:04:14,740 --> 01:04:16,040
(She couldn't confess it back then)

1665
01:04:16,040 --> 01:04:17,040
I remember him.

1666
01:04:17,374 --> 01:04:18,607
The vintage shop guy?

1667
01:04:19,274 --> 01:04:21,874
I couldn't say it because of my position.

1668
01:04:22,174 --> 01:04:23,440
(A love story that transcends class)

1669
01:04:23,540 --> 01:04:25,607
I couldn't say it because of my position.

1670
01:04:25,607 --> 01:04:27,107
What do you mean by position?

1671
01:04:27,107 --> 01:04:28,440
The heroine changed.

1672
01:04:28,440 --> 01:04:31,107
A girl has to ride in the back.

1673
01:04:31,107 --> 01:04:32,607
- What? / - She would stretch her arms out...

1674
01:04:32,607 --> 01:04:37,207
- And feel the wind. / - Like "Love Letter."

1675
01:04:37,207 --> 01:04:38,540
We're going to see it now.

1676
01:04:39,340 --> 01:04:42,407
Look to your left. It's so pretty.

1677
01:04:42,407 --> 01:04:44,407
- That's the sea! / - Amazing.

1678
01:04:44,407 --> 01:04:47,507
- This was my fantasy! / - The sea!

1679
01:04:47,740 --> 01:04:48,907
(The sea appears)

1680
01:04:49,574 --> 01:04:51,707
- Unbelievable. / - Hey.

1681
01:04:52,174 --> 01:04:53,707
(Admiring)

1682
01:04:54,474 --> 01:04:56,874
- Shinyoung, I'm the heroine. / - It's beautiful.

1683
01:04:56,874 --> 01:04:59,640
- Hey, I'm the heroine. / - The heroine.

1684
01:05:03,974 --> 01:05:06,407
I'm happy.

1685
01:05:08,907 --> 01:05:10,907
(A peaceful and beautiful landscape)

1686
01:05:11,807 --> 01:05:13,174
This is it.

1687
01:05:14,840 --> 01:05:16,574
Wow, this is insane.

1688
01:05:16,740 --> 01:05:20,040
This is the photo zone.

1689
01:05:21,007 --> 01:05:22,740
- This is the photo zone. / - It's like a painting.

1690
01:05:22,740 --> 01:05:24,374
This will be legendary. Stay right there.

1691
01:05:24,374 --> 01:05:26,374
In front of there?

1692
01:05:26,374 --> 01:05:29,540
- So pretty. / - This is the best girlfriend picture.

1693
01:05:31,874 --> 01:05:33,974
- It's like shooting a commercial. / - So pretty.

1694
01:05:34,574 --> 01:05:36,307
(Shinyoung takes cute pictures too)

1695
01:05:36,840 --> 01:05:38,974
Oh, you look cool.

1696
01:05:38,974 --> 01:05:40,240
"The Fishermen and the City."

1697
01:05:40,307 --> 01:05:42,474
- What are you doing? / - Come on.

1698
01:05:42,474 --> 01:05:45,007
- It suits you. / - Don't male idols usually do that?

1699
01:05:45,007 --> 01:05:47,474
- That suits you. / - I love doing stuff like this.

1700
01:05:47,474 --> 01:05:49,440
- How cute. / - That looks great.

1701
01:05:51,140 --> 01:05:52,307
That's cute.

1702
01:05:52,440 --> 01:05:54,674
(Evolution of funny pictures in 3 stages)

1703
01:05:55,074 --> 01:05:56,774
- This is great. / - That's so pretty.

1704
01:05:56,774 --> 01:05:57,774
Picture of a lifetime.

1705
01:05:58,340 --> 01:06:01,040
There's a famous SNS photo spot.

1706
01:06:01,040 --> 01:06:04,007
- It's a photo spot. / - There's a cafe with a view.

1707
01:06:04,007 --> 01:06:06,140
- It's a floating cafe. / - That cafe's so nice.

1708
01:06:06,607 --> 01:06:07,807
This is great.

1709
01:06:08,507 --> 01:06:10,507
- The view. / - Japan has good coffee.

1710
01:06:10,507 --> 01:06:12,940
- There's a place where you take photos. / - A given.

1711
01:06:13,307 --> 01:06:15,907
- They set a stop for photos. / - Look at my stance.

1712
01:06:16,074 --> 01:06:17,007
Busy taking each other's photos.

1713
01:06:17,007 --> 01:06:18,140
I updated my SNS so often.

1714
01:06:18,140 --> 01:06:20,574
That photo spot is reserved for photos.

1715
01:06:20,574 --> 01:06:22,240
You can sit there and drink coffee.

1716
01:06:22,240 --> 01:06:24,074
You can only take photos there.

1717
01:06:24,074 --> 01:06:26,807
- So it's just for photos. / - There's more upstairs.

1718
01:06:26,807 --> 01:06:28,107
If we go upstairs...

1719
01:06:29,174 --> 01:06:30,607
Unbelievable.

1720
01:06:32,074 --> 01:06:33,774
Wow, look at that.

1721
01:06:34,440 --> 01:06:35,807
This seat.

1722
01:06:36,040 --> 01:06:37,807
I can see under the water.

1723
01:06:37,807 --> 01:06:39,607
Look below. You can see everything.

1724
01:06:41,274 --> 01:06:42,374
I'm about to cry.

1725
01:06:42,374 --> 01:06:43,540
The view was so...

1726
01:06:43,540 --> 01:06:44,540
It's so beautiful.

1727
01:06:44,540 --> 01:06:45,874
To die for.

1728
01:06:46,340 --> 01:06:47,474
- It felt like we were resting. / - What's that?

1729
01:06:47,474 --> 01:06:49,807
- Dessert. / - Cake.

1730
01:06:50,507 --> 01:06:52,574
I want to live here.

1731
01:06:52,574 --> 01:06:53,940
- I really want to live here. / - I do too.

1732
01:06:53,940 --> 01:06:55,974
I understand what you mean.

1733
01:06:56,074 --> 01:06:57,807
(A peaceful break time)

1734
01:06:58,740 --> 01:07:00,840
(This is inner healing)

1735
01:07:01,807 --> 01:07:03,507
When we were riding bicycles we said,

1736
01:07:03,507 --> 01:07:04,874
"It smells like liquor."

1737
01:07:04,874 --> 01:07:06,940
- "It smells like rice wine." / - That's right.

1738
01:07:06,940 --> 01:07:08,940
There's a distillery.

1739
01:07:08,940 --> 01:07:10,407
It looks like a distillery, right?

1740
01:07:11,207 --> 01:07:13,174
- It smells like rice wine. / - It does.

1741
01:07:14,040 --> 01:07:15,707
I don't know any Chinese characters,

1742
01:07:15,707 --> 01:07:17,074
but I know the character for "alcohol."

1743
01:07:17,507 --> 01:07:20,640
The place is over 260 years old.

1744
01:07:20,874 --> 01:07:22,074
You must go inside.

1745
01:07:22,074 --> 01:07:23,407
What's this?

1746
01:07:23,407 --> 01:07:25,374
- I think it's squid. / - Right?

1747
01:07:25,374 --> 01:07:27,440
I'm so curious about this.

1748
01:07:28,274 --> 01:07:30,307
There are so many people in here.

1749
01:07:30,974 --> 01:07:32,907
This is it. Check this out.

1750
01:07:33,240 --> 01:07:34,607
Is that it? Here it is.

1751
01:07:34,607 --> 01:07:36,340
- You'll be shocked. / - It's squid.

1752
01:07:36,340 --> 01:07:37,874
- It's a bottle. / - Squid bottle?

1753
01:07:37,874 --> 01:07:38,974
It's a squid liquor bottle.

1754
01:07:38,974 --> 01:07:41,007
Won't it get soggy if you drink from this?

1755
01:07:41,007 --> 01:07:43,074
- It could... / - That's an actual squid!

1756
01:07:43,074 --> 01:07:45,174
You break it off and eat it with your drinks.

1757
01:07:45,174 --> 01:07:48,107
After you drink everything, you can eat it.

1758
01:07:48,107 --> 01:07:50,274
When it becomes soft, you can eat it then.

1759
01:07:50,307 --> 01:07:52,574
- People who drink will love it. / - Are you buying gifts?

1760
01:07:52,574 --> 01:07:54,040
- An Youngmi, Shin Bongseon. / - Like a fruit cup.

1761
01:07:54,040 --> 01:07:56,474
- You have to get one for Youngmi. / - Of course.

1762
01:07:56,774 --> 01:07:58,740
I should get one for my dad.

1763
01:07:58,740 --> 01:08:00,074
My dad, too.

1764
01:08:00,974 --> 01:08:02,440
- One for your dad. / - Yes.

1765
01:08:02,574 --> 01:08:03,774
- Sake. / - Ice.

1766
01:08:03,774 --> 01:08:05,407
It's sake ice cream.

1767
01:08:05,407 --> 01:08:07,440
- Sake ice cream? / - Yes.

1768
01:08:07,440 --> 01:08:09,907
- Do you get drunk if you eat it? / - No, no.

1769
01:08:09,907 --> 01:08:12,074
- No? / - It's really delicious.

1770
01:08:12,074 --> 01:08:13,540
They give you samples.

1771
01:08:13,540 --> 01:08:16,007
- Black rice. / - That was incredible. So good.

1772
01:08:16,540 --> 01:08:18,240
- Cheers. / - Our first drink.

1773
01:08:18,240 --> 01:08:19,740
It's our first drink.

1774
01:08:20,274 --> 01:08:21,974
(They drink together for the first time)

1775
01:08:25,240 --> 01:08:26,707
It's clean.

1776
01:08:26,707 --> 01:08:29,074
- It wasn't too strong. / - "Clean."

1777
01:08:29,874 --> 01:08:31,807
You buy so much every time.

1778
01:08:31,807 --> 01:08:34,407
- That squid bottle is interesting. / - You buy a lot.

1779
01:08:35,974 --> 01:08:37,540
We bought a lot.

1780
01:08:38,974 --> 01:08:40,240
- Thank you. / - Thank you.

1781
01:08:40,240 --> 01:08:42,574
Also, there's one more thing.

1782
01:08:42,574 --> 01:08:43,274
More?

1783
01:08:43,274 --> 01:08:44,474
- There's more? / - She's buying too much.

1784
01:08:44,474 --> 01:08:46,374
- There's more? / - Not that way.

1785
01:08:46,374 --> 01:08:48,207
- Today's our last day. / - We've bought these...

1786
01:08:48,507 --> 01:08:49,907
We've been to a distillery.

1787
01:08:49,907 --> 01:08:51,874
It's similar to the place we went on the first night.

1788
01:08:51,874 --> 01:08:53,607
- That's right. / - The cart bar?

1789
01:08:53,607 --> 01:08:55,040
- Yes. / - That's it.

1790
01:08:55,040 --> 01:08:57,407
This is like that place.

1791
01:08:57,407 --> 01:08:59,707
- Here. / - It feels like we're eating on a boat.

1792
01:08:59,707 --> 01:09:02,440
It's floating. It moves around.

1793
01:09:02,440 --> 01:09:04,174
- Just like a boat. / - I love things like this.

1794
01:09:04,174 --> 01:09:06,840
- I love it. / - You'd get drunk.

1795
01:09:06,840 --> 01:09:09,240
The breeze is so nice.

1796
01:09:10,040 --> 01:09:11,540
The wind feels really clean.

1797
01:09:11,540 --> 01:09:14,440
- The waves are gentle. / - It's so nice.

1798
01:09:14,440 --> 01:09:16,407
- Because of the island. / - It's blocking the wind.

1799
01:09:16,407 --> 01:09:19,174
- This is the black rice. / - Is this it?

1800
01:09:19,174 --> 01:09:20,640
- It's made with black rice sake. / - Black rice sake.

1801
01:09:20,640 --> 01:09:23,540
- Can you drunk off that? / - No.

1802
01:09:24,274 --> 01:09:27,140
- You can't taste the alcohol. / - Can't taste it at all.

1803
01:09:27,774 --> 01:09:29,474
You can smell it a little bit.

1804
01:09:29,474 --> 01:09:31,274
That looks so good.

1805
01:09:31,274 --> 01:09:32,274
It's so good.

1806
01:09:33,240 --> 01:09:36,040
The ice cream has texture like sorbet.

1807
01:09:36,040 --> 01:09:36,740
You're right.

1808
01:09:36,740 --> 01:09:40,374
This ice cream has a stronger sake flavor.

1809
01:09:40,374 --> 01:09:42,407
The waffle hardly had any alcohol scent.

1810
01:09:42,740 --> 01:09:44,140
I love this.

1811
01:09:44,374 --> 01:09:48,174
Hey, I love this squid bottle.

1812
01:09:48,174 --> 01:09:50,240
It's such a good idea.

1813
01:09:51,240 --> 01:09:53,107
The squid bottle is $8.50.

1814
01:09:53,307 --> 01:09:55,574
- Is this it? / - This, this.

1815
01:09:56,040 --> 01:09:57,674
You'll break your teeth.

1816
01:09:57,674 --> 01:09:59,474
- That's really tasty. / - What?

1817
01:09:59,474 --> 01:10:00,940
It must be completely dried squid.

1818
01:10:00,940 --> 01:10:03,574
Yes, it's dried and it's very thin.

1819
01:10:04,540 --> 01:10:05,707
- It expires... / - 3 months...

1820
01:10:05,707 --> 01:10:09,707
It'll become soft when you drink from it.

1821
01:10:10,740 --> 01:10:13,107
This way you won't have bottle and cup waste.

1822
01:10:13,107 --> 01:10:14,307
You can eat it right away.

1823
01:10:17,240 --> 01:10:19,174
Is this the end?

1824
01:10:19,540 --> 01:10:22,040
- I don't want to go home. / - This is our last stop.

1825
01:10:22,040 --> 01:10:23,774
We're going back on the evening flight.

1826
01:10:25,007 --> 01:10:27,240
- I got something for you. / - What is it?

1827
01:10:28,440 --> 01:10:32,540
She's a very pretty person. Really.

1828
01:10:32,540 --> 01:10:37,007
Her existence itself is just lovely.

1829
01:10:37,440 --> 01:10:40,707
I wanted to make her something...

1830
01:10:41,140 --> 01:10:42,307
(Don't look)

1831
01:10:42,307 --> 01:10:43,607
- Why? / - I'm embarrassed.

1832
01:10:43,607 --> 01:10:44,674
What is it?

1833
01:10:46,107 --> 01:10:48,840
But I don't know if she'll accept it.

1834
01:10:49,440 --> 01:10:50,540
(After a long deliberation)

1835
01:10:51,107 --> 01:10:53,840
I'm going to write lyrics for Shinyoung.

1836
01:10:53,840 --> 01:10:55,340
Goodness.

1837
01:10:55,707 --> 01:10:57,240
- It's a song. / - A song as a gift.

1838
01:10:57,240 --> 01:10:58,874
- That's the best gift. / - I'll write it at home.

1839
01:10:58,874 --> 01:11:01,907
- Rap. / - I should've done that.

1840
01:11:03,174 --> 01:11:08,407
Yes. The words are all in here.

1841
01:11:08,707 --> 01:11:10,274
I'm going to record it.

1842
01:11:10,274 --> 01:11:13,674
I wrote them before the trip. That's before the trip.

1843
01:11:15,374 --> 01:11:16,774
(Embarrassed)

1844
01:11:17,107 --> 01:11:19,907
Because you prepared such a great trip...

1845
01:11:20,474 --> 01:11:24,207
Even before the trip and during the trip,

1846
01:11:24,207 --> 01:11:25,474
I wrote some lyrics.

1847
01:11:26,440 --> 01:11:29,540
Oh, cringe. You're making me cringe!

1848
01:11:30,874 --> 01:11:33,007
- Cringe. / - I was embarrassed.

1849
01:11:35,007 --> 01:11:37,107
- Go ahead. / - I'm ready.

1850
01:11:37,107 --> 01:11:38,874
- Please look the other way. / - Okay.

1851
01:11:38,874 --> 01:11:39,974
Here goes.

1852
01:11:39,974 --> 01:11:42,807
- "To the Beautiful You." / - It's to "B612."

1853
01:11:42,807 --> 01:11:46,140
♪ Honestly, it's a bit awkward ♪

1854
01:11:46,874 --> 01:11:49,207
♪ If it's a no, it's a no from the start ♪

1855
01:11:50,507 --> 01:11:52,074
(Shinyoung hears it for the first time)

1856
01:11:52,340 --> 01:11:54,140
(If it's a no, it's a no from the start)

1857
01:11:54,140 --> 01:11:56,040
- Did you actually record this? / - Yeah.

1858
01:11:56,040 --> 01:11:57,240
I recorded it.

1859
01:11:58,340 --> 01:12:00,574
The song that's playing now, is the song you wrote?

1860
01:12:00,574 --> 01:12:02,007
Yes.

1861
01:12:02,007 --> 01:12:04,174
Wow, this is the best.

1862
01:12:05,640 --> 01:12:06,974
So it's this song.

1863
01:12:06,974 --> 01:12:08,774
(You are so pretty in my eyes)

1864
01:12:08,907 --> 01:12:10,874
I almost cried.

1865
01:12:10,874 --> 01:12:13,640
I don't think she wrote the lyrics...

1866
01:12:13,707 --> 01:12:15,207
Just because we had this trip.

1867
01:12:15,207 --> 01:12:17,407
She must've thought about me a lot...

1868
01:12:17,407 --> 01:12:21,040
- In order to complete the lyrics. / - That's right.

1869
01:12:21,040 --> 01:12:24,407
(I hope you keep smiling like a kid)

1870
01:12:24,907 --> 01:12:29,374
(You'll be by my side, and I'll be by your side)

1871
01:12:29,374 --> 01:12:32,174
- Shinyoung, you're a lucky person. / - She is.

1872
01:12:32,540 --> 01:12:35,740
Shinyoung, be good to Mimi.

1873
01:12:35,740 --> 01:12:36,940
- I'll be good. / - What about me?

1874
01:12:36,940 --> 01:12:38,240
She's good to me.

1875
01:12:38,240 --> 01:12:39,807
- What about me? / - Be good to her.

1876
01:12:39,807 --> 01:12:41,440
What about me?

1877
01:12:41,874 --> 01:12:43,907
- It's sincere. / - It is.

1878
01:12:43,907 --> 01:12:45,907
I wrote it while thinking about you.

1879
01:12:47,007 --> 01:12:49,940
I liked it because of you.

1880
01:12:49,940 --> 01:12:52,407
- "I liked it because of you." / - Shinyoung's trip...

1881
01:12:52,407 --> 01:12:56,274
Gets your money's worth.

1882
01:12:56,274 --> 01:12:59,774
I got my money's worth until the end.

1883
01:13:00,174 --> 01:13:01,040
We went on a trip together but

1884
01:13:01,040 --> 01:13:02,640
she bought my gifts too.

1885
01:13:02,640 --> 01:13:04,307
Even though I was right there.

1886
01:13:04,440 --> 01:13:06,174
That's so precious.

1887
01:13:06,174 --> 01:13:07,807
I think I bought a lot of gifts.

1888
01:13:07,807 --> 01:13:09,774
It wasn't over until it was over.

1889
01:13:09,774 --> 01:13:10,974
Isn't this a new flavor?

1890
01:13:10,974 --> 01:13:13,340
- You don't stop. / - Scorched rice flavor?

1891
01:13:14,274 --> 01:13:16,274
- It's a sample. / - Samples.

1892
01:13:19,374 --> 01:13:21,807
It has a slight scorched rice flavor.

1893
01:13:22,840 --> 01:13:25,340
- For the members. / - We have members.

1894
01:13:25,340 --> 01:13:26,407
I had to buy for the members.

1895
01:13:26,407 --> 01:13:27,974
Shinyoung is warm-hearted,

1896
01:13:27,974 --> 01:13:30,307
so she takes care of others wherever she goes.

1897
01:13:30,307 --> 01:13:31,674
I'll buy it.

1898
01:13:32,974 --> 01:13:35,374
The happiest moment during the trip?

1899
01:13:35,774 --> 01:13:37,240
- When we went to Ine. / - When we went to Ine.

1900
01:13:37,240 --> 01:13:38,540
See?

1901
01:13:38,540 --> 01:13:39,774
We both said the same thing.

1902
01:13:39,774 --> 01:13:41,807
When we just sat there.

1903
01:13:41,807 --> 01:13:44,107
I love Ine Village.

1904
01:13:45,707 --> 01:13:47,774
We just sat around. We didn't do anything.

1905
01:13:47,774 --> 01:13:50,707
Don't. Don't do anything.

1906
01:13:51,740 --> 01:13:54,274
- Whether you go to Kyoto... / - Or don't go to Kyoto...

1907
01:13:54,274 --> 01:13:57,140
If you'll regret it, go to Kyoto!

1908
01:13:58,740 --> 01:14:01,207
- You must come! / - Come to Kyoto.

1909
01:14:02,874 --> 01:14:04,507
That was so nice.

1910
01:14:05,040 --> 01:14:07,674
I just stood up without realizing.

1911
01:14:07,674 --> 01:14:11,307
How did you like your first sukiyaki, Mimi?

1912
01:14:11,474 --> 01:14:14,240
My first sukiyaki...

1913
01:14:14,640 --> 01:14:16,840
- It was so good... / - Are you salivating?

1914
01:14:16,840 --> 01:14:20,140
Yes, even now. I really want to go.

1915
01:14:20,440 --> 01:14:22,774
Someday, just like Shinyoung says...

1916
01:14:22,774 --> 01:14:25,274
I'll take a junior there and

1917
01:14:25,274 --> 01:14:27,274
share that taste with them.

1918
01:14:27,274 --> 01:14:30,774
- A male junior? / - Yes, yes.

1919
01:14:30,774 --> 01:14:33,740
Male? He baited you.

1920
01:14:33,740 --> 01:14:35,207
He got you good.

1921
01:14:35,207 --> 01:14:35,940
I heard wrong.

1922
01:14:35,940 --> 01:14:37,407
She means boyfriend.

1923
01:14:37,407 --> 01:14:38,274
She'll take a male junior and say,

1924
01:14:38,274 --> 01:14:40,307
"You write the melody, I'll write the lyrics."

1925
01:14:40,474 --> 01:14:43,074
That's not it. I always tell her

1926
01:14:43,074 --> 01:14:44,774
that she doesn't need to be nice to me.

1927
01:14:44,774 --> 01:14:46,474
Take what she experienced with me

1928
01:14:46,474 --> 01:14:48,474
and share it with someone else traveling

1929
01:14:48,474 --> 01:14:49,740
for the first time.

1930
01:14:49,740 --> 01:14:51,007
That's because someone did that for you.

1931
01:14:51,007 --> 01:14:53,840
That's right. I got a lot from my seniors.

1932
01:14:53,840 --> 01:14:56,540
It was Mimi's first trip.

1933
01:14:56,540 --> 01:14:58,007
What was the most memorable thing?

1934
01:14:58,007 --> 01:15:00,540
It was Ine no Funaya Houses.

1935
01:15:00,540 --> 01:15:02,374
If you're there...

1936
01:15:02,374 --> 01:15:04,674
- It's just quiet. / - Peaceful and beautiful.

1937
01:15:04,674 --> 01:15:07,374
But she's only 24 years old.

1938
01:15:07,374 --> 01:15:10,274
She'd prefer clubs in a city to a rural town.

1939
01:15:10,274 --> 01:15:11,974
- She's not like that. / - She likes this stuff.

1940
01:15:11,974 --> 01:15:13,540
I've never been clubbing before.

1941
01:15:13,774 --> 01:15:16,340
Let's check the costs now.

1942
01:15:16,340 --> 01:15:19,740
The Hangzhou team spent $289.90 per person

1943
01:15:19,740 --> 01:15:21,340
for 3 days.

1944
01:15:21,340 --> 01:15:22,374
We had a lot of good food with it.

1945
01:15:22,374 --> 01:15:23,774
That's right. Then...

1946
01:15:23,774 --> 01:15:26,040
- Whether you go to Kyoto... / - Or don't go to Kyoto...

1947
01:15:26,040 --> 01:15:28,374
If you'll regret it, go to Kyoto!

1948
01:15:28,374 --> 01:15:30,774
- Your total expense was... / - I can't wait.

1949
01:15:30,774 --> 01:15:33,540
For 3 days...

1950
01:15:33,540 --> 01:15:35,040
- Per person. / - Per person.

1951
01:15:36,040 --> 01:15:38,507
$560.20.

1952
01:15:38,507 --> 01:15:41,707
- That's not a lot. / - It's not that much.

1953
01:15:41,707 --> 01:15:42,907
That's for 3 days.

1954
01:15:42,907 --> 01:15:44,040
I thought it'd be over $1,000.

1955
01:15:44,040 --> 01:15:46,707
It's not as expensive as you think.

1956
01:15:46,707 --> 01:15:49,007
It's because they didn't eat anything

1957
01:15:49,007 --> 01:15:50,440
that expensive after the sukiyaki meal.

1958
01:15:50,440 --> 01:15:52,174
That includes the $150 sukiyaki meal.

1959
01:15:52,174 --> 01:15:53,107
Yes, yes.

1960
01:15:53,107 --> 01:15:56,107
Please get ready to vote.

1961
01:15:56,307 --> 01:15:58,974
Whether you go to Kyoto. Or don't go to Kyoto.

1962
01:15:58,974 --> 01:16:01,407
If you'll regret it, go to Kyoto!

1963
01:16:01,407 --> 01:16:04,440
Will you follow their Kyoto itinerary and travel to Kyoto?

1964
01:16:04,440 --> 01:16:06,374
Please vote.

1965
01:16:06,940 --> 01:16:09,207

01:16:19,174 --> 01:16:22,307
- It is neck and neck. / - You never know.

1970
01:16:22,607 --> 01:16:25,707
What did the judges choose?

1971
01:16:26,140 --> 01:16:28,674
Toad Tour. Kyoto Tour.

1972
01:16:28,674 --> 01:16:29,740
Goodness...

1973
01:16:29,740 --> 01:16:31,707
- What is it? / - I'm nervous.

1974
01:16:31,707 --> 01:16:33,207
It's the first digit.

1975
01:16:33,207 --> 01:16:34,740
I really worked hard.

1976
01:16:34,740 --> 01:16:35,440
It's the first digit.

1977
01:16:35,440 --> 01:16:36,907
I really worked hard.

1978
01:16:36,907 --> 01:16:38,974
- It's the same! / - No!

1979
01:16:39,840 --> 01:16:41,640

This is amazing.

1983
01:16:57,974 --> 01:17:00,507
Minkyoung, how did you enjoy the show?

1984
01:17:00,507 --> 01:17:04,107
- Wasn't it great? / - I love traveling alone.

1985
01:17:04,107 --> 01:17:07,940
But after seeing two trips with great people...

1986
01:17:07,940 --> 01:17:10,074
- I was really happy. / - How hungry are you?

1987
01:17:10,074 --> 01:17:11,474
My skirt got loose.

1988
01:17:12,707 --> 01:17:14,474
She can fit her fist in there.
