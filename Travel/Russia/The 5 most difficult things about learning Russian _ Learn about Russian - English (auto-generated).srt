7
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:08,960  
who's learning Russian I can tell you
that there are so many complexities to

8
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:08,970  
that there are so many complexities to

the Russian language in this video I'm

10
00:00:11,629 --> 00:00:11,639

the Russian language in this video I'm
going to discuss five of the most

12
00:00:13,549 --> 00:00:13,559  
going to discuss five of the most
 

13
00:00:13,559 --> 00:00:15,589  
going to discuss five of the most
difficult things about learning Russian

14
00:00:15,589 --> 00:00:15,599  
difficult things about learning Russian
 

15
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:20,090  
difficult things about learning Russian
let's get started

16
00:00:20,090 --> 00:00:20,100  
 
 

17
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:24,120  
 
cases the Russian language has six cases

18
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:24,130  
cases the Russian language has six cases
 

19
00:00:24,130 --> 00:00:26,550  
cases the Russian language has six cases
and each case denotes the function of a

20
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:26,560  
and each case denotes the function of a
 

21
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:29,540  
and each case denotes the function of a
word so for example in English we say I

22
00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:29,550  
word so for example in English we say I
 

23
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:36,870  
word so for example in English we say I
saw him he saw me it's his basketball so

24
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:36,880  
saw him he saw me it's his basketball so
 

25
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:38,400  
saw him he saw me it's his basketball so
we know whether something's the subject

26
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:38,410  
we know whether something's the subject
 

27
00:00:38,410 --> 00:00:41,760  
we know whether something's the subject
the object possessive in Russian there

28
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:41,770  
the object possessive in Russian there
 

29
00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:44,340  
the object possessive in Russian there
are six of these cases and it's

30
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:44,350  
are six of these cases and it's
 

31
00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:45,180  
are six of these cases and it's
exhausting

32
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:45,190  
exhausting
 

33
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:48,229  
exhausting
there's nominative accusative genitive

34
00:00:48,229 --> 00:00:48,239  
there's nominative accusative genitive
 

35
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:51,540

instrumental prepositional and dative
 

37
00:00:51,550 --> 00:00:55,049  
instrumental prepositional and dative
and because of these cases word order in

38
00:00:55,049 --> 00:00:55,059  
and because of these cases word order in
 

39
00:00:55,059 --> 00:00:57,090  
and because of these cases word order in
Russian sentences can change and the

40
00:00:57,090 --> 00:00:57,100  
Russian sentences can change and the
 

41
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:59,310  
Russian sentences can change and the
meaning stays the same because you have

42
00:00:59,310 --> 00:00:59,320  
meaning stays the same because you have
 

43
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:01,470  
meaning stays the same because you have
these cases preserving the functions of

44
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:01,480  
these cases preserving the functions of
 

45
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:02,399  
these cases preserving the functions of
each word

46
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:02,409  
each word
 

47
00:01:02,409 --> 00:01:04,500

at the tail ends of each word to figure
 

55
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:13,530  
at the tail ends of each word to figure
out what the subject is acting on which

56
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:13,540  
out what the subject is acting on which
 

57
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:17,550  
out what the subject is acting on which
objects and in what context imperfective
