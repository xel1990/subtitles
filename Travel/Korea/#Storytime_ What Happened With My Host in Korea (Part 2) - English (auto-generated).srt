whole time I was very reluctant to call
 

1031
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:29,870  
whole time I was very reluctant to call
Airbnb because I knew that they were

1032
00:18:29,870 --> 00:18:29,880  
Airbnb because I knew that they were
 

1033
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:31,820  
Airbnb because I knew that they were
going to contact him and I didn't want

1034
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:31,830  
going to contact him and I didn't want
 

1035
00:18:31,830 --> 00:18:33,440  
going to contact him and I didn't want
him to know that I had contacted them

1036
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:33,450  
him to know that I had contacted them

him to know that I had contacted them
until I had all my stuff until I was

00:18:35,570 --> 00:18:35,580  
until I had all my stuff until I was
 

1039
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:38,900  
until I had all my stuff until I was
completely laid out of that situation so

1040
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:38,910  
completely laid out of that situation so
 

1041
00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:40,220  
completely laid out of that situation so
at this point I was sitting on the bed

1042
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:40,230  
at this point I was sitting on the bed
 

1043
00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:41,660  
at this point I was sitting on the bed
and I was like I don't know what else to

1044
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:41,670  
and I was like I don't know what else to
