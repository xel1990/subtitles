the airport could close like you there's

104
00:01:41,899 --> 00:01:41,909  
the airport could close like you there's
 

105
00:01:41,909 --> 00:01:43,639  
the airport could close like you there's
so many things that could happen and

so many things that could happen and
 

107
00:01:43,649 --> 00:01:45,620  
so many things that could happen and
maybe it was cheaper to do it that way

108
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:45,630  
maybe it was cheaper to do it that way
 

109
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:48,080  
maybe it was cheaper to do it that way

113
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:50,990  
and now you're gonna be paying thousands
of dollars so it's definitely not

114
00:01:50,990 --> 00:01:51,000  
of dollars so it's definitely not
 

115
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,149  
of dollars so it's definitely not
cheaper anymore I pretty much never do

116
00:01:53,149 --> 00:01:53,159  
cheaper anymore I pretty much never do
 

117
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:56,510  
cheaper anymore I pretty much never do
