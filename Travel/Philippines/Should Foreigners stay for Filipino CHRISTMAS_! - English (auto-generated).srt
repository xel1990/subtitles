probably we're not traveling it's hard

446
00:07:57,490 --> 00:07:57,500  
probably we're not traveling it's hard
 

447
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:58,900  
probably we're not traveling it's hard
because every country is very different

448
00:07:58,900 --> 00:07:58,910  
because every country is very different
 

449
00:07:58,910 --> 00:08:00,040  
because every country is very different
but I'm sure we can come to some sort of

450
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:00,050  
but I'm sure we can come to some sort of
 

451
00:08:00,050 --> 00:08:02,470  
but I'm sure we can come to some sort of
average we probably spend about three or

452
00:08:02,470 --> 00:08:02,480  
average we probably spend about three or
 

453
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:04,510  
average we probably spend about three or
four pounds each on breakfast do like

454
00:08:04,510 --> 00:08:04,520  
four pounds each on breakfast do like
 

455
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:08,020  
four pounds each on breakfast do like
seven pounds yeah then we'll probably

456
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:08,030  
seven pounds yeah then we'll probably
 

457
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:09,550  
seven pounds yeah then we'll probably

that could be like 505 pounds so then we

460
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:12,440  
that could be like 505 pounds so then we
 

461
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:14,050  
that could be like 505 pounds so then we
