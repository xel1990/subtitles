and which is going to use a hell of a
 

341
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:32,469  
and which is going to use a hell of a

342
00:08:32,469 --> 00:08:32,479  
lot of data but hopefully it's fairly
 

343
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:35,020  
lot of data but hopefully it's fairly
easy to top it up and do but I guess

344

easy to top it up and do but I guess
 

345
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:35,980  
easy to top it up and do but I guess
it's a good thing cuz it means then
