hey guys after talking about the blocked
accounting in so many videos we finally

4
00:00:05,269 --> 00:00:05,279  
accounting in so many videos we finally
 

5
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:06,980  
accounting in so many videos we finally
have a really good news for you guys

last few weeks honey
so we are very excited it coracle and as

22
00:00:25,849 --> 00:00:25,859  
so we are very excited it coracle and as
 

23
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:27,140  
so we are very excited it coracle and as
you mentioned we have been talking about

24
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:27,150  
you mentioned we have been talking about
 

25
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:29,769  
you mentioned we have been talking about
this quite some time yeah in everything

26
00:00:29,769 --> 00:00:29,779  
this quite some time yeah in everything
 

27
00:00:29,779 --> 00:00:32,269  
this quite some time yeah in everything
maybe the block the court will come up

28
00:00:32,269 --> 00:00:32,279  
maybe the block the court will come up
 

29
00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:33,770  
maybe the block the court will come up
soon some time but now it's finally

30
00:00:33,770 --> 00:00:33,780  
soon some time but now it's finally
 

31
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:35,389  
soon some time but now it's finally
there tell us something about the block

32
00:00:35,389 --> 00:00:35,399  
there tell us something about the block
 

33
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:40,670  
there tell us something about the block
the code okay um so as everyone expects

34
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:40,680  
the code okay um so as everyone expects
 

35
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:43,729  
the code okay um so as everyone expects
the coracle account like the other

36
00:00:43,729 --> 00:00:43,739  
the coracle account like the other
 

37
00:00:43,739 --> 00:00:46,220  
the coracle account like the other
solution it's it's straightforward so

38
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:46,230  
solution it's it's straightforward so
 

39
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:48,380  
solution it's it's straightforward so
it's very transferring very simple but

40
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:48,390  
it's very transferring very simple but
 

41
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:49,880  
it's very transferring very simple but
functional it will be the cheapest in

42
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:49,890  
functional it will be the cheapest in
 

43
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:52,850  
functional it will be the cheapest in
the market at least as of now so it will

44
00:00:52,850 --> 00:00:52,860  
the market at least as of now so it will
 

45
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:55,220  
the market at least as of now so it will
cost around so it will cost 19 euros a

46
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:55,230  
cost around so it will cost 19 euros a
 

47
00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:57,049  
cost around so it will cost 19 euros a

health insurance can also be done in
just five minutes through crackle like

92
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:39,990

have a ideally shouldn't start applying

104
00:01:55,639 --> 00:01:55,649  
have a ideally shouldn't start applying
 

105
00:01:55,649 --> 00:01:57,830  
have a ideally shouldn't start applying
for the blocked account once they have

106
00:01:57,830 --> 00:01:57,840  
for the blocked account once they have
 

107
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,770  
for the blocked account once they have
the first at MIT let's say but it is not

108
00:02:00,770 --> 00:02:00,780  
the first at MIT let's say but it is not
 

109
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:03,139  
the first at MIT let's say but it is not
mandatory and in the past we have also

110
00:02:03,139 --> 00:02:03,149  
mandatory and in the past we have also
 

111
00:02:03,149 --> 00:02:05,600  
mandatory and in the past we have also
seen that it gives the flexibility for

112
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:05,610  
seen that it gives the flexibility for
 

113
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:07,010  
seen that it gives the flexibility for
the students to up to transfer the money

114
00:02:07,010 --> 00:02:07,020  
the students to up to transfer the money
 

115
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:08,210  
the students to up to transfer the money
any time because

116
00:02:08,210 --> 00:02:08,220  
any time because
 

117
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:09,800  
any time because
stockholders ready so you basically

118
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:09,810  
stockholders ready so you basically
 

119
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:12,140  
stockholders ready so you basically
decides when you wanted to transfer the

120
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:12,150  
decides when you wanted to transfer the
 

121
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:13,670  
decides when you wanted to transfer the
money also like I was talking to Sammy

122
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:13,680  
money also like I was talking to Sammy
 

123
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,800  
money also like I was talking to Sammy
and it just takes like maximum two days

124
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:15,810  
and it just takes like maximum two days
 

125
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:18,020  
and it just takes like maximum two days
and like it can be processed within a

126
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:18,030  
and like it can be processed within a
 

127
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:19,970  
and like it can be processed within a
few hours so like this is absolutely

128
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:19,980  
few hours so like this is absolutely
 

129
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:21,350  
few hours so like this is absolutely
crazy I think like this could even be

130
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:21,360  
crazy I think like this could even be
 

131
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,480  
crazy I think like this could even be
one of the fastest blocked akan services

132
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:23,490  
one of the fastest blocked akan services
 

133
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:24,890  
one of the fastest blocked akan services
on the market right now

134
00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:24,900  
on the market right now
 

135
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:27,080  
on the market right now
so Sammy once the blocked account has

136
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:27,090  
so Sammy once the blocked account has
 

137
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:29,090  
so Sammy once the blocked account has
been opened now the confirmation has

138
00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:29,100  
been opened now the confirmation has
 

139
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:30,560  
been opened now the confirmation has
been saying what are the next steps

140
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:30,570  
been saying what are the next steps
 

141
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:32,450  
been saying what are the next steps
which the students have to take care of

142
00:02:32,450 --> 00:02:32,460  
which the students have to take care of
 

143
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:33,890  
which the students have to take care of
so technically to transfer the money is

144
00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:33,900  
so technically to transfer the money is
 

145
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:36,350  
so technically to transfer the money is
the next step but in some consulates

146
00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:36,360  
the next step but in some consulates
 

147
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:38,390  
the next step but in some consulates
they the students can already apply for

148
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:38,400  
they the students can already apply for
 

149
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,340  
they the students can already apply for
the visa just with opening confirmation

150
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:40,350  
the visa just with opening confirmation
 

151
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:42,470  
the visa just with opening confirmation
so some consulates accept this but some

152
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:42,480  
so some consulates accept this but some
 

153
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,390  
so some consulates accept this but some
consulates expect to have money in it

154
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:44,400  
consulates expect to have money in it
 

155
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,210  
consulates expect to have money in it
so basically students needs to transfer

156
00:02:47,210 --> 00:02:47,220  
so basically students needs to transfer
 

157
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:51,050  
so basically students needs to transfer
the the necessary amount so beta 8600

158
00:02:51,050 --> 00:02:51,060  
the the necessary amount so beta 8600
 

159
