right which are called far coke cooler

198
00:03:50,259 --> 00:03:50,269  
right which are called far coke cooler
 

199
00:03:50,269 --> 00:03:53,289  
right which are called far coke cooler
or coke seriously now the difference is

200
00:03:53,289 --> 00:03:53,299  
or coke seriously now the difference is
 

201

are again University of the tech focused
 

209
00:04:04,579 --> 00:04:07,270  
are again University of the tech focused
on technology like we have IITs right

210
00:04:07,270 --> 00:04:07,280  
on technology like we have IITs right
 

211
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,339  
on technology like we have IITs right
okay so that is a similarity

212
00:04:09,339 --> 00:04:09,349  
okay so that is a similarity
 

213
00:04:09,349 --> 00:04:12,250  
okay so that is a similarity
also the universities or technical

214

okay so it is more course drizzle right
 

297
00:05:56,539 --> 00:05:58,570  
okay so it is more course drizzle right
it means that you will choose those

298
