like bachelors Germans are more tailored

138
00:04:25,409 --> 00:04:25,419  
like bachelors Germans are more tailored
 

139
00:04:25,419 --> 00:04:28,450  
like bachelors Germans are more tailored
towards German industry and not the

00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:30,279  
towards German industry and not the
Indian one so like that would be really

142
00:04:30,279 --> 00:04:30,289  
Indian one so like that would be really
 

143
00:04:30,289 --> 00:04:33,040  
Indian one so like that would be really

144
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:33,050  
foolish to think that the German
 

145
00:04:33,050 --> 00:04:34,810  
foolish to think that the German

339
00:08:29,290 --> 00:08:31,320  
be the process third is going to be the
documents in that lengths of what exact

340
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:31,330  
documents in that lengths of what exact
 

341
00:08:31,330 --> 00:08:32,909  
documents in that lengths of what exact
documents do you need because till the

342

350
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:42,130  
into that but I think the deadlines part
 

351
00:08:42,130 --> 00:08:44,850  
into that but I think the deadlines part

352
00:08:44,850 --> 00:08:44,860  
is more important then there would be
 

353

should like definitely be very off
 

357
00:08:50,110 --> 00:08:52,980  
should like definitely be very off

1854
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:03,130  
to aim for b1 for b1 I would say for 3

1859
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:10,290  
your own from 5 to 8 hours every single
day it is going to be sufficient and

1860
00:40:10,290 --> 00:40:10,300  
day it is going to be sufficient and
 

1861
00:40:10,300 --> 00:40:12,360
