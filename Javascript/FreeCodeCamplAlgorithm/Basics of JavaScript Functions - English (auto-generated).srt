the advantage of video is you can pause

20
00:00:32,299 --> 00:00:32,309  
the advantage of video is you can pause
 

21
00:00:32,309 --> 00:00:35,209  
the advantage of video is you can pause
it you can rewind and re-watch certain

it you can rewind and re-watch certain
 

23
00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:38,119  
it you can rewind and re-watch certain
sections and there's also going to be a

24
00:00:38,119 --> 00:00:38,129  
sections and there's also going to be a
 

25
00:00:38,129 --> 00:00:39,590  
sections and there's also going to be a
github repository

26
00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:39,600  
github repository
 

27
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:43,010

so you can just watch the video

28
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:43,020  
so you can just watch the video
 

29
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:45,290  
so you can just watch the video
you know first to get familiar with the

you know first to get familiar with the
 

31
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:47,389  
you know first to get familiar with the
concepts and then you can copy and paste

32
00:00:47,389 --> 00:00:47,399  
concepts and then you can copy and paste
 

33
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:49,510  
concepts and then you can copy and paste

functions are and this is the basic
 

47
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:10,640  
functions are and this is the basic
syntax so what I have open right now

I'm gonna write everything in the atom
 

53
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:21,530  
I'm gonna write everything in the atom
editor I'm gonna have two files I have

54
00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:21,540  
editor I'm gonna have two files I have
 

55
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:24,380  
editor I'm gonna have two files I have
my JavaScript file which is where we'll

56
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:24,390  
my JavaScript file which is where we'll
 

57
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:26,450  
my JavaScript file which is where we'll
be doing all of the programming today

58
00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:26,460  
be doing all of the programming today
 

59
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:31,160  
be doing all of the programming today
and I've got a simple HTML file it's

60
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:31,170  
and I've got a simple HTML file it's
 

61
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:34,100  
and I've got a simple HTML file it's
really basic it has a couple of headers

62
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:34,110  
really basic it has a couple of headers
 

63
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:39,350  
really basic it has a couple of headers
and on line 11 this is where I embed my

64
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:39,360  
and on line 11 this is where I embed my
 

65
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:43,639  
and on line 11 this is where I embed my
JavaScript files and in I'm just going

66
00:01:43,639 --> 00:01:43,649  
JavaScript files and in I'm just going
 

67
00:01:43,649 --> 00:01:46,730  
JavaScript files and in I'm just going
to use the same HTML file for all of the

68
00:01:46,730 --> 00:01:46,740  
to use the same HTML file for all of the
 

69
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:48,710  
to use the same HTML file for all of the
lessons and I'll just change the file

70
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:48,720  
lessons and I'll just change the file
 

71
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:51,980  
lessons and I'll just change the file
name right here for each lesson and you

72
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:51,990  
name right here for each lesson and you
 

73
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:53,480  
name right here for each lesson and you
can do that too

74
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:53,490  
can do that too
 

75
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:57,530  
can do that too
so if you open this example dot HTML

76
00:01:57,530 --> 00:01:57,540  
so if you open this example dot HTML
 

77
00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:00,109  
so if you open this example dot HTML
file in your browser you're going to see

78
00:02:00,109 --> 00:02:00,119  
file in your browser you're going to see
 

79
00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:02,679  
file in your browser you're going to see
this nothing to see here

80
00:02:02,679 --> 00:02:02,689  
this nothing to see here
 

81
00:02:02,689 --> 00:02:06,590  
this nothing to see here
open your console in the dev tools so to

82
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:06,600  
open your console in the dev tools so to
 

83
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:10,360  
open your console in the dev tools so to
open that you go up here ok to view

84
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:10,370  
open that you go up here ok to view
 

85
00:02:10,370 --> 00:02:13,160  
open that you go up here ok to view
they'll choose developer and open

86
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:13,170  
they'll choose developer and open
 

87
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:16,390  
they'll choose developer and open
javascript console all right and

88
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:16,400  
javascript console all right and
 

89
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:19,190  
javascript console all right and
everything that we work with we're gonna

90
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:19,200  
everything that we work with we're gonna
 

91
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,920  
everything that we work with we're gonna
you know work with it right here in the

92
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:21,930  
you know work with it right here in the
 

93
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:26,750  
you know work with it right here in the
JavaScript console okay so let's just

94
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:26,760  
JavaScript console okay so let's just
 

95
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:31,180  
JavaScript console okay so let's just
jump right into it a function is written

96
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:31,190  
jump right into it a function is written
 

97
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:33,440  
jump right into it a function is written
starting with the function keyword and

98
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:33,450  
starting with the function keyword and
 

99
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:35,449  
starting with the function keyword and
then we're going to give it a name so

100
00:02:35,449 --> 00:02:35,459  
then we're going to give it a name so
 

101
00:02:35,459 --> 00:02:38,720  
then we're going to give it a name so
I'm gonna call it say say greeting

102
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:38,730  
I'm gonna call it say say greeting
 

103
00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:40,729  
I'm gonna call it say say greeting
that's the name of her function I'm

104
00:02:40,729 --> 00:02:40,739  
that's the name of her function I'm
 

105
00:02:40,739 --> 00:02:42,880  
that's the name of her function I'm
gonna give it a pair of parentheses and

106
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:42,890  
gonna give it a pair of parentheses and
 

107
00:02:42,890 --> 00:02:46,100  
gonna give it a pair of parentheses and
then I'm gonna show it some curly braces

108
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:46,110  
then I'm gonna show it some curly braces
 

109
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:49,910  
then I'm gonna show it some curly braces
and right here is where we write the

110
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:49,920  
and right here is where we write the
 

111
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:54,430  
and right here is where we write the
code by the way these two slashes this

112
00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:54,440  
code by the way these two slashes this
 

113
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:58,789  
code by the way these two slashes this
signifies a comment and the JavaScript

114
00:02:58,789 --> 00:02:58,799  
signifies a comment and the JavaScript
 

115
00:02:58,799 --> 00:03:00,830  
signifies a comment and the JavaScript
interpreter will not read this it's just

116
00:03:00,830 --> 00:03:00,840  
interpreter will not read this it's just
 

117
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:03,020  
interpreter will not read this it's just
gonna skip over it it's it's only for

118
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:03,030  
gonna skip over it it's it's only for
 

119
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:06,140  
gonna skip over it it's it's only for
humans to to read and not for the

120
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:06,150  
humans to to read and not for the
 

121
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:10,250  
humans to to read and not for the
computer so we start our function with

122
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:10,260  
computer so we start our function with
 

123
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:12,500  
computer so we start our function with
this code and it's not going to do

124
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:12,510  
this code and it's not going to do
 

125
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:15,530  
this code and it's not going to do
anything until we tell it to you know

126
00:03:15,530 --> 00:03:15,540  
anything until we tell it to you know
 

127
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:19,550  
anything until we tell it to you know
turn on and we call that invoking the

128
00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:19,560  
turn on and we call that invoking the
 

129
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:23,330  
turn on and we call that invoking the
function or calling the function and

130
00:03:23,330 --> 00:03:23,340  
function or calling the function and
 

131
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:26,780  
function or calling the function and
basically we just write the name of the

132
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:26,790  
basically we just write the name of the
 

133
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:32,690  
basically we just write the name of the
function with parentheses and then end

134
00:03:32,690 --> 00:03:32,700  
function with parentheses and then end
 

135
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:35,090  
function with parentheses and then end
it with a semicolon if we save that and

136
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:35,100  
it with a semicolon if we save that and
 

137
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:39,710  
it with a semicolon if we save that and
go to our web page alright we refresh

138
00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:39,720  
go to our web page alright we refresh
 

139
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:42,319  
go to our web page alright we refresh
the page and nothing's happening because

140
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:42,329  
the page and nothing's happening because
 

141
00:03:42,329 --> 00:03:45,050  
the page and nothing's happening because
our function isn't doing anything all

142
00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:45,060  
our function isn't doing anything all
 

143
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:48,160  
our function isn't doing anything all
right but let's make it do something now

144
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:48,170  
right but let's make it do something now
 

145
00:03:48,170 --> 00:03:53,420  
right but let's make it do something now
I'm going to write a message to the

146
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:53,430  
I'm going to write a message to the
 

147
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:56,599  
I'm going to write a message to the
console okay and if you remember the

148
00:03:56,599 --> 00:03:56,609  
console okay and if you remember the
 

149
00:03:56,609 --> 00:03:58,550  
console okay and if you remember the
console is just this window right here

150
00:03:58,550 --> 00:03:58,560  
console is just this window right here
 

151
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:01,160  
console is just this window right here
and it's not actually going to appear on

152
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:01,170  
and it's not actually going to appear on
 

153
00:04:01,170 --> 00:04:02,420  
and it's not actually going to appear on
the webpage

154
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:02,430  
the webpage
 

155
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:04,309  
the webpage
so let's write something to the console

156
00:04:04,309 --> 00:04:04,319  
so let's write something to the console
 

157
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:08,990  
so let's write something to the console
we write console log and then I'm gonna

158
00:04:08,990 --> 00:04:09,000  
we write console log and then I'm gonna
 

159
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:14,559  
we write console log and then I'm gonna
pass in a string hello free code camp

160
00:04:14,559 --> 00:04:14,569  
pass in a string hello free code camp
 

161
00:04:14,569 --> 00:04:17,840  
pass in a string hello free code camp
and I'm gonna end that line with the

162
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:17,850  
and I'm gonna end that line with the
 

163
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:21,140  
and I'm gonna end that line with the
semicolon now I'll save the file I'll go

164
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:21,150  
semicolon now I'll save the file I'll go
 

165
00:04:21,150 --> 00:04:23,930  
semicolon now I'll save the file I'll go
back to my browser and refresh and there

166
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:23,940  
back to my browser and refresh and there
 

167
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:24,529  
back to my browser and refresh and there
we go

168
00:04:24,529 --> 00:04:24,539  
we go
 

169
00:04:24,539 --> 00:04:27,020  
we go
we've just written our first function

170
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:27,030  
we've just written our first function
 

171
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:30,740  
we've just written our first function
so just to recap we've written the

172
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:30,750  
so just to recap we've written the
 

173
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:33,230  
so just to recap we've written the
function and it only does one thing it

174
00:04:33,230 --> 00:04:33,240  
function and it only does one thing it
 

175
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:36,260  
function and it only does one thing it
locks out this string this message to

176
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:36,270  
locks out this string this message to
 

177
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:38,960  
locks out this string this message to
the console and it's not gonna do

178
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:38,970  
the console and it's not gonna do
 

179
00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:43,370  
the console and it's not gonna do
anything okay if I comment that out it's

180
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:43,380  
anything okay if I comment that out it's
 

181
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:48,260  
anything okay if I comment that out it's
not gonna do anything until I call it so

182
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:48,270  
not gonna do anything until I call it so
 

183
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:52,550  
not gonna do anything until I call it so
I've commented that out but here I'm

184
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:52,560  
I've commented that out but here I'm
 

185
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:57,380  
I've commented that out but here I'm
calling it and if i refresh okay now we

186
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:57,390  
calling it and if i refresh okay now we
 

187
00:04:57,390 --> 00:04:58,010  
calling it and if i refresh okay now we
get it

188
00:04:58,010 --> 00:04:58,020  
get it
 

189
00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:02,420  
get it
so that is basically what what a

190
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:02,430  
so that is basically what what a
 

191
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:05,900  
so that is basically what what a
function does and I can also pass it a

192
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:05,910  
function does and I can also pass it a
 

193
00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:08,900  
function does and I can also pass it a
number of different arguments so let's

194
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:08,910  
number of different arguments so let's
 

195
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:10,130  
number of different arguments so let's
give it an argument

196
00:05:10,130 --> 00:05:10,140  
give it an argument
 

197
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:19,130  
give it an argument
let's call let's say hello okay

198
00:05:19,130 --> 00:05:19,140  
 
 

199
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:25,730  
 
and now instead of writing a string I'm

200
00:05:25,730 --> 00:05:25,740  
and now instead of writing a string I'm
 

201
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:28,040  
and now instead of writing a string I'm
just going to write in this placeholder

202
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:28,050  
just going to write in this placeholder
 

203
00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:30,950  
just going to write in this placeholder
so I'm calling this a greeting function

204
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:30,960  
so I'm calling this a greeting function
 

205
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:34,520  
so I'm calling this a greeting function
and I'm passing in an argument this

206
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:34,530  
and I'm passing in an argument this
 

207
00:05:34,530 --> 00:05:38,300  
and I'm passing in an argument this
argument is called greeting and when I

208
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:38,310  
argument is called greeting and when I
 

209
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:39,890  
argument is called greeting and when I
called the function here on line five

210
00:05:39,890 --> 00:05:39,900  
called the function here on line five
 

211
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:42,920  
called the function here on line five
this string gets passed to this greeting

212
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:42,930  
this string gets passed to this greeting
 

213
00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:45,469  
this string gets passed to this greeting
placeholder and now we're logging out a

214
00:05:45,469 --> 00:05:45,479  
placeholder and now we're logging out a
 

215
00:05:45,479 --> 00:05:49,820  
placeholder and now we're logging out a
greeting so if I save go back and

216
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:49,830  
greeting so if I save go back and
 

217
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:55,100  
greeting so if I save go back and
refresh okay I see that now and and I

218
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:55,110  
refresh okay I see that now and and I
 

219
00:05:55,110 --> 00:05:58,870  
refresh okay I see that now and and I
can actually do something like this I

220
00:05:58,870 --> 00:05:58,880  
can actually do something like this I
 

221
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:02,830  
can actually do something like this I
can use addition with strings to join

222
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:02,840  
can use addition with strings to join
 

223
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:10,610  
can use addition with strings to join
several strings together I save that if

224
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:10,620  
several strings together I save that if
 

225
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:13,909  
several strings together I save that if
I go back refresh there we go that's

226
00:06:13,909 --> 00:06:13,919  
I go back refresh there we go that's
 

227
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:16,659  
I go back refresh there we go that's
pretty cool and I can call this function

228
00:06:16,659 --> 00:06:16,669  
pretty cool and I can call this function
 

229
00:06:16,669 --> 00:06:20,409  
pretty cool and I can call this function
many different times so say greeting

230
00:06:20,409 --> 00:06:20,419  
many different times so say greeting
 

231
00:06:20,419 --> 00:06:25,219  
many different times so say greeting
let's use Spanish hola and let's call it

232
00:06:25,219 --> 00:06:25,229  
let's use Spanish hola and let's call it
 

233
00:06:25,229 --> 00:06:29,740  
let's use Spanish hola and let's call it
one more time let's use the German hello

and we'll make it say Korean so on dumb
 

239
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:43,450  
and we'll make it say Korean so on dumb

alright gonna save and go back to my
browser refresh well that's pretty cool

242
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:46,910  
browser refresh well that's pretty cool
 

243
00:06:46,910 --> 00:06:48,850  
browser refresh well that's pretty cool
so we have hello free code camp

244
00:06:48,850 --> 00:06:48,860  
so we have hello free code camp
 

245
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:51,280  
so we have hello free code camp
hola free code cap lo free code camp on

246
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:51,290  
hola free code cap lo free code camp on
 

247
00:06:51,290 --> 00:06:54,430  
hola free code cap lo free code camp on
young free code camp all right

248
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:54,440  
young free code camp all right
 

249
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:56,950  
young free code camp all right
so our function is pretty basic it's

250
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:56,960  
so our function is pretty basic it's
 

251
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:59,080  
so our function is pretty basic it's
only doing one thing it's logging out a

252
00:06:59,080 --> 00:06:59,090  
only doing one thing it's logging out a
 

253
00:06:59,090 --> 00:07:01,750  
only doing one thing it's logging out a
simple message to the console and that's

254
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:01,760  
simple message to the console and that's
 

255
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:04,719  
simple message to the console and that's
it it's not returning any values and

256
00:07:04,719 --> 00:07:04,729  
it it's not returning any values and
 

257
00:07:04,729 --> 00:07:07,390  
it it's not returning any values and
when you normally write functions they

258
00:07:07,390 --> 00:07:07,400  
when you normally write functions they
 

259
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:10,360  
when you normally write functions they
normally return a value when you do the

260
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:10,370  
normally return a value when you do the
 

261
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:12,580  
normally return a value when you do the
algorithm challenges at free code camp

262
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:12,590  
algorithm challenges at free code camp
 

263
00:07:12,590 --> 00:07:15,430  
algorithm challenges at free code camp
they have to return values or they won't

264
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:15,440  
they have to return values or they won't
 

265
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:20,440  
they have to return values or they won't
work so let's do a completely different

266
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:20,450  
work so let's do a completely different
 

267
00:07:20,450 --> 00:07:26,860  
work so let's do a completely different
function let's call it function add two

268
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:26,870  
function let's call it function add two
 

269
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:30,850  
function let's call it function add two
numbers all right I'm gonna give it two

270
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:30,860  
numbers all right I'm gonna give it two
 

271
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:34,600  
numbers all right I'm gonna give it two
arguments a comma B so if we have

272
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:34,610  
arguments a comma B so if we have
 

273
00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:36,850  
arguments a comma B so if we have
multiple arguments for a function we

274
00:07:36,850 --> 00:07:36,860  
multiple arguments for a function we
 

275
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:38,920  
multiple arguments for a function we
just separated with a comma very simple

276
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:38,930  
just separated with a comma very simple
 

277
00:07:38,930 --> 00:07:42,850  
just separated with a comma very simple
we need the curly braces alright and I'm

278
00:07:42,850 --> 00:07:42,860  
we need the curly braces alright and I'm
 

279
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:52,290  
we need the curly braces alright and I'm
gonna say a plus B comma and two numbers

280
00:07:52,290 --> 00:07:52,300  
gonna say a plus B comma and two numbers
 

281
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:58,990  
gonna say a plus B comma and two numbers
let's add five and three yeah let's save

282
00:07:58,990 --> 00:07:59,000  
let's add five and three yeah let's save
 

283
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:09,219  
let's add five and three yeah let's save
this okay and we get nothing right well

284
00:08:09,219 --> 00:08:09,229  
this okay and we get nothing right well
 

285
00:08:09,229 --> 00:08:12,719  
this okay and we get nothing right well
let's let's save this in a variable or

286
00:08:12,719 --> 00:08:12,729  
let's let's save this in a variable or
 

287
00:08:12,729 --> 00:08:20,440  
let's let's save this in a variable or
some so now we've got the variable it's

288
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:20,450  
some so now we've got the variable it's
 

289
00:08:20,450 --> 00:08:22,839  
some so now we've got the variable it's
equal to the value of this function and

290
00:08:22,839 --> 00:08:22,849  
equal to the value of this function and
 

291
00:08:22,849 --> 00:08:27,100  
equal to the value of this function and
let's log out the variable console dot

292
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:27,110  
let's log out the variable console dot
 

293
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:33,930  
let's log out the variable console dot
log some I'm gonna save that refresh it

294
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:33,940  
log some I'm gonna save that refresh it
 

295
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:37,779  
log some I'm gonna save that refresh it
wait a second undefined ah we have an

296
00:08:37,779 --> 00:08:37,789  
wait a second undefined ah we have an
 

297
00:08:37,789 --> 00:08:41,050  
wait a second undefined ah we have an
error okay the reason why we're getting

298
00:08:41,050 --> 00:08:41,060  
error okay the reason why we're getting
 

299
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:44,019  
error okay the reason why we're getting
undefined is because we did not include

300
00:08:44,019 --> 00:08:44,029  
undefined is because we did not include
 

301
00:08:44,029 --> 00:08:51,270  
undefined is because we did not include
a return statement in our code okay so

302
00:08:51,270 --> 00:08:51,280  
 
 

303
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:54,090  
 
all we have to do is use the return

304
00:08:54,090 --> 00:08:54,100  
all we have to do is use the return
 

305
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:57,330  
all we have to do is use the return
keyword and now our code should work

306
00:08:57,330 --> 00:08:57,340  
keyword and now our code should work
 

307
00:08:57,340 --> 00:08:59,660  
keyword and now our code should work
oops

308
00:08:59,660 --> 00:08:59,670  
oops
 

309
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:02,840  
oops
let's try this again

310
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:02,850  
let's try this again
 

311
00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:06,390  
let's try this again
okay now we get the number 8 5 plus 3

312
00:09:06,390 --> 00:09:06,400  
okay now we get the number 8 5 plus 3
 

313
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:09,330  
okay now we get the number 8 5 plus 3
equals 8 so our function is working just

314
00:09:09,330 --> 00:09:09,340  
equals 8 so our function is working just
 

315
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:14,640  
equals 8 so our function is working just
okay all right so the reason why I got

316
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:14,650  
okay all right so the reason why I got
 

317
00:09:14,650 --> 00:09:17,490  
okay all right so the reason why I got
an undefined okay

318
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:17,500  
an undefined okay
 

319
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:21,420  
an undefined okay
undefined is when variables have no

320
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:21,430  
undefined is when variables have no
 

321
00:09:21,430 --> 00:09:24,870  
undefined is when variables have no
value so I got undefined because I

322
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:24,880  
value so I got undefined because I
 

323
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:27,870  
value so I got undefined because I
declared a variable sum and I logged the

324
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:27,880  
declared a variable sum and I logged the
 

325
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:31,650  
declared a variable sum and I logged the
value of the variable sum right here but

326
00:09:31,650 --> 00:09:31,660  
value of the variable sum right here but
 

327
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:33,690  
value of the variable sum right here but
because my function didn't have a return

328
00:09:33,690 --> 00:09:33,700  
because my function didn't have a return
 

329
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:36,510  
because my function didn't have a return
statement my variable didn't have any

330
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:36,520  
statement my variable didn't have any
 

331
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:39,290  
statement my variable didn't have any
value and so the console showed

332
00:09:39,290 --> 00:09:39,300  
value and so the console showed
 

333
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:43,560  
value and so the console showed
undefined just get out of that stuff

334
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:43,570  
undefined just get out of that stuff
 

335
00:09:43,570 --> 00:09:50,970  
undefined just get out of that stuff
right here okay so if I go back to my

336
00:09:50,970 --> 00:09:50,980  
right here okay so if I go back to my
 

337
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:55,440  
right here okay so if I go back to my
editor and save that do it again all

338
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:55,450  
editor and save that do it again all
 

339
00:09:55,450 --> 00:09:57,060  
editor and save that do it again all
right I'm gonna get done defined and

340
00:09:57,060 --> 00:09:57,070  
right I'm gonna get done defined and
 

341
00:09:57,070 --> 00:10:00,090  
right I'm gonna get done defined and
most good editors Adam it does it's

342
00:10:00,090 --> 00:10:00,100  
most good editors Adam it does it's
 

343
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:02,240  
most good editors Adam it does it's
gonna give you an error it's gonna say

344
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:02,250  
gonna give you an error it's gonna say
 

345
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:06,720  
gonna give you an error it's gonna say
something like this all right we just

346
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:06,730  
something like this all right we just
 

347
00:10:06,730 --> 00:10:10,170  
something like this all right we just
need a return statement so the return

348
00:10:10,170 --> 00:10:10,180  
need a return statement so the return
 

349
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:14,370  
need a return statement so the return
statement it it gives a value right here

350
00:10:14,370 --> 00:10:14,380  
statement it it gives a value right here
 

351
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:17,250  
statement it it gives a value right here
and this is a variable assignment so now

352
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:17,260  
and this is a variable assignment so now
 

353
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:23,160  
and this is a variable assignment so now
sum is equal to a plus B or 5 plus 3 in

354
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:23,170  
sum is equal to a plus B or 5 plus 3 in
 

355
00:10:23,170 --> 00:10:26,550  
sum is equal to a plus B or 5 plus 3 in
this case alright so if we save that go

356
00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:26,560  
this case alright so if we save that go
 

357
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:30,690  
this case alright so if we save that go
back to the browser now it works one

358
00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:30,700  
back to the browser now it works one
 

359
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:33,240  
back to the browser now it works one
more important thing to note everything

360
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:33,250  
more important thing to note everything
 

361
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:37,110  
more important thing to note everything
after a return statement will not

362
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:37,120  
after a return statement will not
 

363
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:41,990  
after a return statement will not
execute so if I write a console dot log

364
00:10:41,990 --> 00:10:42,000  
execute so if I write a console dot log
 

365
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:49,470  
execute so if I write a console dot log
ok this will run I'm going to do another

366
00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:49,480  
ok this will run I'm going to do another
 

367
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:52,980  
ok this will run I'm going to do another
one and after the return statement this

368
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:52,990  
one and after the return statement this
 

369
00:10:52,990 --> 00:10:59,600  
one and after the return statement this
will not run

370
00:10:59,600 --> 00:10:59,610  
 
 

371
00:10:59,610 --> 00:11:03,240  
 
okay so what do you think will happen

372
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:03,250  
okay so what do you think will happen
 

373
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:06,270  
okay so what do you think will happen
when we save this and refresh the

374
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:06,280  
when we save this and refresh the
 

375
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:08,070  
when we save this and refresh the
browser what do you think you will see

376
00:11:08,070 --> 00:11:08,080  
browser what do you think you will see
 

377
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:11,460  
browser what do you think you will see
how many lines will be in our consoles

378
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:11,470  
how many lines will be in our consoles
 

379
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:14,190  
how many lines will be in our consoles
well let's take a look so I saved the

380
00:11:14,190 --> 00:11:14,200  
well let's take a look so I saved the
 

381
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:17,990  
well let's take a look so I saved the
file I'm gonna go back to the browser

382
00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:18,000  
file I'm gonna go back to the browser
 

383
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:23,580  
file I'm gonna go back to the browser
okay I only got two lines I got this

384
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:23,590  
okay I only got two lines I got this
 

385
00:11:23,590 --> 00:11:27,060  
okay I only got two lines I got this
will run and the number eight but wait a

386
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:27,070  
will run and the number eight but wait a
 

387
00:11:27,070 --> 00:11:27,740  
will run and the number eight but wait a
second

388
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:27,750  
second
 

389
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:31,040  
second
why didn't this get printed well

390
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:31,050  
why didn't this get printed well
 

391
00:11:31,050 --> 00:11:33,360  
why didn't this get printed well
remember what I said just a moment ago

392
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:33,370  
remember what I said just a moment ago
 

393
00:11:33,370 --> 00:11:37,110  
remember what I said just a moment ago
everything after a return statement will

394
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:37,120  
everything after a return statement will
 

395
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:39,780  
everything after a return statement will
not get run the function immediately

396
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:39,790  
not get run the function immediately
 

397
00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:45,030  
not get run the function immediately
stops and it returns a plus B here and

398
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:45,040  
stops and it returns a plus B here and
 

399
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:47,850  
stops and it returns a plus B here and
it gets assigned to some so when the

400
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:47,860  
it gets assigned to some so when the
 

401
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:50,940  
it gets assigned to some so when the
JavaScript interpreter runs this code it

402
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:50,950  
JavaScript interpreter runs this code it
 

403
00:11:50,950 --> 00:11:54,150  
JavaScript interpreter runs this code it
says okay function function function all

404
00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:54,160  
says okay function function function all
 

405
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:57,270  
says okay function function function all
right here's a variable let's make the

406
00:11:57,270 --> 00:11:57,280  
right here's a variable let's make the
 

407
00:11:57,280 --> 00:12:01,290  
right here's a variable let's make the
variable let's assign it a value the

408
00:12:01,290 --> 00:12:01,300  
variable let's assign it a value the
 

409
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:05,430  
variable let's assign it a value the
value will be the function with these

410
00:12:05,430 --> 00:12:05,440  
value will be the function with these
 

411
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:08,160  
value will be the function with these
arguments so we call the function we

412
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:08,170  
arguments so we call the function we
 

413
00:12:08,170 --> 00:12:12,360  
arguments so we call the function we
pass in 5 for a and 3 for B we're gonna

414
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:12,370  
pass in 5 for a and 3 for B we're gonna
 

415
00:12:12,370 --> 00:12:15,540  
pass in 5 for a and 3 for B we're gonna
print this to the console and we're

416
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:15,550  
print this to the console and we're
 

417
00:12:15,550 --> 00:12:19,230  
print this to the console and we're
gonna return these values returned a + 3

418
00:12:19,230 --> 00:12:19,240  
gonna return these values returned a + 3
 

419
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:25,160  
gonna return these values returned a + 3
8 plus B or 5 + 3 and that's 8 so sum is

420
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:25,170  
8 plus B or 5 + 3 and that's 8 so sum is
 

421
00:12:25,170 --> 00:12:30,900  
8 plus B or 5 + 3 and that's 8 so sum is
now equal to 8 and we print the value of

422
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:30,910  
now equal to 8 and we print the value of
 

423
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:33,210  
now equal to 8 and we print the value of
this variable right here so that's why

424
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:33,220  
this variable right here so that's why
 

425
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:37,110  
this variable right here so that's why
in our console over here we get this

426
00:12:37,110 --> 00:12:37,120  
in our console over here we get this
 

427
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:41,190  
in our console over here we get this
will run and the number 8 okay so that's

428
00:12:41,190 --> 00:12:41,200  
will run and the number 8 okay so that's
 

429
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,170  
will run and the number 8 okay so that's
all that I want to show you for this

430
00:12:43,170 --> 00:12:43,180  
all that I want to show you for this
