00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:26,580  
I'm confident that that's working at
least in a way that I expect then we can

158
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:26,590  
least in a way that I expect then we can
 

159
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:29,270  
least in a way that I expect then we can
go into building tests that are more

160
00:03:29,270 --> 00:03:29,280  
go into building tests that are more
 

161
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:33,000  
go into building tests that are more
thorough and and hopefully test against

162
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:33,010  
thorough and and hopefully test against
 

163
00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:34,500  
thorough and and hopefully test against
a pretty big surface area of the code

that's in this repo this is as much

that's in this repo this is as much

it may be a frustrating thing to watch
 

175
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:47,250  
it may be a frustrating thing to watch
but hopefully that's also entertaining

we're also going to update node Mon and

224
00:04:53,659 --> 00:04:53,669  
we're also going to update node Mon and
 

225
00:04:53,669 --> 00:04:55,749  
we're also going to update node Mon and
Express while we're at it

226
00:04:55,749 --> 00:04:55,759  
Express while we're at it

these all have fairly larger bumps that

228
00:05:00,439 --> 00:05:00,449  
these all have fairly larger bumps that
 

229
00:05:00,449 --> 00:05:01,909  
these all have fairly larger bumps that
probably won't be a big deal but I like

230
00:05:01,909 --> 00:05:01,919  
probably won't be a big deal but I like
 

231
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:05,779  
probably won't be a big deal but I like
to do the revision package updates first

232
00:05:05,779 --> 00:05:05,789  
to do the revision package updates first
 

233
00:05:05,789 --> 00:05:09,559  
to do the revision package updates first
so we're gonna do that it'll take a

234
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:09,569  
so we're gonna do that it'll take a
 

235
00:05:09,569 --> 00:05:11,149  
so we're gonna do that it'll take a
second install the new dependencies and

236
00:05:11,149 --> 00:05:11,159  
second install the new dependencies and
 

237
00:05:11,159 --> 00:05:13,610  
second install the new dependencies and
then we'll commit our changes after

238
00:05:13,610 --> 00:05:13,620  
then we'll commit our changes after
 

239
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:15,140  
then we'll commit our changes after
running this to make sure that

240
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:15,150  
running this to make sure that
 

241
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:21,040  
running this to make sure that
everything works still

242
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:21,050  
 
 

243
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:22,600  
 
so all this this is kind of a

244
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:22,610  
so all this this is kind of a
 

245
00:05:22,610 --> 00:05:27,879  
so all this this is kind of a
thoroughness of DevOps sort of it this

246
00:05:27,879 --> 00:05:27,889  
thoroughness of DevOps sort of it this
 

247
00:05:27,889 --> 00:05:29,290  
thoroughness of DevOps sort of it this
is a DevOps chore that you should

248
00:05:29,290 --> 00:05:29,300  
is a DevOps chore that you should
 

249
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:30,369  
is a DevOps chore that you should
probably get used to to if you're

250
00:05:30,369 --> 00:05:30,379  
probably get used to to if you're
 

251
00:05:30,379 --> 00:05:31,749  
probably get used to to if you're
building node projects just to make sure

252
00:05:31,749 --> 00:05:31,759  
building node projects just to make sure
 

253
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:33,309  
building node projects just to make sure
that dependencies are up-to-date if you

254
00:05:33,309 --> 00:05:33,319  
that dependencies are up-to-date if you
 

255
00:05:33,319 --> 00:05:34,510  
that dependencies are up-to-date if you
have something that's deployed it keeps

256
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:34,520  
have something that's deployed it keeps
 

257
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:36,459  
have something that's deployed it keeps
everything secure or as secure as it can

everything secure or as secure as it can
 

259
00:05:36,469 --> 00:05:38,709  
everything secure or as secure as it can
be when you're using someone else's code

260
00:05:38,709 --> 00:05:38,719  
be when you're using someone else's code
 

261

be when you're using someone else's code
there are a lot of hypothetical issues

262
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:41,210  
there are a lot of hypothetical issues
 

263
00:05:41,210 --> 00:05:42,549  
there are a lot of hypothetical issues
that can still come up if you do that

264
00:05:42,549 --> 00:05:42,559  
that can still come up if you do that
 

265
00:05:42,559 --> 00:05:45,579  
that can still come up if you do that
but for the sake of simplicity we'll use

00:05:45,579 --> 00:05:45,589  
but for the sake of simplicity we'll use

but for the sake of simplicity we'll use
this okay so it looks like this is still

277
00:05:54,199 --> 00:06:00,459  
doing to display stuff to me so I'm
going to commit some code here it looks

278
00:06:00,459 --> 00:06:00,469  
going to commit some code here it looks
 

279
00:06:00,469 --> 00:06:05,139  
going to commit some code here it looks
like there's a change but I didn't

280
00:06:05,139 --> 00:06:05,149  
like there's a change but I didn't
 

281
00:06:05,149 --> 00:06:07,110

that is a-okay we're gonna get rid of

284
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:12,649  
that is a-okay we're gonna get rid of
 

285
00:06:12,649 --> 00:06:18,800  
that is a-okay we're gonna get rid of
that console East

287
00:06:18,810 --> 00:06:22,589  
 
don't save my changes there so let's

288
00:06:22,589 --> 00:06:22,599  
don't save my changes there so let's
 

289
00:06:22,599 --> 00:06:24,629  
don't save my changes there so let's
make this big and the job listing

290
00:06:24,629 --> 00:06:24,639  
make this big and the job listing
 

291
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:27,779  
make this big and the job listing
there's a console print here that I

292
00:06:27,779 --> 00:06:27,789  
there's a console print here that I
 

293
00:06:27,789 --> 00:06:29,460  
there's a console print here that I
don't need to print any longer this is

294
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:29,470  
don't need to print any longer this is
 

295
00:06:29,470 --> 00:06:35,939  
don't need to print any longer this is
purely a debug tool just make sure that

I've only made some changes here that

298
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:37,930  
I've only made some changes here that
 

299
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:41,640  
I've only made some changes here that
looks like a okay yeah that's all from

300
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:41,650  
looks like a okay yeah that's all from
 

301
00:06:41,650 --> 00:06:44,159  
looks like a okay yeah that's all from
last time so I'm going to create a

00:06:44,159 --> 00:06:44,169  
last time so I'm going to create a
 

303
00:06:44,169 --> 00:06:50,520  
last time so I'm going to create a

that's a terrible commit then we're
 

311
00:07:02,650 --> 00:07:16,589  
that's a terrible commit then we're
gonna add

312
00:07:16,589 --> 00:07:16,599  
 
 

313
00:07:16,599 --> 00:07:26,010  
 
with new revisions on NPM great okay so

314

with new revisions on NPM great okay so
 

315
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:29,339  
with new revisions on NPM great okay so
we'll leave it at that for now this

316
00:07:29,339 --> 00:07:29,349  
we'll leave it at that for now this
 

317
00:07:29,349 --> 00:07:31,529  
we'll leave it at that for now this

should be broken here yeah it looks like

320
00:07:35,609 --> 00:07:35,619  
should be broken here yeah it looks like
 

321
00:07:35,619 --> 00:07:37,079  
should be broken here yeah it looks like
that's still running we can double

that's still running we can double
 

323
00:07:37,089 --> 00:07:39,119  
that's still running we can double
triple check that but this is gonna come

324
00:07:39,119 --> 00:07:39,129  
triple check that but this is gonna come
 

325
00:07:39,129 --> 00:07:41,609  
triple check that but this is gonna come
up still okay so now that we've updated

project we're going to write a very
simple test there are several different

332
00:07:47,519 --> 00:07:47,529  
simple test there are several different
 

333
00:07:47,529 --> 00:07:50,420  
simple test there are several different
ways you can write tests and just or

334
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:50,430  
ways you can write tests and just or
 

335
00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:52,230  
ways you can write tests and just or
what's better ready to say it there are

00:07:52,230 --> 00:07:52,240  
what's better ready to say it there are

00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,609  
what's better ready to say it there are
several different ways you can name your

343
00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:01,559  
can go with something that says dot SaaS
and just we'll know to look for that you

344
00:08:01,559 --> 00:08:01,569  
and just we'll know to look for that you
 

345
00:08:01,569 --> 00:08:04,109  
and just we'll know to look for that you
can also create I believe a directory at

346
00:08:04,109 --> 00:08:04,119  
can also create I believe a directory at
 

347
00:08:04,119 --> 00:08:07,320  
can also create I believe a directory at
the root of your project or I think

348
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:07,330  
the root of your project or I think
 

349
00:08:07,330 --> 00:08:08,489  
the root of your project or I think
actually in any directory of your

hundred scores on either side I don't
 

357
00:08:16,839 --> 00:08:19,199  
hundred scores on either side I don't
really have a preference but for the

358
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:19,209  
really have a preference but for the
 

359
00:08:19,209 --> 00:08:20,609  
really have a preference but for the
time being because this is such a small

360
00:08:20,609 --> 00:08:20,619  
time being because this is such a small
 

361
00:08:20,619 --> 00:08:21,989  
time being because this is such a small
project I'm just gonna put them next to

00:08:21,989 --> 00:08:21,999  
project I'm just gonna put them next to
 

363
00:08:21,999 --> 00:08:24,089  
project I'm just gonna put them next to
each other so we're gonna create a new

364
00:08:24,089 --> 00:08:24,099  
each other so we're gonna create a new
 

365
00:08:24,099 --> 00:08:26,850  
each other so we're gonna create a new
file here and it's gonna be job listing

366
00:08:26,850 --> 00:08:26,860  
file here and it's gonna be job listing
 

367
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:31,799  
file here and it's gonna be job listing
dot test J s there we go and we'll look

368
00:08:31,799 --> 00:08:31,809  
dot test J s there we go and we'll look
 

369
00:08:31,809 --> 00:08:34,319  
dot test J s there we go and we'll look
at how we can write a simple test case

370
00:08:34,319 --> 00:08:34,329  
at how we can write a simple test case
 

371
00:08:34,329 --> 00:08:38,189  
at how we can write a simple test case
here so first thing we have to do is go

372
00:08:38,189 --> 00:08:38,199  
here so first thing we have to do is go
 

373
00:08:38,199 --> 00:08:40,230  
here so first thing we have to do is go
into the package file and add this test

374
00:08:40,230 --> 00:08:40,240  
into the package file and add this test
 

375
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,459  
into the package file and add this test
script that we were talking about before

376
00:08:41,459 --> 00:08:41,469  
script that we were talking about before
 

377
00:08:41,469 --> 00:08:44,970  
script that we were talking about before
all it does is run just just being the

378
00:08:44,970 --> 00:08:44,980  
all it does is run just just being the
 

379
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:51,540  
all it does is run just just being the
test library here and we may have to do

380
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:51,550  
test library here and we may have to do
 

381
00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:54,620  
test library here and we may have to do
some magic to make sure that just is

382
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:54,630  
some magic to make sure that just is
 

383
00:08:54,630 --> 00:09:00,990  
some magic to make sure that just is
included by our transpiler here but a

384
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:01,000  
included by our transpiler here but a
 

385
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:05,400  
included by our transpiler here but a
very simple test is exactly this or

386
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:05,410  
very simple test is exactly this or
 

387
00:09:05,410 --> 00:09:07,679  
very simple test is exactly this or
something like this we could we could

388
00:09:07,679 --> 00:09:07,689  
something like this we could we could
 

389
00:09:07,689 --> 00:09:12,689  
something like this we could we could
write a stub function like that but here

390
00:09:12,689 --> 00:09:12,699  
write a stub function like that but here
 

391
00:09:12,699 --> 00:09:14,100  
write a stub function like that but here
let me maximize this so you can actually

392
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:14,110  
let me maximize this so you can actually
 

393
00:09:14,110 --> 00:09:16,679  
let me maximize this so you can actually
read so oh yeah here we go so we do need

394
00:09:16,679 --> 00:09:16,689  
read so oh yeah here we go so we do need
 

395
00:09:16,689 --> 00:09:22,019  
read so oh yeah here we go so we do need
to add some

396
00:09:22,019 --> 00:09:22,029

don't think I am Babel yeah okay so

404
00:09:34,509 --> 00:09:34,519  
don't think I am Babel yeah okay so
 

405
00:09:34,519 --> 00:09:36,189  
don't think I am Babel yeah okay so
don't forget to add a Babel our Senior

if I run just now in this directory
it'll look for test cases it'll probably

430
00:10:59,320 --> 00:10:59,330  
it'll look for test cases it'll probably
 

431
00:10:59,330 --> 00:11:00,760  
it'll look for test cases it'll probably
complain that there's no actual tests in

432
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:00,770  
complain that there's no actual tests in
 

433
00:11:00,770 --> 00:11:06,460  
complain that there's no actual tests in
that one test file if it finds it your

434
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:06,470  
that one test file if it finds it your
 

435
00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:07,660  
that one test file if it finds it your
test suite must contain at least one

436
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:07,670  
test suite must contain at least one
 

437
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:09,639  
test suite must contain at least one
test that's a good start though and so I

438
00:11:09,639 --> 00:11:09,649  
test that's a good start though and so I
 

439
00:11:09,649 --> 00:11:13,269  
test that's a good start though and so I
found the test file and so now we have

440
00:11:13,269 --> 00:11:13,279  
found the test file and so now we have
 

441
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:14,680  
found the test file and so now we have
to write a test so let's go to the

442
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:14,690  
to write a test so let's go to the
 

443
00:11:14,690 --> 00:11:27,340  
to write a test so let's go to the
actual docs for this

444
00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:27,350  
 
 

445
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:30,580  
 
create a file named some dye test IJ yes

446
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:30,590  
create a file named some dye test IJ yes
 

447
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:34,010  
create a file named some dye test IJ yes
did you do and the syntax takes a little

448
00:11:34,010 --> 00:11:34,020  
did you do and the syntax takes a little
 

449
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:35,390  
did you do and the syntax takes a little
bit to get used to but it's actually not

450
00:11:35,390 --> 00:11:35,400  
bit to get used to but it's actually not
 

451
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:37,390  
bit to get used to but it's actually not
too bad

452
00:11:37,390 --> 00:11:37,400  
too bad
 

453
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:42,080  
too bad
so in our file where we're gonna write

454
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:42,090  
so in our file where we're gonna write
 

455
00:11:42,090 --> 00:11:44,170  
so in our file where we're gonna write
the test case against this job listing

456
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:44,180  
the test case against this job listing
 

457
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:46,160  
the test case against this job listing
and to be honest this might not be a

458
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:46,170  
and to be honest this might not be a
 

459
00:11:46,170 --> 00:11:47,450  
and to be honest this might not be a
great place to start because this is

460
00:11:47,450 --> 00:11:47,460  
great place to start because this is
 

461
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:57,590  
great place to start because this is

what we can write against util first

464
00:11:59,330 --> 00:11:59,340  
what we can write against util first
 

465
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:02,450  
what we can write against util first
that's a nice easy one so in my source

466
00:12:02,450 --> 00:12:02,460  
that's a nice easy one so in my source
 

467
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:04,280  
that's a nice easy one so in my source
folder where this util is I'm gonna make

468
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:04,290  
folder where this util is I'm gonna make
 

469
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:07,280  
folder where this util is I'm gonna make
a u tilde test yes we'll come back to

470
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:07,290  
a u tilde test yes we'll come back to
 

471
00:12:07,290 --> 00:12:13,970  
a u tilde test yes we'll come back to
this job listing test in a bit and we're

472
00:12:13,970 --> 00:12:13,980  
this job listing test in a bit and we're
 

473
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:15,410  
this job listing test in a bit and we're
going to the first test we're going to

474
00:12:15,410 --> 00:12:15,420  
going to the first test we're going to
 

475
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:16,850  
going to the first test we're going to
write is against this distance between

476
00:12:16,850 --> 00:12:16,860  
write is against this distance between
 

477
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:19,790  
write is against this distance between
two points function it shouldn't be too

478
00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:19,800  
two points function it shouldn't be too
 

479
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:27,250  
two points function it shouldn't be too
hard so

480
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:27,260  
 
 

481
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:34,600  
 
this is what tests look like for jest

482
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:34,610  
this is what tests look like for jest
 

483
00:12:34,610 --> 00:12:42,850  
this is what tests look like for jest
we're gonna say expect right import

484
00:12:42,850 --> 00:12:42,860  
 
 

485
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:44,120  
 
right

486
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:44,130  
right
 

487
00:12:44,130 --> 00:13:06,970  
right
Const utils equals require you to

488
00:13:06,970 --> 00:13:06,980  
 
 

489
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:09,770  
 
till dot who I don't actually export it

490
00:13:09,770 --> 00:13:09,780  
till dot who I don't actually export it
 

491
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:21,570  
till dot who I don't actually export it
we're gonna export it so we can test it

492
00:13:21,570 --> 00:13:21,580  
 
 

493
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:23,800  
 
okay

494
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:23,810  
okay
 

495
00:13:23,810 --> 00:13:26,030  
okay
so we'll test the distance between two

496
00:13:26,030 --> 00:13:26,040  
so we'll test the distance between two
 

497
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:33,559  
so we'll test the distance between two
points function and this is kind of what

498
00:13:33,559 --> 00:13:33,569  
points function and this is kind of what
 

499
00:13:33,569 --> 00:13:34,939  
points function and this is kind of what
the syntax looks like so we have this

500
00:13:34,939 --> 00:13:34,949  
the syntax looks like so we have this
 

501
00:13:34,949 --> 00:13:37,540  
the syntax looks like so we have this
expect and then there's this to be

502
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:37,550  
expect and then there's this to be
 

503
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:39,879  
expect and then there's this to be
syntax that can go after it

504
00:13:39,879 --> 00:13:39,889  
syntax that can go after it
 

505
00:13:39,889 --> 00:13:42,230  
syntax that can go after it
and this is where we expect the result

506
00:13:42,230 --> 00:13:42,240  
and this is where we expect the result
 

507
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:48,920  
and this is where we expect the result
to happen so mmm my winter is

508
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:48,930  
to happen so mmm my winter is
 

509

00:14:09,290 --> 00:14:09,300  
is lint tests plugin no I think it's
 

515
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:29,360

517
00:14:29,370 --> 00:14:31,850  
 
okay now this is hopefully not

518
00:14:31,850 --> 00:14:31,860  
okay now this is hopefully not
 

519
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:34,360  
okay now this is hopefully not
complaining about that any longer

520
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:34,370  
complaining about that any longer
 

521
00:14:34,370 --> 00:14:44,240  
complaining about that any longer
it still is hmm I'll have to figure that

522
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:44,250  
it still is hmm I'll have to figure that
 

523
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:53,570  
it still is hmm I'll have to figure that
out a bit later on so let's go back to

524
00:14:53,570 --> 00:14:53,580  
out a bit later on so let's go back to
 

525
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:56,240  
out a bit later on so let's go back to
that actual test script and we're gonna

526
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:56,250  
that actual test script and we're gonna
 

527
00:14:56,250 --> 00:15:04,550  
that actual test script and we're gonna
create two points now we're gonna say so

528
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:04,560  
create two points now we're gonna say so
 

529
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:05,930  
create two points now we're gonna say so
I need to figure out what the inputs for

530
00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:05,940  
I need to figure out what the inputs for
 

531
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:07,940  
I need to figure out what the inputs for
this function should be which is a sign

532
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:07,950  
this function should be which is a sign
 

533
00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:11,510  
this function should be which is a sign
that I have done a poor job of

534
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:11,520  
that I have done a poor job of
 

535
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:14,470  
that I have done a poor job of
documenting this because that should be

536
00:15:14,470 --> 00:15:14,480  
documenting this because that should be
 

537
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:17,570  
documenting this because that should be
obvious they should have a dot latitude

538
00:15:17,570 --> 00:15:17,580  
obvious they should have a dot latitude
 

539
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:19,220  
obvious they should have a dot latitude
and longitude so let's write a little

540
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:19,230  
and longitude so let's write a little
 

541
00:15:19,230 --> 00:15:26,960  
and longitude so let's write a little
comment here position one let's see the

542
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:26,970  
comment here position one let's see the
 

543
00:15:26,970 --> 00:15:32,740  
comment here position one let's see the
position object we're in the form

544
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:32,750  
 
 

545
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:39,140  
 
latitude longitude there's probably a

546
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:39,150  
latitude longitude there's probably a
 

547
00:15:39,150 --> 00:15:40,730  
latitude longitude there's probably a
better way to write this taking

548
00:15:40,730 --> 00:15:40,740  
better way to write this taking
 

549
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:45,530  
better way to write this taking

553
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:48,470  
stock has to offer but I'm not really an
expert on that either

554
00:15:48,470 --> 00:15:48,480  
expert on that either

distance between two points given to two

558
00:15:58,750 --> 00:15:58,760  
distance between two points given to two
 

559
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:02,990  
distance between two points given to two
geographic points and this is a

560
00:16:02,990 --> 00:16:03,000  
geographic points and this is a
 

561
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:12,290  
geographic points and this is a
Cartesian

562
00:16:12,290 --> 00:16:12,300  
 
 

563
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:16,949  
 
okay so now there's a whole notion of

564
00:16:16,949 --> 00:16:16,959  
okay so now there's a whole notion of
 

565
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:17,999  
okay so now there's a whole notion of
something called test-driven development

566
00:16:17,999 --> 00:16:18,009  
something called test-driven development
 

567
00:16:18,009 --> 00:16:19,860  
something called test-driven development
where you write the test cases first and

568
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:19,870  
where you write the test cases first and
 

569
00:16:19,870 --> 00:16:21,389  
where you write the test cases first and
then make your code function against

570
00:16:21,389 --> 00:16:21,399  
then make your code function against
 

571
00:16:21,399 --> 00:16:23,189  
then make your code function against
those test cases which is a smart thing

572
00:16:23,189 --> 00:16:23,199  
those test cases which is a smart thing
 

573
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:25,800  
those test cases which is a smart thing
to do in part because a lot of the times

574
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:25,810  
to do in part because a lot of the times
 

575
00:16:25,810 --> 00:16:27,809  
to do in part because a lot of the times
if you go and rate the tests after the

576
00:16:27,809 --> 00:16:27,819  
if you go and rate the tests after the
 

577
00:16:27,819 --> 00:16:29,340  
if you go and rate the tests after the
fact it's really easy to write tests

578
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:29,350  
fact it's really easy to write tests
 

579
00:16:29,350 --> 00:16:31,590  
fact it's really easy to write tests
that pass no matter what so for example

580
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:31,600  
that pass no matter what so for example
 

581
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,329  
that pass no matter what so for example
I might write distance between two

582
00:16:33,329 --> 00:16:33,339  
I might write distance between two
 

583
00:16:33,339 --> 00:16:36,420  
I might write distance between two
points for where I live in Charlotte in

584
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:36,430  
points for where I live in Charlotte in
 

585
00:16:36,430 --> 00:16:38,189  
points for where I live in Charlotte in
New York City run the calculation myself

586
00:16:38,189 --> 00:16:38,199  
New York City run the calculation myself
 

587
00:16:38,199 --> 00:16:41,460  
New York City run the calculation myself
and write one test case for that which

588
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:41,470  
and write one test case for that which
 

589
00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:43,259  
and write one test case for that which
would look something like this

590
00:16:43,259 --> 00:16:43,269  
would look something like this
 

591
00:16:43,269 --> 00:16:51,920  
would look something like this
Const Charlotte position equals latitude

592
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:51,930  
Const Charlotte position equals latitude
 

593
00:16:51,930 --> 00:16:54,170  
Const Charlotte position equals latitude
figure out what that should be

594
00:16:54,170 --> 00:16:54,180  
figure out what that should be
 

595
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:57,900  
figure out what that should be
longitude figure out what that should be

596
00:16:57,900 --> 00:16:57,910  
longitude figure out what that should be
 

597
00:16:57,910 --> 00:16:59,610  
longitude figure out what that should be
and we'll get the actual distance

598
00:16:59,610 --> 00:16:59,620  
and we'll get the actual distance
 

599
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:19,050  
and we'll get the actual distance
between these two points

600
00:17:19,050 --> 00:17:19,060  
 
 

601
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:27,530  
 
okay so

602
00:17:27,530 --> 00:17:27,540  
 
 

603
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:29,720  
 
in this case it's really easy to write

604
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:29,730  
in this case it's really easy to write
 

605
00:17:29,730 --> 00:17:33,350  
in this case it's really easy to write
this test to be zero because I haven't

606
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:33,360  
this test to be zero because I haven't
 

607
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:34,910  
this test to be zero because I haven't
actually defined any latitude and

608
00:17:34,910 --> 00:17:34,920  
actually defined any latitude and
 

609
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:36,830  
actually defined any latitude and
longitude points for either of them we

610
00:17:36,830 --> 00:17:36,840  
longitude points for either of them we
 

611
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:38,750  
longitude points for either of them we
can run this test and it will probably

612
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:38,760  
can run this test and it will probably
 

613
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:43,310  
can run this test and it will probably
pass yeah look at that

614
00:17:43,310 --> 00:17:43,320  
pass yeah look at that
 

615
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:45,020  
pass yeah look at that
it passed even though those aren't

616
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:45,030  
it passed even though those aren't
 

617
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:49,250  
it passed even though those aren't
really valid points it will work right

618
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:49,260  
really valid points it will work right
 

619
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:50,780  
really valid points it will work right
this is technically a functioning test

620
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:50,790  
this is technically a functioning test
 

621
00:17:50,790 --> 00:17:54,560  
this is technically a functioning test
case we do have in here this constants

622
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:54,570  
case we do have in here this constants
 

623
00:17:54,570 --> 00:17:56,710  
case we do have in here this constants
file which has all these markets in it

624
00:17:56,710 --> 00:17:56,720  
file which has all these markets in it
 

625
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:02,090  
file which has all these markets in it
which is lovely so we're actually going

626
00:18:02,090 --> 00:18:02,100  
which is lovely so we're actually going
 

627
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:07,250  
which is lovely so we're actually going
to import and poor sorry coasts markets

628
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:07,260  
to import and poor sorry coasts markets
 

629
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:14,210  
to import and poor sorry coasts markets
equals require and we'll grab our

630
00:18:14,210 --> 00:18:14,220  
equals require and we'll grab our
 

631
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:17,660  
equals require and we'll grab our
constants and hopefully that has markets

632
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:17,670  
constants and hopefully that has markets
 

633
00:18:17,670 --> 00:18:20,470  
constants and hopefully that has markets
define that it hasn't defined this site

634
00:18:20,470 --> 00:18:20,480  
define that it hasn't defined this site
 

635
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:23,500  
define that it hasn't defined this site
and instead of this we're gonna say

636
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:23,510  
and instead of this we're gonna say
 

637
00:18:23,510 --> 00:18:31,720  
and instead of this we're gonna say
markets will get the ID for Charlotte

638
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:31,730  
markets will get the ID for Charlotte
 

639
00:18:31,730 --> 00:18:39,920  
markets will get the ID for Charlotte
61 Ward's and we'll do the same thing

640
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:39,930  
61 Ward's and we'll do the same thing
 

641
00:18:39,930 --> 00:18:43,430  
61 Ward's and we'll do the same thing
for New York City and we're gonna kind

642
00:18:43,430 --> 00:18:43,440  
for New York City and we're gonna kind
 

643
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:51,470  
for New York City and we're gonna kind
of back our way into this

644
00:18:51,470 --> 00:18:51,480  
 
 

645
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:55,260  
 
eleven

646
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:55,270  
 
 

647
00:18:55,270 --> 00:18:58,360  
 
there we go

648
00:18:58,360 --> 00:18:58,370  
 
 

649
00:18:58,370 --> 00:19:01,010  
 
so now this test will fail because I

650
00:19:01,010 --> 00:19:01,020  
so now this test will fail because I
 

651
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:07,010  
so now this test will fail because I
have actual distances in there so what

652
00:19:07,010 --> 00:19:07,020  
have actual distances in there so what
 

653
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:09,020  
have actual distances in there so what
this is saying is the distance is

654
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:09,030  
this is saying is the distance is
 

655
00:19:09,030 --> 00:19:11,870  
this is saying is the distance is
expected to be zero but it got eight

656
00:19:11,870 --> 00:19:11,880  
expected to be zero but it got eight
 

657
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:14,360  
expected to be zero but it got eight
point seven six which is a funny value

658
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:14,370  
point seven six which is a funny value
 

659
00:19:14,370 --> 00:19:19,730  
point seven six which is a funny value
still but that is a distance in latitude

660
00:19:19,730 --> 00:19:19,740  
still but that is a distance in latitude
 

661
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:21,050  
still but that is a distance in latitude
and longitude right that's not actually

662
00:19:21,050 --> 00:19:21,060  
and longitude right that's not actually
 

663
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:22,730  
and longitude right that's not actually
miles or anything like that this hasn't

664
00:19:22,730 --> 00:19:22,740  
miles or anything like that this hasn't
 

665
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:29,210  
miles or anything like that this hasn't
been converted but basically what I'm

666
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:29,220  
been converted but basically what I'm
 

667
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:30,770  
been converted but basically what I'm
gonna do is work my test case backwards

668
00:19:30,770 --> 00:19:30,780  
gonna do is work my test case backwards
 

669
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:35,470  
gonna do is work my test case backwards
so I'm gonna say cons distance between

670
00:19:35,470 --> 00:19:35,480  
so I'm gonna say cons distance between
 

671
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:45,020  
so I'm gonna say cons distance between
Charlotte and NYC equals that look at

672
00:19:45,020 --> 00:19:45,030  
Charlotte and NYC equals that look at
 

673
00:19:45,030 --> 00:19:46,310  
Charlotte and NYC equals that look at
that suddenly I've got a working test

674
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:46,320  
that suddenly I've got a working test
 

675
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:49,280  
that suddenly I've got a working test
case again I'm sure actually it might

676
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:49,290  
case again I'm sure actually it might
 

677
00:19:49,290 --> 00:19:51,020  
case again I'm sure actually it might
not work in depending on rounding error

678
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:51,030  
not work in depending on rounding error
 

679
00:19:51,030 --> 00:19:55,340  
not work in depending on rounding error
oh yeah look it worked so I guess the

680
00:19:55,340 --> 00:19:55,350  
oh yeah look it worked so I guess the
 

681
00:19:55,350 --> 00:19:57,910  
oh yeah look it worked so I guess the
whole point of that exercise is that I

682
00:19:57,910 --> 00:19:57,920  
whole point of that exercise is that I
 

683
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:01,010  
whole point of that exercise is that I
wrote this test and the test works and

684
00:20:01,010 --> 00:20:01,020  
wrote this test and the test works and
 

685
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:05,860  
wrote this test and the test works and
it would be possible to submit this to

686
00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:05,870  
it would be possible to submit this to
 

687
00:20:05,870 --> 00:20:09,400  
it would be possible to submit this to
as a test case against this whole

688
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:09,410  
as a test case against this whole
 

689
00:20:09,410 --> 00:20:14,210  
as a test case against this whole
function to say that okay now the the

690
00:20:14,210 --> 00:20:14,220  
function to say that okay now the the
 

691
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:16,040  
function to say that okay now the the
the distance between two points function

692
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:16,050  
the distance between two points function
 

693
00:20:16,050 --> 00:20:18,890  
the distance between two points function
is tested and it's good to go but there

694
00:20:18,890 --> 00:20:18,900  
is tested and it's good to go but there
 

695
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:21,980  
is tested and it's good to go but there
are a number of ways in which this is

696
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:21,990  
are a number of ways in which this is
 

697
00:20:21,990 --> 00:20:26,510  
are a number of ways in which this is
lacking so all right we'll show you

698
00:20:26,510 --> 00:20:26,520  
lacking so all right we'll show you
 

699
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:27,530  
lacking so all right we'll show you
we're gonna write a couple more test

700
00:20:27,530 --> 00:20:27,540  
we're gonna write a couple more test
 

701
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:29,120  
we're gonna write a couple more test
cases and I'll explain why this is not

702
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:29,130  
cases and I'll explain why this is not
 

703
00:20:29,130 --> 00:20:39,819  
cases and I'll explain why this is not
sufficient okay so

704
00:20:39,819 --> 00:20:39,829  
 
 

705
00:20:39,829 --> 00:20:41,839  
 
one of the things I'm not currently

706
00:20:41,839 --> 00:20:41,849  
one of the things I'm not currently
 

707
00:20:41,849 --> 00:20:43,009  
one of the things I'm not currently
happy with is I know there's a way to

708
00:20:43,009 --> 00:20:43,019  
happy with is I know there's a way to
 

709
00:20:43,019 --> 00:20:45,199  
happy with is I know there's a way to
write a whole suite of tests against one

710
00:20:45,199 --> 00:20:45,209  
write a whole suite of tests against one
 

711
00:20:45,209 --> 00:20:47,539  
write a whole suite of tests against one
thing that fall under the same name I

712
00:20:47,539 --> 00:20:47,549  
thing that fall under the same name I
 

713
00:20:47,549 --> 00:20:51,019  
thing that fall under the same name I
don't know what mattress is we're gonna

714
00:20:51,019 --> 00:20:51,029  
don't know what mattress is we're gonna
 

715
00:20:51,029 --> 00:21:06,980  
don't know what mattress is we're gonna
find out

716
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:06,990  
 
 

717
00:21:06,990 --> 00:21:08,360  
 
I'm just looking for a very specific

718
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:08,370  
I'm just looking for a very specific
 

719
00:21:08,370 --> 00:21:10,220  
I'm just looking for a very specific
syntax I guess I could do it like this

720
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:10,230  
syntax I guess I could do it like this
 

721
00:21:10,230 --> 00:21:13,760  
syntax I guess I could do it like this
I'm yeah actually that's fine because

722
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:13,770  
I'm yeah actually that's fine because
 

723
00:21:13,770 --> 00:21:15,680  
I'm yeah actually that's fine because
it'll be grouped by the file so here I'm

724
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:15,690  
it'll be grouped by the file so here I'm
 

725
00:21:15,690 --> 00:21:17,030  
it'll be grouped by the file so here I'm
going to write another test case based

726
00:21:17,030 --> 00:21:17,040  
going to write another test case based
 

727
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:21,260  
going to write another test case based
on this we're gonna move these

728
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:21,270  
on this we're gonna move these
 

729
00:21:21,270 --> 00:21:23,690  
on this we're gonna move these
definitions up because we'll probably

730
00:21:23,690 --> 00:21:23,700  
definitions up because we'll probably
 

731
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:30,950  
definitions up because we'll probably
use them again it all is great so now

732
00:21:30,950 --> 00:21:30,960  
use them again it all is great so now
 

733
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,270  
use them again it all is great so now
I'm going to write another test based on

734
00:21:32,270 --> 00:21:32,280  
I'm going to write another test based on
 

735
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:34,790  
I'm going to write another test based on
this and we'll call we'll give this test

736
00:21:34,790 --> 00:21:34,800  
this and we'll call we'll give this test
 

737
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:44,120  
this and we'll call we'll give this test
a better name should return should be

738
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:44,130  
a better name should return should be
 

739
00:21:44,130 --> 00:21:52,190  
a better name should return should be
calculated accurately this one is going

740
00:21:52,190 --> 00:21:52,200  
calculated accurately this one is going
 

741
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:59,330  
calculated accurately this one is going
to be should return 0 if points are the

742
00:21:59,330 --> 00:21:59,340  
to be should return 0 if points are the
 

743
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:06,890  
to be should return 0 if points are the
same so this is another test case you

744
00:22:06,890 --> 00:22:06,900  
same so this is another test case you
 

745
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:09,080  
same so this is another test case you
might reasonably be expected to write

746
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:09,090  
might reasonably be expected to write
 

747
00:22:09,090 --> 00:22:11,960  
might reasonably be expected to write
make sure that if you're testing against

748
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:11,970  
make sure that if you're testing against
 

749
00:22:11,970 --> 00:22:13,460  
make sure that if you're testing against
to the same points they should be 0 they

750
00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:13,470  
to the same points they should be 0 they
 

751
00:22:13,470 --> 00:22:14,660  
to the same points they should be 0 they
shouldn't be null it shouldn't be false

752
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:14,670  
shouldn't be null it shouldn't be false
 

753
00:22:14,670 --> 00:22:19,630  
shouldn't be null it shouldn't be false
or anything like that but what about

754
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:19,640  
 
 

755
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:25,970  
 
should return an exception if only one

756
00:22:25,970 --> 00:22:25,980  
should return an exception if only one
 

757
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:31,040  
should return an exception if only one
point is provided so we're gonna write a

758
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:31,050  
point is provided so we're gonna write a
 

759
00:22:31,050 --> 00:22:34,760  
point is provided so we're gonna write a
test against that because you can't do

760
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:34,770  
test against that because you can't do
 

761
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:37,150  
test against that because you can't do
the distance between only one point so

762
00:22:37,150 --> 00:22:37,160  
the distance between only one point so
 

763
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:41,060  
the distance between only one point so
expect you till distance between points

764
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:41,070  
expect you till distance between points
 

765
00:22:41,070 --> 00:22:49,970  
expect you till distance between points
of Charlotte position null dot to throw

766
00:22:49,970 --> 00:22:49,980  
of Charlotte position null dot to throw
 

767
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:56,419  
of Charlotte position null dot to throw
two two

768
00:22:56,419 --> 00:22:56,429  
 
 

769
00:22:56,429 --> 00:22:59,030  
 
so there's specific function for

770
00:22:59,030 --> 00:22:59,040  
so there's specific function for
 

771
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:05,480  
so there's specific function for
exceptions here that function syntax is

772
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:05,490  
exceptions here that function syntax is
 

773
00:23:05,490 --> 00:23:09,620  
exceptions here that function syntax is
what I'm looking for so Row two throwing

774
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:09,630  
what I'm looking for so Row two throwing
 

775
00:23:09,630 --> 00:23:18,799  
what I'm looking for so Row two throwing
it okay to throw and this is also a

776
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:18,809

if those positions actually exist so I'm
 

801
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:47,690  
if those positions actually exist so I'm
going to actually write a test case

00:23:47,690 --> 00:23:47,700  
going to actually write a test case
 

803
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:49,970  
going to actually write a test case
against both of those which would be

00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:49,980  
against both of those which would be
 

805
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:55,880

this it's the row thoreau and so now in

00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:55,890  
this it's the row thoreau and so now in
 

807
00:23:55,890 --> 00:23:57,020  
this it's the row thoreau and so now in
the spirit of sort of test-driven

808
00:23:57,020 --> 00:23:57,030  
the spirit of sort of test-driven
 

809
00:23:57,030 --> 00:23:59,630  
the spirit of sort of test-driven
development these would have been

810
00:23:59,630 --> 00:23:59,640  
development these would have been
 

811
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:01,549  
development these would have been
written first and then I would have gone

812
00:24:01,549 --> 00:24:01,559  
written first and then I would have gone
 

813
00:24:01,559 --> 00:24:02,659  
written first and then I would have gone
and written a function that would work

814
00:24:02,659 --> 00:24:02,669  
and written a function that would work
 

815
00:24:02,669 --> 00:24:05,900  
and written a function that would work
against them because we're kind of

816
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:05,910  
against them because we're kind of
 

817
00:24:05,910 --> 00:24:07,460  
against them because we're kind of
backing our way into this which is maybe

818
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:07,470  
backing our way into this which is maybe
 

819
00:24:07,470 --> 00:24:08,750  
backing our way into this which is maybe
not the right way to do it if you're

820
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:08,760  
not the right way to do it if you're
 

821
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:11,780  
not the right way to do it if you're
being really traditional about it or

822
00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:11,790  
being really traditional about it or
 

823
00:24:11,790 --> 00:24:13,490  
being really traditional about it or
whatever you want to call it now I need

824
00:24:13,490 --> 00:24:13,500  
whatever you want to call it now I need
 

825
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:15,710  
whatever you want to call it now I need
to go and fix my code so this works and

826
00:24:15,710 --> 00:24:15,720  
to go and fix my code so this works and
 

827
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:19,880  
to go and fix my code so this works and
we'll do that presently so we're going

828
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:19,890  
we'll do that presently so we're going
 

829
00:24:19,890 --> 00:24:30,860  
we'll do that presently so we're going
to say if position 1

830
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:30,870  
 
 

831
00:24:30,870 --> 00:24:38,840  
 
or not position to we're gonna say throw

832
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:38,850  
or not position to we're gonna say throw
 

833
00:24:38,850 --> 00:24:49,909  
or not position to we're gonna say throw
new error to positions need to be

834
00:24:49,909 --> 00:24:49,919  
new error to positions need to be
 

835
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:53,810  
new error to positions need to be
provided to calculate a distance that's

00:24:53,810 --> 00:24:53,820  
provided to calculate a distance that's

a helpful message that will show up in

838
00:24:55,279 --> 00:24:55,289  
a helpful message that will show up in
 

839
00:24:55,289 --> 00:24:58,909  
a helpful message that will show up in
the console when that error happens so

840
00:24:58,909 --> 00:24:58,919  
the console when that error happens so
 

841
00:24:58,919 --> 00:25:04,820  
the console when that error happens so
let's see now it's already error to

842
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:04,830  
let's see now it's already error to
 

843
00:25:04,830 --> 00:25:13,129  
let's see now it's already error to
position their command failed oh oh yeah

844
00:25:13,129 --> 00:25:13,139  
position their command failed oh oh yeah
 

845
00:25:13,139 --> 00:25:17,749  
position their command failed oh oh yeah
okay well so I would sort of have

846
00:25:17,749 --> 00:25:17,759  
okay well so I would sort of have
 

847
00:25:17,759 --> 00:25:19,489  
okay well so I would sort of have
expected that to pass the test case

848
00:25:19,489 --> 00:25:19,499  
expected that to pass the test case
 

849
00:25:19,499 --> 00:25:23,269  
expected that to pass the test case
because it through an error maybe I need

850
00:25:23,269 --> 00:25:23,279  
because it through an error maybe I need
 

851
00:25:23,279 --> 00:25:24,889  
because it through an error maybe I need
to write that a little more specifically

852
00:25:24,889 --> 00:25:24,899  
to write that a little more specifically
 

853
00:25:24,899 --> 00:25:31,020  
to write that a little more specifically
let's take a look at this

854
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:31,030  
 
 

855
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:33,370  
 
when test the drink flavor octopus

856
00:25:33,370 --> 00:25:33,380  
when test the drink flavor octopus
 

857
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:46,870  
when test the drink flavor octopus
throws exact yeah so I actually would

858
00:25:46,870 --> 00:25:46,880  
throws exact yeah so I actually would
 

859
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:58,670  
throws exact yeah so I actually would
expect that to have worked

860
00:25:58,670 --> 00:25:58,680  
 
 

861
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:00,690  
 
let's see what's going on here maybe my

862
00:26:00,690 --> 00:26:00,700  
let's see what's going on here maybe my
 

863
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:03,630  
let's see what's going on here maybe my
syntax was incorrect I'm losing my voice

864
00:26:03,630 --> 00:26:03,640  
syntax was incorrect I'm losing my voice
 

865
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:08,960  
syntax was incorrect I'm losing my voice
again

866
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:08,970  
 
 

867
00:26:08,970 --> 00:26:16,550  
 
excuse me okay

868
00:26:16,550 --> 00:26:16,560  
 
 

869
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:19,050  
 
well tell you what rather than running

870
00:26:19,050 --> 00:26:19,060  
well tell you what rather than running
 

871
00:26:19,060 --> 00:26:21,630  
well tell you what rather than running
this in the test environment let's test

872
00:26:21,630 --> 00:26:21,640  
this in the test environment let's test
 

873
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:29,580  
this in the test environment let's test
it from the actual app itself and we're

874
00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:29,590  
it from the actual app itself and we're
 

875
00:26:29,590 --> 00:26:53,980  
it from the actual app itself and we're
just going to run here we're gonna say

876
00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:53,990  
 
 

877
00:26:53,990 --> 00:26:57,820  
 
and this is gonna be an object with a

878
00:26:57,820 --> 00:26:57,830  
and this is gonna be an object with a
 

879
00:26:57,830 --> 00:26:59,980  
and this is gonna be an object with a
zero in it and then null here and this

880
00:26:59,980 --> 00:26:59,990  
zero in it and then null here and this
 

881
00:26:59,990 --> 00:27:04,330  
zero in it and then null here and this
should get me to the same place right so

882
00:27:04,330 --> 00:27:04,340  
should get me to the same place right so
 

883
00:27:04,340 --> 00:27:06,670  
should get me to the same place right so
if I run yarn start this should

884
00:27:06,670 --> 00:27:06,680  
if I run yarn start this should
 

885
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:15,730  
if I run yarn start this should
definitely fail unexpected token I don't

886
00:27:15,730 --> 00:27:15,740  
definitely fail unexpected token I don't
 

887
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:23,760  
definitely fail unexpected token I don't
disagree with you oh I say

888
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:23,770  
 
 

889
00:27:23,770 --> 00:27:29,160  
 
okay

890
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:29,170  
 
 

891
00:27:29,170 --> 00:27:31,090  
 
well it's definitely throwing an error

892
00:27:31,090 --> 00:27:31,100  
well it's definitely throwing an error
 

893
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:33,430  
well it's definitely throwing an error
that's great I'm not sure why just isn't

894
00:27:33,430 --> 00:27:33,440  
that's great I'm not sure why just isn't
 

895
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:58,210  
that's great I'm not sure why just isn't
picking it up

896
00:27:58,210 --> 00:27:58,220  
 
 

897
00:27:58,220 --> 00:28:05,480  
 
hmm no you must wrap the code in a

898
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:05,490  
hmm no you must wrap the code in a
 

899
00:28:05,490 --> 00:28:07,190  
hmm no you must wrap the code in a
function otherwise the error will be not

900
00:28:07,190 --> 00:28:07,200  
function otherwise the error will be not
 

901
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:14,920  
function otherwise the error will be not
be calling the assertion will fail

902
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:14,930  
 
 

903
00:28:14,930 --> 00:28:19,240  
 
well what does that mean I would guess

904
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:19,250  
well what does that mean I would guess
 

905
00:28:19,250 --> 00:28:20,170  
well what does that mean I would guess
that means this function

906
00:28:20,170 --> 00:28:20,180  
that means this function
 

907
00:28:20,180 --> 00:28:32,680  
that means this function
oh oh maybe I didn't do that

908
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:32,690  
 
 

909
00:28:32,690 --> 00:28:38,230  
 
I see so it has to go inside of the

910
00:28:38,230 --> 00:28:38,240  
I see so it has to go inside of the
 

911
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:49,500  
I see so it has to go inside of the
expect look at that

912
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:49,510  
 
 

913
00:28:49,510 --> 00:28:57,360  
 
okay so now this should work

914
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:57,370  
 
 

915
00:28:57,370 --> 00:28:59,399  
 
yeah look at that okay so that was

916
00:28:59,399 --> 00:28:59,409  
yeah look at that okay so that was
 

917
00:28:59,409 --> 00:29:02,340  
yeah look at that okay so that was
that's just a nuance of just so like I

918
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:02,350  
that's just a nuance of just so like I
 

919
00:29:02,350 --> 00:29:04,379  
that's just a nuance of just so like I
said I'm learning that still but that's

920
00:29:04,379 --> 00:29:04,389  
said I'm learning that still but that's
 

921
00:29:04,389 --> 00:29:06,330  
said I'm learning that still but that's
the only way to catch an exception is if

922
00:29:06,330 --> 00:29:06,340  
the only way to catch an exception is if
 

923
00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:08,789  
the only way to catch an exception is if
it's within a function returning sort of

924
00:29:08,789 --> 00:29:08,799  
it's within a function returning sort of
 

925
00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:10,289  
it's within a function returning sort of
the output of that function which would

926
00:29:10,289 --> 00:29:10,299  
the output of that function which would
 

927
00:29:10,299 --> 00:29:16,230  
the output of that function which would
be the exception that's cool right this

928
00:29:16,230 --> 00:29:16,240  
be the exception that's cool right this
 

929
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:17,430  
be the exception that's cool right this
is a little aggravating and I'd like to

930
00:29:17,430 --> 00:29:17,440  
is a little aggravating and I'd like to
 

931
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:22,440  
is a little aggravating and I'd like to
get rid of it but maybe we'll work on

932
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:22,450  
get rid of it but maybe we'll work on
 

933
00:29:22,450 --> 00:29:24,899  
get rid of it but maybe we'll work on
that so my point here is you can see how

934
00:29:24,899 --> 00:29:24,909  
that so my point here is you can see how
 

935
00:29:24,909 --> 00:29:27,600  
that so my point here is you can see how
this is testing this function more more

936
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:27,610  
this is testing this function more more
 

937
00:29:27,610 --> 00:29:29,940  
this is testing this function more more
thoroughly one thing I might also test

938
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:29,950  
thoroughly one thing I might also test
 

939
00:29:29,950 --> 00:29:32,909  
thoroughly one thing I might also test
for in this guy so when I'm writing this

940
00:29:32,909 --> 00:29:32,919  
for in this guy so when I'm writing this
 

941
00:29:32,919 --> 00:29:34,710  
for in this guy so when I'm writing this
function to the best possible capacity

942
00:29:34,710 --> 00:29:34,720  
function to the best possible capacity
 

943
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:37,230  
function to the best possible capacity
is a type check to make sure that

944
00:29:37,230 --> 00:29:37,240  
is a type check to make sure that
 

945
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:39,180  
is a type check to make sure that
positions both have a latitude and a

946
00:29:39,180 --> 00:29:39,190  
positions both have a latitude and a
 

947
00:29:39,190 --> 00:30:01,170  
positions both have a latitude and a
longitude so

948
00:30:01,170 --> 00:30:01,180  
 
 

949
00:30:01,180 --> 00:30:03,880  
 
so this is saying basically if either of

950
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:03,890  
so this is saying basically if either of
 

951
00:30:03,890 --> 00:30:05,020  
so this is saying basically if either of
these are missing a lot of tuturro

952
00:30:05,020 --> 00:30:05,030  
these are missing a lot of tuturro
 

953
00:30:05,030 --> 00:30:09,600  
these are missing a lot of tuturro
longitude we're gonna throw new error

954
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:09,610

recall and so now we can test against

968
00:30:36,010 --> 00:30:36,020  
recall and so now we can test against
 

969
00:30:36,020 --> 00:30:45,100  
recall and so now we can test against
that too so we would do tests both input

970
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:45,110  
that too so we would do tests both input
 

971
00:30:45,110 --> 00:31:03,950  
that too so we would do tests both input
coordinates must have lat

00:33:03,980 --> 00:33:11,620  
other tests I might write for distance
between points and we're gonna do like

1056
00:33:11,620 --> 00:33:11,630  
between points and we're gonna do like
 

1057

this make sure and valid yeah sure
 

1059
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:27,550  
this make sure and valid yeah sure
launch are valid latitudes and

1060

launch are valid latitudes and
 

1061
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:34,890  
launch are valid latitudes and
longitudes make sure distance is

1062
00:33:34,890 --> 00:33:34,900  
longitudes make sure distance is
 

1063
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:40,020  
longitudes make sure distance is
calculated correctly across

so because we're working with a sphere

1068
00:33:47,110 --> 00:33:47,120  
so because we're working with a sphere
 

1069
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:49,150  
so because we're working with a sphere
the globe is is defined in two sort of

1070
00:33:49,150 --> 00:33:49,160  
the globe is is defined in two sort of
 

1071
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:51,820  
the globe is is defined in two sort of
180 degree hemispheres and the

1072
00:33:51,820 --> 00:33:51,830  
180 degree hemispheres and the
 

1073
00:33:51,830 --> 00:33:53,110  
180 degree hemispheres and the
interesting points along the that

1074
00:33:53,110 --> 00:33:53,120  
interesting points along the that
 

1075
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:55,060  
interesting points along the that
hemisphere for this calculation or when

1076
00:33:55,060 --> 00:33:55,070  
hemisphere for this calculation or when
 

1077
00:33:55,070 --> 00:33:58,690  
hemisphere for this calculation or when
it goes from zero it goes from zero to

1078
00:33:58,690 --> 00:33:58,700  
it goes from zero it goes from zero to
 

1079
00:33:58,700 --> 00:34:01,270  
it goes from zero it goes from zero to
180 in both directions so negative and

1080
00:34:01,270 --> 00:34:01,280  
180 in both directions so negative and
 

1081
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:04,299  
180 in both directions so negative and
positive so at one point it meets a sort

1082
00:34:04,299 --> 00:34:04,309  
positive so at one point it meets a sort
 

1083
00:34:04,309 --> 00:34:05,590  
positive so at one point it meets a sort
of one at negative one and then at the

1084
00:34:05,590 --> 00:34:05,600  
of one at negative one and then at the
 

1085
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:07,630  
of one at negative one and then at the
other point it meets at would I guess

1086
00:34:07,630 --> 00:34:07,640  
other point it meets at would I guess
 

1087
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:09,129  
other point it meets at would I guess
it'd 179 and negative hundred

1088
00:34:09,129 --> 00:34:09,139  
it'd 179 and negative hundred
 

1089
00:34:09,139 --> 00:34:12,369  
it'd 179 and negative hundred
seventy-nine and we need to make sure

1090
00:34:12,369 --> 00:34:12,379  
seventy-nine and we need to make sure
 

1091
00:34:12,379 --> 00:34:13,930  
seventy-nine and we need to make sure
that calculations across those two

1092
00:34:13,930 --> 00:34:13,940  
that calculations across those two
 

1093
00:34:13,940 --> 00:34:17,080  
that calculations across those two
surfaces both on latitude and longitude

1094
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:17,090  
surfaces both on latitude and longitude
 

1095
00:34:17,090 --> 00:34:19,450  
surfaces both on latitude and longitude
work correctly so that's that's probably

1096
00:34:19,450 --> 00:34:19,460  
work correctly so that's that's probably
 

1097
00:34:19,460 --> 00:34:20,889  
work correctly so that's that's probably
a particularly important test for

1098
00:34:20,889 --> 00:34:20,899  
a particularly important test for
 

1099
00:34:20,899 --> 00:34:23,320  
a particularly important test for
something like this and and the kind of

1100
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:23,330  
something like this and and the kind of
 

1101
00:34:23,330 --> 00:34:24,520  
something like this and and the kind of
thing that could definitely come to bite

1102
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:24,530  
thing that could definitely come to bite
 

1103
00:34:24,530 --> 00:34:25,530  
thing that could definitely come to bite
you if you hadn't thought of it

start-up here in town and they launched
 

1111
00:34:34,700 --> 00:34:39,340  
start-up here in town and they launched
a service that manages a pretty complex

throughout the city here that they have
 

1117
00:34:42,679 --> 00:34:44,379  
throughout the city here that they have
to drive around the city which was

1118
00:34:44,379 --> 00:34:44,389  
to drive around the city which was
 

1119
00:34:44,389 --> 00:34:45,700  
to drive around the city which was
working phenomenally and they did some

1120
00:34:45,700 --> 00:34:45,710  
working phenomenally and they did some
 

1121
00:34:45,710 --> 00:34:48,159  
working phenomenally and they did some
really cool algorithm work to make sure

1122
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:48,169  
really cool algorithm work to make sure
 

1123
00:34:48,169 --> 00:34:52,780  
really cool algorithm work to make sure
that the people in that city were

1124
00:34:52,780 --> 00:34:52,790  
that the people in that city were
 

1125
00:34:52,790 --> 00:34:54,639  
that the people in that city were
scheduled to do these driving tasks

1126
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:54,649  
scheduled to do these driving tasks
 

1127
00:34:54,649 --> 00:34:57,940  
scheduled to do these driving tasks
around town in the most efficient path

1128
00:34:57,940 --> 00:34:57,950  
around town in the most efficient path
 

1129
00:34:57,950 --> 00:35:00,130  
around town in the most efficient path
possible but what they didn't take into

1130
00:35:00,130 --> 00:35:00,140  
possible but what they didn't take into
 

1131
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:01,599  
possible but what they didn't take into
account which happened recently it was

1132
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:01,609  
account which happened recently it was
 

1133
00:35:01,609 --> 00:35:02,830  
account which happened recently it was
daylight savings time

1134
00:35:02,830 --> 00:35:02,840  
daylight savings time
 

1135
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:05,130  
daylight savings time
so when daylight savings happened their

1136
00:35:05,130 --> 00:35:05,140  
so when daylight savings happened their
 

1137
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:06,970  
so when daylight savings happened their

00:35:10,150 --> 00:35:10,160  
direction some had already adjusted for
 

1143
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:12,960  
direction some had already adjusted for
it and it was kind of a nightmare so

1144
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:12,970  
it and it was kind of a nightmare so
 

1145
00:35:12,970 --> 00:35:14,830  
it and it was kind of a nightmare so
that's the kind of thing that a test

1146
00:35:14,830 --> 00:35:14,840  
that's the kind of thing that a test
 

1147
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:16,540  
that's the kind of thing that a test
like this might prevent against the

1148
00:35:16,540 --> 00:35:16,550  
like this might prevent against the
 

1149
00:35:16,550 --> 00:35:17,770  
like this might prevent against the
catch is of course that you have to

1150
00:35:17,770 --> 00:35:17,780  
catch is of course that you have to
 

1151
00:35:17,780 --> 00:35:20,109  
catch is of course that you have to
think of that test in order to write it

1152
00:35:20,109 --> 00:35:20,119  
think of that test in order to write it
 

1153
00:35:20,119 --> 00:35:21,490  
think of that test in order to write it
to test against it to make sure that

1154
00:35:21,490 --> 00:35:21,500  
to test against it to make sure that
 

1155
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:23,740  
to test against it to make sure that
you're compliant with the logic that you

1156
00:35:23,740 --> 00:35:23,750  
you're compliant with the logic that you
 

1157
00:35:23,750 --> 00:35:27,790  
you're compliant with the logic that you
need to put in place so for the sake of

1158
00:35:27,790 --> 00:35:27,800  
need to put in place so for the sake of
 

1159
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:30,790  
need to put in place so for the sake of
demonstration on stream here I'm gonna

1160
00:35:30,790 --> 00:35:30,800  
demonstration on stream here I'm gonna
 

1161
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:33,520  
demonstration on stream here I'm gonna
let these four tests be my entire test

1162
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:33,530  
let these four tests be my entire test
 

1163
00:35:33,530 --> 00:35:35,700  
let these four tests be my entire test
suite for the time being while we set up

1164
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:35,710  
suite for the time being while we set up
 

1165
00:35:35,710 --> 00:35:38,470  
suite for the time being while we set up
circle CI integration and then I might

1166
00:35:38,470 --> 00:35:38,480  
circle CI integration and then I might
 

1167
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:39,640  
circle CI integration and then I might
come back and write some more tests

1168
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:39,650  
come back and write some more tests
 

1169
00:35:39,650 --> 00:35:42,290  
come back and write some more tests
against the other parts of this software

1170
00:35:42,290 --> 00:35:42,300  
against the other parts of this software
 

1171
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:44,390  
against the other parts of this software
for now this will do so let's look at

1172
00:35:44,390 --> 00:35:44,400  
for now this will do so let's look at
 

1173
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:45,830  
for now this will do so let's look at
what we have to do to get circled going

1174
00:35:45,830 --> 00:35:45,840  
what we have to do to get circled going
 

1175
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:49,030  
what we have to do to get circled going
so I'm gonna close all these files and

1176
00:35:49,030 --> 00:35:49,040  
so I'm gonna close all these files and
 

1177
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:56,630  
so I'm gonna close all these files and
we'll go to Circle C eyes Doc's here so

1178
00:35:56,630 --> 00:35:56,640  
we'll go to Circle C eyes Doc's here so
 

1179
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:58,610  
we'll go to Circle C eyes Doc's here so
I'm adding this this is the repo I'm

1180
00:35:58,610 --> 00:35:58,620  
I'm adding this this is the repo I'm
 

1181
00:35:58,620 --> 00:36:00,050  
I'm adding this this is the repo I'm
adding it to circle CI this is sort of

1182
00:36:00,050 --> 00:36:00,060  
adding it to circle CI this is sort of
 

1183
00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:02,600  
adding it to circle CI this is sort of
inside of their app already what they do

1184
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:02,610  
inside of their app already what they do
 

1185
00:36:02,610 --> 00:36:04,490  
inside of their app already what they do
actually is they go and integrate with

1186
00:36:04,490 --> 00:36:04,500  
actually is they go and integrate with
 

1187
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:06,440  
actually is they go and integrate with
github so I have authenticated circle CI

1188
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:06,450  
github so I have authenticated circle CI
 

1189
00:36:06,450 --> 00:36:09,500  
github so I have authenticated circle CI
with github it's looking at my repo

1190
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:09,510  
with github it's looking at my repo
 

1191
00:36:09,510 --> 00:36:11,270  
with github it's looking at my repo
already and what it's done is it's

1192
00:36:11,270 --> 00:36:11,280  
already and what it's done is it's
 

1193
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:12,950  
already and what it's done is it's
determined that it can run either on

1194
00:36:12,950 --> 00:36:12,960  
determined that it can run either on
 

1195
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:14,540  
determined that it can run either on
Linux or Mac OS or probably runs on

1196
00:36:14,540 --> 00:36:14,550  
Linux or Mac OS or probably runs on
 

1197
00:36:14,550 --> 00:36:16,880  
Linux or Mac OS or probably runs on
either Linux or Mac OS in fact I'm not

1198
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:16,890  
either Linux or Mac OS in fact I'm not
 

1199
00:36:16,890 --> 00:36:19,040  
either Linux or Mac OS in fact I'm not
sure circle tests against Windows

1200
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:19,050  
sure circle tests against Windows
 

1201
00:36:19,050 --> 00:36:22,820  
sure circle tests against Windows
it may well so it asks which OS you're

1202
00:36:22,820 --> 00:36:22,830  
it may well so it asks which OS you're
 

1203
00:36:22,830 --> 00:36:24,320  
it may well so it asks which OS you're
on and asks which language you're using

1204
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:24,330  
on and asks which language you're using
 

1205
00:36:24,330 --> 00:36:26,000  
on and asks which language you're using
which is already inferred based on the

1206
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:26,010  
which is already inferred based on the
 

1207
00:36:26,010 --> 00:36:27,830  
which is already inferred based on the
repo and what's in there and it gives

1208
00:36:27,830 --> 00:36:27,840  
repo and what's in there and it gives
 

1209
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:29,590  
repo and what's in there and it gives
you some instructions for how to

1210
00:36:29,590 --> 00:36:29,600  
you some instructions for how to
 

1211
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:32,870  
you some instructions for how to
configure circle for it so it's actually

1212
00:36:32,870 --> 00:36:32,880  
configure circle for it so it's actually
 

1213
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:35,510  
configure circle for it so it's actually
pretty easy and there's some

1214
00:36:35,510 --> 00:36:35,520  
pretty easy and there's some
 

1215
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:37,130  
pretty easy and there's some
interpretation and different approaches

1216
00:36:37,130 --> 00:36:37,140  
interpretation and different approaches
 

1217
00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:38,390  
interpretation and different approaches
to this but we'll start with a fairly

1218
00:36:38,390 --> 00:36:38,400  
to this but we'll start with a fairly
 

1219
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:41,090  
to this but we'll start with a fairly
simple one so step one create a focal

1220
00:36:41,090 --> 00:36:41,100  
simple one so step one create a focal
 

1221
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:43,700  
simple one so step one create a focal
for the folder named circle CI and add a

1222
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:43,710  
for the folder named circle CI and add a
 

1223
00:36:43,710 --> 00:36:47,210  
for the folder named circle CI and add a
file excuse me had a file called config

1224
00:36:47,210 --> 00:36:47,220  
file excuse me had a file called config
 

1225
00:36:47,220 --> 00:36:49,460  
file excuse me had a file called config
dot yml within it file path lily circle

1226
00:36:49,460 --> 00:36:49,470  
dot yml within it file path lily circle
 

1227
00:36:49,470 --> 00:36:52,700  
dot yml within it file path lily circle
CI config dot yml so we're gonna create

1228
00:36:52,700 --> 00:36:52,710  
CI config dot yml so we're gonna create
 

1229
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:55,940  
CI config dot yml so we're gonna create
a dot circle CI and I believe V s code

1230
00:36:55,940 --> 00:36:55,950  
a dot circle CI and I believe V s code
 

1231
00:36:55,950 --> 00:37:00,310  
a dot circle CI and I believe V s code
will detect it that is nope maybe not

1232
00:37:00,310 --> 00:37:00,320  
will detect it that is nope maybe not
 

1233
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:04,430  
will detect it that is nope maybe not
config yml yeah okay

1234
00:37:04,430 --> 00:37:04,440  
config yml yeah okay
 

1235
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:05,480  
config yml yeah okay
there's some formatting I thought there

1236
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:05,490  
there's some formatting I thought there
 

1237
00:37:05,490 --> 00:37:07,810  
there's some formatting I thought there
was a special circle CI integration here

1238
00:37:07,810 --> 00:37:07,820  
was a special circle CI integration here
 

1239
00:37:07,820 --> 00:37:09,980  
was a special circle CI integration here
populate the config with the contents of

1240
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:09,990

your work
so we're gonna do all these changes

1260
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:27,810  
so we're gonna do all these changes
 

1261
00:37:27,810 --> 00:37:29,750  
so we're gonna do all these changes
first we'll write this to work against

1262
00:37:29,750 --> 00:37:29,760  
first we'll write this to work against
 

1263
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:32,840  
first we'll write this to work against
our repo oh and actually before I do

1264
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:32,850  
our repo oh and actually before I do
 

1265
00:37:32,850 --> 00:37:34,040  
our repo oh and actually before I do
this I'm gonna take one step backwards

1266
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:34,050  
this I'm gonna take one step backwards
 

1267
00:37:34,050 --> 00:37:38,650  
this I'm gonna take one step backwards
so this this function here yarn test

1268
00:37:38,650 --> 00:37:38,660  
so this this function here yarn test
 

1269
00:37:38,660 --> 00:37:41,030  
so this this function here yarn test
it's important to me or at least I think

1270
00:37:41,030 --> 00:37:41,040  
it's important to me or at least I think
 

1271
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:44,990  
it's important to me or at least I think
it's a good practice to have a CI

1272
00:37:44,990 --> 00:37:45,000  
it's a good practice to have a CI
 

1273
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:48,530  
it's a good practice to have a CI
command so we're gonna do tests Oh

1274
00:37:48,530 --> 00:37:48,540  
command so we're gonna do tests Oh
 

1275
00:37:48,540 --> 00:37:49,760  
command so we're gonna do tests Oh
actually you know we can do this a

1276
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:49,770  
actually you know we can do this a
 

1277
00:37:49,770 --> 00:37:52,820  
actually you know we can do this a
different way so my whole point is in CI

1278
00:37:52,820 --> 00:37:52,830  
different way so my whole point is in CI
 

1279
00:37:52,830 --> 00:37:54,500  
different way so my whole point is in CI
I'm going to run this test script and

1280
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:54,510  
I'm going to run this test script and
 

1281
00:37:54,510 --> 00:37:55,069  
I'm going to run this test script and
this lint

1282
00:37:55,069 --> 00:37:55,079  
this lint
 

1283
00:37:55,079 --> 00:37:57,140  
this lint
script and make sure they both pass just

1284
00:37:57,140 --> 00:37:57,150  
script and make sure they both pass just
 

1285
00:37:57,150 --> 00:37:58,789  
script and make sure they both pass just
for the sake of being thorough so let's

1286
00:37:58,789 --> 00:37:58,799  
for the sake of being thorough so let's
 

1287
00:37:58,799 --> 00:38:00,650  
for the sake of being thorough so let's
go into that config file and we will do

1288
00:38:00,650 --> 00:38:00,660  
go into that config file and we will do
 

1289
00:38:00,660 --> 00:38:05,839  
go into that config file and we will do
them in here so this is a yellow file

1290
00:38:05,839 --> 00:38:05,849  
them in here so this is a yellow file
 

1291
00:38:05,849 --> 00:38:07,849  
them in here so this is a yellow file
which has a specific format it's a lot

1292
00:38:07,849 --> 00:38:07,859  
which has a specific format it's a lot
 

1293
00:38:07,859 --> 00:38:09,049  
which has a specific format it's a lot
like Jason it's just a little more

1294
00:38:09,049 --> 00:38:09,059  
like Jason it's just a little more
 

1295
00:38:09,059 --> 00:38:11,599  
like Jason it's just a little more
compact a lot of this stuff comes from

1296
00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:11,609  
compact a lot of this stuff comes from
 

1297
00:38:11,609 --> 00:38:14,329  
compact a lot of this stuff comes from
circles specifications for what what

1298
00:38:14,329 --> 00:38:14,339  
circles specifications for what what
 

1299
00:38:14,339 --> 00:38:15,559  
circles specifications for what what
there am a file looks like for the

00:38:15,559 --> 00:38:15,569  
there am a file looks like for the

circle CI slash node 710 we can specify

1304
00:38:22,039 --> 00:38:22,049  
circle CI slash node 710 we can specify
 

1305
00:38:22,049 --> 00:38:25,160  
circle CI slash node 710 we can specify
the version we desire based on that we

1306
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:25,170  
the version we desire based on that we
 

1307
00:38:25,170 --> 00:38:26,569  
the version we desire based on that we
could go see what docker images are

1308
00:38:26,569 --> 00:38:26,579  
could go see what docker images are
 

1309
00:38:26,579 --> 00:38:28,249  
could go see what docker images are
available here but that one will

1310
00:38:28,249 --> 00:38:28,259  
available here but that one will
 

1311
00:38:28,259 --> 00:38:31,910  
available here but that one will
probably work it creates a working

1312
00:38:31,910 --> 00:38:31,920  
probably work it creates a working
 

1313
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:37,519  
probably work it creates a working
directory which we can which will use

1314
00:38:37,519 --> 00:38:37,529  
directory which we can which will use
 

1315
00:38:37,529 --> 00:38:42,039  
directory which we can which will use
its its home directory slash repo I

1316
00:38:42,039 --> 00:38:42,049  
its its home directory slash repo I
 

1317
00:38:42,049 --> 00:38:44,359  
its its home directory slash repo I
think it's best practice to put the repo

1318
00:38:44,359 --> 00:38:44,369  
think it's best practice to put the repo
 

1319
00:38:44,369 --> 00:38:46,910  
think it's best practice to put the repo
name in here and actually this repo is

1320
00:38:46,910 --> 00:38:46,920  
name in here and actually this repo is
 

1321
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:48,650  
name in here and actually this repo is
not called jobs module it's called jobs

1322
00:38:48,650 --> 00:38:48,660  
not called jobs module it's called jobs
 

1323
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:52,910  
not called jobs module it's called jobs
micro service so we're gonna hang on to

1324
00:38:52,910 --> 00:38:52,920  
micro service so we're gonna hang on to
 

1325
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:56,089  
micro service so we're gonna hang on to
that it checks out the code so it pulls

1326
00:38:56,089 --> 00:38:56,099  
that it checks out the code so it pulls
 

1327
00:38:56,099 --> 00:38:59,089  
that it checks out the code so it pulls
it down from github it pulls down the

1328
00:38:59,089 --> 00:38:59,099  
it down from github it pulls down the
 

1329
00:38:59,099 --> 00:39:02,269  
it down from github it pulls down the
cache and dependencies which is fine

1330
00:39:02,269 --> 00:39:02,279  
cache and dependencies which is fine
 

1331
00:39:02,279 --> 00:39:05,209

it runs yarn install it then runs yarn

1332
00:39:05,209 --> 00:39:05,219  
it runs yarn install it then runs yarn
 

1333

1335
00:39:07,559 --> 00:39:10,339  
tests we're also going to run yarn lint
and that should be it that that is all

1336
00:39:10,339 --> 00:39:10,349  
and that should be it that that is all
 

1337
00:39:10,349 --> 00:39:12,069  
and that should be it that that is all
it takes to send this thing up to circle

1338
00:39:12,069 --> 00:39:12,079  
it takes to send this thing up to circle
 

1339

easier so here we go so first I'm going
 

1357
00:39:55,320 --> 00:40:02,140  
easier so here we go so first I'm going
to do the test stuff which is here so

1358
00:40:02,140 --> 00:40:02,150  
to do the test stuff which is here so
 

1359
00:40:02,150 --> 00:40:07,780  
to do the test stuff which is here so
update dependencies config for just

1360
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:07,790  
update dependencies config for just
 

1361
00:40:07,790 --> 00:40:10,880  
update dependencies config for just
that's gonna be this guy as well and

1362
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:10,890  
that's gonna be this guy as well and
 

1363
00:40:10,890 --> 00:40:16,850  
that's gonna be this guy as well and
this guy we should get rid of that code

1364
00:40:16,850 --> 00:40:16,860  
this guy we should get rid of that code
 

1365
00:40:16,860 --> 00:40:23,030  
this guy we should get rid of that code
which is no longer necessary so let's do

1366
00:40:23,030 --> 00:40:23,040  
which is no longer necessary so let's do
 

1367
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:27,860  
which is no longer necessary so let's do
that we're going to add these test cases

1368
00:40:27,860 --> 00:40:27,870  
that we're going to add these test cases
 

1369
00:40:27,870 --> 00:40:37,130  
that we're going to add these test cases
in

1370
00:40:37,130 --> 00:40:37,140  
 
 

1371
00:40:37,140 --> 00:40:39,839  
 
we'll commit that and then we're also

1372
00:40:39,839 --> 00:40:39,849  
we'll commit that and then we're also
 

1373
00:40:39,849 --> 00:40:47,339  
we'll commit that and then we're also
going to configure circle CI so we're

1374
00:40:47,339 --> 00:40:47,349  
going to configure circle CI so we're
 

1375
00:40:47,349 --> 00:40:48,690  
going to configure circle CI so we're
gonna push these five commits up to

1376
00:40:48,690 --> 00:40:48,700  
gonna push these five commits up to
 

1377
00:40:48,700 --> 00:40:52,739  
gonna push these five commits up to
github in a moment actually now I'm just

1378
00:40:52,739 --> 00:40:52,749  
github in a moment actually now I'm just
 

1379
00:40:52,749 --> 00:40:53,940  
github in a moment actually now I'm just
gonna do that now so these will be

1380
00:40:53,940 --> 00:40:53,950  
gonna do that now so these will be
 

1381
00:40:53,950 --> 00:40:56,749  
gonna do that now so these will be
pushed up to github on the master branch

1382
00:40:56,749 --> 00:40:56,759  
pushed up to github on the master branch
 

1383
00:40:56,759 --> 00:40:59,519  
pushed up to github on the master branch
we're gonna have to do some magic in a

1384
00:40:59,519 --> 00:40:59,529  
we're gonna have to do some magic in a
 

1385
00:40:59,529 --> 00:41:01,109  
we're gonna have to do some magic in a
bit with this config file but for now

1386
00:41:01,109 --> 00:41:01,119  
bit with this config file but for now
 

1387
00:41:01,119 --> 00:41:02,489  
bit with this config file but for now
this is a good place to start so I hit

1388
00:41:02,489 --> 00:41:02,499  
this is a good place to start so I hit
 

1389
00:41:02,499 --> 00:41:05,219  
this is a good place to start so I hit
start building this is going to go then

1390
00:41:05,219 --> 00:41:05,229  
start building this is going to go then
 

1391
00:41:05,229 --> 00:41:06,960  
start building this is going to go then
look at github and start building from

1392
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:06,970  
look at github and start building from
 

1393
00:41:06,970 --> 00:41:11,039  
look at github and start building from
the repo so it's doing all the things we

1394
00:41:11,039 --> 00:41:11,049  
the repo so it's doing all the things we
 

1395
00:41:11,049 --> 00:41:13,519  
the repo so it's doing all the things we
it just told me or we just told it to do

1396
00:41:13,519 --> 00:41:13,529  
it just told me or we just told it to do
 

1397
00:41:13,529 --> 00:41:15,829  
it just told me or we just told it to do
checking out our code restoring a cache

1398
00:41:15,829 --> 00:41:15,839  
checking out our code restoring a cache
 

1399
00:41:15,839 --> 00:41:18,299  
checking out our code restoring a cache
and installing the dependencies from

1400
00:41:18,299 --> 00:41:18,309  
and installing the dependencies from
 

1401
00:41:18,309 --> 00:41:30,500  
and installing the dependencies from
yarn

1402
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:30,510  
 
 

1403
00:41:30,510 --> 00:41:35,280  
 
this will take a minute of course save

1404
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:35,290  
this will take a minute of course save
 

1405
00:41:35,290 --> 00:41:38,250  
this will take a minute of course save
the cash for possibly use the next time

1406
00:41:38,250 --> 00:41:38,260  
the cash for possibly use the next time
 

1407
00:41:38,260 --> 00:41:39,780  
the cash for possibly use the next time
around so it doesn't the yarn step

1408
00:41:39,780 --> 00:41:39,790  
around so it doesn't the yarn step
 

1409
00:41:39,790 --> 00:41:42,960  
around so it doesn't the yarn step
doesn't take so long it's now running

1410
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:42,970  
doesn't take so long it's now running
 

1411
00:41:42,970 --> 00:41:45,120  
doesn't take so long it's now running
our tests tests fast it's running lint

1412
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:45,130  
our tests tests fast it's running lint
 

1413
00:41:45,130 --> 00:41:46,680  
our tests tests fast it's running lint
which may not pass Hey look at that

1414
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:46,690  
which may not pass Hey look at that
 

1415
00:41:46,690 --> 00:41:48,030  
which may not pass Hey look at that
all those Lin errors that's great

1416
00:41:48,030 --> 00:41:48,040  
all those Lin errors that's great
 

1417
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:51,110  
all those Lin errors that's great
actually so there's our very first build

1418
00:41:51,110 --> 00:41:51,120  
actually so there's our very first build
 

1419
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:54,630  
actually so there's our very first build
on this jobs micro service repo and

1420
00:41:54,630 --> 00:41:54,640  
on this jobs micro service repo and
 

1421
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:57,150  
on this jobs micro service repo and
there are a bunch of problems because I

1422
00:41:57,150 --> 00:41:57,160  
there are a bunch of problems because I
 

1423
00:41:57,160 --> 00:42:00,180  
there are a bunch of problems because I
haven't been paying particular attention

1424
00:42:00,180 --> 00:42:00,190  
haven't been paying particular attention
 

1425
00:42:00,190 --> 00:42:02,730  
haven't been paying particular attention
to lint lately so let's go and fix those

1426
00:42:02,730 --> 00:42:02,740  
to lint lately so let's go and fix those
 

1427
00:42:02,740 --> 00:42:04,050  
to lint lately so let's go and fix those
things and then we'll submit another

1428
00:42:04,050 --> 00:42:04,060  
things and then we'll submit another
 

1429
00:42:04,060 --> 00:42:05,820  
things and then we'll submit another
build and hopefully they'll pass the

1430
00:42:05,820 --> 00:42:05,830  
build and hopefully they'll pass the
 

1431
00:42:05,830 --> 00:42:12,720  
build and hopefully they'll pass the
tests so job listing dot Jas has a

1432
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:12,730  
tests so job listing dot Jas has a
 

1433
00:42:12,730 --> 00:42:17,850  
tests so job listing dot Jas has a
problem that this campaign let's see

1434
00:42:17,850 --> 00:42:17,860  
problem that this campaign let's see
 

1435
00:42:17,860 --> 00:42:22,440  
problem that this campaign let's see
where are my problems here campaign prop

1436
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:22,450  
where are my problems here campaign prop
 

1437
00:42:22,450 --> 00:42:32,220  
where are my problems here campaign prop
type is defined but prop is never used

1438
00:42:32,220 --> 00:42:32,230  
 
 

1439
00:42:32,230 --> 00:42:34,410  
 
so what we should do here is just put a

1440
00:42:34,410 --> 00:42:34,420  
so what we should do here is just put a
 

1441
00:42:34,420 --> 00:42:38,430  
so what we should do here is just put a
campaign in here which is fine and

1442
00:42:38,430 --> 00:42:38,440  
campaign in here which is fine and
 

1443
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:40,080  
campaign in here which is fine and
that's probably actually meant to go

1444
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:40,090  
that's probably actually meant to go
 

1445
00:42:40,090 --> 00:42:45,900  
that's probably actually meant to go
inside of this guy okay well we should

1446
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:45,910  
inside of this guy okay well we should
 

1447
00:42:45,910 --> 00:42:46,680  
inside of this guy okay well we should
look at that

1448
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:46,690  
look at that
 

1449
00:42:46,690 --> 00:42:50,160  
look at that
in a second here my voice is killing me

1450
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:50,170  
in a second here my voice is killing me
 

1451
00:42:50,170 --> 00:42:51,780  
in a second here my voice is killing me
I'm going to do a up on water I'll be

1452
00:42:51,780 --> 00:42:51,790  
I'm going to do a up on water I'll be
 

1453
00:42:51,790 --> 00:43:54,339  
I'm going to do a up on water I'll be
back in just a moment

1454
00:43:54,339 --> 00:43:54,349  
 
 

1455
00:43:54,349 --> 00:43:59,949  
 
okay sorry about that I'm back let's do

1456
00:43:59,949 --> 00:43:59,959  
okay sorry about that I'm back let's do
 

1457
00:43:59,959 --> 00:44:09,459  
okay sorry about that I'm back let's do
this thing all right so this is actually

1458
00:44:09,459 --> 00:44:09,469  
this thing all right so this is actually
 

1459
00:44:09,469 --> 00:44:10,689  
this thing all right so this is actually
one case where lint is probably saving

1460
00:44:10,689 --> 00:44:10,699  
one case where lint is probably saving
 

1461
00:44:10,699 --> 00:44:13,150  
one case where lint is probably saving
me um I've provided this campaign prompt

1462
00:44:13,150 --> 00:44:13,160  
me um I've provided this campaign prompt
 

1463
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:15,939  
me um I've provided this campaign prompt
to the job listing and it's not being

1464
00:44:15,939 --> 00:44:15,949  
to the job listing and it's not being
 

1465
00:44:15,949 --> 00:44:17,769  
to the job listing and it's not being
used anywhere inside of this component

1466
00:44:17,769 --> 00:44:17,779  
used anywhere inside of this component
 

1467
00:44:17,779 --> 00:44:19,239  
used anywhere inside of this component
which is probably indicative of a

1468
00:44:19,239 --> 00:44:19,249  
which is probably indicative of a
 

1469
00:44:19,249 --> 00:44:21,670  
which is probably indicative of a
logical error in this case so we're

1470
00:44:21,670 --> 00:44:21,680  
logical error in this case so we're
 

1471
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:23,279  
logical error in this case so we're
gonna leave this generate URL for job

1472
00:44:23,279 --> 00:44:23,289  
gonna leave this generate URL for job
 

1473
00:44:23,289 --> 00:44:26,680  
gonna leave this generate URL for job
function and actually we can see thanks

1474
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:26,690  
function and actually we can see thanks
 

1475
00:44:26,690 --> 00:44:29,529  
function and actually we can see thanks
to vs code inside of this function it

1476
00:44:29,529 --> 00:44:29,539  
to vs code inside of this function it
 

1477
00:44:29,539 --> 00:44:31,809  
to vs code inside of this function it
looks for a campaign prop I'll just

1478
00:44:31,809 --> 00:44:31,819  
looks for a campaign prop I'll just
 

1479
00:44:31,819 --> 00:44:33,459  
looks for a campaign prop I'll just
click on it and show you looks for a

1480
00:44:33,459 --> 00:44:33,469  
click on it and show you looks for a
 

1481
00:44:33,469 --> 00:44:36,459  
click on it and show you looks for a
campaign prop and passes that in as a

1482
00:44:36,459 --> 00:44:36,469  
campaign prop and passes that in as a
 

1483
00:44:36,469 --> 00:44:39,640  
campaign prop and passes that in as a
part of the slug so oh actually it's

1484
00:44:39,640 --> 00:44:39,650  
part of the slug so oh actually it's
 

1485
00:44:39,650 --> 00:44:44,650  
part of the slug so oh actually it's
just up here conveniently enough

to be honest we'll let that be for now
 

1563
00:48:08,610 --> 00:48:14,480  
to be honest we'll let that be for now
so this will be configure yes lint to

1564
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:14,490  
so this will be configure yes lint to
 

1565

this code and I hit push and send it up

1568
00:48:20,630 --> 00:48:20,640  
this code and I hit push and send it up
 

1569
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:24,320  
this code and I hit push and send it up
to the branch on github it will kick off

1570
00:48:24,320 --> 00:48:24,330  
to the branch on github it will kick off
 

1571
00:48:24,330 --> 00:48:27,290  
to the branch on github it will kick off
another build on circle CI in a second

1572
00:48:27,290 --> 00:48:27,300  
another build on circle CI in a second
 

1573
00:48:27,300 --> 00:48:28,880  
another build on circle CI in a second
when we saw it just popped up as queued

1574
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:28,890  
when we saw it just popped up as queued
 

1575
00:48:28,890 --> 00:48:30,350  
when we saw it just popped up as queued
and then we'll run through the test

1576
00:48:30,350 --> 00:48:30,360  
and then we'll run through the test
 

1577
00:48:30,360 --> 00:48:36,170  
and then we'll run through the test
again okay and see if I'm bleeding over

1578
00:48:36,170 --> 00:48:36,180  
again okay and see if I'm bleeding over
 

1579

1583
00:49:06,150 --> 00:49:08,610  
 
so we can see this test running it's now

1584
00:49:08,610 --> 00:49:08,620  
so we can see this test running it's now
 

1585
00:49:08,620 --> 00:49:10,560  
so we can see this test running it's now
past everything look at that this build

doing this development work so a pattern

1598
00:49:35,610 --> 00:49:35,620  
doing this development work so a pattern
 

1599
00:49:35,620 --> 00:49:37,860  
doing this development work so a pattern
I like to follow when I'm working on

1600
00:49:37,860 --> 00:49:37,870  
I like to follow when I'm working on
 

1601
00:49:37,870 --> 00:49:39,390  
I like to follow when I'm working on
small personal projects here without a

1602
00:49:39,390 --> 00:49:39,400  
small personal projects here without a
 

1603
00:49:39,400 --> 00:49:40,980  
small personal projects here without a
bigger team

1604

is a modification of what's called the
 

1607
00:49:43,240 --> 00:49:46,800  
is a modification of what's called the
git flow workflow which is sort of just

1608
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:46,810  
git flow workflow which is sort of just
 

1609
00:49:46,810 --> 00:49:48,690  
git flow workflow which is sort of just
a pattern to follow with which branches

1610
00:49:48,690 --> 00:49:48,700  
a pattern to follow with which branches
 

1611
00:49:48,700 --> 00:49:50,910  
a pattern to follow with which branches
you're using for development how you run

1612
00:49:50,910 --> 00:49:50,920  
you're using for development how you run
 

1613
00:49:50,920 --> 00:49:54,060  
you're using for development how you run
releases and this and that it's not

1614
00:49:54,060 --> 00:49:54,070  
releases and this and that it's not
 

1615
00:49:54,070 --> 00:50:00,900  
releases and this and that it's not
super hard but we can basically define

1616
00:50:00,900 --> 00:50:00,910  
super hard but we can basically define
 

1617
00:50:00,910 --> 00:50:03,030  
super hard but we can basically define
some branches that we use specifically

1618
00:50:03,030 --> 00:50:03,040  
some branches that we use specifically
 

1619
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:06,570  
some branches that we use specifically
in one case versus the next so when I'm

1620
00:50:06,570 --> 00:50:06,580  
in one case versus the next so when I'm
 

1621
00:50:06,580 --> 00:50:11,130  
in one case versus the next so when I'm
building something we can define well

1622
00:50:11,130 --> 00:50:11,140  
building something we can define well
 

1623
00:50:11,140 --> 00:50:12,750  
building something we can define well

some specific functionality depending on
the branch that we're in so because of

1780
00:53:50,460 --> 00:53:50,470  
the branch that we're in so because of
 

1781
00:53:50,470 --> 00:53:52,200  
the branch that we're in so because of
this new pull request magic we're adding

1782
00:53:52,200 --> 00:53:52,210  
this new pull request magic we're adding
 

1783
00:53:52,210 --> 00:53:56,130  
this new pull request magic we're adding
in we want to make sure that they're

1784
00:53:56,130 --> 00:53:56,140  
in we want to make sure that they're
 

1785

00:54:00,540 --> 00:54:00,550  
there certain behaviors in place for the
 

1787
00:54:00,550 --> 00:54:02,490  
there certain behaviors in place for the
develop branch and the master branch

1788
00:54:02,490 --> 00:54:02,500  
develop branch and the master branch
 

1789
00:54:02,500 --> 00:54:05,460  
develop branch and the master branch
which are now special cases so let's do

1790
00:54:05,460 --> 00:54:05,470  
which are now special cases so let's do
 

1791
00:54:05,470 --> 00:54:08,580  
which are now special cases so let's do
that it's going to require some

1792
00:54:08,580 --> 00:54:08,590  
that it's going to require some
 

1793
00:54:08,590 --> 00:54:11,490  
that it's going to require some
modification to this file and that's

1794
00:54:11,490 --> 00:54:11,500  
modification to this file and that's
 

1795
00:54:11,500 --> 00:54:17,430  
modification to this file and that's
totally okay so we're looking for some

1796
00:54:17,430 --> 00:54:17,440  
totally okay so we're looking for some
 

1797
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:20,850  
totally okay so we're looking for some
syntax on the circle CI config that's

1798
00:54:20,850 --> 00:54:20,860  
syntax on the circle CI config that's
 

1799
00:54:20,860 --> 00:54:22,170  
syntax on the circle CI config that's
specific to branches so I'll show you

1800
00:54:22,170 --> 00:54:22,180  
specific to branches so I'll show you
 

1801
00:54:22,180 --> 00:54:32,760  
specific to branches so I'll show you
how I would find that well these are

1802
00:54:32,760 --> 00:54:32,770  
how I would find that well these are
 

1803
00:54:32,770 --> 00:54:34,830  
how I would find that well these are
sample config files which is lovely

1804
00:54:34,830 --> 00:54:34,840  
sample config files which is lovely
 

1805
00:54:34,840 --> 00:54:39,710  
sample config files which is lovely
we're gonna do configuration reference

1806
00:54:39,710 --> 00:54:39,720  
we're gonna do configuration reference
 

1807
00:54:39,720 --> 00:54:42,620  
we're gonna do configuration reference
and basically what I'm looking for is

1808
00:54:42,620 --> 00:54:42,630  
and basically what I'm looking for is
 

1809
00:54:42,630 --> 00:54:45,770  
and basically what I'm looking for is
branches hey look at that

1810
00:54:45,770 --> 00:54:45,780  
branches hey look at that
 

1811
00:54:45,780 --> 00:54:47,940  
branches hey look at that
so defines rules for whitelisting

1812
00:54:47,940 --> 00:54:47,950  
so defines rules for whitelisting
 

1813
00:54:47,950 --> 00:54:50,040  
so defines rules for whitelisting
blacklisting execution of some branches

1814

probably what we need to do instead so
 

1827
00:55:01,240 --> 00:55:08,200  
probably what we need to do instead so
see workflow section for details

circle CI so basically what it'll do is

1836
00:55:23,680 --> 00:55:23,690  
circle CI so basically what it'll do is
 

1837
00:55:23,690 --> 00:55:26,770  
circle CI so basically what it'll do is
it'll break your config tasks into

1838
00:55:26,770 --> 00:55:26,780  
it'll break your config tasks into
 

1839
00:55:26,780 --> 00:55:29,890  
it'll break your config tasks into
separate oh it's hard to describe but

00:55:36,370 --> 00:55:36,380  
the test obviously we're on all the
 

1847
00:55:36,380 --> 00:55:38,020  
the test obviously we're on all the
tests if the tests all pass it will then

1848
00:55:38,020 --> 00:55:38,030  
tests if the tests all pass it will then
 

1849
00:55:38,030 --> 00:55:41,260  
tests if the tests all pass it will then
go into the deploy task which we can use

1850
00:55:41,260 --> 00:55:41,270  
go into the deploy task which we can use
 

1851
00:55:41,270 --> 00:55:49,480  
go into the deploy task which we can use
to push things up to Heroku actually I

1852
00:55:49,480 --> 00:55:49,490  
to push things up to Heroku actually I
 

1853
00:55:49,490 --> 00:55:51,010  
to push things up to Heroku actually I
may be overthinking it this may not be

1854
00:55:51,010 --> 00:55:51,020  
may be overthinking it this may not be
 

1855
00:55:51,020 --> 00:55:56,310  
may be overthinking it this may not be
necessary

1856
00:55:56,310 --> 00:55:56,320  
 
 

1857
00:55:56,320 --> 00:56:00,500  
 
okay let's hold off on that for now

1858
00:56:00,500 --> 00:56:00,510  
 
 

1859
00:56:00,510 --> 00:56:02,910  
 
maybe now is when I should be setting up

1860
00:56:02,910 --> 00:56:02,920  
maybe now is when I should be setting up
 

1861
00:56:02,920 --> 00:56:10,880  
maybe now is when I should be setting up

1862
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:10,890  
 
 

1863
00:56:10,890 --> 00:56:19,310  
 
so let's do that

1864
00:56:19,310 --> 00:56:19,320  
 
 

1865
00:56:19,320 --> 00:56:22,859  
 
so on a tab you can't see because I've

so on a tab you can't see because I've
 

1867
00:56:22,869 --> 00:56:25,380  
so on a tab you can't see because I've
forgotten I am creating a new Heroku

1868
00:56:25,380 --> 00:56:25,390  
forgotten I am creating a new Heroku
 

1869

talk about that in a second here we're
 

1925
00:57:52,440 --> 00:57:53,900  
talk about that in a second here we're
not going to use a pipeline because we

00:58:08,089 --> 00:58:08,099  
we might end up doing that okay so now
 

1931

we might end up doing that okay so now
we go into settings config are

1932

probably won't we're gonna add a build
 

1941
00:58:23,040 --> 00:58:26,210  
probably won't we're gonna add a build

this is a node.js project so we will add

1952
00:58:40,819 --> 00:58:40,829  
this is a node.js project so we will add
 

1953
00:58:40,829 --> 00:58:45,829  
this is a node.js project so we will add
the node.js build pack and I believe

1954
00:58:45,829 --> 00:58:45,839  
the node.js build pack and I believe
 

1955
00:58:45,839 --> 00:58:50,390  
the node.js build pack and I believe
that might be all I need to do here to

1956
00:58:50,390 --> 00:58:50,400  
that might be all I need to do here to
 

1957
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:56,720  
that might be all I need to do here to
make this work I believe I believe oh no

1958
00:58:56,720 --> 00:58:56,730  
make this work I believe I believe oh no
 

1959

that's great so I am actually since I
 

1965
00:59:07,500 --> 00:59:08,720  
that's great so I am actually since I
didn't do anything I'm gonna rename this

that works naming and location it should

the new line each process type is a
 

2011
01:00:23,850 --> 01:00:25,070  
the new line each process type is a
declaration of a command that is

2012
01:00:25,070 --> 01:00:25,080  
declaration of a command that is
 

2013
01:00:25,080 --> 01:00:26,870  
declaration of a command that is
executed when a dyno of that process

2014
01:00:26,870 --> 01:00:26,880  
executed when a dyno of that process
 

2015
01:00:26,880 --> 01:00:28,880  
executed when a dyno of that process
type is started for example if a web

2016
01:00:28,880 --> 01:00:28,890  
type is started for example if a web
 

2017
01:00:28,890 --> 01:00:30,950  
type is started for example if a web
process type is declared then when a

2018
01:00:30,950 --> 01:00:30,960  
process type is declared then when a
 

2019
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:32,720  
process type is declared then when a
dyno of that type is started the command

2020
01:00:32,720 --> 01:00:32,730  
dyno of that type is started the command
 

2021
01:00:32,730 --> 01:00:34,490  
dyno of that type is started the command
associated with the web process type

2022
01:00:34,490 --> 01:00:34,500  
associated with the web process type

will be executed that comma probably

2024
01:00:36,650 --> 01:00:36,660  
will be executed that comma probably
 

2025
01:00:36,660 --> 01:00:38,570  
will be executed that comma probably
doesn't need to be there this could mean

2026
01:00:38,570 --> 01:00:38,580  
doesn't need to be there this could mean
 

2027
01:00:38,580 --> 01:00:40,880  
doesn't need to be there this could mean
starting a web server for example so

2028
01:00:40,880 --> 01:00:40,890  
starting a web server for example so
 

2029
01:00:40,890 --> 01:00:43,100  
starting a web server for example so
basically this is defining the type of

2030
01:00:43,100 --> 01:00:43,110  
basically this is defining the type of
 

2031
01:00:43,110 --> 01:00:44,600  
basically this is defining the type of
process and then this is the command to

2032
01:00:44,600 --> 01:00:44,610  
process and then this is the command to
 

2033
01:00:44,610 --> 01:00:47,560  
process and then this is the command to
run so this is a ruby on rails app

2034
01:00:47,560 --> 01:00:47,570  
run so this is a ruby on rails app
 

2035
01:00:47,570 --> 01:00:51,050  
run so this is a ruby on rails app
that's a closure app apparently Java all

2036
01:00:51,050 --> 01:00:51,060  
that's a closure app apparently Java all
 

2037
01:00:51,060 --> 01:00:52,910  
that's a closure app apparently Java all

Babel conversions and then runs yeah so

2306
01:10:05,820 --> 01:10:05,830  
Babel conversions and then runs yeah so
 

2307
01:10:05,830 --> 01:10:08,310  
Babel conversions and then runs yeah so
it runs a couple commands at once or

2308
01:10:08,310 --> 01:10:08,320  
it runs a couple commands at once or
 

2309
01:10:08,320 --> 01:10:09,959  
it runs a couple commands at once or
sorry runs this node monban which looks

2310
01:10:09,959 --> 01:10:09,969  
sorry runs this node monban which looks
 

2311
01:10:09,969 --> 01:10:12,899  
sorry runs this node monban which looks
for changes so we're actually gonna have

2312
01:10:12,899 --> 01:10:12,909  
for changes so we're actually gonna have
 

2313
01:10:12,909 --> 01:10:14,550  
for changes so we're actually gonna have
to update this this is gonna now be my

2314
01:10:14,550 --> 01:10:14,560  
to update this this is gonna now be my
 

2315
01:10:14,560 --> 01:10:21,300  
to update this this is gonna now be my
start dev command and we'll have a start

2316
01:10:21,300 --> 01:10:21,310  
start dev command and we'll have a start
 

2317
01:10:21,310 --> 01:10:25,100  
start dev command and we'll have a start
server command which will just run the

2318
01:10:25,100 --> 01:10:25,110  
server command which will just run the
 

2319
01:10:25,110 --> 01:10:34,379  
server command which will just run the
transpiled code and I'm gonna actually I

2320
01:10:34,379 --> 01:10:34,389  
transpiled code and I'm gonna actually I
 

2321
01:10:34,389 --> 01:10:40,649  
transpiled code and I'm gonna actually I
have to actually test which command that

2322
01:10:40,649 --> 01:10:40,659  
have to actually test which command that
 

2323
01:10:40,659 --> 01:10:42,780  
have to actually test which command that
is so let's come into here and we're

2324
01:10:42,780 --> 01:10:42,790  
is so let's come into here and we're
 

2325
01:10:42,790 --> 01:10:46,859  
is so let's come into here and we're
gonna run node and all of that that

2326
01:10:46,859 --> 01:10:46,869  
gonna run node and all of that that
 

2327
01:10:46,869 --> 01:10:53,609  
gonna run node and all of that that
didn't work okay oh I see so we're gonna

2328
01:10:53,609 --> 01:10:53,619  
didn't work okay oh I see so we're gonna
 

2329
01:10:53,619 --> 01:10:55,780  
didn't work okay oh I see so we're gonna
have to have a build step

2330
01:10:55,780 --> 01:10:55,790  
have to have a build step
 

2331
01:10:55,790 --> 01:11:10,830  
have to have a build step
[Music]

2332
01:11:10,830 --> 01:11:10,840  
 
 

2333
01:11:10,840 --> 01:11:16,370  
 
hmm

2334
01:11:16,370 --> 01:11:16,380  
 
 

2335
01:11:16,380 --> 01:11:19,500  
 
okay so there's gonna be a few things

2336
01:11:19,500 --> 01:11:19,510  
okay so there's gonna be a few things
 

2337
01:11:19,510 --> 01:11:22,200  
okay so there's gonna be a few things
that get added here build which will

2338
01:11:22,200 --> 01:11:22,210  
that get added here build which will
 

2339
01:11:22,210 --> 01:11:24,660  
that get added here build which will
compile my your transpiling my code so

2340
01:11:24,660 --> 01:11:24,670  
compile my your transpiling my code so
 

2341
01:11:24,670 --> 01:11:28,500  
compile my your transpiling my code so
this will be the babel node bit and then

2342
01:11:28,500 --> 01:11:28,510  
this will be the babel node bit and then
 

2343
01:11:28,510 --> 01:11:31,919  
this will be the babel node bit and then
we're gonna have start server which runs

2344
01:11:31,919 --> 01:11:31,929  
we're gonna have start server which runs
 

2345
01:11:31,929 --> 01:11:40,229  
we're gonna have start server which runs
on babel yarn build and node index j a

2346
01:11:40,229 --> 01:11:40,239  
on babel yarn build and node index j a
 

2347
01:11:40,239 --> 01:11:42,419  
on babel yarn build and node index j a
spore that index IJ s is going to be in

2348
01:11:42,419 --> 01:11:42,429  
spore that index IJ s is going to be in
 

2349
01:11:42,429 --> 01:11:49,680  
spore that index IJ s is going to be in
a built directory somewhere here so

2350
01:11:49,680 --> 01:11:49,690  
a built directory somewhere here so
 

2351
01:11:49,690 --> 01:11:52,620  
a built directory somewhere here so
let's see how that has to work all of

2352
01:11:52,620 --> 01:11:52,630  
let's see how that has to work all of
 

2353
01:11:52,630 --> 01:11:54,390  
let's see how that has to work all of
this is jumping through some hoops to

2354
01:11:54,390 --> 01:11:54,400  
this is jumping through some hoops to
 

2355
01:11:54,400 --> 01:11:56,729  
this is jumping through some hoops to
make everything work because we have to

2356
01:11:56,729 --> 01:11:56,739  
make everything work because we have to
 

2357
01:11:56,739 --> 01:11:58,620  
make everything work because we have to
transpile our code because we chose to

2358
01:11:58,620 --> 01:11:58,630  
transpile our code because we chose to
 

2359
01:11:58,630 --> 01:12:04,350  
transpile our code because we chose to
use es6 syntax in the app here right

2360
01:12:04,350 --> 01:12:04,360  
use es6 syntax in the app here right
 

2361
01:12:04,360 --> 01:12:10,290  
use es6 syntax in the app here right
maybe

2362
01:12:10,290 --> 01:12:10,300  
 
 

2363
01:12:10,300 --> 01:12:13,020  
 
yeah it's not the es6 syntax it's the

2364
01:12:13,020 --> 01:12:13,030  
yeah it's not the es6 syntax it's the
 

2365
01:12:13,030 --> 01:12:28,660  
yeah it's not the es6 syntax it's the
JSX syntax that's the problem here so

2366
01:12:28,660 --> 01:12:28,670  
 
 

2367
01:12:28,670 --> 01:13:06,450  
 
we okay

2368
01:13:06,450 --> 01:13:06,460  
 
 

2369
01:13:06,460 --> 01:13:11,400  
 
hmm okay this is what I'm looking to

2370
01:13:11,400 --> 01:13:11,410  
hmm okay this is what I'm looking to
 

2371
01:13:11,410 --> 01:13:16,380  
hmm okay this is what I'm looking to
execute but I think I need some help

2372
01:13:16,380 --> 01:13:16,390  
execute but I think I need some help
 

2373
01:13:16,390 --> 01:13:25,830  
execute but I think I need some help

plugins presets

2376
01:13:32,720 --> 01:13:32,730  
 
 

2377
01:13:32,730 --> 01:13:45,500  
 
hmm you know what it's possible that

2378
01:13:45,500 --> 01:13:45,510  
 
 

2379
01:13:45,510 --> 01:13:47,299  
 
this might be what I need to run so I'm

2380
01:13:47,299 --> 01:13:47,309  
this might be what I need to run so I'm
 

2381
01:13:47,309 --> 01:13:48,529  
this might be what I need to run so I'm
just trying to figure out which come in

2382
01:13:48,529 --> 01:13:48,539  
just trying to figure out which come in
 

2383
01:13:48,539 --> 01:13:50,299  
just trying to figure out which come in
needs to run to do the transpiling and

2384
01:13:50,299 --> 01:13:50,309  
needs to run to do the transpiling and
 

2385
01:13:50,309 --> 01:13:53,270  
needs to run to do the transpiling and
then run the web service which i think

2386
01:13:53,270 --> 01:13:53,280  
then run the web service which i think
 

2387
01:13:53,280 --> 01:14:10,240  
then run the web service which i think
is and then this list of presets after

2388
01:14:10,240 --> 01:14:10,250  
 
 

2389
01:14:10,250 --> 01:14:15,979  
 
sweet I think that did it so

2390
01:14:15,979 --> 01:14:15,989  
 
 

2391
01:14:15,989 --> 01:14:17,780  
 
let's make sure this is running and

2392
01:14:17,780 --> 01:14:17,790  
let's make sure this is running and
 

2393
01:14:17,790 --> 01:14:23,600  
let's make sure this is running and
doing what we expect yeah okay that

2394
01:14:23,600 --> 01:14:23,610  
doing what we expect yeah okay that
 

2395
01:14:23,610 --> 01:14:26,180  
doing what we expect yeah okay that
worked so it's actually simpler than I

2396
01:14:26,180 --> 01:14:26,190  
worked so it's actually simpler than I
 

2397
01:14:26,190 --> 01:14:27,350  
worked so it's actually simpler than I
thought it was we don't need a build

2398
01:14:27,350 --> 01:14:27,360  
thought it was we don't need a build
 

2399
01:14:27,360 --> 01:14:28,850  
thought it was we don't need a build
step because that's kind of happening on

2400
01:14:28,850 --> 01:14:28,860  
step because that's kind of happening on
 

2401
01:14:28,860 --> 01:14:32,090  
step because that's kind of happening on
the fly here I'm going to run that

2402
01:14:32,090 --> 01:14:32,100  
the fly here I'm going to run that
 

2403
01:14:32,100 --> 01:14:35,629  
the fly here I'm going to run that
command as my start server command so

2404
01:14:35,629 --> 01:14:35,639  
command as my start server command so
 

2405
01:14:35,639 --> 01:14:46,040  
command as my start server command so
that's going to be node it's gonna be

2406
01:14:46,040 --> 01:14:46,050  
that's going to be node it's gonna be
 

2407
01:14:46,050 --> 01:14:47,629  
that's going to be node it's gonna be
just what I dumped into the console here

2408
01:14:47,629 --> 01:14:47,639  
just what I dumped into the console here
 

2409
01:14:47,639 --> 01:14:54,680  
just what I dumped into the console here
a second ago

2410
01:14:54,680 --> 01:14:54,690  
 
 

2411
01:14:54,690 --> 01:14:57,650  
 
and actually we might not even need node

2412
01:14:57,650 --> 01:14:57,660  
and actually we might not even need node
 

2413
01:14:57,660 --> 01:15:00,470  
and actually we might not even need node
there I might even just be able to say

2414
01:15:00,470 --> 01:15:00,480  
there I might even just be able to say
 

2415
01:15:00,480 --> 01:15:06,300  
there I might even just be able to say
this if I run it with yarn yarn start

2416
01:15:06,300 --> 01:15:06,310  
this if I run it with yarn yarn start
 

2417
01:15:06,310 --> 01:15:18,690  
this if I run it with yarn yarn start
server need a comma totally that works

2418
01:15:18,690 --> 01:15:18,700  
server need a comma totally that works
 

2419
01:15:18,700 --> 01:15:20,910  
server need a comma totally that works
okay so now we have this start server

2420
01:15:20,910 --> 01:15:20,920  
okay so now we have this start server
 

2421
01:15:20,920 --> 01:15:24,000  
okay so now we have this start server

so we're going to commit that so and

2430
01:15:35,850 --> 01:15:35,860  
so we're going to commit that so and
 

2431
01:15:35,860 --> 01:15:37,500  
so we're going to commit that so and
actually I need to change the proc file

2432
01:15:37,500 --> 01:15:37,510  
actually I need to change the proc file
 

2433
01:15:37,510 --> 01:15:40,740  
actually I need to change the proc file
to to run start server which will run

2434

to to run start server which will run
 

2435
01:15:40,750 --> 01:15:48,380  
to to run start server which will run
this command instead of just start so
