00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,179
Happy to be together on Happy Together! 

2
00:00:02,179 --> 00:00:04,119
- Hello. It's good to see you again. / - Hello. 

3
00:00:04,919 --> 00:00:06,349
Hyeongyeong. 

4
00:00:06,349 --> 00:00:09,779
You remind me of Irene of Red Velvet. 

5
00:00:09,779 --> 00:00:13,079
- I got my hair dyed like her. / - Right. 

6
00:00:13,419 --> 00:00:16,479
Hyeongyeong dressed up according to the theme 

7
00:00:16,479 --> 00:00:19,349
while Saeho's dressed over the top. 

8
00:00:19,379 --> 00:00:21,849
- ♪ Your eyes, nose and lips ♪ / - He dressed 

9
00:00:21,879 --> 00:00:23,079
- ♪ The touch of ♪ / - like Taeyang. 

10
00:00:23,079 --> 00:00:24,979
- ♪ your hand ♪ / - But he doesn't look good. 

11
00:00:24,979 --> 00:00:27,049
- ♪ I still remember all of them ♪ / - Excuse me. Wait. 

12
00:00:27,049 --> 00:00:28,549
- Hodong. / - Pardon? 

13
00:00:28,649 --> 00:00:30,419
Aren't you Hodong? 

14
00:00:30,419 --> 00:00:32,179
- No, I'm not. / - You'll like today's show. 

15
00:00:32,179 --> 00:00:33,919
They're the reason why I host variety shows. 

16
00:00:33,919 --> 00:00:35,119
It's because of these people. 

17
00:00:35,119 --> 00:00:36,419
I see. 

18
00:00:36,419 --> 00:00:39,049
Today, we'll meet popular girl group members. 

19
00:00:39,349 --> 00:00:42,049
Today's theme is "Train to Entertainment". 

20
00:00:42,049 --> 00:00:44,779
Who could be today's guests? 

21
00:00:44,779 --> 00:00:46,679
Some weird people are on this train. 

22
00:00:46,679 --> 00:00:48,649
(Some weird girls are on this train.) 

23
00:00:48,749 --> 00:00:51,879
(There are 200 girl groups in Korea.) 

24
00:00:52,949 --> 00:00:54,849
(The girl group members are here.) 

25
00:00:55,719 --> 00:00:57,679
(Sunny of Girls' Generation) 

26
00:00:59,019 --> 00:01:02,549
(Solji of EXID, Sejeong of Gugudan) 

27
00:01:03,879 --> 00:01:04,919
(Chahee of MelodyDay, Solbin of Laboum) 

28
00:01:04,919 --> 00:01:06,049
(Yerin of GFriend) 

29
00:01:06,319 --> 00:01:08,049
I'm here to let people know about me. 

30
00:01:08,049 --> 00:01:09,779
(They struggle to be the best entertainers.) 

31
00:01:09,779 --> 00:01:11,189
It's better to cause trouble. 

32
00:01:11,189 --> 00:01:13,649
I think we've already met. 

33
00:01:14,119 --> 00:01:16,419
Did you really have to take it away? 

34
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:19,279
Salmon. Skate! Sole. 

35
00:01:19,879 --> 00:01:21,749
You can't become a star if you can't do that. 

36
00:01:21,749 --> 00:01:22,879
(Don't give up even if it's tough.) 

37
00:01:22,879 --> 00:01:23,919
You need to do it now. 

38
00:01:24,749 --> 00:01:25,979
It's written right here. 

39
00:01:25,979 --> 00:01:28,749
(Survive until the end. "Train to Entertainment") 

40
00:01:29,249 --> 00:01:31,979
As we are in the golden age of girl groups, 

41
00:01:31,979 --> 00:01:34,679
we've invited the hottest rising stars of today 

42
00:01:34,679 --> 00:01:38,979
from the six popular girl groups. 

43
00:01:38,979 --> 00:01:41,049
- Is she a rising star, too? / - Of course. 

44
00:01:41,049 --> 00:01:43,819
- Her dress is stunning. / - When she came in, 

45
00:01:43,819 --> 00:01:45,549
I thought she was going to an awards ceremony. 

46
00:01:45,549 --> 00:01:47,779
- It felt like it's the year end. / - This dress is 

47
00:01:47,779 --> 00:01:49,419
one of the simplest stage outfits. 

48
00:01:49,419 --> 00:01:51,919
- Is this simple for you? / - While waiting, 

49
00:01:51,919 --> 00:01:54,179
- I was worried about my outfit. / - Really? 

50
00:01:54,179 --> 00:01:55,419
Yes. 

51
00:01:55,419 --> 00:01:57,179
But when Saeho came to say hi to me, 

52
00:01:57,179 --> 00:01:58,979
his outfit made me feel relieved. 

53
00:01:59,549 --> 00:02:01,479
He dressed up like Zhu Bajie. 

54
00:02:01,479 --> 00:02:04,549
- I chose this outfit for Sunny. / - You tried... 

55
00:02:04,549 --> 00:02:06,349
- You took off your necklace. / - It's really... 

56
00:02:06,349 --> 00:02:07,719
- Yes, I did. / - It's really... 

57
00:02:07,719 --> 00:02:10,119
The audio director said it was too noisy. 

58
00:02:10,219 --> 00:02:12,119
- Right. / - It's not even real gold. 

59
00:02:12,149 --> 00:02:14,719
- He said it makes too much noise. / - Throw it away. 

60
00:02:14,749 --> 00:02:16,349
I felt confident when I saw that necklace. 

61
00:02:16,379 --> 00:02:17,549
It's made of plastic. 

62
00:02:17,549 --> 00:02:20,589
- Did he go to say hi to you? / - Yes, he did. 

63
00:02:21,719 --> 00:02:25,089
We're close friends, so I always go to see her first. 

64
00:02:25,089 --> 00:02:28,319
Is it true that you rarely answer your phone 

65
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:30,219
when Saeho calls you? 

66
00:02:30,219 --> 00:02:34,979
- Actually, it's fun to tease him. / - I see. 

67
00:02:34,979 --> 00:02:36,479
- His reactions are funny. / - Right. 

68
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:38,779
I don't answer his call purposely. 

69
00:02:38,779 --> 00:02:41,219
- I didn't know. / - Then, he calls me until I answer. 

70
00:02:41,549 --> 00:02:43,079
He's obsessive. 

71
00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:44,079
He keeps calling until I answer the phone. 

72
00:02:44,079 --> 00:02:45,779
- Why do you keep calling her? / - Let me explain. 

73
00:02:45,779 --> 00:02:49,219
I met Sunny not long ago after recording this show. 

74
00:02:49,219 --> 00:02:50,579
She asked me when I'd be done 

75
00:02:50,579 --> 00:02:53,679
and I asked her to wait until I'm done. She said, 

76
00:02:53,679 --> 00:02:56,319
"You can't make a Girls' Generation member wait." 

77
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:58,779
So I went to see her after recording the show. 

78
00:02:58,779 --> 00:03:01,919
Then, she said I didn't have to come to see her. 

79
00:03:02,519 --> 00:03:03,879
I know it was a joke, 

80
00:03:03,879 --> 00:03:07,049
but did she really say that you can't make her wait? 

81
00:03:07,149 --> 00:03:09,719
She emphasizes that she's a Girls' Generation member. 

82
00:03:09,719 --> 00:03:12,119
Sometimes, when we go to a restaurant, 

83
00:03:12,119 --> 00:03:14,279
Sunny pays the bill 

84
00:03:14,279 --> 00:03:15,549
without letting me know. 

85
00:03:15,549 --> 00:03:18,219
When I say that I'm better off these days, 

86
00:03:18,219 --> 00:03:21,519
she says, "I'm a Girls' Generation member." 

87
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:23,479
(I'm a Girls' Generation member.) 

88
00:03:23,479 --> 00:03:26,249
- She's so cool. / - She's cool, indeed. 

89
00:03:26,249 --> 00:03:27,619
"I'm a Girls' Generation member." 

90
00:03:27,619 --> 00:03:28,749
I say that I'm doing my best, and she says, 

91
00:03:28,749 --> 00:03:29,979
"You still have a long way to go." 

92
00:03:29,979 --> 00:03:33,319
- "I'm Sunny of Girls' Generation." / - Saeho. 

93
00:03:33,319 --> 00:03:36,049
- Saeho, save that money. / - She's so cool. 

94
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:38,719
- She's cool. / - I call her Chairman. 

95
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:40,979
- I call Sunny, Chairman. / - "Chairman Lee". 

96
00:03:40,979 --> 00:03:42,149
Isn't EXID as successful as Girls' Generation? 

97
00:03:42,149 --> 00:03:44,949
- He said it as a word. / - He said EXID. 

98
00:03:44,949 --> 00:03:46,179
You should say E-X-I-D. 

99
00:03:46,179 --> 00:03:47,819
- You're as successful as her, right? / - Me? 

100
00:03:47,819 --> 00:03:49,219
- I think you do. / - Of course, I'm not. 

101
00:03:49,219 --> 00:03:51,319
- She's very popular. / - "I'm an EXID member." 

102
00:03:52,579 --> 00:03:54,519
- ♪ Up, down, up, down ♪ / - You're so rude. 

103
00:03:54,519 --> 00:03:57,349
How dare you try to pay the bill? 

104
00:03:59,019 --> 00:04:00,919
The six of you represent your groups. 

105
00:04:00,919 --> 00:04:03,049
Let's start with Sejeong, please greet the viewers 

106
00:04:03,049 --> 00:04:05,619
the way your group does. 

107
00:04:05,619 --> 00:04:08,319
- Okay. May I begin? / - Yes. 

108
00:04:08,349 --> 00:04:10,379
Standby and go. 

109
00:04:10,649 --> 00:04:12,389
Hello, I'm a member of Gugudan. 

110
00:04:12,389 --> 00:04:14,349
- She's cute. / - That was good. 

111
00:04:14,349 --> 00:04:16,779
- "Standby and go." / - It looked like she slated. 

112
00:04:16,779 --> 00:04:18,149
Standby and go. 

113
00:04:18,149 --> 00:04:20,919
- I became famous as an I.O.I member. / - That's right. 

114
00:04:20,919 --> 00:04:24,779
I hope Gugudan will become as famous as I.O.I, 

115
00:04:24,779 --> 00:04:27,079
- so I'm here to promote Gugudan. / - I see. 

116
00:04:27,079 --> 00:04:29,649
- Gugudan is the talk of the town. / - Really? 

117
00:04:30,219 --> 00:04:31,819
I didn't know that. 

118
00:04:31,819 --> 00:04:33,149
- I'm sorry. / - You just made a guess, right? 

119
00:04:33,149 --> 00:04:34,779
I think he just said it without thinking. 

120
00:04:35,479 --> 00:04:37,849
How do people like your group? 

121
00:04:37,849 --> 00:04:40,889
- Our group name is very popular. / - Exactly. 

122
00:04:40,889 --> 00:04:43,349
Your group is ranked high on the internet hit list. 

123
00:04:43,349 --> 00:04:45,219
- Are you the leader of your group? / - No. 

124
00:04:45,219 --> 00:04:47,519
- You're not? / - One Times Table is the leader. 

125
00:04:47,519 --> 00:04:49,419
Is that so? What is your nickname? 

126
00:04:49,419 --> 00:04:51,479
- I'm Three Times Table. / - Oh, I see. 

127
00:04:51,479 --> 00:04:53,319
That number refers to your nickname. 

128
00:04:53,319 --> 00:04:54,749
That's unique. 

129
00:04:54,749 --> 00:04:56,579
- We have nine members. / - I see. 

130
00:04:56,579 --> 00:04:59,819
- I've been a fan of hers. / - Since I.O.I? 

131
00:04:59,819 --> 00:05:01,549
- Yes, since she was a member of I.O.I. / - Thank you. 

132
00:05:01,549 --> 00:05:03,979
Thank you. Thank you. 

133
00:05:04,649 --> 00:05:06,279
Sejeong, what do you think of Sunny? 

134
00:05:06,279 --> 00:05:09,579
I watched her on a program called "Hero". 

135
00:05:09,579 --> 00:05:12,679
- I really enjoyed the show. / - "Hero"? 

136
00:05:12,679 --> 00:05:13,949
It's "Invincible Youth". 

137
00:05:13,949 --> 00:05:15,119
Oh, that's right. 

138
00:05:15,119 --> 00:05:17,179
- Oh, that's right. I'm sorry. / - "Invincible Youth". 

139
00:05:18,419 --> 00:05:20,519
(She's scared.) 

140
00:05:20,889 --> 00:05:23,979
- Sejeong got so baffled. / - "Oh, that's right." 

141
00:05:23,979 --> 00:05:25,619
"Oh, that's right. I'm sorry." 

142
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:28,379
- She sounded like a man. / - She spoke like my friend. 

143
00:05:28,379 --> 00:05:30,379
- Where are you from? / - I'm from Jeolla Province. 

144
00:05:30,379 --> 00:05:31,479
- I see. / - Me, too. 

145
00:05:31,479 --> 00:05:32,679
- Really? / - Where in Jeolla Province? 

146
00:05:32,679 --> 00:05:35,719
- I'm from Yeosu. / - What about you, Sejeong? 

147
00:05:35,719 --> 00:05:37,679
- I'm from Gimje. / - Oh, Gimje? 

148
00:05:37,679 --> 00:05:39,619
- Oh, she's from Gimje. / - I see. 

149
00:05:39,619 --> 00:05:41,849
- I'm from Gimje. / - I see. 

150
00:05:41,849 --> 00:05:44,449
Up next is Yerin of GFriend. 

151
00:05:44,449 --> 00:05:45,849
Since we had our debut, 

152
00:05:45,849 --> 00:05:47,449
(She speaks in a dialect.) 

153
00:05:47,449 --> 00:05:49,219
we don't have our own way of saying hello. 

154
00:05:49,219 --> 00:05:51,549
- So we just say hello like this. / - Okay. 

155
00:05:51,979 --> 00:05:54,749
- Hello, I'm Yerin of GFriend. / - That's just normal. 

156
00:05:54,749 --> 00:05:57,819
How about, "I'm your girlfriend"? 

157
00:05:57,819 --> 00:05:59,479
- That's funny. / - That's prosaic. 

158
00:05:59,479 --> 00:06:02,019
- That's silly. / - "I'm your girlfriend." 

159
00:06:02,579 --> 00:06:04,319
- That's too predictable. / - Exactly. 

160
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:06,719
- That's not good at all. / - "I'm your girlfriend." 

161
00:06:06,719 --> 00:06:08,419
- How about that? / - Oh, my goodness. 

162
00:06:08,419 --> 00:06:10,919
It's unique that they don't have their own chant. 

163
00:06:10,919 --> 00:06:12,449
- That's right. / - Do you know 

164
00:06:12,449 --> 00:06:15,449
the number of streams that "Me Gustas Tu" has now? 

165
00:06:15,579 --> 00:06:16,949
- How many? / - It's 100 million. 

166
00:06:16,949 --> 00:06:19,319
- Wow. / - That's amazing. 

167
00:06:19,319 --> 00:06:20,549
100 million streams... 

168
00:06:20,549 --> 00:06:23,019
How much did they earn if it's one cent per stream? 

169
00:06:23,079 --> 00:06:24,619
You think about the money they earned. 

170
00:06:24,619 --> 00:06:26,049
It's one million dollars. 

171
00:06:27,549 --> 00:06:30,979
- It's a simple multiplication. / - It's not difficult. 

172
00:06:30,979 --> 00:06:33,119
- It's easy to calculate. / - It's one million dollars. 

173
00:06:33,549 --> 00:06:34,849
Myungsoo embarrassed us. 

174
00:06:35,249 --> 00:06:37,979
- You must be really happy. / - How do you feel? 

175
00:06:37,979 --> 00:06:39,179
I feel really... 

176
00:06:39,679 --> 00:06:41,219
- The script says... / - You feel like you're flying? 

177
00:06:41,219 --> 00:06:43,819
I really feel like I'm flying. 

178
00:06:45,649 --> 00:06:47,249
(As her song gets one million streams,) 

179
00:06:47,249 --> 00:06:48,949
(she feels like she's flying.) 

180
00:06:49,379 --> 00:06:51,079
You don't always have to stick to the script. 

181
00:06:51,679 --> 00:06:53,749
- She promoted her group's new song. / - I know. 

182
00:06:53,749 --> 00:06:55,579
What was that? 

183
00:06:55,579 --> 00:06:59,149
I heard that you have a reason for coming today. 

184
00:06:59,149 --> 00:07:01,549
- Now that my group is famous, / - Right. 

185
00:07:01,549 --> 00:07:03,679
I want people to know more about me, too. 

186
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:05,649
- Aren't you the host of a music show? / - Yes, I am. 

187
00:07:05,679 --> 00:07:07,249
- Wow. / - I know that. 

188
00:07:07,379 --> 00:07:08,419
- Wow. / - Wow. 

189
00:07:09,749 --> 00:07:10,949
(They giggle.) 

190
00:07:11,949 --> 00:07:14,479
(However, the hosts seem baffled.) 

191
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:15,979
It's really awkward at the beginning. 

192
00:07:16,879 --> 00:07:19,279
- I knew it. / - There's nothing we can do. 

193
00:07:19,279 --> 00:07:21,119
- That's right. / - It'll last for about 20 minutes. 

194
00:07:21,119 --> 00:07:22,979
(It's a feast of girlish reactions.) 

195
00:07:23,249 --> 00:07:24,679
Let's see how Laboum will greet the viewers. 

196
00:07:24,679 --> 00:07:27,479
In three, two, one. You're into me. 

197
00:07:27,479 --> 00:07:30,979
You're into me. Hello, I'm a member of Laboum. 

198
00:07:30,979 --> 00:07:34,219
- Goodness. He loves it. / - Oh, my goodness. 

199
00:07:34,219 --> 00:07:36,549
- It's not that I loved it. / - He loves it. 

200
00:07:36,549 --> 00:07:37,579
I felt embarrassed to see that. 

201
00:07:37,979 --> 00:07:38,979
(She imitates Solbin.) 

202
00:07:38,979 --> 00:07:41,579
- It was a little embarrassing. / - I like that. 

203
00:07:41,579 --> 00:07:42,949
Could you show us again? 

204
00:07:42,949 --> 00:07:45,419
In three, two, one. You're into me. Hello. 

205
00:07:45,419 --> 00:07:47,119
- "You're into me." / - Jaeseok, how about you try it? 

206
00:07:47,579 --> 00:07:50,419
- Please? / - I don't think I can do that. 

207
00:07:50,419 --> 00:07:53,379
Solbin, you think people don't know about Laboum. 

208
00:07:53,379 --> 00:07:56,119
That's right. When people hear our group name, 

209
00:07:56,119 --> 00:07:57,879
they think of the movie "La Boum". 

210
00:07:57,879 --> 00:08:01,279
- The movie starring Sophie Marceau. / - Yes. 

211
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:02,619
("La Boum" starring Sophie Marceau) 

212
00:08:02,819 --> 00:08:06,319
- Welcome to "Music Bank". / - "Music Bank". 

213
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:08,619
- Hello, I'm Minhyuk. / - Hello, I'm Solbin. 

214
00:08:08,819 --> 00:08:12,849
I sang the theme songs of about 20 dramas 

215
00:08:12,849 --> 00:08:14,919
including "Master's Sun", "I Can Hear Your Voice", 

216
00:08:14,919 --> 00:08:17,619
"Reply 1988", "Bridal Mask" and "Cantabile Tomorrow". 

217
00:08:17,619 --> 00:08:18,619
- Wow. / - Is that true? 

218
00:08:18,619 --> 00:08:21,549
I'm called "Girls' Generation for drama theme songs". 

219
00:08:21,549 --> 00:08:24,419
- You sang all of them? / - Her hairstyle is unique. 

220
00:08:24,419 --> 00:08:27,349
I call this hairstyle "Little Mermaid Hair". 

221
00:08:27,349 --> 00:08:29,149
- It's the color of grapefruit. / - Grapefruit... 

222
00:08:29,149 --> 00:08:31,249
- You dyed your eyebrows, too. / - That's right. 

223
00:08:31,249 --> 00:08:32,319
She dyed her eyebrows, too. 

224
00:08:32,419 --> 00:08:34,279
I met Hyeongyeong earlier today. 

225
00:08:34,279 --> 00:08:37,489
- We met at a hair salon. / - I thought she copied me. 

226
00:08:39,349 --> 00:08:40,489
Her hair color is... 

227
00:08:40,489 --> 00:08:42,779
That's good. She's funny. I like her. 

228
00:08:42,779 --> 00:08:44,019
She makes the show fun. 

229
00:08:44,019 --> 00:08:46,749
I once dyed my hair pink like her. 

230
00:08:46,749 --> 00:08:47,989
I remember that. 

231
00:08:47,989 --> 00:08:51,349
The color came off, so I had to dye my hair every day. 

232
00:08:51,349 --> 00:08:52,489
I've been doing the same. 

233
00:08:52,489 --> 00:08:55,379
How do you maintain the hair color? 

234
00:08:55,379 --> 00:08:57,679
I got a hair manicure this morning. 

235
00:08:57,679 --> 00:09:00,119
My hair dye runs down my cheek while I'm rehearsing. 

236
00:09:00,119 --> 00:09:01,219
You got a manicure? 

237
00:09:01,219 --> 00:09:03,779
- It's a hair manicure. / - It's for nourishing hair 

238
00:09:03,779 --> 00:09:05,219
and coating the color. 

239
00:09:05,219 --> 00:09:06,619
How often do you need to get a hair manicure? 

240
00:09:06,619 --> 00:09:10,049
I get a hair manicure once every four or five days. 

241
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:11,049
My goodness. 

242
00:09:11,049 --> 00:09:12,519
I want to stop it 

243
00:09:12,519 --> 00:09:14,019
- because it damages my hair, / - Seriously... 

244
00:09:14,019 --> 00:09:16,319
but I can't because people recognize me by my hair. 

245
00:09:16,319 --> 00:09:18,319
- I see. / - I think you need to dye the roots. 

246
00:09:18,319 --> 00:09:20,279
I need to bleach the roots three times. 

247
00:09:20,279 --> 00:09:22,779
- It's painful. / - That's right. It hurts. 

248
00:09:22,779 --> 00:09:24,279
- It must hurt. / - So I do it once every two weeks. 

249
00:09:24,279 --> 00:09:26,819
- I tried all rainbow colors. / - That's right. 

250
00:09:26,819 --> 00:09:29,349
- It takes a lot of efforts as she said. / - Yes. 

251
00:09:29,349 --> 00:09:30,379
I remember when you dyed your hair purple. 

252
00:09:30,379 --> 00:09:31,719
Right. I dyed my hair purple once. 

253
00:09:31,719 --> 00:09:33,679
I used to dye it by myself. 

254
00:09:33,879 --> 00:09:35,489
- At home? / - Yes. 

255
00:09:35,489 --> 00:09:37,679
Why? You could have done it at a hair salon. 

256
00:09:37,679 --> 00:09:40,579
I had no time. We finished working late at night, 

257
00:09:40,579 --> 00:09:44,489
and we went to the hair salon early in the morning. 

258
00:09:44,489 --> 00:09:47,419
Sometimes, we go to the hair salon at midnight. 

259
00:09:47,749 --> 00:09:51,249
It must be very hard to be an idol singer. 

260
00:09:51,249 --> 00:09:52,579
I guess idol singers age quickly. 

261
00:09:52,579 --> 00:09:54,379
You're talking like an announcer again. 

262
00:09:54,379 --> 00:09:55,849
(Park Myungsoo Talk Show) 

263
00:09:55,849 --> 00:09:57,619
He keeps doing that today. 

264
00:09:57,619 --> 00:09:58,879
Is it going to be the old version or the recent one? 

265
00:09:58,879 --> 00:10:01,179
- Would you like the old one? / - Yes, please. 

266
00:10:01,779 --> 00:10:03,149
Like you did when you debuted. 

267
00:10:04,549 --> 00:10:05,779
(She laughs out of embarrassment.) 

268
00:10:05,779 --> 00:10:07,879
- She's not nervous. / - Show us the old version. 

269
00:10:07,879 --> 00:10:08,989
You need to go back to the past. 

270
00:10:09,119 --> 00:10:10,879
Could you please stand up and show us? 

271
00:10:10,989 --> 00:10:13,279
Okay. I think it'd be better. 

272
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:14,489
I think it'd be better if you sit down. 

273
00:10:14,489 --> 00:10:15,989
I'm sorry. 

274
00:10:15,989 --> 00:10:17,949
What's wrong with standing up? 

275
00:10:17,949 --> 00:10:20,219
- She looks great. / - You look like 

276
00:10:20,219 --> 00:10:23,489
- you're about to go on stage. / - I look okay today. 

277
00:10:23,579 --> 00:10:25,049
- Please show us. / - Which camera should I look at? 

278
00:10:25,119 --> 00:10:26,679
- That one? / - She said, "I look okay." 

279
00:10:26,779 --> 00:10:28,579
- She looks good, but... / - She looks pretty. 

280
00:10:28,579 --> 00:10:29,649
You should've said it first. 

281
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:32,379
Hello, I'm the energizer of Girls' Generation. 

282
00:10:32,819 --> 00:10:34,149
(She looks bubbly and cheery.) 

283
00:10:34,149 --> 00:10:35,319
I'm Sunny. 

284
00:10:36,049 --> 00:10:37,079
That's good. 

285
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:39,249
That's good. This is why she's a legend. 

286
00:10:39,249 --> 00:10:41,049
(This is why she's a legend.) 

287
00:10:41,349 --> 00:10:42,879
Girls' Generation marks nine years since the debut. 

288
00:10:42,879 --> 00:10:44,989
- That's right. / - Wow, that's amazing. 

289
00:10:44,989 --> 00:10:45,989
Thank you. 

290
00:10:46,489 --> 00:10:47,949
Girls' Generation was ranked number one 

291
00:10:47,949 --> 00:10:49,379
the most on music programs. 

292
00:10:49,379 --> 00:10:50,679
They won 100 times on music programs. 

293
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:55,449
Since Girls' Generation, 150 girl groups debuted. 

294
00:10:55,449 --> 00:10:57,619
- Really? / - Five of them are here today. 

295
00:10:57,619 --> 00:10:59,319
Did you dream of becoming a singer watching them? 

296
00:10:59,319 --> 00:11:00,319
Sejeong, please tell us. 

297
00:11:00,379 --> 00:11:02,849
There's an essential step 

298
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:05,379
that trainees go through. 

299
00:11:05,479 --> 00:11:06,919
I'm sure you all practiced these songs. 

300
00:11:06,979 --> 00:11:08,549
"Into the New World" by Girls' Generation and... 

301
00:11:09,149 --> 00:11:10,719
("Into the New World" is Girls' Generation's) 

302
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:12,479
(debut song released in 2007.) 

303
00:11:17,019 --> 00:11:18,879
- Trainees practice the dance. / - That's right. 

304
00:11:18,879 --> 00:11:22,279
I grew up watching Girls' Generation. 

305
00:11:22,279 --> 00:11:27,019
The prettiest girls in my classroom formed a group 

306
00:11:27,579 --> 00:11:29,549
- for a school talent show. / - Were you one of them? 

307
00:11:29,579 --> 00:11:30,879
Yes, I was the leader of the group. 

308
00:11:30,879 --> 00:11:34,349
- She keeps bragging. / - She was the prettiest girl. 

309
00:11:34,349 --> 00:11:37,779
It feels like we're shooting for "Immortal Songs". 

310
00:11:38,049 --> 00:11:39,779
It's like "Sunny Special" on "Immortal Songs". 

311
00:11:39,779 --> 00:11:42,119
- It looks like... / - They're singing Sunny's songs. 

312
00:11:42,279 --> 00:11:43,479
Sunny is sitting on the legendary singer's seat, 

313
00:11:43,479 --> 00:11:45,349
and they sing her songs. 

314
00:11:45,579 --> 00:11:46,749
It looks like she says, "That's good enough." 

315
00:11:47,179 --> 00:11:50,379
- "I'm not offended." / - Sunny felt pressured 

316
00:11:50,379 --> 00:11:52,149
- when she was invited to Happy Together. / - Why? 

317
00:11:52,149 --> 00:11:55,619
I wish you had invited more experienced singers. 

318
00:11:55,619 --> 00:11:57,379
But you invited newcomers 

319
00:11:57,379 --> 00:12:00,279
- Right. / - and I'm the only experienced singer here. 

320
00:12:00,279 --> 00:12:02,119
The other guests are 

321
00:12:02,149 --> 00:12:06,019
- so young, pretty and refreshing. / - I see. 

322
00:12:06,379 --> 00:12:10,379
It seems Solji is confused about her position. 

323
00:12:10,419 --> 00:12:12,519
- She's an experienced singer. / - That's right. 

324
00:12:12,779 --> 00:12:14,679
Sunny and Solji debuted before the others. 

325
00:12:14,679 --> 00:12:15,779
They're both experienced singers. 

326
00:12:15,779 --> 00:12:17,779
- I debuted in 2012. / - I see. 

327
00:12:18,119 --> 00:12:20,979
Although Solji debuted later than Sunny, 

328
00:12:20,979 --> 00:12:23,519
- they're the same age. / - How old are you? 

329
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:25,479
- I was born in 1989. / - Me, too. 

330
00:12:25,479 --> 00:12:26,879
- You, too, right? / - You two are the same age? 

331
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:28,179
Have you two known each other? 

332
00:12:28,519 --> 00:12:30,649
- I haven't met her before. / - Really? 

333
00:12:31,079 --> 00:12:33,149
- Goodness. / - Who said hello first? 

334
00:12:33,679 --> 00:12:34,849
Did you two meet each other for the first time here? 

335
00:12:34,849 --> 00:12:36,019
- I said hello first. / - I said hello 

336
00:12:36,219 --> 00:12:38,849
when I saw her in front of the restroom. 

337
00:12:38,849 --> 00:12:41,679
- Did you say hello to her first? / - In the restroom, 

338
00:12:41,679 --> 00:12:43,279
- At the same time... / - we said hello to each other. 

339
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:45,319
- As soon as we saw each other. / - Didn't you wait? 

340
00:12:45,319 --> 00:12:47,679
No, I said hi as soon as I saw her 

341
00:12:47,679 --> 00:12:49,219
- in the restroom. / - That's right. 

342
00:12:49,479 --> 00:12:52,479
I heard that Solji debuted earlier than Sunny. 

343
00:12:52,479 --> 00:12:53,879
I heard that, too. 

344
00:12:54,379 --> 00:12:56,349
- She was a member of 2NB. / - It was a duo. 

345
00:12:56,349 --> 00:12:58,419
- It was a duo. / - Please stop talking about it. 

346
00:12:58,419 --> 00:12:59,979
- You're my senior, then. / - No. 

347
00:12:59,979 --> 00:13:01,479
- You're my senior. / - No. 

348
00:13:02,419 --> 00:13:03,479
You're my senior. 

349
00:13:03,479 --> 00:13:06,279
- She debuted earlier. / - I didn't know that. 

350
00:13:06,279 --> 00:13:08,019
- Oh, my. / - Greet her properly. 

351
00:13:08,679 --> 00:13:10,119
- Hello. / - Hello. 

352
00:13:10,219 --> 00:13:11,579
Let's join them. 

353
00:13:11,979 --> 00:13:14,049
(They all bow to Solji.) 

354
00:13:14,049 --> 00:13:15,679
- Hello. / - Solji. 

355
00:13:16,479 --> 00:13:18,579
- Greet her properly. / - You're like Uhm Junghwa. 

356
00:13:18,749 --> 00:13:20,079
That's ridiculous. 

357
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:22,049
I heard you debuted early in the 2000s. 

358
00:13:22,579 --> 00:13:24,849
In 2006, I debuted as a member of 2NB, 

359
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:28,449
- a female duo. / - A duo? 

360
00:13:30,779 --> 00:13:32,749
(Ten years ago,) 

361
00:13:32,749 --> 00:13:35,419
(she debuted through her promotional video.) 

362
00:13:35,419 --> 00:13:38,819
Hello, I'm Solji of 2NB, a female duo. 

363
00:13:39,049 --> 00:13:42,779
I released my first solo song "Because I Hate You". 

364
00:13:42,949 --> 00:13:45,279
You released a lot of albums before EXID. 

365
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:47,619
- Yes, I did. / - Didn't you release a dozen? 

366
00:13:47,619 --> 00:13:50,519
- I released about 23 albums. / - 23? 

367
00:13:50,519 --> 00:13:52,379
- Wow. / - Why haven't we heard some before? 

368
00:13:52,379 --> 00:13:53,379
Because all of her albums flopped. 

369
00:13:53,849 --> 00:13:55,049
Please don't say that. 

370
00:13:55,049 --> 00:13:56,319
But it's the truth. 

371
00:13:56,319 --> 00:13:57,749
How could 23 albums flop? 

372
00:13:57,749 --> 00:14:00,049
Don't say such a mean thing. 

373
00:14:00,049 --> 00:14:01,419
I was like a singing machine. 

374
00:14:01,419 --> 00:14:03,679
- It's true that her albums flopped. / - It's true. 

375
00:14:03,679 --> 00:14:06,519
- How else can I put it? / - I was surprised. 

376
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:09,549
- She achieved recognition. / - She's amazing. 

377
00:14:09,579 --> 00:14:12,419
- It means she's a good singer. / - That's right. 

378
00:14:12,419 --> 00:14:14,349
I think Solji's agency is amazing. 

379
00:14:14,349 --> 00:14:16,079
Solji failed 23 times already, 

380
00:14:16,219 --> 00:14:18,449
- but they gave her another chance. / - Please stop it. 

381
00:14:18,779 --> 00:14:22,279
- Please. / - Some of them must've been against it 

382
00:14:22,279 --> 00:14:24,919
- because she failed many times. / - In fact, 

383
00:14:24,949 --> 00:14:27,119
EXID was about to give up 

384
00:14:27,119 --> 00:14:29,179
as the song "Up and Down" wasn't a hit at first. 

385
00:14:29,179 --> 00:14:31,119
- But it became a hit later. / - That's right. 

386
00:14:31,119 --> 00:14:32,919
- Exactly. / - I heard 

387
00:14:32,949 --> 00:14:34,979
- that was the last chance for you. / - That's right. 

388
00:14:34,979 --> 00:14:36,649
If the song had flopped, we would've broken up. 

389
00:14:36,679 --> 00:14:38,279
- You would have? / - But they made it. 

390
00:14:38,279 --> 00:14:40,149
- At first, it wasn't successful. / - That's right. 

391
00:14:40,179 --> 00:14:43,649
- It wasn't. / - We were thinking of what to do next. 

392
00:14:43,649 --> 00:14:46,119
- The video clip came up. / - The clip of Hani came up, 

393
00:14:46,349 --> 00:14:49,519
and the song was ranked first in the music charts. 

394
00:14:49,779 --> 00:14:51,519
That's amazing. 

395
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:55,219
Another song flopped and your group was about 

396
00:14:55,219 --> 00:14:57,319
to break up. But then, you became popular. 

397
00:14:57,319 --> 00:14:58,449
That's right. 

398
00:14:58,779 --> 00:15:01,279
I released 30 albums including EXID albums. 

399
00:15:01,949 --> 00:15:03,019
That's amazing. 

400
00:15:03,979 --> 00:15:06,979
You said you and Sejeong have a lot in common. 

401
00:15:06,979 --> 00:15:08,779
- You have a brother, right? / - Yes. 

402
00:15:08,779 --> 00:15:11,979
- She said she's close with her brother. / - I did. 

403
00:15:11,979 --> 00:15:14,249
- I'm close with my brother, too. / - Really? 

404
00:15:14,249 --> 00:15:16,449
We're both lead vocalists. 

405
00:15:16,579 --> 00:15:19,279
- How about personalities? / - She seems outgoing. 

406
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:21,819
- I'm outgoing. / - We have similar personalities. 

407
00:15:22,479 --> 00:15:25,479
I thought they have a lot in common, but they don't. 

408
00:15:25,479 --> 00:15:27,349
They just have a few similarities. 

409
00:15:27,349 --> 00:15:29,179
There must be about 150 people similar to her. 

410
00:15:29,179 --> 00:15:31,779
- Many women have brothers. / - A lot of women do. 

411
00:15:31,779 --> 00:15:33,979
- Don't many singers have brothers? / - Listen to me. 

412
00:15:33,979 --> 00:15:34,979
- I have a brother, too. / - I have a brother, too. 

413
00:15:34,979 --> 00:15:35,979
Me, too. 

414
00:15:37,179 --> 00:15:38,619
I have a brother, too. 

415
00:15:38,619 --> 00:15:42,249
- Are you outgoing? / - Yes, I'm hairy, too. 

416
00:15:43,479 --> 00:15:44,579
(She made a lame pun.) 

417
00:15:44,579 --> 00:15:46,519
- What are you talking about? / - Why did you say that? 

418
00:15:46,519 --> 00:15:48,319
That's funny. Keep going like that. 

419
00:15:48,319 --> 00:15:49,519
(Solbin shows potential as a good entertainer.) 

420
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:53,219
Popular girl groups perform a lot of gigs. 

421
00:15:53,219 --> 00:15:55,219
You must have had a dozen gigs a day, right? 

422
00:15:55,419 --> 00:15:56,749
We performed up to five gigs a day. 

423
00:15:56,979 --> 00:15:58,119
A day? 

424
00:15:58,219 --> 00:16:00,879
What was the most memorable event for you? 

425
00:16:00,879 --> 00:16:02,619
There are different events. 

426
00:16:02,619 --> 00:16:04,579
First, we perform at military camps. 

427
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:06,519
- Is that so? / - Soldiers always go crazy. 

428
00:16:06,779 --> 00:16:08,049
Do you say hello differently? 

429
00:16:08,049 --> 00:16:09,279
Yes, we speak in a higher pitch. 

430
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:11,219
How do you say hello at a military camp? 

431
00:16:11,219 --> 00:16:12,849
We try to be cuter. 

432
00:16:12,849 --> 00:16:16,079
- How? / - "Hello, we're Girls' Generation." 

433
00:16:16,319 --> 00:16:17,679
(That's how to become popular among soldiers.) 

434
00:16:17,679 --> 00:16:19,119
How about a local event? 

435
00:16:19,119 --> 00:16:21,679
We greet like this. "Hello, we're Girls' Generation." 

436
00:16:21,679 --> 00:16:24,279
We greet cheerfully for the elderly people. 

437
00:16:24,279 --> 00:16:26,279
- What else? / - There are corporate events. 

438
00:16:26,279 --> 00:16:27,879
Oh, corporate events? 

439
00:16:27,879 --> 00:16:29,479
Isn't it hard to perform at a corporate event? 

440
00:16:29,479 --> 00:16:31,049
- It must be hard to even greet. / - In those events 

441
00:16:31,119 --> 00:16:33,049
- people eat formally. / - That's right. 

442
00:16:33,049 --> 00:16:35,749
- People don't cheer at all. / - It's awkward to greet. 

443
00:16:35,749 --> 00:16:37,879
Although they don't cheer, they enjoy the performance. 

444
00:16:37,879 --> 00:16:40,049
I saw an executive tapping his foot 

445
00:16:40,049 --> 00:16:44,449
with a solemn look while a girl group was performing. 

446
00:16:44,449 --> 00:16:46,349
It's actually because 

447
00:16:46,349 --> 00:16:49,349
- He wanted to have fun. / - executives want to 

448
00:16:49,349 --> 00:16:51,579
- have fun. / - Exactly. But they can't. 

449
00:16:51,579 --> 00:16:53,679
- They keep their faces. / - They have their reasons. 

450
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:55,119
They could be in trouble. 

451
00:16:55,119 --> 00:16:58,579
They can't just take off their ties and dance. 

452
00:16:58,579 --> 00:17:01,049
(They can't have fun like Myungsoo.) 

453
00:17:01,689 --> 00:17:04,949
Chahee, does your group change your way of greeting? 

454
00:17:05,619 --> 00:17:08,119
- No, we don't do that. / - I see. 

455
00:17:08,689 --> 00:17:09,689
What a shame. 

456
00:17:10,049 --> 00:17:12,379
- She missed an opportunity. / - It was a good chance. 

457
00:17:12,379 --> 00:17:14,519
- That's a shame. / - I gave her a chance. 

458
00:17:14,519 --> 00:17:16,279
I'm disappointed. 

459
00:17:16,579 --> 00:17:18,419
I felt embarrassed as the host. 

460
00:17:18,419 --> 00:17:20,619
I felt like my heart dropped. 

461
00:17:20,619 --> 00:17:23,049
You can't become a star if you go on like this. 

462
00:17:23,049 --> 00:17:25,319
- I'm sorry. I think we have another version. / - What? 

463
00:17:25,319 --> 00:17:26,579
- I think we have another version. / - What a shame. 

464
00:17:26,579 --> 00:17:28,689
- It's too late. / - You already missed the chance. 

465
00:17:28,689 --> 00:17:33,079
Solji, how do soldiers cheer when EXID performs? 

466
00:17:33,149 --> 00:17:35,689
As they have low pitched voices, 

467
00:17:35,689 --> 00:17:36,779
it sounds like they're shouting in a cave. 

468
00:17:37,249 --> 00:17:39,379
Up and down. Up and down. 

469
00:17:39,379 --> 00:17:40,949
They sound like this. You've seen them, right? 

470
00:17:40,949 --> 00:17:42,219
Shall we show how it must sound? 

471
00:17:42,419 --> 00:17:44,319
Up and down. Up and down. 

472
00:17:44,379 --> 00:17:45,879
(Love EXID like you love your country.) 

473
00:17:46,079 --> 00:17:47,349
(Salute to Solji!) 

474
00:17:48,349 --> 00:17:51,979
(This is how soldiers cheer when EXID performs.) 

475
00:17:51,979 --> 00:17:55,779
(They even dance in perfect sync.) 

476
00:17:57,579 --> 00:17:59,979
- That's right. / - What do middle-aged fans do? 

477
00:17:59,979 --> 00:18:01,649
- What do they do? / - Yerin, please tell us. 

478
00:18:01,779 --> 00:18:05,549
Middle-aged fans smile happily in the audience. 

479
00:18:07,079 --> 00:18:08,519
They smile like this in the beginning. 

480
00:18:08,849 --> 00:18:11,349
They shout really loudly instead of dancing. 

481
00:18:11,379 --> 00:18:13,479
"Wow, they're GFriend!" 

482
00:18:13,949 --> 00:18:15,049
They shout really loudly. 

483
00:18:15,049 --> 00:18:16,379
(They cheer in a low pitched voice.) 

484
00:18:16,379 --> 00:18:18,349
They usually try to have a conversation. 

485
00:18:18,349 --> 00:18:20,219
"Yerin, have you had a meal?" 

486
00:18:20,219 --> 00:18:22,949
- That's right. / - "Yerin, you look pretty today!" 

487
00:18:22,949 --> 00:18:24,379
They say that a lot. 

488
00:18:24,379 --> 00:18:26,779
They even ask, "Have you recovered from your cold?" 

489
00:18:26,779 --> 00:18:27,949
What about Laboum? 

490
00:18:27,949 --> 00:18:30,349
They always bring large cameras 

491
00:18:30,349 --> 00:18:32,719
- with telephoto lens. / - I know. They are amazing. 

492
00:18:32,879 --> 00:18:37,719
- One of our male fans is charismatic. / - I see. 

493
00:18:37,779 --> 00:18:42,479
Yesterday, he came up to me before "Music Bank" began. 

494
00:18:42,519 --> 00:18:45,049
He said he heard I'd appear on this show. 

495
00:18:45,049 --> 00:18:46,619
I said, "That's right." 

496
00:18:46,979 --> 00:18:49,949
- He said, "Don't do anything weird." / - My goodness. 

497
00:18:49,949 --> 00:18:51,849
Like a father would say to his daughter. 

498
00:18:51,849 --> 00:18:54,949
He said I should be funny without doing funny acts. 

499
00:18:54,949 --> 00:18:56,979
- That's really difficult. / - He's quite objective. 

500
00:18:56,979 --> 00:18:57,979
That's really difficult to do. 

501
00:18:57,979 --> 00:19:00,349
- It's hard to be funny that way. / - Exactly. 

502
00:19:00,349 --> 00:19:02,579
Chahee, this is your second chance. 

503
00:19:02,579 --> 00:19:03,779
(She has another chance to talk.) 

504
00:19:03,779 --> 00:19:05,079
Please tell us a funny story when you did a gig. 

505
00:19:05,749 --> 00:19:08,689
- You have a story, right? / - Yes, I do. 

506
00:19:08,689 --> 00:19:13,379
I have a very devoted fan... I'm so nervous. 

507
00:19:13,879 --> 00:19:15,549
- Just relax. / - She's cute. 

508
00:19:16,049 --> 00:19:20,189
He follows wherever I go. You all have a fan like him. 

509
00:19:20,189 --> 00:19:21,749
- Yes, we all do. / - Right. 

510
00:19:21,749 --> 00:19:22,979
I wanted to say that I have one, too. 

511
00:19:22,979 --> 00:19:24,079
(That's the end of the story.) 

512
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:26,519
- Is that all? / - I'm going to 

513
00:19:26,579 --> 00:19:29,319
make up a story for her. I'll be quick. 

514
00:19:29,319 --> 00:19:30,849
- Please do that. / - I can 

515
00:19:30,849 --> 00:19:32,819
make up a story for her in no time. 

516
00:19:32,819 --> 00:19:34,579
Chahee wanted to tell us that she has a fan. 

517
00:19:34,579 --> 00:19:36,819
Among members of MelodyDay are 

518
00:19:36,919 --> 00:19:39,479
the niece of Jang Donggun and daughter of Ahn Jihwan. 

519
00:19:39,479 --> 00:19:41,689
- Really? / - That's how I heard about the group. 

520
00:19:41,689 --> 00:19:44,189
- Chahee, are you one of them? / - No, I am not. 

521
00:19:44,279 --> 00:19:46,879
The second oldest member of MelodyDay, Yoomin 

522
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:49,519
is a niece of Jang Donggun. 

523
00:19:49,819 --> 00:19:55,479
Yein is voice actor Ahn Jihwan's daughter. 

524
00:19:55,949 --> 00:19:58,189
I am a daughter of my mom and dad. 

525
00:19:58,619 --> 00:20:00,019
Chahee, I heard that 

526
00:20:00,019 --> 00:20:02,719
your agency encourages you to be involved in a scandal. 

527
00:20:02,779 --> 00:20:04,049
That's right. 

528
00:20:04,249 --> 00:20:08,049
Since MelodyDay is not very famous, 

529
00:20:08,689 --> 00:20:10,879
they told us it is better to cause a scandal. 

530
00:20:11,419 --> 00:20:13,319
- That's ridiculous. / - Is that the reason? 

531
00:20:13,319 --> 00:20:15,619
I can't believe they told you that. 

532
00:20:15,619 --> 00:20:16,719
Do they let you go to clubs? 

533
00:20:16,819 --> 00:20:19,049
We were told to go to clubs. 

534
00:20:19,049 --> 00:20:20,349
- We were told to go / - The president said that? 

535
00:20:20,349 --> 00:20:21,649
and enjoy ourselves. 

536
00:20:21,649 --> 00:20:24,819
I sometimes go to clubs with my friends. 

537
00:20:24,919 --> 00:20:28,319
- That's nice. / - Other members are reserved. 

538
00:20:28,419 --> 00:20:30,519
- They go to church on Sundays. / - They do? 

539
00:20:30,579 --> 00:20:33,319
- They always read books in the dormitory. / - Oh my... 

540
00:20:33,319 --> 00:20:34,779
- That's how they are. / - How strange. 

541
00:20:34,779 --> 00:20:35,779
They are preparing to become brides. 

542
00:20:35,779 --> 00:20:38,749
- Is there an article you would like to see? / - Right. 

543
00:20:38,779 --> 00:20:40,449
Which related search words would you like to see? 

544
00:20:40,479 --> 00:20:42,879
I don't know if I should be saying this, 

545
00:20:42,879 --> 00:20:45,249
but I want to announce a relationship to the public. 

546
00:20:45,249 --> 00:20:47,649
- Really? / - Other guests are shocked. 

547
00:20:47,649 --> 00:20:48,919
(That's incredible.) 

548
00:20:48,919 --> 00:20:50,779
- That's unimaginable. / - Really? 

549
00:20:50,779 --> 00:20:53,949
Our agency lets us be free. 

550
00:20:53,949 --> 00:20:55,549
I feel like everyone is too caged in. 

551
00:20:55,649 --> 00:20:58,949
- We really are caged in. / - You are right. 

552
00:20:59,419 --> 00:21:01,149
"We really are caged in." 

553
00:21:01,149 --> 00:21:03,879
She feels strongly about it. "We really are caged in." 

554
00:21:04,479 --> 00:21:07,219
It must be true. "We really are caged in." 

555
00:21:07,619 --> 00:21:10,749
Who do you want to date? 

556
00:21:10,749 --> 00:21:13,419
- Who are you interested in? / - What about Hyunmoo? 

557
00:21:13,419 --> 00:21:14,649
- Hyunmoo and Chahee. / - Are you serious? 

558
00:21:14,779 --> 00:21:17,049
It's not a bad idea. 

559
00:21:17,049 --> 00:21:20,749
Cao Lu and Saeho became quite successful. 

560
00:21:20,949 --> 00:21:23,649
- I want to do the same. / - It's strictly business. 

561
00:21:23,649 --> 00:21:25,249
She is not interested in him. 

562
00:21:26,449 --> 00:21:28,779
Not even by this much. 

563
00:21:28,779 --> 00:21:30,919
She is not interested in him. 

564
00:21:30,919 --> 00:21:32,519
That's not a real relationship. 

565
00:21:33,419 --> 00:21:34,879
She will do anything to succeed. 

566
00:21:34,879 --> 00:21:36,319
(Love and Ambition) 

567
00:21:36,319 --> 00:21:38,949
Is there anyone who caught your eyes? 

568
00:21:39,219 --> 00:21:42,619
There is someone who caught my eyes. 

569
00:21:42,979 --> 00:21:43,979
It's BewhY. 

570
00:21:45,249 --> 00:21:47,249
BewhY and I have nothing in common. 

571
00:21:47,619 --> 00:21:49,379
My ideal type is a man with a nice voice. 

572
00:21:49,379 --> 00:21:52,619
I want him to wake me up every morning with a rap. 

573
00:21:54,219 --> 00:21:56,249
(Do you want rap as a morning alarm?) 

574
00:21:56,779 --> 00:21:58,249
(I can do that for you.) 

575
00:21:59,019 --> 00:22:00,979
I have nothing to lose. 

576
00:22:02,279 --> 00:22:04,149
You haven't gained much either. 

577
00:22:04,679 --> 00:22:07,079
It's too soon to talk about what you will lose. 

578
00:22:07,179 --> 00:22:10,319
- I apologize. / - You haven't gained much. 

579
00:22:10,319 --> 00:22:12,019
You shouldn't talk about what you will lose. 

580
00:22:12,019 --> 00:22:14,149
- You have a negative balance. / - That's right. 

581
00:22:14,149 --> 00:22:17,519
I will work hard today to make it positive. 

582
00:22:17,619 --> 00:22:19,379
I am the only member in the group 

583
00:22:19,379 --> 00:22:21,779
who has never made it on Most Popular Keywords. 

584
00:22:21,849 --> 00:22:24,719
- Never? / - Everyone else in the room has. 

585
00:22:24,819 --> 00:22:27,479
You should do something funny on the show. 

586
00:22:27,479 --> 00:22:29,079
Do you have a special talent? 

587
00:22:29,749 --> 00:22:31,579
Simply appearing on Happy Together may not be enough. 

588
00:22:31,779 --> 00:22:34,219
I will show you the pen beat. 

589
00:22:34,319 --> 00:22:36,349
- What is pen beat? / - It's pen tapping. 

590
00:22:36,619 --> 00:22:39,049
- I am really good at it. / - Please show us. 

591
00:22:39,049 --> 00:22:40,549
- I will give it a go. / - It's her special talent. 

592
00:22:40,549 --> 00:22:42,219
- I can't wait to see it. / - All right. 

593
00:22:43,079 --> 00:22:44,219
Four beats. 

594
00:22:44,319 --> 00:22:46,449
(She starts with four beats.) 

595
00:22:46,449 --> 00:22:47,449
Eight beats. 

596
00:22:48,449 --> 00:22:50,149
(Help me make it on Most Popular Keywords.) 

597
00:22:50,849 --> 00:22:51,919
This is 16 beats. 

598
00:22:53,579 --> 00:22:55,749
I have seen it on the internet. 

599
00:22:55,749 --> 00:22:56,949
Let's see 32 beats. 

600
00:22:56,949 --> 00:22:58,949
- Can you do it? / - This is incredible. 

601
00:22:59,949 --> 00:23:01,949
(She taps 32 beats.) 

602
00:23:01,949 --> 00:23:02,979
She is good. 

603
00:23:03,079 --> 00:23:04,079
(This is incredible.) 

604
00:23:04,079 --> 00:23:05,149
Give us 64 beats. 

605
00:23:05,879 --> 00:23:07,179
This is the most I can do. 

606
00:23:08,419 --> 00:23:09,849
She should have shown us 64 beats. 

607
00:23:09,949 --> 00:23:11,449
Can you pen tap while you sing? 

608
00:23:11,449 --> 00:23:12,779
Would you do it with "Rough"? 

609
00:23:12,779 --> 00:23:15,349
If you sing, I will pen tap. 

610
00:23:15,419 --> 00:23:16,449
Let's begin. 

611
00:23:17,304 --> 00:23:19,634
(A sweet voice) 

612
00:23:19,634 --> 00:23:21,164
(and pen beat meet.) 

613
00:23:21,164 --> 00:23:22,434
(The tapping grows faster.) 

614
00:23:23,804 --> 00:23:25,134
(Like a miracle) 

615
00:23:25,134 --> 00:23:28,304
(One is joyous while the other is flustered.) 

616
00:23:29,604 --> 00:23:31,104
You should sing to the recorded accompaniment. 

617
00:23:31,704 --> 00:23:33,134
The pen beat serves no point. 

618
00:23:33,504 --> 00:23:34,934
There's no point of singing to the pen beat 

619
00:23:34,934 --> 00:23:36,404
when they have a good recorded accompaniment. 

620
00:23:36,404 --> 00:23:38,634
- I feel like I have to follow the beat. / - I know. 

621
00:23:40,934 --> 00:23:42,964
Solbin, are you the funny member in your group? 

622
00:23:43,064 --> 00:23:46,504
Yes, I am the funny member of Laboum. 

623
00:23:47,264 --> 00:23:49,134
For example, 

624
00:23:49,434 --> 00:23:53,104
- I like "dad jokes." / - Dad jokes. 

625
00:23:53,804 --> 00:23:55,964
Saeho, are you single? 

626
00:23:56,064 --> 00:23:58,434
- Yes, I am. / - I am a beagle. 

627
00:24:01,004 --> 00:24:03,234
(Her joke makes everyone freeze.) 

628
00:24:03,234 --> 00:24:05,304
- My goodness. / - What was that? 

629
00:24:05,304 --> 00:24:06,734
I have another one. 

630
00:24:07,064 --> 00:24:11,204
What are the three most dangerous dishes? 

631
00:24:11,964 --> 00:24:14,064
- The most dangerous dishes? / - Yes. Name three. 

632
00:24:14,064 --> 00:24:15,064
There are three. 

633
00:24:15,904 --> 00:24:16,904
- I don't know. / - You don't know, right? 

634
00:24:17,604 --> 00:24:20,304
Chicken, sweet and sour pork and pizza. 

635
00:24:21,934 --> 00:24:24,834
Chicken, sweet and sour pork and pizza. 

636
00:24:25,434 --> 00:24:26,434
(She keeps a straight face.) 

637
00:24:26,934 --> 00:24:28,804
Sunny, you should laugh. 

638
00:24:29,564 --> 00:24:31,534
(She gives a reaction right away.) 

639
00:24:31,934 --> 00:24:34,364
- Is there another one? / - I know one. 

640
00:24:34,364 --> 00:24:35,364
What is it? 

641
00:24:35,664 --> 00:24:38,064
Do you know where physical therapy gets its name from? 

642
00:24:38,604 --> 00:24:39,764
- Physical therapy? / - Yes. 

643
00:24:39,764 --> 00:24:40,764
It involves the body. 

644
00:24:41,164 --> 00:24:42,404
It's because it physically fights off an illness. 

645
00:24:43,564 --> 00:24:44,634
(She is shy.) 

646
00:24:44,634 --> 00:24:45,964
I see. 

647
00:24:47,164 --> 00:24:48,304
(Solbin is impressed.) 

648
00:24:48,304 --> 00:24:51,764
How old are you? 

649
00:24:52,234 --> 00:24:54,664
- I am 21 years old. / - Don't lie. 

650
00:24:54,764 --> 00:24:56,834
- Sejeong, do you have one? / - I have a hard one. 

651
00:24:56,834 --> 00:24:59,234
- You need to use your brain. / - Okay. 

652
00:24:59,234 --> 00:25:00,234
We like such jokes. 

653
00:25:00,234 --> 00:25:02,404
You are driving. 

654
00:25:03,264 --> 00:25:06,404
A person comes out of nowhere and you honk. 

655
00:25:06,534 --> 00:25:08,004
Can you retell the situation in three words? 

656
00:25:08,164 --> 00:25:09,334
Let me try. 

657
00:25:11,964 --> 00:25:14,164
(What will she say?) 

658
00:25:15,934 --> 00:25:17,004
Let me try. 

659
00:25:17,064 --> 00:25:20,304
Vroom. What? Bang! 

660
00:25:20,634 --> 00:25:21,864
How did you know? 

661
00:25:21,964 --> 00:25:23,034
Yes! 

662
00:25:24,434 --> 00:25:25,434
She is good. 

663
00:25:27,104 --> 00:25:28,404
(She is the master of dad jokes.) 

664
00:25:28,404 --> 00:25:29,934
For goodness' sake, Sejeong. 

665
00:25:30,734 --> 00:25:32,204
You seemed like Park Yeonggyu for a second. 

666
00:25:32,834 --> 00:25:34,234
For goodness' sake. 

667
00:25:34,234 --> 00:25:35,604
You are a young lady. 

668
00:25:36,564 --> 00:25:38,234
I don't know why I am touched by a joke. 

669
00:25:39,104 --> 00:25:41,334
(It was a touching match.) 

670
00:25:41,434 --> 00:25:44,534
Solji, I heard that you laugh in a funny way 

671
00:25:44,534 --> 00:25:46,464
to get more screen time. 

672
00:25:46,564 --> 00:25:49,064
There can be many guests on the show. 

673
00:25:49,064 --> 00:25:51,234
- If there are many guests / - It happens. 

674
00:25:51,234 --> 00:25:53,804
on a variety show, I need to show reactions. 

675
00:25:53,904 --> 00:25:57,134
- It's a survival skill. / - I pondered on the matter. 

676
00:25:57,334 --> 00:25:59,434
If I react well, clap 

677
00:25:59,534 --> 00:26:02,304
and laugh with my cheekbones, 

678
00:26:02,404 --> 00:26:03,764
I will get more screen time. 

679
00:26:03,764 --> 00:26:05,504
How do you laugh with your cheekbones? 

680
00:26:05,504 --> 00:26:07,834
- Make her laugh. / - Go ahead, Saeho. 

681
00:26:07,934 --> 00:26:09,064
(Are you ready to make her laugh?) 

682
00:26:09,564 --> 00:26:11,164
- I will imitate Lee Daegeun. / - Okay. 

683
00:26:11,164 --> 00:26:12,434
(He will imitate Lee Daegeun.) 

684
00:26:12,634 --> 00:26:13,664
My goodness. 

685
00:26:13,804 --> 00:26:15,404
(She begins to laugh right away.) 

686
00:26:15,404 --> 00:26:16,404
What? 

687
00:26:16,834 --> 00:26:18,664
(She is laughing very hard.) 

688
00:26:18,664 --> 00:26:20,634
- Is it that funny? / - Seriously? 

689
00:26:20,864 --> 00:26:21,934
She is in tears. 

690
00:26:21,934 --> 00:26:24,034
This is the reaction you need to show. 

691
00:26:24,904 --> 00:26:26,564
- My goodness. / - That was scary. 

692
00:26:26,564 --> 00:26:27,604
How scary. 

693
00:26:28,334 --> 00:26:30,334
- I thought your laugh was genuine. / - Wasn't it? 

694
00:26:30,334 --> 00:26:32,564
I laugh a lot, but 

695
00:26:32,734 --> 00:26:34,004
I also purposefully give a bigger reaction. 

696
00:26:34,064 --> 00:26:36,334
- He wasn't that funny? / - No. 

697
00:26:36,604 --> 00:26:39,204
I thought your laugh was genuine. 

698
00:26:40,004 --> 00:26:42,234
- Imitate Wheesung. / - Wheesung? 

699
00:26:42,534 --> 00:26:44,804
- She will react, right? / - Her reaction... 

700
00:26:44,804 --> 00:26:46,064
Let's guess if it is genuine or not. 

701
00:26:46,964 --> 00:26:49,334
(He shows his special talent.) 

702
00:26:53,804 --> 00:26:54,834
It's totally fake. 

703
00:26:55,534 --> 00:26:56,604
Yes, it is. 

704
00:26:57,504 --> 00:26:58,934
This is humiliating. 

705
00:26:59,704 --> 00:27:01,334
(This is genuine laughter.) 

706
00:27:01,634 --> 00:27:02,634
That one was genuine. 

707
00:27:02,704 --> 00:27:04,564
I feel like I am being used. 

708
00:27:05,064 --> 00:27:06,134
- We apologize. / - My goodness. 

709
00:27:06,634 --> 00:27:08,504
Sunny, can you show us your fake reaction? 

710
00:27:09,204 --> 00:27:10,704
Show us, Sunny. 

711
00:27:10,704 --> 00:27:12,834
- Can you do it? / - Of course I can. 

712
00:27:13,134 --> 00:27:15,134
You should try to make her laugh. 

713
00:27:15,134 --> 00:27:16,164
(It's Hyunmoo's turn.) 

714
00:27:16,164 --> 00:27:17,604
Do a voice imitation. 

715
00:27:18,234 --> 00:27:19,364
(If only I could run through time) 

716
00:27:19,364 --> 00:27:21,734
(And become an adult) 

717
00:27:22,504 --> 00:27:24,804
(She pauses for a moment and begins to laugh.) 

718
00:27:27,604 --> 00:27:28,704
It's so fake. 

719
00:27:29,664 --> 00:27:30,964
For goodness' sake. 

720
00:27:31,764 --> 00:27:33,234
They are incredible. 

721
00:27:34,664 --> 00:27:38,434
- I heard Sunny has something to say to me. / - Really? 

722
00:27:38,434 --> 00:27:40,004
- What will she say? / - It will be a criticism. 

723
00:27:40,004 --> 00:27:42,404
- I heard that it is. / - Is she annoying? 

724
00:27:42,504 --> 00:27:43,564
Tell us. 

725
00:27:43,564 --> 00:27:47,304
I feel like Hyeongyeong tries to do everything alone. 

726
00:27:47,304 --> 00:27:49,634
- We should look after her. / - She should whine more. 

727
00:27:49,634 --> 00:27:50,704
That's what I wanted to tell her. 

728
00:27:50,704 --> 00:27:51,734
She should whine more. 

729
00:27:51,734 --> 00:27:55,234
I hope she will harmonize with the MCs. 

730
00:27:55,604 --> 00:27:57,664
- Sunny is objective. / - Try whining. 

731
00:27:58,104 --> 00:27:59,404
Help me out. 

732
00:28:02,864 --> 00:28:05,004
- Come on. / - It's hard to be nice to her. 

733
00:28:05,004 --> 00:28:06,764
- Come on. / - It's impossible. 

734
00:28:06,764 --> 00:28:09,564
- Help me out. / - She tires us out. 

735
00:28:10,064 --> 00:28:11,804
I feel tired all of a sudden. 

736
00:28:11,804 --> 00:28:13,004
Come on. 

737
00:28:13,004 --> 00:28:14,064
- What do you want? / - I feel tired. 

738
00:28:14,064 --> 00:28:16,504
Help me out. 

739
00:28:16,604 --> 00:28:17,704
What do you want? 

740
00:28:17,734 --> 00:28:19,934
- Make me popular. / - I don't know what she wants. 

741
00:28:20,234 --> 00:28:21,904
Give my face more screen time. 

742
00:28:23,404 --> 00:28:24,904
She said, "Give my face more screen time." 

743
00:28:25,834 --> 00:28:27,234
Give my face more screen time. 

744
00:28:27,434 --> 00:28:28,634
(It's a small gift from the production team.) 

745
00:28:29,204 --> 00:28:31,104
(Here are Hyeongyeong's faces.) 

746
00:28:31,304 --> 00:28:33,104
You should do this more often. 

747
00:28:33,464 --> 00:28:34,464
Whine more often. 

748
00:28:34,834 --> 00:28:36,864
- That was great. / - It was a good idea. 

749
00:28:37,304 --> 00:28:38,834
- It's a nice character. / - I should do this often. 

750
00:28:38,864 --> 00:28:40,904
- Is that what you wanted? / - I give her thumbs up. 

751
00:28:40,904 --> 00:28:42,164
- Thumbs up. / - It was great. 

752
00:28:42,164 --> 00:28:45,104
Let's talk about the exaggerated ways Sunny acts cute. 

753
00:28:45,104 --> 00:28:46,134
- The exaggerated ways. / - That's right. 

754
00:28:46,134 --> 00:28:49,634
Sunny usually winks. How else do you act cute? 

755
00:28:50,104 --> 00:28:53,234
I use hand gestures more. 

756
00:28:53,234 --> 00:28:55,334
Really? Which hand gestures do you use? 

757
00:28:58,834 --> 00:29:01,234
(She uses hand gestures which follow the lyrics.) 

758
00:29:02,064 --> 00:29:03,364
(Her hands tell the lyrics.) 

759
00:29:03,364 --> 00:29:04,664
Her gestures... 

760
00:29:05,064 --> 00:29:07,104
- Then I wink at the end. / - They follow the lyrics. 

761
00:29:07,204 --> 00:29:09,404
I think I am unrivalled in this field. 

762
00:29:10,004 --> 00:29:11,034
You are right. 

763
00:29:11,034 --> 00:29:12,504
- My hand gestures are great. / - You are right. 

764
00:29:12,504 --> 00:29:14,034
- I do this. / - The members of Girls' Generation said 

765
00:29:14,034 --> 00:29:15,964
that they don't know how 

766
00:29:15,964 --> 00:29:17,834
you manage to do so much in such little time. 

767
00:29:17,834 --> 00:29:20,364
- I don't even need to practice for this. / - Really? 

768
00:29:20,364 --> 00:29:22,734
It has to be improvised on the spot. 

769
00:29:22,734 --> 00:29:25,534
Our members are amazed by my skills. 

770
00:29:25,604 --> 00:29:27,934
Did you do it for "Lion Heart" as well? 

771
00:29:27,934 --> 00:29:29,904
(She begins to sing right away.) 

772
00:29:29,904 --> 00:29:33,364
♪ You're a free soul, you're still the same ♪ 

773
00:29:33,364 --> 00:29:35,234
♪ You stay true to your instincts ♪ 

774
00:29:35,234 --> 00:29:38,604
♪ Can't you see me in front of you? ♪ 

775
00:29:38,834 --> 00:29:39,834
(She always ends her part with a wink.) 

776
00:29:40,034 --> 00:29:41,804
She is incredible. 

777
00:29:41,804 --> 00:29:44,634
- That was scary. / - She blinked so fast. 

778
00:29:44,634 --> 00:29:46,934
- My goodness. / - That was incredible. 

779
00:29:46,934 --> 00:29:49,304
The time that is allotted to you as a member 

780
00:29:49,304 --> 00:29:52,064
gives you a chance to shine. 

781
00:29:52,064 --> 00:29:54,234
- It is important to do a good job. / - That's right. 

782
00:29:54,234 --> 00:29:56,034
I wanted to copy 

783
00:29:56,034 --> 00:29:58,164
Sunny's facial expressions. 

784
00:29:58,164 --> 00:30:00,734
I tried winking but my agency forbade it. 

785
00:30:00,834 --> 00:30:02,234
- Really? / - How did you wink? 

786
00:30:02,234 --> 00:30:04,404
- Actually, you can see, / - This is embarrassing. 

787
00:30:04,404 --> 00:30:06,364
Sunny wink in every performance. 

788
00:30:06,364 --> 00:30:08,764
- She winks a lot. / - I would like to see it. 

789
00:30:10,204 --> 00:30:12,604
- This is what I do. / - That's right. 

790
00:30:12,604 --> 00:30:15,034
While other members are singing, 

791
00:30:15,034 --> 00:30:16,064
- I do this at the back. / - That's right. 

792
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:17,334
(She winks behind the members.) 

793
00:30:17,334 --> 00:30:18,364
She does that. 

794
00:30:18,704 --> 00:30:21,104
That is cute. 

795
00:30:21,104 --> 00:30:23,734
- I do it even when it's not my part. / - That's right. 

796
00:30:23,734 --> 00:30:25,234
Cameramen get confused, 

797
00:30:25,234 --> 00:30:28,064
so they zoom in on me. 

798
00:30:28,064 --> 00:30:29,564
It's how I steal other members' parts. 

799
00:30:30,464 --> 00:30:31,634
She steals other members' parts. 

800
00:30:31,634 --> 00:30:33,264
Why did the agency forbid you from winking? 

801
00:30:33,264 --> 00:30:35,864
I was told that my face gets scrunched up when I wink. 

802
00:30:35,864 --> 00:30:37,064
Show us how it's like. 

803
00:30:37,064 --> 00:30:38,134
I am terrible at winking. 

804
00:30:38,134 --> 00:30:39,664
Please show us how you wink. 

805
00:30:40,134 --> 00:30:42,204
- My goodness. / - That wasn't a wink. 

806
00:30:42,464 --> 00:30:44,734
They asked me if I had something in my eyes. 

807
00:30:45,264 --> 00:30:46,564
(No wonder they forbade it.) 

808
00:30:46,564 --> 00:30:49,334
- She is terrible at winking. / - That's how 

809
00:30:49,334 --> 00:30:51,004
uncles winked when we were little. 

810
00:30:51,404 --> 00:30:52,764
That's what she did. 

811
00:30:52,764 --> 00:30:53,904
(Uncle's wink) 

812
00:30:54,764 --> 00:30:58,304
Winking is harder than you think. Sejeong. 

813
00:30:58,304 --> 00:30:59,464
I can do it well. 

814
00:30:59,464 --> 00:31:00,464
(It's a piece of cake.) 

815
00:31:01,204 --> 00:31:02,204
How cute! 

816
00:31:02,404 --> 00:31:04,034
- Sunny, let's see it. / - She can do it better. 

817
00:31:04,134 --> 00:31:05,934
(She gives a double wink.) 

818
00:31:05,934 --> 00:31:08,304
My goodness, she is incredible. 

819
00:31:08,304 --> 00:31:10,564
- She is amazing. / - Sunny's wink is better. 

820
00:31:10,564 --> 00:31:13,604
I am sure all of you practice the special techniques 

821
00:31:13,604 --> 00:31:15,934
to shine in your own parts. 

822
00:31:15,934 --> 00:31:17,264
The thing is, 

823
00:31:17,264 --> 00:31:20,604
I act like a middle-aged man most of the time. 

824
00:31:20,604 --> 00:31:22,104
It is very difficult to act cute. 

825
00:31:22,104 --> 00:31:25,564
Sejeong really acts like a middle-aged man. 

826
00:31:25,564 --> 00:31:27,004
She will need a lot of practice. 

827
00:31:27,004 --> 00:31:28,564
- It's incredibly hard for me. / - I see. 

828
00:31:28,564 --> 00:31:31,164
Not knowing how to act cute, I looked up videos. 

829
00:31:31,164 --> 00:31:34,104
Watching the videos made me go, "How cute!" 

830
00:31:34,564 --> 00:31:37,164
I realized why people like to see idols act cute. 

831
00:31:37,164 --> 00:31:38,804
That's why I began to practice. 

832
00:31:38,804 --> 00:31:40,434
At that time, Sunny, the master... 

833
00:31:40,434 --> 00:31:42,904
- The master? / - The master? 

834
00:31:42,904 --> 00:31:45,964
- She looks like a master in that dress. / - Right. 

835
00:31:45,964 --> 00:31:48,204
- Don't say that. / - She is a senior singer. 

836
00:31:48,204 --> 00:31:51,834
Mr. Kong, Sunny is here. 

837
00:31:52,404 --> 00:31:54,334
That kind of acting cute should be prohibited. 

838
00:31:54,534 --> 00:31:56,904
(It made him grab her by the collar.) 

839
00:31:57,204 --> 00:31:59,404
I am too much like a middle-aged man. 

840
00:31:59,404 --> 00:32:00,704
- Good luck. / - Give it a try. 

841
00:32:00,704 --> 00:32:03,204
- Don't worry and give it a go. / - We won't watch. 

842
00:32:03,304 --> 00:32:04,334
(Let's see how she does it.) 

843
00:32:05,634 --> 00:32:06,834
(She's nervous.) 

844
00:32:06,834 --> 00:32:08,934

That's what she can do. 

863
00:32:59,404 --> 00:33:02,634
The dance should be longer. Is that all you can do? 

864
00:33:02,634 --> 00:33:03,704
Yes. 

865

00:38:50,234 --> 00:38:51,634
- Please hide it. / - Okay. 

1018
00:38:51,804 --> 00:38:53,764
Sunny is ready to vote openly. 

1019
00:38:54,174 --> 00:38:55,304
(She is not shy.) 

1020
00:38:56,364 --> 00:38:58,204
In three, two, one. Press the button. 

1021
00:38:58,864 --> 00:38:59,904
- Let's see the result. / - Come on. 

1022
00:38:59,964 --> 00:39:01,104
I heard a click. 

1023
00:39:01,734 --> 00:39:03,434
The device does make a sound. 

1024
00:39:03,434 --> 00:39:05,464
- It does. / - How many people pressed the button? 

1025
00:39:05,464 --> 00:39:06,734
In three, two, one. Show us the result. 

1026
00:39:06,934 --> 00:39:09,034
(What will the result be?) 

1027
00:39:09,674 --> 00:39:11,404
(Have these shy girls) 

1028
00:39:11,404 --> 00:39:12,634
(been in a secret relationship?) 

1029
00:39:12,834 --> 00:39:13,834
Show us the result. 

1030
00:39:13,834 --> 00:39:16,674
(The result is revealed.) 

1031
00:39:18,734 --> 00:39:20,904
- Wow. / - No way. 

1032
00:39:21,204 --> 00:39:23,234
It's four out of six people. 

1033
00:39:23,264 --> 00:39:25,764
- It's four out of six people. / - Four out of six. 

1034
00:39:25,764 --> 00:39:27,204
- Is this confidential? / - The number is high. 

1035
00:39:27,204 --> 00:39:28,334
- Yes, it is. / - I'm so curious. 

1036
00:39:28,564 --> 00:39:29,704
Who could it be? 

1037
00:39:30,004 --> 00:39:31,764
- All right. / - She said, "Who could it be?" 

1038
00:39:31,764 --> 00:39:33,964
- Who could it be? Hold on. / - Is it you? 

1039
00:39:33,964 --> 00:39:36,104
I already have an idea. 

1040
00:39:36,234 --> 00:39:37,334
- Chahee? / - Yes? 

1041
00:39:38,334 --> 00:39:40,864
(Chahee is the first suspect.) 

1042
00:39:40,864 --> 00:39:42,174
- Chahee. / - You startled me. 

1043
00:39:42,234 --> 00:39:43,834
- I heard the click. / - I did, too. 

1044
00:39:43,834 --> 00:39:45,234
We catch on quickly. 

1045
00:39:45,234 --> 00:39:47,704
When were you in a secret relationship? 

1046
00:39:48,634 --> 00:39:50,464
We haven't revealed the results, yet. 

1047
00:39:50,464 --> 00:39:53,564
No, we didn't. It's just a hunch. 

1048
00:39:53,564 --> 00:39:55,464
You like to make things official, right? 

1049
00:39:55,464 --> 00:39:57,634
To tell you the truth, I have dated secretly. 

1050
00:39:57,634 --> 00:39:58,634
(She tells the truth.) 

1051
00:39:58,634 --> 00:40:00,864
- What did I tell you? / - You were right. 

1052
00:40:00,864 --> 00:40:02,034
I had a hunch. 

1053
00:40:02,034 --> 00:40:03,764
It was thrilling and fun. 

1054
00:40:04,264 --> 00:40:05,464
(She's unstoppable.) 

1055
00:40:05,464 --> 00:40:06,504
Hold on, Chahee. 

1056
00:40:07,104 --> 00:40:09,464
You're not making this up, are you? 

1057
00:40:09,734 --> 00:40:11,864
- You're not, right? / - I can't lie. 

1058
00:40:11,864 --> 00:40:14,264
Hold on. You said it was thrilling and fun 

1059
00:40:14,264 --> 00:40:16,264
- so was it somebody in the same field? / - It must be. 

1060
00:40:16,264 --> 00:40:18,034
I can't tell you more. 

1061
00:40:18,034 --> 00:40:19,264
You told us enough. 

1062
00:40:19,504 --> 00:40:21,764
- She said it was thrilling. / - Who was the guy? 

1063
00:40:21,834 --> 00:40:22,964
You guys should say it, too. 

1064
00:40:22,964 --> 00:40:24,934
(You need to come clean as well.) 

1065
00:40:24,934 --> 00:40:27,504
- You need to say it. / - We'll finish this topic now. 

1066
00:40:28,004 --> 00:40:29,364
(Only her secret relationship was revealed.) 

1067
00:40:29,364 --> 00:40:32,764
- We have a lot to cover, / - We have many themes. 

1068
00:40:33,304 --> 00:40:35,504
so we don't need to go through everybody. 

1069
00:40:35,934 --> 00:40:39,034
We've got one person, 

1070
00:40:39,034 --> 00:40:42,004
so we need to find three more. What about Solji? 

1071
00:40:42,404 --> 00:40:44,404
- Me? / - Yes. 

1072
00:40:44,404 --> 00:40:45,864
- You didn't press the button, right? / - Didn't you? 

1073
00:40:45,864 --> 00:40:47,964
- I didn't. / - Are you being honest? 

1074
00:40:48,064 --> 00:40:49,134
You pressed it. 

1075
00:40:51,504 --> 00:40:53,964
We're not told to date in secret. 

1076
00:40:53,964 --> 00:40:56,434
- I'm on the older side / - That's right. 

1077
00:40:57,034 --> 00:40:59,174
so they say that I'm an exception. 

1078
00:40:59,174 --> 00:41:00,964
- So you're not... / - You are allowed to date? 

1079
00:41:00,964 --> 00:41:03,764
You shouldn't hold it in. Why don't you just tell us? 

1080
00:41:03,764 --> 00:41:04,804
- Me? / - Yes. 

1081
00:41:05,034 --> 00:41:06,364
But I don't have a boyfriend. 

1082
00:41:06,364 --> 00:41:09,104
- We made our debut in 2006, / - Right. 

1083
00:41:09,364 --> 00:41:11,364
so I've never had a boyfriend since then. 

1084
00:41:11,364 --> 00:41:12,604
- Really? / - In public. 

1085
00:41:12,734 --> 00:41:14,004
"In public"? 

1086
00:41:14,604 --> 00:41:17,064
- It's only on the outside. / - What's she implying? 

1087
00:41:17,064 --> 00:41:19,864
- What does that mean? / - She said it herself. 

1088
00:41:19,864 --> 00:41:22,504
When Jaeseok was filming "Infinite Challenge", 

1089
00:41:22,504 --> 00:41:25,564
- he met his wife. / - Her nickname was Ma Bongchun. 

1090
00:41:25,564 --> 00:41:27,434
- That time... / - You dated her in secret, right? 

1091
00:41:27,864 --> 00:41:29,504
We didn't really date secretly. 

1092
00:41:29,504 --> 00:41:30,734
It's been ten years so... 

1093
00:41:30,734 --> 00:41:33,634
- You didn't intend it. / - It was fun, right? 

1094
00:41:33,634 --> 00:41:35,564
Didn't he tell the members of "Infinite Challenge"? 

1095
00:41:35,564 --> 00:41:36,634
I had no idea. 

1096
00:41:37,764 --> 00:41:39,564
There was a member who knew. 

1097
00:41:39,564 --> 00:41:41,264
- But it wasn't Myungsoo? / - No, it wasn't. 

1098
00:41:42,674 --> 00:41:44,004
I would've never told him. 

1099
00:41:44,764 --> 00:41:46,864
I never told him. 

1100
00:41:47,464 --> 00:41:49,564
- As soon as you tell him... / - It's good he didn't. 

1101
00:41:49,564 --> 00:41:51,234
- I'd rather / - I was relieved. 

1102
00:41:51,234 --> 00:41:56,174
make it official than tell him a secret. 

1103
00:41:56,234 --> 00:41:57,604
- He would even say it on Happy Together. / - No way. 

1104
00:41:58,004 --> 00:41:59,864
- I was relieved / - Right. 

1105
00:41:59,864 --> 00:42:03,234
that I didn't do anything wrong to his wife back then. 

1106
00:42:04,174 --> 00:42:07,634
A member or two did a few things wrong, 

1107
00:42:07,834 --> 00:42:10,564
but I didn't do anything wrong. Not even once. 

1108
00:42:10,564 --> 00:42:12,004
I could have been in trouble. 

1109
00:42:12,864 --> 00:42:15,464
- Seriously... Congratulations. / - Thank you. 

1110
00:42:15,764 --> 00:42:17,734
- Thank you for your compliment. / - Sure. 

1111
00:42:17,734 --> 00:42:20,504
There were some members of Girls' Generation 

1112
00:42:20,504 --> 00:42:23,464
who made their dating official. 

1113
00:42:23,464 --> 00:42:24,964
- Us? / - Yes. 

1114
00:42:25,364 --> 00:42:27,234
You pressed the button, right? 

1115
00:42:27,304 --> 00:42:28,334
- Did I? / - Yes. 

1116
00:42:28,334 --> 00:42:30,464
One of your buttons is still pressed. 

1117
00:42:30,734 --> 00:42:32,834
- It's still pressed. / - It's so obvious. 

1118
00:42:32,834 --> 00:42:34,404
- You pressed it too hard. / - Yes, Sunny. 

1119
00:42:34,404 --> 00:42:35,934
Why is it still pressed? 

1120
00:42:37,504 --> 00:42:39,404
(The third suspect is caught.) 

1121
00:42:40,134 --> 00:42:43,404
You already admitted it, so how do you keep it hidden? 

1122
00:42:43,564 --> 00:42:45,004
Bring people who don't arouse any suspicion 

1123
00:42:45,004 --> 00:42:46,264
when you're dating. 

1124
00:42:48,464 --> 00:42:50,134
Was that what it was? 

1125
00:42:50,134 --> 00:42:53,034
- Oh, dear. / - The people reporters don't care at all. 

1126
00:42:53,064 --> 00:42:56,264
From when are you allowed to go out with somebody? 

1127
00:42:56,264 --> 00:42:57,904
- Without hiding it from anybody? / - Yes. 

1128
00:42:58,404 --> 00:43:00,934
From the third year, 

1129
00:43:00,934 --> 00:43:02,064
- it gets lenient. / - It gets better. 

1130
00:43:02,064 --> 00:43:03,404
In the first year of debut, it's hardcore. 

1131
00:43:03,964 --> 00:43:05,064
"It's hardcore"? 

1132
00:43:05,634 --> 00:43:07,334
- You can't use that language on KBS. / - I'm sorry. 

1133
00:43:08,034 --> 00:43:09,734
During the first year, it's strict. 

1134
00:43:09,734 --> 00:43:11,064
It's strict? 

1135
00:43:11,064 --> 00:43:12,464
The first part will be aired on television. 

1136
00:43:14,464 --> 00:43:15,934
We can do that, right? 

1137
00:43:15,934 --> 00:43:18,964
In the beginning, the agency is strict 

1138
00:43:19,234 --> 00:43:21,464
and from the second year, they get lazy. 

1139
00:43:21,464 --> 00:43:23,504
From the third year, you can date. 

1140
00:43:23,504 --> 00:43:24,904
You can date from the third year. 

1141
00:43:25,234 --> 00:43:27,234
- I heard about this tip, too. / - What is it? 

1142
00:43:27,234 --> 00:43:30,164
When you get asked about your ideal type, 

1143
00:43:30,404 --> 00:43:32,564
you elaborate on it. 

1144
00:43:32,564 --> 00:43:33,764
That's true. 

1145
00:43:33,764 --> 00:43:35,964
When you're single, you talk about it generally. 

1146
00:43:35,964 --> 00:43:37,864
- You would be more general / - That's right. 

1147
00:43:37,864 --> 00:43:40,764
but at one point, you start describing their eyes. 

1148
00:43:40,764 --> 00:43:42,564
You picture the person while you say it. 

1149
00:43:42,564 --> 00:43:44,504
- You think about them while you say it. / - I agree. 

1150
00:43:44,664 --> 00:43:45,664
What do you say? 

1151
00:43:46,004 --> 00:43:49,504
Are there times when you could tell 

1152
00:43:49,504 --> 00:43:51,164
from the other members? 

1153
00:43:51,864 --> 00:43:54,234
Pardon? There's nothing like that. 

1154
00:43:54,234 --> 00:43:55,234
Say it! 

1155
00:43:56,834 --> 00:43:58,764
We're going to make you tell us before this show ends. 

1156
00:43:59,064 --> 00:44:00,504
We need at least one person to come clean. 

1157
00:44:00,504 --> 00:44:03,534
Let's make a deal. We won't try to find out who it is. 

1158
00:44:03,764 --> 00:44:06,134
- Just tell us how it's like. / - That's 

1159
00:44:06,134 --> 00:44:08,404
- the only way we can finish filming. / - That's right. 

1160
00:44:08,934 --> 00:44:12,534
We're all trying to make a living here. 

1161
00:44:13,104 --> 00:44:15,164
All three of you say that it's you. 

1162
00:44:16,064 --> 00:44:18,064
- You're four, five and six. / - That's Hyeongyeong. 

1163
00:44:18,064 --> 00:44:19,404
Sorry, Hyeongyeong. 

1164
00:44:19,834 --> 00:44:21,234
- That's Hyeongyeong. / - Should I say something? 

1165
00:44:21,234 --> 00:44:22,504
She's one of us. 

1166
00:44:22,504 --> 00:44:24,134
I was confused because of her hairstyle. 

1167
00:44:24,234 --> 00:44:25,964
- There's something going on, right? / - No. 

1168
00:44:25,964 --> 00:44:27,504
What's Yuju's ideal type of men? 

1169
00:44:27,764 --> 00:44:29,664
I don't know whom our members like. 

1170
00:44:29,664 --> 00:44:30,764
- What about your ideal type? / - What about yourself? 

1171
00:44:30,864 --> 00:44:33,264
- Me? I like... / - You like... 

1172
00:44:34,004 --> 00:44:35,764
- You like... / - She thought about somebody. 

1173
00:44:35,764 --> 00:44:38,164
- She did. / - I have a hunch. She thought about him. 

1174
00:44:38,364 --> 00:44:40,604
I like men who are passionate about their work 

1175
00:44:41,564 --> 00:44:44,234
- That's me. / - There he is. 

1176
00:44:44,404 --> 00:44:45,604
I work so hard. 

1177
00:44:45,864 --> 00:44:48,604
♪ Your eyes, nose and lips ♪ 

1178
00:44:48,664 --> 00:44:50,734
- I can do anything. / - If you pull down 

1179
00:44:50,734 --> 00:44:52,264
his zipper, he'll be pouring two liters of sweat. 

1180
00:44:52,864 --> 00:44:54,104
He's so sweaty. 

1181
00:44:54,104 --> 00:44:55,834
- It's his sweat. / - I zipped it up. 

1182
00:44:55,834 --> 00:44:58,164
- It's like meat broth. / - Be careful. 

1183
00:44:58,164 --> 00:45:00,434
I love filming with Hodong. 

1184
00:45:01,264 --> 00:45:04,034
- He's like him. / - I love having Hodong around. 

1185
00:45:04,464 --> 00:45:05,964
He's so much fun. 

1186
00:45:05,964 --> 00:45:07,164
He's so reliable. 

1187
00:45:07,664 --> 00:45:10,364
What's your ideal type, Sejeong? 

1188
00:45:10,564 --> 00:45:14,834
For me, I think like an old person. 

1189
00:45:15,034 --> 00:45:16,734
- You're a mature young adult? / - That's right. 

1190
00:45:16,734 --> 00:45:18,734
That's how I am 

1191
00:45:18,734 --> 00:45:21,704
so I'm not attracted to men who are immature. 

1192
00:45:22,404 --> 00:45:23,864
- You like older men, then. / - Right, so 

1193
00:45:23,864 --> 00:45:26,464
I like mature men 

1194
00:45:26,464 --> 00:45:28,834
who are witty. I like funny guys. 

1195
00:45:28,834 --> 00:45:30,734
How old is the oldest guy you'd date? 

1196
00:45:30,734 --> 00:45:32,504
I actually thought about it. 

1197
00:45:33,264 --> 00:45:34,834
You're 21, right? 

1198
00:45:34,834 --> 00:45:36,264
He can be 12 years older at most. 

1199
00:45:36,264 --> 00:45:37,864
He'll be the same zodiac sign as you. 

1200
00:45:37,864 --> 00:45:41,134
All men who heard this must be going, 

1201
00:45:41,134 --> 00:45:42,204
"Yes"! 

1202
00:45:42,204 --> 00:45:43,504
(Sejeong says it's okay.) 

1203
00:45:43,664 --> 00:45:47,464
- Yes! / - I think what Sejeong said 

1204
00:45:47,564 --> 00:45:50,034
was very specific. 

1205
00:45:50,404 --> 00:45:52,064
You like mature men who are 12 years older 

1206
00:45:52,064 --> 00:45:53,734
than you and witty. 

1207
00:45:53,734 --> 00:45:56,264
- Would he be 33? / - No, I'm actually 

1208
00:45:56,464 --> 00:46:00,304
attracted to actors who are older than me. 

1209
00:46:00,364 --> 00:46:02,134
- I think they're so handsome. / - Can you name them? 

1210
00:46:02,134 --> 00:46:03,764
- Ma Dongseok? / - I see. 

1211
00:46:03,764 --> 00:46:05,204
- He's known for his cuteness. / - She does like him. 

1212
00:46:05,204 --> 00:46:07,934
I asked myself if I could date a man like him 

1213
00:46:08,064 --> 00:46:10,104
- and I think I can. / - Is he your ideal type? 

1214
00:46:10,104 --> 00:46:13,104
- I like men who are warm-hearted. / - That's Saeho. 

1215
00:46:13,234 --> 00:46:15,364
Doesn't he fall in the category? 

1216
00:46:15,364 --> 00:46:17,364
- She just laughed. / - What was that for? 

1217
00:46:17,734 --> 00:46:19,734
- What was that for? / - Don't his looks qualify? 

1218
00:46:19,864 --> 00:46:21,104
- Just his looks. / - They're similar. 

1219
00:46:21,104 --> 00:46:23,404
- He looks warm... / - He's cute, too. 

1220
00:46:23,404 --> 00:46:25,064
- He's also funny. / - Where's this going? 

1221
00:46:25,064 --> 00:46:26,304
He's like Baek Jongwon of the comedy industry. 

1222
00:46:26,304 --> 00:46:27,334
What did you say? 

1223
00:46:27,334 --> 00:46:29,564
- I don't like men who resemble carbonara. / - What? 

1224
00:46:29,564 --> 00:46:31,734
- She doesn't like men who look cheesy. / - I don't. 

1225
00:46:31,734 --> 00:46:32,934
- Do I look cheesy? / - Is he? 

1226
00:46:32,934 --> 00:46:34,934
There's something more to it. 

1227
00:46:34,934 --> 00:46:36,434
She just doesn't like you. 

1228
00:46:37,034 --> 00:46:40,804
I have my opinion as well. I just wanted to know. 

1229
00:46:40,864 --> 00:46:44,134
Pick among Ma Dongseok, Lee Seojin and me. 

1230
00:46:44,464 --> 00:46:46,234
This is difficult. 

1231
00:46:46,234 --> 00:46:48,134
All right. One, two, three. 

1232
00:46:48,834 --> 00:46:50,504
- Oh, gosh. / - Let's say we're the same age. 

1233
00:46:50,504 --> 00:46:52,734
- I pick... / - We'll say they're the same age. 

1234
00:46:52,734 --> 00:46:54,464
- Let's say they're 12 years older. / - They're all 33. 

1235
00:46:54,464 --> 00:46:56,564
Then, I pick Lee Seojin. 

1236
00:46:56,564 --> 00:46:58,034
(She picks Lee Seojin.) 

1237
00:46:58,634 --> 00:47:00,764
You care so much about the looks. 

1238
00:47:00,764 --> 00:47:02,934
- You care about the looks. / - I didn't finish. 

1239
00:47:02,934 --> 00:47:05,264
- I had my hopes up. / - Seojin... 

1240
00:47:05,734 --> 00:47:08,334
Seojin isn't that funny or witty. 

1241
00:47:08,734 --> 00:47:10,564
I thought she'd pick Ma Dongseok. 

1242
00:47:10,564 --> 00:47:12,864
Although Ma Dongseok did nothing, 

1243
00:47:13,064 --> 00:47:14,664
he's probably getting so many text messages now. 

1244
00:47:14,664 --> 00:47:16,234
- It's like he's the loser. / - He could seem that way. 

1245
00:47:16,304 --> 00:47:18,834
People around him would say, "It's okay, Dongseok." 

1246
00:47:20,104 --> 00:47:22,104
Let's move to the next question. 

1247
00:47:22,364 --> 00:47:25,934
"I have been jealous of a member" 

1248
00:47:25,934 --> 00:47:27,564
"who was more popular than me." 

1249
00:47:28,264 --> 00:47:29,264
From their own members? 

1250
00:47:29,264 --> 00:47:32,264
You might have felt this way momentarily. 

1251
00:47:32,264 --> 00:47:35,564
- It doesn't have to last. / - We're all humans. 

1252
00:47:35,564 --> 00:47:37,464
Have you ever been jealous of someone, Jaeseok? 

1253
00:47:37,934 --> 00:47:39,434
Have you ever been jealous of Myungsoo? 

1254
00:47:39,464 --> 00:47:40,734
I haven't. 

1255
00:47:41,634 --> 00:47:43,564
(He didn't even hesitate for a second.) 

1256
00:47:43,564 --> 00:47:45,764
You're so mean. 

1257
00:47:45,764 --> 00:47:48,564
- You're so mean. / - I've never been jealous of you. 

1258
00:47:48,564 --> 00:47:50,864
- You could've said it in a nice way. / - I'm serious. 

1259
00:47:50,864 --> 00:47:53,264
I don't think he's been jealous of me either. 

1260
00:47:53,264 --> 00:47:55,104
- Why not? / - You have? 

1261
00:47:55,104 --> 00:47:56,664
He's still jealous of you. 

1262
00:47:56,664 --> 00:47:58,634
I always hope that you don't do better. 

1263
00:47:59,264 --> 00:48:00,734
You can't be better than now. 

1264
00:48:01,364 --> 00:48:03,004
Only then, would I take your position. 

1265
00:48:03,004 --> 00:48:05,664
I'll try my best to be jealous of Myungsoo. 

1266
00:48:05,664 --> 00:48:07,164
Just try a little bit and you'll feel like me. 

1267
00:48:07,164 --> 00:48:09,564
- Try your best. / - I'll try to be jealous. 

1268
00:48:09,864 --> 00:48:12,934
If you're decided, please press the button. 

1269
00:48:12,934 --> 00:48:14,864
One, two, three. 

1270
00:48:15,604 --> 00:48:17,664
Press the button if you're applied. Press it firmly. 

1271
00:48:17,664 --> 00:48:18,734
(It's time to decide.) 

1272
00:48:18,734 --> 00:48:20,764
Let's see the result. One, two, three. 

1273
00:48:21,364 --> 00:48:22,364
Let's see! 

1274
00:48:22,864 --> 00:48:24,034
- You see? / - It's two people. 

1275
00:48:24,034 --> 00:48:25,504
It's Solji and... 

1276
00:48:25,504 --> 00:48:27,664
We're the ones with bad minds. 

1277
00:48:27,664 --> 00:48:30,404
We reminded each other when we made the debut 

1278
00:48:30,404 --> 00:48:32,904
that popularity comes and goes like seasons do, 

1279
00:48:33,464 --> 00:48:37,364
so even if you're more popular, let's not be conceited. 

1280
00:48:37,404 --> 00:48:40,334
Our team's career is more important 

1281
00:48:40,334 --> 00:48:42,134
than individual popularity. 

1282
00:48:42,204 --> 00:48:43,564
- That's so mature. / - And 

1283
00:48:43,564 --> 00:48:45,704
when each of us gets popular, 

1284
00:48:45,704 --> 00:48:47,834
our group would be successful. 

1285
00:48:47,834 --> 00:48:49,634
That's what we always talked about. 

1286
00:48:50,264 --> 00:48:53,364
I know somebody who's always popular. 

1287
00:48:54,204 --> 00:48:55,204
- It doesn't come and go. / - The person next to you? 

1288
00:48:55,204 --> 00:48:56,264
- Who is it? / - Him. 

1289
00:48:58,264 --> 00:48:59,264
You must be happy. 

1290
00:49:00,064 --> 00:49:01,134
He's jealous right now. 

1291
00:49:01,664 --> 00:49:03,634
Well I can't deny it. 

1292
00:49:06,504 --> 00:49:08,804
- It's like spring for him every day. / - I'm happy. 

1293
00:49:09,104 --> 00:49:11,264
- I'm happy about it. / - That's right. I have to 

1294
00:49:11,264 --> 00:49:14,034
- learn from you. / - How could I not be happy? 

1295
00:49:14,034 --> 00:49:16,064
- I'm grateful. / - That coffee must be bitter. 

1296
00:49:16,364 --> 00:49:18,364
It must be black coffee. 

1297
00:49:18,804 --> 00:49:22,104
Can you imitate any of your members, Sunny? 

1298
00:49:22,104 --> 00:49:24,434
- From Girls' Generation, I mean. / - From my team? 

1299
00:49:24,434 --> 00:49:26,734
You must know their special characteristics. 

1300
00:49:26,934 --> 00:49:28,634
Tiffany smiles with her eyes. 

1301
00:49:29,934 --> 00:49:31,364
Turn your head. Do it again. 

1302
00:49:31,564 --> 00:49:33,464
(They're like identical twins.) 

1303
00:49:33,464 --> 00:49:35,864
- Good one. / - You look exactly like her. 

1304
00:49:35,964 --> 00:49:36,964
That's all I can do. 

1305
00:49:37,704 --> 00:49:39,564
- That was Tiffany's smile. / - They look alike. 

1306
00:49:39,564 --> 00:49:41,334
- Hello, Tiffany. / - Hello. 

1307
00:49:41,334 --> 00:49:42,504
(She summons Tiffany.) 

1308
00:49:43,164 --> 00:49:44,234
(Tiffany was just here.) 

1309
00:49:44,234 --> 00:49:45,404
- Oh, dear. / - I can see it. 

1310
00:49:45,534 --> 00:49:48,404
What about you, Sejeong? 

1311
00:49:48,564 --> 00:49:49,904
Let's flip the question. 

1312
00:49:50,764 --> 00:49:52,864
You had the attention from the beginning. 

1313
00:49:52,864 --> 00:49:54,304
- Others could have been jealous. / - What do you say? 

1314
00:49:54,304 --> 00:49:57,804
No, I don't think so. I thought many would press it. 

1315
00:49:57,804 --> 00:49:59,834
- I'm one of the two people. / - I see. 

1316
00:49:59,934 --> 00:50:03,804
Each of our members is popular in different aspects. 

1317
00:50:03,964 --> 00:50:06,034
I keep on acting like old men. 

1318
00:50:06,234 --> 00:50:09,204
But I also want people to say that I'm adorable, 

1319
00:50:09,204 --> 00:50:11,864
but Mina is more adorable. 

1320
00:50:11,864 --> 00:50:14,364
- That's right. / - And she's not trying to act cute. 

1321
00:50:14,364 --> 00:50:18,034
She's just cute when she dances. 

1322
00:50:18,134 --> 00:50:20,704
I wanted to be cute like her somehow, 

1323
00:50:20,704 --> 00:50:22,564
but I wasn't jealous of her. 

1324
00:50:22,664 --> 00:50:25,434
It was more like, "I envy you, dude." 

1325
00:50:25,734 --> 00:50:26,834
She called her dude. 

1326
00:50:26,834 --> 00:50:28,664
She said it like an old man. 

1327
00:50:28,904 --> 00:50:30,634
- That's me talking to my friend. / - She's very cute. 

1328
00:50:30,634 --> 00:50:34,534
Your tone of voice doesn't suit a girl group member. 

1329
00:50:34,534 --> 00:50:36,164
- She sounds old and friendly. / - She does. 

1330
00:50:36,264 --> 00:50:38,064
She doesn't even pronounce things properly. 

1331
00:50:38,534 --> 00:50:39,564
I agree. 

1332
00:50:40,204 --> 00:50:41,434
What about you, Solbin? 

1333
00:50:41,434 --> 00:50:44,304
I'm also one of the active members in our group 

1334
00:50:44,304 --> 00:50:47,264
who often appears on TV. 

1335
00:50:47,264 --> 00:50:51,504
I was an MC on "Music Bank" and I had photo shoots, 

1336
00:50:51,734 --> 00:50:54,134
but the members think the same way. 

1337
00:50:54,234 --> 00:50:56,504
They're rooting for me. 

1338
00:50:56,504 --> 00:50:59,434
I was nervous about coming today. 

1339
00:50:59,434 --> 00:51:02,664
I even prepared 11 impersonations. 

1340
00:51:03,334 --> 00:51:05,264
(She has 11 impersonations to show us.) 

1341
00:51:05,264 --> 00:51:08,864
- We almost skipped you. / - I tried it with them. 

1342
00:51:08,864 --> 00:51:11,604
They told me what to do and what not to do. 

1343
00:51:11,764 --> 00:51:14,604
They told me to be confident. 

1344
00:51:14,604 --> 00:51:18,464
Wait. She prepared 11 impersonations for today. 

1345
00:51:18,464 --> 00:51:20,634
- You tried it in front of the members, right? / - Yes. 

1346
00:51:21,904 --> 00:51:24,904
- You can do it. / - We have to see it. 

1347
00:51:24,904 --> 00:51:27,134
It would last about ten minutes. 

1348
00:51:27,404 --> 00:51:28,764
(That's a lot of time in front of the camera.) 

1349
00:51:28,764 --> 00:51:31,464
I'll start with a dolphin. 

1350
00:51:31,464 --> 00:51:33,234
- A dolphin? / - All right. 

1351
00:51:35,034 --> 00:51:36,564
(She'll mimic a dolphin sound.) 

1352
00:51:36,764 --> 00:51:38,704
(She tries her best.) 

1353
00:51:39,904 --> 00:51:41,904
(Hello, dolphins.) 

1354
00:51:42,334 --> 00:51:43,864
That sounds like a dolphin. 

1355
00:51:44,404 --> 00:51:46,504
I almost responded with a squeal. 

1356
00:51:46,904 --> 00:51:48,334
(They all give it a try.) 

1357
00:51:48,334 --> 00:51:50,364
- I can also do a siren. / - A siren? 

1358
00:51:50,434 --> 00:51:53,964
(She mimics a siren sound.) 

1359
00:51:53,964 --> 00:51:54,964
Isn't that a dolphin? 

1360
00:51:57,334 --> 00:51:58,964
Okay, so that's number two. 

1361
00:51:59,234 --> 00:52:01,604
- It sounds like that. / - That's two. What's next? 

1362
00:52:01,664 --> 00:52:04,464
- I can also do a boiling water sound. / - Okay. 

1363
00:52:04,464 --> 00:52:06,904
- They're along the same pitch. / - They're common. 

1364
00:52:06,904 --> 00:52:07,964
(Is she going for a high-pitched sound again?) 

1365
00:52:11,464 --> 00:52:13,534
That's a dolphin. 

1366
00:52:13,534 --> 00:52:15,234
- All right. / - There's more. 

1367
00:52:15,234 --> 00:52:18,364
Aren't you just going between head and chest voice? 

1368
00:52:18,864 --> 00:52:21,304
(They're all high-pitched sounds.) 

1369
00:52:22,564 --> 00:52:23,604
What's next? 

1370
00:52:23,604 --> 00:52:27,864
I've also prepared an impersonation of Lena Park 

1371
00:52:27,864 --> 00:52:29,964
- at the last minute. / - At the last minute. 

1372
00:52:33,664 --> 00:52:35,334
(She's absorbed in herself.) 

1373
00:52:35,534 --> 00:52:38,264
(I know it's a dream) 

1374
00:52:39,104 --> 00:52:41,504
(But I don't want) 

1375
00:52:42,164 --> 00:52:43,534
- That was funny. / - Did you lose your teeth? 

1376
00:52:43,534 --> 00:52:45,304
That was funny. Good job. 

1377
00:52:45,304 --> 00:52:46,704
- That was good. / - What's next? 

1378
00:52:46,704 --> 00:52:49,034
I can imitate a fish's face. 

1379
00:52:49,034 --> 00:52:50,064
A fish's face? 

1380
00:52:50,064 --> 00:52:52,204
I can do a salmon, skate and sole, 

1381
00:52:52,234 --> 00:52:53,604
but they told me not to do it. 

1382
00:52:53,604 --> 00:52:55,064
- Let's see a salmon. / - I'll try it. 

1383
00:52:55,064 --> 00:52:56,564
It's a salmon, a skate and a sole. 

1384
00:52:57,734 --> 00:53:00,564
Salmon. Skate! Sole. 

1385
00:53:01,734 --> 00:53:02,764
- That's cute. / - Let's see that again. 

1386
00:53:03,504 --> 00:53:06,064
Salmon. Skate! Sole. 

1387
00:53:06,064 --> 00:53:07,204
Let's see the sole first. 

1388
00:53:07,904 --> 00:53:10,334
Sole. Skate! Salmon. 

1389
00:53:11,264 --> 00:53:13,064
- That's cute. / - It's a good one. 

1390
00:53:13,304 --> 00:53:14,934
- We like stuff like this. / - She likes it. 

1391
00:53:14,964 --> 00:53:15,964
It's as good as 

1392
00:53:16,004 --> 00:53:17,804
"Chicken, pizza and sweet and sour pork". 

1393
00:53:17,834 --> 00:53:19,104
- It's good. / - I'm relieved. 

1394
00:53:19,134 --> 00:53:20,604
- My hands are sweaty. / - It's good. 

1395
00:53:20,634 --> 00:53:23,004
- You can also imitate a coffee sound? / - Right. 

1396
00:53:23,464 --> 00:53:26,734
I'll do americano, cappuccino, espresso and macchiato. 

1397
00:53:26,734 --> 00:53:28,004
- I'll do it in that order. / - That sounds good. 

1398
00:53:28,704 --> 00:53:29,934
Americano! 

1399
00:53:29,934 --> 00:53:31,264
Cappu... Cappuccino. 

1400
00:53:31,264 --> 00:53:32,334
Espresso! 

1401
00:53:32,334 --> 00:53:33,404
Macchiato. 

1402
00:53:34,504 --> 00:53:35,834
- Let's see that again. / - Macchiato. 

1403
00:53:35,834 --> 00:53:37,064
Americano! 

1404
00:53:37,264 --> 00:53:38,604
Cappu... Cappuccino. 

1405
00:53:38,604 --> 00:53:39,604
Espresso! 

1406
00:53:39,704 --> 00:53:40,764
Macchiato. 

1407
00:53:40,764 --> 00:53:42,434
Let's go with the salmon. 

1408
00:53:42,764 --> 00:53:45,364
Salmon. Skate! Sole. 

1409
00:53:46,304 --> 00:53:48,164
- You said the member approved it, right? / - Yes. 

1410
00:53:48,364 --> 00:53:50,204
They were teaming up on you. 

1411
00:53:51,464 --> 00:53:53,534
- They were jealous of her. / - That's right. 

1412
00:53:53,534 --> 00:53:55,104
- I'm certain. / - It's funny, though. 

1413
00:53:55,104 --> 00:53:58,034
They're jealous of her for hosting "Music Bank". 

1414
00:53:58,204 --> 00:54:01,704
- She did 11 impersonations, / - My hands are sweaty. 

1415
00:54:02,104 --> 00:54:04,904
but Sejeong has something to show us as well. 

1416
00:54:05,164 --> 00:54:09,064
I had to film myself every weekend at my agency. 

1417
00:54:09,164 --> 00:54:11,134
You had to film one impersonation. 

1418
00:54:11,204 --> 00:54:13,264
- Same with us. / - You do it too, right? 

1419
00:54:13,264 --> 00:54:14,804
- You have to do it weekly. / - There's such thing? 

1420
00:54:14,804 --> 00:54:17,304
You run out of idea as time goes by. 

1421
00:54:17,304 --> 00:54:20,334
I ran out of topics so I took the safe bet... 

1422
00:54:20,334 --> 00:54:21,564
I mean, I took the safe route. 

1423
00:54:22,204 --> 00:54:23,534
(She fails to sound girlish.) 

1424
00:54:23,534 --> 00:54:24,604
Did she say "safe bet"? 

1425
00:54:25,304 --> 00:54:26,334
(Sejeong sounds like an old person.) 

1426
00:54:26,334 --> 00:54:28,164
It's coming out. 

1427
00:54:28,164 --> 00:54:30,664
- I can hear your Gimje dialect. / - Gimje... 

1428
00:54:30,834 --> 00:54:32,734
You sound very comfortable. Good one. 

1429
00:54:32,734 --> 00:54:35,704
I mean, I took the safe route and did what I'm good at. 

1430
00:54:35,704 --> 00:54:38,834
- I can copy the karaoke machine. / - Let's see. 

1431
00:54:38,834 --> 00:54:40,134
The karaoke machine goes 

1432
00:54:40,464 --> 00:54:43,204
"Wow, you're amazing! Go for a perfect score!" 

1433
00:54:44,664 --> 00:54:46,064
(This is Happy Together karaoke.) 

1434
00:54:47,304 --> 00:54:49,504
- You sound the same. / Can you do a sick chicken? 

1435
00:54:49,504 --> 00:54:52,764
Nayoung can actually do this, but I had 

1436
00:54:53,004 --> 00:54:56,204
nothing else to do so I asked her if I could do it. 

1437
00:54:56,204 --> 00:54:58,334
She told me to change it a bit and then do it. 

1438
00:54:58,434 --> 00:55:01,404
I wasn't even close to her, so I saved it for later... 

1439
00:55:01,404 --> 00:55:03,864
- That was her accent. / - What did you say? 

1440
00:55:04,334 --> 00:55:07,034
(Don't be surprised if you see her in Cheonan.) 

1441
00:55:07,804 --> 00:55:09,434
Excuse me, but did your grandma raise you? 

1442
00:55:10,104 --> 00:55:11,704
- How did you know? / - You sound like Yu Haejin. 

1443
00:55:11,704 --> 00:55:15,004
- Am I right? Your grandma must've... / - That's right. 

1444
00:55:15,004 --> 00:55:16,934
- Let's hear it. / - I don't sound like it at all. 

1445
00:55:16,934 --> 00:55:18,004
Let's hear it. 

1446
00:55:23,764 --> 00:55:24,834
(Let's leave this one to Nayoung.) 

1447
00:55:24,834 --> 00:55:25,864
I guess Nayoung is good at this. 

1448
00:55:25,904 --> 00:55:28,334
Chahee, you can do something too, right? 

1449
00:55:28,334 --> 00:55:30,304
- It's Chahee's turn. / - This is your chance. 

1450
00:55:30,304 --> 00:55:33,504
We never give anybody these many chances. 

1451
00:55:33,504 --> 00:55:34,564
- Is that right? / - Yes. 

1452
00:55:34,564 --> 00:55:36,104
I'll try impersonating Lee Jungjae. 

1453
00:55:36,104 --> 00:55:37,264
- Lee Jungjae? / - It's Lee Jungjae. 

1454
00:55:37,264 --> 00:55:38,704
- You're doing Lee Jungjae? / - Yes. 

1455
00:55:39,204 --> 00:55:41,334
Don't get me stuff like this. 

1456
00:55:41,864 --> 00:55:43,504
You sound like Zhu Bajie. 

1457
00:55:44,064 --> 00:55:45,364
(That's you.) 

1458
00:55:46,004 --> 00:55:47,964
- Do you have another line? / - Yes, I have one more. 

1459
00:55:47,964 --> 00:55:49,004
- What is it? / - Let's hear it. 

1460
00:55:49,234 --> 00:55:51,104
Are we the only three who know this plan? 

1461
00:55:51,934 --> 00:55:53,564
(This is it.) 

1462
00:55:53,564 --> 00:55:55,704
"Are we the only three who know this plan?" 

1463
00:55:56,504 --> 00:55:58,134
(She has a thick voice.) 

1464
00:55:59,034 --> 00:56:00,234
Imitate Yu Haejin. 

1465
00:56:00,304 --> 00:56:01,504
(It's Yu Haejin from "The Pirates".) 

1466
00:56:01,504 --> 00:56:04,764
Wait a minute! Was it the right or the left? 

1467
00:56:05,134 --> 00:56:07,664
- Isn't that Doraemon? / - That's true. 

1468
00:56:09,564 --> 00:56:11,004
(Is this it?) 

1469
00:56:11,334 --> 00:56:12,804
Nobita! 

1470
00:56:13,934 --> 00:56:14,964
(They approve.) 

1471
00:56:14,964 --> 00:56:17,864
Solbin takes over. 

1472
00:56:17,864 --> 00:56:19,304
(She steals the thunder.) 

1473
00:56:20,134 --> 00:56:21,164
(Chahee fails again.) 

1474
00:56:21,164 --> 00:56:23,434
She's much better at things she wasn't told to do. 

1475
00:56:23,434 --> 00:56:25,404
- My team told me not to do this. / - See? 

1476
00:56:25,404 --> 00:56:27,404
- They're jealous. / - They told me not to do this. 

1477
00:56:27,464 --> 00:56:29,334
- They told you not to do it? / - Let's go, Solji! 

1478
00:56:29,604 --> 00:56:31,364
- What do you have for us, Solji? / - Me? 

1479
00:56:31,434 --> 00:56:33,864
- Can you copy Im Wonhee's face? / - Should I do it? 

1480
00:56:33,864 --> 00:56:34,904
(Im Wonhee? Sure!) 

1481
00:56:35,334 --> 00:56:36,334
Let's see you impersonate Im Wonhee. 

1482
00:56:36,334 --> 00:56:37,464
(She was putting it off this whole time,) 

1483
00:56:38,804 --> 00:56:39,964
(and now the room is heating up.) 

1484
00:56:41,504 --> 00:56:44,064
I don't think we need to introduce ourselves. 

1485
00:56:44,464 --> 00:56:45,634
(She sounds like a cool guy.) 

1486
00:56:46,604 --> 00:56:47,904
(They must be siblings.) 

1487
00:56:47,904 --> 00:56:50,034
- You got it. / - You sounded like him. 

1488
00:56:50,034 --> 00:56:52,434
- You do sound like him. / - It's funny. 

1489
00:56:52,434 --> 00:56:54,734
I've got that under my belt. I'll do Hyun Sook next. 

1490
00:56:54,734 --> 00:56:55,804
(It's Singer Hyun Sook.) 

1491
00:56:55,904 --> 00:56:57,134
(She looks like her, too.) 

1492
00:56:57,134 --> 00:57:03,004
♪ Let's dance the hula dance with the tambourine ♪ 

1493
00:57:03,234 --> 00:57:04,964
Hello, it's Hyun Sook! 

1494
00:57:06,104 --> 00:57:08,664
(Solji is unstoppable.) 

1495
00:57:08,664 --> 00:57:10,304
- I approve. / - What about Pikachu? 

1496
00:57:10,504 --> 00:57:13,164
(She resembles Pikachu as well.) 

1497
00:57:13,164 --> 00:57:15,464
(Pikachu) 

1498
00:57:16,864 --> 00:57:19,004
- What about Im Wonhee? / - Do him again. 

1499
00:57:19,104 --> 00:57:21,834
I don't think we need to introduce ourselves. 

1500
00:57:22,034 --> 00:57:23,104
(She's a great entertainer.) 

1501
00:57:24,204 --> 00:57:26,804
(Thanks to her look-alike, she becomes the funniest.) 

1502
00:57:27,864 --> 00:57:30,064
Good job, Solji. 

1503
00:57:30,164 --> 00:57:31,164
(Is she determined?) 

1504
00:57:33,064 --> 00:57:34,064
I'll try Yeo Jingoo. 

1505
00:57:34,064 --> 00:57:35,434
- Yeo Jingoo? / - Good choice! 

1506
00:57:35,964 --> 00:57:37,204
- She'll do Yeo Jingoo. / - This is your chance. 

1507
00:57:37,204 --> 00:57:40,004
Our members do this, but I have to do it. 

1508
00:57:40,004 --> 00:57:41,764
- This is your sixth chance. / - All right. 

1509
00:57:41,764 --> 00:57:44,464
- I'm so scared. / - Please focus. Cue! 

1510
00:57:44,464 --> 00:57:46,234
(This is Yeo Jingoo from "Hwayi: A Monster Boy".) 

1511
00:57:46,234 --> 00:57:48,504
Father, I can see monsters. 

1512
00:57:48,904 --> 00:57:50,064
(She checks their responses.) 

1513
00:57:50,604 --> 00:57:52,064
- She can see monsters? / - I'm sorry. 

1514
00:57:52,064 --> 00:57:53,934
No, it's okay. You sound like Kim Raewon. 

1515
00:57:53,934 --> 00:57:55,304
You should have done his line from "Sunflower". 

1516
00:57:55,304 --> 00:57:58,034
Try "Did you have to take everything?" as Yeo Jingoo. 

1517
00:57:58,704 --> 00:57:59,864
Did you have to do it? 

1518
00:58:00,504 --> 00:58:01,734
You have to stick your chin out. 

1519
00:58:03,234 --> 00:58:04,264
All right. We're good to go. 

1520
00:58:04,634 --> 00:58:05,634
Did you... 

1521
00:58:05,664 --> 00:58:06,664
(She checks his reaction.) 

1522
00:58:06,704 --> 00:58:08,564
Did you have to take everything? 

1523
00:58:08,804 --> 00:58:09,864
That was close. 

1524
00:58:09,964 --> 00:58:12,734
For this, you have to open up your mouth and nostrils. 

1525
00:58:12,734 --> 00:58:13,734
Try it. 

1526
00:58:14,264 --> 00:58:15,264
(She summons him.) 

1527
00:58:15,434 --> 00:58:19,034
Did... Did you have to take everything? 

1528
00:58:19,904 --> 00:58:21,264
It's a nasal voice. 

1529
00:58:21,864 --> 00:58:23,834
(She imitates him perfectly.) 

1530
00:58:24,034 --> 00:58:26,564
Chahee gets her spotlight stolen again. 

1531
00:58:26,664 --> 00:58:28,364
- I think I should go. / - No, no. 

1532
00:58:29,034 --> 00:58:32,234
When Chahee starts, all of you go for her. 

1533
00:58:32,234 --> 00:58:34,864
It's like she got pushed over. 

1534
00:58:34,864 --> 00:58:37,034
- That's right. / - Your manager walked out crying. 

1535
00:58:37,034 --> 00:58:39,704
- He did. / - Your manager walked out. 

1536
00:58:40,204 --> 00:58:42,834
Hyeongyeong, can you show an example to Chahee? 

1537
00:58:42,834 --> 00:58:43,964
Show her how it's done. 

1538
00:58:43,964 --> 00:58:45,764
- She looks sad. / - You want me to show her? 

1539
00:58:46,704 --> 00:58:48,634
- She's also your senior. / - Exactly. 

1540
00:58:48,704 --> 00:58:50,004
That's before and after. 

1541
00:58:50,004 --> 00:58:53,364
(Slapping, inchworm dance, monkey,) 

1542
00:58:53,364 --> 00:58:57,064
(babies and excessive expression of refreshment) 

1543
00:58:57,064 --> 00:58:58,204
Look at her. 

1544
00:58:58,204 --> 00:58:59,334
It looks so refreshing. 

1545
00:58:59,334 --> 00:59:01,734
- It might be funny if you copy me. / - Okay. 

1546
00:59:02,234 --> 00:59:05,204
I can do a zombie dance and you can copy me. 

1547
00:59:05,204 --> 00:59:06,304
- What's the zombie dance? / - What's that? 

1548
00:59:06,304 --> 00:59:08,564
- The zombie dance? / - Yes, she can copy me. 

1549
00:59:08,564 --> 00:59:09,764
Here comes the train. 

1550
00:59:10,234 --> 00:59:11,604
You can play any music. 

1551
00:59:13,034 --> 00:59:14,164
(This is for the passengers of Train to Entertainment.) 

1552
00:59:14,164 --> 00:59:15,664
(This is for the passengers of Train to Entertainment.) 

1553
00:59:18,304 --> 00:59:20,764
(She loses herself.) 

1554
00:59:21,664 --> 00:59:23,904
- Oh, my. / - What is that? 

1555
00:59:23,904 --> 00:59:26,264
What's that? Where did she learn that? 

1556
00:59:26,964 --> 00:59:28,664
The fans of "Train to Busan" would love it. 

1557
00:59:29,464 --> 00:59:30,534
Oh, dear. 

1558
00:59:30,734 --> 00:59:31,734
(This girl is a little scary.) 

1559
00:59:31,734 --> 00:59:34,464
- She's got swag. / - She's got swag. 

1560
00:59:34,804 --> 00:59:35,964
- Wow! / - Hey! 

1561
00:59:36,334 --> 00:59:37,334
- She's got swag. / - Wow. 

1562
00:59:40,064 --> 00:59:41,234
(In order to survive on this train,) 

1563
00:59:41,704 --> 00:59:43,034
Brava, Hyeongyeong. 

1564
00:59:43,034 --> 00:59:45,064
(you shouldn't be scared. Be scary instead.) 

1565
00:59:46,264 --> 00:59:48,564
Brava! 

1566
00:59:48,564 --> 00:59:50,364
You are the best. 

1567
00:59:50,934 --> 00:59:52,764
That was amazing. 

1568
00:59:52,764 --> 00:59:54,804
- I think the director would want to cast her. / - Yes. 

1569
00:59:54,804 --> 00:59:57,504
- It's for a zombie movie. / - I want to do it. 

1570
00:59:57,504 --> 00:59:59,534
I can do a good job. 

1571
01:00:00,304 --> 01:00:01,504
How do you do the zombie dance? 

1572
01:00:01,504 --> 01:00:03,334
Your arms have to move separately. 

1573
01:00:03,334 --> 01:00:05,164
You do it like this. 

1574
01:00:05,864 --> 01:00:08,064
(That cracking sound wasn't a sound effect.) 

1575
01:00:08,464 --> 01:00:10,604
She's really good. 

1576
01:00:10,604 --> 01:00:12,934
- Like this. / - She's really good. 

1577
01:00:12,934 --> 01:00:14,134
(Zombie Hyeongyeong) 

1578
01:00:15,034 --> 01:00:16,104
(infects the Train to Entertainment.) 

1579
01:00:16,104 --> 01:00:17,104
It's a zombie! 

1580
01:00:17,404 --> 01:00:20,204
(These young zombie girls) 

1581
01:00:20,204 --> 01:00:23,734
(are full of energy.) 

1582
01:00:25,564 --> 01:00:26,564
She's good. 

1583
01:00:26,564 --> 01:00:28,404
(She's not sexy any more.) 

1584
01:00:28,404 --> 01:00:30,964
- She's cute. / - I will bite you all! 

1585
01:00:30,964 --> 01:00:33,064
I will bite you all! 

1586
01:00:33,634 --> 01:00:36,034
- She did it again. / - It looks like 

1587
01:00:36,034 --> 01:00:37,404
- she's always excited. / - Yerin, 

1588
01:00:37,404 --> 01:00:39,834
- It's an homage to Taeyang. / - can you dance, too? 

1589
01:00:39,834 --> 01:00:42,134
- Yes, I can. / - Please dance for us. 

1590
01:00:42,134 --> 01:00:43,504
I really love 

1591
01:00:43,504 --> 01:00:45,504
- her dance. / - I don't think she can be a zombie. 

1592
01:00:45,504 --> 01:00:48,334
(When the others were showing their talents,) 

1593
01:00:48,334 --> 01:00:51,464
(she was just smiling brightly.) 

1594
01:00:52,334 --> 01:00:54,534
(Yerin is a lovely girl from GFriend.) 

1595
01:00:55,364 --> 01:00:56,434
Let's see. 

1596
01:00:57,204 --> 01:00:59,164
That's it. She starts dancing. 

1597
01:00:59,204 --> 01:01:00,804
(What kind of zombie would she be?) 

1598
01:01:02,434 --> 01:01:03,564
Now you got bitten. 

1599
01:01:04,864 --> 01:01:07,434
(Zombie Yerin moves wildly.) 

1600
01:01:11,364 --> 01:01:12,904
That was nice! 

1601
01:01:12,904 --> 01:01:13,964
(She becomes normal again.) 

1602
01:01:15,004 --> 01:01:16,234
She's charming. 

1603
01:01:16,234 --> 01:01:17,634
- I'm glad we made her dance. / - She got bitten. 

1604
01:01:26,704 --> 01:01:29,234
Sejeong, you became a singer because of your grandma? 

1605
01:01:29,234 --> 01:01:31,864
My grandma has hearing problems. 

1606
01:01:31,864 --> 01:01:34,004
When I was growing up, she always turned on 

1607
01:01:34,004 --> 01:01:35,864
trot music loudly. 

1608
01:01:35,864 --> 01:01:37,434
So I started singing along, 

1609
01:01:37,434 --> 01:01:40,864
and it inspired me to become a trot singer. 

1610
01:01:40,864 --> 01:01:41,934
Are you good at singing trot songs? 

1611
01:01:42,264 --> 01:01:45,304
I love Jang Yoonjeong's songs. 

1612
01:01:45,834 --> 01:01:48,904
(She starts singing a trot song.) 

1613
01:01:48,904 --> 01:01:50,564
That's it. This is how you sing. 

1614
01:01:50,564 --> 01:01:53,164
♪ Just go without words ♪ 

1615
01:01:53,164 --> 01:01:55,964
- The point is to drop your voice. / - That's it! 

1616
01:01:55,964 --> 01:01:57,264
- You dropped your voice. / - Right. 

1617
01:01:57,264 --> 01:01:59,034
Your voice went all the way down and came up. 

1618
01:01:59,064 --> 01:02:00,534
I practiced a lot. 

1619
01:02:00,604 --> 01:02:02,564
- Yes. / - Your grandma must've been happy. 

1620
01:02:02,564 --> 01:02:04,904
Recently, I've been too busy. 

1621
01:02:04,904 --> 01:02:08,904
I haven't been able to visit my sick grandpa. 

1622
01:02:08,904 --> 01:02:11,834
His condition is getting worse. 

1623
01:02:12,464 --> 01:02:13,904
When I think about those things, 

1624
01:02:13,904 --> 01:02:15,864
it makes me sad and 

1625
01:02:15,864 --> 01:02:17,534
I sometimes regret becoming a celebrity. 

1626
01:02:17,534 --> 01:02:20,704
- But it was tough to get this far. / - Yes. 

1627
01:02:20,704 --> 01:02:22,604
Everything is turning out well now, 

1628
01:02:22,604 --> 01:02:24,734
but you're worried that your popularity will fade. 

1629
01:02:24,734 --> 01:02:26,364
The reason why I'm feeling that 

1630
01:02:26,364 --> 01:02:28,704
is because this happened all too fast. 

1631
01:02:28,704 --> 01:02:30,334
I was just a trainee, 

1632
01:02:30,334 --> 01:02:32,864
and I suddenly debuted through that show. 

1633
01:02:32,864 --> 01:02:34,504
It didn't make me just a bit popular 

1634
01:02:34,504 --> 01:02:36,164
but massively famous. 

1635
01:02:36,164 --> 01:02:39,664
So it was hard to accept it as a reality. 

1636
01:02:39,664 --> 01:02:42,764
I felt that if someone hits me, 

1637
01:02:42,764 --> 01:02:45,564
I'd wake up from this dream. Wait. I'm... 

1638
01:02:45,564 --> 01:02:47,304
I'm getting emotional. 

1639
01:02:48,634 --> 01:02:51,504
So... That happened. 

1640
01:02:51,504 --> 01:02:54,264
- What's wrong with me? / - It's okay. 

1641
01:02:54,264 --> 01:02:56,434
- It's okay to cry. / - It's okay. 

1642
01:02:56,434 --> 01:02:57,864
No. So, 

1643
01:02:57,864 --> 01:03:00,234
since it happened all too fast, I feel like... 

1644
01:03:00,234 --> 01:03:01,464
(She can't calm down.) 

1645
01:03:03,564 --> 01:03:05,404
I'm afraid that I will wake up from this dream 

1646
01:03:05,404 --> 01:03:07,504
if I.O.I isn't popular any more. 

1647
01:03:07,504 --> 01:03:08,564
I used to feel that way, 

1648
01:03:08,864 --> 01:03:11,064
but I realized that I can establish myself 

1649
01:03:11,064 --> 01:03:13,334
and make my place in this industry. I shouldn't worry. 

1650
01:03:13,334 --> 01:03:16,664
- Right. / - Will your grandparents watch this? 

1651
01:03:17,134 --> 01:03:19,864
Elders watch KBS. 

1652
01:03:19,864 --> 01:03:21,904
Please send your grandma a message. 

1653
01:03:21,904 --> 01:03:23,304
She's a good granddaughter. 

1654
01:03:23,304 --> 01:03:26,364
- She must miss her granddaughter. / - Yes. 

1655
01:03:26,364 --> 01:03:28,204
- I hope this will be aired. / - What? 

1656
01:03:28,204 --> 01:03:31,164
- The part I was handing her tissue. / - Probably not. 

1657
01:03:31,864 --> 01:03:33,504
Please send them a video message. 

1658
01:03:34,134 --> 01:03:35,864
Where do I look? Okay. 

1659
01:03:36,404 --> 01:03:37,464
Okay. 

1660
01:03:40,964 --> 01:03:42,204
(She's overwhelmed.) 

1661
01:03:45,404 --> 01:03:46,564
- I feel like crying. / - It's okay. 

1662
01:03:46,564 --> 01:03:48,434
(The word "family" makes everyone emotional.) 

1663
01:03:48,434 --> 01:03:49,704
Grandpa. 

1664
01:03:49,704 --> 01:03:51,064
Oh, no. 

1665
01:03:52,104 --> 01:03:54,734
I wasn't going to cry. 

1666
01:03:57,534 --> 01:04:01,264
I said I'd go see my grandpa when I'd become a singer. 

1667
01:04:02,764 --> 01:04:05,434
I'm still a novice in this industry, 

1668
01:04:05,434 --> 01:04:07,464
so it's hard for me to make time. 

1669
01:04:07,964 --> 01:04:11,064
I will make time soon 

1670
01:04:11,064 --> 01:04:12,634
and visit you. 

1671
01:04:13,064 --> 01:04:14,764
So don't get sicker. 

1672
01:04:14,764 --> 01:04:17,804
Please hang on for a little more. 

1673
01:04:17,804 --> 01:04:20,004
I will visit you very soon. I'm on TV a lot, 

1674
01:04:20,004 --> 01:04:22,434
so please always watch KBS. I came out here today 

1675
01:04:22,434 --> 01:04:24,234
and did a lot of things. 

1676
01:04:25,734 --> 01:04:28,204
Please watch because I will appear on it frequently. 

1677
01:04:28,204 --> 01:04:31,064
And don't get sick. 

1678
01:04:31,064 --> 01:04:33,104
I love you both, Grandma and Grandpa. 

1679
01:04:34,604 --> 01:04:35,604
(Jaeseok spots something.) 

1680
01:04:35,604 --> 01:04:38,564
- Oh, my. / - I'm proud of her. 

1681
01:04:38,564 --> 01:04:40,664
Hand some tissue to Solbin, too. 

1682
01:04:40,664 --> 01:04:43,104
- Why is she also crying? / - Pass it to her. 

1683
01:04:43,234 --> 01:04:45,134
- I'll hand it to her. / - Everyone's crying. 

1684
01:04:45,134 --> 01:04:47,064
- You can hand it to them. / - Thank you. 

1685
01:04:47,434 --> 01:04:48,904
Don't use too much of it. 

1686
01:04:48,904 --> 01:04:51,934
- Saeho. / - What's that? 

1687
01:04:51,934 --> 01:04:54,434
Get more only if you really need it. 

1688
01:04:54,464 --> 01:04:57,064
Chahee, you didn't cry though. 

1689
01:04:59,364 --> 01:05:01,564
- Chahee. / - Why do you need tissue? 

1690
01:05:01,564 --> 01:05:04,404
- She... / - She's using it to clean her face. 

1691
01:05:04,404 --> 01:05:07,304
- She's taking out the eye dirt. / - Chahee. 

1692
01:05:07,804 --> 01:05:08,934
She's not crying. 

1693
01:05:08,934 --> 01:05:11,204
You can't poke your eyes to make yourself cry. 

1694
01:05:11,804 --> 01:05:13,834
- You can't do that. / - She poked her eyes. 

1695
01:05:13,834 --> 01:05:17,204
- Chahee is trending online. / - For her fake tears. 

1696
01:05:17,204 --> 01:05:18,804
- She's faking her tears. / - She is. 

1697
01:05:18,804 --> 01:05:20,534
She's faking it. 

1698
01:05:20,534 --> 01:05:21,534
I know. 

1699
01:05:21,534 --> 01:05:22,864
(Train to Entertainment) 

1700
01:05:22,864 --> 01:05:25,304
Happy Together prepared a special event 

1701
01:05:25,304 --> 01:05:27,504
for the hard-working girl group members. 

1702
01:05:27,504 --> 01:05:29,504
This is the "Water Gun Dance Room"! 

1703
01:05:29,504 --> 01:05:31,264
("Water Gun Dance Room") 

1704
01:05:31,634 --> 01:05:33,804
First of all, watch the video we prepared. 

1705
01:05:33,804 --> 01:05:37,864
Then, you have to copy the dance routine. 

1706
01:05:37,864 --> 01:05:41,234
You have to succeed in ten tries. Okay? 

1707
01:05:41,234 --> 01:05:43,604
If you fail, we will shoot you 

1708
01:05:43,604 --> 01:05:45,404
- with water guns. / - They work well. 

1709
01:05:45,404 --> 01:05:46,434
Yes. 

1710
01:05:46,964 --> 01:05:48,464
(Hyunmoo squirts it at Jaeseok.) 

1711
01:05:49,834 --> 01:05:51,404
(It's surprisingly scary.) 

1712
01:05:52,664 --> 01:05:53,734
(They demonstrate the water gun shooting.) 

1713
01:05:53,734 --> 01:05:54,964
Stop it. 

1714
01:05:56,064 --> 01:05:57,134
That was a good one. 

1715
01:05:57,134 --> 01:05:58,234
(It shoots water very well.) 

1716
01:05:58,564 --> 01:06:00,804
- Stop it! / - Be careful with the mic. 

1717
01:06:00,804 --> 01:06:02,704
- The mic. / - Be mindful of it. 

1718
01:06:02,704 --> 01:06:04,164
- Are you all right? / - I'm okay. 

1719
01:06:04,164 --> 01:06:05,804
She's truly an actress. 

1720
01:06:07,604 --> 01:06:09,704
The dance you're about to watch 

1721
01:06:09,704 --> 01:06:12,704
is like a textbook of a girl group dance. 

1722
01:06:12,704 --> 01:06:15,534
It's Girls' Generation's "Gee". 

1723
01:06:16,264 --> 01:06:19,804
("Gee" has the legendary dance.) 

1724
01:06:20,264 --> 01:06:22,534
- Sunny, do you remember the dance? / - Of course. 

1725
01:06:22,534 --> 01:06:24,364
- Of course. / - We still do it for concerts. 

1726
01:06:24,364 --> 01:06:26,004
- I see. / - I see. 

1727
01:06:26,004 --> 01:06:29,364
I'm curious if any of you has tried doing this dance. 

1728
01:06:29,534 --> 01:06:31,704
- I have done it. / - You have? 

1729
01:06:31,704 --> 01:06:34,164
Yes. Right. 

1730
01:06:34,304 --> 01:06:35,364
That's not the right dance. 

1731
01:06:36,564 --> 01:06:39,434
I've done the dance on another channel 

1732
01:06:39,434 --> 01:06:41,704
- with GFriend and Twice members. / - You've done it. 

1733
01:06:41,704 --> 01:06:44,664
- I practiced it alone. / - I haven't done it. 

1734
01:06:44,764 --> 01:06:46,504
- I see. / - You're unlucky. 

1735
01:06:46,504 --> 01:06:48,534
I've never danced to "Gee". 

1736
01:06:48,534 --> 01:06:53,034
In that case, Sejeong and Chahee have to do well. 

1737
01:06:53,034 --> 01:06:55,664
Only when you two do a good job, 

1738
01:06:55,664 --> 01:06:57,404
you will succeed it in ten tries. 

1739
01:06:57,404 --> 01:06:58,604
No. I am sorry. 

1740
01:06:58,604 --> 01:07:00,304
- I am sorry. / - Hey. 

1741
01:07:00,304 --> 01:07:02,834
Cheer up, girls. 

1742
01:07:02,834 --> 01:07:05,964
Sunny might be too familiar with the routine, 

1743
01:07:06,164 --> 01:07:08,334
so we changed it up a little. 

1744
01:07:08,634 --> 01:07:10,934
Let's watch the video first. 

1745
01:07:14,504 --> 01:07:17,534
(Solbin) 

1746
01:07:19,234 --> 01:07:20,404
(This move is for everyone.) 

1747
01:07:20,404 --> 01:07:22,264
- That's easy. / - That's hard. 

1748
01:07:22,264 --> 01:07:23,464
- That's hard. / - I did it, too. 

1749
01:07:23,664 --> 01:07:24,734
(Yerin) 

1750
01:07:24,764 --> 01:07:26,704
- That's for Yerin. / - You have to do that. 

1751
01:07:27,064 --> 01:07:28,564
Can you remember that? 

1752
01:07:29,034 --> 01:07:30,834
- How can they remember that? / - How can they? 

1753
01:07:31,034 --> 01:07:32,864
- They're not familiar with the dance. / - Try it. 

1754
01:07:32,864 --> 01:07:34,704
(This move is for everyone.) 

1755
01:07:34,704 --> 01:07:36,534
That's easy. This is easy. 

1756
01:07:36,864 --> 01:07:37,864
What? 

1757
01:07:38,004 --> 01:07:39,734
- Isn't that too hard? / - That's too hard. 

1758
01:07:39,734 --> 01:07:40,804
(It's slightly different from the original dance.) 

1759
01:07:41,004 --> 01:07:43,264
(They clap each other's hands.) 

1760
01:07:43,734 --> 01:07:45,534
- What? / - That's too tricky. 

1761
01:07:45,534 --> 01:07:46,534
That's hard. 

1762
01:07:46,534 --> 01:07:49,104
How can we do that? 

1763
01:07:49,104 --> 01:07:51,204
Will we manage it in a day? 

1764
01:07:51,264 --> 01:07:52,634
Come on. You're a member of a girl group. 

1765
01:07:52,704 --> 01:07:55,434
- All right, everyone. / - It's hard. 

1766
01:07:56,234 --> 01:07:57,904
I think it's a little difficult. 

1767
01:07:57,904 --> 01:08:00,934
If it's the same dance, I'd teach them. 

1768
01:08:01,634 --> 01:08:03,504
- However, they changed it. / - Right. 

1769
01:08:03,504 --> 01:08:06,764
They made tiny changes to every move. 

1770
01:08:06,904 --> 01:08:08,904
I might be the bad one today. 

1771
01:08:08,904 --> 01:08:11,134
We are flustered as well. 

1772
01:08:11,134 --> 01:08:13,704
It looks like we'd need too much water. 

1773
01:08:14,664 --> 01:08:17,134
I was watching you. You might make a lot of mistakes. 

1774
01:08:17,134 --> 01:08:19,404
- Let's do this. / - Let's go, girls! 

1775
01:08:19,404 --> 01:08:20,434
Let's bring it up. 

1776
01:08:21,304 --> 01:08:22,434
- One, two, three. / - One, two, three. 

1777
01:08:22,434 --> 01:08:24,164
- Let's go! / - Let's go! 

1778
01:08:24,164 --> 01:08:25,164
(Let's survive this.) 

1779
01:08:25,164 --> 01:08:26,704
- Yes! / - Brava. 

1780
01:08:26,704 --> 01:08:28,804
This is their first attempt. 

1781
01:08:28,804 --> 01:08:30,304
Give us the music. 

1782
01:08:30,404 --> 01:08:31,974
(They observe sharply.) 

1783
01:08:34,064 --> 01:08:35,334
- Look at her. / - She's good. 

1784
01:08:36,064 --> 01:08:38,734
- Solbin is good. / - She's amazing. 

1785
01:08:40,004 --> 01:08:41,034
It's a group move. 

1786
01:08:41,034 --> 01:08:42,204
(They fail.) 

1787
01:08:42,904 --> 01:08:45,104
(They missed the timing.) 

1788
01:08:45,304 --> 01:08:47,304
(Even Sunny got it wrong.) 

1789
01:08:47,804 --> 01:08:49,304
(They shoot water to the girls.) 

1790
01:08:50,134 --> 01:08:51,234
(They protect their faces first.) 

1791
01:08:51,234 --> 01:08:53,104
Please forgive me! 

1792
01:08:53,704 --> 01:08:55,934
- Please, stop! / - Please don't do this. 

1793
01:08:56,704 --> 01:08:59,034
Enjoy the water. 

1794
01:08:59,334 --> 01:09:02,264
That's nice. It's nice here. 

1795
01:09:02,264 --> 01:09:03,664
It's nice over here. 

1796
01:09:03,664 --> 01:09:05,004
- I'm sorry, / - I'm scared. 

1797
01:09:05,564 --> 01:09:08,064
but it was a group move. 

1798
01:09:08,064 --> 01:09:09,974
Your fans are watching. How can you fail? 

1799
01:09:09,974 --> 01:09:12,234
- They need time to discuss. / - You can discuss. 

1800
01:09:12,234 --> 01:09:13,304
(Umbrella Girls is disbanded because they can't dance.) 

1801
01:09:13,804 --> 01:09:15,304
- Cheers! / - Are we doing it again? 

1802
01:09:15,664 --> 01:09:17,764
- Music, please. / - Let's go. 

1803
01:09:20,764 --> 01:09:22,534
- I love that part. / - She's too good. 

1804
01:09:22,534 --> 01:09:24,364
- Solbin is good. / - She is. 

1805
01:09:24,364 --> 01:09:25,834
- It's the group part. / - It's the group part. 

1806
01:09:26,504 --> 01:09:27,634
No. 

1807
01:09:27,934 --> 01:09:29,034
- It's the group part. / - It's the group part. 

1808
01:09:29,064 --> 01:09:30,664
(Solji's legs are wrong.) 

1809
01:09:31,504 --> 01:09:34,474
Stop it. Stop it. 

1810
01:09:34,474 --> 01:09:36,364
(They suddenly become polite.) 

1811
01:09:36,474 --> 01:09:37,564
(We hope getting shot with water) 

1812
01:09:37,564 --> 01:09:38,564
(will cool you down.) 

1813
01:09:39,764 --> 01:09:43,474
(They get shower.) 

1814
01:09:44,664 --> 01:09:45,934
(If you can't avoid it, enjoy it.) 

1815
01:09:45,934 --> 01:09:47,264
They look tired. 

1816
01:09:47,334 --> 01:09:49,704
- Solbin. / - What are you doing, Sejeong? 

1817
01:09:49,764 --> 01:09:50,864
Oh, gosh. 

1818
01:09:51,234 --> 01:09:52,864
- It hurts. / - Sejeong. 

1819
01:09:53,064 --> 01:09:54,864
- Your hair is flat. / - Protect your face. 

1820
01:09:54,864 --> 01:09:56,704
- It's too late now. / - Yes. 

1821
01:09:56,704 --> 01:09:58,234
They didn't practice the group part. 

1822
01:09:58,234 --> 01:09:59,904
I'm sorry, but you look like Kim Kyungho. 

1823
01:10:01,064 --> 01:10:03,204
(From behind, she looks like Kim Kyungho.) 

1824
01:10:03,264 --> 01:10:04,734
(She's a mix of Im Wonhee and Kim Kyungho.) 

1825
01:10:05,134 --> 01:10:08,164
(I look like both Wonhee and Kyungho.) 

1826
01:10:08,474 --> 01:10:11,204
All right. Here we go. It's the fifth try. 

1827
01:10:11,304 --> 01:10:12,304
Go! 

1828
01:10:13,064 --> 01:10:14,404
(Solbin does it perfectly every time.) 

1829
01:10:14,934 --> 01:10:16,934
She's good. 

1830
01:10:16,934 --> 01:10:18,134
- They're doing it together. / - That's good. 

1831
01:10:18,434 --> 01:10:19,664
(They fail again.) 

1832
01:10:19,934 --> 01:10:24,304
- Why? Why? / - Why? Why? 

1833
01:10:24,304 --> 01:10:25,564
Why did we fail? 

1834
01:10:26,304 --> 01:10:27,704
- Sejeong made a mistake. / - I did? 

1835
01:10:27,704 --> 01:10:28,864
What did I do? 

1836
01:10:29,064 --> 01:10:31,404
- They're good. / - They are. 

1837
01:10:31,404 --> 01:10:33,234
(Sejeong's legs were in different direction.) 

1838
01:10:34,564 --> 01:10:36,164
I'm in trouble. I'm in trouble. 

1839
01:10:36,534 --> 01:10:39,634
- It's okay. / - You can do it again. 

1840
01:10:39,664 --> 01:10:41,764
♪ Gee, gee, gee, gee, baby, baby, baby ♪ 

1841
01:10:41,764 --> 01:10:43,634
- You should do this too. / - They will... 

1842
01:10:43,634 --> 01:10:45,504
Who are you? 

1843
01:10:45,704 --> 01:10:47,864
(It's me, Sunny.) 

1844
01:10:47,974 --> 01:10:49,034
(Sejeong just laughs it off.) 

1845
01:10:49,034 --> 01:10:51,164
- I keep getting it wrong. / - Who is she? 

1846
01:10:51,164 --> 01:10:53,164
- Was her forehead that big? / - Yes! 

1847
01:10:53,864 --> 01:10:55,534
Your forehead is beautiful! 

1848
01:10:56,364 --> 01:10:57,434
(Sunny's compliment makes her excited!) 

1849
01:10:57,434 --> 01:10:59,864
- It's nice. / - Let's do it. 

1850
01:11:00,234 --> 01:11:03,134
All right. Ready? This is the sixth try. 

1851
01:11:03,474 --> 01:11:04,504
Let's go! 

1852
01:11:04,604 --> 01:11:05,974
What if they fail again? 

1853
01:11:06,204 --> 01:11:07,664
(Solbin could dance even with her eyes closed.) 

1854
01:11:08,204 --> 01:11:09,804
(Everyone dances in sync.) 

1855
01:11:10,534 --> 01:11:11,764
(Sejeong gets the legs wrong again.) 

1856
01:11:12,364 --> 01:11:13,664
Sejeong! 

1857
01:11:15,664 --> 01:11:16,934
(Oh, dear.) 

1858
01:11:17,864 --> 01:11:19,934
Sejeong! 

1859
01:11:19,934 --> 01:11:22,064
- Oh, no! / - Sejeong! 

1860
01:11:22,304 --> 01:11:25,204
- I am sorry! / - Sejeong! 

1861
01:11:25,764 --> 01:11:29,604
- I'm sorry. / - Group dance is not her forte. 

1862
01:11:29,864 --> 01:11:31,764
(Sunny disappears suddenly.) 

1863
01:11:31,764 --> 01:11:33,164
- I'm getting sick. / - Chahee hasn't done anything. 

1864
01:11:33,164 --> 01:11:35,474
- Sunny. / - They will use up their chances. 

1865
01:11:36,864 --> 01:11:38,434
I'm getting sick. 

1866
01:11:38,864 --> 01:11:41,104
- Who came up with this idea? / - Take time to discuss. 

1867
01:11:41,364 --> 01:11:43,064
(Sunny's tired.) 

1868
01:11:43,064 --> 01:11:45,064
Can you cut us some slack? 

1869
01:11:45,764 --> 01:11:47,104
Don't be too hard on us. 

1870
01:11:47,364 --> 01:11:48,974
- Let's watch it again. / - They did quite well. 

1871
01:11:48,974 --> 01:11:50,864
- Give them a chance. / - Let us watch it again. 

1872
01:11:50,864 --> 01:11:52,904
Sunny, then show us a zombie dance. 

1873
01:11:53,474 --> 01:11:55,364
- Sunny. / - She's going to do it? 

1874
01:11:55,434 --> 01:11:56,664
(Are you really going to do it?) 

1875
01:11:56,664 --> 01:11:57,704
Let's go. 

1876
01:11:57,704 --> 01:11:59,864
(Will she do the zombie dance for the girls?) 

1877
01:12:01,364 --> 01:12:03,134
(This is Sunny's zombie dance.) 

1878
01:12:03,164 --> 01:12:04,404
(What?) 

1879
01:12:04,504 --> 01:12:05,534
Don't smile. 

1880
01:12:06,034 --> 01:12:07,034
Don't smile. 

1881
01:12:08,634 --> 01:12:11,064
- Oh, gosh. / - She's sexy. 

1882
01:12:11,104 --> 01:12:13,004
(She's a sexy zombie.) 

1883
01:12:14,164 --> 01:12:17,304
(The sexy zombie goes clubbing.) 

1884
01:12:18,564 --> 01:12:20,474
- She did it. / - Hurry up and show us. 

1885
01:12:20,474 --> 01:12:22,434
We'll let you watch it again. 

1886
01:12:23,034 --> 01:12:24,064
How can you do that? 

1887
01:12:24,064 --> 01:12:26,864
(They have the last chance to watch the dance.) 

1888
01:12:26,864 --> 01:12:28,264
- Music! / - Let's go, girls! 

1889
01:12:28,434 --> 01:12:29,434
- Let's go, Sejeong. / - Let's go! 

1890
01:12:29,434 --> 01:12:30,934
- Let's go! / - Cue! 

1891
01:12:31,804 --> 01:12:32,804
Okay. 

1892
01:12:32,804 --> 01:12:34,634
(They have three more chances.) 

1893
01:12:34,634 --> 01:12:37,234
(Will they be able to finish it?) 

1894
01:12:38,404 --> 01:12:40,834
- ♪ Gee, gee, gee, gee ♪ / - ♪ Baby, baby, baby ♪ 

1895
01:12:41,004 --> 01:12:43,404
(The girls are used to solders' loud cheers.) 

1896
01:12:43,564 --> 01:12:46,064
(The cheers give them energy!) 

1897
01:12:48,064 --> 01:12:50,504
- ♪ Gee, gee, gee, gee ♪ / - ♪ Baby, baby, baby ♪ 

1898
01:12:50,504 --> 01:12:51,504
(They shout like soldiers.) 

1899
01:12:53,234 --> 01:12:55,764
(It's time for the second group part.) 

1900
01:12:56,704 --> 01:12:58,164
- Oh, dear. / - They did it. 

1901
01:12:58,304 --> 01:12:59,304
They did it. 

1902
01:12:59,704 --> 01:13:02,404
(The second group dance) 

1903
01:13:02,404 --> 01:13:03,974
(Success) 

1904
01:13:04,004 --> 01:13:06,164
(It's Sunny's part.) 

1905
01:13:07,034 --> 01:13:08,534
- They're good. / - You're doing well. 

1906
01:13:08,534 --> 01:13:09,704
(Sunny) 

1907
01:13:09,704 --> 01:13:10,864
(succeeds her part.) 

1908
01:13:12,504 --> 01:13:13,974
(This is by far the most successful try.) 

1909
01:13:13,974 --> 01:13:14,974
Good job. 

1910
01:13:15,634 --> 01:13:17,004
That's good. 

1911
01:13:17,234 --> 01:13:18,864
- It's dangerous. / - Let's go! 

1912
01:13:19,734 --> 01:13:21,564
- Good job. / - Good job. 

1913
01:13:22,234 --> 01:13:24,064
- Go, girls. / - Come on. 

1914
01:13:24,064 --> 01:13:25,534
(When they manage this part,) 

1915
01:13:25,534 --> 01:13:26,604
Good job. 

1916
01:13:26,604 --> 01:13:29,474
(Sejeong's and Chahee's parts remain.) 

1917
01:13:31,364 --> 01:13:33,404
(Will they succeed or fail?) 

1918
01:13:34,634 --> 01:13:35,704
(It's the third group part.) 

1919
01:13:35,704 --> 01:13:37,504
(They succeed.) 

1920
01:13:37,504 --> 01:13:38,564
(It's Sejeong's part.) 

1921
01:13:38,564 --> 01:13:39,764
(Oh, my gosh!) 

1922
01:13:40,564 --> 01:13:42,164
(Sunny gives a signal.) 

1923
01:13:42,934 --> 01:13:44,474
(But she doesn't know what to do with her hands.) 

1924
01:13:44,504 --> 01:13:45,804
(This is the original move.) 

1925
01:13:46,134 --> 01:13:48,474
(Sejeong fails.) 

1926
01:13:49,164 --> 01:13:50,334
Gosh. 

1927
01:13:50,334 --> 01:13:51,864
You were so close. 

1928
01:13:51,864 --> 01:13:53,264
Gosh. 

1929
01:13:53,864 --> 01:13:54,864
Sejeong. 

1930
01:13:55,534 --> 01:13:56,534
(They cover her.) 

1931
01:13:56,534 --> 01:13:57,664
- You were so close. / - Gosh! 

1932
01:13:58,704 --> 01:14:02,504
I was glad we did the hard parts. 

1933
01:14:02,504 --> 01:14:04,474
And I wasn't ready for my part. 

1934
01:14:05,304 --> 01:14:06,704
This is the eighth try. 

1935
01:14:08,234 --> 01:14:09,234
One. 

1936
01:14:10,264 --> 01:14:16,404
(The six girls are reborn as Girls' Generation.) 

1937
01:14:18,764 --> 01:14:23,164
(Now Sejeong has to do her part.) 

1938
01:14:28,164 --> 01:14:29,304
It's Sejeong's part. 

1939
01:14:29,564 --> 01:14:30,604
(She's always made mistakes.) 

1940
01:14:30,604 --> 01:14:31,634
(Will she succeed this time?) 

1941
01:14:33,204 --> 01:14:35,734
(Everyone pays attention.) 

1942
01:14:36,834 --> 01:14:38,034
(Please, Sejeong.) 

1943
01:14:38,604 --> 01:14:39,664
It's Sejeong's part. 

1944
01:14:41,164 --> 01:14:42,264
(She's good.) 

1945
01:14:42,264 --> 01:14:43,264
That's good. 

1946
01:14:44,064 --> 01:14:46,364
- Good job. / - Good job. 

1947
01:14:46,364 --> 01:14:48,734
- Nice! / - Go, Sejeong! 

1948
01:14:49,934 --> 01:14:51,364
♪ Do I lack courage ♪ 

1949
01:14:51,864 --> 01:14:53,864
- You're doing good. / - ♪ What should I do ♪ 

1950
01:14:54,434 --> 01:14:55,864
- Good job! / - They have to get through this part. 

1951
01:14:55,864 --> 01:14:56,934
They're good. 

1952
01:14:57,764 --> 01:14:59,474
- Here we go again. / - They're good. 

1953
01:15:00,134 --> 01:15:01,234
It's the finale. 

1954
01:15:01,234 --> 01:15:02,434
(Long-awaited final part) 

1955
01:15:04,004 --> 01:15:07,564
(Will they succeed?) 

1956
01:15:13,804 --> 01:15:14,804
Awesome! 

1957
01:15:15,664 --> 01:15:16,664
Gather up, girls. 

1958
01:15:16,664 --> 01:15:19,474
(They succeed on the last part!) 

1959
01:15:22,234 --> 01:15:25,364
(They did it in eight tries.) 

1960
01:15:26,904 --> 01:15:28,474
Good job. 

1961
01:15:28,504 --> 01:15:29,534
(Cheering) 

1962
01:15:30,534 --> 01:15:32,804
- We did it! / - Good job! 

1963
01:15:32,804 --> 01:15:34,364
Good job, girls. 

1964
01:15:34,364 --> 01:15:36,164
Good job. 

1965
01:15:36,164 --> 01:15:38,474
Great job. 

1966
01:15:39,434 --> 01:15:40,934
We used up all the water. 

1967
01:15:41,534 --> 01:15:44,634
They're Korea's best girl groups. 

1968
01:15:44,634 --> 01:15:46,534
I'm worried that you will see me 

1969
01:15:46,704 --> 01:15:49,664
and think girl groups aren't that talented. 

1970
01:15:49,764 --> 01:15:50,804
It's just me, everybody. 

1971
01:15:50,804 --> 01:15:53,364
- The same goes for me. / - It's just us. 

1972
01:15:53,434 --> 01:15:55,164
- The others are very talented. / - You did well. 

1973
01:15:55,164 --> 01:15:56,334
Don't be mistaken. 

1974
01:15:56,334 --> 01:15:57,934
- You did well. / - We did well. 

1975
01:15:58,474 --> 01:15:59,534
- You're amazing. / - That was good. 

1976
01:15:59,534 --> 01:16:00,564
Thank you. 

1977
01:16:00,864 --> 01:16:03,334
Thank you everyone for joining us today. 

1978
01:16:03,334 --> 01:16:05,404
We'll be back next time with something better. 

1979
01:16:05,404 --> 01:16:08,834
- Thank you. / - Thank you. 

1980
01:16:08,934 --> 01:16:11,664
DinDin, Crush and Loco! 

1981
01:16:12,064 --> 01:16:13,564
(DinDin is a great entertainer and rapper.) 

1982
01:16:13,564 --> 01:16:15,164
(Loco is the leader of trendy hip hop.) 

1983
01:16:15,304 --> 01:16:18,264
(Crush is music chart king.) 

1984
01:16:20,164 --> 01:16:21,264
He's amazing. 

1985
01:16:21,504 --> 01:16:23,234
(However,) 

1986
01:16:23,264 --> 01:16:24,664
(their true personalities are revealed.) 

1987
01:16:25,564 --> 01:16:26,664
(They argue.) 

1988
01:16:26,664 --> 01:16:28,234
I was always with you at clubs. 

1989
01:16:28,264 --> 01:16:30,664
- Let's sue him. / - Are you middle schoolers? 

1990
01:16:31,534 --> 01:16:33,164
I went in a hostess bar. 

1991
01:16:33,164 --> 01:16:35,104
- It was a hotel room. / - Really? 

1992
01:16:35,504 --> 01:16:37,804
(Don't miss the next episode.) 

1993
