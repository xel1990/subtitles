315
00:21:25,033 --> 00:21:27,618
It's time to take the pin out.

316
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:33,457
Yeah.

317
00:21:34,084 --> 00:21:38,004
You'll find someone. I know you will.
The right woman is waiting for you.

318
00:21:38,255 --> 00:21:41,090
It's easy for you to say.
You found one already.

319
00:21:43,593 --> 00:21:46,470
All you need is a woman who likes men
and you'll be set.

320
00:21:50,726 --> 00:21:51,934
Not her.

321
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:05,489
We get off around midnight.
Why don't we pick you up then?

322
00:22:05,657 --> 00:22:07,366
RACHEL: Okay.
MONICA: Great.

323
00:22:08,076 --> 00:22:10,703
So, um, will you bring the truck?

324
00:22:13,206 --> 00:22:15,708
- I'll even let you ring the bell.
- Wohoo!

325
00:22:15,876 --> 00:22:18,836
FIREMAN 1: We'll see you later.
FIREMAN 2: Bye. See you later.

326
00:22:19,046 --> 00:22:20,755
Thanks. See you.

327
00:22:21,006 --> 00:22:22,256
Oh, my God.

328
00:22:23,383 --> 00:22:25,092
See, there you go.

329
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:27,720
- The cleansing worked.
MONICA: You're right.

330
00:22:27,971 --> 00:22:29,430
They're nice guys.

331
00:22:29,848 --> 00:22:32,058
They're firemen guys.

332
00:22:33,685 --> 00:22:36,020
FIREMAN 1: You tell them you're married?
FIREMAN 2: No way.

333
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:38,439
My girlfriend doesn't know.
I'm not gonna tell them.
