00:18:31,693 --> 00:18:36,405
- What you guys doing here?
- Uh, we are here to break up with you.

317
00:18:37,699 --> 00:18:38,908
Both of you?

318
00:18:39,243 --> 00:18:43,329
We think you're a horrible human being,
and bad things should happen to you.

319
00:18:45,999 --> 00:18:48,126
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. God, I am so sorry.

320
00:18:48,377 --> 00:18:50,753
I'm an idiot. I was weak.
I couldn't help myself.

321
00:18:50,921 --> 00:18:54,006
Whatever I did, I only did
because I love you so much.

322
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:58,761
Uh, which one of us
are you talking to there, Bar?

323
00:18:59,346 --> 00:19:00,555
Um...

324
00:19:01,849 --> 00:19:02,932
Mindy.

325
00:19:03,267 --> 00:19:05,810
Mindy, of course, Mindy.
It was always Mindy.

326
00:19:06,186 --> 00:19:08,479
Even when we were having sex
in that chair?

327
00:19:08,897 --> 00:19:12,358
I swear, look, whatever I was doing,
I was always thinking of you.

328
00:19:12,526 --> 00:19:14,402
Oh, please.

329
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:17,947
During that second time, you couldn't
have picked her out of a lineup.

330
00:19:18,115 --> 00:19:19,198
You did it twice?

331
00:19:19,533 --> 00:19:22,827
Well, the first time didn't really count.
You know, it was Barry.

332
00:19:23,078 --> 00:19:24,704
Oh, right.

333
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:26,831
Honey, baby, sweetheart, look...

334
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:28,916
Just give me another chance, okay?

335
00:19:29,084 --> 00:19:32,128
We'll start all over again.
We'll go back to Aruba.

336
00:19:34,047 --> 00:19:35,298
What do you say?

Oh, God. Uh, I'll be right there, Bernice.

340
00:19:44,433 --> 00:19:46,726
Look, please,
please don't go anywhere, okay?

341
00:19:46,894 --> 00:19:50,062
- I'll be right back.
- Okay.

342
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:53,232
Okay, and we'll be here, hating you.

343
00:19:54,443 --> 00:19:57,153
See how he was sweating
when he walked out of here?

344
00:19:57,321 --> 00:19:59,697
If I'm hogging the ball,
you jump right in there...

345
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:03,576
...and take a couple of punches.
Because I'm telling you, this feels great.

346
00:20:03,744 --> 00:20:07,622
Yeah, I'm pretty sure
I'm still gonna marry him.

347
00:20:08,749 --> 00:20:10,917
What are you talking about?

348
00:20:11,084 --> 00:20:13,878
Mindy, the guy is the devil.

349
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:16,214
He is Satan in a smock.

350
00:20:17,007 --> 00:20:18,883
Look, I know he's not perfect.

I hope you can find some way
to be happy for me.

And I hope you'll still be
my maid of honor.

And I hope Barry doesn't kill you
and eat you in Aruba.

You okay?

361
00:20:55,963 --> 00:20:57,296
Yeah.

362
00:20:58,090 --> 00:20:59,590

Yeah.

You know, ever since I ran out on Barry
at the wedding...

whether I made the right choice.

Big day.

All right, I'll give you this:
Mr. Peanut is a better dresser.

I mean, he's got the monocle,
he's got the top hat...

Did you know he's gay?

372
00:21:38,964 --> 00:21:43,092
I just wanna clarify this.
Are you outing Mr. Peanut?

00:21:53,895 --> 00:21:55,938
...but it turns out
I had your number wrong.

378
00:21:56,106 --> 00:21:59,442
And when I finally got the right one
from Information, there was no answer.

So I thought I'd just come down here

Oh, uh, I'm okay.

Listen, uh, maybe we could
get together later?

382
00:22:08,618 --> 00:22:11,620
That sounds good. I'll call you.
Or you call me, whatever.
