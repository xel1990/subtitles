1
00:00:02,711 --> 00:00:04,878
Would you let it go?
It's not a big deal.

2
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:06,880
ROSS: Not a big deal?
It's amazing.

3
00:00:07,132 --> 00:00:10,009
You just reach in, there's one
little maneuver, and bam!

4
00:00:10,218 --> 00:00:12,428
A bra. Right out the sleeve.

5
00:00:12,846 --> 00:00:14,179
As far as I'm concerned...

6
00:00:14,431 --> 00:00:17,683
...there is nothing a guy can do
that comes close. Right?

7
00:00:17,934 --> 00:00:20,894
Come on!
You guys can pee standing up.

8
00:00:21,146 --> 00:00:23,355
We can? Okay, I'm trying that.

9
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:26,692
You know what blows my mind?

10
00:00:26,901 --> 00:00:30,154
Women can see breasts
anytime they want.

11
00:00:32,365 --> 00:00:34,533
You just look down,
and there they are.

12
00:00:34,743 --> 00:00:37,286
How you get any work done
is beyond me.

13
00:00:38,788 --> 00:00:42,291
What I don't get is the way
guys can do so many mean things...

14
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:43,917
...and then not even care.

15
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,926
Multiple orgasms!

16
00:01:48,733 --> 00:01:50,526
So Saturday night, the big night.

17
00:01:50,777 --> 00:01:53,904
Date night!
Saturday night. Saturday night!

18
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:58,283
- No plans, huh?
- Not a one.

19
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:01,328
Not even, say,
breaking up with Janice?

20
00:02:01,579 --> 00:02:03,831
Oh, right, right. Shut up.

21
00:02:05,667 --> 00:02:08,460
Chandler, nobody likes
breaking up with someone.

22
00:02:08,753 --> 00:02:12,297
- You just gotta do it.
- I know. But it's just so hard.

23
00:02:12,549 --> 00:02:15,509
You're sitting with her.
She has no idea what's happening.

24
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:18,220
You finally get up
the courage to do it.

25
00:02:18,471 --> 00:02:21,765
There's that awkward moment
when you've handed her the note.

26
00:02:25,478 --> 00:02:27,729
Why do you have to break up with her?

27
00:02:27,939 --> 00:02:30,566
Be a man. Just stop calling.

28
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:35,112
If you want, I'll do it with you.

29
00:02:35,655 --> 00:02:38,991
Thanks, but she'd feel like
we were ganging up on her.

30
00:02:39,242 --> 00:02:41,869
I mean you break up with Janice.
I'll break up with Tony.

31
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,537
You're breaking up with Tony?

32
00:02:43,788 --> 00:02:46,456
I know. He's sweet, but it's just
not fun anymore.

33
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:50,002
I don't know if it's me or
his hunger strike. I don't know.

34
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:53,881
Does anybody want anything else?

35
00:02:54,132 --> 00:02:58,635
Yeah. Last week you had a wonderful nutty,
chocolate-y, kind of cake-y pie thing that...

36
00:03:00,221 --> 00:03:01,805
Nothing. I'm fine.

37
00:03:04,434 --> 00:03:06,393
What's the matter?
Why so scrunchie?

38
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:10,063
It's my father. He wants to give me
a Mercedes convertible.

39
00:03:11,149 --> 00:03:14,193
That guy, he burns me up.

40
00:03:14,736 --> 00:03:17,779
Yeah, well, it's a Mercedes
if I move back home.

41
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:20,949
It was horrible!
He called me "young lady."

42
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:23,577
Ooh, I hate when my father
calls me that.

43
00:03:24,704 --> 00:03:27,956
Did he give you that whole
"You're not up to this" thing again?

44
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:31,168
Yeah, I got the extended disco
version with three choruses of:

45
00:03:31,377 --> 00:03:33,253
"You'll never make it on your own."

Uh-huh, uh-huh

Hi, Joey.

48
00:03:41,095 --> 00:03:42,262
Oh, my God. Angela.

49
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:45,682
Wow. Being dumped by you
obviously agrees with her.

50
00:03:45,934 --> 00:03:47,809
- Are you gonna go over there?
- No.

51
00:03:48,603 --> 00:03:50,103
Yeah. No.

52
00:03:51,314 --> 00:03:54,233
Okay, but not yet.
I don't wanna seem too eager.

You look good.

Because I'm wearing a dress
that accents my boobs.

You don't say.

00:04:24,847 --> 00:04:27,432
So, Rachel, what are you
doing tonight?

61
00:04:27,684 --> 00:04:30,727
Big glamour night.
Me and Monica at Launderama.

62
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:32,062
Oh.

63
00:04:32,772 --> 00:04:36,149
You wanna hear a freakish coincidence?

64
00:04:36,359 --> 00:04:38,193
Guess who's doing laundry there too?

65
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:40,362
- Who?
- Me.

66
00:04:41,155 --> 00:04:42,990
Was that not clear?

67
00:04:46,369 --> 00:04:47,661
Hey, why don't...?

68
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:50,998
Why don't I just
join you both there?

69
00:04:51,207 --> 00:04:53,667
Don't you have a laundry room
in your building?

70
00:04:55,336 --> 00:04:56,378
Yes.

71
00:04:57,714 --> 00:05:00,549
I do have a laundry room
in my building.

72
00:05:02,552 --> 00:05:05,262
Um... But there's a rat problem.

73
00:05:05,513 --> 00:05:08,724
Apparently, they're attracted to
the dryer sheets.

74
00:05:08,933 --> 00:05:11,810
They're going in fine,
but they're coming out all...

75

...fluffy.

76
00:05:16,649 --> 00:05:17,691
Anyway, 7-ish?

77
00:05:18,026 --> 00:05:19,067
Sure.

78
00:05:22,238 --> 00:05:24,323
Forget it, Joey.
I'm with Bob now.

79
00:05:24,532 --> 00:05:26,867
Bob? Who the hell's Bob?

80
00:05:27,118 --> 00:05:28,493
Bob is great.

He's smart, he's sophisticated,
and he has a real job.

You go on three auditions a month
and you call yourself an actor. But Bob...

83
00:05:36,252 --> 00:05:39,296
Come on. We were great together.

84
00:05:39,547 --> 00:05:43,925
And not just at the fun stuff,
but, like, talking too.

Sorry, Joey. You said,
"Let's just be friends."

- We're just friends.

Fine. Fine.

have dinner tonight? You know, as friends.

...and he has a real job.
