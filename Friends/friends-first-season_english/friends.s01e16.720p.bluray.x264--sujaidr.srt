[KNOCK ON DOOR]

316
00:18:37,074 --> 00:18:39,867
- Do you have a sec?
- Uh, sure, Nina. What's up?

317
00:18:40,452 --> 00:18:43,663
I don't know. For the past couple days,
people have been avoiding me...

318
00:18:43,872 --> 00:18:45,832
...and giving me
these really strange looks.

319
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:48,960
Oh, well, uh, maybe that's because...

320
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:52,255
...they're, uh, jealous of us.

321
00:18:52,631 --> 00:18:53,965
Maybe.

322
00:18:54,174 --> 00:18:57,343
But that doesn't explain why
they keep taking my scissors.

323
00:18:58,262 --> 00:19:02,098
Uh, well, maybe that's, uh,
because you're getting a big raise.

324
00:19:03,475 --> 00:19:05,560
- I am?
- Sure. Why not?

325
00:19:05,853 --> 00:19:08,813
Oh, my God. You're amazing.

326
00:19:09,398 --> 00:19:11,315
Oh, you don't know.

327
00:19:12,192 --> 00:19:15,611
Helen, make sure we put through the
paperwork on Miss Bookbinder's raise.

328
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:19,907
HELEN [OVER INTERCOM]: Still want her
psychological profile sent to personnel?

329
00:19:20,075 --> 00:19:22,994
- What?
- Helen drinks.

330
00:19:23,704 --> 00:19:25,496
Will you marry me?

331
00:19:32,087 --> 00:19:34,922
- Well, I ended up telling her everything.
- Ooh. How'd she take it?

332
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:38,217
Pretty well.
Except for the stapler thing.

333
00:19:38,635 --> 00:19:41,721
Little tip. If you're ever
in a similar situation...

334
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:44,682
...never, ever leave
your hand on the desk.

335
00:19:45,893 --> 00:19:48,853
Okay, I think I get how to do this.

336
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:51,522
[SPEAKING IN SPANISH]

337
00:19:54,151 --> 00:19:56,777
Can we turn this off?
Can we make them go away?

338
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:58,863
Because I can't watch.

339
00:19:59,239 --> 00:20:00,948
- Okay, Pheebs, they're gone.
- Okay.

340
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:03,409
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

341
00:20:03,619 --> 00:20:07,538
It's just, you know,
this whole stupid Ursula thing.

342
00:20:07,915 --> 00:20:09,332
Okay, Pheebs, can I ask?

343
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:12,835
So he's going out with her.
Is it really so terrible?

344
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:14,420
Um, yeah.

345
00:20:16,173 --> 00:20:19,342
I mean, I'm not saying
she's evil or anything.

346
00:20:19,593 --> 00:20:22,428
She's just, you know,
always breaking my stuff.

347
00:20:23,347 --> 00:20:26,641
When I was 8, I wouldn't let her
have my Judy Jetson Thermos...

348
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:28,893
...so she threw it under the bus.

349
00:20:29,811 --> 00:20:31,604
And then there's Randy Brown...

350
00:20:31,813 --> 00:20:33,272
...who was like...

351
00:20:33,732 --> 00:20:36,651
Have you ever had a boyfriend
who was like your best friend?

352
00:20:37,611 --> 00:20:38,861
- No.
- No.

353
00:20:40,614 --> 00:20:42,907
Well, but that's what he was for me.

354
00:20:43,116 --> 00:20:45,618
And she, you know,
kind of stole him away...

355
00:20:45,869 --> 00:20:48,704
...and then broke his heart.

356
00:20:49,539 --> 00:20:52,166
And then he wouldn't
even talk to me anymore.

357
00:20:52,417 --> 00:20:56,671
He didn't want to be around anything
that looked like either one of us.

358
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:00,174
Oh, Pheebs.

359
00:21:00,592 --> 00:21:04,762
I mean, I know Joey's not
my boyfriend or my Thermos...

360
00:21:05,847 --> 00:21:07,265
...or anything, but...

361
00:21:07,516 --> 00:21:10,268
- You won't lose him.
- You gotta talk to Joey.

362
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:11,811
Yeah, okay.

363
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:15,147
Come on. He doesn't know this stuff.
If he knew how you felt...

364
00:21:15,357 --> 00:21:16,983
He's falling in love with her.

365
00:21:17,192 --> 00:21:19,193
Oh, please.
They've been going out a week.

366
00:21:19,444 --> 00:21:23,739
They haven't even slept together yet.
I mean, that's not serious.

367
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,244
Okay.

368
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,706
Oh. Okay. Oh.

369
00:21:47,931 --> 00:21:48,973
Oh.

370
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:52,727
Yeah, um, may we help you?

371
00:22:07,451 --> 00:22:10,786
Rachel, what are you doing? It's freezing.
Would you come inside?

372
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:12,830
No, no, no.

373
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:15,750
You wanted me to take them down...

374
00:22:15,959 --> 00:22:18,544
...so I'm taking them down, okay?

375
00:22:19,296 --> 00:22:20,421
[RACHEL YELLS]

376
00:22:20,589 --> 00:22:23,257
Rachel!

377
00:22:23,425 --> 00:22:25,551
I'm okay. I'm okay.

378
00:22:26,678 --> 00:22:27,928
Mr. Heckles?

379
00:22:28,847 --> 00:22:31,599
Mr. Heckles,
could you help me, please?

380
00:22:32,768 --> 00:22:35,978
See, this is just the kind of thing
I was talking about.
