00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:31,878
I mean, come on, buddy!
Get a real car!

313
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:38,593
Rachel, come on. Give us a chance.

314
00:19:39,344 --> 00:19:41,220
- Ross, it's too hard.
- No, no.

315
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:43,347
Because it'll get weird
for everyone else?

316
00:19:43,557 --> 00:19:45,725
Who cares about them? This is about us.

317
00:19:45,934 --> 00:19:49,437
I've been in love with you
since the ninth grade.

318
00:19:49,646 --> 00:19:52,190
- You're, like, my best friend.
- I know.

319
00:19:52,399 --> 00:19:54,358
- If we broke up, and I lost you...
- Whoa.

320
00:19:54,568 --> 00:19:56,402
Why do you think we'll break up?

321
00:19:56,612 --> 00:20:00,489
Have you been involved with someone
where you haven't broken up?

322
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:04,702
No.

323
00:20:04,912 --> 00:20:08,623
But it only has to happen once.

324
00:20:08,957 --> 00:20:12,001
You and I know
we are perfect for each other.

325
00:20:12,294 --> 00:20:13,419
Right?

326
00:20:13,629 --> 00:20:17,298
So the only question is:
Are you attracted to me?

327
00:20:19,384 --> 00:20:21,219
I don't know.

328
00:20:22,846 --> 00:20:25,765
I mean, I've never looked at you
that way before.

329
00:20:26,683 --> 00:20:28,142
Well start looking.

330
00:20:38,612 --> 00:20:39,654
Wow.

331
00:20:39,863 --> 00:20:41,072
Exactly!

332
00:20:41,281 --> 00:20:43,199
And you just know
I'm gonna be the guy...

333
00:20:43,408 --> 00:20:46,369
...caught behind this hammerhead
in traffic!

334
00:20:48,997 --> 00:20:50,206
- Right.
- Heh.

335
00:20:50,415 --> 00:20:52,083
You're right.

336
00:20:52,459 --> 00:20:53,542
- You know what?
- What?

337
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:57,046
I forgot, I'm supposed to pick up
a friend at the airport.

338
00:20:57,256 --> 00:20:59,382
I am so sorry. I'm so...

339
00:20:59,591 --> 00:21:02,969
If you want to stay
and finish your drinks, please do.

340
00:21:03,178 --> 00:21:05,596
I'm sorry, I gotta go. I'm sorry.

341
00:21:05,806 --> 00:21:07,515
But...

342
00:21:16,984 --> 00:21:18,943
Excuse me! Pardon me! Excuse me.

343
00:21:19,152 --> 00:21:20,778
I'm sorry. Ha, ha.

344
00:21:20,988 --> 00:21:23,823
Toby, for God's sake, will you let it go?

345
00:21:24,032 --> 00:21:25,783
There's no Rachel!

346
00:21:30,622 --> 00:21:33,791
- Oh, hey. I got that.
- Oh.

347
00:21:34,001 --> 00:21:36,502
- Thanks, sweetie.
- No problem.

348
00:21:42,342 --> 00:21:44,760
I cannot wait
for you to meet my friends.

349
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:47,513
Really? You don't think
they'll judge and ridicule me?

350
00:21:47,723 --> 00:21:49,515
No, they will. I just, uh...

351
00:21:49,725 --> 00:21:51,017
- Can't wait. Heh.
- Can't wait.

352
00:21:51,226 --> 00:21:52,768
Come on, they're gonna love you.
