Right? I mean, this woman was...

319
00:17:46,356 --> 00:17:47,982
...unbelievably sexy...

320
00:17:48,233 --> 00:17:51,569
...and beautiful,
intelligent, unattainable...

321
00:17:53,781 --> 00:17:55,782
Tell me why you did this again?

322
00:17:56,867 --> 00:17:57,950
ROSS: Hey!
MONICA: Hey!

323
00:17:58,202 --> 00:17:59,619
RACHEL:
Movie star!

324
00:17:59,828 --> 00:18:03,498
Aren't you the guy who plays
the butt in the new Al Pacino movie?

325
00:18:05,667 --> 00:18:06,709
Nope.

326
00:18:07,127 --> 00:18:09,545
No? What happened, big guy?

327
00:18:09,797 --> 00:18:11,214
Big guy?

328
00:18:13,383 --> 00:18:15,593
It felt like a "big guy" moment.

329
00:18:16,553 --> 00:18:17,595
I got fired!

330
00:18:18,847 --> 00:18:20,765
They said I acted too much with it.

331
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:25,436
I told everybody about this.

332
00:18:25,646 --> 00:18:27,605
Everybody will be
expecting to see me.

333
00:18:27,856 --> 00:18:30,399
You know what?
No one will be able to tell.

334
00:18:30,692 --> 00:18:32,276
My mom will.

335
00:18:34,196 --> 00:18:36,280
There's something so sweet...

336
00:18:36,532 --> 00:18:38,741
...and disturbing about that.

337
00:18:40,035 --> 00:18:42,954
I've done nothing
but crappy plays for six years...

338
00:18:43,205 --> 00:18:46,207
...and I finally get my shot,
and I blow it!

339
00:18:46,416 --> 00:18:48,167
Maybe this wasn't your shot.

340
00:18:48,377 --> 00:18:52,922
I think when it's your shot,
you know it's your shot.

341
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:56,050
Did it feel like your shot?

342
00:18:57,469 --> 00:19:00,054
Hard to tell. I was naked.

343
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:01,889
I don't think this was your shot.

344
00:19:02,099 --> 00:19:04,392
I don't even think
you just get one shot.

345
00:19:04,601 --> 00:19:07,979
I really believe big things are
gonna happen for you. I do.

346
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:12,108
You've gotta keep thinking about
the day that some kid will go...

347
00:19:12,317 --> 00:19:15,987
..."I got the part! I'm gonna be
Joey Tribbiani's ass!"

348
00:19:19,283 --> 00:19:21,909
You think? That's so nice.

349
00:19:23,287 --> 00:19:24,704
Oh, come here.

350
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:30,835
I'm sorry, Joey.
I'm gonna go to bed, guys.

351
00:19:31,086 --> 00:19:32,128
ROSS:
Good night.

352
00:19:32,504 --> 00:19:34,714
RACHEL: You're gonna leave
your shoes out here?

353
00:19:36,925 --> 00:19:38,342
Uh-huh.

354
00:19:39,887 --> 00:19:43,181
Really? Just casually
strewn about...

355
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:45,683
...in that reckless,
haphazard manner?

356
00:19:47,603 --> 00:19:51,314
It doesn't matter.
I'll get them tomorrow. Or not!

357
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:54,233
Whenever.

358
00:19:56,904 --> 00:19:59,655
She is a kook.

359
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:09,290
[HUMMING]

360
00:20:13,378 --> 00:20:17,465
MONICA [THINKING]: If it bothers you
that much, just go out and get the shoes.

361
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:21,636
No, don't do this!

362
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:23,304
This is stupid!

363
00:20:23,555 --> 00:20:26,641
I don't have to prove anything.
I'm gonna go get them.

364
00:20:27,434 --> 00:20:29,185
But then everyone will know.

365
00:20:30,687 --> 00:20:34,982
Unless I get them, and then wake up
really early and put them back.

366
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:36,943
I need help!
