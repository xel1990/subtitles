- Absolutely.
- Yeah, I think, for us...

...kissing is pretty much
like an opening act.

...after the concert's over,
no matter how great the show was...

16

...you girls are always looking
for the comedian again.

Even when you were a kid,
and you were chubby...

...and you had no friends,
you were just fine.

...what exactly happened
between Carol and me.

are going to raise the baby.

you can't change your parents.

- Oh, yeah. We don't speak.

- She's a waitress.

Helen Willick Bunch.

318
00:19:50,147 --> 00:19:52,773
Well, wait a minute.
Why is she in the title?

319
00:19:52,983 --> 00:19:54,358
Because it's my baby too.

320
00:19:54,568 --> 00:19:57,862
That's funny. Really? I don't remember
you making any sperm.

321
00:20:00,574 --> 00:20:03,159
And we all know what
a challenge that is.

322
00:20:03,368 --> 00:20:05,203
- Uh-huh. See?
- All right, you two, stop it.

323
00:20:05,412 --> 00:20:07,747
No, no. She gets a credit.
Hey, I'm in there too.

324
00:20:07,956 --> 00:20:11,918
Honestly. You're not actually suggesting
Helen Willick Bunch Geller.

325
00:20:12,127 --> 00:20:13,711
I think that borders on child abuse.

326
00:20:13,921 --> 00:20:17,715
Of course not.
I'm suggesting Geller Willick Bunch.

327
00:20:17,925 --> 00:20:20,384
Oh, no. No, no, no.
You see what he's doing?

328
00:20:20,594 --> 00:20:22,428
He knows no one
is gonna say all those names.

329
00:20:22,638 --> 00:20:25,264
He knows they'll wind up calling her Geller.
Then he gets his way.

330
00:20:25,474 --> 00:20:27,683
My way? You think this is my way?

331
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:31,437
Believe me, of all the ways I ever imagined
this moment in my life being...

332
00:20:31,647 --> 00:20:34,857
...this is not my way. You know what?
This is too hard.

333
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:38,069
Knock, knock.
How are we today? Any nausea?

334
00:20:38,278 --> 00:20:40,154
- A little.
- Just a little.

335
00:20:41,949 --> 00:20:46,577
Well, I was just wondering about the
mother-to-be, but, uh, thanks for sharing.

336
00:20:46,787 --> 00:20:47,870
Uh, lie back.

337
00:20:48,664 --> 00:20:50,289
You know what? I'm gonna go.

338
00:20:50,499 --> 00:20:54,502
Um, I don't think I can be involved
in this particular family thing.

339
00:20:54,711 --> 00:20:56,754
[BABY'S HEART BEATING
OVER SONOGRAM]

340
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:07,348
Oh, my God.

341
00:21:07,557 --> 00:21:08,641
Look at that.

342
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:10,309
I know.

343
00:21:21,071 --> 00:21:23,364
Well, isn't that amazing?

344
00:21:26,785 --> 00:21:28,494
What are we supposed
to be seeing here?

345
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:34,208
I don't know, but I think it's about
to attack the Enterprise.

346
00:21:38,255 --> 00:21:41,173
You know, if you tilt your head
to the left and relax your eyes...

347
00:21:41,383 --> 00:21:43,634
...it kind of looks like an old potato.

348
00:21:44,761 --> 00:21:47,054
Then don't do that, all right?

349
00:21:49,224 --> 00:21:50,474
Monica?

350
00:21:50,684 --> 00:21:52,226
What do you think?

351
00:21:52,436 --> 00:21:53,894
Mm-hm.

352
00:21:55,063 --> 00:21:56,522
Are you welling up?

353
00:21:56,732 --> 00:21:57,982
- No.
- You are.

354
00:21:58,191 --> 00:22:00,443
- You are. You're welling up.
- No, I'm not.

355
00:22:00,652 --> 00:22:03,779
- You're gonna be an aunt.
- Oh, shut up.

356
00:22:04,948 --> 00:22:06,407
Hi, Mindy.

357
00:22:06,616 --> 00:22:08,701
Hi, it's Rachel.

358
00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:12,705
Yeah, I'm fine. I saw Barry today.

359
00:22:12,914 --> 00:22:14,582
Oh, yeah, yeah, he told me.

360
00:22:14,791 --> 00:22:17,501
No, it's okay. Really, it's okay.

361
00:22:17,711 --> 00:22:21,380
I hope you two are very happy.
I really do.

362
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:24,759
And, Min, you know,
if everything works out...

363
00:22:24,968 --> 00:22:29,096
...and you guys end up getting
married and having kids and everything...

364
00:22:29,306 --> 00:22:32,683
...I just hope they have his
old hairline and your old nose.

365
00:22:37,731 --> 00:22:40,983
Okay, I know it was a cheap shot,
but I feel so much better now.
