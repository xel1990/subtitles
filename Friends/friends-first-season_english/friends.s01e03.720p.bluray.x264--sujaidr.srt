156
00:09:38,327 --> 00:09:40,412
We're talking about someone
that I'm going out with?

157
00:09:40,621 --> 00:09:42,414
GROUP: Yes.
- And did you notice?

158
00:09:42,623 --> 00:09:43,957
GROUP:
Yeah.

159
00:09:48,504 --> 00:09:51,464
Know what was great?
The way his smile was kind of crooked.

160
00:09:51,674 --> 00:09:53,675
Yes, yes. Like the man in the shoe.

161
00:09:54,552 --> 00:09:55,677
What shoe?

162
00:09:57,096 --> 00:09:58,430
From the nursery rhyme.

163
00:09:58,639 --> 00:10:00,890
"There was a crooked man
who had a crooked smile...

164
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:03,727
...who lived in a shoe for a while..."

165
00:10:06,814 --> 00:10:09,024
So I think Alan...

166
00:10:09,233 --> 00:10:10,442
...will become the yardstick...

167
00:10:10,651 --> 00:10:13,403
...against which all future boyfriends
will be measured.

168
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:14,779
What future boyfriends?

169
00:10:14,989 --> 00:10:17,532
No, no. I think this could be,
you know, "it."

170
00:10:17,742 --> 00:10:18,825
- Really?
- Oh, yeah.

171
00:10:19,035 --> 00:10:22,495
I'd marry him just for his
David Hasselhoff impression alone.

172
00:10:22,705 --> 00:10:25,332
You know I'm gonna be doing that
at parties, right?

173
00:10:29,128 --> 00:10:31,630
- You know what I like most about him?
- What?

174
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:35,675
The way he makes me feel about myself.

175
00:10:38,512 --> 00:10:40,055
ALL:
Yeah.

176
00:10:53,277 --> 00:10:54,861
Hi.

177
00:10:57,198 --> 00:10:58,365
How was the game?

178
00:10:59,742 --> 00:11:01,117
Well...

179
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:03,870
- We won!
- We won! Thank you! Yeah.

180
00:11:04,705 --> 00:11:07,624
Fantastic. I have one question:
How is that possible?

181
00:11:08,709 --> 00:11:11,002
- Alan.
- He was unbelievable.

182
00:11:11,212 --> 00:11:14,756
He was like that Bugs Bunny cartoon
where Bugs is playing all the positions.

183
00:11:14,965 --> 00:11:18,426
But instead of Bugs, it was first base, Alan.
Second base, Alan...

184
00:11:22,056 --> 00:11:25,475
I mean, it was like he made us
into a team.

185
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:27,686
Yep. We sure showed
those Hasidic jewelers...

186
00:11:27,895 --> 00:11:30,522
...a thing or two about softball.
- Nice.

187
00:11:31,857 --> 00:11:33,441
Can I ask you guys a question?

188
00:11:33,651 --> 00:11:36,111
Do you ever think that Alan
is maybe sometimes...

189
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:40,281
- What?
- I don't know. A little too Alan?

190
00:11:40,491 --> 00:11:43,910
Oh, no. That's not possible.
You can never be too Alan.

191
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:48,832
Yeah, it's his innate Alan-ness
that we adore.

192
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:51,376
- I, personally, could have a gallon of Alan.
- Oh!

193
00:11:57,383 --> 00:12:00,218
- Hey, Lizzy.
- Hey, Weird Girl.

194

- I brought you alphabet soup.
- Did you pick out the vowels?

195
00:12:03,347 --> 00:12:06,349
Yes, but I left in the Y's.
Because, you know, "Sometimes Y."

196
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:08,768
Um, I also have something else for you.

No, but would you like $1000
and a football phone?

Oh, I want you to have it. I don't want it.

No, no. I have to give you something.

No, it's fine. You don't...

Do you want my tinfoil hat?

No, because you need that.
No, it's okay. Thanks.

Hey, this is so unfair.

- Why is it unfair?
- So I have a flaw. Big deal.

Oh, man, there's really
no easy way to say this. Uh...

312
00:19:48,395 --> 00:19:50,813
I've decided to break up with Alan.

313
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,361
Is there somebody else?

314
00:19:59,781 --> 00:20:01,741
No, no, no. It's just...

315
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:04,952
...you know, things change.
People change.

316
00:20:05,329 --> 00:20:07,205
We didn't change.

317
00:20:09,791 --> 00:20:11,709
So that's it? It's over?

318
00:20:13,337 --> 00:20:14,712
Just like that?

319
00:20:15,797 --> 00:20:17,548
You know, you let your guard down.

320
00:20:17,758 --> 00:20:20,843
You know, you start to really care
about someone, and I just...

321
00:20:24,348 --> 00:20:26,933
- Look, I could go on pretending...
- Okay.

322
00:20:27,142 --> 00:20:29,393
No. No, that wouldn't be fair to me...

323
00:20:29,603 --> 00:20:31,395
...it wouldn't be fair to Alan,
or to you.

324
00:20:31,688 --> 00:20:33,689
Yeah, well, who wants fair?

325
00:20:33,899 --> 00:20:37,777
I mean, I just want things back,
you know, the way they were.

326
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:43,908
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, she's sorry. I feel better.

327
00:20:45,661 --> 00:20:47,078
I just can't believe this.

328
00:20:47,287 --> 00:20:51,958
I mean, with the holidays coming up.
I wanted him to meet my family.

329
00:20:53,126 --> 00:20:56,170
I'll meet someone else.
There'll be other Alans.

330
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:57,546
Yeah, right.

331
00:21:02,427 --> 00:21:05,972
- Are you guys gonna be okay?
- Hey, hey. We'll be fine.

332
00:21:06,181 --> 00:21:08,808
We're just gonna need a little time.

333
00:21:09,726 --> 00:21:11,310
I understand.

334
00:21:16,441 --> 00:21:17,858
Wow.

335
00:21:18,068 --> 00:21:21,988
- I'm really sorry.
- Yeah. I mean, I'm sorry too.

336
00:21:22,614 --> 00:21:24,782
But I gotta tell you, I'm a little relieved.

337
00:21:24,992 --> 00:21:26,867
- Relieved?
- Yeah, well...

338
00:21:27,077 --> 00:21:29,412
...I mean, I had a great time with you.

339
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,831
I just can't stand your friends.

340
00:21:39,172 --> 00:21:42,383
Remember when we went
to Central Park and rented boats?

341
00:21:44,428 --> 00:21:46,178
That was fun.

342
00:21:46,722 --> 00:21:50,266
Yeah. He could row like a Viking.

343
00:21:55,105 --> 00:21:57,106
- Hi.
GROUP: Hi.

344
00:21:59,067 --> 00:22:00,943
So how'd it go?

345
00:22:02,029 --> 00:22:04,947
- You know.
- Did he mention us?

346
00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:12,955
He says he's really gonna
miss you guys.

347
00:22:19,629 --> 00:22:20,838
ROSS:
You had a rough day, huh?

348
00:22:21,048 --> 00:22:23,841
- Oh, you have no idea.
ROSS: Come here.

349
00:22:27,471 --> 00:22:29,764
- That's it. I'm getting cigarettes.
GROUP: No, no, no.

350
00:22:29,973 --> 00:22:31,223
I don't care. I don't care.

351
00:22:31,433 --> 00:22:34,560
Game's over. I'm weak. I've gotta smoke.
I've gotta have the smoke.

352
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:37,355
If you never smoke again,
I'll give you $7000.

353
00:22:38,607 --> 00:22:40,024
Yeah, all right.
