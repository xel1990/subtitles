You can't stay here just because of me.

311
00:19:21,243 --> 00:19:24,829
Yes, I can. Because if I go,
it means I have to break up with you.

312
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:28,082
- And I can't break up with you.
- Oh, yes. Yes, you can.

313
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:32,670
Just say, uh, "Phoebe, I love you,
but my work is my life.

314
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:34,630
And that's what I have to do right now."

315
00:19:34,798 --> 00:19:37,717
And I say, "Your work? Your work?
How can you say that?"

316
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:42,013
And then you say, um,
"It's tearing me apart...

317
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:44,932
...but I have no choice.
Can't you understand that?"

318
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:49,061
And I say, "No.
No. I can't understand that."

319
00:19:49,229 --> 00:19:51,731
- Uh, ow.
- Sorry. Um...

320
00:19:52,691 --> 00:19:55,484
And then you put
your arms around me...

321
00:19:55,652 --> 00:19:59,071
- And then you put your arms around me.
- Oh, oh. Sorry.

322
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:03,659
And, um... And then you tell me you love me
and you'll never forget me.

323
00:20:04,703 --> 00:20:06,996
I'll never forget you.

324
00:20:08,457 --> 00:20:11,375
And then you say that it's almost midnight
and you have to go...

325
00:20:11,543 --> 00:20:16,047
...because you don't want to start
the new year with me if you can't finish it.

326
00:20:22,512 --> 00:20:24,222
I'm gonna miss you...

327
00:20:24,389 --> 00:20:26,265
...you scientist guy.

328
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,478
Hi, this is Dick Clark live
in Times Square.

329
00:20:30,646 --> 00:20:35,608
We're in a virtual snowstorm
of confetti here in Times Square.

330
00:20:35,776 --> 00:20:37,526
It gets bigger and better every year.

331
00:20:37,694 --> 00:20:39,528
Here you go, kids.

332
00:20:40,155 --> 00:20:43,491
And then the peacock bit me. Ha, ha.

333
00:20:43,659 --> 00:20:45,534
Please kiss me at midnight.

334
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:53,751
- You seen Sandy?
- Ooh. I don't know how to tell you this...

335
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:58,631
...but, uh, she's in Monica's bedroom
getting it on with Max, that scientist geek.

336
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:01,467
Oh, look at that.
I did know how to tell you.

337
00:21:02,302 --> 00:21:04,804

Hey, everybody, the ball is going.

338
00:21:04,972 --> 00:21:06,472
GROUP:
What?

339
00:21:06,974 --> 00:21:08,891
The ball is dropping.

340
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,896
CLARK [ON TV]:
In 20 seconds, it'll be midnight.

341
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:17,066
And the moment of joy is upon us.

342
00:21:17,484 --> 00:21:20,486
Looks like that "no-date pact" thing
worked out.

343
00:21:20,821 --> 00:21:23,281
Everybody looks so happy. I hate that.

344
00:21:23,448 --> 00:21:25,825
Not everybody is happy.
Hey, Bobby.

345
00:21:25,993 --> 00:21:28,536

346

GROUP:
One. Happy New Year!

347
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:36,836
You know, I just thought I'd throw this
out there. I'm no math whiz...

348
00:21:37,004 --> 00:21:41,674
...but I do believe there are three girls
and three guys right here.

349
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:46,053
Oh, I don't feel like kissing
anyone tonight.

350
00:21:46,221 --> 00:21:48,389
I can't kiss anyone.

351
00:21:48,557 --> 00:21:50,349
So I'm kissing everyone?

352
00:21:51,101 --> 00:21:53,269
No, no, no. You can't kiss Ross.
That's your brother.

353
00:21:54,271 --> 00:21:57,064
Perfect. Perfect. So now everybody's
getting kissed but me.

354
00:21:57,232 --> 00:21:58,607
All right. Somebody kiss me.

355
00:21:58,775 --> 00:22:02,611
Somebody kiss me. It's midnight.
Somebody kiss me. It's midnight.

356
00:22:02,779 --> 00:22:04,864
All right. All right. All right.

357
00:22:05,032 --> 00:22:06,324
There.

358
00:22:13,457 --> 00:22:16,375
I wanted this to work so much.

359
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:18,502
I'm still in there, you know?

360
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:21,922
Changing his diapers.
Picking his fleas.

361
00:22:22,257 --> 00:22:25,009
But he's just phoning it in.

362
00:22:26,053 --> 00:22:28,763
It's just so hard to accept
that something you love so much...

363
00:22:28,930 --> 00:22:31,307
...doesn't love you back, you know?

364
00:22:31,892 --> 00:22:34,810
I think that bitch cracked my tooth.
