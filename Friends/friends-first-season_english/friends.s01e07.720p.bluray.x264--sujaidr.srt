Oh.

320
00:20:01,825 --> 00:20:02,950

- Little.

323
00:20:13,003 --> 00:20:15,213
Do you know the word crap-weasel?

324
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:20,301
No? That's funny,
you are a huge crap-weasel.

325
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:29,227
Chandler, we've been here for an hour
doing this. Watch, it's easy.

- Ready?
- Mm-hm.

327

Okay? Now try it.

328
00:20:38,028 --> 00:20:39,695
You gotta whip it.

Look, look. The last candle's
about to burn out.

Ten, nine, eight, seven...

minus 48...

MONICA: Thanks.

Kind of spooky without any lights.

Uh, Ross...

This probably isn't the best time
to bring it up...

341
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:34,333
...but you have to throw
a party for Monica.

- Yes.

Yes. Thanks for, uh, letting me
use your phone...

Hi. Um, I'm account number 7143457.
And I don't know if you got any of that...

like a copy of the tape.
