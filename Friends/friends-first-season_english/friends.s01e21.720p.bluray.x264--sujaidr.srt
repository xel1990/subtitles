1
00:00:02,836 --> 00:00:05,045
How'd someone get
your credit card number?

2
00:00:05,213 --> 00:00:07,673
I have no idea.
Look how much they spent!

3
00:00:07,841 --> 00:00:11,593
Calm down. You only have to pay
for the stuff you bought.

4
00:00:11,845 --> 00:00:14,513
Still, it's just such reckless spending.

5
00:00:14,723 --> 00:00:16,598
When somebody steals your credit card...

6
00:00:16,766 --> 00:00:19,810
...they've kind of already
thrown caution to the wind.

7
00:00:23,064 --> 00:00:28,068
Wow, what a geek.
They spent $69.95 on a Wonder Mop.

8
00:00:29,529 --> 00:00:31,155
That's me.

9
00:00:33,408 --> 00:00:35,117
Oh! Oh, the yuck.

10
00:00:36,369 --> 00:00:37,786
He's doing it again!

11
00:00:37,954 --> 00:00:40,247
Marcel, stop humping the lamp!

12
00:00:40,415 --> 00:00:42,791
Stop humping!
Now, Marcel, come back!

13
00:00:42,959 --> 00:00:44,126
Come here, Marcel!

14
00:00:44,294 --> 00:00:46,503
Oh, no, no! Not in my room!
I'll get him.

15
00:00:46,671 --> 00:00:49,673
You've got to do something
about the humping.

16
00:00:49,841 --> 00:00:52,092
What? It's just a phase.

17
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:55,095
Well, that's what we said about Joey.

18
00:00:57,265 --> 00:01:00,684
Hey, would you all relax?
It's not that big a deal.

19
00:01:00,894 --> 00:01:03,228
RACHEL:
Marcel, stop it! Marcel! Bad monkey!

20
00:01:03,396 --> 00:01:04,688
- What?
RACHEL: Ugh!

21
00:01:05,231 --> 00:01:08,650
Let's just say my Curious George doll
is no longer curious.

22
00:02:00,036 --> 00:02:03,705
Ugh, Monica, you are not still
going over that thing.

23
00:02:03,873 --> 00:02:06,708
- This woman's living my life.
- What?

24
00:02:07,168 --> 00:02:10,838
She's living my life,
and she's doing it better than me.

25
00:02:11,214 --> 00:02:13,257
Look at this. Look.

26
00:02:13,424 --> 00:02:16,093
She buys tickets to plays I want to see.

27
00:02:16,261 --> 00:02:19,596
She shops at stores that
I'm intimidated by the salespeople.

28
00:02:19,764 --> 00:02:22,349
She spent $300 on art supplies.

29
00:02:22,517 --> 00:02:23,892
You're not an artist.

30
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:27,062
Yeah, well, I might be
if I had the supplies.

31
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:32,192
I mean, I could do all this stuff.
Only I don't.

32
00:02:32,652 --> 00:02:35,112
Oh, Monica, come on.
You do cool things.

33
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,447
Oh, really? Let's compare, shall we?

34
00:02:37,615 --> 00:02:41,118
Oh, it's so late for "shall we?"

35
00:02:41,744 --> 00:02:44,121
Do I go horseback riding
in the park, hmm?

36
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:46,331
Do I take classes at The New School?

37
00:02:46,499 --> 00:02:48,500
- No.
- No.

38
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:50,377
This is so unfair.

39
00:02:50,545 --> 00:02:53,964
She's got everything I want,
and she doesn't have my mother.

40
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:04,558
How about Joey Paponi?

41
00:03:04,726 --> 00:03:08,937
No, still too ethnic. My agent thinks
I should have a name that's more neutral.

42
00:03:09,105 --> 00:03:10,939
Joey Switzerland?

43
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:20,199
Plus I think it should be Joe.
Joey makes me sound like I'm...

44
00:03:20,366 --> 00:03:21,617
...this big.

45
00:03:21,784 --> 00:03:22,993
Which I'm not!

46
00:03:25,538 --> 00:03:28,874
Joe, Joe, Joe... Stalin?

47
00:03:30,418 --> 00:03:32,294
Stalin.

48
00:03:33,171 --> 00:03:35,714
Do I know that name?
That sounds familiar.

49
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:39,426
- Well, it does not ring a bell with me.
- Huh.

50
00:03:39,594 --> 00:03:42,804
Joe Stalin.

51
00:03:45,016 --> 00:03:46,850
You know, that's pretty good.

52
00:03:47,518 --> 00:03:49,561
- You might want to try Joseph.
- Ah!

53
00:03:55,985 --> 00:03:58,528
Joseph Stalin!

54
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:01,323
- I think you'd remember that!
- Oh, yes!

55
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:05,702
Bye Bye Birdie, starring Joseph Stalin.

56
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:09,581
Joseph Stalin is the Fiddler on the Roof.

57
00:04:17,882 --> 00:04:19,091
- Hey.
- Hey.

58
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:20,592
Hi.

59
00:04:22,679 --> 00:04:24,846
Hi. Uh, yes, this is Monica Geller.

60
00:04:25,014 --> 00:04:29,351
Um, I'm taking classes with you,
and I was wondering what they were.

61
00:04:31,562 --> 00:04:33,146
What are you doing?

62
00:04:33,314 --> 00:04:34,648
All right, great.

63
00:04:34,857 --> 00:04:36,817
Great. Thanks a lot.

64
00:04:36,985 --> 00:04:38,819
I'm going to tap class.

65
00:04:38,987 --> 00:04:42,239
So you can dance with the woman
that stole your card?

66
00:04:42,407 --> 00:04:44,825
She's got my life.
I want to see who she is.

67
00:04:44,993 --> 00:04:47,369
Go to the post office!
I'm sure her picture's up!

68
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:51,248
Honey, you're kind of losing it here.

69
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:54,251
This is really becoming
a weird obsession.

70
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:56,253
This is madness, I tell you.

71
00:04:56,421 --> 00:04:58,547
For the love of God, Monica, don't do it!

72
00:05:02,176 --> 00:05:04,136
Thank you.

73
00:05:11,436 --> 00:05:13,103
What do you think?

74
00:05:13,271 --> 00:05:15,272
Lots of things.

75
00:05:16,232 --> 00:05:18,108
Which one do you think she is?

76
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:19,943
- May I help you?
- Oh, no, thanks.

77
00:05:20,111 --> 00:05:21,862
We're just here to observe.

78
00:05:22,071 --> 00:05:25,907
You don't observe a dance class.
You dance a dance class!

79
00:05:26,075 --> 00:05:27,409
Spare shoes are over there.

80
00:05:30,788 --> 00:05:32,039
What does she mean?

81
00:05:32,248 --> 00:05:34,082
I think she means, "You dance...

82
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:35,917
...a dance class!"

83
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:37,919
Come on, come on, come on!

84
00:05:38,129 --> 00:05:39,671
RACHEL:
Really?

85
00:05:40,089 --> 00:05:42,799
Hey, do you see anybody
you think could be me?

86
00:05:42,967 --> 00:05:47,596
People, last time there were yogurt containers
lying around after class.

87
00:05:47,764 --> 00:05:49,598
Let's not have that happen again!

88
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:52,142
She could be you.

89
00:05:56,773 --> 00:05:58,065
Let's get started.

90
00:05:58,649 --> 00:06:02,694
Five, six. Five, six, seven, eight.

91
00:06:07,408 --> 00:06:09,242
Okay, I'm not getting this!

92
00:06:09,452 --> 00:06:12,537
I'm totally getting it!

93
00:06:16,626 --> 00:06:20,420
Do you ever just feel like you're
so unbelievably uncoordinated?

94
00:06:28,262 --> 00:06:30,430
What? You just click when they click.

95
00:06:32,308 --> 00:06:34,810
All right.
Now everyone grab a partner.

96
00:06:34,977 --> 00:06:36,478
Oh! Oh.

97
00:06:36,646 --> 00:06:41,608
All right. And my dead mother
said you are it! I'm with Rachel.

98
00:06:42,026 --> 00:06:44,736
Great, it's gym class all over again.

99
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:46,405
RACHEL & PHOEBE:
Aww.

100
00:06:46,989 --> 00:06:50,784
That's all right. You can come up
to the front and dance with me.

101
00:06:51,452 --> 00:06:54,996
Why don't I just take off my clothes
and have a nightmare?

102
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:04,965
It's okay, it's okay!
I'm here, I'm here. I'm so sorry I'm late.

103
00:07:05,133 --> 00:07:06,383
Okay, here I am.

104
00:07:06,551 --> 00:07:09,052
So who's the new tense girl?

105
00:07:09,554 --> 00:07:10,762
She's your partner.

106
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:12,681
- Hi, I'm Monica.
- Hi.

107
00:07:14,142 --> 00:07:15,392
Oh, ha.

108
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,686
Monica.

109
00:07:18,312 --> 00:07:19,855
Hi, I'm Mon...

110
00:07:20,022 --> 00:07:21,064
Nana.

111
00:07:21,232 --> 00:07:23,567
- Monana?
- Yeah.

112
00:07:24,485 --> 00:07:25,610
It's Dutch.

113
00:07:25,778 --> 00:07:28,363
You're kidding.
I spent three years in Amsterdam.

114
00:07:28,531 --> 00:07:30,157
[SPEAKING IN DUTCH]

115
00:07:31,993 --> 00:07:35,162
Um, Pennsylvania Dutch.

116
00:07:36,247 --> 00:07:37,622
And we're dancing!

117
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:40,542
Five, six, seven, eight.

118
00:07:47,508 --> 00:07:48,925
Hi.

119
00:07:50,636 --> 00:07:52,345
- Hey.
- Hey.

120
00:07:52,513 --> 00:07:55,765
- Where have you been?
- I just got back from the vet.

121
00:07:55,975 --> 00:07:59,603
She's not gonna make you wear
a big plastic cone, is she?

122
00:08:02,648 --> 00:08:05,650
She says Marcel's humping thing
is not a phase.

123
00:08:05,818 --> 00:08:09,070
Apparently, he's reached sexual maturity.

124
00:08:09,906 --> 00:08:12,157
Hey, he beat you!

125
00:08:15,912 --> 00:08:20,916
She says, as time goes on,
he'll start getting aggressive and violent.

126
00:08:21,125 --> 00:08:22,584
What does this mean?

127
00:08:24,962 --> 00:08:26,421
I have to give him up.

128
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:46,650
I can't believe it. This sucks!

129
00:08:46,817 --> 00:08:50,320
You just got him.
How could he be an adult already?

130
00:08:50,488 --> 00:08:53,782
I know, I know.
One day he's this little thing...

131
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:56,451
...and before you know it,
he's this little thing...

132
00:08:56,619 --> 00:08:59,246
...I can't get off my leg.

133
00:09:00,665 --> 00:09:02,457
Isn't there any way you can keep him?

134
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:03,667
No. No.

135
00:09:03,834 --> 00:09:07,671
The vet said that unless he's in a place
where he has regular access...

136
00:09:07,838 --> 00:09:12,092
...to some monkey loving...

137
00:09:13,177 --> 00:09:15,136
...he's just gonna get vicious.

138
00:09:15,304 --> 00:09:18,181
I just gotta get him into a zoo.

139
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:22,852
- How do you get a monkey into a zoo?
- I know that one!

140
00:09:27,358 --> 00:09:30,277
No, that's popes into a Volkswagen.

141
00:09:31,862 --> 00:09:36,241
We're applying to a lot of them.
Our first choice would be a state zoo.

142
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:39,035
You know, like, uh, San Diego.

143
00:09:39,745 --> 00:09:41,371
Right?

144
00:09:41,539 --> 00:09:45,875
But that may just be a pipe dream
because he's out-of-state.

145
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:52,507
My vet knows someone at Miami,
so that's a possibility.

146
00:09:52,675 --> 00:09:56,177
But that's two blocks from the beach.
It's a total party zoo.

147
00:10:00,933 --> 00:10:02,017
- Hey.
CHANDLER: Hey.

148
00:10:02,184 --> 00:10:03,977
- Hi.
- We found the girl!

149
00:10:04,145 --> 00:10:05,770
- What?
- Did you call the cops?

150
00:10:05,938 --> 00:10:07,522
Nope. We took her to lunch.

151
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:10,400
Ah. Your own brand of vigilante justice.

152
00:10:12,194 --> 00:10:14,738
Are you insane?
This woman stole from you!

153
00:10:14,905 --> 00:10:17,490
She stole! She's a stealer!

154
00:10:18,242 --> 00:10:21,369
After you're with this woman
for 10 minutes, you forget all that.

155
00:10:23,414 --> 00:10:25,874
I mean, she's this astounding person...

156
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:28,251
...with this amazing spirit!

157
00:10:28,419 --> 00:10:31,546
Yeah, which she probably stole
from some cheerleader!

158
00:10:33,883 --> 00:10:36,217
- Take off their hats.
- Popes in a Volkswagen!

159
00:10:36,385 --> 00:10:37,677

stand in front of a tap class.

where the kid...

...kills himself because
he can't be in the play?

What was that?

191
00:12:22,158 --> 00:12:26,786
It's like, "Kid, wait a year.
Leave home, do some community theater!"

192
00:12:28,956 --> 00:12:30,790
I walked out of there, and I thought:

00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:35,378
"Now, that's two hours of my life
that I'm never getting back!"

00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:39,257
And that scared me more than
all the other crap I was afraid to do.

00:20:32,731 --> 00:20:36,025
Just say what you feel, Joey.

319
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:38,819
Marcel, I'm hungry.

320
00:20:39,821 --> 00:20:40,863
ROSS:
That was good.

321
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:46,452
- Marcel, this is for you.
- Oh.

322
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:50,498
It's, uh, just, you know,
something to, um...

323
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:53,376
...do on the plane.

324
00:20:55,963 --> 00:20:59,215
If you don't mind,
I'd like a moment, just me and him.

325
00:20:59,383 --> 00:21:02,385
- Sure.
- Of course. Absolutely.

326
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:05,263
ALL:
Oh.

327
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:09,976
Marcel, come here. Come here.

328
00:21:10,143 --> 00:21:11,852
Come here.

329
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:13,646
Well, buddy...

330
00:21:15,649 --> 00:21:17,066
...this is it.

331
00:21:17,234 --> 00:21:20,361
There's just a couple of things
I wanted to say.

332
00:21:21,822 --> 00:21:24,365
I'm really gonna miss you.

333
00:21:24,533 --> 00:21:27,451
You know? And I'm never gonna
forget about you.

334
00:21:27,619 --> 00:21:32,498
You've been more than just a pet to me.

335
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:34,292
You've been more like a...

336
00:21:34,459 --> 00:21:36,585
Okay. Marcel, would you...?

337
00:21:37,379 --> 00:21:39,630
Marcel, would you leave my leg alone?

338
00:21:39,798 --> 00:21:43,426
Would you just stop humping me
for two seconds? Marc... Would you...?

339
00:21:43,593 --> 00:21:47,430
Okay, would you just take him away?
Just take him.

340
00:22:09,369 --> 00:22:13,164
O! That I were a glove
upon that hand...

341
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:17,043
...that I might touch thy cheek.

342
00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:19,879
WOMAN:
That's fine. Thank you.

343
00:22:20,047 --> 00:22:21,839
MAN:
Next.

344
00:22:25,552 --> 00:22:28,346
Hi. Uh, I'll be reading
for the role of Mercutio.

345
00:22:28,513 --> 00:22:31,474
MAN: Name?
- Holden McGroin.
