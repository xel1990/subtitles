It's because I wanted
to go out with her too.

Let me see.

322
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:12,353
No, no. That would be me again.

323
00:21:17,234 --> 00:21:19,568
I'm, uh, just trying something.

324
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:32,748
- Hey, Lowell.
- Oh, hey, Chandler.

325
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,420
So how's it going in
Financial Services?

326
00:21:37,671 --> 00:21:40,965
It's like Mardi Gras without
the papier-mâché heads.

327
00:21:41,216 --> 00:21:42,300
How about you?

328
00:21:42,509 --> 00:21:46,178
Good. Good. Listen, um, heh...

329
00:21:46,346 --> 00:21:49,473
...I don't know what Shelly told you
about me, but, uh...

330
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:51,976
...I'm not.

331
00:21:53,103 --> 00:21:55,313
I know. That's what I told her.

332
00:21:55,814 --> 00:21:56,981
- Really?
- Yeah.

333
00:21:58,317 --> 00:22:00,067
So you can tell?

334
00:22:01,945 --> 00:22:06,324
Pretty much. Most of the time.
We have a kind of radar.

335
00:22:08,285 --> 00:22:10,036
So you don't think I have...

336
00:22:10,203 --> 00:22:11,245
...a quality?

337
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:16,083
Speaking for my people,
I'd have to say no.

338
00:22:18,628 --> 00:22:21,881
By the way, your friend Brian
from Payroll? He is.

339
00:22:22,466 --> 00:22:23,507
- He is?
- Yep.

340
00:22:23,717 --> 00:22:25,634
And way out of your league.

341
00:22:29,389 --> 00:22:30,973
Out of my league.

342
00:22:31,224 --> 00:22:35,353
I could get a Brian. If I wanted to
get a Brian, I could get a Brian.

343
00:22:35,729 --> 00:22:37,438
Hey, Brian.
