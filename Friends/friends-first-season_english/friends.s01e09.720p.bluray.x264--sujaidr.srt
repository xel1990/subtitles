00:19:14,236 --> 00:19:16,112
Oh, God, this is great.

311
00:19:16,321 --> 00:19:19,699
The plane is gone,
so I guess I'm stuck here with you guys.

312
00:19:19,867 --> 00:19:23,619
Hey, we all had better plans, okay?
This was nobody's first choice.

313
00:19:23,787 --> 00:19:25,204
Oh, really?

314
00:19:25,372 --> 00:19:26,914
So why was I busting my ass...

315
00:19:27,082 --> 00:19:29,417
...to make this delicious
Thanksgiving dinner?!

316
00:19:29,585 --> 00:19:32,044
- You call that delicious?
- You be quiet!

317
00:19:32,212 --> 00:19:34,088
[ALL SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY]

318
00:19:34,256 --> 00:19:36,007
All right, stop it, stop it, stop it!

319
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:39,010
Now, this feels like Thanksgiving.

320
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:55,401
PHOEBE: Ew.
- What?

321
00:19:55,569 --> 00:19:59,071
PHOEBE: Ugly Naked Guy's
taking his turkey out of the oven.

322
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:01,782
JOEY, ROSS & MONICA:
Eh.

323
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:04,869
PHOEBE:
Oh, my God. He's not alone.

324
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:06,245
Ugly Naked Guy...

325
00:20:06,413 --> 00:20:09,582
...is having Thanksgiving dinner
with Ugly Naked Gal.

326
00:20:11,251 --> 00:20:13,461
JOEY:
I gotta see this.

327
00:20:14,546 --> 00:20:16,172
ALL:
Aw.

328
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:18,382
All right, Ugly Naked Guy.

329
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:21,969
Ooh, ugly naked dancing.

330
00:20:22,137 --> 00:20:24,680
It's nice that he has someone.

331
00:20:35,817 --> 00:20:37,526
Shall I carve?

332
00:20:37,694 --> 00:20:38,778
By all means.

333
00:20:39,363 --> 00:20:40,947
CHANDLER:
All right.

334
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:48,579
Okay, who wants light cheese
and who wants dark cheese?

335
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:52,500
I don't even wanna know
about the dark cheese.

336
00:20:52,668 --> 00:20:55,294
- Does anybody wanna split this with me?
- Ooh, I will.

337
00:20:55,462 --> 00:20:56,921
Mm. You guys have to make a wish.

338
00:20:57,923 --> 00:21:01,926
- Make a wish?
- Come on, you know, Thanksgiving.

339
00:21:05,847 --> 00:21:09,433
Ooh. You got the bigger half.
What did you wish for?

340
00:21:09,601 --> 00:21:11,602
The bigger half.

341
00:21:13,563 --> 00:21:16,148
All right, I'd like to propose a toast.

342
00:21:16,316 --> 00:21:18,776
- A little toast here. Ding, ding, ding.
ALL: Mm.

343
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:21,904
This isn't exactly
the kind of Thanksgiving you planned...

344
00:21:22,072 --> 00:21:25,866
...but for me this has been really great,
you know?

345
00:21:26,034 --> 00:21:28,786
I think because it didn't involve divorce...

346
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:30,788
...or projectile vomiting.

347
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:35,793
I was just thinking,
if you'd gone to Vail...

348
00:21:35,961 --> 00:21:39,880
...or if you guys had been with your family,
or if you didn't have...

349
00:21:40,048 --> 00:21:41,590
...syphilis and stuff...

350
00:21:44,219 --> 00:21:46,137
...we wouldn't be all together, you know?

351
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:47,972
So I guess what I'm trying to say...

352
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:54,020
...is that I'm very thankful
that all of your Thanksgivings sucked.

353
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:56,480
RACHEL & JOEY:
That's so sweet.

354
00:21:56,648 --> 00:21:58,649
RACHEL:
Thank you.

355
00:21:58,817 --> 00:22:00,318
ROSS:
Mm.

356
00:22:00,485 --> 00:22:02,611
And hey, here's to a lousy Christmas.

357
00:22:02,779 --> 00:22:04,071
And a crappy New Year.

358
00:22:04,239 --> 00:22:06,532
ALL:
Hear, hear.
