1
00:00:00,917 --> 00:00:02,168
Why do you glance over?

2
00:00:03,085 --> 00:00:04,128
Ah...

3
00:00:04,128 --> 00:00:06,756
It’s not because a woman is smoking, but...

4
00:00:06,964 --> 00:00:07,840
Yes.

5
00:00:09,008 --> 00:00:09,592
but it,t.... [stuttering]

6
00:00:11,344 --> 00:00:13,471
Can I get a drink of water?

7
00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:17,468
20 people were recruited to be blind date participants

8
00:00:17,503 --> 00:00:19,297
One-sided Blind Date

9
00:00:25,232 --> 00:00:27,318
I chose participant 5

10
00:00:27,443 --> 00:00:31,906
 I usually like individuals who are gentle

11
00:00:32,073 --> 00:00:35,993
and she seems to give off that vibe

12
00:00:47,254 --> 00:00:48,839
- Hello
- Hello

13
00:00:51,384 --> 00:00:54,345
I thought you’d be the type to be calm and gentle

14
00:00:54,345 --> 00:00:55,721
so I chose you

15
00:00:55,721 --> 00:00:58,265
You like that type of person, huh

16
00:00:58,766 --> 00:01:01,018
Male
Answers the given question

17
00:01:01,018 --> 00:01:03,479
Female
Chooses the option they want

18
00:01:04,438 --> 00:01:06,816
-Inclination-

19
00:01:09,819 --> 00:01:10,444
“Cellphone”

20
00:01:10,444 --> 00:01:16,075
“Cellphone”
iPhone vs Galaxy

21
00:01:16,075 --> 00:01:17,618
I picked iPhone

22
00:01:20,871 --> 00:01:23,332
Why did you choose iPhone?

23
00:01:23,332 --> 00:01:25,584
I’m also currently using an iPhone and personally,

24
00:01:25,584 --> 00:01:30,256
I like the distinct vibe it has

25
00:01:30,256 --> 00:01:33,217
 I would like the guy I’m dating to also be using an iPhone

26
00:01:33,217 --> 00:01:35,511
and enjoying taking photos 

27
00:01:35,511 --> 00:01:36,637
Since it’s easy to share

28
00:01:36,637 --> 00:01:40,182
Yeah, since I like its vibes

29
00:01:40,391 --> 00:01:42,476
I feel the same way

30
00:01:45,896 --> 00:01:46,689
“Social issues on social media”

31
00:01:46,689 --> 00:01:51,193
“Social issues on social media”
Tend to post about them vs Tend not to post about them

32
00:01:51,193 --> 00:01:54,196
I tend not to post about them

33
00:01:58,451 --> 00:01:59,827
Do, do you...[stuttering]

34
00:01:59,827 --> 00:02:02,788
Do you often post about social issues on your social media?

35
00:02:02,788 --> 00:02:04,957
I don’t post about them often,

36
00:02:05,166 --> 00:02:10,296
but I like people who are interested in social issues and voicing their opinions out loud

37
00:02:10,588 --> 00:02:13,674
Because it’s a sign showing that they are not indifferent about these issues

38
00:02:14,008 --> 00:02:15,259
For me...

39
00:02:15,259 --> 00:02:17,762
I think that everyone...

40
00:02:17,762 --> 00:02:20,181
I think that everyone pays attention to social issues

41
00:02:20,181 --> 00:02:20,681
Yes.

42
00:02:20,681 --> 00:02:22,058
But I don’t particularly see the reason...

43
00:02:22,058 --> 00:02:24,560
wh, why they should post about them on social media...[stuttering hard]

44
00:02:25,144 --> 00:02:28,230
ca, causing disputes in the comment section [stuttering again]

45
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:32,401
and being stressed about it;

46
00:02:32,401 --> 00:02:33,235
Ah..

47
00:02:33,235 --> 00:02:35,237
Because it's one's choice...

48
00:02:35,237 --> 00:02:36,781
- Aha..
- I tend not to post them

49
00:02:36,781 --> 00:02:38,115
I see...

50
00:02:41,577 --> 00:02:42,244
“When seeing women smoking,”

51
00:02:42,244 --> 00:02:46,165
“When seeing women smoking,”
You glance over vs You don’t glance 

52
00:02:46,165 --> 00:02:48,042
I said I glance over

53
00:02:51,545 --> 00:02:52,713
Why do you glance at them?

54
00:02:52,797 --> 00:02:54,632
Ah.. look...[stuttering]

55
00:02:54,632 --> 00:02:55,758
um....[stuttering2]

56
00:02:55,758 --> 00:02:58,552
It’s not because a woman is smoking, but....

57
00:02:58,552 --> 00:02:59,303
Yes.

58
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:02,556
but because s,socially and culturally in Korea, [keep stuttering]

59
00:03:02,556 --> 00:03:03,182
Yes.

60
00:03:03,849 --> 00:03:08,062
it, it’s an uncommon sight [stuttering well]

61
00:03:08,062 --> 00:03:10,981
But on the other hand, even if I gla…[stuttering worse]

62
00:03:10,981 --> 00:03:12,316
...............[chaos]

63
00:03:12,316 --> 00:03:13,192
if I glance over, 

64
00:03:13,192 --> 00:03:13,943
Yeah....

65
00:03:13,943 --> 00:03:14,944
and....

66
00:03:15,194 --> 00:03:16,987
Hold on. I’m sorry, I’m so sorry 

67
00:03:16,987 --> 00:03:19,198
I'm really-really sorry

68
00:03:19,365 --> 00:03:20,198
Am I funny?

69
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:21,742
No, I’m so sorry, omg sorry

70
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:26,413
Women and men are both humans [peacefully]

71
00:03:26,413 --> 00:03:28,749
so of course women also have urge to smoke

72
00:03:28,749 --> 00:03:30,876
or wish to try it out

73
00:03:30,876 --> 00:03:34,088
to see if it will relieve stress, or something like…

74
00:03:34,088 --> 00:03:36,465
..............[chaos again]

75
00:03:36,507 --> 00:03:39,176
Can I get a drink of water?

76
00:03:42,179 --> 00:03:44,473
My th... my thoughts won’t come out well LOL

77
00:03:44,515 --> 00:03:47,476
To me, cigarette in itself is considered “preference in foods”

78
00:03:47,476 --> 00:03:50,896
and while it is a natural thing for men to smoke it,

79
00:03:50,896 --> 00:03:55,025
when women do, it always grabs attention,

80
00:03:55,067 --> 00:03:56,986
- which I don’t like
- Ah..

81
00:03:56,986 --> 00:04:00,322
So I’d like someone I’m seeing to also not care about it

82
00:04:00,447 --> 00:04:03,159
and not really glance over

83
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:05,452
I don’t really glance over a lot either,

84
00:04:05,452 --> 00:04:09,248
but when I do, it makes me reflect on myself

85
00:04:09,248 --> 00:04:10,583
- Doing a double-take on yourself?
- Yeah yeah

86
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:14,170
- So far, it’s still like that
- Yeah, to this day,

87
00:04:14,378 --> 00:04:17,298
Korea still has remains of this kind of attitude 

88
00:04:18,215 --> 00:04:19,383
Mid-Inspection

89
00:04:19,508 --> 00:04:21,051
Mid-inspection..

90
00:04:24,805 --> 00:04:27,433
My image of her was on the calmer and gentler side,

91
00:04:27,433 --> 00:04:30,895
but her ideas are clear, 

92
00:04:30,895 --> 00:04:35,941
which is slightly unexpected

93
00:04:38,402 --> 00:04:41,572
He seems to be really nice and gentle

94
00:04:41,572 --> 00:04:48,245
But I like a personality that is self-assertive and concrete

95
00:04:48,454 --> 00:04:51,332
In that sense, it’s not a perfect fit but

96
00:04:51,332 --> 00:04:53,167
he seems to be very thoughtful, kind,

97
00:04:53,167 --> 00:04:55,669
and good at listening to others

98
00:04:57,129 --> 00:04:58,964
-Values-

99
00:05:01,884 --> 00:05:02,468
“Partner’s experience living with their previous partner(s)”

100
00:05:02,468 --> 00:05:06,513
“Partner’s experience living with their previous partner(s)”
You are bothered vs You aren’t bothered

101
00:05:06,513 --> 00:05:08,766
I picked “I’m not bothered”

102
00:05:12,853 --> 00:05:14,104
It doesn’t bother you?

103
00:05:14,104 --> 00:05:15,439
Yes 

104
00:05:15,439 --> 00:05:17,566
You don’t care about their past?

105
00:05:17,566 --> 00:05:19,652
Is there anyone who doesn’t have a past?

106
00:05:19,652 --> 00:05:21,111
- I live by this principle
- That's true... Yes

107
00:05:21,111 --> 00:05:24,323
It’s not really good to be bothered by stuff this, you know?

108
00:05:24,323 --> 00:05:26,367
It’s something that I don’t need to be bothered by

109
00:05:26,367 --> 00:05:28,869
and something I shouldn’t be talking about either

110
00:05:28,869 --> 00:05:32,498
I’m not the type to be so hung up on the past

111
00:05:32,498 --> 00:05:33,582
Ah

112
00:05:33,791 --> 00:05:36,835
I don’t think I’ll be bothered too much either

113
00:05:36,835 --> 00:05:39,255
- Since past is something that has already passed
- Right

114
00:05:39,255 --> 00:05:43,092
This person could have dated other women too,

115
00:05:43,092 --> 00:05:45,678
so I said I’m not bothered

116
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:48,973
“Friend’s ex”

117
00:05:48,973 --> 00:05:50,517
“Friend’s ex”
It’s okay to date them vs It’s not okay to date them

118
00:05:54,061 --> 00:05:55,896
I say it’s not okay to date them

119
00:06:00,192 --> 00:06:02,820
Why did you choose that it’s not okay to date them?

120
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:04,822
Even if it’s someone I’m really attracted to,

121
00:06:04,822 --> 00:06:09,576
if it’s someone who has dated a close friend,

122
00:06:09,785 --> 00:06:11,287
that’s a factor that will bother me

123
00:06:11,287 --> 00:06:14,206
and it can also change the relationship with my friend

124
00:06:14,331 --> 00:06:18,627
I think I’ll always choose my friend, even if it’s someone I really like

125
00:06:18,627 --> 00:06:20,838
I’m the same with you

126
00:06:21,046 --> 00:06:24,842
 Some people might consider it as the past, but it deals with someone who’s a part of my life

127
00:06:25,009 --> 00:06:28,304
As you said, I feel similarly about it

128
00:06:28,304 --> 00:06:29,555
Mmm. I see

129
00:06:32,766 --> 00:06:33,309
“Giving up my dreams for my partner”

130
00:06:33,309 --> 00:06:37,938
“Giving up my dreams for my partner”
It’s possible vs It’s not possible

131
00:06:37,938 --> 00:06:40,441
I picked it’s possible

132
00:06:44,528 --> 00:06:48,157
So you can give up your dreams for your girlfriend?

133
00:06:49,867 --> 00:06:50,810
Yes

134
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:51,869
Oh..

135
00:06:52,119 --> 00:06:53,787
When I’m dating someone,

136
00:06:53,787 --> 00:06:55,789
I’m the type to be very dedicated

137
00:06:56,466 --> 00:07:00,085
If I think that it would be nice to marry this person,

138
00:07:00,085 --> 00:07:04,423
then I think about things I might have to sacrifice.

139
00:07:04,423 --> 00:07:06,383
What’s your reasoning for saying it’s not possible?

140
00:07:06,383 --> 00:07:09,803
- My partner is my partner and my life is my life, you know?
- Right

141
00:07:09,803 --> 00:07:14,892
So the idea of giving up my dreams for my partner is

142
00:07:14,892 --> 00:07:15,809
something I wouldn’t do

143
00:07:16,602 --> 00:07:18,062
My life is more important

144
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:20,064
and since I am the center of my life

145
00:07:20,064 --> 00:07:27,696
So the person I’m seeing should have pride in their life and our differences

146
00:07:27,696 --> 00:07:29,281
It’s not that I don’t have pride

147
00:07:29,281 --> 00:07:30,199
Yeah haha

148
00:07:30,491 --> 00:07:33,619
- But you know there are different kinds of work
- Yeah

149
00:07:34,411 --> 00:07:40,501
 For me, it’s possible to change my dreams accordingly

150
00:07:40,501 --> 00:07:42,002
Ah.... Okay....

151
00:07:43,545 --> 00:07:44,088
“In order to sleep together, you have to be in a relationship”

152
00:07:44,088 --> 00:07:45,964
“In order to sleep together, you have to be in a relationship”
Yes vs No

153
00:07:45,964 --> 00:07:49,551
“In order to sleep together, you have to be in a relationship” …

154
00:07:49,551 --> 00:07:51,345
I chose yes

155
00:07:54,890 --> 00:07:58,310
- For me, even if I’m not in a relationship,
- Yeah

156
00:07:58,310 --> 00:08:01,939
if it’s someone who is a good match for me and we connect well,

157
00:08:01,939 --> 00:08:05,818
I think we can do it without adhering to the timeline

158
00:08:05,818 --> 00:08:08,487
I think that the sentence “you need to be in a relationship to sleep together,”

159
00:08:08,487 --> 00:08:10,280
also includes one-night stands.

160
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:12,866
They might have STD’s and

161
00:08:12,866 --> 00:08:15,160
and I think other risks like that are pretty big

162
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:20,374
I don’t think it’s right to risk those things simply for the pleasure

163
00:08:20,374 --> 00:08:24,628
So in circumstances where both parties like each other but are not in a relationship,

164
00:08:24,628 --> 00:08:29,216
do you still think it’s not okay?

165
00:08:29,216 --> 00:08:30,384
Uhh,

166
00:08:30,384 --> 00:08:33,512
Do you think it’s only possible if they are officially your girlfriend?

167
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:34,763
If both parties like each other,

168
00:08:35,013 --> 00:08:38,142
wouldn’t we be dating? That’s what I think

169
00:08:38,142 --> 00:08:41,061
It’s possible to go into a relationship after making love

170
00:08:41,061 --> 00:08:46,442
But what if someone you are “seeing” also see other people or, 

171
00:08:46,442 --> 00:08:48,193
So basically not in a relationship?

172
00:08:48,193 --> 00:08:50,362
Yes, not in a relationship and both parties are meeting other people

173
00:08:50,362 --> 00:08:54,199
I should be making a decision. It won’t be taken so lightly

174
00:08:54,199 --> 00:08:56,285
and only be done when I have some certainties

175
00:08:56,285 --> 00:09:00,873
I think that’s really possible

176
00:09:01,415 --> 00:09:03,542
Yep, I understand

177
00:09:03,792 --> 00:09:07,379
Final Decision

178
00:09:11,133 --> 00:09:16,180

00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:17,306
How was it?

180
00:09:17,598 --> 00:09:18,692
You seemed nervous. 

181
00:09:18,692 --> 00:09:23,353
Yeah because there are cameras and lights,

182
00:09:23,353 --> 00:09:24,980
I was kind of in a daze

183
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:27,357
- It’s still pretty awkward? It’s weird, huh?
- Yeah honestly

184
00:09:27,357 --> 00:09:28,609
You don’t really know what you said, right?

185
00:09:28,609 --> 00:09:29,485
Yeah

186
00:09:29,485 --> 00:09:30,277
LOL

187
00:09:30,277 --> 00:09:32,196
Like the things I thought, I couldn’t really,

188
00:09:32,196 --> 00:09:33,697
Yeah like you couldn’t really organize them into words

189
00:09:33,697 --> 00:09:35,240
- Couldn’t really circulate them
- Ah...

190
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:35,866
It happens

191
00:09:35,866 --> 00:09:38,202
I’m expecting some hate comments

192
00:09:38,202 --> 00:09:38,994
Why?

193
00:09:38,994 --> 00:09:42,372
Because my perspectives are a little different from others’

194
00:09:42,372 --> 00:09:46,168
Are you the type to care about those hate comments?

195
00:09:46,168 --> 00:09:47,127
I just...

196
00:09:47,127 --> 00:09:48,212
I’ll laugh them off

197
00:09:48,629 --> 00:09:50,088
So you are saying you don’t care

198
00:09:50,297 --> 00:09:53,383
I think it’ll be funny if they get angry at me...

199
00:09:53,383 --> 00:09:54,843
- Really..
- But I don’t think I’ll be offended

200
00:09:54,843 --> 00:09:56,011
Think you’ll laugh it off?

201
00:09:56,011 --> 00:09:56,970
Yeah

202
00:09:56,970 --> 00:09:58,388
Even if it’s really harsh?

203
00:09:58,388 --> 00:10:01,266
They don’t really know me..

204
00:10:01,266 --> 00:10:02,351
You are a pretty chill person

205
00:10:02,809 --> 00:10:04,186
I’m actually just pretending to be

206
00:10:04,686 --> 00:10:05,395
Wh.....

207
00:10:05,395 --> 00:10:06,813
What is this person lol

208
00:10:06,813 --> 00:10:08,148
How would you react if you got hate comments?

209
00:10:08,482 --> 00:10:09,566
- Me?
- Yeah

210
00:10:09,566 --> 00:10:14,530
I’m also not the type to care about others’ opinions about me,

211
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:15,948
but I’ll probably still read them

212
00:10:15,948 --> 00:10:19,284
 I just won’t be hung up on that or be hurt

213
00:10:19,284 --> 00:10:24,206
I think that some people will be critical of me and others will relate with me

214
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:33,048
The light will be turned off on the side that sent an X
