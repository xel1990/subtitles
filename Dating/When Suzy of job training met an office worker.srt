1
00:00:04,180 --> 00:00:06,180
I really wanted to look back

2
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:07,800
Among the entertainers l listened to, l resembled Suzy

3
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:19,480
&lt;When Suzy of job training met an office worker&gt;

4
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:22,020
Hello

5
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:28,000
I’m 29 years old, Kwang-Geun hong and I’m an office worker at a company located in Samsung station.

6
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:37,660
Hello I’m 24 years old , job seeker and I would like to meet someone who looks like a man with a lively personality.

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,120
I would like to meet an active person who is not passive.

8
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:43,240
I'm pretty nervous right now.

9
00:00:43,660 --> 00:00:46,200
I’m really curious so mad.

10
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:51,680
Hello

11
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,880
So be awkward and I really wanted to look back

12
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:57,020
Very fluttered

13
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:07,260
I think his voice was so good that I thought I wanted to see his face once.

14
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,100
What style of appearance do you like?

15
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:14,740
I like manly man.

16
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:22,900
I want him to be a positive, leadable, dependable man.

17
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:24,240
Are you being dragged?

18
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:30,440
I want someone who can depend on each other rather than being dragged around.

19
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:35,340
I like men with sexy looks

20
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:42,760
What do you think of your appearance in a 100-point scale?

21
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:43,780
And why?

22
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:46,500
Could I rate it as a 10-point rating?

23
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:49,480
Yes, please tell me a 10-point rating.

24
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:50,960
I want to give 7points to me.

25
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:53,860
Please tell me why.

26
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:07,080
Because I think my face isn’t bad but my face isn’t popular nowadays, So cut three points.

27
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:09,960
Are you satisfied with your face?

28
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:12,300
I’m not dissatisfied.

29
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:18,620
Who do you look like from entertainers

30
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:20,260
and What part does it look like?

31
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:27,240
Among the entertainers l listened to, l resembled Suzy.

32
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:34,480
I think it’s okay…

33
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:35,680
wait um..

34
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:39,640
There is no one who doesn’t like Suzy.

35
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:45,560
If she resembles Suzy, then I should go back for sure.

36
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:49,320
What style do you usually wear?

37
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:51,280
It's different every time.

38
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:54,000
Do you mean you wear different clothes depending on the situation?

39
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:54,640
Right

40
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,680
It depends on where to go.

41
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:00,000
It’s plain

42
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,760
I think he can wear different style of clothes depending on the situation

43
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:10,460
Who do you live with?

44
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:13,080
I live with my family,

45
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:17,800
I have a sister and a younger brother, and I’m second.

46
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:21,640
I’m raising three Maltese.

47
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:22,620
Puppies?

48
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:23,640
yes

49
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:31,240
I think people who are raising puppies usually have a responsibility

50
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:34,160
and tend to take care of others.

51
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:37,700
What about your family members?

52
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:40,420
No brothers. I’m an only son.

53
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:42,800
And my parents are abroad now.

54
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:50,460
I went forward not because his parents are abroad but rather he is only son

55
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,460
The only son would be likely to be lonely

56
00:03:54,720 --> 00:04:01,360
I went forward because I thought there would be a different side from those who had sisters and brothers.

57
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,920
What do you do on a day off?

58
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:11,640
I like to do pilates on a day off or go to a good restaurant with my friends.

59
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:15,900
So go to a good restaurant or excercise

60
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:18,480
Really?

61
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:21,240
I also like to eat,

62
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:24,800
and no one will hate a woman who does pilates.

63
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:32,380
Do you usually exercise in self-management or have a hobby?

64
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:35,240
I used to play kendo before,

65
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:41,060
and I’m usually playing soccer with my friends in the neighborhood every weekend.

66
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,560
And doing boxing these days.

67
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:49,000
Do you have a hobby that you want to be with your lover?

68
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:58,720
As you said, l like to go to a good restaurant and want to eat a variety of things together.

69
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:01,080
Do you like to play around?

70
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:02,060
Yes,

71
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:04,580
I got a car recently

72
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:12,520
and like to drive around here and there.

73
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:16,200
Just before, I said I liked to go to a good restaurant,

74
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:22,720
so he remember my story and he answered
me also like to do.

75
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:26,720
l felt l could go with him , so I went back.

76
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:36,180
And he said he got a car recently and I thought I could drive with him.

77
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:37,560
Do you have a religion?

78
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:41,100
I am atheism.

79
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:47,100
Are there any three things you should keep in your lover relationship?

80
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:52,520
First, I do no often contact her when I work,

81
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:54,540
so I hope she understands this point,

82
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:57,240
Second, I hope she doesn’t drink alcohol often.

83
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:00,780
Third I wish there was no time limit to go home to her.

84
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,720
Do you want the time she go home to be unrestricted?

85
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,160
Yes, I want.

86
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:11,560
I think that communication is important in the relationship of lovers

87
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:13,820
and that’s when the man told me about the contact,

88
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:15,420
so I got a good feeling.

89
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:19,660
But He told me he wanted her to have no curfew,

90
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:23,400
but how could he tell things the first time
I saw him?

91
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:25,420
Do you actually have curfew?

92
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:26,720
Nothing.

93
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:35,140
Do you think there are three things I need to know to get close to you?

94
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:37,280
At first I feel a lot of strangers,

95
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:43,060
you may feel it is not funny,

96
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:46,240
but when you got close to me,

97
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:52,580
you’ll feel like I’m a fun person.

98
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,620
That’s first.

99
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:59,280
The second, I have ever lived in a foreign country

100
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:03,420
so there are occasions when things are not conservative sometimes.

101
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:09,780
And the third

102
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,120
I love animals very much.

103
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:18,820
Are there three things I need to know to get close to you?

104
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:21,420
I like fun things,

105
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:28,500
I like the cultural life so I could watch movies like that

106
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:34,360
And I want you to respect the opponent.

107
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,920
The person has own opinion.

108
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:42,880
Could it be close if you respect the other person’s opinion?

109
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:49,900
I think it’s really important to respect other opinion.

110
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:56,200
I liked it because she talked about what I always thought was important,

111
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,220
so I went back.

112
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:05,040
How many times do you have a message and a phone call a day in a lover relationship?

113
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,300
I do not know well,

114
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:09,940
it’s been too long since I have not been dating.

115
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:12,780
Denpending on what the next day it is.

116
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:20,880
Just as much as I like.

117
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,920
He didn’t tell me specifically,

118
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:32,540
just he said I often get in touch and depends on the next day

119
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:37,180
Ah~~even if he contact the person he like, he are concerned about the next day.

120
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:41,120
In that respect, the good feelings are little gone so I went forward one step.

121
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:43,700
Blind date end.

122
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,780
They’ve talked so far…

123
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:47,640
Time to check each other

124
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:07,340
Hello.

125
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:13,680
Nice meet you.

126
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:15,640
So beautiful.

127
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:16,700
Thank you.

128
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:18,240
You’re so cool, too.

129
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:23,220
When I heard the voice, it was okay.

130
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:27,460
It is bass.  A voice that woman would like

131
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:31,060
I want to see his face quickly.

132
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:35,800
At first, her voice is very blunt and pronunciation is also blunt well…

133
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:38,700
Is she so serious? but

134
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:43,120
The more I heard the more attractive the husky voice was and

135
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:45,080
She looks like an entertainer

136
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:49,280
The eyes were very big and there were dots under my eyes like me

137
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:59,220
I thought it was a manly appearance, but it was not

138
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:04,660
And the double eyelids were dark but weren’t

139
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:06,720
Just it was normal?

140
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:09,960
He seem to be a normal guy.
