going to someone else’s home

45
00:02:15,718 --> 00:02:19,389
and homes should be kept private especially in the beginning of a relationship

46
00:02:19,389 --> 00:02:21,391

These were the two thoughts that came to mind

181
00:08:29,967 --> 00:08:32,428
And you could say that the parents transferred the right to discipline to the teacher

182
00:08:32,428 --> 00:08:35,681
So in that sense, wouldn’t it be possible?

183
00:08:35,681 --> 00:08:38,601
I also grew up in a generation where physical discipline was possible,

184
00:08:38,601 --> 00:08:43,189
And my parents raised me very strictly,

185
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:46,943
But I still think that teachers cannot beat students.

186
00:08:46,943 --> 00:08:48,736
Hm so if,

187
00:08:48,736 --> 00:08:50,488
Let me give you a hypothetical

188
00:08:50,488 --> 00:08:53,282
Let’s say at school, a student curses at the teacher

189
00:08:53,282 --> 00:08:57,036
And ends up slapping the teacher’s face

190
00:08:57,036 --> 00:08:59,455
In that situation,

191
00:08:59,455 --> 00:09:01,374
Would ‘spank/hit the student’

192
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:02,750
Not be one of the possible choices of action?

193
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:04,669
No, it is not.

194
00:09:04,669 --> 00:09:08,047
If I were in that situation, I would just leave the scene

195
00:09:08,047 --> 00:09:10,132
Or leave the evidence

196
00:09:10,132 --> 00:09:12,009
And solve it by law

197
00:09:12,009 --> 00:09:13,678
I would never, do the same

198
00:09:13,678 --> 00:09:15,846
I wouldn’t go into physical violence

199
00:09:15,846 --> 00:09:17,431
Let’s say, what if there was a clause in the school’s regulation that

200
00:09:17,431 --> 00:09:20,309
Physical punishment can be given in certain circumstances,

201
00:09:20,309 --> 00:09:24,272
Would you say that’s wrong, too?

202
00:09:24,272 --> 00:09:25,231
No, not in that case.

203
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:30,152
The parents who sent their kids to that school would’ve seen and agreed to those regulations

204
00:09:30,152 --> 00:09:33,072
And it's a matter between a group that shares the same values,

205
00:09:33,072 --> 00:09:35,866
So I’m not in the place to say

206
00:09:35,866 --> 00:09:38,536
Whether that’s right or wrong.

207
00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:44,000

[Do you want another date? Send O or X]

209
00:09:57,972 --> 00:10:00,057
How was it for you today?

210
00:10:00,725 --> 00:10:03,227
It’s my first blind date, ever

211
00:10:03,227 --> 00:10:05,229
I felt kind of nervous

212
00:10:05,229 --> 00:10:07,231
for the first time in a while

213
00:10:07,982 --> 00:10:09,525
I enjoyed it

214
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:11,902
I just,

215
00:10:11,902 --> 00:10:14,155
I feel like I didn’t speak very eloquently today

216
00:10:14,155 --> 00:10:15,698
I kinda feel like an idiot

217
00:10:16,907 --> 00:10:19,744
Probably gonna go laugh/cry in the corner when I get home today

218
00:10:19,744 --> 00:10:21,245
So yeah.. but

219
00:10:21,245 --> 00:10:22,622
It was fun!

220
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:24,332
Unlike somebody over here,

221
00:10:24,332 --> 00:10:25,041
I’ve been on a blind date before, so.
