00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:05,410
Matt: There's one word that gorgeous
women rarely hear, probably because it's pretty

2
00:00:05,410 --> 00:00:11,099
counterintuitive but it can actually boost
attraction, get a girl to start chasing you and

3
00:00:11,099 --> 00:00:16,510
make her see you as a real man. Now that one
word and the concept that I'm about to share

4
00:00:16,510 --> 00:00:22,540
with you can set you apart from all other
guys and get her to see you as the prize! My

5
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:30,680
name is Matt Artisan from The Attractive Man,
and this is one word that will make women chase you.

6
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:33,990
-Intro sequece-

7
00:00:39,290 --> 00:00:45,410
Matt: Now what I'm about to share with
you is slightly controversial. I know that

8
00:00:45,410 --> 00:00:49,989
some of you guys watching this video probably
won't agree with what I'm about to say but

9
00:00:49,989 --> 00:00:55,210
first let me share a quick story I was in
Belgrade Serbia about five years ago about

10
00:00:55,210 --> 00:01:01,540
to teach a boot camp and I see this gorgeous
supermodel looking goddess walking down the

11
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:06,270
street and naturally I run into when I approach
her by the way is exactly how to do that in

12
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:10,850
other videos here on the channel and everything
was going great you know she was into the

13
00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:16,530
approach but she told me she's in a hurry
she said she has to go. Girl: I have to go!

14
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:22,299
Matt: No, what you have to do is tell me one cool thing about you, then you can go. Now I know that kind of

15
00:01:22,299 --> 00:01:28,010
seems like a Dick thing to say you know girls
in a hurry and I tell her no he can't go yet

16
00:01:28,010 --> 00:01:33,550
but her eyes lit up partly in shock you can
believe I said that but I was all like you

17
00:01:33,550 --> 00:01:37,869
know that sparkle in her eyes like I could
tell she was more attracted to me probably

18
00:01:37,869 --> 00:01:42,549
because she had never heard anything like
that before the truth is that the hottest

19
00:01:42,549 --> 00:01:48,090
women are used to men throwing themselves
at them and they're used to getting everything

20
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:53,380
handed really to them right on to work for
anything and everything for free for example

21
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:58,119
when I lived in Las Vegas I did a really attractive
cocktail waitress and you get into the hottest

22
00:01:58,119 --> 00:02:04,119
clubs for free get bottle service for free
like ten thousand dollar tables she would

23
00:02:04,119 --> 00:02:09,890
get really expensive meals paid for her should
even get invited to expensive vacations just

24
00:02:09,890 --> 00:02:15,670
because she was hot see when women get everything
they want at no cost then they start to expect

25
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:20,790
it and pretty soon they don't value it as
much doesn't mean that necessarily don't appreciate

26
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:25,630
it it just means they don't value the men
who give them everything for really without

27
00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:30,209
them having to aren't just because they're
hot on top of that beautiful women almost

28
00:02:30,209 --> 00:02:37,129
never have to work for a man being attracted
to her right may just flocked to her because

29
00:02:37,129 --> 00:02:42,450
she's so damn good looking and you never have
to do anything to like earned his interest

30
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:47,110
these women are used to guys showing way too
much interest too soon and putting them on

31
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:51,800
a pedestal. So if you want to attract these
kinds of women who are used to guys just fawning

32
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:57,500
all over them because they're so damn hot,
and you have to do the exact opposite. Stop

33
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:02,410
putting women on a pedestal! Now before I forget

36
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:15,540
what that one word is you know that will
set you apart from all those suffocating guys

37
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:21,680
who will do anything she wants and hopes for
small piece of the pie it's the word "NO". No

38
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:29,300
no no that's right just saying the word no
two beautiful woman who's used to getting

39
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:35,209
everything handed to her on a silver platter
is very intriguing you see men that don't

40
00:03:35,209 --> 00:03:42,659
stick to their guns and sacrifice their own
needs wants passions desires get walked over

41
00:03:42,659 --> 00:03:48,050
by women and are not respected for example
let's say you're or mission at this point

42
00:03:48,050 --> 00:03:52,800
in your life is to write a novel so every
night you go down to your basement at some

43
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:58,879
peace and quiet to work on your novel but
your wife constantly keep pulling you from

44
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:04,450
it she's asking for help with the dishes or
clean the house or just to spend some time

45
00:04:04,450 --> 00:04:09,150
with her or even have sex with her and it's
kind of hard to say no to that one but if

46
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:14,790
you keep on putting your novel side just to
please your woman and eventually just give

47
00:04:14,790 --> 00:04:20,169
up on it and you realize all I just need to
focus on her am to please her and make her

48
00:04:20,169 --> 00:04:25,949
my passion my mission she will not only lose
respect for you but her attraction for you

49
00:04:25,949 --> 00:04:26,949
will die.

50
00:04:26,949 --> 00:04:31,659
What's really important is that
you don't put a woman before your mission

51
00:04:31,659 --> 00:04:38,099
or purpose in life. David Deida said in his
book "The way of the superior man" if a man prioritizes

52
00:04:38,099 --> 00:04:45,009
his relationship over his highest purpose
he weakens himself deserves the universe and

53
00:04:45,009 --> 00:04:51,259
she says woman of an authentic man who can
offer his full undivided presence even if

54
00:04:51,259 --> 00:04:56,319
she says that she wants to be number one in
your life what you really want is to support

55
00:04:56,319 --> 00:05:01,659
a man in his mission and purpose just one
man who throws it all away just for her once

56
00:05:01,659 --> 00:05:06,509
in awhile she might even test you to see if
she can knock you off your course a good woman

57
00:05:06,509 --> 00:05:12,539
will do this now she doesn't want to actually
knock you off your course she just wants to

58
00:05:12,539 --> 00:05:18,949
feel that you are a real man that can stand
up to her and say no to her now course he's

59
00:05:18,949 --> 00:05:23,669
probably gonna be a little displeased that
she didn't get what she wanted but should

60
00:05:23,669 --> 00:05:28,409
be more attracted to you in the long run now
this doesn't mean that you should say no to

61
00:05:28,409 --> 00:05:34,129
everything she wants or use it as some sort
of manipulation tactic just like in the novel

62
00:05:34,129 --> 00:05:39,900
example you might say yes to her sometimes
it's all about balance you say no when you

63
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:45,629
really need it and I can apply at any point
interaction like with a girl in Serbia I said

64
00:05:45,629 --> 00:05:50,610
a within a minute of meeting her now that's
not gonna work all the time if the girl wasn't

65
00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:55,569
attracted to me she probably would just laughed
and walked away but the point is to be more

66
00:05:55,569 --> 00:06:00,300
of a challenge with women so that they see
you as a real man instead of a suffocating

67
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:01,849
me little child.

68
00:06:01,849 --> 00:06:06,969
And this isn't meant to be like
a harsh thing you don't actually have to say

69
00:06:06,969 --> 00:06:13,789
the word no all the time no no no no you can
just make fun little restrictions every time

70
00:06:13,789 --> 00:06:20,479
you also make a request I call this technique
restricted requests let's go back to my place

71
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:26,039
but no sex let's go get copy but only for
ten minutes then I have to go no touching

72
00:06:26,039 --> 00:06:30,379
below the belt here but your number here but
no calling twenty times a day.

73
00:06:30,379 --> 00:06:33,639
That's all you get no more.

74
00:06:33,639 --> 00:06:38,800
Now obviously these are just little
one liner examples what women usually love

75
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:43,800
them because they leave them wanting more
when you put a restriction on something it

76
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:48,770
shows you that you're not that easy like you
know every other guy that she's used to because

77
00:06:48,770 --> 00:06:53,099
it's no fun for a woman if she knows about
a shadow of a doubt that you're a hundred

78
00:06:53,099 --> 00:06:58,279
percent into her in the old pretty much do
anything for her she actually wants to wonder

79
00:06:58,279 --> 00:07:04,349
a little and she wants to even have to win
you over this is actually the basis of flirting

80
00:07:04,349 --> 00:07:08,779
flirting is not just showing your interest
all the time it showing your interest but

81
00:07:08,779 --> 00:07:12,909
then playfully taking away keeps are guessing
a little bit which makes things a lot more

82
00:07:12,909 --> 00:07:18,129
interesting for women love to tax the color
girlfriends at all he did this thing it was

83
00:07:18,129 --> 00:07:22,369
so sweet they really show that was into me
but they did this other thing and I'm not

84
00:07:22,369 --> 00:07:25,990
really sure of using to me what you think
about that and they don't call it girlfriend

85
00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:31,531
getting opinions love doing that if she knows
right away that you're totally in love with

86
00:07:31,531 --> 00:07:38,129
her you'd go home with or even make your girlfriend
then the game is over for her the fun for

87
00:07:38,129 --> 00:07:43,339
her is in the flirting so if you're the type
of guy that never says no to women and you're

88
00:07:43,339 --> 00:07:48,639
not used to using restrictions then start
doing it you'll notice that her eyes light

89
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:53,599
up as she realizes that you're different in
all the other guys out there and she begins

90
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:58,419
looking back with you now if you really want
to know how to be a challenge I created a

91
00:07:58,419 --> 00:08:04,569
YouTube video that's all about qualification
which is one of the best concepts principles

92
00:08:04,569 --> 00:08:08,930
tactics whatever you wanna call it when it
comes to being a challenge you should be doing

93
00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:14,479
this in all of your interactions through out
the interaction because it's one of the best

94
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:20,039
ways to get her to see you as the prize and
get her to start chasing you within minutes

95
00:08:20,039 --> 00:08:24,119
sometimes even seconds of meeting so check
