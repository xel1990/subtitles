00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,240
YUMI HAS DONE AS FAR AS _______ FOR HER BOYFRIEND.

2
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:04,640
Cosplay

3
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:08,720
Am I wrong?

4
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:18,180
Hello

5
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:19,620
Hello

6
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:23,540
My name is Kang Seong Goo

7
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:25,040
I am Yumi.

8
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:28,620
Have you done any day time drinking before?

9
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:29,760
No, it's my first time.

10
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:34,260
Still, alcohol will help us get to know each other.

11
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:42,960
Where are you from?

12
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,000
I'm from Cheon-an

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:44,800
ah~

14
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:46,380
I'm from Cheong-ju

15
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:48,320
Ah, we live close to each other.

16
00:00:49,660 --> 00:00:51,060
If you say Cheon-an

17
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:52,020
Yawoori…

18
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:53,140
You’re right.

19
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:54,780
Dujeong-dong

20
00:00:58,060 --> 00:00:59,720
Do you want another shot?

21
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:01,620
Yes, please

22
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:04,600
Do I just draw a card?

23
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:12,320
FROM THE FIRST IMPRESSION, ________ COUNTRY MATCHES YUMI’S IMAGE.

24
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:17,640
Vietnam

25
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:22,360
Wow…

26
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:23,200
No

27
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:27,900
because my friends told me women from Vietnam are very pretty.

28
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:29,460
I've never heard that before

29
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:31,720
Really? It’s not easy…

30
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:33,360
We are not clicking

31
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:41,240
SEONG GOO GLANCES AT _____ PART OF THE BODY FIRST WHEN HE SEES A GIRL

32
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:42,500
Her leg

33
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:44,480
Her leg?

34
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:45,820
It's kinda similar.

35
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:49,540
I'll give you one more chance.

36
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:51,180
Ankles on her leg?

37
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:53,060
You're correct. Her ankles.

38
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:55,480
Ankles? That sounds perverted.

39
00:01:57,020 --> 00:01:59,020
Why the ankles?

40
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,360
Right when you see a girl, you look straight at the ankles?

41
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:05,000
No, not in a perverted way.

42
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,600
I really like women who wear jeans

43
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:10,260
and you can always see their ankles when they wear jeans.

44
00:02:10,540 --> 00:02:12,540
I know you might not understand...

45
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:13,900
No, I cannot understand.

46
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:16,580
But there might be people here who are like that..

47
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:20,740
What do you look for in a man when you’re interested?

48
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:21,540
His vibe.

49
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:23,840
His vibe? Let’s be honest.

50
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:28,140
No really, I don’t only look at his face or his body, but…

51
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,980
So vibe as in everything combined?

52
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:31,860
Yes yes.

53
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:33,660
But I do prefer masculine vibe in a guy.

54
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:38,200
YUMI IS SELF-CONSCIOUS ABOUT _______ PART OF HER BODY.

55
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:44,140
This question is very...

56
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:46,500
I know it’s really awkward to answer…

57
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:47,680
I think it’s…

58
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:51,140
I am thinking of one.

59
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:52,600
But I don’t know if I should say this.

60
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:53,400
Don't say it.

61
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,920
I agree. I don’t think I should say it.

62
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:56,600
Never mind, please just say it. I'm curious

63
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:57,940
Maybe it's this.....

64
00:02:58,700 --> 00:02:59,700
My head?!

65
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:00,580
No, no.

66
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:05,000
I thought you were referring to my brain.

67
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,780
Your heart area?

68
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:15,540
Wait, what?

69
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,320
I definitely need to take a shot on this.

70
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:22,220
Your answer triggers a woman’s self-esteem.

71
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:24,920
so that wasn't the answer?

72
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:26,420
It’s not about getting it right or wrong.

73
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,060
How’s my image?

74
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:34,740
I seem to have all the bad answers.

75
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:38,880
What's your answer?

76
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:39,580
Me?

77
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,880
I have a lot of facial hair

78
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:45,320
so a few months ago,

79
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:47,020
I got laser hair removal.

80
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,020
Why are you laughing?

81
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,440
I don’t think it’s working for you.

82
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,340
It’s not..?

83
00:03:57,580 --> 00:03:59,680
What do you think of guys with facial hair?

84
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,160
I don’t prefer…

85
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:02,660
Do you like the clean-shaven look?

86
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:03,700
Yes I do.

87
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:07,720
YUMI HAS DONE AS FAR AS _______ FOR HER BOYFRIEND.

88
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:12,500
I wasn’t expecting any of these questions.

89
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:14,520
oh, really?

90
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:15,880
Special events?

91
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:18,520
Cosplay!

92
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:23,220
What the heck? I don’t do cosplays

93
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:25,580
Not something perverted.

94
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:27,620
Like a doll mask,

95
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:30,440
I was talking about that kind of events.

96
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:31,460
Like Pikachu?

97
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:33,120
Yes, like...

98
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:34,940
nevermind…

99
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:40,520
I feel like I got punched in the face for this question.

100
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:42,100
What's the answer?

101
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:43,160
Diet.

102
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:45,740
I lost 10kg.

103
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:47,500
Really? Wow.

104
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,840
The answer is lamer than cosplay huh?

105
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,800
I would have never thought of that answer.

106
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,680
It’s so hot in here.

107
00:04:57,260 --> 00:04:59,340
Why cosplay, I'm shocked...

108
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:04,400
YUMI’S LOOKALIKE CELEBRITY IS__________.

109
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,760
I think I can get this right.

110
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:09,520
When I first saw you,

111
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,660
I thought Son Yeon Jae

112
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:13,800
Ohhhhh~ Son Yeon Jae

113
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:15,640
Was that a good answer?

114
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,260
Not bad at all.

115
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:19,620
Who have you heard for your lookalike?

116
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:21,320
You can't guess one?

117
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:23,920
Nothing is ringing my bell…

118
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:26,840
I don’t think I can tell you before you get the answer right…

119
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,940
Well, I’ve heard from TVXQ

120
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:32,720
Who?

121
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:33,920
U-KNOW YUNHO?

122
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:34,980
No you don’t look like him.

123
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:38,100
Oops sorry, but you don’t really look like him…

124
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,880
No, I am the one who is sorry.

125
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,480
Please edit this part.

126
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:45,000
This one is pretty hard.

127
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:51,120
SEONG GOO WOULD SAVE ______ FIRST IF HIS MOM AND GIRLFRIEND ARE BOTH DROWNING

128
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:54,440
I think you will save your mom

129
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:56,360
But

130
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,880
I will save both.

131
00:05:58,880 --> 00:05:59,900
Yeah right?

132
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:01,700
You really had to put it like that?

133
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:06,800
Can you swim?

134
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:07,840
Out of nowhere?

135
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:09,980
What if I said I can’t.

136
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:12,300
If you can't,

137
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:13,820
I can save you.

138
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:16,700
I was a lifeguard. I’ve been swimming for quite long.

139
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:20,880
That's why I said, I'd save both.

140
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:24,940
Your answer is very impressive.

141
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:29,320
Earlier, you were like "yeah right, how can you?"

142
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:30,940
Now that I heard that reason,

143
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,500
Can you trust me now?

144
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:33,460
Yes, I can believe you.

145
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:35,580
Shall we move on?

146
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:38,480
MISSION – TALK WITHOUT HONORIFICS

147
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:40,020
I'm going to talk casually.

148
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:41,780
Alright

149
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:45,800
I am going to start now.

150
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:47,420
OK

151
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:52,180
Let’s talk casually~

152
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:57,420
YUMI CAN GO AS FAR AS _____ IN TERMS OF PHYSICAL TOUCH ON THE FIRST DATE

153
00:06:57,780 --> 00:07:00,740
I feel like this question is put because you can go far.

154
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:02,820
Don't think too much into it.

155
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:03,700
Just me.

156
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:06,260
You want me to answer from just from looking at you?

157
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:11,240
Friendly touch.

158
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,900
Friendly touch?

159
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:14,880
Like lightly hitting on the arm.

160
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:17,580
Am I wrong?

161
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,380
Friendly touch…

162
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:23,620
It just depends on the vibe.

163
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:25,440
I don’t have any limits.

164
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:28,040
How about you? How far can you go?

165
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:32,780
I'm very cautious of physical affection.

166
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:36,080
So unless I’m certain about my feelings, I don’t...

167
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:36,840
Oh you don’t?

168
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:38,520
Yeah I restrain myself.

169
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:40,680
That's a good thing.

170
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:43,980
I never go too far to regret it.

171
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:52,340
SEONG GOO WILL TRAVEL A LONG WAY JUST TO SEE HIS GIRLFRIEND’S FACE FOR 10 MINUTES OR NOT

172
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:54,140
I think you can.

173
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:56,080
Why do you think I can?

174
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:58,760
I just think you'd be very good to your girlfriend.

175
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:00,160
Devoted.

176
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:02,720
When you are in a relationship, you miss that person…

177
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:05,360
Let’s say, if you're in Cheong-ju and I'm in Jejudo,

178
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,060
would you come to see me?

179
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:10,140
If I go, will I be able to spend time with you?

180
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:11,240
Of course

181
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,900
Then I think I would go.

182
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:15,180
Even though it's really difficult?

183
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:19,660
But as soon as I see her, I can relieve my stress.

184
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:28,540
YUMI CAN OR CANNOT WAIT FOR HER BOYFRIEND’S STUDY ABROAD

185
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,500
I think you can.

186
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:32,100
You think I can?

187
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:36,520
But it really depends on the situation

188
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:39,500
If you were in a good strong relationship with someone,

189
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:42,500
I think you can wait for him unconditionally.

190
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:44,320
That’s just my personal thinking of you.

191
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:47,540
I've never waited,

192
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:51,240
but I've had someone wait for me.

193
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,960
So I don’t think I can

194
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:54,980
because I know how hard it is.

195
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:59,460
Personally, I want to study more,

196
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:02,340
maybe in Korea or abroad.

197
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:05,660
And if I get the opportunity to study abroad

198
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:09,700
and I am in a relationship with someone,

199
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:12,160
I would like to go together.

200
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:15,060
Together?

201
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:17,220
That's easier said than done.

202
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:21,020
So you would take your girlfriend all the way..?

203
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:25,240
Yes, but I'll plan and prepare everything ahead.

204
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:27,820
You want it all huh?

205
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:30,580
If I were to ask you,

206
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:34,380
would you be able to go?

207
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:39,160
I think I could

208
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:42,600
if the guy was certain and there's a future together.

209
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:47,220
If everything is prepared and planned, I'd go.

210
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:50,100
It's the last question.

211
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:52,760
It is.

212
00:09:53,340 --> 00:10:00,260
YUMI  FEELS THE SAME OR DIFFERENTLY ABOUT SEONG GOO NOW COMPARED TO THE FIRST MOMENT

213
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:04,620
How do you feel Oppa?

214
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:07,080
Whoa… ‘How do you feel oppa…’

215
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:09,720
Is it same or different?

216
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:11,520
It's different.

217
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:12,980
Me too.

218
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:14,480
Honestly,

219
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,600
in the beginning I wasn't impressed...

220
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:18,340
No, be honest.

221
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:20,700
I wasn’t impressed

222
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:24,200
but as we had more conversation we had a good vibe.

223
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:25,640
I liked it.

224
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:29,940
Do you think you're going to regret coming here today?

225
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:38,660
To be honest, I didn't have any serious expectations.

226
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:41,840
But I felt something I never even imagined.

227
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:43,260
Like a new feeling?

228
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:45,620
What kind of feeling?

229
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:47,380
And that feeling

230
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:49,720
will be a secret…

231
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:54,680
I would like to get to know you more.

232
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:56,340
The time was so limited.

233
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:57,460
Don’t you think?

234
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:00,900
What’s with the fingers

235
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:04,200
Alrighty then

236
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,120
Ok. Alrighty then
