1
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:08,820
Is there anything you would like to do when you date someone?

2
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:11,120
You are similar to me.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,680
I was quite surprised too.

4
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:16,660
I would like to turn back and see you.

5
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:17,940
I would too.

and also whom I can talk to.

00:00:58,560 --> 00:00:59,240
Hello

15
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:01,240

16
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:05,440
So, would you like to ask me a question first?

17
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:08,960
Q. Who is your favorite female celebrity?

18
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:14,580
My favorite female celebrity is Kim, You Jung.

19
00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:16,000
Ah…

20
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,620
I like someone who is outgoing.

21
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:22,800
Uhm, I like Woo Do Hwan.

22
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,500
He is sexy.

23
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:28,920
He has those sexy eyes.

24
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:34,560
Q. What is considered most important when blind dating?

25
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:38,840
For example, out of look, height, personality or etc?

26
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:43,260
It is important how he looks for first confrontation.

27
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:45,800
He does not have to be good looking

28
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:47,980
but the first impression goes long way.

29
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:49,740
I see.

30
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:52,220
Uhm…

31
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:56,820
Q. How do you spend your own spare time?

32
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:04,060
I tend to have a lot of free time on my own so

33
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:06,740
I go out for café,

34
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:12,420
or do shopping in Hongdae or Shinchon.

35
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:15,860
You do not prefer to stay at home for relaxing.

36
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:19,560
I prefer to go home just for sleeping.

37
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:21,800
I also do the same.

38
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:24,180
You very similar to me.

39
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:30,360
Q. What is your favorite food? And What food do you not enjoy?

40
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:33,960
I love eating food.

41
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:37,140
I do not prefer spicy food.

42
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,740
Oh, I also do not like spic food.

43
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:40,600
Oh really?

44
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:43,820
Yes, I actually do enjoy eating food but

45
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:48,380
spicy food is not my favorite.

46
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:51,040
I like most kind of the food except spicy ones.

47
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,260
I also have a sweet tooth.

48
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:55,140
So you eat most kind of the foods.

49
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:56,000
Yes, I do.

50
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:03,980
Q. When you get stressed out, what do you do?

51
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:07,260
I do exercise to release the tension.

52
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:09,500
I also eat delicious foods but

53
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:15,740
eating foods makes me exercise more.

54
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:19,780
I do both exercise and eating.

55
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:24,060
Q. What is the most important thing to consider when dating someone?

56
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:28,200
I think her responsive behavior during the conversation,

57
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:30,920
is important to me.

58
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:37,120
I moved toward him more because

59
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:40,580
his responses were very similar to my thinking.

60
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:46,560
I also think one’s response to my opinion is very important.

61
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,700
So I felt kinship with him.

62
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:55,920
Q. What is your dating style?

63
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:00,420
I like it to be comfortable as friends.

64
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:04,560
I would like it to be passionate and excited also.

65
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,360
But at the same time, when you date someone,

66
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:10,480
it sometimes becomes closer than friends because you see each other more.

67
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:15,880
So I prefer more comfortable and intimate dating style.

68
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:19,080
To be honest,

69
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:22,220
I’ve been thinking of some romantic relationship

70
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,400
that could be seen on TV show

71
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:28,460
So it made me wonder how it is like to be in a intimate and comfortable relationship.

72
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:33,320
Q. Do you tend to lead in the relationship?

73
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:38,760
Q. or do you tend to give in to another?

74
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:43,260
I would tend to give in as much as possible

75
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:46,420
when both has to compromise.

76
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:53,720
Do you have a specific taste in doing something or going somewhere together?

77
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:55,720
I don’t really.

78
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:58,960
I think if together, it would be happy to do

79
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,380
anything or go anywhere.

80
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:03,360
Even if I did not like it before, it would made me like it.

81
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:05,880
I was moved my his response.

82
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:13,080
‘If together, it would be happy to do anything or go anywhere.’

83
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:18,640
Q. What do you want to do the most if you have a boyfriend?

84
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:22,600
I would like to travel around with him.

85
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,180
A year before last year?

86
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:29,800
I’ve been to Osaka with my mother and grandmother

87
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,340
and thought it would’ve been nice to come

88
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:35,920
back again with my boyfriend.

89
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:38,800
So I thought of going away together if I have a boyfriend.

90
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:41,460
I also felt the same.

91
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:44,020
Most recent trip I’ve went to was

92
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:46,700
to Jeju island with my family.

93
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:51,540
I felt very jealous when seeing other couples traveling around.

94
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:53,920
I know. I’ve went to Jeju Island by myself.

95
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,600
I also felt very jealous of them.

96
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:56,600
Ah~

97
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:59,100
Q. After you argue with your girlfriend,

98
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:01,280
Q. how do you make it up?

99
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:03,380
You must talk first

100
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:07,260
to understand each other.

101
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:11,640
I try to meet her in person and talk to her about it.

102
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:15,260
I also feel the need of conversation right after the argument.

103
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:16,940
I know.

104
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:21,120
Also, I have a similar question to ask.

105
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:25,160
Do you tend to do what I do after argument?

106
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:28,460
Or is there anything else?

107
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:31,900
I am not sure if I have any specific skill to do that.

108
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:38,040
I really haven’t had any experience of reconciling after a big fight.

109
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:41,180
So you never had fought with someone?

110
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:44,480
I really haven’t had anything to fight with.

111
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:48,240
So no.

112
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:50,420
Aren’t you surprised?

113
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:52,280
It was surprising to me.

114
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:55,640
It is quite hard not to get upset about anything.

115
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:57,340
Even with friends.

116
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
So it makes her a bigger person

117
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:02,660
if she tends not to get upset on anyone or anything

118
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:07,780
by stepping out of the situation then communicating calmly.

119
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:15,120
Q. Do you go and introduce your girlfriend to your friends big and loudly?

120
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:19,420
Q. Or do you just keep it to yourself?

121
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:24,120
Up until now, I’ve been only telling it to my parents.

122
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:27,220
It got me thinking that

123
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:30,460
if I introduce my girlfriend to my friends

124
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:36,380
it would make me happy and my girlfriend happy.

125
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:40,780
I also think about those stuffs a lot.

126
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:44,220
It is very surprising.

127
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:46,160
Normally my friends

128
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:50,520
do not tell their parents about their relationship.

129
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:53,140
It got me surprised that you do that also.

130
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:58,340
Then how do you think of your boyfriend introducing yourself big and loudly?

131
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:02,400
I love it. I would like to see

132
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,100
his friends.

133
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,220
Ah…

134
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:12,960
Q. Lastly, how do you feel now?

135
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:15,660
I am very excited to see you.

136
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,880
I would like to turn back and see you.

137
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:19,700
Me too.

138
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:24,980
After listening to your responses,

139
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:27,480
it made me feel that we share a lot of things in similar,

140
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:30,180
so it was really fun to talk to you.

141
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:35,340
I also felt the same way.

142
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,580
Blind-Date Finished

143
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:42,700
Now it is a time to check each other out!

144
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:55,980
Hello

145
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:57,880
Hello nice to meet you.

146
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:59,180
Nice to meet you too.

147
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,440
What do I do?

148
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:04,720
It makes me so shy to talk to you face to face.

149
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:07,440
It was very fun to talk to you.

150
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,320
You too.

151
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:15,400
[Q. When you heard her voice for the first time, how was it?]
Her voice tone was a bit high,

152
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:19,360
and her pronunciation was very clear.

153
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,880
I liked it.

154
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:24,120
I liked his voice a lot.

155
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:27,920
Very organized tone?

156
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:32,120
[Q. (During Blind-Date) How do you feel?]
I thought it was a fix-up.

157
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:35,580
I felt so much in similarities in that sense.

158
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:39,140
During the blind date, I kept thinking ‘I know.’ ‘I am the same.’

159
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:42,640
It was hard for me to keep it down.

160
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:47,000
It made me want to talk to him more.

161
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:51,120
I know it is a blind date but we shared so many things in common.

162
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,960
It was like my friend who knows me so well.

163
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,180
But then after seeing her face to face

164
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:01,960
it made me want to talk to her once again.
