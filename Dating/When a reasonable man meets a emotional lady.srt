1
00:00:03,860 --> 00:00:05,860
How tall are you?

2
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:08,340
I am..

3
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:11,240
I also like to go to Hangang.

4
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:12,300
I am excited.

5
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:14,100
Me too..

6
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:29,680
&lt;When a reasonable man meets a emotional lady&gt;

7
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:34,020
[Jeon, Hyunji, 24 Years old, College Student]
I am thinking that

8
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:38,960
Q. This is your second blind date, how do you feel?
I could talk more having more confidence than the first time.

9
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:42,060
[Kim, Dongwoo, 25 Years Old, College Student]
I am very nervous.

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,100
Q. This is your second blind date, how do you feel?
I would like to have more things in common.

11
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:54,060
I also wish for 165CM height woman?

12
00:00:56,740 --> 00:00:59,620
Hello, I am Dongwoo Kim.

13
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:02,900
Hello, I am Hyunji Jeon.

14
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:03,600
Okay

15
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:04,960
Nice meeting you.

16
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:06,160
You too.

17
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:08,960
I would like to ask you a question first.

18
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:13,720
Q. Between staying in or going outside,

19
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:15,740
what do you prefer?

20
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:20,000
I prefer going out.

21
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:21,260
Oh really?

22
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:24,140
What do you do?

23
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:27,080
I do not like staying in.

24
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:33,680
So I go to café and read or watch a movie.

25
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,620
I do not like staying in.

26
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:40,380
I absolutely do not.

27
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:43,380
Q. What is your blood type?

28
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:44,760
I am A.

29
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:47,500
Do people tell you that you are a typical A?

30
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:50,360
No. they have hard time figuring out.

31
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:51,420
Ah really?

32
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:52,040
Yes.

33
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:55,020
You don’t sound like A.

34
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,400
So they have hard time figuring out.

35
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:02,860
I thought he is A, but he doesn’t sound like one.

36
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:04,980
I do not have a preference.

37
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:08,020
Type B guys are not good guys for me.

38
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:10,820
Q. What is your hobby?

39
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:15,340
I like to exercise

40
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:17,780
and go out to find delicious food.

41
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:22,540
Q. What is your hobby?

42
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:26,880
I also like to go out for exercise

43
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,120
I also like watching movies.

44
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:31,540
What kind of movie do you like?

45
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:36,020
I like thriller,

46
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:40,120
I like movies that make me think.

47
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:42,360
Who do you go to movie with?

48
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:46,140
Most of the time, I go

49
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:47,980
alone.

50
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:51,540
There is a movie theatre nearby my house so I go there by myself a lot.

51
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:59,720
Do you like eating food and going around for delicious food?

52
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,400
I like it very much.

53
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:09,520
So my friends ask me about good restaurants when they go out

54
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,180
Yes

55
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:11,140
they tend to ask me.

56
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:14,720
I love eating.

57
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:17,960
Q. Do you drink?

58
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:21,080
Yes I do.

59
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:28,640
but I like the atmosphere of it rather than drink itself.

60
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,700
Oh really?

61
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:33,480
Q. Do you like to drink?

62
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:36,560
and do you have drinking habit?

63
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:39,700
I like drinking

64
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:44,300
but I try to keep it down.

65
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:48,160
I do not have a specific drinking habit

66
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:50,000
but I get really high

67
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,180
when drinking

68
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:55,020
I become talkative and so on?

69
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:56,220
I think that is it.

70
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:57,720
I am like that too.

71
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:04,920
If you don’t go to those engagements, you do not get to see friends a lot.

72
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:06,440
Isn’t that hard for you to not go and meet?

73
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:10,740
It is not like I absolutely do not go there

74
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:14,620
but I go there but I leave early.

75
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:18,760
It is hard for me to leave early when I am in that circle.

76
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:19,840
You are very well-managed.

77
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,320
I know, that is the hardest part.

78
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:26,140
She seems to like

79
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,700
staying up till the end of the engagement.

80
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:37,440
But I do not prefer staying up till the end

81
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:41,040
every time.

82
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:43,520
It is no fun.

83
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:49,060
Q. What do you think is most important when dating?

84
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:58,840
I think it is important to talk to each other a lot of things

85
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:02,760
and be supportive for each other.

86
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:05,060
Ah~

87
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:07,500
Q. What is considered most important

88
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:09,380
when seeing a woman?

89
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:14,520
For the appearance, I am pretty tall so

90
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:20,580
I like a girl with certain height

91
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,480
For the personality,

92
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:28,560
I like a girl with active spirit.

93
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:31,080
Also I would like to talk to her well.

94
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:38,580
I would love to meet someone who likes small talk.

95
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,740
Do you prefer a specific type for appearance?

96
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:46,360
I do not have the strict limit for the height.

97
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:51,280
But I have a preference in height.

98
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,120
Something like that.

99
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:54,920
Aha

100
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:57,780
Q. How tall are you, may I ask?

101
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:01,240
Haha, I am 160CM

102
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:02,340
Ah you are 160CM.

103
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:03,420
Yes,

104
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:05,200
Ah~

105
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:09,340
My parents are pretty tall

106
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:14,480
but I am relatively short so my parents were always wondering about my height.

107
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,640
Yes…

108
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:20,260
Q. Do you consider yourself to be reasonable?

109
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:22,880
or emotional?

110
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:25,480
I am very reasonable.

111
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:31,240
I do not make a decision based on my feeling.

112
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:33,880
Absolutely not.

113
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:35,860
I am pretty much reasonable.

114
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:37,460
Uhm

115
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:41,660
I tend to get really emotional

116
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:44,660
So if boyfriend is also emotional

117
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:49,580
then it would be harder for both to keep it up.

118
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:52,220
I would like to meet a reasonable person

119
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:55,400
to keep the balance of the relationship.

120
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:59,680
Q. How many times per week do you think is appropriate to meet?

121
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:10,340
I think once a week, I would spare entire day for my boyfriend.

122
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:12,340
Ah~

123
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:16,200
Q. What kind of date would you like to have

124
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:18,440
with your girlfriend?

125
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:24,420
I would like to spend time doing usual stuffs.

126
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:27,140
I would go to have some foods,

127
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,120
talk for hours in café,

128
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:42,280
or go to Hangang and enjoy the view.

129
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:45,300
I also love going to Hangang.

130
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:46,620
Oh really?

131
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:51,800
Q. Do you appeal to someone you like?

132
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:57,180
It would depend on how we met.

133
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
If we met on blind date,

134
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:05,140
I appeal my feeling to him actively.

135
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:07,280
If we like each other,

136
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:12,620
and we do not play the game,

137
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:16,620
I prefer that much better.

138
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:18,220
PD: How about you?

139
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,980
If I like that person, I go up to her and appeal my feeling very clearly.

140
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:25,040
Q. Would you date someone on the first day you’ve met?

141
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:29,000
If it is a person I really like,

142
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:33,360
and I think this is the one,

143
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:38,380
I can date her on the first day.

144
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:40,860
I haven’t had that experience though.

145
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,580
I like that side of him

146
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:50,020
I didn’t move further close to him because

147
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,880
the conversation did not flow that well.

148
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,220
PD: How do you feel?

149
00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:56,700
I am excited.

150
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:57,700
I am also excited.

151
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:01,720
I don’t think I can speak if I see him in face to face.

152
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:07,000
Blind-Date Finished

153
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,940
Now it is a time to check each other out!

154
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:21,100
Hello

155
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:22,320
Nice to meet you.

156
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:27,340
What do I say?

157
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:31,640
I am not sure what to say when face to face, are you too?

158
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:32,460
Yes.

159
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:35,540
Are you normally not that talkative?

160
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:36,180
Me?

161
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:40,520
I need some time to feel comfortable enough to talk to newly acquainted person.

162
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:42,040
Ah~ you do.

163
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:49,080
Q. (During Blind-Date) How do you feel?
Our conversation did not flow well.

164
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:52,260
Our conversation did not flow well.

165
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:54,400
That was unfortunate.

166
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:57,980
For this time, I also found a lot of things in common

167
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:02,020
but the conversation did not flow well.

168
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:07,520
Q. How do you feel after checking each other out?
I could feel that she is small from her voice.

169
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:10,520
I could feel that she is small from her voice.

170
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:13,100
His first impression?

171
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:14,540
He is tall.

172
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:20,400
I expected him to be very serious, older brother like,

173
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:24,820
but after I see him, it didn’t give me that

174
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:29,260
much of older brotherly impression.

175
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:31,440
Um, how do I put it,

176
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:34,860
I did not find that excitement.

177
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:36,220
Something like that.

178
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,980
It is like cute little sister.
