00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:09,680
Which kind are you?

3
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:12,400
Why don’t you answer?

4
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:14,440

Okay.

Okay.

I practice those.

27
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:33,300
In my case,

28
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:37,840
I am thinking of doing leather arts

29
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:41,060
to avoid some boredom from work.

30
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:45,120
So I am looking around what I should try for.

31
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:46,320

Also your favorite actors or actresses?

39
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:08,580
I do not have a preference on genres.

40
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:11,060
I really love watching movies.

41
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:14,020
I used to watch two movies a day

42
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:19,380
in media rooms of my college library between classes.

43
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:22,020
Do you have a favorite actor or actress?

44
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:24,040
My favorite is Natalie Portman.

45
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:26,000

46
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,080
Ah yes.

47
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:32,780

48
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:36,180
I think they are cute.

49
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:39,680
Maybe cats and dogs?

50
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:42,660
Your favorite animal is a dog?

51
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,740
I like tiger too.

52
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,340
I like lions.

00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:49,440
Ah~

54
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:51,780
I love animals.

00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:55,680
I love pictures of lion,

56
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:58,880

Don’t you mean beef?

60
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:06,380
Yes. I like them as animals,

61
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:08,540
because their eyes are very clear.

62
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:09,440
Hmm

63
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,900
Q. Do you have any celebrity look-alike?

64
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:17,360
It seems inappropriate to tell you that here.

65
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:20,560
Is it a person? Or non-person?

66
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:21,580
He is a person.

67
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:22,260
Ah

68
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:24,740
Why not?

69
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,140
I will Kakaotalk you later.

70
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:29,400
Ah~ yes.

71
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:31,300
It makes me wonder.

72
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,780
I have been told as a lookalike some times.

73
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:35,720
Sang Yun Lee? (Korean Actor)

74
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,300
I am sorry.

75
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:42,180
Me?

76
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:47,080
So Hyun Kim? Known as child actress?

77
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:49,640
I have been told her as a lookalike.

78
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,960
Q. Who is your favorite singer?

79
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:55,760
I like Hip-hop singers.

80
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:56,680
Ah~

81
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:00,200
E-sense,

82
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:05,080
I also like ‘Nucksal’.

83
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:07,760
You must like ‘Show Me the Money’

84
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:09,600
The show is quite interesting.

85
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,440
I am also a big fan of it.

86
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:14,860
I hope they make it two seasons every year.

87
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:20,220
Q. Do you go to Karaoke?

88
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:21,400
Ah~ Yes.

89
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:24,260
Do you rap?

90
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:25,360
Rapping?

91
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:27,400
When I am excited?

92
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:30,520
I only do it when with closest friends.

93
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:33,720
I wonder how you would rap.

94
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:35,820
I am bad at it.

95
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:40,800
I practice at home looking at the lyrics

96
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:41,560
before I go to Karaoke and rap.

97
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:42,760
Do you practice at home?

98
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:43,480
Yes.

99
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:47,460
She likes Hip-Hop.

100
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:51,260
So I thought we might listen to the same music and talk about it.

101
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:56,940
I could imagine her practicing rap at home.

102
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:58,220
It made me laugh.

103
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:03,680
Q. They say there are bad guys and good guys.

104
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:07,520
Which kind are you?

105
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,160
I am a very good guy.

106
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:13,100
Ah~ You are quite sure about that.

107
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:13,880
Yes

108
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:16,500
I think I am a real good guy.

109
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:18,920
Ah really? What makes you think that?

110
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,120
I am born good.

111
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:22,640
You must be very good to others then.

112
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:23,500
Yes.

113
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:25,340
Being a good guy means

114
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,280
that you do not play a game

115
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,200
Ah~

116
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:32,580
and you adjust to others’ needs

117
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:33,660
I am that kind of guy.

118
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:36,380
He sounds like a good guy.

119
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:38,120
(My type) is bad guy who is good?

120
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:41,980
I need to get both.

121
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:43,380
Bad guy who is good.

122
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:46,040
Q. What is your blood type?

123
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:47,280
I am O.

124
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:48,740
Ah~

125
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:50,200
What is yours?

126
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,200
Mine?

127
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:53,120
What do you think?

128
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:53,960
A

129
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:55,120
Why?

130
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:56,940
A is most populated.

131
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:58,800
Ah~ I am not.

132
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,060
I am AB.

133
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:01,580
Mhm, AB

134
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:07,340
So your personality suits to the standard O?

135
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:09,300
I am very active

136
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:11,240
and like gathering with friends,

137
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:13,360
What is AB like?

138
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:18,680
I’ve heard that AB is very attractive blood type.

139
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:20,840
You are attractive?

140
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:24,260
Yes. We are unpredictable.

141
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:26,640
Unpredictable..

142
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:28,240
That type of blood type?

143
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,740
You have that kind of character.

144
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:32,720
Active and bright

145
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:36,560
Those are attractive styles.

146
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:39,480
I like to find something not predictable.

147
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:43,980
I think type O guys fitted me well.

148
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,800
Q. What is your hobby?

149
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:53,440
Q. For example, do you like to exercise?

150
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:59,100
or visit some quiet places like forest

151
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:02,120
and rest?

152
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,340
I like them both.

153
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:11,740
For my case, I like to go to places I could rest for vacation,

154
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:15,900
and for the normal weekend, I do outdoor activity.

155
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:17,820
For example,

156
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:20,440
I play basketball in the team.

157
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,340
You play basketball?

158
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:23,080
Yes.

159
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:26,460
I play basketball

160
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:30,180
I started surfing at Yangyang

161
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:33,080
2 years ago.

162
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,900
So you like to exercise?

163
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:37,160
I love playing sports.

164
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:38,380
I also like to exercise.

165
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:43,220
For vacation, I like to rest.

166
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:46,540
But normally I do acitivies.

167
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:47,820
Aha~

168
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:51,520
Q. What is your vacation type?

169
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,500
For me

170
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:58,120
I do not like scheduled tourism

171
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:00,220
where you visit 3~4 travel spots.

172
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:02,960
If I were to travel,

173
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,680
I set up for a long term schedule

174
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:08,840
so I could feel like I am living there.

175
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:12,200
I like to see one place for a long time.

176
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:16,060
I also love to travel in a long term.

177
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:19,520
If this does not fit well with each other,

178
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:21,300
it is very hard to accommodate.

179
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:26,920
So you’ve been to some resort towns?

180
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:31,920
Last year, I’ve been to Bali for surfing.

181
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:32,480
Wow

182
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:34,020
It is a good place for a rest.

183
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:36,400
I surf at day and rest at night.

184
00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:37,920
Oh~

185
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:40,220
For my case,

186
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:44,720
I do not like being sent to one to another very quickly.

187
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:47,340
This fitted well with her style.

188
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:52,600
I was surprised that our style for travel fitted well.

189
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:56,860
Normally people go here and there

190
00:08:56,860 --> 00:08:59,380
when they are travelling.

191
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:03,260
Producer: Is there any place you would like to visit with your boyfriend?

192
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:04,940
Bali?

193
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:13,660
I really wonder

194
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:16,700
so I would like to turn around and see you.

195
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:19,700
Me too.

196
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:22,100
I want to turn around.

197

Blind-Date Finished

198
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:30,560
Now it is a time to check each other out!

199
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:42,620
Hello

200
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:46,140
It is so awkward.

201
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,000
Nice to meet you.

202
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,700
Where do you live?

203
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:53,960
It’s been a month since I left Busan.

204
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,260
I am from Busan.

205
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:57,900
Oh really?

206
00:09:57,900 --> 00:09:58,920
I came to Seoul when I was 20 years old.

207
00:09:58,920 --> 00:09:59,840
For real?

208
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:02,440
But you look like you are from Seoul.

209
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:03,340
Maybe because How I talk?

210
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:04,280
Yes

211
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:08,200
Q. (During Blind-Date) How do you feel?
His voice was good.

212
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:12,720
He seems like a good guy.

213
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:16,180
Her voice sounded very young.

214
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:18,520
I thought it was cute.

215
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:22,600
We’ve had a lot of things in common.

216
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:26,820
It was neutral.

217
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:31,140
Q. How do you feel after checking each other out?
His images I thought of before seeing him

218
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:34,780
and after seeing him were similar.

219
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:38,100
He looked like what I’ve imagined of.

220
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:42,380
He had wide shoulder and looked like a grown-up.

221
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:44,060
She is pretty.

222
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:45,880
Wow she is pretty.

223
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,000
I liked it.
