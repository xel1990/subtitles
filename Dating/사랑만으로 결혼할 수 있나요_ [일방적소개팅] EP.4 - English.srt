Where does that thought process even come from?

We gathered a group of 20 people to participate in a blind date

LOL it’s not that

And I actually don’t care either way, but

00:01:42,352 --> 00:01:45,146
Usually when you talk to someone you look at their eyes

Rather than their body, right?

27
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:49,400

You said you’re not the type to show off,

00:02:34,737 --> 00:02:35,864
Yeah that’s true

43
00:02:35,905 --> 00:02:38,032

00:02:41,369 --> 00:02:44,747

I’d probably tease him, in the beginning

But if it gets to the point where it’s bothering me or stressing me out,

48
00:02:50,503 --> 00:02:52,630
then I don’t think I could keep dating him

Even if I really love someone and want to be with him forever,

if I don’t have money saved up, I don’t think I can afford the marriage

I want to make a differentiation between ideals and reality

Okay, realistically.

132
00:06:40,316 --> 00:06:44,612
I think we were on a similar thought process, but ended up with different conclusions

133
00:06:44,612 --> 00:06:46,989
I’m not talking about unconditional or blind love,

134
00:06:46,989 --> 00:06:49,450
but in order for you to get to feeling ‘love’ towards the other person, most people have check lists in their minds

135
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:51,119
but in order for you to get to feeling ‘love’ towards the other person, most people have check lists in their minds

136
00:06:51,119 --> 00:06:54,831
and that check list might contain finances, personality, whatever.

137
00:06:54,831 --> 00:06:56,332
and the fact that I love that person already means that person proved herself and checked off those boxes

138
00:06:56,332 --> 00:06:59,710
and the fact that I love that person already means that person proved herself and checked off those boxes

139
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:02,171
so I think it would be fine to get married

140
00:07:02,171 --> 00:07:04,924
If I were to get married when I’m not financially stable,

141
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:09,429
it might be fine for me and my partner, but what if we have a child?

142
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:12,974
I would ask myself, would the child be happy, too?

If a couple is in that situation,

144
00:07:15,309 --> 00:07:18,104
I think it’s better to not get married and just live together

00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:23,776

I think I would choose to work, even without considering the finances

177
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:48,528
Because I love my career

178
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:52,031
What if your wife loves her career just as much as you do?

179
00:08:52,573 --> 00:08:54,492
Would you consider..?

180
00:08:56,118 --> 00:08:56,911
Then I’d probably give up

181
00:08:58,037 --> 00:09:01,582
I would probably still stand my ground

182
00:09:01,874 --> 00:09:03,417
but if that conflict persists

183
00:09:03,417 --> 00:09:05,753
it might be better if I yield

184
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:07,797
in the very end.

185
00:09:08,172 --> 00:09:08,839
Ultimately?

186
00:09:08,839 --> 00:09:10,216
Yeah, ultimately

187
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:11,050
it'd probably be like that

188
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:12,969
but that ultimately will be after a very very long time

189
00:09:12,969 --> 00:09:16,305
Kinda like Lee Bong-ju style, you know the marathoner?

190
00:09:16,305 --> 00:09:17,098
Like a marathon

191
00:09:17,098 --> 00:09:18,808
Gotton run that marathon

192
00:09:20,069 --> 00:09:22,219
[Final Decision]

193
00:09:23,437 --> 00:09:25,356
You’re like the MC over here

194
00:09:25,632 --> 00:09:28,167
Send O or X…

195
00:09:33,864 --> 00:09:35,491
This is a little uncomfortable

196
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:38,452
No running away without saying a word after the shoot

197
00:09:40,705 --> 00:09:43,708
How was it for you? I was really nervous because I’ve never done anything like this before

198
00:09:44,292 --> 00:09:46,919
We talked about a lot of things that we wouldn’t in a normal blind date

199
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:49,046
We talked about a lot of things that we wouldn’t in a normal blind date

200
00:09:49,046 --> 00:09:51,132
We talked about a lot of things that we wouldn’t in a normal blind date

201
00:09:51,132 --> 00:09:55,177
I enjoyed talking about those topics, as well as listening to your views

202
00:09:55,177 --> 00:09:58,806
Some parts we really vibed well, and some parts not so much,

203
00:09:58,806 --> 00:10:01,976
but all in all, it was a good experience.
