1
00:00:03,380 --> 00:00:05,700
Are you into K Pop idols or celebrities?

2
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:11,360
I am really into dancing so I like BTS, BtoB.

3
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:14,740
So you like EXO?

4
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:30,740
&lt;When Yonsei Queen who loves EXO meets Boy Fan of EXO&gt;

5
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:37,440
[Lee, Hyung Song, 22 Years old, college student]
Conversation from the last date did not go that well.

6
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:40,920
Q. How do you feel about joining for the second blind date?
But for this time,

7
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:44,680
I would like to meet someone whom I could really talk to.

8
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:47,320
Uhm,

9
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:51,220
I like someone with warm-hearted look.

10
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:54,440
I would like him to be that one.

11
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,500
For this time,

12
00:00:57,580 --> 00:01:01,280
[Park, Ji Won, 24 Years Old, College Studnet]
I expect it to be excited rather than being comfortable.

13
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:04,440
Then I would like to have a nice conversation with her.

14
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:06,480
Hello

15
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:07,840
Hello

16
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:10,600
How was your trip to here?

17
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:12,880
It was okay.

18
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:15,620
I took a bus.

19
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:21,600
Okay then, I would like to ask you a question first.

20
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:26,680
Q. What have you been doing lately?

21
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:31,120
Currently, my semester is on so

22
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:35,040
I go to school for classes.

23
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:38,080
What year are you on?

24
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:40,860
I am junior.

25
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,300
I am also junior.

26
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:43,960
Ah~

27
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:45,600
Q. What is your major?

28
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,560
My major is Chemical Engineering

29
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,640
Ah~

30
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:51,260
What is yours?

31
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:56,120
Uhm it is named as Biotechnology but

32
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:59,940
it is simply known as Bioengineering.

33
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:02,500
Oh, I am also Chemical and Bioengineering.

34
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:03,540
Oh really?

35
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:05,640
We have some similarities.

36
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:08,480
We probably have similar classes.

37
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:12,720
Q. What do you do when staying at home?

38
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,520
I watch TV a lot

39
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,580
I tend to be relaxed by lying down most of the time.

40
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:28,220
Then do you go out with your family in the weekend?

41
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:32,720
My mother likes me to go out with her.

42
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:35,300
Do you have any sibling?

43
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:39,400
I have a younger brother who is a year younger than me.

44
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:43,180
I can picture a happy family.

45
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,360
I am very close to my family,

46
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,220
compared to others.

47
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:50,440
I am also close to my family

48
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:51,860
Ah~

49
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:55,960
So I found that to be similar.

50
00:02:56,840 --> 00:03:00,340
Q. Do you prefer going outside

51
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:03,240
or staying in?

52
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:07,960
I prefer going out and being quiet.

53
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:09,460
Huh?

54
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:11,540
Maybe going to some quiet places?

55
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:15,200
Yes, I go to café by myself a lot.

56
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,120
I have also done a lot of activities within college

57
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:21,300
I tend to attend the mandatory meetings.

58
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,820
At the same time, I spend my spare time

59
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:26,700
going to café alone or shopping alone

60
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:28,540
or going to a movie by myself.

61
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:30,920
This has been more often than going to the meeting with other people.

62
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,840
I also prefer being alone quietly.

63
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:37,780
So if the boyfriend is active and outgoing,

64
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:40,020
and wants to go out to crowded places,

65
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,460
that would cause a problem

66
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:45,260
when actually dating.

67
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:47,980
I thought that matched my taste.

68
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:52,320
Q. What is your dating style?

69
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:56,700
I prefer friend-like dating style.

70
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,760
Uhm

71
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:05,680
It is hard to put it on a word.

72
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:08,500
Being comfortable when together style?

73
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,120
Ah..

74
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:14,280
Q. When was the last time you’ve dated?

75
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:17,860
It was a year and two months ago.

76
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:20,820
It has been some time.

77
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:31,740
Q. How much is adequate for dating costs per month?

78
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:36,920
I really haven’t thought about the cost.

79
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:41,960
But I do feel as a burden if a guy

80
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:44,720
tries to handle all the stuffs by himself

81
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:46,820
and feels pressure on him.

82
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:52,160
For example, if a guy pays for the dinner

83
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,460
a girl could buy a desert.

84
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:58,740
‘You are a guy so handle all by yourself’ is

85
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,100
pressuring me more.

86
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:06,980
Q. How much do you think is adequate for dating costs per month?

87
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:14,660
I live in Seoul by myself and handle all the living costs by myself.

88
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:18,300
I do not spend much on myself,

89
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:21,400
but I spare a lot for my girlfriend.

90
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:26,860
Q. What kind of hobby do you like to share with your boyfriend?

91
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:29,480
It is not much of hobby

92
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:34,720
but I would like to go around and find delicious food.

93
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:37,920
Do you have any likes and dislikes?

94
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,620
I do not have any specific for that.

95
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,660
I do eat all kinds of food.

96
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,440
Do you like cilantro?

97
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,700
Cilantro? Ah~

98
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:48,860
I have been quite shocked after having cilantro.

99
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:50,780
I also do not prefer cilantro.

100
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:52,280
Me too.

101
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:55,740
Q. How do you feel about long distance relationship?

102
00:05:56,460 --> 00:06:00,020
Let’s say it is hard to meet up at Ilsan.

103
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,680
Before living in Seoul,

104
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:04,260
I thought Gyeongi-Do and Seoul are same thing.

105
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,900
So you don’t mind the distance?

106
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:10,660
Ilsan is not that far.

107
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:16,840
If I like, I prefer to go to where she lives.

108
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:20,120
That answer seems to be telling me

109
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:23,540
that distance doesn’t matter.

110
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:25,140
‘Of course I can come to Ilsan.’

111
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:28,460
I could hear that from his answer.

112
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:31,780
So I liked his response.

113
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:35,020
Q. If two people get into a trouble,

114
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:38,560
what do you think is the good resolution strategy?

115
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:40,940
If I get upset about something,

116
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:45,420
it is hard for me to say it right away.

117
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:48,700
I think about it in my head, not getting upset about it,

118
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:51,260
then it grew inside and gets me upset,

119
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:54,100
then I tell him about it.

120
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:59,820
So you just hold it in then tell it away all at once?

121
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:08,040
I do not tell him about every single thing that makes me mad.

122
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:12,320
If it has been 5 times, then I would tell him I got mad 2 times.

123
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:14,460
or something like that.

124
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:16,080
Uhm…

125
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:21,760
I would like her to tell me every time.

126
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:24,760
If it is not a big thing,

127
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:28,780
you could just mention it then have a conversation about it.

128
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:32,220
You could adjust some things to each other.

129
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:35,260
I would think that it is better than not telling it every time.

130
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:36,800
Q. If you are dating,

131
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:39,760
are you the type to adjust

132
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:43,200
or to make her adjust?

133
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:46,420
I prefer to adjust myself to her.

134
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:52,380
Man and Woman are different.

135
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:57,460
I adjust by thinking of that difference when dating.

136
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:02,300
Then let’s say, you fought with your girl friend,

137
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:04,760
and it is clearly her fault,

138
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:08,640
would you still apologize or get mad at her?

139
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:10,720
You said it is her fault.

140
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:11,980
Yes.

141
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:18,440
Uhm, then how about 80% of it is her fault?

142
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:21,080
Ah…

143
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:24,000
I wouldn’t get mad about it right away.

144
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:29,040
I would meet up with her and have a face to face conversation.

145
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:31,180
It would make a huge difference.

146
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:34,500
I would ask her one by one.

147
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:36,400
I liked that side of him.

148
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:37,640
Uhm

149
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:42,280
To be honest, I am not the giving-in type.

150
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:44,700
So it would cause a lot of fights,

151
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:46,460
if both are like that.

152
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:49,020
I am not asking him to adjust everything to me

153
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:52,420
but if he tends to give in to me

154
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,760
it would cause less fight.

155
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:01,440
Q. Is there any specific moment or experience

156
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:05,600
that makes you feel ‘Ah he is the one for me.’?

157
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:08,100
I tend to like someone

158
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:09,560
who is good to me.

159
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:14,180
I don’t like playing game.

160
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:17,180
I like someone who

161
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:18,760
continues to be good to me.

162
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:21,660
My mind grows upon him.

163
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:26,900
If you like someone, do you go up to him actively?

164
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,860
If I like this guy very much,

165
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:33,260
I would go for it actively

166
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:36,900
I do not think that it is awkward for a girl to go up to a guy first.

167
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:41,160
I have never seen any girl coming up to me first.

168
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:43,400
Most of time, I’ve went up to them first.

169
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:48,260
So I felt interested in when she mentioned going up to a guy actively.

170
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:52,220
then I moved closer to her right away.

171
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:58,680
Q. Do you like to tell other people when dating?

172
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:03,080
I am not ‘In a relationship’ status on Facebook type of girl.

173
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:06,820
I obviously tell my close personal friends

174
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:11,020
but do not go up to them and say ‘I have a boyfriend’

175
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:13,280
loud and clear.

176
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:15,540
Most of my friends would know so

177
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:17,640
I do not feel the need to tell them.

178
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:21,220
I have been hiding since.

179
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:24,560
So if I date this time,

180
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:31,660
I’ve thought of opening it up widely.

181
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:34,900
Q. If a boyfriend lives an hour ride away,

182
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:37,780
saying that he wants to see you a lot,

183
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:41,020
but you’ve got only an hour, would you let him come?

184
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:44,760
You are saying if he comes to Ilsan, and ask me to come out,

185
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:45,980
I would go out or not?

186
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:48,740
It took him an hour to get there,

187
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:49,900
see you for an hour

188
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:51,480
and go back taking an hour.

189
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:54,120
I would just go out to see him.

190
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:59,240
I wouldn’t go out if I ought not to

191
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:01,140
but he came to see me taking an hour ride,

192
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:05,960
it is not nice for him if I ask him to go back.

193
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:08,020
Okay I see.

194
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,240
Are you a fan of any idols or celebrity?

195
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:17,380
Ah to be honest, I like boy groups.

196
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:18,660
Ah really?

197
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:19,840
Who do you like?

198
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,780
I like to dance so

199
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:25,140
I like BTS, BtoB,

200
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:27,240
and etc.

201
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:28,860
Ah..

202
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:32,180
I am not that into girl groups.

203
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:35,280
I like those who could dance well.

204
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:38,660
For example EXO or etc.

205
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:41,340
Ah really?

206
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:45,200
So then if your girlfriend likes celebrity,

207
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,560
how would you feel?

208
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,040
If she visits their company office,

209
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:52,620
or she goes to see their performance on stage

210
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:56,140
Wow you are familiar with the words!

211
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:58,960
I have been interested in those things

212
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:01,120
so it is okay for me,

213
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:04,920
but it would surprise me if she goes frequently.

214
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:08,360
Let say there is a concert,

215
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:11,500
if she asks you to buy a ticket together, would you?

216
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:12,780
Of course I would.

217
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:13,500
Oh really?

218
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:14,300
Yes.

219
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:15,780
I would go to PC café if it needs.

220
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:24,700
Q. Do you like music festival like UMF?

221
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:29,740
Uhm, I do not prefer EDM, is it correct?

222
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:32,780
I don’t like too crowded places.

223
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:34,780
I prefer to stay at home

224
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:38,040
because I do not like crowded and loud places.

225
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:39,080
Ah I see.

226
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:41,100
But if my boyfriend asks me to go,

227
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:43,360
I wouldn’t say no to that

228
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:45,660
but I wouldn’t enjoy myself

229
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:47,660
going to those festivals

230
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:51,040
Then you wouldn’t hide your feelings if you go.

231
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:53,060
Huh? No, not really.

232
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,560
It would be too loud for you.

233
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:56,280
Ah I do not hate it that much.

234
00:12:58,020 --> 00:13:00,440
It would make you happy if boyfriend asks you to go to EXO concert.

235
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:03,380
If he obtains a ticket, yes

236
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:07,860
Okay, I see.

237
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:14,800
Blind-Date Finished

238
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:18,380
Now it is a time to check each other out!

239
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:32,000
-Hello

240
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:32,800
-Hello
-Hello

241
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:37,920
What should I say?

242
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:41,860
Ah ..you are really

243
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:44,540
never mind.

244
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:45,860
What? Why?

245
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,120
Never mind.

246
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:49,980
Junior?

247
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:50,800
Yes.

248
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:57,720
So you are in engineering?

249
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:00,420
Yes.

250
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:02,320
Ah..

251
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,760
Aren’t you in engineering too?

252
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:04,620
Yes I am.

253
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:07,420
You must be very famous around school.

254
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:09,100
Not really.

255
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:14,440
Q. (During Blind-Date) How do you feel?
I thought she was quiet and calming style.

256
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:19,380
but she was fluent

257
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:22,820
telling her stories well.

258
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:25,480
So I think I could talk to her well.

259
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:27,520
When I asked him a question

260
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:32,980
he mentioned more deeply than I’ve expected.

261
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:36,140
So that made me to talk to him well.

262
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:42,300
Q. After checking each other, how do you feel?
Appearance is not my priority,

263
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:47,260
but thought she was very pretty.

264
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:51,100
To be really honest, when I first met him,

265
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:54,020
I didn’t have ‘Oh I really like him’ feeling.
