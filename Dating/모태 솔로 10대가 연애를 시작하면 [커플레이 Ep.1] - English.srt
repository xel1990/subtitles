To see what's different from 20s relationship(date)

14
00:00:32,305 --> 00:00:38,100
React about when 20s see teenagers date

15
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:40,340

16
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:41,305

00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:35,460
They don't ask name each other, even they are meet first time

36
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:36,360
So cute

37
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:38,100
Is it coed?

38
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:40,060
My school is coeducational.

39
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:41,540
We are boys high school.

40
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:42,740
Really?

41
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,140

00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:52,240

57
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:25,980
Sae Hee is older than Ho Joon

58
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:28,980
Oh no, Sae her will ask phone number I guess

59
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:29,780
I think so too

60
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:31,140
Nuna...!

61
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:33,720
I thought we are same age...!

62
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:41,905
I born in 2001... so our age difference is only 1 year

63
00:02:41,905 --> 00:02:45,020
I'm still older than you wow...

64
00:02:45,595 --> 00:02:46,595
Younger boyfriend is hot topic now

65
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:48,320
Why? since when?

66
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:49,920
You don't see the drama "Pretty Oppa bought meal"(wrong)

67
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,280
Oh no not oppa, Nana

68
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,460
hahaha Nuna is correct

69
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:59,445
Have you ever been on a blind date?

70
00:02:59,445 --> 00:03:03,500
Not blind date... Introduce a friend's friend something like that

71
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:06,780
We call it like that too

72
00:03:06,785 --> 00:03:07,975
How about you?

73
00:03:08,455 --> 00:03:09,935
No...

74
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:14,380
I did, because my school weren't coed.

75
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:16,700
I don't like blind dates.

76
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:17,820
Me either

77
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:19,560
Awkward

78
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:22,000
Right... uncomfortable with agent too

79
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,040
Get more exciting

80
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,200
How many times have you been couple?

81
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:28,980
None...

82
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:31,300
A person who has never been in a romantic relationship

83
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:34,300
May I ask you...?

84
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:36,300
What? me? (Yes you...)

85
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:39,800
Let's not ask each other.

86
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:41,940
It's hurt my mind

87
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,180
Sae Hee has no boyfriend before

88
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:48,100
Then, I'm possible to win because she might hard to ask phone number

89
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:49,620
because too shy

90
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:53,200
Add sugar to them

91
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:56,740
That is so pretty

92
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:58,480
cloud smoothie

93
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:05,040
Cloude smoothie is very sweet like teenager

94
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,040
Couple quest is arrive

95
00:04:08,125 --> 00:04:09,425
Open it?

96
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:15,820
Open quest letter carefully

97
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:21,360
write Buttket list for date (If I'm teenager couple)

98
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:23,300
Buttket list for date?

99
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:23,980
sigh*

100
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:24,520
I miss those days

101
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:26,520
Do you have anything in mind?

102
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:28,100
No...

103
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:29,320
Me either

104
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:32,240
It's not easy.

105
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:38,160
This can't be happen

106
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:41,260
I wanted to come home from school with in school uniform.

107
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:44,220
This can't be happen right?

108
00:04:44,495 --> 00:04:45,795
I need another one.

109
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:52,520
If I write that, I'll ask girlfriend to wait in front of school

110
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:55,480
And also I'll wait for her at front of her school

111
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:58,875
I went boy middle school, high school like Ho Joon

112
00:04:58,875 --> 00:05:01,675
I don't know who's in front of the school, but there's a girl waiting!

113
00:05:01,675 --> 00:05:03,545
then, Everyone panic

114
00:05:03,545 --> 00:05:06,760
If boy friend hold her hand, then boys are shouting!

115
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:08,820
20s happy with their imagination

116
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:12,600
Han river?

117
00:05:12,605 --> 00:05:13,645
I like Han river too

118
00:05:13,645 --> 00:05:15,645
Finally their hope were in agreement

119
00:05:17,425 --> 00:05:20,775
I can't go on the rides, but I like the amusement park mood

120
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:22,980
The night mood

121
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:32,880
Tell
or not?

122
00:05:34,755 --> 00:05:36,975
The couple ring

123
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:44,420
My classmates do a lot.

124
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:51,620
And couple shoes!

125
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:55,540
Friends do a lot too

126
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,520
What is your ideal type?

127
00:06:03,845 --> 00:06:05,915
What is your ideal type?

128
00:06:07,055 --> 00:06:10,015
A man who turtleneck suits him very well.

129
00:06:10,015 --> 00:06:13,385
turtleneck... then he should have... small head

130
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:19,080
ummm... I don't care about head size...

131
00:06:19,085 --> 00:06:22,260
just good at turtleneck clothing

132
00:06:22,265 --> 00:06:25,245
Maybe it's because of a celebrity.

133
00:06:25,245 --> 00:06:28,020
Yes, turtleneck is not pretty, celebrities are pretty

134
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,820
And the boy is not always wearing turtleneck how she know about it

135
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,000
You are realistic

136
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:33,140
How about you

137
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:34,640
My ideal type is short hair

138
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:36,540
Short hair?

139
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:38,540
I'm sorry

140
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:39,540
laugh or crying?

141
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:45,080
But that is just ideal type, It's not I hate other hair style

142
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:51,280
He leave a choice for Sae Hee

143
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:54,220
If you like blind date partner

144
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:56,920
Then say ideal type close to blind date partner

145
00:06:57,340 --> 00:06:59,660
change more like partner style

146
00:06:59,955 --> 00:07:02,375
Cute girl?

147
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,940
Kind and thoughtful girl

148
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,460
Kind and thoughtful girl with short hair?

149
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:08,520
celebrity ideal type?

150
00:07:09,135 --> 00:07:10,215
Red velvet Irene

151
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:12,080
Irene...?

152
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,060
Irene face and...

153
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:14,700
I like Boyoung Park too

154
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,760
His ideas are too extreme.

155
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:18,660
No one!

156
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:23,440
Same thing with girl, If go to college, we believe only good-looking guys everywhere

157
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:25,880
Teenager see appearance a lot

158
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:29,940
20s less care about that

159
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:31,700
right

160
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:36,420
20s think about 'are we fit mind together' more than appearance

161
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,520
Have the satisfaction of one's appearance

162
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:47,080
however If they are not fit about life values and personality, then they fight and part

163
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:48,800
Secon quest avrrived

164
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,320
Take selfie together

165
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,800
Take selfie together?

166
00:07:56,875 --> 00:07:58,325
What am I supposed to do?

167
00:08:05,255 --> 00:08:06,255
take photo with...

168
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:08,085

169
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:11,180

170
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,580

171
00:08:14,175 --> 00:08:15,355
I'm not good at taking selfie... sorry

172
00:08:18,725 --> 00:08:20,635
Cute

173
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:24,160
They shy to do this

174
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:38,900
What will be the end of the first date?

175
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:43,300
oh?! wait!

176
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:44,860
What is your phone number?

177
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:46,860
Sae Hee said it!

178
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:48,860
I knew it...!

179
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:52,440
They take selfie with Sae he's phone so, phone is already on the table

180
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:54,495
so naturally...

181
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,120
Sae hee ask about it

182
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:58,120
Penalty time!

183
00:08:58,560 --> 00:08:59,560
Let's get along well with each other.

184
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:01,000
thank you

185
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:07,620
Can Se Hee and Ho Jun get closer?

186
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,580
When I saw her first time

187
00:09:11,255 --> 00:09:13,585
Bright and

188
00:09:14,525 --> 00:09:17,355
active

189
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:19,740

When I know she is Nu na to me

191
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:24,260
I like that she is older than me

192
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:29,860
I want meet her more and want to learn about her

193
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:31,280
Because our age is different, I can learn from her

194
00:09:33,885 --> 00:09:34,885
She is good person

195
00:09:36,925 --> 00:09:37,925

00:09:38,245 --> 00:09:39,245

198
00:09:42,285 --> 00:09:45,275
When I know he is younger than me,

199
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:47,800
embarrassed

200
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:51,000
I can't imagine he is 17...

201
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:57,540
I think 17 is young, so I surprised!
