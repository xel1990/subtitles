1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,940
1,2,3

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:06,220
Hello

3
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:11,800
Hello

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,760
My name is Seo Dong-won

5
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:20,880
My name is Jeong Yu-rim

6
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:21,660
Yu-rim?

7
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:22,260
Yes, Yu-rim

8
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:26,080
Nice to meet you!

9
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:27,980
Shall we take a shot?

10
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:28,580
Sure

11
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:31,040
Cheers?

12
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:34,380
Nice to meet you!

13
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,200
Let’s draw the card.

14
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:47,960
‘Based only on the first impression, in what year did Yu-rim enter the University?’

15
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:49,140
Year 2014?

16
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:49,940
Nope

17
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:51,060
I’m wrong?

18
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:52,500
You should take a shot.

19
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:56,020
It’s year 2009.

20
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:58,880
Wow, you look so young

21
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:00,320
How old you are..?

22
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:01,400
28 years old

23
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:03,200
Oh is this..?

24
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:06,040
How old do I look?

25
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:07,860
Twenty-

26
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:08,920
Twenty-?

27
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:09,920
Five?

28
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:10,500
25?

29
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:11,220
I am pretty good right?

30
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:11,720
Yeah

31
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:12,780
You look really young.

32
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:15,660
Your skin looks so clean.

33
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:17,500
Even better than mine!

34
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:19,400
Not at all. Yours looks great.

35
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:20,400
It’s the make-up

36
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:24,320
Well your make-up doesn’t look that heavy

37
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:25,660
Slow-down cowboy.

38
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:28,100
Alcohol’s hitting me up today

39
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:29,220
Big time!

40
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,200
Why, what’s the question?

41
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:41,900
‘Which part does Yu-rim look at first when she sees a man?’

42
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:43,340
Maybe thighs?

43
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:46,840
Oh guess I should take a shot then

44
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:47,420
Please do

45
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:49,320
I look at guy’s hands a lot

46
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:50,000
Hands?

47
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:52,180
Yes, I like men with pretty hands

48
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:53,260
Mine are pretty

49
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,960
You say it so proudly!

50
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:56,960
Did the camera get it?

51
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,220
Actually my hands are huge

52
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:07,680
Aren’t they?

53
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:09,700
No, to be exact, mine was lower

54
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:11,220
Come on, if you’re being that technical

55
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:12,480
Yeah put it up there

56
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:13,720
Still it’s big

57
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:15,560
Don’t be ridiculous!

58
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,480
Why am I getting all the difficult ones?

59
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:23,540
‘What do you do when your girlfriend’s mad at you?’

60
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,260
Maybe you throw special events for her?

61
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:26,080
Wrong!

62
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:28,100
Isn’t it normal to do special events?

63
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:29,360
Is it?

64
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:32,680
I act cute for her

65
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:34,020
(Can you show us how?)

66
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:36,220
Like a role play?

67
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:37,300
A role play?

68
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:39,160
Let’s say you’re mad because I was late

69
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,620
How could you be late?

70
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:43,320
You know I waited

71
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,220
Can you look at my face?

72
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:47,200
I’m so sorry

73
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,400
I love you!

74
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:57,160
‘When Yu-rim likes a guy, she does a certain gesture what is it?’

75
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:59,000
I think you’ll smile a lot in front of that person

76
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:01,380
I usually look into his eyes a lot

77
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:02,200
Eye contact?

78
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:02,720
Yes

79
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:08,380
ah~

80
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:10,300
You know we made eye contact with each other

81
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:15,000
Sure we did

82
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:21,580
‘Dong-won prefers to date someone younger, same age, or older?’

83
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:22,900
Someone older?

84
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:24,900
Wow, you’re psychic!

85
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:26,300
Psychic?!

86
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:27,540
Then how about you

87
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:28,080
Take a guess

88
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:30,960
I’d wish you’d go for boys younger than you

89
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:33,100
Normally I prefer someone as my age or older

90
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:37,880
It’s a pressure for me to date younger guys

91
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:42,480
because I feel like I have to take care of the

92
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,280
but it can depend on the person

93
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:48,640
It’s not like a strict rule and if the person is nice, it wouldn’t matter

94
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:52,240
Well I am a nice person you know.

95
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,220
I wonder what it is.

96
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:02,740
‘Can Dong-won say “I love you” to his GF in front of his friends or not?’

97
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,140
I think you can!

98
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:05,080
Yes I can

99
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,100
I knew it.

100
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:08,160
Is it hard to say I love you?

101
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:10,160
I can’t do it.

102
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:10,660
Really?

103
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:11,560
In front of your friends?

104
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:14,960
Do you feel embarrassed?

105
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,320
It’s a cringy thing to do.

106
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:18,880
The thing is

107
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:19,840
if I don’t express

108
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:23,520
my feelings to my girlfriend she might see me as careless

109
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,520
And with my friends

110
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:28,620
I want them to know my GF is the best

111
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:29,800
I like your way of thinking

112
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:31,860
To let them know that she’s my top priority?

113
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:32,980
I want to be good to her

114
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:36,800
more than to my friends
I want to tell her my feelings often

115
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,540
Oh~~

116
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:40,920
interesting question.

117
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:47,740
Does Yu-rim prefer easy relationships like friends or a passionate romance?

118
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:49,100
The easy one?

119
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,400
I don’t want to be too comfortable.

120
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,820
I want to be special

121
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:56,120
and precious to that person

122
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:59,940
I’d like to be reminded that I’m being loved

123
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,240
You like being comfortable huh?

124
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:05,280
Do you fart or burp in front of your girlfriend?

125
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:07,320
I want her to do it right away, comfortably

126
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:10,000
My parents still don’t fart in front of each other

127
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,660
That was the environment I grew up in

128
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,240
Manners should be kept between loved ones.

129
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,460
I know how to keep them.

130
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:16,780
I have manners

131
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:18,200
By accident is fine

132
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:19,780
What about burping and going like, “Wanna smell it?”

133
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:20,480
No I hate that

134
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:21,440
I’m not like that!

135
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:30,640
Have you ever met a guy through social media? Yes or no?

136
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:33,080
I think it’s hard not to for you

137
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:35,060
What do you mean hard not to?

138
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:36,160
You’re very pretty so..

139
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,160
Are you on Instagram?

140
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,100
Yes

141
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:40,120
If you’re on it, that’s-

142
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:41,340
100% chance?

143
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:42,740
(sigh) I get it

144
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,000
Yes, I have

145
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I see

146
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,260
Have you?

147
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:50,240
I think you have

148
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,500
I haven’t

149
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:52,480
Really?

150
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:55,280
To meet people via social media,

151
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:57,160
I thought it’d be too casual

152
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:58,280
If that person DM'd me,

153
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:01,160
she might have DM'd another guy

154
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,820
I’m a bit uncomfortable about that

155
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:07,980
I was slightly against it

156
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:10,600
But...

157
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,380
if that person is really sincere

158
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:16,260
I could maybe give it a try

159
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:20,140
Oh this one is the last question

160
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:31,540
Seo Dong-won feels the same now as when he saw Yu-rim the first time? Or not?

161
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:35,840
The same

162
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:36,580
Yes, you’re right

163
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:37,500
Why is that?

164
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:41,740
My first impression of you was good because of your bright smile

165
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:44,180
Because of your smile

166
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:46,280
I had a feeling that you’re a nice person,

167
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:49,900
so yes your smile left me a good impression

168
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:54,040
Then....

169
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:57,580
Do you happen to have....

170
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:01,560
plan after this..?

171
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:05,320
…after this?

172
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:05,820
Plans?

173
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:09,140
Umm..

174
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:14,800
Let me get your number first.

175
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:16,980
I should have said that first

176
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:18,340
Ah I was so stupid!

177
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:20,020
I know! You should know better

178
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:21,100
What an idiot!

179
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:24,040
I had a great time today

180
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,360
I did too

181
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,120
After the wrap-up, we’ll see

182
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:39,660
‘When dong-won likes a girl,

183
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:41,660
He’ll smile and laugh a lot.”

184
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:46,000
I usually rub my neck or touch my ears

185
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,580
No wonder your hands were so still

186
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:48,280
Me?

187
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:50,280
Really?

188
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:53,500
We’ll have to see the video later to find that out.
