1
00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:02,140
Se-Hui
 
Ho-Jun

2
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:07,380
How are you?

3
00:00:07,420 --> 00:00:08,580
Yes

4
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:10,580
Thinking of going to school make my heart pound

5
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:12,580
I hate it

6
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:16,280
Today's Quest
Who will be the one who prepares a gift?

7
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:18,160
Should I choose first?

8
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:20,400
You go first

9
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:23,820
Se-hui will prepare it I think

10
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:27,360
It may be just me, but man is weak at choosing gifts

11
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:28,960
not knowing what to buy them

12
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:31,585
If we think about them choosing clothes last time

13
00:00:31,585 --> 00:00:33,140
He chose

14
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:34,140
so I think he will prepare

15
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:36,140
so you think he will?

16
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:38,140
yes

17
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:42,280
Their Date bucket list. Han-river date

18
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:44,880
be careful

19
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:46,880
They prepare picnic

20
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:56,700
Shall we eat chicken?

21
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:00,360
Really feels like being on a picnic

22
00:01:00,365 --> 00:01:03,335
These days people lend those kind of things

23
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:04,340
Tables and tent

24
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:13,380
Their first quest is?

25
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:16,800
Giving each other nicknames

26
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:20,735
giving nicknames?

27
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:22,240
It's really hard

28
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:24,240
What do you want to call your boyfriend if you have one?

29
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:26,120
What to call him?

30
00:01:26,615 --> 00:01:28,755
I never thought of it

31
00:01:29,335 --> 00:01:31,355
like this

32
00:01:32,665 --> 00:01:33,755
Then...

33
00:01:34,375 --> 00:01:36,215
What do you want to be called?

34
00:01:38,645 --> 00:01:39,925
I never thought of that too

35
00:01:40,905 --> 00:01:41,945
What about you?

36
00:01:42,815 --> 00:01:45,835
My name

37
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,560
Oh you like your name

38
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,560
Can they call each other name?

39
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:52,980
Let's try it

40
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:55,080
It maybe cheesy

41
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:57,900
It's not even easy

42
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:01,060
We were eating and this happens

43
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:06,060
You go first? or me?

44
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:07,340
I'll do it first

45
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:13,020
Wait... I can't do it

46
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:17,240
It's hard

47
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:21,300
can't help smiling

48
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:27,220
Let's make many good memories

49
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:28,620
Ho-Jun

50
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:30,620
She called his name

51
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,860
He can't even look at her eyes

52
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:37,080
I'm younger than you but take care of me

53
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:39,220
Se-hui

54
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,380
Did he just say Se-Hui?

55
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:48,500
Okay

56
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:51,320
I'm gonna call you "Hun"

57
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:53,320
Kind of like a dog name?

58
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:58,380
telling the truth game

59
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:01,380
rock paper scissor

60
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:04,020
then...

61
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:06,200
You go to coed school right?

62
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:10,600
Have you ever been proposed by someone?

63
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:13,100
Yes

64
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:18,700
Have you ever want it to date that person?

65
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:23,020
If I wanted I would have

66
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:24,640
then you didn't want to?

67
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:25,700
Yes I didn't

68
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:32,480
If he liked me I didn't like him

69
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,700
There are two kinds of people

70
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:43,400
One needs to love and the other needs to be loved

71
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,840
How about you?

72
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:47,140
I have to like him first

73
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:48,500
you?

74
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:49,800
Me too

75
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:57,520
Eventhough she likes me, If I don't like her I won't date her

76
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:01,140
It's a really sad thing to meet without emotion

77
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:04,740
Rock paper scissors

78
00:04:08,385 --> 00:04:09,445
Then

79
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:11,180
We did a lot of things

80
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:17,340
among them tell me one moment you your heart beatted

81
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:21,165
When we went to the clothes shop

82
00:04:21,165 --> 00:04:23,645
When you wore the same clothes as me

83
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:25,215
It's touching

84
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:29,940
Who prepared the gift?

85
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:36,120
I got something for you

86
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:38,560
It was Ho-Jun?

87
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,280
Don't look yet

88
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:48,020
What do you think it is?

89
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:49,500
I have no idea

90
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:52,520
If I give you a hint

91
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:58,240
It's one of the things you wanted to do

92
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,940
What I wanted to do?

93
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:03,520
Is it a couple item?

94
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,500
It is

95
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,580
Ta-da

96
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:15,780
Ho-Jun secretly prepare a gift for Se-hui

97
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,680
He learned to tie though he isn't good at it

98
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,720
He chose it for Se-Hui

99
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:27,620
I finally won!

100
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:29,280
Why did you prepare it?

101
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:32,020
It's touching

102
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,080
There's a unique way to tie it

103
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,400
Hold this

104
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:41,960
He is embarrassed

105
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:46,075
(He self talked)

106
00:05:46,075 --> 00:05:47,075
Like this like this

107
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:49,800
Is that correct?

108
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:51,020
You try it please

109
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:54,000
Se-Hui waits for embarrassed Ho-Jun

110
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:57,700
Isn't he cute?

111
00:05:57,700 --> 00:06:02,200
It's his first time so he doesn't know what to do

112
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:04,840
I don't think it will fit

113
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:12,400
He finally put it on her wrist

114
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:14,700
I'll do it for you

115
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:21,980
Their hands touches a little

116
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:30,640
It's already getting dark but they don't recognize it

117
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,560
Penalty time

118
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:39,220
Did it hurt?

119
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:40,240
It missed

120
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,580
But I think it hit my vain

121
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:43,740
Sorry

122
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:47,600
When I received the gift

123
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:50,480
It was a surprise

124
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:53,260
It was touching

125
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:57,960
It was cute that he had a hard time putting it on to me
