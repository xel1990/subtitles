1
00:00:01,417 --> 00:00:03,711
That’s why I always want to pay

2
00:00:04,003 --> 00:00:05,171
For a pretty picture..

3
00:00:05,546 --> 00:00:06,922
I pay prettily

4
00:00:08,466 --> 00:00:10,760
20 people were recruited to be blind date participants

5
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:13,095
One-sided Blind Date

6
00:00:20,478 --> 00:00:23,773
Other people were very still

7
00:00:23,773 --> 00:00:25,941
but participant 8 had lots of gestures

8
00:00:25,941 --> 00:00:30,029
and looked active, so I chose him

9
00:00:46,337 --> 00:00:48,255
- Hello
- Hello

10
00:00:49,298 --> 00:00:51,383
Uh because I’m Korean-American

11
00:00:51,383 --> 00:00:53,219
I can speak Korean a little,

12
00:00:53,469 --> 00:00:57,306
- would it be okay for me to mix English with Korean as I speak?
- Yes, it's okay

13
00:00:57,765 --> 00:00:59,099
Thank you

14
00:00:59,099 --> 00:01:01,352
Female
Answer the given question

15
00:01:01,352 --> 00:01:03,646
Male
Chooses the option they want

16
00:01:04,438 --> 00:01:06,732
Inclination

17
00:01:09,527 --> 00:01:10,152
Tend to laugh even when things aren’t funny

18
00:01:10,152 --> 00:01:15,407
Tend to laugh even when things aren’t funny
Yes vs No

19
00:01:15,407 --> 00:01:18,577
It is true that I tend to laugh easily

20
00:01:22,289 --> 00:01:24,708
When something’s really not funny, it’s hard to laugh

21
00:01:24,917 --> 00:01:26,669
So at which level do you still laugh at?

22
00:01:26,669 --> 00:01:31,715
I already have a broad sense of humor to begin with,

23
00:01:31,715 --> 00:01:34,260
- Ah because you have a broad sense of humor?
- Yeah so

24
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:35,803
I am basically laughing at most things

25
00:01:35,803 --> 00:01:37,221
Ah so you make sure to laugh at things

26
00:01:37,221 --> 00:01:39,765
- Yes, yes
- so that it doesn’t get awkward for the other person

27
00:01:39,765 --> 00:01:40,724
That’s a relief

28
00:01:40,724 --> 00:01:43,686
I say a lot of jokes that aren’t funny

29
00:01:43,686 --> 00:01:46,480
so when the other person laughs a lot,

30
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:47,898
it makes the atmosphere much more comfortable

31
00:01:51,944 --> 00:01:52,444
When really wanting to rest but partner calls over

32
00:01:52,444 --> 00:01:58,534
When really wanting to rest but partner calls over
You go vs You say you want to rest

33
00:01:58,534 --> 00:02:00,119
I...

34
00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:01,453
I would go

35
00:02:05,124 --> 00:02:07,376
Sometimes you would want at least a day off...

36
00:02:07,459 --> 00:02:09,211
but do you still go?

37
00:02:09,211 --> 00:02:10,754
I would usually go

38
00:02:10,754 --> 00:02:14,258
Even if I want to rest, I think it’s possible to rest together

39
00:02:14,383 --> 00:02:17,344
But if my partner wants to rest

40
00:02:17,344 --> 00:02:19,305
Then I wouldn’t insist on calling them over

41
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:21,390
I’m saying I would go if the decision was on my part

42
00:02:22,349 --> 00:02:23,392
What about you?

43
00:02:23,893 --> 00:02:24,727
- Me?
- Yes

44
00:02:24,727 --> 00:02:26,020
I used to...

45
00:02:26,103 --> 00:02:27,688
I used to go over every time they called me over

46
00:02:27,688 --> 00:02:33,986
but now I tend to rest when I need, as long as it isn’t something urgent or an emergency

47
00:02:33,986 --> 00:02:35,988
If it’s explained...

48
00:02:35,988 --> 00:02:37,573
I wouldn’t not show up without an explanation

49
00:02:37,573 --> 00:02:39,533
- Cause that's bad
- Yeah, if it’s explained, then it would be okay

50
00:02:39,533 --> 00:02:40,451
So I explain

51
00:02:40,492 --> 00:02:42,202
say "I can’t make it"...

52
00:02:42,286 --> 00:02:44,204
Like, it’s important to explain well

53
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:47,041
When a professor makes an inappropriate comment in class,

54
00:02:47,041 --> 00:02:51,086
When a professor makes an inappropriate comment in class,
You stand up against it vs Let it slide

55
00:02:51,086 --> 00:02:52,838
When a professor makes an inappropriate comment in class,
You stand up against it vs Let it slide
- This is a fun question

56
00:02:52,838 --> 00:02:54,632
When a professor makes an inappropriate comment in class,
You stand up against it vs Let it slide
- I really wanted it to be one of the questions

57
00:02:55,716 --> 00:02:57,635
I would stand up against it

58
00:03:00,596 --> 00:03:01,430
Nice!

59
00:03:02,556 --> 00:03:04,975
Do you really stand up? Has it ever happened to you?

60
00:03:04,975 --> 00:03:05,517
Yes

61
00:03:05,935 --> 00:03:09,438
In high school I had a similar experience...

62
00:03:09,438 --> 00:03:10,940
You can’t stand injustice?

63
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:13,233
- Yeah something like that
- Justice... oh you do?

64
00:03:13,233 --> 00:03:14,318
Because I’m like that

65
00:03:14,318 --> 00:03:15,486
I’m also the same

66
00:03:15,486 --> 00:03:19,949
Even recently, I kept getting in so many arguments and fights with my professors

67
00:03:19,949 --> 00:03:22,159
so I received a lot of criticism and a bad reputation...

68
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:22,701
Right, right

69
00:03:22,701 --> 00:03:23,577
People make excuses and,

70
00:03:23,577 --> 00:03:26,497
and say because he’s from abroad, he doesn’t know

71
00:03:26,497 --> 00:03:28,040
- You are Korean, right?
- Yes

72
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:29,249
but the fact that you can relate,

73
00:03:29,249 --> 00:03:31,251
proves that um...

74
00:03:31,251 --> 00:03:32,044
yeah it’s the same

75
00:03:32,044 --> 00:03:33,504
I’m the type to really not let these things slide

76
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:35,214
Really ah... I can never let them slide. 

77
00:03:35,214 --> 00:03:36,507
- I also can’t let them slide, but
- Yes

78
00:03:36,507 --> 00:03:40,928
But I think I can’t criticize people who let things do slide either

79
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:44,390
- Right
- Because I think that they have their reasons

80
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:48,978
But if it were up to me, I think it’s good to speak up

81
00:03:49,019 --> 00:03:51,981
You are surprisingly a pretty strong person, huh?

82
00:03:51,981 --> 00:03:53,649
- Am I?
- You don’t look like it but

83
00:03:53,649 --> 00:03:55,859
- Ah I don't... I don't look like that?
- Your personality seems strong

84
00:03:56,485 --> 00:03:58,278
- But you don’t look like it
- Ah, that’s a relief

85
00:03:58,278 --> 00:04:00,906
It’s cool. You are really cool

86
00:04:03,283 --> 00:04:05,119
Mid-inspection

87
00:04:05,119 --> 00:04:07,413
Already?

88
00:04:12,209 --> 00:04:14,545
He seems like a really delightful person and

89
00:04:14,545 --> 00:04:15,504
umm...

90
00:04:15,504 --> 00:04:18,048
his personality is how I expected it to be

91
00:04:18,215 --> 00:04:20,384
Lively and active...

92
00:04:21,719 --> 00:04:24,013
Seems like a funny person

93
00:04:28,809 --> 00:04:29,852
She really can’t hear, right

94
00:04:29,852 --> 00:04:30,477
Can you hear?

95
00:04:30,477 --> 00:04:31,020
Okay

96
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:31,937
Uh...

97
00:04:32,187 --> 00:04:35,190
She seemed like she would be really nice and soft-hearted

98
00:04:35,441 --> 00:04:39,486
but when she said she stands up for injustice, she seemed really cool

99
00:04:39,486 --> 00:04:43,532
and her self-values are set clearly, so

100
00:04:43,532 --> 00:04:46,785
I see her differently from my first impressions of her

101
00:04:46,785 --> 00:04:48,328
She seems really cool

102
00:04:50,581 --> 00:04:52,332
Values

103
00:04:52,332 --> 00:04:54,418
- Values...
- Values...

104
00:04:57,421 --> 00:04:57,921
Companies need military-styled discipline to a certain degree

105
00:04:57,921 --> 00:05:05,137
Companies need military-styled discipline to a certain degree
Yes vs No

106
00:05:05,137 --> 00:05:07,514
I think there is no need

107
00:05:12,311 --> 00:05:13,312
Nice

108
00:05:13,937 --> 00:05:15,647
In Korea,

109
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:18,942
the culture has practiced it for a long time, right?

110
00:05:18,942 --> 00:05:21,195
So as a Korean, you still don’t think there is no need for it?

111
00:05:21,361 --> 00:05:26,909
It’s not true that all Koreans believe there is need for military-styled discipline in companies, right?

112
00:05:26,909 --> 00:05:29,995
- Right
- So I don’t think there is a need for it either

113
00:05:29,995 --> 00:05:32,998
Instead of calling each other by ranks and titles

114
00:05:32,998 --> 00:05:36,210
I think we need to say each others’ names

115
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:41,006
I think humans need to be treated like humans instead of their ranks

116
00:05:41,215 --> 00:05:44,259
This might be a risky thing to say in today’s society

117
00:05:44,259 --> 00:05:45,511
but for Korea...

118
00:05:45,594 --> 00:05:47,054
The next step?

119
00:05:47,054 --> 00:05:51,391
For Korea to move onto its next step would be by getting rid of the military-styled discipline everywhere

120
00:05:51,391 --> 00:05:55,020
It would be a really quick step to move onto to the next level, I feel like

121
00:05:55,145 --> 00:05:57,606
I’m not saying that other countries are better

122
00:05:57,606 --> 00:06:02,069
but one thing in Korea that’s preventing it is this. Really

123
00:06:02,152 --> 00:06:03,153
Mmm..

124
00:06:03,278 --> 00:06:08,283
I think Korea is a country that had to develop a system of order of rank

125
00:06:08,283 --> 00:06:09,618
- Because we have honorific
- Because of language

126
00:06:09,618 --> 00:06:11,745
Yeah, I think the language differences are huge

127
00:06:11,829 --> 00:06:15,958
For a culture, something that reflects it like a mirror is the language

128
00:06:15,958 --> 00:06:18,168
and we can’t change our language now

129
00:06:18,168 --> 00:06:21,421
But just by easing the order of rank system

130
00:06:21,421 --> 00:06:22,965
A step up...

131
00:06:23,298 --> 00:06:24,258
To advance?

132
00:06:24,967 --> 00:06:26,844
By any chance, did you ever live abroad?

133
00:06:26,844 --> 00:06:28,137
A little...

134
00:06:28,137 --> 00:06:29,346
A little? It seems like it

135
00:06:30,305 --> 00:06:31,723
I normally don’t even like having these conversations

136
00:06:31,723 --> 00:06:34,560
because people have this [conservative] nuance

137
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,771
But because you are saying things I agree with

138
00:06:37,771 --> 00:06:40,065
so... it’s really liberating

139
00:06:40,065 --> 00:06:42,568
It’s very, uh, it’s really.. Yeah

140
00:06:45,904 --> 00:06:46,446
If your partner covers most of the date expenses

141
00:06:46,446 --> 00:06:52,744
If your partner covers most of the date expenses
It’s okay vs it’s not okay

142
00:06:52,744 --> 00:06:54,079
It’s not okay for me

143
00:07:00,043 --> 00:07:03,297
So you like paying for all the dates?

144
00:07:03,297 --> 00:07:04,047
Ah...

145
00:07:04,047 --> 00:07:07,050
It’s not that I like the act of paying for all the expenses

146
00:07:07,217 --> 00:07:08,802
but I always end up wanting to pay for everything every time

147
00:07:08,802 --> 00:07:10,512
I always wanna be the one to pay

148
00:07:10,512 --> 00:07:13,140
It’s partially a expression for my feelings

149
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:14,224
- For her?
- and...

150
00:07:14,224 --> 00:07:15,224
Yeah, for her

151
00:07:15,224 --> 00:07:17,853
and partially manners, in my perspective

152
00:07:18,478 --> 00:07:19,062
And also...

153
00:07:19,062 --> 00:07:20,480
Manners...

154
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:24,276
 when there is a feeling of taking care of someone, I think more feelings can form from that as well

155
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:27,029
Women might not like this expression, but...

156
00:07:27,029 --> 00:07:27,738
It's just...

157
00:07:27,738 --> 00:07:29,531
But the picture looks prettier this way?

158
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:33,118
And I personally like this picture.

159
00:07:33,243 --> 00:07:34,661
It seems more secure

160
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,830
The picture looking prettier...

161
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:38,582
I pay prettily though...

162
00:07:39,374 --> 00:07:41,376
- You pay prettily?
- Yeah I pay prettily and often...

163
00:07:41,627 --> 00:07:44,755
Where do you think that “pretty picture” came from?

164
00:07:46,465 --> 00:07:47,758
This is...

165
00:07:48,926 --> 00:07:51,094
This is hard to pinpoint

166
00:07:51,094 --> 00:07:52,429
I think...

167
00:07:52,429 --> 00:07:55,474
But the influence is from movies like the Godfather?

168
00:07:55,474 --> 00:07:57,100
I watched it a lot

169
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:58,143
In this movie,

170
00:07:58,143 --> 00:07:59,061
The lead male

171
00:07:59,228 --> 00:08:03,273
The lead male always has the image to be protecting over not only women, but his siblings as well

172
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,359
Not saying that this is the correct image

173
00:08:05,359 --> 00:08:07,277
but I think I was heavily influenced by it

174
00:08:07,402 --> 00:08:09,321
Ah, is this what real masculinity is?

175
00:08:09,321 --> 00:08:10,656
- This is how the “picture” formed
- Mmm...

176
00:08:12,824 --> 00:08:14,493
- ...Yes
- You seem to disagree

177
00:08:14,493 --> 00:08:15,577
say what’s on your mind

178
00:08:15,577 --> 00:08:16,745
If you have something to say

179
00:08:16,745 --> 00:08:17,955
"Uhh, umm..."[Imitating her]

180
00:08:18,789 --> 00:08:20,874
In that case, that person

181
00:08:21,041 --> 00:08:23,919
that person just has the financial means

182
00:08:24,378 --> 00:08:25,712
but it doesn’t represent... like manly?

183
00:08:25,712 --> 00:08:28,674
Like it doesn’t represent manliness

184
00:08:28,674 --> 00:08:31,343
But I could see why you would’ve seen that and felt the way you do

185
00:08:31,343 --> 00:08:35,889
Even when little girls watch Disney and Cinderella

186
00:08:35,889 --> 00:08:38,308
- They follow that kind of femininity
- "I wanna be like her"

187
00:08:38,308 --> 00:08:39,893
- That definition of femininity stays with them
- Yes

188
00:08:39,893 --> 00:08:42,604
Because things like that exist, so I understand

189
00:08:43,021 --> 00:08:46,525
But to say you pay because it makes a “pretty picture,”

190
00:08:47,484 --> 00:08:49,278
it would be upsetting to hear

191
00:08:49,319 --> 00:08:51,571
I would want an acknowledgement of my competence

192
00:08:51,571 --> 00:08:53,573
and wouldn’t always want to be protected

193
00:08:53,824 --> 00:08:55,993
Being protected is nice, it’s nice but...

194
00:08:56,451 --> 00:08:58,120
But I think it’s the same for men as well

195
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:01,288
Was I being way too old-school?

196
00:09:01,288 --> 00:09:02,831
Not that old-school, but...

197
00:09:02,916 --> 00:09:04,960
Old fashioned...?

198
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,628
Not to that extent...

199
00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:10,257
In a relationship, fights are necessary

200
00:09:10,257 --> 00:09:14,761
In a relationship, fights are necessary
Yes vs no

201
00:09:14,761 --> 00:09:16,596
I think it’s necessary

202
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:21,977
- It light keeps going off...
- I know right

203
00:09:22,728 --> 00:09:24,479
Why do you think it’s not necessary?

204
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:28,817
There are people who fight and last long

205
00:09:28,817 --> 00:09:34,878
but I personally am the type to not make any reasons to fight and just be considerate

206
00:09:34,878 --> 00:09:36,533
so when fights happen,

207
00:09:36,533 --> 00:09:38,869
my feelings drift away, in spite of myself

208
00:09:38,869 --> 00:09:40,078
- Right
- Little by little

209
00:09:40,078 --> 00:09:41,580
I can’t argue too much

210
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:44,166
The reason I think fights are necessary is

211
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:46,752
because you can see how your partner treats you in that moment

212
00:09:47,002 --> 00:09:50,005
So when your boyfriend makes a mistake or something like that

213
00:09:50,005 --> 00:09:52,090
do you often react to it emotionally?

214
00:09:52,090 --> 00:09:54,134
You have to answer honestly

215
00:09:54,551 --> 00:09:55,344
Just be honest

216
00:09:56,178 --> 00:09:56,970
For me...

217
00:09:56,970 --> 00:09:59,473
My emotions are way too obvious, from my facial expressions

218
00:09:59,473 --> 00:10:02,100
so when I’m angry, I seem angry

219
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:03,643
You just seemed like you were

220
00:10:04,561 --> 00:10:06,313
When you said "I’m angry", your facial expression was like

221
00:10:06,313 --> 00:10:07,981
Your facail expression showed it

222
00:10:07,981 --> 00:10:10,567
Because I look angry when I’m angry

223
00:10:10,567 --> 00:10:12,527
I don’t think I can hide it, so..

224
00:10:12,861 --> 00:10:13,904
You don’t get angry?

225
00:10:14,529 --> 00:10:16,031
Get angry... uh...

226
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:18,867
It’s been a while since I was last angry. Like three years ago?

227
00:10:18,867 --> 00:10:20,619
If I’m at a point of anger,

228
00:10:20,619 --> 00:10:22,579
I have lost all my feelings already

229
00:10:22,579 --> 00:10:24,956
- Mmm... I know it
- And...

230
00:10:24,956 --> 00:10:27,042
And probably tired at that point, yeah

231
00:10:28,085 --> 00:10:31,421
But I still think all of that is a process of love because,

232
00:10:31,671 --> 00:10:32,421
Love is...

233
00:10:32,421 --> 00:10:33,507
Yeah, right

234
00:10:33,507 --> 00:10:35,092
Love is done emotionally rather than rationally

235
00:10:35,092 --> 00:10:37,469
- and it’s not something we follow our brain for
- Right

236
00:10:37,469 --> 00:10:41,473
For me, I know that when I get angry that person’s mood might be ruined but...

237
00:10:41,807 --> 00:10:44,434
Because it is an emotional relationship

238
00:10:44,434 --> 00:10:46,520
and not a business relationship...

239
00:10:49,314 --> 00:10:51,024
Final Decision

240
00:10:51,024 --> 00:10:52,109
- Mmm...
- Mmm...

241
00:10:58,657 --> 00:11:05,997
Interest in dating
Send an O X accordingly

242
00:11:05,997 --> 00:11:07,290
Did you send it?

243
00:11:11,545 --> 00:11:12,796
How was it today?

244
00:11:13,004 --> 00:11:14,506
Uh... It's like...

245
00:11:15,006 --> 00:11:17,342
Because you are Korean

246
00:11:17,342 --> 00:11:19,136
I was wondering if I needed to be more reserved

247
00:11:19,136 --> 00:11:22,681
and I also needed some time to use English and relax, but because you were so considerate and went along with everything

248
00:11:22,681 --> 00:11:24,433
I was thankful and it was nice

249
00:11:24,808 --> 00:11:25,934
and really fun time

250
00:11:26,017 --> 00:11:28,186
A really good experience for me

251
00:11:28,186 --> 00:11:30,230
You spoke so humorously,

252
00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:32,107
so it was helpful for me as well

253
00:11:32,107 --> 00:11:33,692
I’m usually funnier than this

254
00:11:33,692 --> 00:11:36,027
but because I was nervous so I

255
00:11:36,236 --> 00:11:38,363
- Me too
- Refrained from a lot of things

256
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:39,656
You know what I’m saying

257
00:11:42,284 --> 00:11:48,331
The light will turn off on the side that sent an X
