1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,940
I predict that you are going to have crush on me

2
00:00:01,940 --> 00:00:03,360
by the end of this blind date.

3
00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:05,660
okay

4
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:12,260
hello

5
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:17,940
I'm Min Joon Woo and I'm 20 years old.

6
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:20,340
I'm Lee Jee and I'm 20 years old.

7
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:21,460
Lee Jee?

8
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:21,960
Yes

9
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:23,020
You have a pretty name

10
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:23,900
Thanks.

11
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:26,880
Can we speak casually?

12
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:27,800
Yeah

13
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:33,220
Wanna do a shot?

14
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:33,720
Yeah

15
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:38,800
Can I do half a shot?

16
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,300
No, you can’t

17
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:45,760
I'll start.

18
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:48,360
Why are you so tense and nervous?

19
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:51,860
Because you are prettier than I expected

20
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:52,520
Thanks

21
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:53,720
Should I pour you a shot?

22
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:55,880
You know how to say the right words.

23
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:02,980
JOONWOO’S GREATEST BREAK AWAY of 20-YEAR OLD LIFE IS ______.

24
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:05,640
Going to the club?

25
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:09,600
You got it perfectly right.

26
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:12,020
You look like...

27
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:13,880
you live at the clubs

28
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:16,740
Wait, wait.

29
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:18,320
Oh my god

30
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:19,360
it just got hot.

31
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:21,480
Not in a stereotypical way,

32
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:23,160
I say it like a compliment

33
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:26,060
No, that's not a compliment

34
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:31,680
I went clubbing for the first time this past July.

35
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:32,660
Really?

36
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:34,580
You don’t know how to party

37
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:38,600
You should go there on the New Year’s Day with your ID on your forehead

38
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:41,180
I heard it was packed that day.

39
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:42,580
You must like clubbing.

40
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:43,880
Club? Of course.

41
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:46,000
Hongdae is my turf

42
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:47,880
Vexx, Maxx?

43
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:48,840
Yeah, I swept them all.

44
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:51,400
Do you put your hair over your ear as you walk into the club?

45
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:53,760
You gotta toss your hair back like this.

46
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:56,240
Shall we drink?

47
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,040
Sure.

48
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,460
Wait wait wait.

49
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:11,040
JOON WOO DOES OR DOESN’T ACTIVELY EXPRESS HIS FEELINGS TO THE GIRL HE LIKES.

50
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:12,440
I think you would.

51
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:14,340
I would? Final answer?

52
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:16,400
Yeah

53
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,860
Then how about now?

54
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:19,720
RIght now...

55
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:22,220
I think you're interested in me

56
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:23,300
Judging from what?

57
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:24,760
The sparkle in your eyes

58
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:27,260
My eyes? My eyes?

59
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:30,700
When I like someone,

60
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:31,880
I can’t hide it.

61
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:34,580
So I was right.

62
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:35,580
How about you?

63
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:38,220
I think you won't tell if you like someone.

64
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:39,100
No you're wrong.

65
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:41,040
Then, how do you express it?

66
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,400
I make a crazy effort to see that person.

67
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,540
In anyway?

68
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:45,100
Yes

69
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:47,040
if that person is in a different class,

70
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,300
I will go audit that class

71
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:51,280
and try to sit next to that person by accident.

72
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:54,640
Then out of 10, do 9 fall for you?

73
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:55,800
Easy

74
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:56,640
Whoa.

75
00:02:57,740 --> 00:03:00,220
Your self-esteem is overflowing

76
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:03,400
I'll pick.

77
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:07,120
Oh, I was curious about this one.

78
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:12,380
LEE JEE HAS BEEN IN RELATIONSHIP ____ TIMES.

79
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:14,720
Won’t you get offended by the answer?

80
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:15,280
No.

81
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:17,660
ten…

82
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:18,240
times…

83
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:21,740
You really think that way?

84
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:23,540
wow

85
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:27,120
Take a shot first because you are wrong.

86
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:30,520
You dismissed me

87
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:31,800
I dismissed you?

88
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:34,120
because I guessed too high or too low?

89
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,580
Because you guessed too low.

90
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:37,300
It's 20 times.

91
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:39,860
You count them all?

92
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:42,940
I cannot. It's confusing but around there

93
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,740
My longest relationship was 200 days

94
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:47,480
but it's never been over 1 year.

95
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:50,860
Same. I've never dated longer than a year.

96
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:53,340
I try to compensate for that other person a lot.

97
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:55,900
So eventually I get tired of that person

98
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:57,660
and she gets tired of me too.

99
00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:01,180
I usually take the initiative and hold onto the guy.

100
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:04,100
So you don’t like to be adored?

101
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:06,240
Right. So I like to take care of the person.

102
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:08,120
For example, if he says "I wanna eat that"

103
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,860
and I'll say "really?, let’s grab them later"

104
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:11,580
and then the next day I'll buy that for him

105
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:12,900
and be like “Here.”

106
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,740
Wow. So you are like cold outside but warm inside.

107
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:20,400
That’s quite attractive.

108
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:21,920
I predict that

109
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:24,040
you are going to have crush on me by the end of this blind date.

110
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:27,100
Okay~

111
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:28,560
Can you pour the rest

112
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,380
No, you drink mine too

113
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,740
I can totally tell about this one

114
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:40,100
JOON WOO CAN OR CANNOT LET HIS GIRLFRIEND GET DRINKS WITH OTHER GUY FRIENDS

115
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:40,860
You cannot.....

116
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:44,280
is what you think I was gonna say right?

117
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:46,060
Ah, that's a foul.

118
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:47,780
You can't do that.

119
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:49,980
You're not lenient huh?

120
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:56,720
Before, I didn't allow it,

121
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,060
but after becoming 20 years old now

122
00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:00,120
I realized that person has to live her life too

123
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:03,420
and hang out with her friends and I try to respect that.

124
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:07,060
I think if that friend is a woman, it's an automatic no.

125
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:08,200
May be  just a meal.

126
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,140
Like he's mine

127
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:09,720
Of course.

128
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:10,620
No one else can meet him?

129
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:11,820
Yesh. Like I said before,

130
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:13,120
I take the initiative in the relationship.

131
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:15,600
Our opinions are different.

132
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:23,900
JOON WOO CAN PICK UP UPTO ________ YEARS OLD .

133
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:27,220
You look very confident

134
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:28,480
so I say 30?

135
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:30,140
No, you're wrong.

136
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:31,280
29...?

137
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,140
29!

138
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:35,360
Can you guess again?

139
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:39,040
You're not lenient at all!

140
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,140
I poured less than before.

141
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:42,620
Comparing how much you poured to me, I'm being fair.

142
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,140
Want me to drink with you?

143
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:44,820
Yes.

144
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:50,000
I thought my answer was 29

145
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:50,780
hmm..

146
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:53,060
Mine is 26, 27?

147
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:56,420
So anyone under 30, you can lure them?

148
00:05:56,740 --> 00:05:57,760
of course

149
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:00,760
To have young ambitions!

150
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:05,620
when do you wanna get married?

151
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:08,400
I honestly think age doesn’t matter.

152
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:14,120
Just, if I like that person and I trust that person.

153
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:17,540
You never know a person's life and future right?

154
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:19,620
So with that thought,

155
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:23,800
I want to be very caring and discreet to that person.

156
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:24,940
Me too.

157
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:25,720
You too?

158
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:28,960
But even though you've dated short relationships after short relationships?

159
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:31,260
Sorry, that was rude.

160
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:34,480
Watch out. I told you to be lenient, I am warning you.

161
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:41,540
JOON WOO EVER HAD OR DIDN’T HAVE A MOMENT WHEN HE WANTED TO AGE FASTER.

162
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:42,200
I think you have.

163
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,020
I have?

164
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:43,980
Are you sure?

165
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:45,400
I will give you one more chance.

166
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,660
you have!

167
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:51,640
I did have moment when I wanted to age faster.

168
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:53,900
So you can go clubbing

169
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:56,540
and be better at flirting right?

170
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:58,440
Stop bringing up clubbing.

171
00:06:58,440 --> 00:06:59,640
I don’t like clubbing that much

172
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:00,340
Kidding, kidding.

173
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:02,060
Anyway, not for that reason.

174
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:05,300
Because as a Korean male

175
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:08,740
I have to mandatorily serve military service

176
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:12,140
so… I'm worried of if I met someone I really like.

177
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:13,440
Oh, my heart aches

178
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,860
So I am jealous of the ones who are already done with the service.

179
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:19,620
And if I have girlfriend at that time I wish she wouldn’t wait.

180
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:20,980
Is it burdensome?

181
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,160
Not so much so.

182
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:27,580
I honestly think age 20, 21 is the prime time for women

183
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:33,140
And as much as I'll like to do my best for her. That's not something I can guarantee.

184
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:38,280
But if she can give me one more chance after my service,

185
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:40,760
I think that'll be enough

186
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:43,620
Is it okay if she meets other guys during your service?

187
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:46,820
I don’t think I have right to suppress her choices.

188
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:48,480
She has her own life and has to live her own life

189
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,400
Wow, you're awesome

190
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:50,260
What do you mean? How?

191
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:51,820
Just you are freaking awesome

192
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:55,500
I don’t think you'll wait anyways

193
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:57,900
I thought like that too first.

194
00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:00,000
But if I really love him, I think I can

195
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:01,500
If he's the one?

196
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:04,260
If someone I really like waited for me,

197
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:06,860
I will definitely make her happy.

198
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:11,600
LEE JEE PREFERS TO TALK TO HER BOYFRIEND VIA MESSENGER OR ON THE PHONE.

199
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,340
Phone.

200
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:13,920
You are right.

201
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:17,420
I really like talking on the phone.

202
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:19,080
Like I can put it on a speaker phone

203
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:20,580
and do something else,

204
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:23,280
or I can be on the phone while getting ready.

205
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:26,160
I did want to try talking on the phone all night until you both fall asleep

206
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,660
and in the next morning, you're both still on the phone.

207
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:29,780
I have unlimited minutes

208
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,500
Can I call you later?

209
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:34,200
Of course, I am unlimited.

210
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:38,200
I like casual relationship.

211
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,640
Casual? How?

212
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:42,420
I show wacky pictures of myself while video calling

213
00:08:42,420 --> 00:08:43,940
and meet up with no make-up and stuff.

214
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:45,320
I’ve never experienced that.

215
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:45,940
(I look pretty without make up)

216
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:47,320
(I look pretty without make up)

217
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,920
(Okay, I'll call you later. )

218
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:53,580
What is that meaningful smile?

219
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:59,260
JOON WOO FEELS THE SAME OR DIFFERENTLY ABOUT LEE JEE NOW COMPARED TO THE FIRST MOMENT

220
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:00,240
Same!

221
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:01,220
Different!

222
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:02,400
Why?

223
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:05,740
Drink first and then I'll tell you.

224
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:08,620
Be lenient.

225
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:10,320
Okay. Lenient.

226
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:15,520
Initially, you looked quiet and calm,

227
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:20,040
but you're actually very bright and outgoing and kind of wacky.

228
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:21,020
You are right.

229
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,600
Is there anything you're curious about?

230
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,140
I am going to ask you straight forward.

231
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:29,700
Are you going to keep in touch with me?

232
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:31,340
Yeah, I am

233
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:32,180
Really?

234
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:34,520
Should I pour you a shot?

235
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:36,040
Yeah, I'll pour you one too.

236
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:37,760
Last shot

237
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:42,900
It was fun today

238
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:43,800
Me too,

239
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,300
I think you are a nice person.

240
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:46,000
Really?

241
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,600
That's all you have to say?

242
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:49,120
Yes… I mean no.

243
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:54,080
You are very bright, outgoing, and look like you enjoy clubbing

244
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,240
Let’s disregard the last part

245
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,880
You seem like you love clubbing.

246
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:02,240
This is my last question.

247
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:04,820
When are you doing your military service?

248
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:10,920
If we start a relationship, I'll go much later.

249
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,100
really?

250
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:13,340
About when?

251
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:21,100
when I get a guarantee that you will wait for me?
