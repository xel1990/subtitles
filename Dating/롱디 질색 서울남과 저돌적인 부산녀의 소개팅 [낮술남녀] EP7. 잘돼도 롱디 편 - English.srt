1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,720
Where do u think I live?

2
00:00:01,900 --> 00:00:03,380
Mmm... *thinking*

3
00:00:03,380 --> 00:00:05,500
It takes about an hour by airplane.

4
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:07,960
By any chance, do you live in _______?

5
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:08,700
Yeah.

6
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:09,660
Wow.

7
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:11,320
What do you think about that?

8
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:14,380
I don't think I can make a comment about that.

9
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:15,680
You can’t?

10
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:24,820
Hello.

11
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:28,300
Well, this is awkward.

12
00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:31,720
What is your name?

13
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:32,980
My name is Jung Haejin.

14
00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:34,200
Jung Haejin?

15
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:37,160
I am 28 years old

16
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:38,640
and my name is Choi Cheolwon.

17
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:39,400
Cheolwon?

18
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:40,300
Yes, Cheolwon.

19
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:42,460
I think...

20
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:45,460
I think we need to take a shot to loosen up a bit.

21
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:01,560
Do you happen to have a symptom?

22
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:02,940
No, I just have a bit of a hand tremor.

23
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:13,700
I’ll go first.

24
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:20,060
JUDGING FROM THE FIRST IMPRESSION CHEOLWON’S JOB IS EITHER A HAIR DESIGNER OR AN ADVERTISEMENT PRODUCER

25
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:22,400
I think you're an advertisement producer.

26
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:23,600
Yes. Correct.

27
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:24,200
Oh…

28
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:26,700
Your reaction is so...

29
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:29,580
seems like you weren’t even curious.

30
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:31,260
No, no. You just kind of looked like it.

31
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:32,300
Really?

32
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:34,820
What is your age?

33
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:35,880
I am 23 years old.

34
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:36,780
Oh, 23 years old?

35
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:37,580
Yes.

36
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:39,500
And are you a student right now?

37
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:40,900
No, I am not a student.

38
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:42,000
I'm an airline staff.

39
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,220
Airline staff?

40
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:45,700
what kind of work do you do?

41
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,840
So I don't work on flights, but everything else in the airport.

42
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:51,400
Oh, you work at the airport?

43
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:53,100
Then Gimpo Airport?

44
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:55,400
Wrong!

45
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,760
Do I have to take a shot now?

46
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,360
Let's drink together

47
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,200
okay.

48
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:04,700
You are shaking again.

49
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:12,760
BETWEEN BODY VS FACE, WHEN CHEOLWON FIRST LOOKS AT A WOMEN, HE LOOKS AT ________.

50
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:15,700
Body.

51
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:18,340
Wrong. The answer is face

52
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:20,940
Oh, you're shaking less.

53
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:22,860
Because the bottle is leaning on the shot glass.

54
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:28,580
I think when I look at someone's face,

55
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:30,000
I look at their eyes a lot.

56
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:30,560
Oh...

57
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,300
I like people with pretty eyes.

58
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:33,660
Me too.

59
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:36,820
I think the sparkles in someone's eyes are important.

60
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:38,400
How about mine?

61
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:41,020
Your eyes?

62
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:42,580
They look very kind.

63
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:44,900
Kind and good-hearted.

64
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,780
Thank you.

65
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:49,220
Let’s have another drink.

66
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:51,400
I need to get more comfortable.

67
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,600
Oh, what’s your limit?

68
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:53,800
I'm okay to drink.

69
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,900
I think your alcohol tolerance is higher than mine.

70
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:58,300
I think so too.

71
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:04,260
HAEJIN CAN OR CANNOT SHOW HER BARE FACE TO HER BOYFRIEND?

72
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:05,600
Cannot.

73
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:06,460
Wrong.

74
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:07,900
Oh, you can show your bare face?

75
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,080
Before I couldn't.

76
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,600
This story needs more explanation...

77
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:13,900
but I kept thinking ‘what if he gets disappointed in me.’

78
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:16,400
So I thought I needed to show my pretty face all the time

79
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,340
and we couldn't go out on dates for a long time.

80
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:21,100
But now when I think about it,

81
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:25,740
I am more comfortable now

82
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:27,720
and I want to spend more time with them.

83
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:31,500
And you want to meet a boyfriend who adores your bare face?

84
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:32,700
Yes. Exactly.

85
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,460
You don't like bare faces?

86
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:35,460
No, no.

87
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:38,600
I like that kind of relationship too.

88
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,520
Who cares if I see my girlfriend’s bare face?

89
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:44,160
In my experience, even though I like that person, if we're not totally comfortable with each other,

90
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:45,560
we become more distant in the end.

91
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:48,060
I enjoy having a date at home and watching movies.

92
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:49,100
Dating at home?

93
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:50,200
Do you live alone?

94
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,540
Yes, I am currently living alone.

95
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:53,660
So I like dates at home,

96
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,900
and walk around the neighborhood in our flip flops,

97
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:58,620
go to the movies...

98
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:00,300
Just those kind of casual dates.

99
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:01,840
I see.

100
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:05,200
Do you not use casual speech?

101
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,160
Me?

102
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:08,580
Casual speech is more comfortable than formal speech.

103
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:11,260
Do you like speaking casually?

104
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:12,100
Yes.

105
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:13,860
Should we talk casually?

106
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:14,800
Yeah.

107
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:21,920
HAEJIN'S MOST CONFIDENT BODY PART IS _______.

108
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:25,320
Wait I gotta think about it…

109
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:26,320
Eyes?

110
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:27,360
My eyes?

111
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,000
Yes.

112
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:29,420
Wrong.

113
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:30,900
Take a shot.

114
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:34,520
Why did you say eyes?

115
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,480
Oh, because your eyes are pretty.

116
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:37,500
Oh, thanks.

117
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:39,020
Don't you hear that a lot?

118
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:40,160
That your eyes are pretty?

119
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,580
My mom has a nice nose,

120
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:44,580
so a lot of people say I got her nose

121
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:46,560
and say this part is high and pretty.

122
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:49,260
Oh so your nose prettiest.

123
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:50,080
Right here.

124
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:52,160
I shook it to show that its natural.

125
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,940
Yeah, your nose is pretty.

126
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:54,940
Thank you.

127
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:58,120
You look like this celebrity.

128
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:58,960
Who? Who?

129
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:00,540
Do you know rapper ‘One’?

130
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:01,900
Oh, oh I see.

131
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:03,320
You look like One.

132
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:04,660
I've heard that a lot.

133
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,820
But slightly more masculine version of 'One'.

134
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:10,780
Oh, slightly more?

135
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:12,700
Want to drink?

136
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:17,480
Wow, you're not shaking anymore.

137
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:19,080
Oh, I am way more comfortable now.

138
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,860
Now that I've had a few,

139
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:22,820
I'm okay.

140
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:24,660
What is your alcohol tolerance?

141
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:25,800
My tolerance?

142
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:29,300
About 2.5 bottles of soju?

143
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:30,820
I like to drink.

144
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:31,840
Oh you do?

145
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,960
Yes, I like to drink and talk.

146
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:36,520
I think you need to drink to get to know a person.

147
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:37,500
Oh. Right...

148
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:39,500
You can have sincere conversation.

149
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:42,500
You get comfortable and show more of yourself.

150
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:45,060
So I always drink once or twice when I meet someone.

151
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:46,300
Once or twice?

152
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:47,260
Like when dating?

153
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:48,900
Yes, with someone I'm interested in.

154
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:50,700
Do you want to take a shot?

155
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:52,800
I think we need to drink more.

156
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:59,320
WHEN CHEOLWON MISSES HIS GIRLFRIEND, HE GOES TO SEE HER NO MATTER WHAT OR HE RESTRAINS.

157
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:01,100
You go no matter what.

158
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:02,600
Correct.

159
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,800
You have to see her?

160
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:10,020
What I mean is that when you're in a relationship of course you miss each other

161
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:14,660
But when I'm having a difficult time and miss her,

162
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:16,780
I'd be grateful to have her meet me.

163
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:20,080
What would you do if you have a girlfriend and she's abroad?

164
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,800
She's abroad after we're dating?

165
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:22,800
From the start.

166
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,800
From the time you met her, she's abroad.

167
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,400
I don't think I can be in a relationship with her.

168
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,340
You can't?

169
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:28,980
I don't like long distance relationships.

170
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:29,600
You don't?

171
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,400
I've given myself a limit of 40 minutes distance away.

172
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:32,000
40 minutes?

173
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:34,500
Then that means you have to be live within the same province, no matter what.

174
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:35,800
Yes

175
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:38,080
because when I miss her, I can go see her.

176
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:40,100
Right.

177
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:43,560
You're just agreeing so casually.

178
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:44,600
*laughs*

179
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,420
Where do you think I live?

180
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:50,600
Seoul is very big, you know?

181
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:54,520
I am pretty good at guessing these stuff.

182
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:55,820
I don’t think you live in Seoul.

183
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:56,900
Incheon!

184
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,600
Incheon?

185
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,760
You work at an airport,

186
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:02,720
so I'm thinking like Incheon or Gimpo.

187
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:04,500
But there are so many airports.

188
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,200
guess where.

189
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:10,300
Incheon airport, Gimpo airport..

190
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:13,000
Are you from Busan by any chance?

191
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:14,500
Yeah.

192
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:16,980
(Seoul to Busan is about 5 hours car ride)

193
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:19,980
Wow...

194
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:23,280
I feel like I’ve just been pranked.

195
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,600
Wow for reals?

196
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,580
What do you think?

197
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:31,900
I couldn’t even sleep to come up and do this.

198
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:33,660
I don't think I can even comment about this.

199
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:34,660
You can’t?

200
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:37,460
Oh Busan. I see.

201
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:39,900
Your intensions dropped when you heard Busan huh?

202
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:43,180
No, it's not that.

203
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:48,440
Lots of people from the suburbs actually live in Seoul.

204
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:50,240
I would’ve thought same too if I were you.

205
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,440
It didn't even see that coming.

206
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:55,380
For reals, I couldn’t even imagined that you were from Busan.

207
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:56,160
Oh really?

208
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,800
Yeah, I didn’t know.

209
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:04,520
WHAT IS HAEJIN’S IDEAL WORK TO RELATIONSHIP RATIO?

210
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:06,400
There's no hint?

211
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,340
No, there isn’t. Guess the answer, right now.

212
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,120
10 to 0?

213
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:11,940
Here...

214
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:15,400
What is 10?

215
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:17,020
Relationship.

216
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:18,200
I am 5 to 5.

217
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:19,080
5 to 5?

218
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:20,700
It's case by case depending on the job and the person.

219
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:24,600
There's a time when a job is more important and when a person is more important.

220
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:29,460
So I cannot divide something completely.

221
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:33,860
For instance, you got promoted for a job in a different location,

222
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:36,340
but you have to leave your boyfriend who is in Seoul,

223
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:37,800
would you go?

224
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:38,620
Oh.

225
00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:42,860
I would stay in Seoul.

226
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:47,740
because I must be somewhat qualified to be promoted,

227
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:50,200
so I can probably find a great opportunity in Seoul too.

228
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,300
Even when you are in Seoul?

229
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:53,220
Yes, because I know that once I break up with my boyfriend,

230
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:55,700
I won't be able to meet him again.

231
00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:58,780
Fact is person first?

232
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:02,720
If you said 6 to 4 ratio, you wouldn't had to drink.

233
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:09,720
HAEJIN CAN OR CANNOT MARRY BEFORE AGE 25.

234
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:10,960
Cannot.

235
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:12,700
Drink. Hurry up and drink.

236
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:13,920
I got it all wrong.

237
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:16,320
I am getting drunk now.

238
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,600
If I like someone, I can.

239
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:22,300
I always tell my mom that I want to get married early.

240
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:23,300
What's the reason?

241
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:25,200
I want stability and security with my family.

242
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:28,640
There are times when I am mentally insecure,

243
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:31,200
but getting married and having a family of my own,

244
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:34,020
I can depend on my husband.

245
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,860
I couldn’t agree with you more.

246
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:38,720
Me too.

247
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:41,940
Right now I've been living alone for about 4 years.

248
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:44,620
And I work overtime a lot

249
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:48,320
and when I come home, no one is waiting for me at home.

250
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,600
I'm thinking what am I working for?

251
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:54,040
Kind of like empty feeling

252
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:56,680
So can you give your earnings to you wife?

253
00:09:57,580 --> 00:10:00,320
Well, if we live together, it's all the same.

254
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,620
You were stuttering just now

255
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:03,040
Oh you caught me.

256
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,780
Your point is off when it comes to money.

257
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:06,520
No, we live together so…

258
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:09,540
I think we drank the most.

259
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:11,140
I know right?

260
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:12,360
Can you pour me a shot?

261
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,480
I'm worried I'm too sober.

262
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:19,160
It’s the last one.

263
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:21,280
Last question.

264
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:32,780
COMPARED TO THE FIRST MOMENT HAEJIN HAS SAME OR DIFFERENT FEELINGS TOWARD CHEOLWON.

265
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,440
I think different.

266
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,400
Do I have to drink?

267
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,560
I am nervous now.

268
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:43,020
For your sake, I'll say different.

269
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:45,780
At first, I was so nervous,

270
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:47,260
I didn't have any thoughts.

271
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:50,920
I didn't even register your face, your eyes, nothing.

272
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:52,140
After some conversation,

273
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:54,380
I realized we just need to talk more.

274
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:58,740
We are from different areas too and after we talk about a lot of different things,

275
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:02,620
maybe our opinions will overlap.

276
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:05,960
Can I ask you too?

277
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:07,400
Yeah sure.

278
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:09,200
How do you feel about me?

279
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,480
Whoa, what is this? Out of nowhere.

280
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:15,580
Because you could have met someone else, but you met me.

281
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,020
The thing I'm worried about is...

282
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:19,740
I didn't consider about long distance relationship at all.

283
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:21,340
Right, I would’ve thought the same.

284
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:27,520
But we were able to have a nice conversation like talking and asking questions.

285
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:31,960
So gradually...

286
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:32,960
Oh really?

287
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:37,720
Is there anything you want to ask me as a last question?

288
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:39,060
Something I'm curious about?

289
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:42,460
Have you ever had a long distance relationship?

290
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:43,820
No.

291
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:45,520
They were all in Busan?

292
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:46,300
Yes.

293
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:51,440
So what do you think about meeting someone from far away?

294
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:53,040
I don't really care.

295
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:56,300
If I miss my boyfriend, I think I will go to see him.

296
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:59,220
Even if I can only see him for 30 minutes I will go.

297
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:04,780
I can try hard to not make him sad about not being able to meet me.

298
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:07,640
When is your train back to Busan?

299
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,920
Oh~ It's at 9pm.

300
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:12,520
Are you down?

301
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:13,820
Yes, I am down..
