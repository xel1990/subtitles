PARK JIN-HO IS ABLE TO PICK UP A GIRL THAT HE JUST MET

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:02,720
You can.

3
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:04,300
Why why why?

4
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:05,160
I know now,

5
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:06,360
What?

6
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:07,200
You are a player

7
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:07,980
I am 100% sure.

8
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:16,000
How do you do

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,420
Hello

10
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:21,560
My name is Park Jin-ho

11
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:24,120
I’m Jeong Hyun-jin

12
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:25,280
You have a pretty name

13
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:27,380
Would you like some first

14
00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:28,240
No let me

15
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:30,740
I don’t usually drink during the day

16
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,180
Nice to meet you

17
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:38,420
What do you do, Hyun-jin?

18
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:39,360
I’m freshmen in college

19
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:40,260
Oh right, you’re 21

20
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:40,760
Yes

21
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:41,420
College student

22
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:41,920
Yeah

23
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:42,900
I’m 25

24
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,820
I’ve done my military service

25
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,320
I’m a manager of a bar

26
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:53,360
And I run the place too.

27
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:54,500
Then I’ll pick one

28
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:59,440
PARK JIN-HO’s ideal type woman is ________.

29
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:02,460
Judging from your bright and outgoing personality

30
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:07,600
I think you would prefer humorous and funny type of girls.

31
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:08,840
You are on the right path.

32
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:09,860
Was I?

33
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:11,820
Among Cute, Sexy, Sweet categories

34
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:14,200
I prefer sweet and innocent type.

35
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:16,340
Ahh sweet and innocent.

36
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:18,620
Short haired, long haired doesn’t matter

37
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:20,140
If it fits the person.

38
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:21,760
You have quite lovely hair yourself.

39
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:23,220
I am flattered.

40
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:27,160
How about you Hyun-jin, what is your ideal type?

41
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:28,680
I prefer monolids.

42
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:29,500
Monolids?

43
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:30,320
Mine totally.

44
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,660
They are perfect monolids.

45
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:37,420
And when a guys has a cute smile, that turns me on.

46
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Let me draw a card out

47
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,480
By the way

48
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:45,140
sorry to bother you,

49
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,980
but I think it’s because I’m using honorific that I can’t talk freely

50
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:49,260
Then you can talk down to me

51
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:50,560
Great, why don’t you do so too

52
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:53,160
No, I’m very shy

53
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:55,600
Maybe not talking down,

54
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,580
but I could call you “oppa”

55
00:01:57,580 --> 00:01:58,500
As you wish then

56
00:01:58,500 --> 00:01:59,600
Here we go!

57
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:07,520
PARK JIN-HO PREFERS TO SET HIS MESSNENGER PROFILE PIC AS A COUPLE PIC OR NOT.

58
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:09,020
You prefer.

59
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:10,280
I prefer?

60
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,920
Here take a shot.

61
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,180
Why not?

62
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:15,980
There is a profile pic and a cover.

63
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:17,000
I am ok with the cover.

64
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,760
I can allow cover.

65
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:20,720
But I cannot allow profile picture.

66
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,440
Do you like to show that you are taken or not

67
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:25,600
Well..

68
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:28,200
I am not too desperate to show that I am taken.

69
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,960
I love to let everyone know that I have a boyfriend.

70
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,960
Everywhere? Like a newspaper?

71
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:36,740
Yes.

72
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:38,040
Alright.

73
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:39,280
It’s my turn, right?

74
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,000
Yes

75
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:44,640
JEONG HYUN-JIN’S LONGEST RELATIONSHIP LASTED FOR ___ YEARS

76
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:47,980
About 4 to 5 years?

77
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:50,000
4-5 years? For real?

78
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,720
Was it months or years? Just give me that

79
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,060
Months

80
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:55,840
Oh it’s even months, okay

81
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:56,960
3 months?

82
00:02:59,000 --> 00:02:59,880
One month

83
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:01,600
One month? That’s the longest?

84
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:02,380
Yes

85
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:03,440
I’m just forever alone

86
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,120
So almost forever alone?

87
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:05,740
Right

88
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:08,100
Time to drink

89
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:08,780
Okay okay

90
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:09,720
I’ll have it too

91
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:11,020
one month....

92
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:13,900
How should I put it

93
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:15,820
How come only one month?

94
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:17,660
It was never with someone I liked

95
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:20,080
Oh I see it was someone who liked you

96
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,800
Seriously I want to try a long term relationship

97
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:27,920
I also don’t have that much experience with someone that I liked.

98
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,440
So what’s the longest for you?

99
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:30,580
Two years.

100
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:31,780
Hmmm.

101
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:33,060
I am jealous.

102
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:34,320
You are jealous?

103
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:37,120
I have only dated once when I was 20.

104
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,220
And since then

105
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:39,720
Nothing?

106
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:40,360
Nothing at all.

107
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,040
Nothing at all?

108
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:43,780
You could’ve asked the person you liked out

109
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:44,300
I got rejected.

110
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:45,600
Oh really? You got rejected alot?

111
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:46,840
I am wounded

112
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:49,380
I see… So that’s why it only lasted a month…

113
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:50,280
I understand…

114
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,640
That’s fine,

115
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:53,760
it happens you’re still just 21

116
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,300
If it was just once when you were 20

117
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:57,080
that’s just last year

118
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:57,860
That’s totally possible

119
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,920
This is a good question

120
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,920
It looks promising out of all questions today

121
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:11,620
BETWEEN AN EXPERT IN LOVE OR A NEWBIE JUNG HYUN-JIN PREFERS WHICH ONE?

122
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,600
Not my final answer but, newbie?

123
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:16,320
Don’t say yes or no

124
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,920
just look me in the eyes, newbie?

125
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:20,300
Expert?

126
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,200
A Newbie

127
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,160
You’re right

128
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,640
Thought so

129
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:27,500
How about you?

130
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:30,360
Newbie versus an expert..

131
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:31,740
Each has their pros and cons

132
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:32,500
So which one?

133
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:33,720
So answer first?

134
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:34,220
Sure

135
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:35,000
Wait a second

136
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,500
I like someone who knows things

137
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:37,600
A player to some degree

138
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:43,100
To meet a less experienced person I feel like I have to be the teacher

139
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:44,160
Ahh

140
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:46,900
But even if she’s player

141
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:49,060
I wouldn’t want her to be on another level

142
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:49,880
I guess you’re a player then?

143
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:51,180
No, I’m such a newbie

144
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:53,040
What I mean is that,

145
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:56,040
it’s better to know things to a certain level than being totally naive

146
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,580
I finally know now.

147
00:04:57,580 --> 00:04:58,720
You’re a player

148
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,920
I am 100% sure.

149
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,040
I can tell

150
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,000
Positive

151
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:02,740
Not at all

152
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:04,680
I don’t know anything See my hands shaking?

153
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,320
My turn.

154
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:11,040
WHEN IS THE AGE THAT PARK JIN-HO HAD HIS FIRST KISS?

155
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:11,940
When you were fifteen?

156
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:12,840
You’re wrong

157
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,640
I’ll drink then

158
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:19,220
10th Grade

159
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:21,000
How about you? Around when?

160
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,520
In my case,

161
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:23,180
When you were 20?

162
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:23,960
Yes, correct

163
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:25,960
I suddenly feel shallow.

164
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:28,600
Oh wait. It’s not that year

165
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:30,660
Ok ok ok

166
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,840
It was one year prior

167
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:34,840
1 year? Then you were 19?

168
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:36,420
Maybe you should think about it hard once more

169
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:37,380
No that’s right

170
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:38,940
Senior year of high school can be tough

171
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,780
So you released stress by kissing, on your senior year?

172
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:41,700
ok

173
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:44,160
You are making it sound all weird now

174
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,880
Why? It’s possible.

175
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:48,100
I release my stress by eating.

176
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:49,740
So you ate the lips?

177
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:53,800
And you liked it

178
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,080
Shall we toast?

179
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:56,420
Have some, you

180
00:05:56,420 --> 00:05:57,480
I still have it

181
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,660
No my glass

182
00:05:58,660 --> 00:05:59,200
No my glass

183
00:05:59,200 --> 00:05:59,700
Oh you want it

184
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:02,240
Cheers

185
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,120
Sure

186
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:11,800
PARK JIN-HO CAN GO AS FAR AS ____ IN TERMS OF PHYSICAL TOUCH ON THE FIRST DATE

187
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:14,040
I see you as a free-minded person

188
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:17,060
So, a hug?

189
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:18,640
Or a homerun?

190
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:19,520
No way!

191
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:20,840
Not at all

192
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:22,320
But you know

193
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:23,640
I can do hugging

194
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:29,840
but an awkward one where you slightly put your arms around with your back hunched instead of a tight hug

195
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:32,940
You know what I mean

196
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:35,400
Aren’t you asking someone out if you hug that person?

197
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:36,340
What?

198
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,660
I tend to think that once you hold hands you are in a relationship with that person

199
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:40,340
Okay, okay okay.

200
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:45,420
JEONG HYUN-JIN THINKS THE EXPERIATION DATE FOR LOVE IS _____ YEARS

201
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:48,560
You seem like a person who believes in pure love.

202
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,660
10 years?

203
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:51,600
10 years?

204
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,100
Your glass is empty

205
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:57,500
I think there isn’t one

206
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,020
No expiration date?

207
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:01,560
Actually my father is very romantic

208
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:04,200
so he’s my ideal type

209
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,720
Really? What is he like?

210
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:08,540
Til this day my mom never carries her own bag

211
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:10,300
And he always opens the car door for her

212
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:13,260
So when I see someone being that romantic

213
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,600
Am I being suddenly too serious? Anyway..

214
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,420
Ok, ok that’s fine

215
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:18,520
So yeah I don’t think there is an expiration date for love.

216
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:19,080
That’s cool

217
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:20,940
So I’d like a love like a companionship

218
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:23,140
I like that

219
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:24,380
Take the card

220
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:25,840
Oh, it’s the last one

221
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:35,360
JEONG HYUN-JIN FEELS THE SAME / DIFFERENTLY ABOUT PARK JIN-HO NOW COMPARED TO THE FIRST MOMENT

222
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,680
Not the same

223
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:37,500
So not the same

224
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:38,080
Yep

225
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:39,860
Based on the conversation we had today,

226
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:41,940
I think you’re a nice person

227
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:46,660
How about me?

228
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:48,800
Do you prefer me at the very first moment or now?

229
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:51,500
I prefer now

230
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:56,320
As I’m talking to you, you seem like a bubbly person

231
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:58,900
I like that you’re lively

232
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:02,500
Glad to hear that

233
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,200
Do you have anything you’d like to ask one last time?

234
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:10,860
So you work at night

235
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:14,060
If so, how often do you usually see each other?

236
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:15,360
If I have a girlfriend?

237
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,220
Yes

238
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:18,900
I would usually see her at least twice a week

239
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:21,860
Twice or 3 times per week

240
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:23,980
Now you ask me!

241
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:24,740
So your curiosity’s all solved?

242
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:26,100
I just wanted to know

243
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:27,300
You just wanted to know

244
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:32,640
Let’s say you have a boyfriend

245
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,460
who works night shifts

246
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:37,120
and he usually gets off work at midnight or 1 am

247
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,720
How would you feel about that?

248
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:41,820
I would respect his work-life

249
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:43,160
but I have to sleep early

250
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:44,440
You sleep early?

251
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:49,520
What if he has 2 days off a week

252
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:52,820
So then it’s negotiable?

253
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:53,320
Yes

254
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,640
I don’t have classes on Friday too

255
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:55,720
Fridays?

256
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:57,220
that’s cool

257
00:08:58,340 --> 00:08:59,240
Great

258
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,180
Toast?
