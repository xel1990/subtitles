34
00:01:32,408 --> 00:01:33,775
26? okay

35
00:01:33,776 --> 00:01:34,744

00:01:34,745 --> 00:01:35,745
I'm 22

37
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:38,414
What?

38
00:01:39,548 --> 00:01:40,615
Why?

39
00:01:41,149 --> 00:01:42,149
22? -yes.

40
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:44,984
Oh okay

41
00:01:45,918 --> 00:01:46,918
Do I look much older?

42
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,668
No, no it's not that 

43
00:01:48,669 --> 00:01:49,669
[The other person doesn't know whether I pressed the button.]
-Oh...

44
00:01:50,568 --> 00:01:54,133
[Q. Why did you press the button as soon as you heard age of the other one]
We have quite an age difference

45
00:01:54,134 --> 00:01:57,800
I was just a little surprised so I clicked the unlike button

46
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:00,700
What do you do usually?

47
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:02,034
You are a student then?

48
00:02:02,768 --> 00:02:04,334
Yeah, I took a semester off

49
00:02:04,568 --> 00:02:06,802
and the military?

50
00:02:10,468 --> 00:02:13,334
Do we have to talk about military here? -I'm sorry

51
00:02:16,568 --> 00:02:18,602
Oh, okay

52
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:22,000
[How about a unfulfilled blind date partner ?]
I usually meet someone older or of the same age

53
00:02:22,167 --> 00:02:23,935
if he was not done with the military yet

54
00:02:24,035 --> 00:02:28,435
I wasn't sure if I could do it

55
00:02:29,199 --> 00:02:32,032
Oh no, I just asked because you were so young

56
00:02:32,033 --> 00:02:33,234
Yes I still need to go to the military

57
00:02:33,235 --> 00:02:34,235

00:02:34,835 --> 00:02:37,402
[If one more light of  Sulgi goes out, blind date is forced to quit]

did you do many blind dates?

61
00:02:45,869 --> 00:02:49,003
Not many just a couple?

62
00:02:49,337 --> 00:02:50,337
I don't know

63
00:02:51,205 --> 00:02:52,972
I haven't done much either

64
00:02:53,333 --> 00:02:56,467
of these kind of blind dates

65
00:02:58,435 --> 00:03:00,099
are you good at talking like this?

66
00:03:00,433 --> 00:03:02,867
Yeah I'm usually friendly

67
00:03:05,234 --> 00:03:07,000
just a little bit awkward 

68
00:03:10,401 --> 00:03:11,735
What do you do usually?

69
00:03:11,736 --> 00:03:13,203
just normally? -yeah

70
00:03:13,501 --> 00:03:15,399
I am working these days

71
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,734
What kind of work?

72
00:03:16,834 --> 00:03:18,567
I'm going to graduate school these days

73
00:03:19,034 --> 00:03:23,600
and I had a class with elementary school kids today

74
00:03:24,534 --> 00:03:26,834
so I teach them

75
00:03:26,902 --> 00:03:27,902
You're a teacher?

76
00:03:28,203 --> 00:03:30,537
Oh no just

77
00:03:31,305 --> 00:03:34,039
a class about theater

78
00:03:34,202 --> 00:03:37,367
in a camp during the vacation

79
00:03:37,368 --> 00:03:38,835
so I was doing that

80
00:03:39,267 --> 00:03:41,633
What kind of theme?

81
00:03:42,434 --> 00:03:45,134
We were making a short scene

82
00:03:45,234 --> 00:03:47,567
with fairy-tales in English

83
00:03:47,568 --> 00:03:49,568
like a musical

84
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:51,301
Today the kids wanted to do

85
00:03:51,403 --> 00:03:54,400
10 more minutes

86
00:03:54,401 --> 00:03:58,667
I was really proud that they asked

87
00:03:59,235 --> 00:04:01,099
[What is the reason you pressed the 'like it' button]
I like kids too

88
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:04,400
so I thought we had something in common

89
00:04:04,401 --> 00:04:08,335
that's why I clicked the like button

90
00:04:08,336 --> 00:04:09,203
[10 minutes after the blind date]

91
00:04:09,534 --> 00:04:11,167
Is there 

92
00:04:11,168 --> 00:04:13,533
a specific type of person that you like?

93
00:04:13,534 --> 00:04:14,534
Someone who is not faking 

94
00:04:16,002 --> 00:04:19,870
and who is cute

95
00:04:20,337 --> 00:04:22,204
Any celebrity that you like?

96
00:04:22,205 --> 00:04:24,373
I'm really into this show 'Secretary Kim' these days

97
00:04:24,374 --> 00:04:25,937
Park Minyoung? -Yeah

98
00:04:26,369 --> 00:04:27,369
I like Park Seojun

99
00:04:29,337 --> 00:04:30,673
He's really wow 

100
00:04:30,674 --> 00:04:31,673
You admit that he's pretty cool

101
00:04:31,674 --> 00:04:32,374
Even when for a guy

102
00:04:32,375 --> 00:04:33,476
and Park Minyoung too

103
00:04:33,844 --> 00:04:35,044
Have you watched Mr. Sunshine?

104
00:04:35,045 --> 00:04:36,045
Yeah that too

105
00:04:36,313 --> 00:04:37,813
[No way]

106

[Sulgi pressed the 'like it' button]

107
00:04:40,472 --> 00:04:42,300
We liked the same TV shows

108
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:46,100
I like TV shows 

109
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:48,534
so I thought that we had something in common

110
00:04:48,702 --> 00:04:50,437
The script is so well written

111
00:04:50,438 --> 00:04:51,706
and the acting is excellent too

112
00:04:52,207 --> 00:04:54,307
Definitely, Mr. Sunshine is great

113
00:04:56,675 --> 00:04:58,042
What is your blood type?

114
00:04:58,310 --> 00:04:59,033
What do you think it is?

00:04:59,033 --> 00:05:00,033
B?

116
00:05:00,034 --> 00:05:01,335
Nope

117

O?

118
00:05:03,538 --> 00:05:05,070
Wrong again -AB?

119
00:05:05,072 --> 00:05:06,139
Yeah

120
00:05:06,373 --> 00:05:10,407
I thought so, you were friendly

121
00:05:10,509 --> 00:05:13,143
Yeah AB types are cool

122
00:05:13,569 --> 00:05:15,769
What is?

123
00:05:15,770 --> 00:05:17,170
What kind of aspects? -I like AB types

124
00:05:17,171 --> 00:05:20,604
Yeah these people are cool

00:05:20,605 --> 00:05:22,340
Are you type B? -No

126

A? -Yes

127
00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:24,741
Yay

128
00:05:24,776 --> 00:05:25,976
I'm not timid or anything

129
00:05:25,977 --> 00:05:28,212
That's just a stereotype that 

130

[Sulgi pressed the 'like it' button]
type As are timid

131
00:05:30,379 --> 00:05:33,546
I'm not sure you remember but you clicked the like button when you were talking about blood types

132
00:05:34,181 --> 00:05:35,269
Did I?

133
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:37,173
I wonder why

134
00:05:39,138 --> 00:05:40,304
No I know why

135
00:05:40,502 --> 00:05:42,101
He laughed a lot 

136
00:05:42,401 --> 00:05:45,168
-He did? -Yeah

137
00:05:45,235 --> 00:05:46,235
hmm

138
00:05:47,335 --> 00:05:50,169
After a topic there was a silence

139
00:05:57,102 --> 00:06:00,302
Another topic...

140
00:06:03,836 --> 00:06:04,836
[Sulgi pressed the 'hate it' button]

141
00:06:05,701 --> 00:06:10,765
We had a lot of silences and every time I felt like

142
00:06:11,001 --> 00:06:13,366
I had to start a conversation

143
00:06:13,701 --> 00:06:20,168
and I clicked the dislike button when I thought that It would be nice if he could start a conversation

144
00:06:20,201 --> 00:06:23,534
we had a few bumps with the silences

145
00:06:23,534 --> 00:06:29,236
and I think she didn't quite like me for that

146
00:06:30,667 --> 00:06:32,832
[15 minutes before the blind date]
It's so hot,

147
00:06:33,234 --> 00:06:38,568
 it's the first time that Korea is this hot -Yeah me too

148
00:06:38,570 --> 00:06:41,538
But every year it's so much hotter

149
00:06:41,635 --> 00:06:44,402
Like every year it's a new record -Yeah

150
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:47,339
-I seriously feel like 

151
00:06:47,341 --> 00:06:49,140
[What destruction]
the world is coming to an end 

152
00:06:49,142 --> 00:06:50,142
All of a sudden?

153
00:06:50,236 --> 00:06:51,736
Yeah -We're talking about the end of the world now?

154
00:06:51,837 --> 00:06:52,837
Don't you think that it will though?

155
00:06:52,938 --> 00:06:53,938
Mmm

156
00:06:54,168 --> 00:06:59,502
Think about it, is it too weird?

157
00:06:59,504 --> 00:07:03,904
They say they found water on Mars

158
00:07:03,967 --> 00:07:08,202
Will it be faster to live on Mars or for Earth to end?

159
00:07:17,066 --> 00:07:21,866
Oh wow I never thought about it -Really?

160
00:07:22,134 --> 00:07:24,001
What do you think?

161
00:07:24,067 --> 00:07:28,435
I think about it a lot,

162
00:07:28,799 --> 00:07:30,599
I feel like there would be other galaxies so

163
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:33,902
-so there would be an Earth elsewhere?

164
00:07:34,001 --> 00:07:35,435
Something like that?

165
00:07:35,437 --> 00:07:39,903
So there would be something similar to humans

166
00:07:40,104 --> 00:07:44,400
or even better

167
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,400
[Jongwo pressed the 'hate it' button]

168
00:07:46,433 --> 00:07:50,233
Am I here on a blind date or at a lecture?

169
00:07:50,334 --> 00:07:55,768
I was thinking about that so it was a little awkward

170
00:07:56,634 --> 00:07:59,234
What is your dating style?

171
00:07:59,334 --> 00:08:03,068
I do everything for them -Oh wow

172
00:08:03,301 --> 00:08:07,835
Not only just things but I am full in

173
00:08:08,037 --> 00:08:12,171
when I'm in a relationship

174
00:08:12,398 --> 00:08:18,765
So after a while they say that I am more like a friend

175
00:08:20,234 --> 00:08:21,034
That's exactly the same

176
00:08:21,135 --> 00:08:22,336
for me too

177
00:08:22,370 --> 00:08:26,437
I do many things for them 

178
00:08:26,602 --> 00:08:31,370
and at the end they say that I am like a mother

179
00:08:31,404 --> 00:08:34,572
Yeah something like that

180
00:08:34,733 --> 00:08:37,134
I like taking care of people

181
00:08:37,434 --> 00:08:39,468
When she said 

182
00:08:39,469 --> 00:08:42,269
[Q. What is the reason you pressed the 'hate it' button]
'like a mother' 

183
00:08:42,367 --> 00:08:46,034
I know that she meant she took care of people

184
00:08:46,135 --> 00:08:49,834
but I hope that a girl friend is like a girl friend

185
00:08:49,934 --> 00:08:54,334
that would be better

186
00:08:56,501 --> 00:08:59,435
[When one of the two lights goes out, a blind date is force to quit]
How lenient are you 

187
00:08:59,435 --> 00:09:03,400
with your boy friend? 
-As in?

188
00:09:03,401 --> 00:09:11,468
If they meet a friend who is a girl, or if they go drinking or clubbing?

189
00:09:11,834 --> 00:09:20,235
I don't think I'd say okay to clubbing

190
00:09:20,468 --> 00:09:22,634
I like clubbing...

191
00:09:22,801 --> 00:09:33,335
I go there often when I'm with friends to listen to music

192
00:09:33,469 --> 00:09:37,703
Do you go often?

193
00:09:38,837 --> 00:09:40,939
Today too?

194
00:09:43,406 --> 00:09:46,239
No not often

195
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,874
See?

196
00:09:47,875 --> 00:09:51,010
I understand that it's fun

197
00:09:51,011 --> 00:09:59,834
but he was not really finishing his sentence 

198
00:10:01,002 --> 00:10:04,703
and he felt a little too young

199
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:08,834
I think the last time I went out was last week?

200
00:10:11,568 --> 00:10:13,901
[Sulgi pressed the 'hate it' button]
Is that too often?

201
00:10:14,170 --> 00:10:16,136
Oh how often do you go usually?

202
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:22,837
[The blind date failed.]

203
00:10:26,367 --> 00:10:30,234
I was a little surprised

204
00:10:30,335 --> 00:10:32,101
that she was so upset

205
00:10:32,136 --> 00:10:34,569
I shouldn't have mentioned it

206
00:10:34,968 --> 00:10:38,640
Thanks 

207
00:10:38,641 --> 00:10:39,675
Yeah thank you

208
00:10:47,001 --> 00:10:51,233
[Q. How was your blind date today?]
I was a little nervous

209
00:10:51,535 --> 00:10:55,568
and I wonder what she didn't like about me

210
00:10:56,102 --> 00:10:59,268
and what she did like

211
00:10:59,501 --> 00:11:04,401
I think he's a really good person

212
00:11:04,735 --> 00:11:10,934
but I guess it would be better for him to meet someone with more similarities

213
00:11:10,935 --> 00:11:15,635
