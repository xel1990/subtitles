They try on both

83
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:45,900
Ho-Joon was embarrassed by Se-hui's praise.

00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,040
I think it's better to buy same one

87
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,280
They are making little concessions.

88
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,060

I think we're getting along well.

92
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:05,980
It's not easy even with 20s

93
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:08,580
could be stubborn.

94
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:13,000
Right, for example I choose it, but mate could hate it... or bad feeling about my decision

95
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:16,060
what was the Ho-joon's story that hard to tell Se-Hui first?

96
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:22,000
Well, Don't use Honorific

97
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,180
Was it uncomfortable?

98
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:24,400
Okay...

99
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,880
What? I lose again!

00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:29,060
Right? Ho-Joon said it first!

101
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,320
He was careful about say something

102
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,960
Let's don't use honorific

103
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,680

104
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:38,840

172
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:21,540
Next time you should win

173
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:28,180
when we wear couplet-shirts

174
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:33,900
It was first time that I wear same cloting with someone

175
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:36,740
So I think we getting closer I think

176
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:39,180
and more friendly

177
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:43,160

179
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:47,700
Our couple t-shirts is fit well to her

180
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,920
We also love fashion

181
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,160
So I think because of her, clothing is more shine and awesome
