00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,920
IN A RELATIONSHIP, YASTA THINKS SIZE IS IMPORTANT OR NOT IMPORTANT

2
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:06,420
I think you will consider it as an important factor.

3
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:08,400
How much you love is more important.

4
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:09,800
I'm okay if size matters.

5
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:11,600
Ha! You're confident.

6
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:13,200
Of course.

7
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:24,780
Oh, Hello.

8
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:28,360
Can you speak Korean?

9
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:29,240
Yes.

10
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:30,400
What a surprise.

11
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:32,200
What is your name?

12
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:34,400
My name is Yasta

13
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:36,260
I am Ma Dae Woong.

14
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:37,100
Ma Dae Woong.

15
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:38,740
What is your age?

16
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:40,780
I am 27 years old.

17
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:42,160
Oh so you are a Nuna?

18
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:44,000
Oh no~

19
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:45,160
Let's have a shot~

20
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:46,000
Okay.

21
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:49,120
Cheers.

22
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:51,140
Nice to meet you.

23
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,500
What country do you think I'm from?

24
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:57,740
Pakistan?

25
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:00,780
No. I'm from Nepal.

26
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:03,480
Oh. Nepal! When did you come to Korea?

27
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:04,440
7 years ago.

28
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:06,700
Oh, you're very good at speaking Korean. Nuna~

29
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:08,620
Let's talk casually. Okay?

30
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:11,660
Talk casually?

31
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:13,900
Okay. Let's talk casually.

32
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:15,600
Wow, you're very good at transitioning?

33
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:17,680
I hope you don't think I'm being rude.

34
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:18,700
Nah, nah.

35
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:20,780
It's just a game right?

36
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:21,740
Right. It is.

37
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:24,200
What month were you born in 1993?

38
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:25,300
September

39
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:27,640
Oh not that much of a difference. Am I wrong?

40
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:28,720
What month were you born in 1992?

41
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:29,460
December.

42
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:31,060
December?

43
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:32,300
So about a year.

44
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:33,760
So that’s about 9 month difference.

45
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:35,700
Guess we're like friends.

46
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:37,900
Let's be friends.

47
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:43,520
YASTA'S FAVORITE KOREAN FOOD IS ________.

48
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:45,160
Kimchi Stew.

49
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:45,860
Wrong!

50
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:48,320
Spicy Braised Pork.

51
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:50,200
Spicy Braised Pork?

52
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:51,600
Do you like it?

53
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:53,840
I can't eat spicy food well.

54
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:58,700
Usually, Koreans eat spicy food well, why can't you?

55
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:00,500
I think it's because of my body type.

56
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:02,440
I sweat a lot. I have a high body temperature.

57
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:03,400
I'm a very hot guy.

58
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:08,580
So I like sushi, pork cutlet,

59
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:09,760
and Gae-bul

60
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:11,020
What is Gae-bul?

61
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:14,580
*motions*

62
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:16,400
How would I know from that?

63
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,900
Oh yeah?

64
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:19,640
In English, English.

65
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:21,780
Penis Fish.

66
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:22,480
What?

67
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,000
Korean Penis Fish.

68
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,100
Like a tes******.

69
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:27,780
Looks like an old dog’s tes******.

70
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:31,040
Oh, I think I can guess the what it looks litke.

71
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,240
In the tank, they're like....

72
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:34,880
Yeah, I think I've seen at seafood restaurants.

73
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:35,860
Right right?

74
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:37,840
Penis Fish

75
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,140
Why are we talking about this anyways?

76
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:41,980
I wonder too.

77
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:48,380
WHEN DAE WOONG HAS MANY RANDOM THOUGHTS, HE DOES ____ ALONE.

78
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:49,860
Alone?

79
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:51,760
What can you do alone?

80
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:54,420
Ah...

81
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,800
You sleep.

82
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:02,960
With who...?

83
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:03,780
With who?

84
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:06,120
No, not with who, not with who.

85
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:11,160
I like to write.

86
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:14,820
I like to write like poems and essays.

87
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:15,380
Ohhhh~

88
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:16,760
You don't look like you would.

89
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:22,580
What is your hobby?

90
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:26,300
I like to hang out with friends, go to places, and take pictures of each other.

91
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,960
For example, going to cafes and taking pictures.

92
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:29,900
Are you good at SNS?

93
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:31,520
I'm a pro.

94
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:33,200
I am also an Instagram Freak

95
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:35,380
like facebook and instagram

96
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:36,760
You're like an attention seeker

97
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:38,100
I'm really not an attention seeker.

98
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:40,160
Then, you must hear often you are pretty

99
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,800
Mmm, yea. I guess you can say that.

100
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:47,020
Mmm, okay.

101
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:52,600
YASTA'S IDEAL CELEBRITY IS ----------.

102
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:53,900
Song Joong Ki.

103
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:54,920
Wrong.

104
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:56,700
Drink, drink, drink.

105
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,720
Why are you lowering the hype?

106
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,340
Shut up and drink.

107
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:02,100
Yoo Seung Ho.

108
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:03,120
Ah! Yoo Seung Ho.

109
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:06,320
He's handsome, indeed.

110
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:09,560
He doesn't even know you exist.

111
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:13,700
Of course~ The celebrity you know doesn't know whether you exist or not too.

112
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:16,480
What the hell are you talking about.

113
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:21,180
Who do I resemble?

114
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:22,760
You don't resemble anyone.

115
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:24,780
I heard this at least once or twice a day.

116
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:25,800
Oh really?

117
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:26,920
Song.. Song (hint)

118
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:27,780
Song Joong Ki.

119
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:28,800
Wow!

120
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:30,300
You? Song Joong Ki?

121
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:33,680
Not even close…

122
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:37,660
When I don't talk, I heard I kinda look like him.

123
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:38,880
I don't really know.

124
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:42,120
Then you must like girl who looks like Song Hye Kyo.

125
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:43,820
What kind of logic is that?

126
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:44,920
Just kidding, just kidding.

127
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,360
Oh kidding? Nepalian joke?

128
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:46,980
yes.

129
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:49,740
Nepal joke. okay

130
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:57,640
THE FIRST THING THAT DAE WOONG SEES IN A WOMAN IS _______.

131
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:58,860
Is it face?

132
00:04:59,180 --> 00:04:59,740
Wrong.

133
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:00,960
Is it her breasts?

134
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:01,900
No.

135
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:02,560
Butt.

136
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:03,400
No.

137
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:06,860
Stop there.

138
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:08,180
Ok

139
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,420
I look at legs.

140
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:11,180
legs?

141
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:13,560
So when you first meet her, you stare at her legs?

142
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:14,840
No~

143
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:17,780
If you look at the leg first, that's kind of weird.

144
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:19,040
That's why you are perverted.

145
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,240
I see her face and go immediately down.

146
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:22,580
Then you look at her face first.

147
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:24,260
No, but more emphasis.

148
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:26,980
Not the face.

149
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:29,560
But I really look at her legs.

150
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:30,740
Perverted indeed.

151
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:31,820
I see. Okay.

152
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:33,760
If you look at the legs, are you perverted?

153
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:34,740
No, no.

154
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:48,020
IN A RELATIONSHIP, YASTA THINKS SIZE IS IMPORTANT OR NOT IMPORTANT

155
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:50,040
Umm…

156
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,980
I think you will consider it as an important factor

157
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:54,880
Drink.

158
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:56,280
It's not important?

159
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:56,900
Drink.

160
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:57,880
Oh really?

161
00:05:58,540 --> 00:05:59,720
Drink. Yeah why not?

162
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:03,480
Oh?

163
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:05,840
How much you love that person is more important.

164
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:07,960
But honestly, it's not important?

165
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:08,960
No.

166
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:12,080
Why? Are you sma….

167
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,460
I'm okay if size matters.

168
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:19,540
Ha! You are confident.

169
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,160
Of course.

170
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:31,980
MA DAE WOONG'S RATIO OF PAYING ON DATES IS --:--

171
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:33,780
70:30?

172
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:35,140
Yeah, you're right.

173
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:37,640
Is the woman 70, or am I?

174
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:39,240
Of course the guy is 70%

175
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:41,520
Of course?

176
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,100
No? Alright.

177
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:45,400
How about you?

178
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:47,300
What do you think?

179
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:48,940
I think 9:1

180
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:49,680
What?

181
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:50,360
8:2?

182
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:52,900
No~ it's 60:40

183
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,740
How about in Nepal?

184
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:56,600
Men in Nepal pay for almost everything.

185
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:57,740
Oh really?

186
00:06:57,740 --> 00:06:58,240
yes.

187
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,820
So it's hard to date.

188
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:02,420
So it's a little more conservative than Korea.

189
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:03,340
Yeah.

190
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:07,140
so there's this saying that a guy needs a lot of money to date.

191
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,440
I'm hearing this for the first time.

192
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:14,960
So I wasn’t surprised about Korean dating culture when I first came

193
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,840
I like to Dutch pay,

194
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:20,160
but there are more situations when the guy pays more in korea.

195
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:30,400
But I like to Dutch pay because there's less burden.

196
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:38,220
YASTA WAS IN A RELATIONSHIP FOR ----- TIMES.

197
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:39,480
Honestly...

198
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:40,460
20 times?

199
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:41,540
Well....

200
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:44,140
*whispers* How many times did I say?

201
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:45,020
(7 times)

202
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:46,180
7 times?

203
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:48,520
(You said seven times during the interview)

204
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:49,200
Oh I did?

205
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:50,720
wrong!

206
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:53,340
I'm right, right? I bet I'm right.

207
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:54,640
It's 7 times.

208
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,180
Were they all Korean?

209
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:56,900
Yes.

210
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:57,800
they were all Korean.

211
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:01,400
What do you like about Korean men?

212
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:04,460
They are fashionable.

213
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:05,880
They treat you well.

214
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:08,920
They care about you a lot.

215
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,260
So guys being considerate?

216
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:11,200
Yeah~

217
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:15,300
How many times have you dated?

218
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:17,060
They were all short.

219
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:18,240
It's okay even if they weren't long.

220
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:20,340
I have probably dated about 20 times.

221
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:22,460
Were there any foreigners?

222
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:23,620
There were, huh?

223
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:24,620
Yeah, there were.

224
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:26,780
We only went out for 2 days.

225
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:28,640
Isn't that like a one night stand?

226
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:29,820
or 2 night stand?

227
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,940
Isn’t this little too much?

228
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:34,820
It’s ok?

229
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:40,360
Since you have dated a foreigner before, are you willing to date a foreigner again?

230
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:44,480
I really don't care about ethnicity and nationality.

231
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:47,480
But I don’t think foreigners favor my looks.

232
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:52,280
sagging eyes, hooked nose, and my lips are…

233
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:53,980
You have nice lips.

234
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:56,700
I like lips like this.

235
00:08:57,660 --> 00:08:59,300
What'd you say?

236
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:02,340
Should I go to Nepal?

237
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:04,500
I think other countries are better than Nepal.

238
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,860
Was that a rejection?

239
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:09,320
You're okay, for now...

240
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:17,380
IF YASTA GOES ON A RELATIONSHIP AGAIN, SHE WANTS TO REALLY GO TO ________.

241
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:18,700
Busan?

242
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:21,260
Jeju Island.

243
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,440
Mmmmmm.

244
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:25,500
I haven't been to Jeju Island yet.

245
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:27,740
I've lived here for 7 years and still haven't been to Jeju Island.

246
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:30,020
Do you have a fantasy about Jeju Island?

247
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:31,440
Not a fantasy.

248
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:34,960
But it's just so pretty.

249
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,320
I like beaches.

250
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:38,940
So you just look at pictures?

251
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:39,840
Yeah

252
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:41,860
Like on Instagram?

253
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:44,040
Just search Jeju Island

254
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:45,560
You know, I'm similar too.

255
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:48,080
If I have a girlfriend, I always wanted to go to Jeju Island.

256
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:48,880
Oh really?

257
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,880
*laughs*

258
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:57,340
It's the last card.

259
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:05,580
COMPARED TO THE FIRST MOMENT DAE WOONG HAS SAME OR DIFFERENT FEELINGS TOWARD YASTA.

260
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:09,740
I think it's different.

261
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:10,700
Right.

262
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:17,760
I thought we wouldn't be able to communicate

263
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:22,460
because Nepal isn't a country that Koreans are familiar with.

264
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:26,120
But I think we can converse well..

265
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,260
It's comfortable?

266
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:30,200
Not exactly comfortable...

267
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:30,980
It's comfortable to me.

268
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:31,620
Oh really?

269
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:32,560
Should I...

270
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:34,460
take off my shirt?

271
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:41,320
Is your first impression of me and your current impression of me the same?

272
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:43,120
Yeah, it's the same.

273
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:46,960
From the first time, I thought it was good.

274
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:52,580
It was comfortable. Just from image.

275
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:55,980
I'm very good at reading people from first impressions.

276
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:58,300
So it's all positive?...

277
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:01,360
Yeah, that's right.

278
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:04,240
Is there any last question you want to ask me?

279
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:08,400
What are you doing after this?

280
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:12,060
*thinking*

281
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:16,060
Sounds like you're not doing anything.

282
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:18,360
There's nothing at the moment.

283
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,900
Just wondering...

284
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:24,080
How about you?

285
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:27,760
I plan to play with friends.

286
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:28,760
ah~

287
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:36,720
I'll pour you a final shot as a Nuna.

288
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,180
I'll accept.

289
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:39,000
Ok

290
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:41,960
You're welcome.

291
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,840
Cheers.
