1
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:08,620
Do you have any specific skills to calm your girlfriend when she gets upset?

2
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:15,480
I do not date anyone that comes to me.

3
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:31,240
&lt;When Yonsei Goddess of EXO-L meets good-looking guy of Dongguk univ.&gt;

4
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:35,900
[Lee, Hyun Song, 22 Years old, College Student]
Hello I am Hyun Song Lee, junior in Biotechnology

5
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:38,680
from Yonsei University and 22 years old.

6
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:44,300
[Kim, Dong Woo, 25 years old, College student]
Hello I am Dong Woo Kim, 25 years old

7
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:48,500
and majoring in Drama from Dongguk University.

8
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:51,800
Q. Your type?
My type is nice looking guy.

9
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:54,320
I would like to meet someone with seriousness but also

10
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:57,740
some wit to make me smile.

11
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:02,720
Someone proactive

12
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:04,540
I like taller girl.

13
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:08,000
-Hello

14
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,060
-Hello
-Hello

15
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:13,580
Q. How do you spend your spare time?

16
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:16,220
I prefer to stay at home.

17
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:19,860
I prefer to stay and relax at home.

18
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:22,240
I like to watch TV

19
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:25,260
or lie down lazy.

20
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:29,160
I see.

21
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:35,000
I didn’t find any similarity in that.

22
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,240
I cannot stay even a day at home doing nothing.

23
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:44,600
Q. What is your favorite food?

24
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:53,480
I have a older man’s taste in food.

25
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:56,260
I like Goodbab (Korean Soup with Rice)

26
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:00,820
He had an opposite taste from mine.

27
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:03,480
I do eat Korean food

28
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:08,420
but prefer Japanese or Western style food over Korean.

29
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,200
But he does not seem to like those.

30
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,040
Taste of food is very important for each other.

31
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:15,140
You could ask me the next question.

32
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:18,380
Q. How many long-term relationships have you had?

33
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:20,540
6

34
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:27,180
About 6 times

35
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:30,000
Q. When was the last relationship?

36
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:32,440
-The last one?

37
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:33,220
-The last one?
-Yes

38
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,620
Um.. the last relationship was

39
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:40,360
about 6 months ago.

40
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:42,460
Ah…

41
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:46,260
I hadn’t had as many long-term relationship experience as he had

42
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:48,660
So his last relationship which was 6 months ago was

43
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:50,660
quite near to now for me.

44
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:53,500
So I paused for silence.

45
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:59,280
Q. What do think is the most important in the relationship?

46
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:02,820
Meeting each other’s needs,

47
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:05,160
making sure if each other feels comfortable when together

48
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:08,060
I prefer friend-like lovers.

49
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:12,440
So I would love to share our daily life and get to know each other more

50
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:15,120
and eventually get really close to feel comfortable when together.

51
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,540
It is very important to me.

52
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:21,100
People often feel some pressure that it must be something special

53
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:24,240
when having a relationship.

54
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:27,900
I think of those pressure as a burden and unnecessary.

55
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:31,900
So I thought her response matched with my thinking.

56
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:36,080
Q. When a boyfriend is not easily reachable because he is busy,

57
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:40,400
Q. do you still ask for his obligation to contact you?

58
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:43,560
If he is not reachable because he is occupied with something,

59
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:45,700
it is of course okay.

60
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:48,880
What I’ve meant about sharing our daily life is

61
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:52,280
doing it when each other is free enough to share

62
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:54,340
where she/he goes, what she/he does,

63
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:57,400
what she/he does with her/his friends, or she/he works on her/his thesis.

64
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:01,540
Q. How many times per week do you meet your girlfriend when dating?

65
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:08,160
Meeting everyday would be hard because each has his or her own life.

66
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:14,380
Two or three times a week would suffice.

67
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:18,500
I see

68
00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:23,660
Q. Do you have any specific skills to calm your girlfriend when she gets upset?

69
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:28,560
I just become very kid like.

70
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,280
Do you mean being cute?

71
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:35,100
I intentionally play around more.

72
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:39,540
: I am being cute, which is not really expected from a person of my size.

73
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:43,960
I cannot stand those cold and silence atmosphere.

74
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:48,440
I try hard to calm her and sooth her.

75
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:51,740
Q. Are you normally being cute to your girlfriend?

76
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:55,700
I don’t usually do it.

77
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:58,360
Only when she is not feeling good?

78
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,640
I do it to make her feel better

79
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:03,400
I don’t do being cute often.

80
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:04,600
If she gets upset,

81
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,420
I intentionally touch her by her shoulder.

82
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:08,920
Keep doing it…

83
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:19,120
Q. What is your skill to make your boyfriend feel better when he gets upset?

84
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:25,940
I also do not do being cute often.

85
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:32,300
My mother also points out that I am not that lovely to her.

86
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:35,060
However if boyfriend gets upset,

87
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:39,960
I will become more cute and lovely to make him feel better.

88
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:42,620
If she is being cute to make me feel better

89
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:46,060
while she is not usually that kind of a girl,

90
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:49,900
it can be really lovely if you think about it.

91
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:55,920
So I thought of it and felt that it would be very cute and made me feel better.

92
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,160
Q. How tall are you?

93
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:01,820
I am 188CM.

94
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:04,060
You are too tall.

95
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:10,560
Do you have a preference in height?

96
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:17,760
Between 167CM and 170CM?

97
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:21,260
So you like a tall girl.

98
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,200
If you give me a choice, yes.

99
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,460
How do you like shorter girl?

100
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:29,600
I think they are cute.

101
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,520
Being shorter makes

102
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:35,320
them look cute.

103
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,620
Q. What is your height?

104
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:40,660
I am 162CM.

105
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:53,720
For me, between 167CM~170CM is very tall for a girl.

106
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:58,040
I felt a bit surprised.

107
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,320
Q. How do you feel about long distance relationship?

108
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:05,000
I live in Ilsan.

109
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:08,980
How do you think of me living in Ilsan?

110
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:11,380
If your girlfriend lives in Ilsan?

111
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:14,240
-Ilsan is not that far away.

112
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,380
-Ilsan is not that far away.
-You do not know where Ilsan is, right?

113
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:17,500
I know where it is.

114
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,080
I do not think it is that far away.

115
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,020
Ah really?

116
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:21,980
Yes.

117
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:30,780
If I ask you to come Ilsan because I have some things to sort out, would you come?

118
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,700
Of course I would.

119
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:37,320
Q. Do you do any SNS?

120
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:40,840
I do Facebook and Instagram.

121
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:43,120
Do you post a lot?

122
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Using a lot of hashtags

123
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:49,660
Putting #Followme #Daily in the end.

124
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:55,480
I just upload pictures and that is it these days.

125
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:57,020
I don’t put hashtag.

126
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,620
I feel too lazy to do that.

127
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:02,720
Posting loads of pictures and

128
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:07,680
hashtagging useless stuffs like #followme #college

129
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:09,820
are something I really do not like.

130
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:14,220
Revealing too much of self on internet?

131
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:18,320
I don’t prefer that so I asked him.

132
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:23,140
Q. Do you have any favorite idol or celebrity?

133
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:26,140
I usually do not have any interest in them.

134
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:27,960
Ah..

135
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:31,260
I am a big fan of K-POP idols.

136
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:32,800
Producer: Who is your favorite Idol?

137
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:33,960
EXO!

138
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:38,740
Producer: Whom of Exo?

139
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:41,320
I love Sehun and Baekhyun.

140
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:51,260
Q. If you like someone, do you appeal to him a lot?

141
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:53,740
I need to be with someone

142
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:55,200
I really like.

143
00:08:57,060 --> 00:09:00,340
And this means it is hard to find someone to be with.

144
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:03,780
It is of course harder for that someone to like me in same sense.

145
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:06,980
So if I think I like this guy a lot,

146
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:08,820
I appeal to him actively

147
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:12,220
by calling him and talking to him.

148
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:15,620
I like her being active.

149
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:22,480
Blind-Date Finished

150
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:25,400
Now it is a time to check each other out!

151
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:35,360
Hello

152
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:38,320
Hello

153
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:40,160
I have a hyperhidrosis on my hand.

154
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:41,680
I also have a sweaty hand.

155
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,500
What is your major?

156
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:50,440
I major in Bio-Convergence

157
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:52,000
like Bio-engineering.

158
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:56,220
Very different from what my major is.

159
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:57,940
Yes it is.

160
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:01,860
I thought it was very interesting that you are in Drama.

161
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,600
[Q. (During Blind-Date) How do you feel?]
When I first heard her voice,

162
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:11,100
I thought of someone very slim.

163
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:14,320
His voice was very low and deep.

164
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,820
I loved his voice.

165
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:21,480
She seems to have herself figured out and hold very firm opinion.

166
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:27,140
I think it is nice to be in that way.

167
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:34,380
I didn’t find that much of similarity from him.

168
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:37,540
[Q. After checking each other out, how was it?]
His look was…

169
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:41,840
His height was nice and tall.

170
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:47,420
I prefer that good guy look.

171
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:49,280
but he looked edgy.

172
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:51,940
It wasn’t all that bad though.

173
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,660
Uhm...

174
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:00,600
What I thought of first when I met her?

175
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,020
She is pretty.

176
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:03,700
I would like to see her again.
