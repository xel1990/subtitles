1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,560
KYDS Subs!

2
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:11,960
The dads are watching! My Daughters' Men Season 4!

3
00:00:12,279 --> 00:00:14,240
If my daughter wants it...

4
00:00:14,326 --> 00:00:17,599
I'll pluck a star out of the sky for you...

5
00:00:23,256 --> 00:00:26,389
The four dads who feel that way are here today.

6
00:00:26,974 --> 00:00:28,708
- Time flies, right?
- Yes, it does.

7
00:00:28,865 --> 00:00:32,583
We started out excited, and today is our last episode.

8
00:00:33,092 --> 00:00:35,365
I'm sad. I wish we could start again.

9
00:00:35,863 --> 00:00:38,247
I feel like I'm finally getting how entertainment shows work.

10
00:00:38,272 --> 00:00:41,411
You're supposed to know more about your daughter not entertainment shows.

11
00:00:41,436 --> 00:00:43,903
I'm going to need more time for that.

12
00:00:44,162 --> 00:00:47,849
Joo-yeon wrapped up things without the cameras.

13
00:00:47,874 --> 00:00:50,943
- They wrapped it up.
- They decided to take it slow.

14
00:00:51,068 --> 00:00:54,833
I wonder how thing will end for the three daughters.

15
00:00:54,858 --> 00:00:58,208
- I'm excited to find out.
- Let's take a look at the first text.

16
00:00:58,256 --> 00:01:00,656
Today is our last day for texts too.

17
00:01:02,428 --> 00:01:05,677
We got a text from the daughter and her man.

18
00:01:05,702 --> 00:01:06,702
This is so sad!

19
00:01:07,178 --> 00:01:09,193
Who said this?

20
00:01:09,349 --> 00:01:11,005
What is it?

21
00:01:11,459 --> 00:01:13,349
Please express sadness well.

22
00:01:13,374 --> 00:01:15,013
I'm totally in character right now.

23
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:16,660
Ma'am, you can go first.

24
00:01:20,521 --> 00:01:22,365
In our next lives...

25
00:01:23,928 --> 00:01:25,013
Please...

26
00:01:26,474 --> 00:01:27,458
Please stop.

27
00:01:27,529 --> 00:01:29,255
You're ruining it!

28
00:01:30,309 --> 00:01:31,841
Ready, go.

29
00:01:32,381 --> 00:01:34,181
In our next lives, let's...

30
00:01:34,928 --> 00:01:36,482
Meet on good terms..

31
00:01:36,521 --> 00:01:38,988
Did Yo-Han get his enlistment notice?

32
00:01:40,388 --> 00:01:41,818
I didn't think about that.

33
00:01:41,872 --> 00:01:44,247
But I'm sure they won't talk about next lives.

34
00:01:44,865 --> 00:01:46,880
Yo-Han stopped his song like this.

35
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:48,240
Maybe it went like this,

36
00:01:48,334 --> 00:01:50,911
"Is it okay even though I have to leave you?"

37
00:01:50,936 --> 00:01:54,037
"I think it will be hard for us in this life. Is that okay?"

38
00:01:54,099 --> 00:01:58,474
Would he write lyrics like that though and perform it in front of Seok-hee?

39
00:01:58,709 --> 00:02:00,185
Let's see who it is.

40
00:02:01,974 --> 00:02:03,458
You're good looking.

41
00:02:03,584 --> 00:02:04,919
Are they parting ways?

42
00:02:04,944 --> 00:02:06,786
- They are?
- No way!

43
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:08,559
They're parting already?

44
00:02:08,638 --> 00:02:10,572
You're good at rock climbing.

45
00:02:10,803 --> 00:02:13,255
We said Soo-bin looked happy then.

46
00:02:13,646 --> 00:02:15,929
Oh yeah, they went bungee jumping.

47
00:02:21,372 --> 00:02:22,513
What?

48
00:02:22,701 --> 00:02:24,034
He just jumped down.

49
00:02:24,435 --> 00:02:26,271
This is crazy.

50
00:02:28,053 --> 00:02:30,380
- I'm so scared.
- How do we do that?

51
00:02:31,013 --> 00:02:32,888
It's as high as a 15 floor building.

52
00:02:33,004 --> 00:02:35,738
- 50 meters.
- Wow, it's 50 meters high?

53
00:02:36,365 --> 00:02:39,552
I think they said next lives because they're jumping off.

54
00:02:39,607 --> 00:02:41,274
Oh, when they're jumping?

55
00:02:41,638 --> 00:02:44,958
I've done that before, but it was 8 meters high.

56
00:02:44,983 --> 00:02:46,516
But it got even higher.

57
00:02:46,545 --> 00:02:47,865
50 meters is...

58
00:02:51,724 --> 00:02:53,615
You're a strong kid Soo-bin.

59
00:02:54,021 --> 00:02:56,396
That's nothing for you.

60
00:02:56,459 --> 00:02:57,646
No...

61
00:02:58,638 --> 00:03:00,208
I'm speechless.

62
00:03:00,529 --> 00:03:02,138
Bungee jumping contract...

63
00:03:02,756 --> 00:03:04,568
- You didn't drink, right?
- No.

64
00:03:04,724 --> 00:03:06,232
- I'm sober.
- You're sober.

65
00:03:06,257 --> 00:03:08,029
You have to fill that out and...

66
00:03:08,084 --> 00:03:09,825
You have to check your health.

67
00:03:09,849 --> 00:03:12,082
You don't have a heart condition after looking at me?

68
00:03:12,107 --> 00:03:15,716
Did you hear that? "You don't have a
heart condition after looking at me?"

69
00:03:16,193 --> 00:03:18,536
You don't have a heart condition after looking at me?

70
00:03:19,178 --> 00:03:21,474
- I'm kidding.
- You're very shameless.

71
00:03:21,646 --> 00:03:23,980
It helps to get rid of your nerves.

72
00:03:24,326 --> 00:03:25,326
It's fun.

73
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:27,486
How do you feel?

74
00:03:27,724 --> 00:03:29,107
I feel like I'm dying.

75
00:03:29,131 --> 00:03:30,638
- Like dying?
- I can't talk.

76
00:03:30,795 --> 00:03:31,795
Really?

77
00:03:32,474 --> 00:03:34,404
- What do I do...
- Good.

78
00:03:34,638 --> 00:03:37,700
- It's okay.
- I don't think Soo-bin can do it.

79
00:03:37,794 --> 00:03:39,128
She hasn't tried it?

80
00:03:39,154 --> 00:03:40,482
Never.

81
00:03:40,654 --> 00:03:42,005
What if she cries?

82
00:03:44,482 --> 00:03:47,568
Wow, they're going up so high!

83
00:03:47,593 --> 00:03:49,005
We're jumping from here?

84
00:03:49,045 --> 00:03:50,045
Oh no!

85
00:03:50,201 --> 00:03:53,134
It's different from seeing it on the ground.

86
00:03:53,342 --> 00:03:54,808
We're going up higher?

87
00:03:56,857 --> 00:03:58,341
Do you have a fear of heights?

88
00:03:58,366 --> 00:03:59,763
I don't know! Yeah!

89
00:03:59,951 --> 00:04:01,107
They're holding hands.

90
00:04:01,138 --> 00:04:04,404
You start relying on each other
in scary situations.

91
00:04:04,429 --> 00:04:06,302
I don't think Soo-bin will be able to do it.

92
00:04:06,327 --> 00:04:08,935
- I don't think she can.
- She's shaking for real.

93
00:04:13,506 --> 00:04:14,506
Let's go.

94
00:04:17,482 --> 00:04:19,349
We're jumping off from here?

95
00:04:19,974 --> 00:04:22,669
- You can't jump off right now!
- Hee-chul!

96
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:24,552
It looks scary even from here.

97
00:04:24,607 --> 00:04:25,810
Look at that!

98
00:04:26,115 --> 00:04:27,382
Look at the ground.

99
00:04:27,407 --> 00:04:29,340
We're going to jump off here.

100
00:04:30,053 --> 00:04:31,053
In real life...

101
00:04:31,162 --> 00:04:32,562
I'm getting sick too.

102
00:04:36,224 --> 00:04:39,607
For couples, the guy as to carry the girl.

103
00:04:39,632 --> 00:04:41,747
Will you be jumping off individually or as a couple?

104
00:04:41,795 --> 00:04:43,328
- As a couple.
- Okay.

105
00:04:43,568 --> 00:04:45,107
They're doing it together?

106
00:04:45,154 --> 00:04:46,404
Couple bungee jumping?

107
00:04:46,429 --> 00:04:49,708
You have to stick your face close to his.

108
00:04:49,896 --> 00:04:52,083
If you don't, you guys can bump into each other.

109
00:04:52,115 --> 00:04:53,904
Yeah, their heads will bump into each other.

110
00:04:53,929 --> 00:04:55,872
- This is upsetting me.
- Why?

111
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:59,685
They can just hug each other and jump off.

112
00:05:00,037 --> 00:05:03,857
But the guy has to carry a girl in that situation.

113
00:05:04,005 --> 00:05:06,471
I've never seen you like this before.

114
00:05:06,615 --> 00:05:08,146
They should just hold hands.

115
00:05:08,171 --> 00:05:10,304
They should just hug each other.

116
00:05:10,329 --> 00:05:13,810
If you hug like this, your heads will bump together as you fall.

117
00:05:13,865 --> 00:05:14,932
It's for safety.

118
00:05:14,998 --> 00:05:17,638
I wish I were younger so I can try it.

119
00:05:17,873 --> 00:05:19,473
That was out of nowhere.

120
00:05:19,717 --> 00:05:20,917
What a plot twist.

121
00:05:24,834 --> 00:05:27,622
You guys stand here.

122
00:05:30,545 --> 00:05:32,078
It's making me nervous.

123
00:05:32,114 --> 00:05:35,232
What if Joo-min lets go of her because he gets tired?

124
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:37,825
That means he doesn't care about her.

125
00:05:37,974 --> 00:05:40,908
But I think he'll protect her until the end.

126
00:05:41,255 --> 00:05:42,914
We're really jumping off?

127
00:05:43,208 --> 00:05:44,990
We really need to jump off.

128
00:05:45,037 --> 00:05:46,224
Please lift her up.

129
00:05:46,717 --> 00:05:48,050
In our next lives...

130
00:05:48,076 --> 00:05:49,286
Oh, this is it.

131
00:05:49,326 --> 00:05:50,966
This is where it's from.

132
00:05:51,037 --> 00:05:52,544
In our next lives...

133
00:05:52,841 --> 00:05:54,021
let's please...

134
00:05:54,279 --> 00:05:56,240
meet on good terms.

135
00:05:59,248 --> 00:06:01,448
You just need to hug him tightly.

136
00:06:04,053 --> 00:06:05,450
Try lifting her up now.

137
00:06:05,475 --> 00:06:06,552
Good.

138
00:06:06,779 --> 00:06:07,747
One, two, three...

139
00:06:07,772 --> 00:06:10,247
The girl has to stick tightly to him so they don't get hurt.

140
00:06:10,272 --> 00:06:12,677
She can't see, so she just needs to close her eyes.

141
00:06:12,724 --> 00:06:14,302
She just needs to trust him.

142
00:06:14,327 --> 00:06:15,544
What is she going to do?

143
00:06:15,599 --> 00:06:18,482
Whether Joo-min lets go or not is very important.

144
00:06:18,507 --> 00:06:21,372
Joo-min is very brave.

145
00:06:22,131 --> 00:06:25,397
If they step wrong, they'll jump off without the hassle.

146
00:06:26,536 --> 00:06:29,013
Isn't Joo-min awesome?

147
00:06:29,038 --> 00:06:30,571
Are we really doing it?

148
00:06:35,029 --> 00:06:36,029
What's wrong?

149
00:06:39,442 --> 00:06:41,318
Is there anything you want to say to her?

150
00:06:41,343 --> 00:06:44,779
I want to die right now.

151
00:06:45,295 --> 00:06:48,428
Ahn Soo-bin is a goat!

152
00:06:48,841 --> 00:06:50,174
What does that mean?

153
00:06:50,217 --> 00:06:51,818
It means greatest of all time.

154
00:06:51,843 --> 00:06:53,376
I'm getting scared too.

155
00:06:53,401 --> 00:06:55,622
I can't believe he said that in that situation.

156
00:06:55,701 --> 00:06:58,654
If the girl said she was scared, I'd be like,
"I'm scared too!

157
00:06:58,732 --> 00:07:01,966
"Please stop moving!"

158
00:07:02,092 --> 00:07:04,763
You can't lie up there.
You speak the truth.

159
00:07:04,834 --> 00:07:07,880
- That's right.
- I think Joo-min likes Soo-bin a lot.

160
00:07:08,013 --> 00:07:10,794
Ahn Soo-bin is the prettiest girl in the world!

161
00:07:12,215 --> 00:07:13,216
Here we go.

162
00:07:13,263 --> 00:07:14,930
He's going to count down!

163
00:07:18,138 --> 00:07:19,888
Will they be able to jump on their first try.

164
00:07:19,913 --> 00:07:22,896
- It will be hard if they don't.
-  I think Joo-min will do it.

165
00:07:31,107 --> 00:07:32,107
Let's see.

166
00:07:50,162 --> 00:07:52,841
Wow! That's crazy!

167
00:08:05,448 --> 00:08:08,588
- He's grabbing her with his legs.
- They became like this.

168
00:08:09,221 --> 00:08:10,526
That's crazy.

169
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:12,870
Are you okay?
We can do it.

170
00:08:12,972 --> 00:08:14,638
It's okay. Hang in there.

171
00:08:15,245 --> 00:08:16,698
Good job.

172
00:08:16,722 --> 00:08:18,526
That was really awesome!

173
00:08:19,049 --> 00:08:20,495
That was amazing.

174
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:23,719
Sir, when they came
down, Joo-min comforted

175
00:08:23,743 --> 00:08:27,095
Soo-bin and didn't let
go of her until the end.

176
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:30,133
- He's a real man.
- Didn't you see a new side of him?

177
00:08:30,367 --> 00:08:32,532
Joo-min is amazing, but Soo-bin is amazing too.

178
00:08:32,557 --> 00:08:33,557
For real.

179
00:08:33,587 --> 00:08:35,485
We feel like we're the ones who jumped.

180
00:08:35,510 --> 00:08:39,703
You know the chills you get when you're falling down?

181
00:08:39,790 --> 00:08:40,790
Yeah.

182
00:08:40,815 --> 00:08:43,516
- They're already doing that?
- Of course.

183
00:08:43,868 --> 00:08:46,047
He needs to comfort her.

184
00:08:49,328 --> 00:08:50,797
Give me your hand.

185
00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:55,969
She became pale.

186
00:08:55,994 --> 00:08:57,394
Your knees give away.

187
00:08:57,493 --> 00:09:00,102
- Do you like bungee jumping?
- I'll never do it.

188
00:09:00,461 --> 00:09:01,446
Hold on.

189
00:09:01,563 --> 00:09:04,496
What are you doing in the middle of filming?

190
00:09:06,406 --> 00:09:10,735
I'm the one who's doing it now because you're not telling me to do it anymore.

191
00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:12,123
He's used to it now.

192
00:09:16,016 --> 00:09:17,483
What am I going to do?

193
00:09:17,532 --> 00:09:18,375
She's too...

194
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:20,633
She can't calm down because she was so scared.

195
00:09:20,658 --> 00:09:21,875
It's still lingering.

196
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:25,469
And I bet she feels a sense of accomplishment for doing it.

197
00:09:25,899 --> 00:09:28,313
Look at how his thumbs are moving.

198
00:09:28,423 --> 00:09:30,203
His thumbs keep moving.

199
00:09:30,843 --> 00:09:32,086
Mom, I went bungee jumping.

200
00:09:32,133 --> 00:09:33,789
You'd do this only once in your life time.

201
00:09:33,813 --> 00:09:34,813
Mom...

202
00:09:35,095 --> 00:09:36,750
You crossed one off your bucket list.

203
00:09:36,766 --> 00:09:39,532
- It was on my bucket list.
- Me too.

204
00:09:39,836 --> 00:09:42,369
I think it's worthwhile to do it once.
Isn't it okay?

205
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:43,500
It was meaningful.

206
00:09:43,548 --> 00:09:45,014
It's a new experience.

207
00:09:55,688 --> 00:09:58,500
When he lifted her up and jumped off,

208
00:09:58,634 --> 00:10:01,664
his eyes said, "I've got to protect this girl."

209
00:10:01,689 --> 00:10:06,032
Every guy would feel that way when he's with someone he likes.

210
00:10:06,204 --> 00:10:08,164
He said she's the prettiest
girl in the world.

211
00:10:08,195 --> 00:10:10,782
- He's happy.
- Yes, he's very proud.

212
00:10:13,297 --> 00:10:14,789
Where is that? A ship?

213
00:10:15,813 --> 00:10:18,711
- They go only to nice places.
- They're going to keep talking about it.

214
00:10:18,736 --> 00:10:20,891
- Yeah, it's very memorable.
- Seriously.

215
00:10:21,516 --> 00:10:23,516
We went after rock climbing...

216
00:10:24,845 --> 00:10:26,688
The atmosphere is really nice here.

217
00:10:26,713 --> 00:10:28,180
The night lights are really pretty.

218
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:29,735
Yeah, it's nice.

219
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:34,110
The night lights are pretty,
and the girl sitting in front of me is pretty too.

220
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:37,016
Joo-min thinks she's really pretty.

221
00:10:37,041 --> 00:10:38,969
That's what makes girls happy.

222
00:10:39,016 --> 00:10:41,391
When the guy does that.

223
00:10:43,868 --> 00:10:44,868
It's hot.

224
00:10:46,492 --> 00:10:47,774
Wow, that sound!

225
00:10:50,329 --> 00:10:51,862
That looks really good.

226
00:10:54,414 --> 00:10:55,422
Eat.

227
00:10:59,282 --> 00:11:00,282
Is it good?

228
00:11:00,307 --> 00:11:03,094
Of course it's good when he's taking care of her like that.

229
00:11:03,173 --> 00:11:04,706
It must be really good.

230
00:11:04,970 --> 00:11:06,103
It's good, right?

231
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:08,867
I think this is the best barbeque I've ever had.

232
00:11:08,892 --> 00:11:10,860
- Am I grilling it well?
- You're the best.

233
00:11:10,885 --> 00:11:11,886
That's good.

234
00:11:11,992 --> 00:11:13,192
What can't you do?

235
00:11:13,282 --> 00:11:14,349
What can't I do?

236
00:11:14,563 --> 00:11:16,097
Not treating you right.

237
00:11:19,368 --> 00:11:21,434
How can he say stuff like that?

238
00:11:22,915 --> 00:11:24,448
Not treating you right.

239
00:11:27,579 --> 00:11:28,579
Say ah.

240
00:11:28,798 --> 00:11:30,258
He's feeding her!

241
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:33,313
They look like a couple all of a sudden.

242
00:11:33,368 --> 00:11:35,578
After bungee jumping, you get real close.

243
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:37,320
- Are you done?
- Yeah.

244
00:11:37,813 --> 00:11:39,680
Should we play a truth game?

245
00:11:39,705 --> 00:11:41,204
This sounds fun.

246
00:11:41,321 --> 00:11:44,266
I think that's the scariest game in the world.

247
00:11:44,774 --> 00:11:47,203
- I'm curious all of a sudden.
- You better prepare yourself.

248
00:11:47,251 --> 00:11:48,251
Really?

249
00:11:48,298 --> 00:11:50,680
My question can come back to me.

250
00:11:50,766 --> 00:11:53,033
And my question can go to you too.

251
00:11:53,422 --> 00:11:55,016
- Okay.
- A drinking game?

252
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,938
You have to think about it carefully..

253
00:11:56,963 --> 00:11:58,768
You go first, okay?

254
00:11:59,845 --> 00:12:00,845
Okay.

255
00:12:00,891 --> 00:12:03,563
Oh, you write down 5 questions,

256
00:12:03,891 --> 00:12:06,649
they get mixed, and one pops up randomly.

257
00:12:06,674 --> 00:12:09,391
- And you ask that question.
- There are apps for everything.

258
00:12:09,821 --> 00:12:11,088
Shake it like this.

259
00:12:12,735 --> 00:12:13,938
Her wrist snaps!

260
00:12:14,102 --> 00:12:15,569
Her wrists are very...

261
00:12:15,954 --> 00:12:16,954
First kiss.

262
00:12:18,751 --> 00:12:20,938
When was your first kiss?

263
00:12:23,531 --> 00:12:25,398
You asked a strong question.

264
00:12:25,524 --> 00:12:27,086
I'm very curious about this one.

265
00:12:27,111 --> 00:12:28,438
He should say, "Right now."

266
00:12:28,463 --> 00:12:31,125
Like what Soo-geun said.
Ask me when my first kiss was.

267
00:12:31,165 --> 00:12:33,898
- When was your first kiss?
- Right now.

268
00:12:35,579 --> 00:12:37,422
Isn't that really romantic?

269
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:39,140
You think it's romantic?

270
00:12:40,539 --> 00:12:43,032
I like that. You can end it well.

271
00:12:43,891 --> 00:12:46,735
I didn't have it until I was in my twenties.
For real.

272
00:12:46,851 --> 00:12:47,851
Twenties?

273
00:12:47,899 --> 00:12:50,000
He should've said he hasn't had it yet.

274
00:12:50,101 --> 00:12:51,694
He doesn't get the game.

275
00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:54,270
Then when in your twenties?

276
00:12:55,298 --> 00:12:56,774
When I was 20...

277
00:13:00,712 --> 00:13:02,344
I don't want to go into details.

278
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:04,492
When was your first kiss?

279
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:06,390
My dad will throw a fit.

280
00:13:06,415 --> 00:13:07,711
He already has many times.

281
00:13:07,751 --> 00:13:09,602
What if she says middle school?

282
00:13:09,688 --> 00:13:11,955
No. Probably when she turned 20...

283
00:13:12,345 --> 00:13:14,078
I can't really remember...

284
00:13:14,563 --> 00:13:16,492
- Can I change the question?
- Okay.

285
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:18,727
When was your last kiss?

286
00:13:18,789 --> 00:13:21,524
Yeah, the last kiss is more important than the first kiss.

287
00:13:21,549 --> 00:13:23,633
We're curious too.

288
00:13:24,743 --> 00:13:26,477
This is fun. Ask about the details.

289
00:13:26,618 --> 00:13:28,860
The world shouldn't know.

290
00:13:31,493 --> 00:13:35,844
Soo-bin has never introduced you to someone she likes?

291
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:39,164
She didn't have a boyfriend before she turned 20.

292
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:40,953
But she said that she did.

293
00:13:40,993 --> 00:13:44,117
And she said she couldn't drink soju but she did this.

294
00:13:44,173 --> 00:13:46,639
I think she's evolved a lot recently.

295
00:13:46,915 --> 00:13:49,383
- Evolved?
- She's evolved through the show.

296
00:13:50,149 --> 00:13:51,416
Let's see the clip.

297
00:13:51,915 --> 00:13:53,715
I got a question you wrote.

298
00:13:56,016 --> 00:13:57,683
Are you interested in me?

299
00:13:58,243 --> 00:14:00,310
That was a very direct question.

300
00:14:00,571 --> 00:14:02,946
I wanted to ask you that.

301
00:14:06,321 --> 00:14:07,828
I am interested in you.

302
00:14:07,907 --> 00:14:08,907
You are?

303
00:14:09,352 --> 00:14:10,352
Like how?

304
00:14:10,555 --> 00:14:12,955
Yes, he wants her to be more specific.

305
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:15,222
- "As a guy."
- I've never said this before.

306
00:14:15,274 --> 00:14:16,274
What is it?

307
00:14:18,930 --> 00:14:20,664
That I'm interested in someone.

308
00:14:20,743 --> 00:14:22,461
Why are we swallowing too?

309
00:14:23,274 --> 00:14:27,180
I'm not interested in you as just friends.

310
00:14:27,845 --> 00:14:28,845
It's more...

311
00:14:29,251 --> 00:14:30,784
His lips are drying up.

312
00:14:30,809 --> 00:14:33,586
It means I think of you as a man.

313
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:39,649
To be honest, I kept thinking about you even when I was in Da Nang.

314
00:14:39,673 --> 00:14:40,673
Really?

315
00:14:41,032 --> 00:14:45,157
You're the first girl that I kept calling and texting like that.

316
00:14:45,899 --> 00:14:49,367
Taking time to work on self growth is very important to me.

317
00:14:49,438 --> 00:14:52,891
But even when I'm working out I keep looking at my phone.

318
00:14:53,024 --> 00:14:54,024
Really?

319
00:14:54,172 --> 00:14:58,133
- That's touching.
- I want to check if you've texted or not.

320
00:14:58,384 --> 00:15:01,867
He's saying all the things Soo-bin will like.

321
00:15:02,009 --> 00:15:03,821
It means he really likes her.

322
00:15:03,915 --> 00:15:04,915
He likes her.

323
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:09,664
Why would I text and call a girl I'm not interested in?

324
00:15:09,915 --> 00:15:11,297
You're romantic.

325
00:15:11,743 --> 00:15:12,743
Thank you.

326
00:15:14,164 --> 00:15:15,964
I think they're connecting.

327
00:15:18,071 --> 00:15:20,594
This is something I want to ask you.

328
00:15:20,907 --> 00:15:22,758
This is actually my last question for you.

329
00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:24,078
- Really?
- What is it?

330
00:15:24,141 --> 00:15:25,808
Don't say it. I'm scared.

331
00:15:25,923 --> 00:15:27,992
- I'm scared too.
- What is it?

332
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:31,422
I don't think I can listen to it.

333
00:15:31,501 --> 00:15:32,634
After the show...

334
00:15:33,727 --> 00:15:35,127
I knew he'd say that.

335
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:37,983
Doesn't it sound like "Be my girlfriend?"

336
00:15:40,345 --> 00:15:44,345
Do you want to meet me a few more times and become my girlfriend?

337
00:15:44,970 --> 00:15:46,274
That was direct!

338
00:15:46,524 --> 00:15:47,758
That was cool.

339
00:15:49,657 --> 00:15:52,438
- He's handsome.
- I like him more the more I look at him.

340
00:15:52,563 --> 00:15:56,375
Do you want to meet me a few more times and become my girlfriend?

341
00:16:00,172 --> 00:16:02,914
You're really pretty.
You're pretty today too.

342
00:16:03,570 --> 00:16:07,036
Ahn Soo-bin, you're the prettiest girl in the world!

343
00:16:07,290 --> 00:16:10,141
First, you're very handsome and nice.

344
00:16:10,266 --> 00:16:11,533
You're too perfect.

345
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:15,024
This is for real.

346
00:16:15,049 --> 00:16:16,273
It's like a movie.

347
00:16:16,336 --> 00:16:19,250
This is really how the young people date these days.

348
00:16:20,735 --> 00:16:23,922
It looks like Soo-bin has fallen for him.

349
00:16:24,102 --> 00:16:25,711
- Really?
- Yeah.

350
00:16:25,798 --> 00:16:29,516
90% of her fell for him when they jumped off.

351
00:16:29,868 --> 00:16:31,668
What do you think she said?

352
00:16:32,196 --> 00:16:33,633
I think she said...

353
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:36,289
"What about you?"

354
00:16:36,314 --> 00:16:39,211
Ask the question back?
Let's see what Soo-bin said.

355
00:16:43,071 --> 00:16:44,727
Yeah, I'll meet you more times...

356
00:16:48,337 --> 00:16:51,227
and become your girlfriend if I like you.

357
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:55,360
This is nice.

358
00:16:55,509 --> 00:16:58,709
She beat around the bush because of the cameras.

359
00:17:05,352 --> 00:17:08,758
After the show ends, I'm going to keep seeing you.

360
00:17:08,821 --> 00:17:10,430
I'm going to keep calling you.

361
00:17:10,455 --> 00:17:11,313
Really?

362
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:14,524
I want to get to know Ahn Soo-bin more.

363
00:17:14,618 --> 00:17:15,618
Really?

364
00:17:16,930 --> 00:17:18,330
I'd fall for him too.

365
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:22,854
You want to try it too?

366
00:17:26,555 --> 00:17:28,680
So when are we going to see each other next?

367
00:17:28,743 --> 00:17:29,743
- Next?
- Yeah.

368
00:17:29,891 --> 00:17:32,125
- Want to meet tomorrow?
- Tomorrow!

369
00:17:33,242 --> 00:17:34,938
Okay, sounds good.

370
00:17:46,423 --> 00:17:48,133
- This is great!
- This feels good.

371
00:17:48,165 --> 00:17:53,196
Would you give your approval if they continue to date each other?

372
00:17:53,321 --> 00:17:56,813
- Joo-min has a good sense.
- Right?

373
00:17:56,977 --> 00:18:00,071
And he's motivated for his work.

374
00:18:00,173 --> 00:18:01,506
He looks dependable.

375
00:18:01,531 --> 00:18:03,922
I'd like them to have a beautiful relationship.

376
00:18:04,149 --> 00:18:05,616
We're rooting for her.

377
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:11,187
This is...

378
00:18:11,289 --> 00:18:14,664
- You have to act like you're drunk.
- Is she drunk?

379
00:18:16,493 --> 00:18:18,805
Oh, that's what she looks drunk.

380
00:18:22,555 --> 00:18:25,195
We drank a lot, huh?

381
00:18:25,485 --> 00:18:26,695
Wow!

382
00:18:26,930 --> 00:18:28,375
You're amazing!

383
00:18:28,649 --> 00:18:31,320
- It really looks like you drank.
- It looks very real.

384
00:18:31,407 --> 00:18:32,937
- Who is it?
- This sounds like Woo-ju.

385
00:18:32,962 --> 00:18:35,117
- But Woo-ju doesn't drink.
- She doesn't.

386
00:18:35,211 --> 00:18:36,890
Seok-hee wouldn't say that.

387
00:18:36,930 --> 00:18:39,273
They went on a trip to Jejudo.

388
00:18:39,446 --> 00:18:41,484
Maybe she drank a lot there.

389
00:18:41,532 --> 00:18:45,742
But their first night ended.
They should be coming home on the second day.

390
00:18:45,774 --> 00:18:48,000
Did they go for 3 days?

391
00:18:48,211 --> 00:18:51,008
- Oh yeah.
- Isn't that more of a honeymoon?

392
00:18:51,133 --> 00:18:54,742
Or Woo-ju could've drank because she likes Ki-ho.

393
00:18:54,805 --> 00:18:56,351
Yeah, because of that...

394
00:18:56,469 --> 00:18:58,269
There's no way she'd drink.

395
00:18:58,294 --> 00:19:01,125
My gosh, every time we talk about Woo-ju...

396
00:19:02,657 --> 00:19:05,969
- I hope they show her drinking a lot!
- Let's see Woo-ju's clip.

397
00:19:11,562 --> 00:19:13,414
- It's Woo-ju.
- It's Woo-ju!

398
00:19:13,439 --> 00:19:14,906
- I told you.
- Wait.

399
00:19:14,946 --> 00:19:18,212
- Woo-ju always wear this kind of stuff.
- Yeah.

400
00:19:18,875 --> 00:19:20,242
It's Woo-ju!

401
00:19:20,594 --> 00:19:21,594
It's Woo-ju!

402
00:19:21,821 --> 00:19:24,954
They all don't know much about their daughters.

403
00:19:27,305 --> 00:19:28,765
Where is that place?

404
00:19:29,429 --> 00:19:30,437
Hi.

405
00:19:31,492 --> 00:19:32,492
You're here.

406
00:19:32,532 --> 00:19:34,367
They're meeting up.

407
00:19:34,641 --> 00:19:37,174
This is your favorite, iced Americano.

408
00:19:37,199 --> 00:19:39,055
- What's this?
- Macarons.

409
00:19:39,367 --> 00:19:42,367
- How did you know I like macarons?
- Really? I got a lot.

410
00:19:43,594 --> 00:19:47,680
Bringing food on the date means she likes him, right?

411
00:19:48,008 --> 00:19:51,208
I told her to never visit anywhere empty handed.

412
00:20:00,788 --> 00:20:03,664
She's like me. She likes sweet stuff.

413
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:07,013
We haven't seen each other in days.

414
00:20:08,539 --> 00:20:10,273
I thought about you a lot.

415
00:20:12,149 --> 00:20:15,726
You look prettier today.

416
00:20:16,469 --> 00:20:18,609
No. Stop it.

417
00:20:19,508 --> 00:20:23,812
- You're good with your words.
- It's necessary.

418
00:20:24,032 --> 00:20:26,226
That's not good. That doesn't work in your favor.

419
00:20:26,266 --> 00:20:27,266
Is that so?

420
00:20:31,586 --> 00:20:34,461
- I wanted to work with you.
- Really? What is this?

421
00:20:34,493 --> 00:20:36,789
I want to build chairs today.

422
00:20:37,602 --> 00:20:38,883
- Shall we go?
- Yes.

423
00:20:43,031 --> 00:20:44,764
Let's put on aprons first.

424
00:20:47,219 --> 00:20:50,219
- What is all this?
- I prepared everything.

425
00:20:50,414 --> 00:20:55,000
It would be nice for a newlywed to build stuff together for their new home.

426
00:20:55,025 --> 00:20:56,743
And a crib.

427
00:20:57,094 --> 00:20:58,694
That would be very nice.

428
00:20:58,821 --> 00:21:01,258
This is kind of romantic.

429
00:21:01,468 --> 00:21:03,868
- How do I put it on?
- From above.

430
00:21:05,282 --> 00:21:06,282
You're good.

431
00:21:08,164 --> 00:21:09,765
- Got it.
- It looks good on you.

432
00:21:09,790 --> 00:21:12,523
- Really?
- It looks really good on you.

433
00:21:13,102 --> 00:21:15,369
The two look really good together.

434
00:21:16,368 --> 00:21:18,367
We can make two chairs with this?

435
00:21:18,406 --> 00:21:19,672
Yes, it's possible.

436
00:21:19,697 --> 00:21:21,445
Will this be able to withstand our weights?

437
00:21:21,470 --> 00:21:24,961
It's more than enough. Wood is
a lot sturdier than you'd think.

438
00:21:28,055 --> 00:21:29,242
It's sturdy.

439
00:21:29,703 --> 00:21:30,703
You're strong.

440
00:21:31,289 --> 00:21:32,289
It's study.

441
00:21:34,016 --> 00:21:36,156
I'll give you an email. Send me your resume.

442
00:21:36,181 --> 00:21:38,890
It looks like they've gotten a lot closer.

443
00:21:38,977 --> 00:21:42,367
Before we use the machines...
This makes a lot of dust.

444
00:21:42,392 --> 00:21:46,398
So there's a vacuum machine we
turn on first. It eats up the dust.

445
00:21:46,742 --> 00:21:50,570
So we'll turn this on first.
It's a little loud. Don't get scared.

446
00:21:51,703 --> 00:21:54,390
If you look here at the bottom, there is...

447
00:21:54,477 --> 00:21:56,125
What did you say?

448
00:21:58,414 --> 00:22:00,273
- That's how...
- What did you say?

449
00:22:00,711 --> 00:22:02,511
There's a switch down here.

450
00:22:03,336 --> 00:22:05,523
You get to whisper to each other.

451
00:22:05,602 --> 00:22:07,953
It's a machine that brings people close.

452
00:22:08,227 --> 00:22:09,894
That's why they're there.

453
00:22:11,243 --> 00:22:13,281
You have to push it slowly.

454
00:22:19,821 --> 00:22:22,906
- You need to watch out for your hand!
- That's scary!

455
00:22:26,062 --> 00:22:27,180
Isn't it fun?

456
00:22:27,305 --> 00:22:28,703
I want to try cutting it.

457
00:22:28,758 --> 00:22:29,758
I'll help you.

458
00:22:29,961 --> 00:22:34,336
Watch. You have to push it hard
because it bends when it's getting cut.

459
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:37,976
So you have to place your hand here, not there.

460
00:22:38,492 --> 00:22:40,484
No, you're going to get hurt.
Push from here.

461
00:22:40,532 --> 00:22:41,648
Here? Okay.

462
00:22:42,195 --> 00:22:43,578
Here.

463
00:22:46,219 --> 00:22:48,820
Lightly holding hands like that...

464
00:22:49,125 --> 00:22:50,525
- Here I go.
- Okay.

465
00:23:06,047 --> 00:23:08,539
- That's cool and amazing.
- Seriously.

466
00:23:13,586 --> 00:23:18,140
Is he trying to show off his charm by taking her to his workplace?

467
00:23:18,211 --> 00:23:19,742
Yes, totally.

468
00:23:20,243 --> 00:23:23,476
It will be memorable to gift her with a chair.

469
00:23:23,624 --> 00:23:26,091
- Even more so if you made it yourself.
- Yes.

470
00:23:26,602 --> 00:23:30,726
Woo-ju looks very happy right now.

471
00:23:30,789 --> 00:23:33,723
- I think she's interested in him.
- Right?

472
00:23:35,289 --> 00:23:37,356
We got all the materials ready.

473
00:23:38,219 --> 00:23:40,019
Shall we put them together?

474
00:23:43,141 --> 00:23:46,101
Have you taught anyone like this before?

475
00:23:47,273 --> 00:23:50,414
It's my first time making something for a girl one on one like this.

476
00:23:50,446 --> 00:23:51,446
Good job.

477
00:23:51,477 --> 00:23:52,711
That's the right answer.

478
00:23:52,736 --> 00:23:55,875
- Thank you.
- It doesn't seem like you believe me.

479
00:23:55,908 --> 00:23:56,908
I believe you.

480
00:23:57,899 --> 00:24:03,062
Imagine he said, "Yeah, I made it for a girl I loved before."

481
00:24:03,172 --> 00:24:04,578
"For 6 hours."

482
00:24:04,649 --> 00:24:06,961
"Yes, for 6 hours. And we kissed too."

483
00:24:07,125 --> 00:24:09,058
Then it would be total chaos.

484
00:24:18,891 --> 00:24:20,086
How scary!

485
00:24:21,024 --> 00:24:23,633
Shoot it like this, and it won't move.

486
00:24:23,658 --> 00:24:25,446
I see.

487
00:24:33,407 --> 00:24:35,930
He just said it won't move.

488
00:24:36,094 --> 00:24:37,094
He did.

489
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:38,893
Why didn't it come out?

490
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,067
It's coming out!

491
00:24:43,758 --> 00:24:46,515
I guess it didn't come out earlier.
It's good now.

492
00:24:48,336 --> 00:24:49,803
Can I try shooting it?

493
00:24:50,243 --> 00:24:52,101
I just shoot it like it's a gun, right?

494
00:24:52,171 --> 00:24:53,771
Yes, shoot it like a gun...

495
00:24:53,883 --> 00:24:55,898
- Hold it tight.
- I'll hold it.

496
00:24:55,923 --> 00:24:58,437
Everyone, be careful with that.
You can get hurt.

497
00:24:58,477 --> 00:24:59,477
That's scary!

498
00:25:04,219 --> 00:25:05,643
It looks like a worm.

499
00:25:06,461 --> 00:25:08,927
It looks like she's putting on sauce.

500
00:25:09,305 --> 00:25:10,705
Stop making me laugh.

501
00:25:11,274 --> 00:25:13,609
You laugh at everything at that phase.

502
00:25:13,634 --> 00:25:15,617
- It wasn't funny, right?
- It wasn't.

503
00:25:15,642 --> 00:25:21,109
That's why comedians are having a hard time right now because people laugh easily.

504
00:25:23,078 --> 00:25:24,914
They laugh at anything.

505
00:25:29,250 --> 00:25:32,578
This is how it becomes a chair.

506
00:25:39,406 --> 00:25:41,339
- Wow.
- It's simple, right?

507
00:25:41,430 --> 00:25:42,430
This is nice.

508
00:25:43,086 --> 00:25:46,286
I get to make something like this thanks to you.

509
00:25:47,422 --> 00:25:49,422
I'll give it to you as a gift.

510
00:25:51,023 --> 00:25:52,024
Okay.

511
00:26:00,906 --> 00:26:02,327
He's a good singer.

512
00:26:04,086 --> 00:26:06,773
- Seok-hee is blushing!
- Her face is red!

513
00:26:06,798 --> 00:26:08,399
Give her a kiss dang it.

514
00:26:09,141 --> 00:26:11,180
Yo-Han, you're an idiot.

515
00:26:19,586 --> 00:26:21,805
- Ki-ho reserved this place.
- What is it?

516
00:26:21,844 --> 00:26:24,111
They must be grabbing drinks here!

517
00:26:31,586 --> 00:26:34,720
I told you there was a place I wanted to visit.

518
00:26:34,875 --> 00:26:36,390
Isn't it nice sitting like that?

519
00:26:36,415 --> 00:26:38,415
This is a very unique place.

520
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:39,586
It's really unique.

521
00:26:39,610 --> 00:26:42,398
They put on a play, and we can drink.

522
00:26:42,423 --> 00:26:43,953
There's something like that?

523
00:26:43,978 --> 00:26:46,453
You usually can't drink while watching a play.

524
00:26:46,478 --> 00:26:47,945
Yeah, will it be okay?

525
00:26:48,516 --> 00:26:50,883
This is really cool.

526
00:26:52,625 --> 00:26:57,351
I wanted to have a serious conversation over drinks.

527
00:26:58,086 --> 00:27:00,351
But we can do that any time.

528
00:27:00,938 --> 00:27:06,070
I thought we could just have fun tonight.

529
00:27:07,313 --> 00:27:09,513
Is Woo-ju finally going to drink?

530
00:27:09,711 --> 00:27:10,844
Thank you.

531
00:27:10,869 --> 00:27:13,305
- The glasses are really cute.
- Yeah.

532
00:27:13,437 --> 00:27:14,633
Should we make it?

533
00:27:14,687 --> 00:27:17,297
Champagnes are okay, but stronger ones--

534
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:18,875
That's 25% abv.

535
00:27:19,258 --> 00:27:21,925
It will be hard to drink it in one shot.

536
00:27:23,194 --> 00:27:25,375
- It's that thing!
- I'm good at making those.

537
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:26,588
I mean...

538
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,383
It's good but you get very drunk.

539
00:27:31,141 --> 00:27:32,695
- Shall we do cheers?
- Okay.

540
00:27:33,688 --> 00:27:34,688
Thank you.

541
00:27:36,047 --> 00:27:37,047
Thank you.

542
00:27:37,633 --> 00:27:39,922
My goodness, look at her go.

543
00:27:40,077 --> 00:27:41,085
It's good.

544
00:27:41,618 --> 00:27:42,992
That's how you end up.

545
00:27:43,132 --> 00:27:45,866
It means that he's tried it a lot before.

546
00:27:46,524 --> 00:27:49,117
How could he drink like that when he hasn't tried it before?

547
00:27:49,180 --> 00:27:54,513
I think she's drinking because she feels comfortable, not because she likes him.

548
00:27:54,804 --> 00:27:56,219
Isn't that a good thing?

549
00:27:56,274 --> 00:27:58,874
I don't think she's totally comfortable.

550
00:28:00,008 --> 00:28:02,531
The fact that she drank means...

551
00:28:02,625 --> 00:28:03,625
She likes him.

552
00:28:04,133 --> 00:28:07,211
And she doesn't look like she has thorns in her heart at all.

553
00:28:08,141 --> 00:28:09,703
You're like a poet.

554
00:28:10,743 --> 00:28:13,234
How was furniture making?
Was it okay?

555
00:28:14,063 --> 00:28:15,289
It was fun.

556
00:28:15,719 --> 00:28:20,828
Next time, let's make a jewelry box or a small drawer like you mentioned.

557
00:28:20,906 --> 00:28:23,687
You can make patterns too.

558
00:28:24,812 --> 00:28:27,578
- I guess they're starting.
- Welcome everyone!

559
00:28:30,453 --> 00:28:32,653
Is it anyone's special day today?

560
00:28:34,679 --> 00:28:35,679
Okay.

561
00:28:36,055 --> 00:28:37,055
I...

562
00:28:38,618 --> 00:28:42,015
I went on a blind date for the first time in my life.

563
00:28:42,094 --> 00:28:43,494
His words are very...

564
00:28:44,930 --> 00:28:48,547
Every day with Woo-ju is special for Ki-ho.

565
00:28:56,188 --> 00:28:59,234
- It's a play!
- They're really putting on a play?

566
00:28:59,243 --> 00:29:00,726
I almost died.

567
00:29:01,688 --> 00:29:02,688
What's wrong?

568
00:29:02,914 --> 00:29:04,547
Bbi-bbi, are you okay?

569
00:29:04,641 --> 00:29:05,641
Yeah.

570
00:29:06,836 --> 00:29:08,359
She's really into it.

571
00:29:09,274 --> 00:29:11,297
Have you guys kissed?

572
00:29:14,133 --> 00:29:15,453
Be quiet!

573
00:29:16,297 --> 00:29:18,312
A letter? It's been returned.

574
00:29:18,407 --> 00:29:19,407
Hold on.

575
00:29:19,641 --> 00:29:22,711
I thought there was another one.
It's here somewhere...

576
00:29:22,969 --> 00:29:24,203
What the heck?

577
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:27,289
Take it. I think it's a love letter.

578
00:29:27,383 --> 00:29:29,422
Someone wrote a love letter?

579
00:29:29,594 --> 00:29:30,703
As an event?

580
00:29:30,758 --> 00:29:31,758
For real?

581
00:29:31,836 --> 00:29:33,297
They hold events for them too?

582
00:29:33,383 --> 00:29:34,594
Ki-ho wrote it?

583
00:29:36,266 --> 00:29:38,078
Did you guys enjoy the show?

584
00:29:38,157 --> 00:29:39,906
Yes! It was very fun!

585
00:29:44,313 --> 00:29:45,437
That was fun.

586
00:29:45,703 --> 00:29:47,484
- Hello.
- Hello.

587
00:29:47,616 --> 00:29:50,750
- Did you guys enjoy the show?
- Yes, it was very good.

588
00:29:51,359 --> 00:29:53,292
- You guys got the love letter.
- Yes.

589
00:29:53,391 --> 00:29:56,890
I gave it to her earlier.

590
00:29:56,915 --> 00:29:58,594
Oh, it really must be from him.

591
00:29:58,727 --> 00:30:02,527
- Ki-ho really wrote it.
- It's a special event for her.

592
00:30:16,633 --> 00:30:17,781
That's cute.

593
00:30:18,547 --> 00:30:21,614
It's better than writing something out cringy.

594
00:30:22,852 --> 00:30:25,367
I hope you guys meet 200 times more.

595
00:30:25,555 --> 00:30:27,888
We decided to come back next month.

596
00:30:28,164 --> 00:30:29,164
Really?

597
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:33,437
We look forward to it!

598
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:37,219
You should sing. You have a really nice voice.

599
00:30:37,244 --> 00:30:39,311
- He's a good singer.
- He is?

600
00:30:42,047 --> 00:30:44,445
I'll sing just a little bit.

601
00:30:58,860 --> 00:31:02,031
- He's a really good singer.
- He sings like a musical actor.

602
00:31:19,538 --> 00:31:20,805
You're really good.

603
00:31:25,907 --> 00:31:27,703
How cute.

604
00:31:27,844 --> 00:31:29,177
The two are so cute.

605
00:31:30,868 --> 00:31:34,906
So I saw you for the first time a couple of days ago.

606
00:31:36,266 --> 00:31:38,961
To be honest, you looked a little cold.

607
00:31:40,219 --> 00:31:41,219
A little cold.

608
00:31:41,977 --> 00:31:44,992
I expressed my feelings here and there.

609
00:31:46,648 --> 00:31:50,581
I was really scared that it would come back as a rejection.

610
00:31:52,015 --> 00:31:54,773
I'm not cold.

611
00:31:55,188 --> 00:31:56,859
I feel that now.

612
00:31:57,571 --> 00:32:01,037
I've had that misunderstanding so many times before.

613
00:32:03,977 --> 00:32:08,044
You can't really do anything,
because everyone has an image.

614
00:32:10,016 --> 00:32:13,125
I was very worried at first.

615
00:32:13,633 --> 00:32:17,055
But I think I'm less worried after today.

616
00:32:17,813 --> 00:32:21,508
I was really nervous today too.

617
00:32:23,422 --> 00:32:29,680
We did a lot during the time we spent together.

618
00:32:29,705 --> 00:32:32,703
- This was the first time in my life.
- Yeah, the folk village...

619
00:32:32,728 --> 00:32:34,344
and wearing hanbok for the first time.

620
00:32:34,398 --> 00:32:38,090
Doing things like that
together made you become

621
00:32:38,115 --> 00:32:41,883
special to me although it
hasn't been that long.

622
00:32:45,633 --> 00:32:48,500
We drank a lot, right?

623
00:32:49,969 --> 00:32:52,769
I'm not saying this because I drank a lot.

624
00:32:53,764 --> 00:32:56,203
You're not saying that because you're drunk, right?

625
00:32:56,289 --> 00:32:57,555
It's not like that.

626
00:32:58,110 --> 00:33:01,320
I jokingly said this after the play.

627
00:33:01,610 --> 00:33:04,164
That we'd come back in a month.

628
00:33:05,071 --> 00:33:06,305
Yeah.

629
00:33:07,141 --> 00:33:10,367
I'm a man from Gyeongsangdo.

630
00:33:11,485 --> 00:33:17,000
So it's hard for me to express myself.

631
00:33:17,797 --> 00:33:19,297
Ki-ho looks so pure.

632
00:33:19,430 --> 00:33:22,250
It only looks cool in movies.

633
00:33:22,336 --> 00:33:26,002
But telling your honest feelings drunk isn't that good.

634
00:33:26,039 --> 00:33:27,439
I think the opposite.

635
00:33:28,133 --> 00:33:34,000
You can't meet the person in the eyes if you like them a lot or talk.

636
00:33:34,025 --> 00:33:37,259
So I think he used alcohol to say his honest feelings.

637
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:41,000
But the other person can think,
"He's so drunk."

638
00:33:41,063 --> 00:33:43,015
Then it's worse than saying it sober.

639
00:33:43,047 --> 00:33:47,133
Do you like guys telling you that they like you when they're sober?

640
00:33:47,157 --> 00:33:48,492
That's the best.

641
00:33:48,844 --> 00:33:52,211
It sounds most sincere when they're sober.

642
00:33:52,282 --> 00:33:56,609
If he said it drunk, then he needs to reaffirm it the next day.

643
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:58,695
- Reaffirm it?
- Yes.

644
00:33:58,789 --> 00:34:02,203
Think about it. You shouldn't say it like that after drinking.

645
00:34:02,228 --> 00:34:05,539
You should act like you're really drunk.

646
00:34:05,999 --> 00:34:10,390
We're seeing Soo-geun's acting for the first time on this show!

647
00:34:10,415 --> 00:34:11,359
It's the best.

648
00:34:11,384 --> 00:34:13,984
You have to say it before you pass out.

649
00:34:17,077 --> 00:34:20,515
That's how you should say it.
Like it's just slipping out of your mouth.

650
00:34:20,672 --> 00:34:22,890
So it lingers?

651
00:34:23,063 --> 00:34:25,039
I didn't have the courage to say it.

652
00:34:25,110 --> 00:34:26,765
But I really like you.

653
00:34:29,070 --> 00:34:30,663
It looks a little sad.

654
00:34:30,711 --> 00:34:32,859
What do you think about Soo-geun's method?

655
00:34:32,884 --> 00:34:35,211
You feel bad for him so it's a little cute.

656
00:34:35,236 --> 00:34:36,385
It works.

657
00:34:36,410 --> 00:34:39,151
The best thing is getting drunk together.

658
00:34:41,016 --> 00:34:43,483
To be honest, the drinks are helping.

659
00:34:43,719 --> 00:34:45,319
So I think I can say it.

660
00:34:47,164 --> 00:34:48,164
I like you.

661
00:34:52,914 --> 00:34:54,000
What a man.

662
00:34:54,141 --> 00:34:57,640
I'm so happy this season because the daughters aren't getting hurt.

663
00:34:57,743 --> 00:35:00,076
And the guys don't drag things out.

664
00:35:01,703 --> 00:35:03,609
I like you.

665
00:35:23,531 --> 00:35:28,375
I want us to come back here together in a month.

666
00:35:40,141 --> 00:35:41,765
What do you think?

667
00:35:42,821 --> 00:35:45,562
There was nothing to dislike about him so far.

668
00:35:45,587 --> 00:35:46,854
Right, there isn't.

669
00:35:47,586 --> 00:35:51,120
During the play, he said they'd come back next month.

670
00:35:53,125 --> 00:35:55,125
I want to watch the next clip.

671
00:35:56,117 --> 00:35:57,961
Please play it right now!

672
00:35:57,999 --> 00:36:00,094
We'll find out more on the special episode.

673
00:36:00,141 --> 00:36:01,695
Let's take a look at the next text.

674
00:36:01,743 --> 00:36:04,781
Seok-hee and Yo-Han are the only ones left.

675
00:36:04,860 --> 00:36:05,860
Right.

676
00:36:08,032 --> 00:36:09,578
Seok-hee said something like that?

677
00:36:09,603 --> 00:36:11,336
Yo-Han must've messed up big time.

678
00:36:11,383 --> 00:36:13,716
Her texts aren't usually this long.

679
00:36:14,063 --> 00:36:16,289
Make the sunset...

680
00:36:16,617 --> 00:36:19,594
Isn't that Choi Min-soo?

681
00:36:19,727 --> 00:36:23,328
- It was close.
- That was Choi Min-soo.

682
00:36:23,915 --> 00:36:27,656
Make the sunset fall asleep and build
a bridge with the golden spirit...

683
00:36:27,696 --> 00:36:29,896
Since Seok-hee has a husky voice.

684
00:36:30,008 --> 00:36:33,275
Maybe Seok-hee is a good writer like her parents?

685
00:36:33,726 --> 00:36:35,195
- They must be lyrics.
- Yeah!

686
00:36:35,243 --> 00:36:37,055
- From his song.
- The song!

687
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:38,398
Lyrics from that song!

688
00:36:38,423 --> 00:36:40,219
Maybe she writes some at the end!

689
00:36:40,282 --> 00:36:42,188
It felt like Shin Sung-woo's "Seoshi."

690
00:36:42,213 --> 00:36:44,680
I tried to leave before the sun fell.

691
00:36:52,875 --> 00:36:55,227
You guys ruined the mood!

692
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:58,814
Let's take a look! Maybe it's a song in return.

693
00:37:04,524 --> 00:37:06,257
Please turn the volume up!

694
00:37:06,477 --> 00:37:08,594
Is it okay...

695
00:37:10,477 --> 00:37:11,711
Come on...

696
00:37:11,821 --> 00:37:14,375
Is it okay...

697
00:37:15,915 --> 00:37:16,915
Come on...

698
00:37:17,383 --> 00:37:19,445
- I told you not to laugh.
- I didn't!

699
00:37:19,493 --> 00:37:21,893
- Don't laugh.
- It's just my face.

700
00:37:24,696 --> 00:37:27,562
I want you to listen to it carefully, okay?

701
00:37:29,297 --> 00:37:31,383
Is it okay...

702
00:37:33,227 --> 00:37:36,102
Even though I'm like this...

703
00:37:37,188 --> 00:37:39,588
Even though my love is like this...

704
00:37:40,313 --> 00:37:43,477
Can I still approach you?

705
00:37:45,171 --> 00:37:48,179
You know...

706
00:37:48,836 --> 00:37:51,585
That my heart...

707
00:37:52,773 --> 00:37:55,679
Is growing more and more...

708
00:37:55,828 --> 00:37:59,179
Do you feel it too?

709
00:38:01,258 --> 00:38:08,999
The times that I longed to spend with you...

710
00:38:09,898 --> 00:38:18,882
As they pass, I like you more and more...

711
00:38:20,015 --> 00:38:23,156
Can you see...

712
00:38:23,711 --> 00:38:29,538
My love?

713
00:38:31,008 --> 00:38:40,054
I didn't know it would grow this big...

714
00:38:40,922 --> 00:38:42,890
Yes, I...

715
00:38:44,391 --> 00:38:46,391
You're the one...

716
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:50,038
I love...

717
00:39:00,499 --> 00:39:02,335
Seok-hee is blushing!

718
00:39:03,265 --> 00:39:05,163
I think she's going to cry!

719
00:39:07,515 --> 00:39:09,913
- Let's release this single!
- That was awesome.

720
00:39:09,938 --> 00:39:12,338
We just need to fix it a tiny bit.

721
00:39:12,586 --> 00:39:14,351
Seo-beom is really happy right now too.

722
00:39:14,398 --> 00:39:16,609
Yeah, he teared up.

723
00:39:16,686 --> 00:39:18,632
Everyone here is happy.

724
00:39:19,258 --> 00:39:20,991
Yo-Han makes people happy.

725
00:39:21,367 --> 00:39:25,078
I'm not expecting much.
Just tell me how you felt.

726
00:39:26,890 --> 00:39:28,406
The overall feeling?

727
00:39:34,914 --> 00:39:38,328
If I look at the overall picture,

728
00:39:39,203 --> 00:39:40,601
- it's good.
- It's good?

729
00:39:40,726 --> 00:39:41,926
- Really?
- Yeah.

730
00:39:42,914 --> 00:39:45,359
She's beaming with happiness.

731
00:39:46,836 --> 00:39:48,367
- Are you sure?
- Yes!

732
00:39:49,492 --> 00:39:50,492
It was good.

733
00:39:52,569 --> 00:39:54,103
Why aren't you looking?

734
00:39:54,539 --> 00:39:56,265
You have a short thumb.

735
00:39:56,508 --> 00:39:57,908
I have a short thumb.

736
00:39:59,780 --> 00:40:01,114
That was surprising.

737
00:40:01,765 --> 00:40:03,966
I'm glad you thought it was good.

738
00:40:05,898 --> 00:40:08,781
I'll let you listen to it once I finish it.

739
00:40:11,531 --> 00:40:12,731
What do you think?

740
00:40:12,781 --> 00:40:15,114
We might not know much about music.

741
00:40:15,211 --> 00:40:18,778
He expressed his feelings
for the first time

742
00:40:18,803 --> 00:40:22,766
through his lyrics and ended
it with "I love you."

743
00:40:23,476 --> 00:40:26,010
Why do I feel like he said that to me?

744
00:40:26,266 --> 00:40:27,773
He doesn't sound like an amateur.

745
00:40:27,828 --> 00:40:31,460
I've never seen Seok-hee make that expression before.

746
00:40:31,508 --> 00:40:32,508
Seriously.

747
00:40:32,687 --> 00:40:36,937
She turned red and didn't know what to do with herself.

748
00:40:37,148 --> 00:40:39,082
I don't know much about music

749
00:40:39,445 --> 00:40:44,460
but I could tell how much Yo-Han cares for Seok-hee.

750
00:40:46,945 --> 00:40:48,412
Everything looks good.

751
00:40:48,695 --> 00:40:50,229
Should we get hairtail?

752
00:40:50,883 --> 00:40:52,683
Let's get one of these two.

753
00:40:53,726 --> 00:40:54,890
Grilled or stew?

754
00:40:55,023 --> 00:40:56,343
- Stew.
- Stew?

755
00:40:56,695 --> 00:40:58,162
Are you hungry or not?

756
00:40:58,187 --> 00:40:59,587
Of course I'm hungry!

757
00:40:59,633 --> 00:41:00,966
She's always hungry.

758
00:41:01,820 --> 00:41:03,585
That shouldn't be a question.

759
00:41:03,610 --> 00:41:05,538
A small should be enough for two, right?

760
00:41:05,563 --> 00:41:07,023
He just messed up.

761
00:41:07,508 --> 00:41:08,508
Medium?

762
00:41:08,975 --> 00:41:09,975
Medium.

763
00:41:11,719 --> 00:41:15,461
Excuse me, could we get medium sized seafood hairtail stew?

764
00:41:15,508 --> 00:41:17,906
- Jejudo is all about...
- You have to get it.

765
00:41:17,922 --> 00:41:19,859
- You have to get hairtail.
- I'm hungry.

766
00:41:20,234 --> 00:41:21,726
Yo-Han is sensitive.

767
00:41:22,484 --> 00:41:23,684
It's an open view.

768
00:41:28,078 --> 00:41:29,878
The ocean is really pretty.

769
00:41:31,648 --> 00:41:33,124
The ocean is really pretty.

770
00:41:35,953 --> 00:41:37,749
- She didn't yawn, right?
- She did.

771
00:41:37,774 --> 00:41:39,441
- She yawned.
- She did?

772
00:41:41,624 --> 00:41:43,203
That's a lot.

773
00:41:45,992 --> 00:41:47,117
What is that?

774
00:41:49,094 --> 00:41:50,195
It's moving.

775
00:41:51,008 --> 00:41:53,093
Everything in that rectangle is food?

776
00:41:53,118 --> 00:41:56,118
- It has everything.
- It looks really good.

777
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:59,507
I only saw stuff like that on social media.

778
00:41:59,711 --> 00:42:03,304
Even if I want that for dinner,
I'd have to go to Jejudo.

779
00:42:03,351 --> 00:42:05,285
It's screaming, "I'm Jejudo!"

780
00:42:07,695 --> 00:42:09,046
We should cut it.

781
00:42:10,288 --> 00:42:11,453
It's splashing.

782
00:42:15,922 --> 00:42:18,585
- My hand is going to cramp.
- Already?

783
00:42:19,022 --> 00:42:21,030
Why does he always get cramps?

784
00:42:21,383 --> 00:42:23,898
Yo-Han always cramps up after doing little things.

785
00:42:23,923 --> 00:42:27,695
When he was singing, I was worried he
would cramp up from playing the piano.

786
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:28,976
The vibe was going well.

787
00:42:29,039 --> 00:42:31,999
This requires utmost focus.

788
00:42:32,812 --> 00:42:36,345
You get the most cramps out of all the people I know.

789
00:42:37,328 --> 00:42:39,601
That looks really good!

790
00:42:40,086 --> 00:42:41,219
Should we eat it?

791
00:42:43,945 --> 00:42:46,367
That looks so good.
It's the best!

792
00:42:46,392 --> 00:42:48,937
I just imagined what the sauce would taste like.

793
00:42:48,962 --> 00:42:51,695
- With the ocean view...
- It's so good.

794
00:43:00,930 --> 00:43:03,585
Did Yo-Han just pick up a spoon?

795
00:43:03,758 --> 00:43:05,273
Isn't that his first time?

796
00:43:05,298 --> 00:43:07,101
I've never seen him use a spoon before.

797
00:43:07,140 --> 00:43:08,757
It must be that good.

798
00:43:10,336 --> 00:43:12,804
- Don't drop it.
- I won't.

799
00:43:14,037 --> 00:43:15,171
That looks good.

800
00:43:15,523 --> 00:43:17,790
How come I can't get it like that?

801
00:43:18,430 --> 00:43:20,563
It's better to eat it like this.

802
00:43:21,367 --> 00:43:24,367
- It's really good.
- It must be super good.

803
00:43:29,281 --> 00:43:33,187
It must be amazing. Seok-hee is eating with both of her hands.

804
00:43:33,429 --> 00:43:36,765
- It can't not be good.
- For real. It's so good.

805
00:43:52,226 --> 00:43:53,375
It's really good.

806
00:44:02,781 --> 00:44:03,781
Cart racing?

807
00:44:07,656 --> 00:44:09,389
I want to go visit Jejudo.

808
00:44:11,781 --> 00:44:12,781
It's huge.

809
00:44:14,351 --> 00:44:15,351
This is it.

810
00:44:16,023 --> 00:44:17,523
I've never been on one before.

811
00:44:17,555 --> 00:44:20,617
Yo-Han tried everything for the first time with Seok-hee.

812
00:44:20,642 --> 00:44:22,898
- It will be the most memorable.
- Yeah.

813
00:44:22,968 --> 00:44:25,898
The lady can sit there.
And you can sit here.

814
00:44:25,945 --> 00:44:27,242
- 31?
- Yes.

815
00:44:31,281 --> 00:44:32,289
Good.

816
00:44:35,383 --> 00:44:38,929
Look at how Yo-Han folds his legs because they're so long.

817
00:44:39,055 --> 00:44:40,121
Wow, Seok-hee...

818
00:44:41,218 --> 00:44:43,309
What if Yo-Han cramps up again?

819
00:44:45,461 --> 00:44:47,062
It's already going fast!

820
00:44:50,766 --> 00:44:52,593
My goodness...

821
00:44:52,906 --> 00:44:56,507
It's because he doesn't have a license.
He doesn't have a sense of driving.

822
00:44:56,594 --> 00:44:58,727
He said it's already going fast.

823
00:45:00,297 --> 00:45:02,507
Seok-hee looks relaxed.

824
00:45:15,203 --> 00:45:16,976
Seok-hee is even drifting.

825
00:45:17,039 --> 00:45:19,484
Seok-hee is the best driver.

826
00:45:22,344 --> 00:45:25,677
All helmets look like they were made for Seok-hee.

827
00:45:27,969 --> 00:45:29,663
He's going slow because he's scared.

828
00:45:29,688 --> 00:45:31,976
- He has a lot of fears.
- Yes, he does.

829
00:45:31,984 --> 00:45:33,651
I don't think this is it.

830
00:45:41,062 --> 00:45:42,662
What happened to Yo-Han?

831
00:45:43,984 --> 00:45:45,663
Did he step on the wrong pedal?

832
00:45:45,695 --> 00:45:47,023
Please help me!

833
00:45:50,469 --> 00:45:51,796
Please help me!

834
00:45:58,703 --> 00:45:59,913
This is...

835
00:46:00,374 --> 00:46:02,609
Yo-Han needs a lot of help.

836
00:46:03,656 --> 00:46:06,589
Yo-Han shouldn't be taking care of Seok-hee.

837
00:46:10,601 --> 00:46:12,201
Seok-hee is really good!

838
00:46:13,203 --> 00:46:14,536
How are you so good?

839
00:46:15,781 --> 00:46:16,781
Stop.

840
00:46:17,601 --> 00:46:20,268
- You guys are going to race.
- Really?

841
00:46:20,555 --> 00:46:22,688
Will he even be a match for her?

842
00:46:22,922 --> 00:46:25,322
- Let's just bet on drinks.
- Okay.

843
00:46:25,347 --> 00:46:27,031
It's like a rabbit racing with a turtle.

844
00:46:27,056 --> 00:46:28,773
I don't think he'll be a match.

845
00:46:28,798 --> 00:46:31,578
Yo-Han may show his true self.

846
00:46:31,726 --> 00:46:36,046
I'm more interested in when he'll cramp up.

847
00:46:40,062 --> 00:46:42,062
Seok-hee is going easy on him.

848
00:46:44,484 --> 00:46:46,195
- Shouldn't it be reversed?
- Yeah.

849
00:46:46,220 --> 00:46:47,751
That's even sadder.

850
00:46:47,773 --> 00:46:49,240
She gave him handicap.

851
00:46:49,633 --> 00:46:52,492
Why are you so fast?

852
00:46:53,413 --> 00:46:54,632
She's lying.

853
00:46:54,898 --> 00:46:56,945
You're going too fast!

854
00:46:59,257 --> 00:47:00,640
Yo-Han slow down!

855
00:47:00,665 --> 00:47:01,665
How cute.

856
00:47:03,359 --> 00:47:04,734
Yo-Han slow down!

857
00:47:06,336 --> 00:47:07,469
Yo-Han slow down!

858
00:47:08,554 --> 00:47:09,804
What the...

859
00:47:11,375 --> 00:47:12,578
Yo-Han, you--

860
00:47:16,843 --> 00:47:19,376
I can't let you win even if I want to.

861
00:47:20,539 --> 00:47:23,781
- The staff is there again.
- He needs a lot of help.

862
00:47:26,140 --> 00:47:28,492
He turned the handle too much because he was scared.

863
00:47:28,570 --> 00:47:31,132
I've given up.

864
00:47:38,609 --> 00:47:40,676
I don't think driving suits me.

865
00:47:41,468 --> 00:47:43,374
- He's just too scared, right?
- Yes.

866
00:47:43,399 --> 00:47:44,804
He's not experienced in driving.

867
00:47:44,844 --> 00:47:47,906
I made Seok-hee get class 1 license.

868
00:47:47,931 --> 00:47:49,968
- She knows how to drive a stick.
- She's good.

869
00:47:50,016 --> 00:47:53,234
And I was the one who taught her,
so she's very good.

870
00:47:56,101 --> 00:47:57,499
It's raining again.

871
00:47:58,031 --> 00:48:01,187
- It's because it's raining in my heart.
- Why is it raining in your heart?

872
00:48:01,219 --> 00:48:02,351
It keeps on raining.

873
00:48:02,375 --> 00:48:04,320
They look like they're golfing.

874
00:48:05,085 --> 00:48:07,132
- Oh that thing!
- Don't you go inside it?

875
00:48:07,141 --> 00:48:08,843
It floats on water too.

876
00:48:09,211 --> 00:48:10,344
It's very bouncy.

877
00:48:20,180 --> 00:48:22,406
Oh you face each other!

878
00:48:22,431 --> 00:48:25,210
- It's the longest course in Asia.
- Let's play a game.

879
00:48:25,531 --> 00:48:28,304
Choose one that you can do.

880
00:48:29,046 --> 00:48:30,593
This thing spins.

881
00:48:30,812 --> 00:48:34,953
We'll pick an artist and take turns singing their songs.

882
00:48:35,141 --> 00:48:37,015
Who's going to pick the artist?

883
00:48:37,101 --> 00:48:38,101
You pick.

884
00:48:39,476 --> 00:48:40,476
Hong Seo-beom.

885
00:48:40,578 --> 00:48:42,226
That's harsh. I only know 2 songs.

886
00:48:42,251 --> 00:48:45,031
Why is it harsh? My dad is watching.
You're harsh.

887
00:48:45,056 --> 00:48:46,578
I only know 2 songs.

888
00:48:46,603 --> 00:48:47,603
Which two?

889
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:49,015
"Rip Kim" and "It's a Fireball."

890
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:51,226
Which one are you going to sing first?

891
00:48:53,414 --> 00:48:54,515
Isn't it like that?

892
00:48:54,531 --> 00:48:57,265
You've go to sing it at least past 3 seconds.

893
00:48:57,290 --> 00:48:59,648
I only listened to the highlight because I like it so much.

894
00:48:59,687 --> 00:49:00,687
Your turn.

895
00:49:07,422 --> 00:49:10,273
Her dad is loving it!

896
00:49:10,687 --> 00:49:12,804
Look at how happy he is.

897
00:49:12,867 --> 00:49:13,867
How cute.

898
00:49:14,218 --> 00:49:16,151
I told you I don't know them.

899
00:49:16,172 --> 00:49:19,343
Why don't you know my dad's songs?
He sings really well.

900
00:49:19,406 --> 00:49:21,859
I know he does but...

901
00:49:22,007 --> 00:49:25,749
- She's showing off about her dad.
- There's "The Prayer Of The Poor Lovers."

902
00:49:25,797 --> 00:49:26,930
I've heard of it.

903
00:49:27,076 --> 00:49:29,515
It was the number one song for over 10 weeks.

904
00:49:29,540 --> 00:49:32,890
I'm not 100% sure since my dad is the one who told me.

905
00:49:32,937 --> 00:49:34,999
He tells you those kind of things?

906
00:49:35,062 --> 00:49:37,596
It was called the "Streetboard Chart."

907
00:49:37,797 --> 00:49:39,913
- Out on the streets.
- Yes.

908
00:49:40,109 --> 00:49:42,281
It was the number one song for 16 weeks.

909
00:49:42,319 --> 00:49:43,687
That's amazing.

910
00:49:46,390 --> 00:49:48,413
How does it go?
Sing it for me.

911
00:49:50,273 --> 00:49:53,093
- Make the sunset fall asleep...
- That was it.

912
00:49:53,578 --> 00:49:56,445
- That's what it was.
- I think I know it.

913
00:49:57,367 --> 00:50:03,078
And build a bridge with the golden spirit...

914
00:50:03,515 --> 00:50:04,984
You're good.

915
00:50:05,570 --> 00:50:08,476
Can you sing the original since it's our last episode?

916
00:50:08,516 --> 00:50:10,116
- Yeah!
- On the piano.

917
00:50:14,030 --> 00:50:16,148
Yo-Han, are you seeing this?

918
00:50:16,961 --> 00:50:18,227
Let's listen to it.

919
00:51:06,218 --> 00:51:07,632
That was awesome.

920
00:51:07,812 --> 00:51:09,412
That was really awesome.

921
00:51:09,843 --> 00:51:11,218
So awesome.

922
00:51:14,820 --> 00:51:20,484
I think you singing it now sounds even
more awesome than it did back then.

923
00:51:23,039 --> 00:51:24,906
Which artist should we pick?

924
00:51:25,820 --> 00:51:27,703
Should we pick IU since you like her?

925
00:51:27,728 --> 00:51:28,728
Okay.

926
00:51:28,835 --> 00:51:30,769
I'm good with IU's songs too.

927
00:51:30,794 --> 00:51:33,124
What are we betting on?

928
00:51:33,913 --> 00:51:36,122
- We're in Jejudo, right?
- Yes.

929
00:51:36,147 --> 00:51:37,960
What is it filled with?

930
00:51:39,007 --> 00:51:41,328
There are a lot of mountains here.

931
00:51:41,359 --> 00:51:43,124
You said the ocean was pretty.

932
00:51:43,203 --> 00:51:45,736
I'll give you a chance to go in there.

933
00:51:45,761 --> 00:51:48,179
Why do you think I'm going to go in?
Won't it be too cold for you?

934
00:51:48,203 --> 00:51:49,736
The loser has to go in?

935
00:51:49,761 --> 00:51:52,109
He said, "You're going to catch a cold."

936
00:51:52,134 --> 00:51:54,001
When he's the one who's going in.

937
00:51:59,156 --> 00:52:00,156
Go inside.

938
00:52:02,359 --> 00:52:05,484
He's entering it weirdly too.

939
00:52:05,773 --> 00:52:08,374
- He could just crawl in.
- It's very comfortable.

940
00:52:15,202 --> 00:52:16,202
Hold on...

941
00:52:16,344 --> 00:52:17,921
They're going in it together?

942
00:52:17,946 --> 00:52:20,171
They face each other and roll.

943
00:52:21,140 --> 00:52:22,312
One, two, three!

944
00:52:22,337 --> 00:52:24,109
You can't lift me!

945
00:52:24,242 --> 00:52:25,593
I'll do it.

946
00:52:26,296 --> 00:52:28,363
I'm stuck because of your foot!

947
00:52:29,241 --> 00:52:33,945
- You stepped on me!
- Seok-hee is stepping on Yo-han's foot!

948
00:52:34,656 --> 00:52:37,601
He sounded like he got ran over by a car.

949
00:52:37,703 --> 00:52:39,031
Look at Yo-Han.

950
00:52:42,054 --> 00:52:43,437
This is so funny.

951
00:52:44,797 --> 00:52:46,937
It's like a sitcom.

952
00:52:47,500 --> 00:52:48,500
I'll go first.

953
00:52:50,094 --> 00:52:51,094
Should I start?

954
00:52:51,156 --> 00:52:52,689
No, we need to go down.

955
00:52:53,484 --> 00:52:55,151
Is this going to be open?

956
00:52:55,641 --> 00:52:58,499
How long does it take to get down?

957
00:52:58,524 --> 00:52:59,578
Less than 5 minutes.

958
00:52:59,594 --> 00:53:01,460
That's a really long course!

959
00:53:02,726 --> 00:53:03,867
They're going!

960
00:53:04,311 --> 00:53:06,253
It's already making me dizzy!

961
00:53:11,296 --> 00:53:13,101
What? I couldn't hear you!

962
00:53:13,234 --> 00:53:15,601
This doesn't stop.

963
00:53:20,281 --> 00:53:22,531
My feet are slipping out!

964
00:53:22,594 --> 00:53:23,882
She looks like a piece of paper.

965
00:53:23,906 --> 00:53:25,306
Her feet slipped out.

966
00:53:41,883 --> 00:53:44,718
They must have healthy cochlea because they're young.

967
00:53:44,812 --> 00:53:46,109
I'd throw up.

968
00:53:46,781 --> 00:53:49,187
They still sang during it.

969
00:53:49,212 --> 00:53:50,612
It smells like grass.

970
00:53:56,694 --> 00:53:58,006
This is scary.

971
00:53:59,289 --> 00:54:01,132
This is thrilling. It's fun.

972
00:54:05,031 --> 00:54:06,831
Hold on, I think I'm stuck.

973
00:54:07,851 --> 00:54:09,459
Where did she get stuck?

974
00:54:12,242 --> 00:54:13,242
Of course.

975
00:54:16,164 --> 00:54:19,187
Seok-hee and Yo-Han always make us laugh with their moves.

976
00:54:19,212 --> 00:54:20,695
Hold on. You get up first.

977
00:54:20,766 --> 00:54:22,099
You're squishing me.

978
00:54:23,242 --> 00:54:24,851
You get up first.

979
00:54:29,999 --> 00:54:31,000
He's squished.

980
00:54:33,420 --> 00:54:35,015
Why is this so funny?

981
00:54:38,749 --> 00:54:40,937
What is that? "The Ring?"

982
00:54:41,765 --> 00:54:43,062
He's the ghost.

983
00:54:47,641 --> 00:54:50,312
You're always hurt after everything.

984
00:54:52,031 --> 00:54:54,187
- I won.
- Can you take this off?

985
00:54:54,281 --> 00:54:57,148
Everything Seok-hee does requires a helmet.

986
00:55:04,633 --> 00:55:06,734
She looks like Jeon In-Kwon.

987
00:55:12,078 --> 00:55:13,218
It was fun.

988
00:55:14,742 --> 00:55:16,942
- Who do you think won?
- I did.

989
00:55:18,156 --> 00:55:20,179
I won! Replay the clip!

990
00:55:21,687 --> 00:55:22,754
Replay the clip.

991
00:55:26,288 --> 00:55:28,257
Let's just both go in.

992
00:55:29,936 --> 00:55:30,944
Should we?

993
00:55:31,451 --> 00:55:34,007
Seok-hee is charismatic and proactive.

994
00:55:34,094 --> 00:55:36,640
I said I'd go in there with you
although you're the one who lost.

995
00:55:36,696 --> 00:55:37,781
I didn't lose.

996
00:55:37,937 --> 00:55:40,382
- Let's say I lost. I'll go in.
- Okay.

997
00:55:40,484 --> 00:55:41,884
Then I'll just watch.

998
00:55:44,476 --> 00:55:46,609
Yo-Han fell for it.

999
00:55:47,163 --> 00:55:49,406
- You're really smart.
- I know, right?

1000
00:55:50,038 --> 00:55:51,374
I hear that a lot.

1001
00:55:51,399 --> 00:55:52,799
Let's go in together.

1002
00:55:53,398 --> 00:55:55,023
Why are you whining?

1003
00:55:55,500 --> 00:55:57,187
Why are you whining?

1004
00:55:57,562 --> 00:55:59,406
He's going into the ocean?

1005
00:55:59,431 --> 00:56:00,749
Is he really going to go in?

1006
00:56:00,774 --> 00:56:02,843
Soo-geun, you're an expert on going into the ocean.

1007
00:56:02,868 --> 00:56:07,101
What do you think about Yo-Han going into the ocean?

1008
00:56:07,180 --> 00:56:10,296
It's easy to go in, but Yo-Han doesn't have fat on his body.

1009
00:56:10,453 --> 00:56:13,093
It will get absorbed straight to his bones.

1010
00:56:13,118 --> 00:56:14,640
So he'll feel the cold fast.

1011
00:56:14,665 --> 00:56:15,998
And the chilly wind.

1012
00:56:16,141 --> 00:56:19,015
It's an issue when they come out of the water.

1013
00:56:19,116 --> 00:56:21,976
And he might cramp up if it's too cold.

1014
00:56:29,008 --> 00:56:31,921
- Is he really going in?
- No way.

1015
00:56:31,946 --> 00:56:33,874
You can't go in at a place like that.

1016
00:56:33,899 --> 00:56:36,359
- The winter wind...
- Of course not.

1017
00:56:36,384 --> 00:56:37,796
The wind is cold but...

1018
00:56:38,859 --> 00:56:40,953
He should've dressed more warmly.

1019
00:56:41,328 --> 00:56:45,562
Seok-hee, give me your hand.

1020
00:56:47,968 --> 00:56:49,023
Hold it right.

1021
00:56:49,117 --> 00:56:52,374
She doesn't cover her hand with her sleeves anymore.

1022
00:56:52,391 --> 00:56:55,140
You're right. She's not covering it anymore.

1023
00:56:55,507 --> 00:56:57,046
They're cute.

1024
00:56:57,140 --> 00:56:59,460
They look like they're on their honeymoon.

1025
00:56:59,531 --> 00:57:02,398
I want them to be together for a long time.

1026
00:57:05,640 --> 00:57:07,546
Let's sit here for a while.

1027
00:57:19,734 --> 00:57:21,984
Two days have gone by already.

1028
00:57:22,906 --> 00:57:24,124
Time flies by so fast.

1029
00:57:24,149 --> 00:57:26,187
- They were there for 2 days?
- Yes.

1030
00:57:26,319 --> 00:57:28,265
Oh yeah, they slept over.

1031
00:57:28,328 --> 00:57:29,328
How was it?

1032
00:57:30,187 --> 00:57:31,640
I'm tired but...

1033
00:57:32,750 --> 00:57:33,750
it was fun.

1034
00:57:34,125 --> 00:57:36,703
You said it's your first time here.

1035
00:57:36,859 --> 00:57:37,867
How was it?

1036
00:57:37,992 --> 00:57:40,445
I really didn't know it would be like this.

1037
00:57:40,516 --> 00:57:41,516
Like what?

1038
00:57:41,851 --> 00:57:45,913
Since it's part of our country,
I thought it would be nothing special.

1039
00:57:46,109 --> 00:57:48,445
Now I get why people come here.

1040
00:57:51,155 --> 00:57:53,171
- What's wrong?
- Where is she going?

1041
00:57:53,226 --> 00:57:54,226
What is it?

1042
00:57:58,031 --> 00:57:59,031
Seok-hee did?

1043
00:57:59,078 --> 00:58:00,411
- A gift.
- Really?

1044
00:58:01,015 --> 00:58:02,757
- Is it a blanket?
- No.

1045
00:58:03,547 --> 00:58:05,265
- It's a gift.
- What?

1046
00:58:08,719 --> 00:58:10,882
Seok-hee got Yo-Han a gift?

1047
00:58:10,907 --> 00:58:12,374
- Really?
- What is it?

1048
00:58:12,539 --> 00:58:13,872
I guess it's a gift.

1049
00:58:14,008 --> 00:58:15,546
- Is it a dolphin?
- Yeah.

1050
00:58:17,711 --> 00:58:20,929
It was at the dolphin place.

1051
00:58:21,015 --> 00:58:24,054
- Dalkong and....
- Nakwon?

1052
00:58:24,234 --> 00:58:25,937
Yes, Nakwon.

1053
00:58:27,192 --> 00:58:31,468
(They experienced dolphin training session the day before)

1054
00:58:32,148 --> 00:58:36,413
(She got the stuffed animal from there for Yo-Han)

1055
00:58:37,038 --> 00:58:39,859
When did you get it? You had the time to do it?

1056
00:58:39,898 --> 00:58:42,585
Yesterday. I changed earlier than you.

1057
00:58:45,179 --> 00:58:47,398
So that's when you got it.
Thank you.

1058
00:58:48,490 --> 00:58:51,264
- I think it was a surprise gift.
- Yeah.

1059
00:58:51,414 --> 00:58:52,671
I'm touched.

1060
00:58:53,351 --> 00:58:55,140
- Isn't it cute?
- I love this...

1061
00:58:55,624 --> 00:58:56,851
Yeah, it's cute.

1062
00:59:06,757 --> 00:59:08,804
Why is my heart beating fast?

1063
00:59:09,085 --> 00:59:11,242
It's so good how it turned out.

1064
00:59:11,344 --> 00:59:13,210
I really like them together.

1065
00:59:16,656 --> 00:59:18,710
Why did you make the clip look like it's the last?

1066
00:59:18,750 --> 00:59:21,217
That's when they did the temple stay.

1067
00:59:25,984 --> 00:59:27,584
What? She's hugging him?

1068
00:59:29,842 --> 00:59:31,233
Oh, a hug?

1069
00:59:35,804 --> 00:59:37,023
How cute!

1070
00:59:40,391 --> 00:59:42,507
Yo-Han looks so happy.

1071
00:59:51,233 --> 00:59:53,648
Seok-hee looks happy.

1072
00:59:55,289 --> 00:59:56,289
Let's go.

1073
01:00:05,163 --> 01:00:08,273
- He must be feeling mixed emotions.
- He's about to cry.

1074
01:00:08,298 --> 01:00:10,742
- This will make you cry.
- Seok-hee is all grown up.

1075
01:00:10,767 --> 01:00:12,734
- I'm crying too.
- Me too.

1076
01:00:13,194 --> 01:00:16,445
- What's going on?
- I'm about to cry because he's crying.

1077
01:00:16,586 --> 01:00:18,523
I like that they're tears of joy.

1078
01:00:18,609 --> 01:00:20,577
- Seok-hee is all grown up.
- Yes.

1079
01:00:22,015 --> 01:00:23,655
- I'm crying.
- We didn't expect this.

1080
01:00:23,734 --> 01:00:31,242
I know Seok-hee is his daughter,
but we also saw her grow up.

1081
01:00:31,666 --> 01:00:33,557
What are you feeling?

1082
01:00:35,166 --> 01:00:36,408
I'm happy.

1083
01:00:36,823 --> 01:00:38,596
We're very happy too.

1084
01:00:38,682 --> 01:00:42,611
It was a precious clip that warmed up our hearts.

1085
01:00:42,862 --> 01:00:47,705
You saying "I'm happy" makes us even happier.

1086
01:00:51,267 --> 01:00:56,103
Why don't you send a video message to
Seok-hee and Yo-Han for the first time?

1087
01:00:57,002 --> 01:00:59,080
For the first time ever!

1088
01:00:59,174 --> 01:01:00,900
Then just send one to Yo-Han.

1089
01:01:00,971 --> 01:01:04,291
Thank you Yo-Han for treating Seok-hee well

1090
01:01:04,409 --> 01:01:09,752
and for accepting her even when she's rude.

1091
01:01:12,190 --> 01:01:13,799
Your song was good.

1092
01:01:14,924 --> 01:01:16,596
He's so lovely.

1093
01:01:17,619 --> 01:01:25,674
Thank you, and I hope you guys continue
your relationship loving each other.

1094
01:01:25,737 --> 01:01:26,737
Thank you.

1095
01:01:29,299 --> 01:01:30,963
Shall we wrap it up--

1096
01:01:32,495 --> 01:01:33,767
What is that?

1097
01:01:34,237 --> 01:01:36,080
Shall we wrap it up--

1098
01:01:37,556 --> 01:01:39,697
- What is that?
- "Thought it was over?"

1099
01:01:41,955 --> 01:01:43,627
They went for 3 days?

1100
01:01:44,517 --> 01:01:46,064
He got angry right away.

1101
01:01:46,135 --> 01:01:48,666
Hold on! You should've told us!

1102
01:01:48,691 --> 01:01:51,502
He must be keeping his promise to go into the ocean!

1103
01:01:51,580 --> 01:01:53,182
Let's go in together.

1104
01:01:53,721 --> 01:01:55,537
Just take off your clothes.

1105
01:02:00,525 --> 01:02:01,752
Oh my goodness!

1106
01:02:01,776 --> 01:02:03,049
It's too cold.

1107
01:02:03,721 --> 01:02:05,174
He really went in?

1108
01:02:06,268 --> 01:02:07,868
Touch it with your hand.

1109
01:02:12,409 --> 01:02:13,409
Oh no!

1110
01:02:14,330 --> 01:02:16,863
It sounds like seagulls are flying by.

1111
01:02:20,790 --> 01:02:22,799
- She sounds like a dolphin.
- What are you going to do?

1112
01:02:22,824 --> 01:02:24,924
I didn't know it would go all the way up here.

1113
01:02:24,949 --> 01:02:26,616
How is he going to go in?

1114
01:02:28,619 --> 01:02:30,353
I'm really going to do it.

1115
01:02:30,518 --> 01:02:32,580
Just run to it!

1116
01:02:41,696 --> 01:02:45,033
He fell down!

1117
01:02:45,932 --> 01:02:48,767
He tried to be cool but he fell down!

1118
01:03:13,666 --> 01:03:16,494
- Yo-Han! Another one is coming!
- No!

1119
01:03:17,127 --> 01:03:18,549
Until the very end!

1120
01:03:19,143 --> 01:03:20,752
That was the best sitcom.

1121
01:03:20,862 --> 01:03:22,541
This is really a sitcom.

1122
01:03:22,580 --> 01:03:23,830
This is so funny.

1123
01:03:25,502 --> 01:03:28,443
Swim a little bit since you went in already.

1124
01:03:47,674 --> 01:03:49,072
Thank you guys!

1125
01:03:49,112 --> 01:03:50,846
That was so nice.

1126
01:03:51,159 --> 01:03:54,510
Anyway, it feels like we watched a drama of their growth.

1127
01:03:54,565 --> 01:03:55,565
Yes.

1128
01:03:55,590 --> 01:03:58,338
I wish the best for you guys.
We're rooting for you.

1129
01:03:58,363 --> 01:03:59,510
We're rooting for you!

1130
01:03:59,535 --> 01:04:01,330
- You guys are so cute.
- Be happy!

1131
01:04:01,377 --> 01:04:05,705
I hope they continue to cherish each other always.

1132
01:04:05,730 --> 01:04:08,221
We prepared special gifts for the dads.

1133
01:04:08,291 --> 01:04:09,994
A surprise gift.

1134
01:04:10,221 --> 01:04:15,288
We gathered the daughters' honest thoughts
and put them in a video message.

1135
01:04:16,784 --> 01:04:19,150
- Let's take a look.
- Let's look at it together.

1136
01:04:19,190 --> 01:04:23,408
I'm very thankful that you went on your
first entertainment show for your daughter.

1137
01:04:23,447 --> 01:04:28,346
I feel Ike we made a lot of memories by being on this show together.

1138
01:04:28,729 --> 01:04:33,767
And how chill you were when it came to my dating life...

1139
01:04:34,204 --> 01:04:37,135
Saying "It doesn't matter"
or "I can't help it" made

1140
01:04:37,160 --> 01:04:39,979
me feel like you trust me
so it made me very happy.

1141
01:04:40,190 --> 01:04:43,924
Don't look for mom all the time,
and look for me too.

1142
01:04:45,159 --> 01:04:49,158
Lastly, you know you're my ideal type forever, right/

1143
01:04:49,283 --> 01:04:50,517
I love you dad!

1144
01:04:52,564 --> 01:04:53,744
How cute.

1145
01:04:54,862 --> 01:04:57,128
You said I only look for your mom.

1146
01:04:58,307 --> 01:05:03,744
But you guys are going to live longer than your mom.

1147
01:05:04,940 --> 01:05:13,752
Don't worry about that. I love your
mom, your sister and you all the same.

1148
01:05:14,212 --> 01:05:20,102
I'm very happy because this was a good experience.

1149
01:05:23,126 --> 01:05:27,711
When I saw you crying when I was in Mokpo,

1150
01:05:28,298 --> 01:05:30,875
I cried a lot on my own too.

1151
01:05:31,782 --> 01:05:34,477
You drank a lot and came home and said

1152
01:05:34,766 --> 01:05:38,015
that you were really sorry
for making me stay home

1153
01:05:38,040 --> 01:05:41,352
and not letting me build
memories when I was little.

1154
01:05:41,454 --> 01:05:45,000
When you said that and hugged me...

1155
01:05:45,610 --> 01:05:52,524
To be honest, it was hard for me to understand
you and I didn't like you before that.

1156
01:05:52,954 --> 01:05:56,032
But that moment made up for everything.

1157
01:05:56,227 --> 01:06:00,297
I think that we've gotten closer through this.

1158
01:06:00,845 --> 01:06:08,024
And I'll be more bright and cute towards you
like how I am on dates.

1159
01:06:08,899 --> 01:06:12,532
I learned that I should approach you more.

1160
01:06:14,524 --> 01:06:16,852
Dad, I love you.

1161
01:06:17,337 --> 01:06:18,516
I love you.

1162
01:06:24,211 --> 01:06:25,367
That was nice.

1163
01:06:26,688 --> 01:06:31,008
- The daughters are all...
- They're all thinking of their dads.

1164
01:06:32,759 --> 01:06:37,813
I'm sure all parents love their children the same way.

1165
01:06:37,923 --> 01:06:39,422
I'm not an exception.

1166
01:06:39,618 --> 01:06:44,592
That's why I made a lot
of suggestions so that

1167
01:06:44,617 --> 01:06:49,485
I can keep you safe and
well while growing up.

1168
01:06:49,563 --> 01:06:57,446
I'm very thankful that you realize I did it because I love you.

1169
01:06:57,688 --> 01:07:01,047
Soo-bin, thank you for being born.

1170
01:07:07,360 --> 01:07:10,930
Through filming for the past few months,

1171
01:07:11,883 --> 01:07:18,360
I think I've been gifted with new experiences and memories.

1172
01:07:20,532 --> 01:07:25,477
It was hard because I'm very shy.

1173
01:07:25,798 --> 01:07:30,078
But I think I've matured through the show.

1174
01:07:30,298 --> 01:07:35,969
I'll try to be a nicer and better daughter this new year.

1175
01:07:36,063 --> 01:07:42,407
And I'll do my best to make you happy.

1176
01:07:42,641 --> 01:07:45,086
Thank you for raising me.

1177
01:07:45,539 --> 01:07:47,157
I love you.

1178
01:07:54,829 --> 01:07:56,532
What I'd like from you is...

1179
01:07:56,563 --> 01:07:58,516
Life is a very hard thing.

1180
01:07:59,117 --> 01:08:01,875
Of course it won't be hard if you could do whatever you want.

1181
01:08:01,970 --> 01:08:09,688
But being respected and revered by others isn't easy.

1182
01:08:10,063 --> 01:08:15,344
I hope you'll always try your best and study hard.

1183
01:08:19,970 --> 01:08:21,266
Hi dad.

1184
01:08:24,337 --> 01:08:25,337
Hi.

1185
01:08:27,508 --> 01:08:31,883
I know I gained a lot through this show,

1186
01:08:32,384 --> 01:08:36,748
but I'm sure you know
about the stress that

1187
01:08:36,773 --> 01:08:41,235
I've gained as well even
if I don't tell you.

1188
01:08:41,384 --> 01:08:47,571
I'll try my best to not make you worry

1189
01:08:48,423 --> 01:08:49,956
so please wait and see.

1190
01:08:50,055 --> 01:08:58,297
Thank you so much for always supporting
me and believing in me.

1191
01:08:58,985 --> 01:09:01,188
Dad, I love you.

1192
01:09:07,454 --> 01:09:11,977
Seok-hee, I know it was hard for you to tell me that you love me

1193
01:09:12,048 --> 01:09:15,914
but I love you more than you could express it.

1194
01:09:16,048 --> 01:09:22,055
And congratulations on meeting a nice boyfriend through the show.

1195
01:09:22,235 --> 01:09:27,657
But I'd like you to ease up on eating a bit.

1196
01:09:28,649 --> 01:09:31,649
Please continue to be healthy like right now.

1197
01:09:32,485 --> 01:09:33,485
I love you.

1198
01:09:35,985 --> 01:09:42,313
We laughed and cried a lot on this season
thanks to the 4 dads and their daughters.

1199
01:09:42,430 --> 01:09:44,672
We were very happy.

1200
01:09:44,782 --> 01:09:48,563
We say this is the end,
but it's not over until it's really over.

1201
01:09:48,641 --> 01:09:50,375
That's all of our hope.

1202
01:09:50,516 --> 01:09:55,985
This is the end for us, but the
daughters will be on next week.

1203
01:09:56,438 --> 01:09:59,638
The behind the scenes stories from the daughters

1204
01:09:59,868 --> 01:10:02,610
and best scenes will all be shown.

1205
01:10:02,635 --> 01:10:04,158
Don't miss out!

1206
01:10:04,235 --> 01:10:06,797
Don't forget to tune in next week!

1207
01:10:07,079 --> 01:10:10,203
This is it for My Daughters' Men Season 4!

1208
01:10:10,320 --> 01:10:12,485
Good bye!

1209
01:10:12,510 --> 01:10:14,110
Thank you!

1210
01:10:15,126 --> 01:10:19,392
We're here with the 4 daughters
from My Daughters' Men Season 4.

1211
01:10:30,095 --> 01:10:32,032
I asked them to set me up too.

1212
01:10:32,057 --> 01:10:33,633
I called too.

1213
01:10:34,070 --> 01:10:36,125
I said I should've been on this season instead.

1214
01:10:36,157 --> 01:10:37,305
You really did.

1215
01:10:37,438 --> 01:10:38,969
There's a back story.

1216
01:10:41,368 --> 01:10:42,422
I hate that.

1217
01:10:42,829 --> 01:10:43,829
Wow.

1218
01:10:44,141 --> 01:10:45,391
It's really not.

1219
01:10:46,258 --> 01:10:47,925
I really liked it because...

1220
01:10:49,468 --> 01:10:51,258
Girls are supposed to...
