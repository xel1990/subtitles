00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:06,900
If it is a love at first sight, would you be a couple on that day or not?

2
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:12,460
To pick one from celebrity, maybe ‘Yoon Du Jun’ (Highlight)?

In the first time, I was not really serious.

6
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:37,460
[Hong Kwang Keun, 29 Years old, Businessman]
For this time, I would be more serious and show my real quality.

[Kim Min Jeon, 28 Years old, Businesswoman]
I am also very nervous this time.

8
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:49,040
I usually do not go on a blind date but I have given an opportunity again.

9
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:53,060
I am expecting to meet a nice person.

10

I look for someone that I can really hit it off.

14
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,600
Someone who likes my real self.

15
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:12,420
What should I say?

16
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:15,520
I look for someone who is more active.

17
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:18,560
Hello

18
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:19,900

00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:41,400
Q. Which body part you think is the best of yourself?

27
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:43,660
My legs.

28
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:45,280
Is it firm?

29
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:46,440
-Pardon?

30
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:47,080
-Pardon?
-Never mind.

31
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:48,900
Why the legs?

32
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:55,040
My legs are long and straight.

33
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:03,980
Q. What do you do and are you satisfied your job?

34
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:13,540
I work for an entertainment company and am highly satisfied with my job.

35
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:15,240
Then you would see a lot of celebrities?

00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:19,120
I see the artists in my company a lot.

37
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,740
You must have a very fine taste in men!

38
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:27,320
If she works for the entertainment company,

39
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:31,000
She would probably see a lot of good looking people quite often.

40
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:36,720
Q. Where do you live and who do you live with?

41
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:41,960
I live by myself in Sangam-dong.

42
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,400
Really?

43
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,620
If you live alone, aren’t you worried much?

44
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:54,240
I am used to do all by myself.

45
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:58,220
The house I live in has also been handled by myself.

46
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:00,900
I am independent that way.

47
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:06,180
I moved closer to the word ‘Sangam’

48
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:09,720
I used to work at Sangam.

49
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:13,460
I also like someone who is independent.

50
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:22,000
Q. What would you do when dating someone?

51
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:24,200
Do you like surfing?

52
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:26,500
I have never surfed before.

53
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:29,440
If I have a chance, I would teach you how to.

54
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,700
Thank you.

55
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:36,700
Q. Who do you picture when you hear my voice?

56
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:41,240
It can be one of celebrities.

57
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:44,640
You sound like you are funny.

58
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:49,760
If I pick one from celebrities,

59
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:54,300
‘Yoon Du Jun’(Highlight) a like?

60
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,240
Thank you.

61
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:01,620
Yoon Du Jun. Women like Yoon Du Jun.

62
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,820
How can I ever be like Yoon Du Jun?

63
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:07,040
It is funny but I once have been told

64
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:09,220
that I look alike Nicholas Cage.

65
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:14,380
What is one thing that I must know to get closer to you?

66
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:19,500
I like to drink when dating.

67
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:23,360
I prefer that kind of dating.

68
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:25,560
Do you drink a lot?

69
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:27,760
I like to drink.

70
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,400
I can drink in food truck (Pojang Macha)

71
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:37,460
when sharing each other’s difficulties while feeling very close.

72
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:45,040
I prefer that kind of dating style. Friend-like. I want those to be similar.

73
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:49,480
Is there any specific place that you would like to take your girlfriend?

74
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,100
Spain.

75
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:54,160
In what point?

76
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:58,700
I can guide her through with my Spanish skills.

77
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:00,500
You can speak Spanish?

78
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:01,780
Yes

79
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:07,240
He can speak Spanish so he told me that he could

80
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:09,500
guide me through any time.

81
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:13,060
So I thought it would be very good to travel with him.

82
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:18,520
You might not like it if you really hear it but

83
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:22,200
If we have a chance to visit Spain together,

84
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:25,180
I can guide you through the streets

85
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:27,480
and visit Madrid

86
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:29,480
Barcelona,

87
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:32,460
and see soccer games together

88
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:35,900
Lastly I would like to have a beer together.

89
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,620
Do you like to drink?

90
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:40,600
Yes I do

91
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,000
I like drinking in food trucks. (Pojang Macha)

92
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:47,640
Are you a drunk?

93
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:50,620
I tend to wink a lot when I am drunk.

94
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:52,460
To people around you?

95
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:54,360
To people that I am drinking with

96
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,960
I see

97
00:05:58,340 --> 00:05:59,700
I do not know how to wink.

98
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:01,020
Like this?

99
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:07,120
Q. What is the worst behavior that a guy does?

100
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:09,360
When we are in a restaurant,

101
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:13,080
I frown upon those who are not nice to the workers there

102
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:16,360
I like people who know how to behave to others.

103
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:19,560
I always think that I must do also.

104
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:22,380
I loved her answer.

105
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:26,320
I also think of being respectful to others as the most important quality.

106
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:36,060
Q. Between passionate love and intimate love, what do you prefer?

107
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:38,400
I prefer the passionate one.

108
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:42,200
I see

109
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:45,200
It is my preference.

110
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:53,220
I prefer more intimate and committed style these days.

111
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,880
Friendly relationship?

112
00:06:57,180 --> 00:06:59,080
Q. What is your bucket list?

113
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:02,420
What is the one that you must try?

114
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:05,060
Blind date it is.

115
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:06,560
Pardon?

116
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:09,680
Never mind. I like to do bungee jumping.

117
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:12,280
With girlfriend.

118
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:16,740
What if that girlfriend is afraid of it and does not want do it?

119
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:18,800
I would jump alone.

120
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:21,540
I would persuade her to do it together.

121
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:23,940
but if I can’t…

122
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:27,540
It is on how much she trusts me.

123
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:32,000
If it is a love at first sight, would you be a couple on that day or not?

124
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:33,300
I would

125
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:34,420
A reason for that is?

126
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:35,720
Because I fell in love with that person.

127
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:37,540
Are you being friendly?

128
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,360
Blind-Date Finished

129
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:46,120
Now it is a time to check each other out!

130
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,440
-Hello
-Hello

131
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:04,000
Nice meeting you.

132
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,320
Nice meeting you too.

133
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:08,760
Q. (During Blind-Date) How do you feel? 
I loved it.

134
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,900
I could really talk to her.

135
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:18,680
I could see him being active and trying to make me comfortable

136
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:23,540
but I think it was a bit too much.

137
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:28,040
Q. How do you feel after Blind-Date?
After talking to her, she matched with my ideal type.

138
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:30,100
She is 120% matched.

139
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:34,640
I was not that moved

140
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,840
by his characters.
