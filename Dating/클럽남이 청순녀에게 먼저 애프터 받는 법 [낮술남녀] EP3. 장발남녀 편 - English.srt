2,3

00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:04,680
Hello

3
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:11,960
LONG HAIRED BLIND DATES

4
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:13,940

7
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:17,720
What is your name?

8
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:18,640
My name is Lee Gon,

9
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:20,000
How about we take a shot first?

10
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:20,820
Sure

11
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:22,880
I can’t.. I need a drink

12
00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:30,600
How old are you?

13
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:32,080
I’m 24.

14
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:33,860
25, I’m 25.

15
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:34,960
25?

16
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:38,040
I need more shots

17
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:45,580
THE PROFESSION THAT SUITS JEONG SEO-WOO’S FIRST IMPRESSION IS?

18
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:47,120
umm...

19
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:48,400
A stewardess?

20
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:49,000
Stewardess

21
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:49,740
nope!

22
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:52,740
If you’re wrong, you have to take a shot.

23
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:53,980
ah

24
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:57,600
Why do you think I’d be a stewardess?

25
00:00:58,180 --> 00:00:59,180
It’s just..

26
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:04,220
Why why do you laugh?

27
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:05,220
What do you think my job is?

28
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:07,980
Well, maybe you are a professional dancer?

29
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:09,160
Are you not?

30
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:10,240
Did I make a mistake?

31
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:11,040
Something similar

32
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,400
I’m preparing to become a model,

33
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:13,260
A model, okay

34
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:14,620
That’s why I’m growing my hair long.

35
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:16,220
I wanted to add some character

36
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:17,360
Character?

37
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:19,080
Yes, to my identity as a model

38
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:21,160
It doesn’t look weird?

39
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:22,020
Not at all

40
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:23,980
Some girls don’t like long haired guys

41
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:24,940
Your hair is pretty

42
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:26,340
I’m relieved

43
00:01:28,355 --> 00:01:32,900
THE MOST FREQUENT QUESTION THAT LEE GON GETS ASKED ON BLIND DATES IS ____

44
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:35,740
How exactly long is your hair?

45
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:36,960
I haven’t measured it

46
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:37,480
Oh really?

47
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:39,080
Do ladies usually measure their hair?

48
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:40,560
No we don’t but..

49
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:42,887
“What kind of hair treatments do you use?”

50
00:01:42,887 --> 00:01:44,460
I’d get that question a lot

51
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:45,580
Seriously, which one do you use?

52
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:47,480
Currently I use Kera***

53
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:48,080
Kera***?

54
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:52,175
I applied some hair oil too you know

55
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:54,400
Maybe my hair is too long?

56
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,220
You have that French vibe

57
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:59,000
French or kind of like a hippie

58
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,580
But yeah that’s what I’m going for, why I kept it long

59
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:02,180
Oh really?

60
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:03,280
Yeah there’s a bit of that

61
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:10,000
JEONG SEO-WOO GLANCES AT WHICH PART OF BODY FIRST WHEN SHE SEES A MAN

62
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,180
His face?

63
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:13,100
Wrong!

64
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:15,240
Don’t judge me weird

65
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,960
I see a man’s booty first

66
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:21,280
Firstly?

67
00:02:22,485 --> 00:02:25,545
Yes it’s that I like men who work out

68
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:29,900
Oh but isn’t it a bit weird to check out butts first?

69
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:32,220
Well I don’t stare at it

70
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:33,820
So just a glance ?

71
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:35,060
That’s something new

72
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:36,000
I haven’t seen anyone like that

73
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:36,780
Oh really?

74
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:38,580
I’ve never heard of someone checking out butts first

75
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:42,040
LEE-GON HATES THE FOOD _____

76
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,840
What’s your guess?

77
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,500
Oyster

78
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:46,300
Oyster?

79
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:48,620
The answer..

80
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:49,760
Am I wrong?

81
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:50,740
Yes

82
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:52,340
I wrote that I hated Jajangmyeon (black bean sauce noodles)

83
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:53,100
Do you like them?

84
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:53,780
No I don’t like it either

85
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:54,640
Oh really?

86
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,000
That’s a relief

87
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:57,620
What about your favorite food?

88
00:02:58,340 --> 00:02:59,460
The classic food?

89
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:00,140
The classic food?

90
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:02,360
Shaved Ice with Red-beans, red beans,

91
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,180
Are those classics?

92
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,560
Cold bean-soup noodles and those kinds  I enjoy them

93
00:03:05,975 --> 00:03:08,755
I am into classic movies too

94
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:10,580
So you really like ‘classics’

95
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:13,120
Yes that gives me a little edge to my image

96
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:15,200
So you like things with good vibes

97
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,760
No not things with good vibes

98
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:19,100
But things that make me look like I have good vibes

99
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:20,380
So you’re pretentious,

100
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:21,480
oops I’m sorry

101
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:23,095
So your image is important to you

102
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:24,340
So it’s just a showy thing

103
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:27,180
You know things people call “HIP”,

104
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:28,100
like a hippie

105
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:35,100
LEE GON RECENTLY MOVED BECAUSE OF ______

106
00:03:36,365 --> 00:03:37,365
Bugs?

107
00:03:37,425 --> 00:03:38,635
You’re wrong

108
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,780
You didn’t have to be too harsh

109
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:44,140
It was because the clubs

110
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:44,640
You go to clubs?

111
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:45,140
Yes

112
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:45,760
Really?

113
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:46,500
Yeah

114
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:47,800
What time do you go and come home?

115
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:50,955
I’d go there 11 pm get out by 6-7 in the morning?

116
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:53,080
6 or 7? You have great stamina

117
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:55,160
But there are others who go more intense than I do

118
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:56,360
I thought I am not intense enough

119
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,720
Which one do you usually go to?

120
00:03:57,780 --> 00:03:58,840
Club ARE**

121
00:03:58,840 --> 00:03:59,680
Club ARE**?

122
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:00,760
Then to where..?

123
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:02,480
I used to live in Nonhyun, but

124
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:03,480
I moved to Sin-sa

125
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:05,860
So you moved already?

126
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:06,520
Yes

127
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:10,740
I think...

128
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:14,000
I saw you before…

129
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,360
Me?

130
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:16,660
For real?

131
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:17,620
Where?

132
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:18,860
At the club Are**

133
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:19,900
Seriously?

134
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,860
My looks stand out that’s why

135
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:27,920
Shall we move on?

136
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:31,860
JEONG SEO WOO’S LONGEST RELATIONSHIP LASTED FOR ____

137
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:34,820
2 years?

138
00:04:35,325 --> 00:04:36,325
Wrong

139
00:04:37,155 --> 00:04:40,175
It was almost 3 years

140
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:42,640
That’s pretty long

141
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:43,140
Yes

142
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:44,560
But you looked like that type

143
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,140
Why?

144
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:48,020
Don’t know but from the start

145
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:49,640
I sensed that you’re kind of conservative

146
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:51,060
How about you?

147
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:53,240
How long do you think I went out with someone?

148
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:55,100
About 1..

149
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:56,300
100 days?

150
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:57,220
Correct

151
00:04:57,220 --> 00:04:57,920
Really?

152
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,460
That’s right 100 days

153
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:01,940
It’s written all over your face

154
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:02,620
I get it

155
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:09,900
LEE GON NEEDS TO DATE AT LEAST__ TIMES BEFORE DECIDING ON A RELATIONSHIP

156
00:05:11,515 --> 00:05:12,515
3 times?

157
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:17,520
I got it wrong again

158
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:18,820
You got 100 days right

159
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:23,880
I think 1 time is enough to decide on a relationship

160
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:24,460
Oh really?

161
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:27,560
Then approximately how many dates do you need to decide?

162
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:30,340
Well in my case at least I should see 10 times

163
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:30,860
10 times?

164
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:34,940
I think I need to at least spend a one season with the person to decide

165
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:36,100
I tend to be discreet

166
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:37,340
I’m not saying I am indiscreet

167
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,080
Yes of course

168
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:42,200
But what if you have like crazy crush on this person

169
00:05:42,375 --> 00:05:45,000
Then I’d see him like 3 times a week?

170
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,680
Oh okay that’s how you’d do it

171
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:49,820
So 10 dates is like a check-list for you to be in a relationship?

172
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:51,760
No no, it’s not like that.

173
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:55,400
But you know you can go on a relationship and break up quickly

174
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:56,100
Sure

175
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:58,660
I’m saying that’s not a bad thing

176
00:05:58,660 --> 00:06:02,380
I tent to think ‘We were meant to break up soon or later’

177
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:04,700
You said you’d meet 10 times before deciding right?

178
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:10,460
To me that is also part of a relationship, more like dating

179
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:17,340
LEE GON CAN GO OUT WITH HIS BUDDY’S EX-GIRLFRIEND OR NOT

180
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,100
You can

181
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:20,120
Yes I think I can

182
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:23,560
Really?

183
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:24,100
Yes

184
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:28,715
Let’s say she goes out with me and we get married

185
00:06:28,715 --> 00:06:29,715
and have a happy life,

186
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:30,820
You were destined?

187
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:31,660
That’s right

188
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:33,320
we were destined to be together

189
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,300
That’s how I feel. So the past of dating my friend is out of...

190
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:36,600
But what if it’s your best friend’s ex-girlfriend?

191
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:37,760
Best friend?

192
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:38,900
Can you still… ?

193
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:40,860
Wouldn’t he understand because he is my friend?

194
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:43,100
I don’t think I’ll even get to have feelings for the person

195
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:45,220
If you really really have crush on that person?

196
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:47,460
I don’t think I’ll see him as one of datable guys,

197
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:49,320
like “He is not a man”

198
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:52,920
That’s how you feel

199
00:06:53,215 --> 00:06:54,245
Okay okay

200
00:06:54,985 --> 00:06:58,900
JEONG SEO-WOO CAN GO ON A TRIP WITH HER BOYFRIEND AFTER ___ DAYS

201
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:01,660
1 year?

202
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:02,200
Wrong

203
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:03,960
Honestly,

204
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:07,305
if it’s someone that I want as a boyfriend,

205
00:07:07,305 --> 00:07:08,960
I can go without starting a relationship

206
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:09,640
So 0 days?

207
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:12,600
But then that’d be our 1st day of relationship

208
00:07:14,765 --> 00:07:15,765
Hmm that’s good

209
00:07:18,225 --> 00:07:19,795
I get it

210
00:07:20,245 --> 00:07:23,185
You had that kind of conservative impression on me

211
00:07:23,185 --> 00:07:25,500
So I expected you’d need a longer time

212
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:26,780
This is hard

213
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:31,040
IN A RELATIONSHIP, LEE GON’S DEAL-BREAKER IS _____

214
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:33,540
Can you give me some hints?

215
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:36,320
It was brought up a lot today

216
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:37,560
All I remember is clubs

217
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:38,460
Only clubs?

218
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:41,520
That’s not it

219
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:42,300
Am I wrong?

220
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:46,440
What is it then?

221
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:48,000
My hair

222
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:48,840
Your hair?

223
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:50,660
Someone telling me to cut my hair short

224
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:54,340
But honestly isn’t it something you can respect if you love that person?

225
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:57,160
I want that person to not care about my hair

226
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:59,560
It’s same me with short or long hair.

227
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:00,860
Doesn’t it hurt your feelings frankly?

228
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:02,840
Yes a little bit

229
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:03,720
Disappointed?

230
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:08,600
When I get a haircut, I was actually planning to donate my hair

231
00:08:08,665 --> 00:08:11,225
I think I can cut my hair short anytime

232
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:14,520
but if I’m being told to do so
I’d be disappointed

233
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:19,540
Can you give up on clubbing, if not your hair?

234
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:23,320
When I’m dating someone I usually don’t go clubbing

235
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:24,320
Oh you don’t?

236
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:28,280
I usually go there to hang out with friends so

237
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:31,000
I tend to think I’m a good person,

238
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:31,700
You are

239
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:32,840
How do you know?

240
00:08:35,055 --> 00:08:36,055
Well anyway

241
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:42,000
Me clubbing and my long hair makes me look like a shallow person

242
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:45,665
But actually inside I’m not that hip you know?

243
00:08:45,665 --> 00:08:47,960
So I think I’ll stop going (clubbing) when I have a girlfriend

244
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,860
Because I prefer spending time with her

245
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:56,260
JEONG SEO-WOO’S MOST IDEAL RATIO OF CAREER AND LOVE IS:

246
00:08:57,780 --> 00:08:58,520
4 to 6?

247
00:08:58,520 --> 00:08:59,640
4 is career?

248
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:00,400
Yes

249
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:01,540
Wrong

250
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:02,460
it was close.

251
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:04,860
Career is 6 and love is 4 in my ratio

252
00:09:05,465 --> 00:09:06,935
For now?

253
00:09:07,285 --> 00:09:10,385
It’s not like I have a specific job so

254
00:09:10,455 --> 00:09:12,615
But if I get to settle down,

255
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:14,740
I think the love part will grow

256
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:16,120
In my case it’s something like 3: 7

257
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:17,420
Career is 3?

258
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:18,200
Yes

259
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:19,760
Or 4 to 7? 4 to 6 I mean

260
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:21,340
4 to 7 gosh

261
00:09:22,835 --> 00:09:25,785
Then can you give up your career for love?

262
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:27,860
Not giving up

263
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:30,220
but even if I’m not doing what I love as a job,

264
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:34,080
if I love my family I am ok with that job

265
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:37,140
So I consider happiness at home as bigger happiness

266
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:39,660
So it’s like seeking out a bigger happiness

267
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,500
I think I agree with you

268
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:50,320
COMPARED TO THE FIRST IMPRESSION
JEONG SEO-WOO HAS SAME / DIFFERENT FEELINGS TOWARDS LEE GON

269
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:52,160
Mine are different

270
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:52,800
Different?

271
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:53,300
Yes

272
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:54,020
Is that so?

273
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:58,240
At first I thought you’d be over sensitive, to be honest?

274
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:01,360
But I think you’re gentle, as I speak with you more

275
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:04,080
And you seem very honest

276
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:07,520
I think we share similar values

277
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:12,440
Similar but the different answers come from different situations but in the same lines

278
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:13,040
Yes

279
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:16,740
it’s like we have similar styles

280
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:18,220
Yeah I agree

281
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,800
Would you like to keep in touch ?

282
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:26,700
Umm

283
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:31,780
I think so, yes
