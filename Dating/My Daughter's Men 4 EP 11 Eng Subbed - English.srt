1
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:12,967
The dads are watching! My Daughters' Men season 4!

2
00:00:13,398 --> 00:00:18,703
I hope the daughters start beautiful relationships before the

3
00:00:18,728 --> 00:00:24,117
year ends so they can be happy next year and be full of smiles.

4
00:00:24,208 --> 00:00:28,801
The couples start planning what to do for Christmas when the year is ending.

5
00:00:28,998 --> 00:00:32,880
Who do you guys want your daughters to spend Christmas with?

6
00:00:32,959 --> 00:00:36,346
I heard who you spend Christmas with determines

7
00:00:36,371 --> 00:00:39,263
who your real girlfriend or boyfriend is.

8
00:00:40,153 --> 00:00:43,447
If you were close to someone and they disappear on

9
00:00:43,472 --> 00:00:46,700
Christmas, it means you guys weren't really close.

10
00:00:47,529 --> 00:00:49,200
Will Seok-hee be with her family?

11
00:00:49,224 --> 00:00:53,349
She can hang with Yo-Han, and they can come over afterward.

12
00:00:53,374 --> 00:00:54,568
Together?

13
00:00:54,693 --> 00:00:56,693
You've really opened up a lot.

14
00:00:56,718 --> 00:00:58,272
What are you doing for Christmas?

15
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:00,364
Christmas? I don't have any plans.

16
00:01:01,302 --> 00:01:02,411
Well I'm busy.

17
00:01:06,959 --> 00:01:10,958
I'm sure you guys know, but Joo-yeon had a blind date

18
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:13,440
and Soo-bin had a blind date too.

19
00:01:13,592 --> 00:01:16,357
- From last week, was it Joo-min? - Yes.

20
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:19,220
I don't know where he's from but anyway...

21
00:01:19,615 --> 00:01:22,372
The camera is zooming in on you right now.

22
00:01:24,045 --> 00:01:27,138
He had a really nice body and looked sharp.

23
00:01:27,178 --> 00:01:31,146
I'm worried that Soo-min is going to fall for another guy.

24
00:01:31,209 --> 00:01:33,693
Jae-young, how do you think today will go?

25
00:01:33,826 --> 00:01:36,411
I'm sure they talked a lot.

26
00:01:36,436 --> 00:01:39,216
Yes, I'm looking forward to this week.

27
00:01:41,771 --> 00:01:43,802
This sounds like Seok-hee and Yo-Han.

28
00:01:43,865 --> 00:01:45,380
This has to be them.

29
00:01:45,482 --> 00:01:47,682
This is so obvious who it's from.

30
00:01:48,881 --> 00:01:50,849
Your body looks like a piece of art.

31
00:01:52,232 --> 00:01:54,107
Your face looks like a piece of art.

32
00:01:54,170 --> 00:01:56,646
You don't try to kiss anymore.

33
00:01:57,106 --> 00:01:58,306
He's holding back.

34
00:01:58,331 --> 00:02:00,198
My mom thinks it's for real.

35
00:02:02,803 --> 00:02:06,060
The mothers think it's for real.

36
00:02:06,085 --> 00:02:07,630
Even when you tell them no.

37
00:02:07,638 --> 00:02:11,036
- If she's talking about the body... - It's Soo-bin.

38
00:02:11,084 --> 00:02:12,716
- It's obvious. - Soo-bin.

39
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:15,021
Since Joo-min has a nice body.

40
00:02:15,428 --> 00:02:17,732
That means she saw him shirtless.

41
00:02:17,896 --> 00:02:19,638
- Why? - They must've done that.

42
00:02:19,663 --> 00:02:23,330
- Did they go to a pool. - He must've danced to a song

43
00:02:27,661 --> 00:02:29,349
That's so old.

44
00:02:31,287 --> 00:02:33,240
Isn't that the countryside?

45
00:02:37,404 --> 00:02:39,671
That must be an old train station.

46
00:02:39,717 --> 00:02:41,317
Old stations are pretty.

47
00:02:42,724 --> 00:02:43,966
Who is it?

48
00:02:44,787 --> 00:02:45,787
Who is it?

49
00:02:46,553 --> 00:02:50,107
I told you it's Soo-bin! It's Soo-bin and Joo-min.

50
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:57,919
She's hiding?

51
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:06,294
It's cute how she's shy.

52
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:12,372
I'm embarrassed.

53
00:03:13,231 --> 00:03:14,700
- Hi. - Hi.

54
00:03:15,005 --> 00:03:17,107
Why won't you look me in the eyes?

55
00:03:17,162 --> 00:03:18,427
Is she still shy?

56
00:03:18,732 --> 00:03:20,755
- She must be shy. - I heard that's a good thing.

57
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:21,780
Yeah.

58
00:03:21,950 --> 00:03:24,068
it means she likes him.

59
00:03:24,849 --> 00:03:26,357
I recently went to Da Nang.

60
00:03:26,412 --> 00:03:27,412
Oh yeah.

61
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:29,294
- Do you remember? - Of course.

62
00:03:29,412 --> 00:03:31,740
- I saw you the day before I left. - Yeah.

63
00:03:32,053 --> 00:03:33,053
Hold on.

64
00:03:33,078 --> 00:03:35,107
They met without the cameras, right?

65
00:03:35,247 --> 00:03:41,443
After the blind date, Joo-min asked to meet with Soo-bin before he left for Da Nang.

66
00:03:41,568 --> 00:03:43,552
So they met the night before he left.

67
00:03:43,577 --> 00:03:46,474
Do you think he went to Da Nang alone?

68
00:03:46,662 --> 00:03:48,568
Oh my!

69
00:03:48,615 --> 00:03:49,615
That's scary.

70
00:03:50,036 --> 00:03:53,771
- I thought it wouldn't be awkward. - I feel really awkward right now.

71
00:03:56,865 --> 00:03:59,802
Stop looking at me! I'm embarrassed.

72
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:02,099
It's because you're pretty.

73
00:04:03,365 --> 00:04:05,098
You look pretty today too.

74
00:04:06,365 --> 00:04:09,232
It's because he really thinks she's pretty.

75
00:04:09,771 --> 00:04:12,849
The guy has to like the girl like that.

76
00:04:13,428 --> 00:04:15,083
I like this guy.

77
00:04:17,178 --> 00:04:18,178
What's this?

78
00:04:18,787 --> 00:04:19,787
A camera.

79
00:04:20,068 --> 00:04:22,716
I'm going to take the best picture of your life today.

80
00:04:22,818 --> 00:04:25,333
Her body is leaning towards the guy.

81
00:04:25,412 --> 00:04:27,879
- For real. - I think you're going to be bad.

82
00:04:28,318 --> 00:04:30,286
I'm kidding. I think you're going to be good.

83
00:04:30,388 --> 00:04:33,450
I took pictures for the whole 2 years I was in the army.

84
00:04:33,475 --> 00:04:35,654
- Oh he was a photographer. - There's such a thing?

85
00:04:35,685 --> 00:04:37,819
He was enlisted in a nice place.

86
00:04:38,154 --> 00:04:41,271
I got you a gift from Da Nang.

87
00:04:41,662 --> 00:04:42,662
Really?

88
00:04:43,021 --> 00:04:44,755
- From Da Nang. - A gift?

89
00:04:44,888 --> 00:04:46,088
It's from Da Nang.

90
00:04:46,248 --> 00:04:48,411
He must've gotten her that Vietnamese thing.

91
00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:51,957
It's the thing you said you wanted to eat. Bananas.

92
00:04:52,021 --> 00:04:53,221
The dried bananas.

93
00:04:53,246 --> 00:04:54,913
You asked me to get some.

94
00:04:55,076 --> 00:04:57,419
- You told me the night before. - I didn't know you really would.

95
00:04:57,474 --> 00:04:58,608
It's really good.

96
00:05:00,107 --> 00:05:01,568
And this is...

97
00:05:02,068 --> 00:05:03,068
Open it.

98
00:05:04,568 --> 00:05:05,568
What is that?

99
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:07,529
- Is it Ado Dai? - Bananas?

100
00:05:07,568 --> 00:05:08,568
Chocolate?

101
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:11,810
It's chocolate.

102
00:05:12,130 --> 00:05:13,138
Say ah.

103
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:15,583
- Is it good? - Yeah.

104
00:05:16,748 --> 00:05:18,333
You're not going to give me one?

105
00:05:18,381 --> 00:05:21,255
- I'll get it myself. - It must be so sweet for them.

106
00:05:21,349 --> 00:05:24,549
The two have gotten a lot closer than last week.

107
00:05:24,810 --> 00:05:27,318
- They met before Da Nang. - Meeting on their own must be big.

108
00:05:27,342 --> 00:05:31,044
Of course. And Soo-bin wants to be genuine.

109
00:05:31,271 --> 00:05:34,497
She wants to know how she feels without the cameras.

110
00:05:34,607 --> 00:05:35,607
Right.

111
00:05:36,912 --> 00:05:38,310
Isn't this place pretty?

112
00:05:38,335 --> 00:05:41,044
- Yeah, it's really pretty. - It has a nice vibe.

113
00:05:41,107 --> 00:05:42,966
- Do you want to look around? - Shall we?

114
00:05:43,021 --> 00:05:45,088
- Let's go inside. - Let's go.

115
00:05:49,678 --> 00:05:51,411
There's a place like that?

116
00:05:51,834 --> 00:05:52,834
The history.

117
00:05:53,256 --> 00:05:55,318
Wow, it's really pretty!

118
00:05:57,615 --> 00:05:59,458
They're memories.

119
00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:02,099
I love that old school vibe.

120
00:06:02,209 --> 00:06:04,755
- Doesn't that make you want to cry? - Look at the uniforms.

121
00:06:04,787 --> 00:06:05,854
Old school vibe.

122
00:06:06,224 --> 00:06:07,224
Yeah.

123
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:10,435
Have you had ice bars?

124
00:06:11,099 --> 00:06:13,216
- Ice bars! - That's so cool!

125
00:06:13,318 --> 00:06:15,982
I think I've seen that before. It opens only on one side.

126
00:06:16,021 --> 00:06:18,911
- A hand isn't going to pop out, right? - No.

127
00:06:19,107 --> 00:06:21,271
- What? - It's my second gift for you.

128
00:06:21,334 --> 00:06:22,600
- For real? - Yes.

129
00:06:22,732 --> 00:06:24,732
There's another gift in there?

130
00:06:24,812 --> 00:06:26,357
- For real? - Yes.

131
00:06:29,623 --> 00:06:32,036
Really? I had no idea.

132
00:06:32,084 --> 00:06:34,388
- Really? - This is crazy.

133
00:06:38,162 --> 00:06:39,693
It's a mood lamp.

134
00:06:39,718 --> 00:06:41,200
That's going to be pretty.

135
00:06:41,225 --> 00:06:43,575
You said you have a hard time falling asleep.

136
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:46,067
So have this on when you go to sleep.

137
00:06:46,443 --> 00:06:47,786
Thank you so much.

138
00:06:48,623 --> 00:06:50,357
Yay, this is great.

139
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:54,130
- But did you know? - Know what?

140
00:06:54,178 --> 00:06:55,927
There's a last gift.

141
00:06:56,068 --> 00:06:58,535
- There's more? - Yeah, look for it.

142
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:59,960
What's the last gift?

143
00:07:00,349 --> 00:07:02,490
You're very eager now.

144
00:07:02,951 --> 00:07:05,618
That means Joo-min really likes Soo-min.

145
00:07:05,787 --> 00:07:08,591
He bought her several gifts, not just one.

146
00:07:08,616 --> 00:07:11,161
That means he's that much more interested in her.

147
00:07:11,217 --> 00:07:14,107
He prepared everything because he didn't know what she'd like.

148
00:07:14,132 --> 00:07:16,536
So he was thinking about her the whole time.

149
00:07:16,561 --> 00:07:19,099
He thought of her whenever he looked at something.

150
00:07:19,131 --> 00:07:20,797
Jung-hoon is touched too.

151
00:07:22,451 --> 00:07:23,451
Look for it.

152
00:07:23,476 --> 00:07:26,224
- You didn't hide it here, right? - A scavenger hunt is a good idea.

153
00:07:26,349 --> 00:07:28,271
That's dirty. Don't touch it.

154
00:07:28,779 --> 00:07:30,646
They've gotten really close.

155
00:07:31,154 --> 00:07:32,154
Where is it?

156
00:07:32,646 --> 00:07:33,713
It's this thing.

157
00:07:34,553 --> 00:07:35,619
It's right here!

158
00:07:36,271 --> 00:07:37,693
Yay! I found it!

159
00:07:37,718 --> 00:07:39,802
What is that? I think it's going to have a card!

160
00:07:39,827 --> 00:07:41,271
She's good at finding stuff.

161
00:07:41,334 --> 00:07:42,880
- What is it? - Is it a necklace?

162
00:07:42,959 --> 00:07:44,559
- A bracelet? - A ring.

163
00:07:44,967 --> 00:07:46,232
It's a perfume!

164
00:07:46,638 --> 00:07:48,919
I love purple.

165
00:07:49,568 --> 00:07:50,763
- Really? - Yeah.

166
00:07:52,075 --> 00:07:53,865
I like scented things.

167
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,716
I love perfumes too.

168
00:07:57,443 --> 00:07:59,185
Scents are powerful.

169
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:01,732
There's a person you think of when you smell it.

170
00:08:01,795 --> 00:08:02,795
Of course.

171
00:08:03,928 --> 00:08:07,161
I got it for you so you can put it on whenever we meet.

172
00:08:07,170 --> 00:08:08,170
Okay?

173
00:08:08,185 --> 00:08:10,176
Okay, I'll put it on whenever I see you.

174
00:08:10,201 --> 00:08:12,268
- Thank you. - You're welcome.

175
00:08:15,303 --> 00:08:17,036
From a girl's perspective,

176
00:08:17,084 --> 00:08:22,325
do you feel burdened if a guy gives you gifts before you start dating?

177
00:08:22,435 --> 00:08:26,154
I think he prepared gifts that aren't burdensome.

178
00:08:26,224 --> 00:08:28,716
Rings would be burdensome.

179
00:08:28,849 --> 00:08:31,049
Oh, gifts that aren't too much...

180
00:08:31,529 --> 00:08:33,505
Do you think you can walk on it? Get ready.

181
00:08:33,530 --> 00:08:34,530
Ready.

182
00:08:34,592 --> 00:08:35,591
Go.

183
00:08:37,178 --> 00:08:38,380
Hold on.

184
00:08:39,771 --> 00:08:42,091
They can walk on it because the trains don't go on it.

185
00:08:42,131 --> 00:08:43,664
It's a strange feeling.

186
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:47,120
They say the love is stronger the less you fall.

187
00:08:48,521 --> 00:08:50,857
Do you want me to hold you? Wait...

188
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:53,154
I can't get my balance!

189
00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:54,966
I'm trying to stay focused.

190
00:08:56,053 --> 00:08:58,253
She's doing really well in heels.

191
00:08:58,310 --> 00:08:59,333
She's like a model!

192
00:08:59,342 --> 00:09:01,075
Did Soo-bin do gymnastics?

193
00:09:01,170 --> 00:09:02,770
That's how models train.

194
00:09:03,122 --> 00:09:06,825
- Should we take a picture together? - Okay, let's take one together.

195
00:09:12,646 --> 00:09:16,607
They're going to put it on timer and take it together.

196
00:09:16,654 --> 00:09:17,654
Yeah.

197
00:09:17,755 --> 00:09:20,427
A picture on the train tracks would be really pretty.

198
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,560
People used to take pictures like that a lot.

199
00:09:23,585 --> 00:09:25,521
One, two, three! And then run.

200
00:09:25,546 --> 00:09:26,546
I'm here.

201
00:09:27,771 --> 00:09:29,438
Come closer a little bit.

202
00:09:29,482 --> 00:09:30,482
A little bit.

203
00:09:30,873 --> 00:09:32,286
I'm walking on it really well!

204
00:09:32,311 --> 00:09:33,444
Okay that's good.

205
00:09:33,467 --> 00:09:35,533
She discovered a hidden talent.

206
00:09:39,888 --> 00:09:40,888
Hurry!

207
00:09:41,435 --> 00:09:42,435
Get your pose.

208
00:09:42,818 --> 00:09:45,607
I think he's going to casually grab her hand so she doesn't fall.

209
00:09:45,631 --> 00:09:47,810
- This is hard. - Your hand!

210
00:09:52,998 --> 00:09:54,531
I do this all the time!

211
00:09:54,556 --> 00:09:56,005
They grabbed hands.

212
00:09:56,138 --> 00:09:57,310
Did it take it?

213
00:09:59,106 --> 00:10:00,497
This is fun.

214
00:10:01,841 --> 00:10:04,279
This guy is very charming.

215
00:10:06,404 --> 00:10:09,732
- No, this is too much. - This isn't right.

216
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:20,138
But he still grabs it carefully.

217
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:26,180
They took it several times.

218
00:10:26,927 --> 00:10:28,602
This one turned out nice.

219
00:10:36,044 --> 00:10:37,786
There's a place like that?

220
00:10:37,865 --> 00:10:40,044
That looks fun!

221
00:10:40,474 --> 00:10:42,068
Where is that place?

222
00:10:47,256 --> 00:10:49,693
So Joo-min showed his body here.

223
00:10:50,746 --> 00:10:53,193
Oh here! You're right!

224
00:10:53,334 --> 00:10:56,200
He took off the top of his suit.

225
00:11:05,919 --> 00:11:07,560
That's cheating!

226
00:11:07,950 --> 00:11:09,271
That's cheating!

227
00:11:09,296 --> 00:11:11,271
It was him!

228
00:11:18,388 --> 00:11:20,513
- Look at her smiling! - She's shy!

229
00:11:20,583 --> 00:11:21,810
I can't look at him!

230
00:11:21,834 --> 00:11:23,372
You can wash clothes on his abs!

231
00:11:23,397 --> 00:11:24,732
So-Jin is funny!

232
00:11:31,216 --> 00:11:32,909
- That's crazy. - What's crazy?

233
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:35,279
Oh yeah, you said you were in a competition.

234
00:11:35,357 --> 00:11:37,357
That's so cool.

235
00:11:37,701 --> 00:11:39,622
That's so cool.

236
00:11:40,092 --> 00:11:42,158
Why is she staring so intently?

237
00:11:42,943 --> 00:11:44,638
She's driving me crazy.

238
00:11:44,685 --> 00:11:46,619
She's staring too much at it.

239
00:11:46,685 --> 00:11:48,263
Your body looks like a piece of art.

240
00:11:48,318 --> 00:11:49,685
- Really? - Yeah.

241
00:11:49,818 --> 00:11:51,685
Your face looks like a piece of art.

242
00:11:51,717 --> 00:11:54,383
He said her face is like a piece of art.

243
00:11:59,294 --> 00:12:00,607
I'm embarrassed.

244
00:12:01,505 --> 00:12:03,639
That's enough! Put your suit on!

245
00:12:03,708 --> 00:12:04,841
Put your suit on.

246
00:12:05,013 --> 00:12:07,021
This is cheating.

247
00:12:07,046 --> 00:12:09,872
Soo-bin couldn't look at him in the eyes.

248
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:12,732
But now that he's shirtless, she can look at him.

249
00:12:12,810 --> 00:12:14,372
She's only looking at his stomach.

250
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:15,740
My goodness...

251
00:12:20,185 --> 00:12:21,732
- Why? - What do you mean?

252
00:12:21,757 --> 00:12:22,757
Keep it off.

253
00:12:22,795 --> 00:12:25,404
You think you can handle it?

254
00:12:25,662 --> 00:12:26,662
She likes it.

255
00:12:28,357 --> 00:12:30,021
So-Jin loves it.

256
00:12:36,498 --> 00:12:39,904
It has an advantage because you don't have to swim.

257
00:12:39,982 --> 00:12:42,536
- It's better for first timers. - Oh really?

258
00:12:43,013 --> 00:12:46,544
Swimming and standing by yourself is really hard.

259
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:53,732
Look at his arm muscles.

260
00:12:53,826 --> 00:12:56,138
Who cares if he has a nice body. He's shaking.

261
00:12:56,162 --> 00:12:57,162
You're right.

262
00:12:57,693 --> 00:13:00,450
We're all feeling inferior right now.

263
00:13:00,529 --> 00:13:03,771
If you put people like us there, we'd get up very fast.

264
00:13:03,796 --> 00:13:06,729
We get back up because our bodies are round.

265
00:13:09,170 --> 00:13:10,786
This is really hard.

266
00:13:12,302 --> 00:13:13,841
Put your arms out straight.

267
00:13:13,943 --> 00:13:16,417
Seeing how Soo-bin was on top of the train tracks,

268
00:13:16,442 --> 00:13:18,623
I think she'd be good at getting her balance.

269
00:13:18,717 --> 00:13:21,107
I think she'd have good core strength.

270
00:13:21,201 --> 00:13:22,325
Go Soo-bin!

271
00:13:29,373 --> 00:13:30,904
Soo-bin is athletic.

272
00:13:31,021 --> 00:13:33,380
She needs to let go and go straight up.

273
00:13:33,443 --> 00:13:34,843
You can't get scared.

274
00:13:35,154 --> 00:13:37,732
- Look at her balance. - I hope she doesn't fall.

275
00:13:43,545 --> 00:13:45,083
You're really good!

276
00:13:55,474 --> 00:13:57,560
So she doesn't get pushed back.

277
00:13:59,044 --> 00:14:00,302
She's good!

278
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:04,396
She should straighten her back.

279
00:14:15,444 --> 00:14:17,765
She can't let go of the rope.

280
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:19,957
That's how strong the water is?

281
00:14:20,124 --> 00:14:21,632
The water is super strong.

282
00:14:21,742 --> 00:14:23,675
He didn't get to protect her.

283
00:14:23,968 --> 00:14:26,168
He should've jumped in after her!

284
00:14:28,772 --> 00:14:30,179
Are you okay?

285
00:14:30,233 --> 00:14:32,124
She's mad.

286
00:14:33,812 --> 00:14:36,038
- She looks worn out. - How cute.

287
00:14:38,625 --> 00:14:40,312
I think she's going to let go.

288
00:14:40,382 --> 00:14:42,116
It's time for her revenge.

289
00:14:42,257 --> 00:14:44,924
I think she's going to pull really hard.

290
00:14:48,194 --> 00:14:50,562
Oh no!

291
00:14:50,625 --> 00:14:51,891
They fell together?

292
00:14:54,023 --> 00:14:56,226
It's fun even if you fall.

293
00:15:00,359 --> 00:15:01,359
Are you okay?

294
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:05,750
I'm okay.

295
00:15:06,241 --> 00:15:08,834
But you looked good even when you fell.

296
00:15:08,843 --> 00:15:10,077
How annoying.

297
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:13,671
I guess he looks good doing anything.

298
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:20,788
She thought that looked good?

299
00:15:23,835 --> 00:15:24,944
That looks fun.

300
00:15:27,812 --> 00:15:30,241
You get really hungry after you play in the water.

301
00:15:30,273 --> 00:15:31,273
For real.

302
00:15:31,656 --> 00:15:33,593
- It's the best. - Yeah.

303
00:15:34,125 --> 00:15:35,194
- Cheers. - Cheers.

304
00:15:35,234 --> 00:15:37,507
- Good work. - You too.

305
00:15:40,163 --> 00:15:41,496
This is really good.

306
00:15:41,648 --> 00:15:42,648
It's good.

307
00:15:43,054 --> 00:15:46,437
There's a climbing wall next to us.

308
00:15:46,937 --> 00:15:48,270
You want to do that?

309
00:15:48,296 --> 00:15:50,763
Let's try it and fall a couple times.

310
00:15:51,156 --> 00:15:53,702
- Climbing isn't going to be easy. - It's not easy.

311
00:15:53,727 --> 00:15:55,819
It's okay, I'll catch you if you fall.

312
00:15:55,844 --> 00:15:57,218
I'll catch you from the ground.

313
00:15:57,243 --> 00:15:58,194
- Really? - Yeah.

314
00:15:58,219 --> 00:15:59,921
I'll catch you even if my arms break.

315
00:15:59,946 --> 00:16:01,479
- Are you sure? - Yes.

316
00:16:02,367 --> 00:16:03,967
I'm strong. Don't worry.

317
00:16:04,179 --> 00:16:09,312
This is a workout date too, but it's very different from Seok-hee and Yo-Han.

318
00:16:10,296 --> 00:16:13,343
- That's the place. - Climbing sounds fun!

319
00:16:14,242 --> 00:16:15,242
Let's go.

320
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:19,171
That's where the climbing wall is.

321
00:16:19,196 --> 00:16:20,196
Yeah.

322
00:16:21,968 --> 00:16:23,522
They're going to try that?

323
00:16:23,547 --> 00:16:24,515
It's really hard.

324
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:27,022
- You put the safety equipment on. - But it's still hard.

325
00:16:27,047 --> 00:16:29,468
- Let me get a feel for it. - It's a whole body workout.

326
00:16:29,493 --> 00:16:30,812
You need a strong grip.

327
00:16:30,837 --> 00:16:33,704
It really must work out your arms and legs.

328
00:16:34,218 --> 00:16:37,163
- They're putting on the safety equipment. - They need it.

329
00:16:37,195 --> 00:16:38,374
I'm nervous.

330
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:40,468
I want to try stuff like that too.

331
00:16:40,562 --> 00:16:42,467
- Want to place a bet? - A bet?

332
00:16:42,843 --> 00:16:44,921
- Let's pick the punishment. - Yes.

333
00:16:46,421 --> 00:16:47,905
What should it be?

334
00:16:48,085 --> 00:16:51,233
Compliment each other for 30 seconds nonstop.

335
00:16:51,421 --> 00:16:52,755
- Got it. - Got it.

336
00:16:52,812 --> 00:16:53,879
- Deal. - Deal.

337
00:16:55,984 --> 00:16:56,984
Get set, go!

338
00:17:08,656 --> 00:17:10,819
I don't think I can do this.

339
00:17:11,093 --> 00:17:12,427
This is really hard.

340
00:17:14,765 --> 00:17:16,032
Why is she so good?

341
00:17:16,057 --> 00:17:17,757
Soo-bin, can you slow down?

342
00:17:17,906 --> 00:17:19,906
He's like Yo-Han with muscles.

343
00:17:20,382 --> 00:17:21,449
- Right? - Yes.

344
00:17:21,554 --> 00:17:24,390
He's a little weird too.

345
00:17:25,070 --> 00:17:26,624
I grabbed the wrong one!

346
00:17:30,039 --> 00:17:31,382
Oh no!

347
00:17:32,601 --> 00:17:35,382
- She lost strength in her wrists. - Of course.

348
00:17:35,445 --> 00:17:36,796
I don't think I can do it.

349
00:17:36,828 --> 00:17:41,094
The guy needs to make a decision whether to be on her pace or...

350
00:17:41,187 --> 00:17:43,187
- He's not going to be. - No.

351
00:17:44,054 --> 00:17:46,515
What if you really reach the top?

352
00:17:48,726 --> 00:17:50,351
He's good!

353
00:17:51,625 --> 00:17:52,625
No!

354
00:17:52,734 --> 00:17:54,546
Don't reach the top!

355
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:57,999
No...

356
00:18:03,921 --> 00:18:04,921
Is he done?

357
00:18:05,890 --> 00:18:07,424
Wow, he did a good job.

358
00:18:08,617 --> 00:18:10,030
This is annoying.

359
00:18:11,773 --> 00:18:14,483
I almost had it. I was close.

360
00:18:14,515 --> 00:18:15,585
You did a good job.

361
00:18:15,610 --> 00:18:16,877
You did well but...

362
00:18:17,523 --> 00:18:19,323
Hurry up and compliment me.

363
00:18:19,984 --> 00:18:23,226
Since 30 seconds is too long, do it for 20 seconds.

364
00:18:23,251 --> 00:18:24,718
It's embarrassing.

365
00:18:24,875 --> 00:18:27,075
And you run out of things to say.

366
00:18:27,125 --> 00:18:29,525
There's nothing to compliment me on?

367
00:18:29,882 --> 00:18:30,882
That's cruel.

368
00:18:32,156 --> 00:18:34,171
Talking about the appearance is too boring.

369
00:18:34,296 --> 00:18:36,335
Are you saying you've heard enough?

370
00:18:36,397 --> 00:18:39,997
- What about my personality? - There's really nothing.

371
00:18:40,718 --> 00:18:42,851
They're close enough to joke around now.

372
00:18:42,953 --> 00:18:44,718
- I'm kidding. - Okay.

373
00:18:45,070 --> 00:18:46,803
I'm looking forward to it.

374
00:18:47,062 --> 00:18:48,108
Okay, here I go.

375
00:18:48,281 --> 00:18:49,865
- I'm going to time you. - Okay.

376
00:18:49,890 --> 00:18:50,952
Get set, go.

377
00:18:51,218 --> 00:18:54,413
First, you're very handsome. You have a nice body.

378
00:18:54,546 --> 00:18:56,351
I can't do it!

379
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,952
- And... - This feels good.

380
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,460
And your tan looks very sexy.

381
00:19:03,070 --> 00:19:06,737
And you're a lot nicer than I expected from your looks.

382
00:19:07,203 --> 00:19:10,022
I'm sure there's another side to you, but you're very nice.

383
00:19:10,039 --> 00:19:11,105
And you're kind.

384
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:15,273
And you have a good personality for someone who's so handsome.

385
00:19:16,195 --> 00:19:17,262
I feel good now.

386
00:19:17,343 --> 00:19:21,647
And you're good at climbing and surfing.

387
00:19:21,672 --> 00:19:24,507
- And you're even a good student. - She's totally into him.

388
00:19:24,532 --> 00:19:26,882
Did you know that 20 seconds was up a long time ago?

389
00:19:26,913 --> 00:19:29,022
- Oh really? - You did it for longer than 30 seconds.

390
00:19:29,070 --> 00:19:31,319
- She can't look at his face at all. - She can't.

391
00:19:31,390 --> 00:19:33,116
How can she not look at him at all?

392
00:19:33,141 --> 00:19:35,382
- Yeah, how is that possible? - She likes him a lot.

393
00:19:35,429 --> 00:19:37,562
It's because she likes him a lot.

394
00:19:37,695 --> 00:19:40,295
I'll tell you that you're pretty a lot.

395
00:19:41,625 --> 00:19:45,491
Soo-bin, compliment your dad for 20 seconds. Get set, go!

396
00:19:45,539 --> 00:19:47,726
What if she cries?

397
00:19:49,359 --> 00:19:51,858
"Why are you doing this to me?"

398
00:19:52,367 --> 00:19:55,460
So where are we going next?

399
00:19:55,937 --> 00:19:58,343
We went in the water and climbed the wall.

400
00:19:58,406 --> 00:19:59,406
What's next?

401
00:19:59,546 --> 00:20:00,746
Next is the sky.

402
00:20:02,117 --> 00:20:03,383
He must be serious!

403
00:20:04,578 --> 00:20:06,844
The clip isn't just for reference?

404
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:09,694
They really went to do it?

405
00:20:10,195 --> 00:20:11,795
That looks really scary.

406
00:20:13,085 --> 00:20:14,991
I don't think I'll be able to jump.

407
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:16,140
No you can do it.

408
00:20:17,085 --> 00:20:19,538
What do you think about Joo-min? Be honest.

409
00:20:19,664 --> 00:20:24,077
He has a nice personality and has a lot of talents.

410
00:20:24,202 --> 00:20:27,538
It seems like he can take care of Soo-bin.

411
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:31,327
It's nice to see, and Soo-bin looks really happy.

412
00:20:32,148 --> 00:20:34,085
But I don't think they go well together.

413
00:20:34,148 --> 00:20:35,538
Why not?

414
00:20:35,703 --> 00:20:37,132
I don't think he likes him!

415
00:20:37,210 --> 00:20:38,476
He's jealous.

416
00:20:38,507 --> 00:20:39,866
Her dad is jealous.

417
00:20:43,835 --> 00:20:45,265
A text from the daughter's man!

418
00:20:45,290 --> 00:20:47,101
We're getting a lot of those these days.

419
00:20:47,134 --> 00:20:48,134
For real.

420
00:20:48,273 --> 00:20:49,530
What is that?

421
00:20:49,835 --> 00:20:52,538
This is what Jung Woo-sung said in a commercial.

422
00:20:52,601 --> 00:20:55,210
"Go! Leave me!" With the leaves falling.

423
00:20:55,289 --> 00:20:56,955
I think it will suit you.

424
00:20:57,906 --> 00:20:59,639
She's enjoying it too now.

425
00:20:59,851 --> 00:21:01,733
She enjoys my bad acting.

426
00:21:03,648 --> 00:21:04,648
Here I go.

427
00:21:06,164 --> 00:21:10,132
Nothing has been working out ever since I met you!

428
00:21:10,281 --> 00:21:15,507
Yo-Han is the only one who would say that directly.

429
00:21:15,585 --> 00:21:16,585
You're right.

430
00:21:16,679 --> 00:21:20,108
I think Seok-hee would've beat him if he said that to her.

431
00:21:20,133 --> 00:21:21,922
You're right.

432
00:21:22,085 --> 00:21:24,187
Didn't she learn jiu-jitsu?

433
00:21:24,663 --> 00:21:26,866
Oh yeah! She did learn it.

434
00:21:26,891 --> 00:21:30,000
Let's find out who it is through the clip!

435
00:21:33,155 --> 00:21:34,554
- What? - It's Joo-yeon.

436
00:21:34,601 --> 00:21:36,304
I never expected this.

437
00:21:36,382 --> 00:21:38,179
- All of a sudden? - I'm 33.

438
00:21:38,476 --> 00:21:39,983
- Me too. - Really?

439
00:21:40,039 --> 00:21:42,358
They must use the informal tone now.

440
00:21:42,383 --> 00:21:45,450
- Is it okay if I go to the bathroom? - Sure.

441
00:21:46,203 --> 00:21:49,147
He got up to go to the bathroom at the restaurant.

442
00:21:49,185 --> 00:21:51,185
That's how it ended last week.

443
00:21:53,724 --> 00:21:56,231
- I thought you went to the bathroom. - Yes.

444
00:21:56,263 --> 00:21:58,020
I thought you went home.

445
00:22:02,474 --> 00:22:04,005
He looks like a different person.

446
00:22:04,075 --> 00:22:07,794
This is actually my restaurant.

447
00:22:09,755 --> 00:22:10,848
He's the owner.

448
00:22:11,474 --> 00:22:13,919
We came so I can make you the food myself.

449
00:22:13,958 --> 00:22:15,262
- Really? - Yes.

450
00:22:15,841 --> 00:22:17,575
- You're going to cook? - Yes.

451
00:22:17,608 --> 00:22:19,567
Would you like to watch me cook?

452
00:22:19,654 --> 00:22:20,654
Yes.

453
00:22:21,497 --> 00:22:23,606
- He's showing her who he is. - It's a great move.

454
00:22:23,638 --> 00:22:26,341
It's an open kitchen, so you can watch me.

455
00:22:26,513 --> 00:22:27,846
- Let's go. - Okay.

456
00:22:27,965 --> 00:22:30,418
- I'm going to the kitchen? - Really? Okay.

457
00:22:32,323 --> 00:22:33,544
That's cool!

458
00:22:33,569 --> 00:22:36,052
- I'll get you a glass of white wine. - Nice.

459
00:22:36,130 --> 00:22:38,770
And I'll make you a welcome dish.

460
00:22:39,208 --> 00:22:42,542
She'll have a glass of wine and wait for her food.

461
00:22:42,622 --> 00:22:46,778
Guys look the best when they're working.

462
00:22:46,958 --> 00:22:49,492
I don't think she can drink that much.

463
00:22:51,755 --> 00:22:53,955
Please give me a plate for salad.

464
00:22:56,356 --> 00:22:57,919
- Do you like it? - It's good.

465
00:22:57,997 --> 00:22:59,131
It's really good.

466
00:22:59,325 --> 00:23:01,392
I was only going to have a sip.

467
00:23:01,599 --> 00:23:04,442
I hope you don't get drunk. You said your face gets red.

468
00:23:04,490 --> 00:23:05,490
He's sweet.

469
00:23:05,982 --> 00:23:09,208
- Please pace yourself. - Okay.

470
00:23:12,677 --> 00:23:15,661
This is an appetizer that people eat in Spain.

471
00:23:17,419 --> 00:23:19,708
This is called pan con tomate.

472
00:23:19,733 --> 00:23:21,000
What's that on top?

473
00:23:21,013 --> 00:23:23,458
- It's tomato salsa. - That sounds good!

474
00:23:23,817 --> 00:23:27,028
And this is Italian reggiano cheese.

475
00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:30,387
This makes him look more mature even though they're the same age.

476
00:23:30,404 --> 00:23:32,684
You can eat it in small bites.

477
00:23:32,966 --> 00:23:35,481
I'll make the salad now. Please shake it.

478
00:23:37,434 --> 00:23:38,583
This is really good.

479
00:23:38,677 --> 00:23:41,747
The gentleness is spreading on his face.

480
00:23:41,772 --> 00:23:44,497
- The guy? - Look at Jae-young.

481
00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:46,700
He's totally into it.

482
00:23:49,005 --> 00:23:50,473
Do you like avocados?

483
00:23:50,637 --> 00:23:51,950
I love them.

484
00:23:52,886 --> 00:23:54,247
She's acting cute.

485
00:23:59,473 --> 00:24:00,653
This won't do.

486
00:24:06,365 --> 00:24:09,466
- She's showing off her charm! - Showing her neck!

487
00:24:09,950 --> 00:24:12,966
What does it mean when the girl reveals her neck?

488
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:16,637
It's like showing your delicate side.

489
00:24:16,732 --> 00:24:19,465
It's like this. You stay like this and...

490
00:24:20,513 --> 00:24:23,887
do this all of a sudden and tie your hair.

491
00:24:23,912 --> 00:24:26,645
There's no need for So-Jin to reenact it.

492
00:24:28,193 --> 00:24:31,169
You're making So-Jin really comfortable.

493
00:24:34,013 --> 00:24:37,427
We're going to eat together at the table when I'm done.

494
00:24:37,466 --> 00:24:41,419
I didn't want you to be bored while you were watching so I got you the wine.

495
00:24:41,513 --> 00:24:43,700
Joo-yeon looks cooler with her hair up.

496
00:24:43,725 --> 00:24:45,349
I used to do that too once.

497
00:24:45,374 --> 00:24:47,387
- Putting your hair up? - Yes.

498
00:24:47,466 --> 00:24:49,799
I've prepared you the welcome dish.

499
00:24:51,435 --> 00:24:54,169
Guys like it when girls tie their hair like that.

500
00:24:54,286 --> 00:24:57,997
- This is the herring egg, caviar. - I know.

501
00:24:58,091 --> 00:24:59,669
I've seen it before.

502
00:24:59,841 --> 00:25:01,512
She must be happy.

503
00:25:02,224 --> 00:25:03,224
Caviar.

504
00:25:03,685 --> 00:25:06,152
This is Spanish style salted octopus.

505
00:25:06,638 --> 00:25:07,638
I love octopus.

506
00:25:08,887 --> 00:25:11,036
He's making all of the dishes like that?

507
00:25:11,115 --> 00:25:13,809
It's because you eat the food with your eyes.

508
00:25:13,997 --> 00:25:15,797
He has a good sense of art.

509
00:25:17,638 --> 00:25:20,223
- He's good at explaining. - That's pretty!

510
00:25:20,255 --> 00:25:21,981
That looks good!

511
00:25:23,036 --> 00:25:26,466
He looked a little cold earlier, but he looks very gentle when he cooks.

512
00:25:26,491 --> 00:25:29,084
- His cold image disappeared. - Yeah.

513
00:25:29,154 --> 00:25:33,934
He's being so sweet. I wonder how the text came about?

514
00:25:34,005 --> 00:25:36,405
- What did it mean? - I don't know.

515
00:25:36,911 --> 00:25:39,341
- I'm going to face the back for a bit. - See?

516
00:25:39,466 --> 00:25:40,999
He's being considerate.

517
00:25:41,474 --> 00:25:42,778
He's caring.

518
00:25:42,857 --> 00:25:45,434
- Just to let you know. - Okay.

519
00:25:45,591 --> 00:25:48,591
I thought you were telling me to turn around.

520
00:25:49,154 --> 00:25:50,387
Do you like meat?

521
00:25:50,528 --> 00:25:51,528
Yes I do.

522
00:25:51,607 --> 00:25:53,637
- Do you like pork neck? - Yes.

523
00:25:53,669 --> 00:25:56,606
This is Iberico black pork steak.

524
00:25:56,785 --> 00:25:58,919
That's really popular these days.

525
00:25:58,943 --> 00:26:02,098
- It's Spanish pork. - Black pork who grazed.

526
00:26:02,130 --> 00:26:03,130
Right.

527
00:26:03,155 --> 00:26:06,584
- Where's your nose meat from? - It's like the fish ice cream.

528
00:26:10,364 --> 00:26:11,964
The meat is really thin.

529
00:26:17,755 --> 00:26:20,355
Wow, they're going to eat together now.

530
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:24,012
I think I'd feel bad eating something like that.

531
00:26:24,037 --> 00:26:25,770
The pork neck sounds good.

532
00:26:25,795 --> 00:26:28,700
- It looks so pretty! - That looks good.

533
00:26:28,849 --> 00:26:32,637
The fact that a chef showed himself cooking

534
00:26:32,662 --> 00:26:35,395
- means he showed off his best charm. - That's right.

535
00:26:35,435 --> 00:26:40,997
People fall for singers when they sing on stage.

536
00:26:41,607 --> 00:26:43,747
What about you Soo-geun?

537
00:26:44,130 --> 00:26:46,028
Do you crack jokes in front of girls?

538
00:26:46,053 --> 00:26:47,895
It was when I was doing "No High Note."

539
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:51,120
- How? - I lowered my voice and said, "Hello."

540
00:26:53,216 --> 00:26:56,816
It's because people don't recognize me without my wig.

541
00:26:56,841 --> 00:26:58,403
So I had to give them my voice.

542
00:26:58,497 --> 00:27:01,614
I used to take girls to karaoke and sing.

543
00:27:03,325 --> 00:27:06,528
Why are you even singing like Choi Min-soo now?

544
00:27:09,310 --> 00:27:11,106
- Shall we eat? - Yes.

545
00:27:11,185 --> 00:27:13,223
- What should I start with? - Start with the salad.

546
00:27:13,248 --> 00:27:15,248
Let me put some on your plate.

547
00:27:16,661 --> 00:27:17,856
How cute.

548
00:27:18,341 --> 00:27:21,192
His attitude has changed.

549
00:27:21,583 --> 00:27:23,950
He's gotten a lot softer.

550
00:27:26,052 --> 00:27:27,653
This is really good.

551
00:27:27,825 --> 00:27:29,225
- Is it okay? - Yes.

552
00:27:29,482 --> 00:27:30,739
That's good.

553
00:27:33,099 --> 00:27:34,432
You know how to eat.

554
00:27:34,990 --> 00:27:36,656
I like girls who can eat.

555
00:27:36,732 --> 00:27:38,398
That was out of the blue.

556
00:27:39,607 --> 00:27:41,207
Don't you like to eat?

557
00:27:41,591 --> 00:27:43,497
Me? Yes, I do.

558
00:27:43,997 --> 00:27:45,536
But I can't eat a lot.

559
00:27:47,380 --> 00:27:49,914
My digestion abilities have decreased.

560
00:27:50,458 --> 00:27:52,392
Stop talking about sad stuff.

561
00:27:53,138 --> 00:27:55,419
I'm at the age where I have to admit it.

562
00:27:55,482 --> 00:27:56,482
No you're not.

563
00:28:00,005 --> 00:28:02,489
I personally want to try that pork neck.

564
00:28:02,599 --> 00:28:04,532
Kyung-hoon, make some for me.

565
00:28:07,271 --> 00:28:08,737
She's falling for him.

566
00:28:09,115 --> 00:28:10,115
She can eat.

567
00:28:13,677 --> 00:28:18,302
I've never seen Joo-yeon eat that much.

568
00:28:19,153 --> 00:28:20,356
You're right.

569
00:28:21,404 --> 00:28:23,716
How do you feel after meeting me?

570
00:28:26,490 --> 00:28:29,169
- Compliment him! - She should give him a score.

571
00:28:29,802 --> 00:28:32,731
From when we first saw each other...

572
00:28:32,935 --> 00:28:35,135
Do you feel more comfortable now?

573
00:28:35,177 --> 00:28:36,177
I guess not.

574
00:28:38,021 --> 00:28:39,255
Do you feel comfortable?

575
00:28:39,271 --> 00:28:45,973
It was a little awkward since we didn't get to talk much.

576
00:28:46,044 --> 00:28:47,653
It hasn't been that long since we've met.

577
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:48,700
He's not fake.

578
00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:52,208
I feel more comfortable because I've shown you who I really am.

579
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:55,903
- After you've seen me cook in my space... - Right.

580
00:28:56,161 --> 00:28:58,458
So I feel more comfortable now.

581
00:28:59,997 --> 00:29:08,575
I've written down my thoughts and emotions that I felt after meeting you today.

582
00:29:09,309 --> 00:29:10,520
He's romantic.

583
00:29:10,599 --> 00:29:12,356
Wow, people still do that these days?

584
00:29:12,466 --> 00:29:13,708
That's touching.

585
00:29:15,887 --> 00:29:16,958
"Joo-yeon."

586
00:29:17,450 --> 00:29:19,917
Why do you always want to act it out?

587
00:29:19,997 --> 00:29:21,052
Just read it!

588
00:29:21,138 --> 00:29:22,442
Why am I nervous?

589
00:29:22,802 --> 00:29:25,309
Joo-yeon, it was very nice meeting you today.

590
00:29:25,443 --> 00:29:30,802
Can I see you again where we can be more ourselves next time?

591
00:29:31,247 --> 00:29:33,098
Be more themselves?

592
00:29:33,974 --> 00:29:36,374
Somewhere uplifting and comfortable.

593
00:29:37,521 --> 00:29:41,489
Most people just say it out loud, but writing it down is new.

594
00:29:41,514 --> 00:29:43,536
It's something people used to do long time ago.

595
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:47,395
I really like this guy.

596
00:29:50,294 --> 00:29:52,020
"Can I see you again?"

597
00:30:03,841 --> 00:30:08,067
Doesn't that feel better than an actual "Yes?" Signing it with your body.

598
00:30:08,092 --> 00:30:09,770
- Right? - We like it too.

599
00:30:09,818 --> 00:30:12,473
My heart skipped a beat when they nodded.

600
00:30:14,489 --> 00:30:17,841
Yes, we can meet again.

601
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:21,747
The food was very delicious.

602
00:30:22,044 --> 00:30:24,817
- I had a lot of fun. - Me too.

603
00:30:24,848 --> 00:30:27,833
Thank you for allowing me to cook for you.

604
00:30:28,091 --> 00:30:29,891
Although it was a surprise.

605
00:30:31,302 --> 00:30:32,635
I really enjoyed it.

606
00:30:32,685 --> 00:30:34,885
I'm happy because you enjoyed it.

607
00:30:37,231 --> 00:30:41,223
Joo-yeon's ideal type was her dad.

608
00:30:41,318 --> 00:30:43,802
I think he has a lot of similarities with her dad.

609
00:30:43,958 --> 00:30:45,934
- He's calm. - He's sweet.

610
00:30:46,083 --> 00:30:49,052
I think he has a very similar vibe with you.

611
00:30:49,115 --> 00:30:51,364
We'll have to see. I'm not sure yet.

612
00:30:51,466 --> 00:30:54,066
He might get talkative all of a sudden.

613
00:31:16,825 --> 00:31:18,425
He took off his glasses!

614
00:31:18,458 --> 00:31:19,505
You're right!

615
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:22,778
- Joo-yeon. - He looks like a man of autumn.

616
00:31:28,012 --> 00:31:30,546
- Have you been waiting for a long time? - No.

617
00:31:31,036 --> 00:31:33,170
I haven't been waiting for long.

618
00:31:33,895 --> 00:31:35,106
Aren't you cold?

619
00:31:35,161 --> 00:31:37,739
- I put on a lot of layers. - You're dressed very warm.

620
00:31:37,849 --> 00:31:39,200
It was raining in the morning.

621
00:31:39,225 --> 00:31:41,239
There's a lot of butterflies going on.

622
00:31:41,255 --> 00:31:43,325
This is making me feel very weird.

623
00:31:43,505 --> 00:31:45,905
The background is really pretty too.

624
00:31:47,794 --> 00:31:48,794
I'm okay.

625
00:31:48,911 --> 00:31:50,934
We were at a very crowded place last time.

626
00:31:51,029 --> 00:31:53,356
I guess he wanted to see her somewhere quiet.

627
00:31:53,442 --> 00:31:55,380
We came to a place with not a lot of people.

628
00:31:55,405 --> 00:31:57,202
It's very nice. The air is nice too.

629
00:32:02,122 --> 00:32:03,864
It's pretty.

630
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:09,270
That will make anyone want to go on a date.

631
00:32:09,302 --> 00:32:10,302
Seriously.

632
00:32:11,763 --> 00:32:15,395
- In person, it's... - It's awesome.

633
00:32:15,505 --> 00:32:18,169
- Taking a picture with the flowers... - I think it will turn out nice.

634
00:32:18,194 --> 00:32:20,278
- Should we go down and take a picture? - Yes.

635
00:32:20,303 --> 00:32:22,622
Could you take a picture for us?

636
00:32:22,661 --> 00:32:23,661
Sure.

637
00:32:24,099 --> 00:32:25,637
We should step back.

638
00:32:25,708 --> 00:32:28,067
- Get close. - Close?

639
00:32:28,302 --> 00:32:30,102
We're very close right now.

640
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:33,006
The lady is very...

641
00:32:33,138 --> 00:32:36,395
They do that a lot when you ask them to take a picture for you.

642
00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:39,302
- Put your hand on her shoulder. - I think he's going to do it right away.

643
00:32:39,365 --> 00:32:41,458
Isn't he going to do this? Hover over?

644
00:32:41,483 --> 00:32:44,100
This is great. Let's see what he does.

645
00:32:44,350 --> 00:32:47,834
Put your hand on her shoulder.

646
00:32:53,256 --> 00:32:54,881
You put in a lot of time on your hair.

647
00:32:54,906 --> 00:32:57,100
- They're setting Yeon-ji up? - A double date?

648
00:32:57,155 --> 00:32:58,155
I usually do.

649
00:32:58,180 --> 00:33:01,053
You're majoring in English. He's really good!

650
00:33:01,366 --> 00:33:03,084
He always got first place.

651
00:33:05,256 --> 00:33:06,709
That must be fun.

652
00:33:10,256 --> 00:33:13,858
Put your hand on her shoulder.

653
00:33:24,084 --> 00:33:27,623
Hold on. One, two, three.

654
00:33:30,475 --> 00:33:34,100
- They look good together. - They do look a little awkward.

655
00:33:35,365 --> 00:33:37,100
You have to do it on the comfortable side.

656
00:33:37,125 --> 00:33:39,022
- This is good right? - Yes.

657
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:41,256
- You press this button. - Okay.

658
00:33:41,281 --> 00:33:42,281
Got it?

659
00:33:42,288 --> 00:33:44,421
Should I take it without saying?

660
00:33:48,671 --> 00:33:52,326
They look like a married couple from the 70s.

661
00:33:52,366 --> 00:33:54,350
Yeah, it looks like a newlywed photo.

662
00:33:54,405 --> 00:33:55,805
It feels really good.

663
00:33:57,749 --> 00:34:01,108
To be honest, I don't really take selfies.

664
00:34:01,967 --> 00:34:03,701
- I've never used this before. - Really?

665
00:34:03,717 --> 00:34:05,051
Yes, a selfie stick.

666
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:08,592
- This used to be really popular. - Yeah.

667
00:34:09,397 --> 00:34:10,873
I turned it on...

668
00:34:11,631 --> 00:34:12,615
This is nice.

669
00:34:22,741 --> 00:34:25,341
I took a year's worth of selfies today.

670
00:34:25,366 --> 00:34:26,366
Really?

671
00:34:26,391 --> 00:34:28,225
This could be two years' worth.

672
00:34:28,256 --> 00:34:29,990
- Really? - I took a lot.

673
00:34:30,015 --> 00:34:32,365
What about taking pictures for other people?

674
00:34:32,452 --> 00:34:33,785
I do a lot of those.

675
00:34:34,256 --> 00:34:36,256
They're starting to talk more.

676
00:34:37,171 --> 00:34:38,897
What a nice view.

677
00:34:39,147 --> 00:34:40,209
It's so pretty.

678
00:34:40,319 --> 00:34:42,342
The air is amazing there.

679
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:46,147
It's refreshing just to look at it.

680
00:34:46,546 --> 00:34:50,012
We need to go to places like that from time to time.

681
00:34:55,717 --> 00:34:56,975
This is pretty.

682
00:34:57,077 --> 00:35:00,210
We should've came before the leaves had fallen.

683
00:35:00,235 --> 00:35:01,968
A lot of them have fallen.

684
00:35:02,318 --> 00:35:04,428
That's why it looks prettier.

685
00:35:05,366 --> 00:35:10,326
- If you catch a falling leaf.... - A small one, right?

686
00:35:10,358 --> 00:35:12,358
they say your wish comes true.

687
00:35:12,405 --> 00:35:15,537
He's surprisingly into shamanism. He believe in superstitions.

688
00:35:16,311 --> 00:35:17,975
What the heck? Shamanism?

689
00:35:18,022 --> 00:35:19,772
I haven't heard that word in a long time.

690
00:35:19,850 --> 00:35:20,850
Shamanism...

691
00:35:21,412 --> 00:35:23,162
Have you ever caught one? No, right?

692
00:35:23,241 --> 00:35:24,241
I haven't.

693
00:35:24,842 --> 00:35:25,842
Me neither...

694
00:35:26,631 --> 00:35:30,756
People used to catch them and use them as bookmarks.

695
00:35:31,647 --> 00:35:33,975
- Did you know that? - No.

696
00:35:34,803 --> 00:35:35,803
Just kidding.

697
00:35:36,163 --> 00:35:39,943
I wanted to catch one but there isn't any falling.

698
00:35:40,874 --> 00:35:42,274
Do you remember that?

699
00:35:42,389 --> 00:35:47,358
When Jung Woo-sung from the drink commercial from a long time ago...

700
00:35:48,624 --> 00:35:52,717
- "When you're lacking something..." - That's where the text is from.

701
00:35:52,780 --> 00:35:53,983
Of course.

702
00:35:54,108 --> 00:35:57,225
- Do you remember him throwing the leaves? - He was angry.

703
00:35:57,250 --> 00:36:02,287
Nothing has been working out since I met you! Go away!

704
00:36:03,655 --> 00:36:06,584
But I can't throw leaves at you.

705
00:36:06,889 --> 00:36:07,889
No, you can.

706
00:36:07,998 --> 00:36:09,132
- Really? - Yes.

707
00:36:09,296 --> 00:36:12,701
You can do exactly what Jung Woo-sung did.

708
00:36:12,764 --> 00:36:13,764
Okay.

709
00:36:15,725 --> 00:36:18,076
- What happened? - He must've grabbed a handful.

710
00:36:18,147 --> 00:36:19,147
Okay.

711
00:36:20,577 --> 00:36:23,110
You know he had a serious face, right?

712
00:36:23,608 --> 00:36:30,233
I'll become Jung Woo-sung today.

713
00:36:30,374 --> 00:36:31,623
Here he goes.

714
00:36:34,296 --> 00:36:37,522
Nothing has been working out since I met you.

715
00:36:37,936 --> 00:36:38,936
Go away.

716
00:36:42,053 --> 00:36:43,287
I said, go away.

717
00:36:43,615 --> 00:36:46,022
I don't think he'll be able to toss the leaves in her face though.

718
00:36:46,047 --> 00:36:47,380
But she told him to.

719
00:36:47,405 --> 00:36:48,872
Where did he throw it?

720
00:36:48,889 --> 00:36:49,889
Go away.

721
00:36:51,944 --> 00:36:54,411
- He's a gentleman. - He's romantic.

722
00:36:54,452 --> 00:36:55,772
He's sensible.

723
00:37:00,030 --> 00:37:01,030
What?

724
00:37:02,131 --> 00:37:03,506
What was that?

725
00:37:03,756 --> 00:37:05,670
Are you sure that was it?

726
00:37:07,131 --> 00:37:09,865
Kyung-hoon is surprisingly good at acting.

727
00:37:09,975 --> 00:37:11,309
He's better than me.

728
00:37:12,788 --> 00:37:16,303
It looks like the two have gotten more comfortable with each other.

729
00:37:16,397 --> 00:37:18,740
- Yes. - They're joking around.

730
00:37:18,772 --> 00:37:20,772
Joo-yeon usually don't suggest doing stuff

731
00:37:20,797 --> 00:37:22,889
like that. It's because she feels comfortable.

732
00:37:22,914 --> 00:37:25,818
- It means the two have connected. - That's right.

733
00:37:26,335 --> 00:37:28,668
You got home safe that night right?

734
00:37:28,827 --> 00:37:29,827
Yes.

735
00:37:30,108 --> 00:37:32,241
- Did you get home safe? - Yes.

736
00:37:32,405 --> 00:37:36,490
It's less awkward since it's our second time meeting.

737
00:37:36,624 --> 00:37:37,600
Right?

738
00:37:37,701 --> 00:37:39,501
- It's good, right? - Yes.

739
00:37:39,678 --> 00:37:40,946
It's not awkward, right?

740
00:37:40,971 --> 00:37:43,506
No. It wasn't too awkward that day either.

741
00:37:43,531 --> 00:37:44,531
Really?

742
00:37:44,553 --> 00:37:46,608
I was just pretending to be serious.

743
00:37:46,638 --> 00:37:50,170
- He has a jokester side to him. - He does.

744
00:37:50,226 --> 00:37:52,209
- You're not a serious guy? - No. I joke around a lot.

745
00:37:52,234 --> 00:37:54,256
Then why were you pretending to be serious?

746
00:37:54,288 --> 00:37:57,881
I can't be a jokester from the beginning.

747
00:37:59,272 --> 00:38:00,272
I'm old.

748
00:38:01,256 --> 00:38:02,014
Right?

749
00:38:02,039 --> 00:38:03,777
It's not fun if he's serious all the time.

750
00:38:03,810 --> 00:38:06,623
He has a sweet voice. He really sounds like Sung Si-kyung.

751
00:38:06,687 --> 00:38:10,287
- What did you think of the food? - It was delicious.

752
00:38:10,538 --> 00:38:12,248
It stayed on my mind.

753
00:38:13,381 --> 00:38:17,787
There's a spice that you can't see when you cook.

754
00:38:17,874 --> 00:38:20,615
It's the emotion of the chef.

755
00:38:23,178 --> 00:38:30,850
If he adds the thought of wanting the person to really enjoy the food,

756
00:38:31,553 --> 00:38:34,006
it gets relayed to the person for real.

757
00:38:35,038 --> 00:38:37,287
- Isn't he a generator of wise sayings? - Yes.

758
00:38:37,312 --> 00:38:39,712
He's almost on Kang Ho-dong's level.

759
00:38:40,952 --> 00:38:45,552
Even when you cook something with the same recipe and same technique,

760
00:38:46,499 --> 00:38:53,498
whether you add that emotion or not influences how the food affects the person.

761
00:38:54,952 --> 00:38:56,654
Those things are fun.

762
00:38:56,889 --> 00:38:59,647
That's why your mother's cooking is delicious.

763
00:38:59,678 --> 00:39:06,537
They're the same age. And technically he's 3 months younger than her.

764
00:39:06,678 --> 00:39:09,865
But he feels older than her.

765
00:39:09,944 --> 00:39:10,990
A lot older.

766
00:39:11,061 --> 00:39:15,584
And I don't think Joo-yeon wants to use the informal tone with him.

767
00:39:15,653 --> 00:39:18,575
- She wants to lean on him more. - Because he's mature.

768
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:19,826
It's natural.

769
00:39:21,921 --> 00:39:23,623
Where's that place?

770
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:26,006
A crafting experience?

771
00:39:26,069 --> 00:39:29,002
I guess it's an experience hall at the park.

772
00:39:31,147 --> 00:39:32,600
There's a place like that?

773
00:39:32,624 --> 00:39:34,024
What are they making?

774
00:39:37,178 --> 00:39:40,287
- Where should we sit? - You guys can sit right there.

775
00:39:40,405 --> 00:39:44,115
You have to put on your aprons before we start.

776
00:39:44,335 --> 00:39:46,686
You can help each other.

777
00:39:46,967 --> 00:39:49,234
- Oh you put in your head. - Yes.

778
00:39:49,756 --> 00:39:51,818
You're not going to do something funny, right?

779
00:39:51,874 --> 00:39:53,340
"Come here, Joo-yeon."

780
00:39:55,327 --> 00:39:57,850
- Turn around. - He's caring!

781
00:40:00,553 --> 00:40:03,100
I've never put on an apron before.

782
00:40:04,912 --> 00:40:06,112
Do I tie it tight?

783
00:40:06,796 --> 00:40:10,256
It's funny when you tie it to yourself.

784
00:40:10,296 --> 00:40:13,342
- So you're tied together? - You get dragged along.

785
00:40:13,436 --> 00:40:14,803
A couple's apron.

786
00:40:16,327 --> 00:40:19,029
You can take a seat. I'll help you with the materials.

787
00:40:19,124 --> 00:40:24,123
You're going to make troll friends that look like this.

788
00:40:24,366 --> 00:40:27,522
A lot of the couples make it too.

789
00:40:27,764 --> 00:40:31,818
What's your status?

790
00:40:32,069 --> 00:40:33,402
What's their status?

791
00:40:33,780 --> 00:40:34,780
We're...

792
00:40:38,967 --> 00:40:40,084
We're...

793
00:40:44,162 --> 00:40:45,834
What the heck!

794
00:40:46,710 --> 00:40:48,014
This isn't fair!

795
00:40:48,039 --> 00:40:50,803
This one ended faster than last week's right?

796
00:40:50,881 --> 00:40:54,350
You must've been very upset to do this.

797
00:40:54,702 --> 00:40:58,193
People have their expectations. I didn't know they'd end it here.

798
00:40:58,311 --> 00:41:00,178
They did that last week too.

799
00:41:00,397 --> 00:41:02,561
He said "We're..."

800
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:08,803
Why do you sing like that?

801
00:41:11,936 --> 00:41:13,858
What do you think he said?

802
00:41:14,514 --> 00:41:15,514
I'm not sure.

803
00:41:15,585 --> 00:41:18,397
"We're getting to know each other more."

804
00:41:18,422 --> 00:41:20,222
Yes, getting to know each other.

805
00:41:20,272 --> 00:41:22,904
I think he said something in Spanish.

806
00:41:26,296 --> 00:41:28,092
Oh yeah! In Spanish!

807
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:31,428
Anyway, we'll have to keep watching.

808
00:41:31,453 --> 00:41:33,334
We'll find out next week.

809
00:41:39,131 --> 00:41:40,217
That's crazy!

810
00:41:40,763 --> 00:41:42,256
Hee-chul loves this.

811
00:41:42,678 --> 00:41:46,522
- This is crazy! - Viewers, please hold on to your seats.

812
00:41:47,397 --> 00:41:50,123
Do you want me to bathe you?

813
00:41:51,319 --> 00:41:53,584
Do you want to get slapped by my dad?

814
00:41:53,694 --> 00:41:55,295
It's Seok-hee.

815
00:41:55,397 --> 00:41:56,709
Yo-Han said that?

816
00:41:56,734 --> 00:42:00,123
It can't be Seok-hee. She would've just slapped him.

817
00:42:00,662 --> 00:42:01,803
That's true!

818
00:42:01,952 --> 00:42:03,115
Let's see.

819
00:42:09,171 --> 00:42:11,506
- Where is this place? - Where is that?

820
00:42:13,264 --> 00:42:15,248
- It's Seok-hee. - I told you it's Seok-hee.

821
00:42:15,273 --> 00:42:16,811
Yo-Han said something like that?

822
00:42:16,835 --> 00:42:19,768
I'm sorry but why is Seok-hee always eating?

823
00:42:21,036 --> 00:42:23,436
- That's what I'm saying! - Right?

824
00:42:26,952 --> 00:42:29,752
She did the hair style in trend right now.

825
00:42:31,163 --> 00:42:32,163
Where are you?

826
00:42:33,006 --> 00:42:34,545
Hurry up. I'm hungry.

827
00:42:34,570 --> 00:42:35,943
She said, "Hurry up, I'm hungry."

828
00:42:35,968 --> 00:42:39,035
Why are you hungry when you're already eating?

829
00:42:46,413 --> 00:42:47,879
It must be her friend.

830
00:42:48,147 --> 00:42:50,358
- Isn't it one of her friends? - Ji-seul?

831
00:42:50,428 --> 00:42:52,095
It's either Ji-seul or...

832
00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:53,719
It's someone younger.

833
00:42:53,811 --> 00:42:54,928
Yeon-ji?

834
00:42:55,452 --> 00:42:57,295
- Yeon-ji! - It's Yeon-ji.

835
00:42:58,115 --> 00:42:59,475
That's crazy!

836
00:43:05,342 --> 00:43:07,397
I'm so hungry. I'm going to have some of this.

837
00:43:07,436 --> 00:43:08,436
Me too.

838
00:43:10,350 --> 00:43:11,818
They're really close.

839
00:43:11,975 --> 00:43:13,459
They're super close.

840
00:43:18,085 --> 00:43:19,545
Now I feel bad.

841
00:43:24,427 --> 00:43:27,397
- It's good if they eat a lot. - They're so cute!

842
00:43:28,084 --> 00:43:29,810
Have you watched the show?

843
00:43:29,842 --> 00:43:31,109
- The show? - Yes.

844
00:43:31,428 --> 00:43:33,428
I was going to watch it since you're on it, but

845
00:43:33,453 --> 00:43:36,358
you know I live by myself and don't have a TV.

846
00:43:36,383 --> 00:43:38,092
So it's hard for me to watch it.

847
00:43:38,117 --> 00:43:40,506
- How long has it been? - Seriously. How long has it been?

848
00:43:40,538 --> 00:43:42,248
We had our 100 days celebration last week.

849
00:43:42,273 --> 00:43:44,279
- Already? - Yo-Han did something for you, huh?

850
00:43:44,319 --> 00:43:45,319
A letter.

851
00:43:47,155 --> 00:43:49,514
- He bought me something. - What?

852
00:43:50,030 --> 00:43:51,030
Something.

853
00:43:51,061 --> 00:43:53,233
- He bought you jewelry huh? - Yes.

854
00:43:53,258 --> 00:43:55,014
He bought her jewelry.

855
00:43:55,085 --> 00:43:58,693
You know the whole country knows you guys are dating.

856
00:43:59,100 --> 00:44:02,029
How is it dating in the open?

857
00:44:02,311 --> 00:44:03,311
For real.

858
00:44:03,319 --> 00:44:06,068
It's uncomfortable and burdening.

859
00:44:07,171 --> 00:44:08,451
Stressful.

860
00:44:09,405 --> 00:44:11,693
It's like everyone's in the relationship together.

861
00:44:11,733 --> 00:44:13,959
- The whole country is in it? - Yes.

862
00:44:13,999 --> 00:44:14,999
She's right.

863
00:44:15,436 --> 00:44:16,436
I bet.

864
00:44:16,483 --> 00:44:22,709
People who date in the open always say it's not just them two dating.

865
00:44:22,927 --> 00:44:24,936
There are a lot of things you have to worry about.

866
00:44:24,983 --> 00:44:27,092
- Did you know about that? - I didn't.

867
00:44:27,155 --> 00:44:28,123
But I bet so.

868
00:44:28,264 --> 00:44:29,597
It can be stressful.

869
00:44:29,655 --> 00:44:32,717
It can be hard to handle at that young age.

870
00:44:32,858 --> 00:44:36,420
Yes, it's hard to enjoy it, and it's their first time.

871
00:44:38,046 --> 00:44:39,046
Seok-hee.

872
00:44:40,272 --> 00:44:41,872
Wow, Yo-Han is really...

873
00:44:44,303 --> 00:44:46,998
What? Are they setting Yeon-ji up on a date?

874
00:44:47,131 --> 00:44:48,358
A double date?

875
00:44:51,373 --> 00:44:53,256
Kwang-gi would've been like, "No, no."

876
00:44:53,342 --> 00:44:55,936
He would've said, "Yeon-ji, no, no."

877
00:44:58,201 --> 00:44:59,436
He's handsome.

878
00:44:59,733 --> 00:45:01,466
I've met you before right?

879
00:45:02,811 --> 00:45:04,144
- We've met. - Yes.

880
00:45:04,413 --> 00:45:05,858
- What? - They've met before.

881
00:45:05,881 --> 00:45:08,154
- They've all met before. - Really?

882
00:45:08,397 --> 00:45:12,147
He was there when we were drinking with Yo-Han.

883
00:45:16,749 --> 00:45:18,764
You put a lot of time in your hair today.

884
00:45:18,858 --> 00:45:20,592
I usually do.

885
00:45:23,577 --> 00:45:25,709
Oh, they're all close with each other.

886
00:45:25,866 --> 00:45:30,162
Guys usually don't have blankets over them no matter how cold it is.

887
00:45:30,624 --> 00:45:32,553
It's because he's weak.

888
00:45:33,155 --> 00:45:35,100
Isn't that hypothermia?

889
00:45:35,983 --> 00:45:37,783
You're majoring in English.

890
00:45:37,811 --> 00:45:38,811
You are?

891
00:45:38,999 --> 00:45:41,045
- Yes. - He's very good at English.

892
00:45:41,069 --> 00:45:42,802
He always got first place.

893
00:45:44,702 --> 00:45:46,835
He lived abroad for a long time.

894
00:45:48,647 --> 00:45:51,717
- He has the second generation vibe. - Yes.

895
00:45:52,905 --> 00:45:54,572
There's no more sandwich?

896
00:45:54,624 --> 00:45:56,389
Should we order more?

897
00:45:57,780 --> 00:45:58,780
I want more.

898
00:45:58,858 --> 00:46:01,037
She never does this with me.

899
00:46:02,139 --> 00:46:03,939
She shares a straw with me.

900
00:46:04,913 --> 00:46:07,436
I want to do that too.

901
00:46:07,631 --> 00:46:09,670
Are you guys going to eat anything?

902
00:46:09,702 --> 00:46:11,553
I'm hungry. Should we order something?

903
00:46:11,578 --> 00:46:13,561
- Do you want some sandwich? - Yes.

904
00:46:13,577 --> 00:46:15,248
I think you're the one who wants some.

905
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:16,747
- No... - Yes you do.

906
00:46:16,796 --> 00:46:17,796
She does.

907
00:46:18,740 --> 00:46:20,215
Her eyes were shaking.

908
00:46:28,530 --> 00:46:31,834
Seok-hee gets shy when there's someone else there.

909
00:46:33,592 --> 00:46:35,654
Isn't she adorable?

910
00:46:43,467 --> 00:46:44,701
Eat.

911
00:46:45,975 --> 00:46:47,365
Eat one.

912
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:49,960
Say ah.

913
00:46:51,506 --> 00:46:53,779
You eat it. I think I can fit the whole thing in my mouth.

914
00:46:53,796 --> 00:46:54,553
Try it.

915
00:46:54,578 --> 00:46:57,194
- I think I can fit it in my mouth. - Don't do it.

916
00:47:02,419 --> 00:47:05,084
- For real? - He made it look so unappetizing.

917
00:47:05,732 --> 00:47:08,732
Are you sure your mouth doesn't have a hole?

918
00:47:18,006 --> 00:47:20,498
- Yo-Han is adorable. - Yo-Han is very cute.

919
00:47:20,577 --> 00:47:22,377
Does Yo-Han treat you well?

920
00:47:23,514 --> 00:47:24,514
Sure...

921
00:47:28,053 --> 00:47:29,253
He treats me well.

922
00:47:29,889 --> 00:47:31,178
I need to try more.

923
00:47:31,203 --> 00:47:33,029
You should be thankful that she's dating you.

924
00:47:33,054 --> 00:47:35,045
- Yeah, Seok-hee is the best. - That was out of the blue.

925
00:47:35,077 --> 00:47:37,373
I think you made a mistake bringing your friend.

926
00:47:37,398 --> 00:47:39,623
One thing is for sure. No one is on my side here.

927
00:47:39,663 --> 00:47:42,514
You need a friend like that who says the right things.

928
00:47:42,539 --> 00:47:44,717
"You should be thankful that she's dating you."

929
00:47:44,780 --> 00:47:47,733
- If he were on Yo-han's side... - Yeah.

930
00:47:48,194 --> 00:47:49,967
That's why they're best friends.

931
00:47:49,992 --> 00:47:52,248
Why did you call us here so early in the morning?

932
00:47:52,273 --> 00:47:54,295
We said we'd do something I want to do this time.

933
00:47:54,319 --> 00:47:55,584
- What is it? - Oh yeah.

934
00:47:55,609 --> 00:47:57,342
- What are they dating? - What is it?

935
00:47:57,382 --> 00:47:58,382
A double date.

936
00:47:58,561 --> 00:48:00,709
Why did you call us here on your date?

937
00:48:01,601 --> 00:48:03,265
We're all going to chill together.

938
00:48:03,343 --> 00:48:05,944
- We're going to chill, right? - We're going to enjoy it together.

939
00:48:05,969 --> 00:48:06,765
Enjoy it?

940
00:48:06,790 --> 00:48:08,210
Is it something I'll enjoy too?

941
00:48:08,235 --> 00:48:09,546
What does she want to do?

942
00:48:09,562 --> 00:48:11,062
Something to do together?

943
00:48:11,093 --> 00:48:13,293
What can you do to wash together?

944
00:48:16,648 --> 00:48:17,843
Be careful.

945
00:48:21,648 --> 00:48:23,898
- It's a real countryside. - It's refreshing.

946
00:48:24,867 --> 00:48:26,163
What's to do here?

947
00:48:26,367 --> 00:48:27,859
Is that where they have cows?

948
00:48:27,890 --> 00:48:30,984
- Did they go to catch grasshoppers? - Are they going somewhere to eat?

949
00:48:31,039 --> 00:48:34,972
It'd be funny if the 4 of them were going to eat like that.

950
00:48:42,523 --> 00:48:44,523
- What is that? - It's a greenhouse.

951
00:48:44,584 --> 00:48:46,491
They must have a hot spring in there.

952
00:48:46,516 --> 00:48:48,007
I really wanted to come here.

953
00:48:48,038 --> 00:48:51,061
- I was going to come here with Yeon-ji. - For a long time.

954
00:48:51,086 --> 00:48:54,491
- You guys planned this? - Yeah we wanted to come here together.

955
00:48:55,414 --> 00:48:57,538
He's cute. Look at him sitting like he's waiting for me.

956
00:48:57,601 --> 00:49:00,273
- Hello. - Hello.

957
00:49:01,047 --> 00:49:04,380
- Are you here to volunteer for the pound? - Yes.

958
00:49:04,734 --> 00:49:07,116
Seok-hee has such a kind heart!

959
00:49:07,382 --> 00:49:12,624
I'm so shocked that people would abandon their dogs on the road.

960
00:49:12,649 --> 00:49:15,288
- I heard there's a lot of those. - Seriously!

961
00:49:15,414 --> 00:49:17,398
Let me tell you a story that will make you angry.

962
00:49:17,423 --> 00:49:19,296
I do a show in Ulleungdo Island.

963
00:49:19,461 --> 00:49:23,061
People come there on trips and leave their dogs there.

964
00:49:23,273 --> 00:49:24,452
On their trips?

965
00:49:24,914 --> 00:49:29,148
Why would they bring them all the way to Ulleungdo Island to abandon them?

966
00:49:30,531 --> 00:49:31,851
Oh my gosh!

967
00:49:32,101 --> 00:49:34,901
There are so many people who abandon dogs.

968
00:49:46,804 --> 00:49:49,804
Seok-hee is interested in volunteering.

969
00:49:49,828 --> 00:49:51,437
- For dogs? - Not just that.

970
00:49:51,515 --> 00:49:55,182
She volunteers at the children center and elderly homes.

971
00:49:56,179 --> 00:49:58,859
- Can we go in? - Yes. Take these gloves.

972
00:49:58,984 --> 00:50:00,905
Let's tie our hair first.

973
00:50:01,429 --> 00:50:05,101
The city must run the pound, right?

974
00:50:05,185 --> 00:50:08,256
Oh, it's run by an individual? That's amazing.

975
00:50:08,625 --> 00:50:10,710
He must love animals.

976
00:50:10,735 --> 00:50:12,726
They send them for adoption, right?

977
00:50:14,242 --> 00:50:15,242
Let's go.

978
00:50:17,819 --> 00:50:19,398
It's really tiring.

979
00:50:21,897 --> 00:50:22,897
Hi!

980
00:50:22,966 --> 00:50:23,967
They're so cute.

981
00:50:24,046 --> 00:50:25,983
- I want to touch them. - How cute.

982
00:50:33,983 --> 00:50:36,583
- You can come in. - Look at his face.

983
00:50:38,070 --> 00:50:39,070
Hi.

984
00:50:50,063 --> 00:50:53,453
They're so excited. They miss people.

985
00:50:54,704 --> 00:50:57,086
You see the white pads?

986
00:50:57,321 --> 00:50:59,140
There are sick ones too.

987
00:51:03,719 --> 00:51:06,186
- How cute. - You can give me those.

988
00:51:08,516 --> 00:51:10,594
How cute.

989
00:51:13,484 --> 00:51:15,258
Cute!

990
00:51:21,579 --> 00:51:23,305
Seok-hee is really good at that.

991
00:51:23,375 --> 00:51:28,734
Even when she had a part time job, she'd volunteer to clean the bathroom.

992
00:51:32,375 --> 00:51:34,555
Please move, I need to wipe.

993
00:51:38,618 --> 00:51:41,367
- They love people. - It looks like it.

994
00:51:41,617 --> 00:51:43,437
- He's peeing again. - Where?

995
00:51:43,462 --> 00:51:44,617
Which one?

996
00:51:44,797 --> 00:51:47,609
- Because there aren't pads. - How could you?

997
00:51:47,688 --> 00:51:49,430
Where did he pee?

998
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:51,336
Over there.

999
00:51:53,657 --> 00:51:54,937
My back hurts.

1000
00:51:55,469 --> 00:51:56,869
Straighten your neck.

1001
00:51:57,008 --> 00:51:58,797
Yo-Han really is tall.

1002
00:51:58,822 --> 00:52:00,140
He's really tall.

1003
00:52:00,329 --> 00:52:01,329
Yo-Han...

1004
00:52:01,914 --> 00:52:03,703
Oh my!

1005
00:52:05,329 --> 00:52:06,633
There's space to breathe.

1006
00:52:06,688 --> 00:52:08,015
Please move.

1007
00:52:08,180 --> 00:52:09,539
We cleaned everything, right?

1008
00:52:09,564 --> 00:52:11,937
Doesn't he look like a clown from the back?

1009
00:52:11,962 --> 00:52:14,172
- His pants. - Or the guy on wooden sticks.

1010
00:52:14,266 --> 00:52:16,466
Do we put them out in the corner?

1011
00:52:16,532 --> 00:52:18,015
Hold on.

1012
00:52:18,585 --> 00:52:20,062
He's so tiny.

1013
00:52:20,344 --> 00:52:22,867
Look at them embracing people.

1014
00:52:23,656 --> 00:52:26,422
- That's heartbreaking. - We'll go to a different one now.

1015
00:52:26,710 --> 00:52:29,586
- There's a lot of cute ones. - Don't you feel proud?

1016
00:52:29,664 --> 00:52:34,406
You guys can split up into two groups and take out the water bowls.

1017
00:52:34,641 --> 00:52:37,851
- Water bowls? - Yes, you just need to take them out.

1018
00:52:37,953 --> 00:52:40,289
- Should we go in here? - Groups of two?

1019
00:52:40,422 --> 00:52:42,250
Yes. Two people per section.

1020
00:52:43,335 --> 00:52:44,726
Their nails!

1021
00:52:45,782 --> 00:52:47,115
They're going crazy.

1022
00:52:47,844 --> 00:52:49,377
They're full of energy.

1023
00:52:49,454 --> 00:52:52,654
I think Yo-Han would fall if there are big dogs.

1024
00:52:52,891 --> 00:52:55,312
Yo-Han is scared of the dogs.

1025
00:52:55,422 --> 00:52:59,164
He is scared of dogs, but his love for Seok-hee is greater.

1026
00:52:59,189 --> 00:53:00,431
That's why he came.

1027
00:53:02,813 --> 00:53:04,672
- Just this one, right? - Yes.

1028
00:53:04,719 --> 00:53:05,719
How cute!

1029
00:53:11,411 --> 00:53:12,625
What?

1030
00:53:15,235 --> 00:53:17,501
They really did something amazing.

1031
00:53:50,156 --> 00:53:52,383
They're like a married couple.

1032
00:53:52,500 --> 00:53:54,906
From your perspective, does Seok-hee...

1033
00:53:54,938 --> 00:53:56,656
She takes care of Yo-Han.

1034
00:53:56,681 --> 00:53:59,431
Even though she acts cold, she cares for him.

1035
00:53:59,477 --> 00:54:01,944
It's like she's taking care of a kid.

1036
00:54:02,899 --> 00:54:04,805
- Like a mom? - Yes.

1037
00:54:04,969 --> 00:54:06,312
A motherly love.

1038
00:54:08,735 --> 00:54:11,468
I'll wash them with soap. You rinse them.

1039
00:54:11,766 --> 00:54:14,172
Wear the rubber gloves. You're going to hurt your hands.

1040
00:54:14,196 --> 00:54:15,662
They're uncomfortable.

1041
00:54:15,946 --> 00:54:19,547
- You're going to touch the poop. - I'll just wash my hands after.

1042
00:54:19,625 --> 00:54:21,148
Yeah.

1043
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:23,890
Seok-hee is a good worker.

1044
00:54:24,086 --> 00:54:26,594
- No, you rinse them. - She's not wearing the gloves?

1045
00:54:26,743 --> 00:54:27,969
Put them on!

1046
00:54:29,836 --> 00:54:30,836
It's fine.

1047
00:54:32,141 --> 00:54:35,031
It has the dogs' poop.

1048
00:54:35,657 --> 00:54:38,328
Seok-hee must really love animals.

1049
00:54:54,204 --> 00:54:56,109
They have a cat house too?

1050
00:54:58,633 --> 00:55:00,351
They're a bit cleaner.

1051
00:55:00,446 --> 00:55:01,984
Cats are clean.

1052
00:55:03,305 --> 00:55:05,594
Yeon-ji and Hyung-tae are here.

1053
00:55:05,758 --> 00:55:07,558
Oh yeah, Yeon-ji has a cat.

1054
00:55:07,914 --> 00:55:10,314
My cat is the cutest cat in my eyes.

1055
00:55:10,579 --> 00:55:11,579
How cute!

1056
00:55:12,109 --> 00:55:13,109
Look at him!

1057
00:55:18,453 --> 00:55:24,242
Real couples volunteer together. And people who volunteer together can end up together.

1058
00:55:24,594 --> 00:55:29,953
My colleague also met his wife at a group like this.

1059
00:55:29,978 --> 00:55:30,978
He did?

1060
00:55:35,485 --> 00:55:37,687
Oh yeah, I bet no one plays with them.

1061
00:55:37,758 --> 00:55:38,758
Yeah.

1062
00:55:48,250 --> 00:55:49,917
I don't want to admit it.

1063
00:55:50,430 --> 00:55:52,830
It smells like the tuna can we have.

1064
00:55:56,868 --> 00:55:58,534
Should I leave this here?

1065
00:55:58,875 --> 00:56:01,475
Will they eat it if we put it in there?

1066
00:56:04,141 --> 00:56:05,719
That must be good.

1067
00:56:06,907 --> 00:56:08,453
I'm hungry.

1068
00:56:08,524 --> 00:56:10,924
You're hungry after seeing cat food?

1069
00:56:11,726 --> 00:56:15,367
- We need to go inside. - Oh, this was the water?

1070
00:56:18,610 --> 00:56:21,422
Have some water. You were thirsty!

1071
00:56:28,985 --> 00:56:30,734
You're cute.

1072
00:56:30,985 --> 00:56:32,781
You're cute.

1073
00:56:34,844 --> 00:56:36,265
They're attacking him.

1074
00:56:36,297 --> 00:56:39,364
It means the dogs are looking down on him too.

1075
00:56:40,032 --> 00:56:41,633
They think he's below them.

1076
00:56:41,704 --> 00:56:43,015
They know the hierarchy.

1077
00:56:43,032 --> 00:56:45,500
They've decided on the hierarchy.

1078
00:56:45,899 --> 00:56:49,094
For the last step, you'll bathe the dogs.

1079
00:56:49,625 --> 00:56:51,092
How should I hold him?

1080
00:56:52,578 --> 00:56:54,890
- Like this? - Is this where the text is from?

1081
00:56:54,993 --> 00:56:55,993
I think so.

1082
00:56:59,657 --> 00:57:01,590
Should we start from the top?

1083
00:57:01,618 --> 00:57:04,781
It must be nice to do that with the person you love.

1084
00:57:04,821 --> 00:57:06,287
In that kind of space.

1085
00:57:06,532 --> 00:57:08,805
You'll be blessed from the volunteering.

1086
00:57:08,907 --> 00:57:11,640
It'd be really nice if you have the same mind regarding that.

1087
00:57:11,704 --> 00:57:14,047
It must be nice to have someone bathe you.

1088
00:57:14,086 --> 00:57:15,220
No one bathes me.

1089
00:57:15,422 --> 00:57:17,437
Do you want me to bathe you?

1090
00:57:18,539 --> 00:57:20,406
Do you want to get slapped by my dad?

1091
00:57:20,431 --> 00:57:21,898
I mean just your face!

1092
00:57:22,344 --> 00:57:27,187
She didn't slap him because she had soap in her hands.

1093
00:57:28,219 --> 00:57:31,552
Because she needs to hit him with the shower head.

1094
00:57:34,336 --> 00:57:35,736
It feels good, right?

1095
00:57:39,789 --> 00:57:41,656
We can keep these on, right?

1096
00:57:43,696 --> 00:57:45,351
Do that thing dogs do.

1097
00:57:45,610 --> 00:57:47,810
- There you go. - He's doing it!

1098
00:57:49,485 --> 00:57:51,685
- This way? - No, the other way.

1099
00:57:57,571 --> 00:58:02,914
Seok-hee really opens her heart to the dogs.

1100
00:58:03,360 --> 00:58:04,826
Let's go. You're done.

1101
00:58:16,352 --> 00:58:20,328
Seo-beom, have you volunteered with your wife?

1102
00:58:20,414 --> 00:58:21,594
He does a lot.

1103
00:58:21,672 --> 00:58:23,180
I go on a couple.

1104
00:58:23,235 --> 00:58:25,390
My wife does a lot of them.

1105
00:58:25,704 --> 00:58:27,970
She must've learned from you guys.

1106
00:58:28,219 --> 00:58:30,922
We're going to walk the dogs now.

1107
00:58:31,172 --> 00:58:35,015
There are two dachshunds, and remember the malamute from earlier?

1108
00:58:35,079 --> 00:58:36,145
- Yes. - Right.

1109
00:58:36,157 --> 00:58:37,823
We're going to walk them.

1110
00:58:37,968 --> 00:58:39,914
You have to walk the dogs.

1111
00:58:40,125 --> 00:58:42,234
Dachshunds are really strong.

1112
00:58:42,680 --> 00:58:43,875
They're super strong.

1113
00:58:43,922 --> 00:58:45,656
- With those legs. - Yes.

1114
00:58:47,655 --> 00:58:50,094
- Hold on. - What's going on?

1115
00:58:55,438 --> 00:58:58,289
- A big dog! A husky! It's a malamute.

1116
00:59:04,375 --> 00:59:05,953
He's too strong!

1117
00:59:06,219 --> 00:59:08,367
The leash is tangled.

1118
00:59:08,414 --> 00:59:10,156
Come here. Your arm!

1119
00:59:10,796 --> 00:59:14,125
- I think that's the leg. - Your leg!

1120
00:59:14,969 --> 00:59:16,236
He's really strong.

1121
00:59:16,999 --> 00:59:19,399
- Really? - He's going to drag you.

1122
00:59:19,805 --> 00:59:20,805
You can go.

1123
00:59:21,617 --> 00:59:24,109
The dog is the one walking Yo-Han.

1124
00:59:24,218 --> 00:59:25,719
No!

1125
00:59:26,968 --> 00:59:29,500
He's the dog that pulls sleighs. He's really strong.

1126
00:59:29,524 --> 00:59:31,057
He has to run with him.

1127
00:59:31,320 --> 00:59:34,242
- Calm down! - The malamute is walking Yo-Han.

1128
00:59:34,657 --> 00:59:35,657
Yo-Han, no!

1129
00:59:37,546 --> 00:59:39,180
You can't go that way!

1130
00:59:39,344 --> 00:59:42,555
- He used the formal tone just now! - To the dog.

1131
00:59:49,219 --> 00:59:51,086
What is Yo-han's arm breaks?

1132
00:59:52,813 --> 00:59:54,213
Yo-Han, run with him.

1133
00:59:54,524 --> 00:59:56,367
Go!

1134
01:00:00,016 --> 01:00:01,016
Let's go.

1135
01:00:02,016 --> 01:00:03,922
Yo-Han!

1136
01:00:05,211 --> 01:00:06,586
Who's the owner?

1137
01:00:07,906 --> 01:00:09,390
He's going to fall!

1138
01:00:09,851 --> 01:00:12,192
It's like he's ploughing the field.

1139
01:00:13,984 --> 01:00:15,172
Ploughing...

1140
01:00:16,102 --> 01:00:17,976
His power is beyond your imagination.

1141
01:00:18,047 --> 01:00:19,047
I want to try

1142
01:00:19,883 --> 01:00:20,883
Let's go!

1143
01:00:23,054 --> 01:00:24,953
Say, "Let's go." Then he'll run.

1144
01:00:28,413 --> 01:00:29,813
You're really strong.

1145
01:00:30,124 --> 01:00:31,858
The malamute knows.

1146
01:00:31,999 --> 01:00:33,999
He knows she's done it before.

1147
01:00:34,024 --> 01:00:36,091
"This human is stronger than me."

1148
01:00:38,905 --> 01:00:40,452
Don't get tangled up.

1149
01:00:40,882 --> 01:00:41,882
It's okay.

1150
01:00:42,155 --> 01:00:44,355
How did they end up at the pound?

1151
01:00:44,936 --> 01:00:48,780
Our team recently rescued these two.

1152
01:00:48,960 --> 01:00:53,795
Because the breeding place went out of business, they threw them away in a box.

1153
01:00:53,905 --> 01:00:55,172
So we rescued them.

1154
01:00:55,554 --> 01:00:56,741
A breeding center.

1155
01:00:56,858 --> 01:00:59,061
How did Tansang end up here?

1156
01:00:59,146 --> 01:01:05,811
Tansang was found in the winter without his genitals.

1157
01:01:05,968 --> 01:01:06,968
What?

1158
01:01:07,061 --> 01:01:11,334
Because the owner hit him so much, his genitalia fell off.

1159
01:01:11,811 --> 01:01:16,803
He must've been in a lot of pain since it was cold.

1160
01:01:16,944 --> 01:01:19,264
How badly was he beaten?

1161
01:01:21,249 --> 01:01:23,131
It's very sad.

1162
01:01:23,780 --> 01:01:26,662
I bet the owner would recognize him if he saw this.

1163
01:01:26,725 --> 01:01:27,725
Yeah.

1164
01:01:27,749 --> 01:01:31,022
They wouldn't even feel bad if they were able to abuse their dog like that.

1165
01:01:31,061 --> 01:01:33,061
Of course. They're not normal.

1166
01:01:33,655 --> 01:01:38,295
He was really scared of people at first and was on guard.

1167
01:01:39,827 --> 01:01:41,405
Did he recover?

1168
01:01:41,430 --> 01:01:42,563
He's healthy now?

1169
01:01:42,588 --> 01:01:43,922
He loves people now.

1170
01:01:43,947 --> 01:01:45,506
- It looks like it. - That's great.

1171
01:01:45,561 --> 01:01:47,828
He followed me from the beginning.

1172
01:01:50,483 --> 01:01:54,170
You must be sad every time you get a new dog.

1173
01:01:54,280 --> 01:01:59,194
They come here with some pain in their hearts.

1174
01:02:13,162 --> 01:02:16,811
People shouldn't abandon them, and they shouldn't get dogs without thinking.

1175
01:02:16,890 --> 01:02:19,223
Of course. It's like raising a kid.

1176
01:02:19,248 --> 01:02:20,358
- Yes. - Seriously.

1177
01:02:20,436 --> 01:02:22,577
People have to think things through.

1178
01:02:22,663 --> 01:02:24,530
Not just out of curiosity...

1179
01:02:28,319 --> 01:02:29,936
Let's go inside.

1180
01:02:30,061 --> 01:02:31,436
Bye!

1181
01:02:31,546 --> 01:02:32,787
Bye Tansang!

1182
01:02:32,812 --> 01:02:34,479
It was a really good day.

1183
01:02:35,905 --> 01:02:37,100
Bye Tansang.

1184
01:02:37,765 --> 01:02:40,334
- Bye! - Take care!

1185
01:02:41,272 --> 01:02:43,739
I heard saying goodbye is really sad.

1186
01:02:43,929 --> 01:02:45,462
You end up going again.

1187
01:02:45,600 --> 01:02:47,123
It's hard to even watch the clip.

1188
01:02:47,179 --> 01:02:48,912
Yeon-ji likes animals too.

1189
01:02:50,475 --> 01:02:53,264
They can't talk, but I'm sure they were very happy too.

1190
01:02:53,304 --> 01:02:54,733
- The dogs? - Yes.

1191
01:03:00,201 --> 01:03:01,209
Bye!

1192
01:03:02,108 --> 01:03:03,311
This is sad.

1193
01:03:04,983 --> 01:03:06,428
I got attached.

1194
01:03:09,116 --> 01:03:10,649
It was a rewarding day.

1195
01:03:12,265 --> 01:03:14,764
It was sad but...

1196
01:03:15,390 --> 01:03:17,780
The dogs were so bright, so it was great.

1197
01:03:18,561 --> 01:03:20,272
- We can come back. - Yeah.

1198
01:03:20,304 --> 01:03:22,342
We should come often and play with them.

1199
01:03:22,373 --> 01:03:24,780
This is pretty close to our homes, right?

1200
01:03:24,960 --> 01:03:26,760
I really want to come back.

1201
01:03:27,038 --> 01:03:28,928
- For Tansang? - You really want to do it?

1202
01:03:28,952 --> 01:03:30,085
Yes, I really do.

1203
01:03:32,405 --> 01:03:35,608
It was a good date for everyone.

1204
01:03:35,640 --> 01:03:39,889
It'd be nice if you went on a volunteering date with your future girlfriend.

1205
01:03:39,991 --> 01:03:41,014
It's a better date.

1206
01:03:41,039 --> 01:03:43,342
You get close from the meaningful time.

1207
01:03:43,367 --> 01:03:44,467
They worked very hard.

1208
01:03:44,483 --> 01:03:48,530
- You're seeing a new side of her. - I'm proud of her.

1209
01:03:48,563 --> 01:03:50,045
You must be proud.

1210
01:03:50,671 --> 01:03:54,905
I think my kids will learn from this too.

1211
01:03:54,930 --> 01:03:56,248
It's not an easy thing to do.

1212
01:03:56,273 --> 01:04:01,350
I saw today that Seok-hee is a woman of actions.

1213
01:04:01,375 --> 01:04:02,889
They're a charming couple.

1214
01:04:02,905 --> 01:04:06,827
- We'll see you next week! - That's all for today!

1215
01:04:07,468 --> 01:04:08,468
Hello.

1216
01:04:09,116 --> 01:04:10,849
You look prettier in person.

1217
01:04:11,334 --> 01:04:12,709
They look very good together.

1218
01:04:12,734 --> 01:04:15,436
- He has a nice first impression. - That's good.

1219
01:04:15,461 --> 01:04:17,794
It's because his last name is Song.

1220
01:04:18,349 --> 01:04:20,780
- Do you know Ahn Jae-wook's hair? - Did that shock you?

1221
01:04:20,805 --> 01:04:22,912
He's joking around. Although they're dad jokes...

1222
01:04:22,983 --> 01:04:24,383
Want me to teach you?

1223
01:04:29,358 --> 01:04:31,584
- Let's ask them to take a picture! - Just stand there!

1224
01:04:31,609 --> 01:04:34,647
- He wants to take it together. - Just stand there!

1225
01:04:34,686 --> 01:04:36,753
I told you I was making a song.

1226
01:04:36,778 --> 01:04:37,778
A song?
