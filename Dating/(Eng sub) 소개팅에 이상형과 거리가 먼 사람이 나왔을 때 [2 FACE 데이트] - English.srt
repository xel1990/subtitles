Hello I am a freelance model Jung Sunyoung

[Q. What is your ideal type of boyfriend?]
I like someone who is somewhat like a bear?

a little big and tall

Hello

00:00:28,804 --> 00:00:30,138
Hi

00:00:30,534 --> 00:00:32,500
I am 25 years old and I'm Jung Minjun

[Q. What is your ideal type of girlfriend?]
I like people who are

12
00:00:36,767 --> 00:00:41,134
cute and feminine

13
00:00:41,935 --> 00:00:42,870
Nice to meet you

14
00:00:43,004 --> 00:00:44,205

[30 minutes of blind date start]
Oh no it's fine

31
00:01:27,201 --> 00:01:28,901
It's not humid so that's good

32
00:01:28,969 --> 00:01:29,902
Yeah it is

33
00:01:30,603 --> 00:01:31,503
How old are you?

34
00:01:31,937 --> 00:01:33,404
I'm 25

35
00:01:33,738 --> 00:01:34,738
And you?

36
00:01:34,906 --> 00:01:35,906
Me too

37
00:01:35,907 --> 00:01:36,907
Oh we're the same age

38
00:01:36,908 --> 00:01:37,908
Yeah

00:01:38,043 --> 00:01:38,909
You don't have to use polite language

40
00:01:39,010 --> 00:01:40,510
Oh yeah

41
00:01:41,353 --> 00:01:43,311
I will later 

42
00:01:43,312 --> 00:01:44,312
Did you eat yet?

43
00:01:44,513 --> 00:01:46,647

No not yet

44
00:01:47,482 --> 00:01:51,317
[Q.Why did you click dislike all of a sudden?)]
I hesitated

45
00:01:52,067 --> 00:01:56,800
but he was not really my type

46
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:01,433
and ripped jeans and a T-shirt was a little off for a

00:02:04,934 --> 00:02:06,300
where did you come from just now?

49
00:02:06,567 --> 00:02:08,001
From Sinlim

50
00:02:08,003 --> 00:02:10,135
Oh Sinlim, with your family?

51
00:02:10,136 --> 00:02:12,571
No I live alone

52
00:02:12,572 --> 00:02:13,573
Oh really?

53
00:02:13,574 --> 00:02:14,705
Yeah

54
00:02:14,734 --> 00:02:18,167
That must be hard, I lived in Sinlim too 

55
00:02:18,402 --> 00:02:19,402
There is this place called Culture street?

00:02:19,637 --> 00:02:20,904
Fashion culture street?

57
00:02:21,005 --> 00:02:24,540
I lived there with my friend

58
00:02:24,573 --> 00:02:25,573
Why?

59
00:02:25,741 --> 00:02:28,241
I was at school 

60
00:02:28,943 --> 00:02:33,442
and I wanted to be less of a burden to my parents

61
00:02:34,067 --> 00:02:36,801
but it was not easy

62
00:02:37,403 --> 00:02:39,970
Right, help yourself

63
00:02:40,171 --> 00:02:42,271
Yeah, you too

64
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:50,433
Do you want something in particular? Help yourself

65
00:02:50,434 --> 00:02:51,268
Yeah

[The other person doesn't know whether I pressed the button.]

67
00:02:54,934 --> 00:02:57,033
Is there a knife here?

68
00:02:58,267 --> 00:03:02,567

70
00:03:06,601 --> 00:03:10,967
[[Q.Why did you press 'hate it' button all of a sudden?)]
I clicked dislike because it was so awkward and

71
00:03:11,268 --> 00:03:12,268
 I wanted to not be there

72
00:03:13,767 --> 00:03:16,799
You can ask me anything if you want

73
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,900
sure after this

74
00:03:18,933 --> 00:03:21,399
What hobbies do you have?

75
00:03:21,633 --> 00:03:24,403
I like cooking

76
00:03:24,604 --> 00:03:26,905
That's really nice

77
00:03:26,906 --> 00:03:28,206
I really like cooking

78
00:03:28,407 --> 00:03:30,041
Do you know this thing

79
00:03:30,675 --> 00:03:33,409
called air-frier?

80
00:03:33,544 --> 00:03:36,810
I got it too, it's really good for a diet

81
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:42,533
I put a lot of sweet potatoes 

82
00:03:42,567 --> 00:03:46,867
It's a lot cheaper these days

83
00:03:47,667 --> 00:03:49,800
I'm not into it a lot

84
00:03:49,999 --> 00:03:51,899
but there's a lot you can do with it

85
00:03:52,367 --> 00:03:54,900
you can cook really easily

86
00:03:55,202 --> 00:03:57,368
so I recommended it

87
00:03:57,901 --> 00:03:59,835
You're not here to advertise right?

88
00:03:59,837 --> 00:04:02,404
No, I don't even for there

89
00:04:03,198 --> 00:04:05,700
[Q. You had a conversation about a air-pair conversation all of a sudden]
It was so funny,

90
00:04:05,701 --> 00:04:09,897
talking about that in a blind date

91
00:04:09,898 --> 00:04:11,799
but it was kinda cute

92
00:04:12,333 --> 00:04:17,501
I thought that we were that much running out of topics to discuss

93
00:04:17,802 --> 00:04:20,603
Have you been to Borame park? It's nice

94
00:04:20,604 --> 00:04:21,772
Really? I have never been there

95
00:04:21,872 --> 00:04:22,572
Never?

96
00:04:22,573 --> 00:04:22,940
Yeah

97
00:04:23,108 --> 00:04:26,108
It's great there are lots of Pikachus

98
00:04:27,067 --> 00:04:29,967
if you play Pokemon Go it's a great place to be

99
00:04:30,268 --> 00:04:31,068
Borame Park?

100
00:04:31,169 --> 00:04:31,836
Yeah

101
00:04:32,701 --> 00:04:36,767
I went hunting too when I was living in Sinlim

102
00:04:37,468 --> 00:04:38,902
for Pikachus

103
00:04:39,736 --> 00:04:42,570
[Q. Why did you have a conversation about 'Pikachu' all of a sudden?]
It was a huge thing a while ago

104
00:04:42,801 --> 00:04:45,500
It was really famous for having lots of pikachus

105
00:04:45,667 --> 00:04:48,934
since she said she lived there too

106
00:04:49,335 --> 00:04:51,602
I thought it would be something to talk about

107
00:04:51,837 --> 00:04:52,837
Do you play it these days as well?

108
00:04:53,005 --> 00:04:53,838
Not these days

109
00:04:54,105 --> 00:04:56,308
Anything else you like?

110
00:04:56,543 --> 00:04:58,376
I like taking pictures

111
00:04:58,544 --> 00:04:59,744
Pictures?

112
00:05:00,034 --> 00:05:02,235
I like it a lot 
-Me too

113
00:05:02,236 --> 00:05:03,238
Do you like taking pictures? 
-Yeah

114
00:05:03,239 --> 00:05:04,140
Really?

115
00:05:04,141 --> 00:05:07,433
I ordered a camera recently

116
00:05:07,433 --> 00:05:10,502
You like taking pictures yourself?

117
00:05:10,503 --> 00:05:12,705
Or being taken?

118
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:17,868
I'll take a picture of you sometime 
-Thanks

119
00:05:17,868 --> 00:05:19,634
I like taking pictures

120
00:05:19,635 --> 00:05:22,500
and she likes being taken

121
00:05:22,668 --> 00:05:25,832
it's not easy to find someone who likes to be taken pictures

122
00:05:25,832 --> 00:05:28,767
I clicked the like button then

123
00:05:29,835 --> 00:05:32,034
[15 minutes after the blind date]
Do you like interior design too?

124
00:05:32,135 --> 00:05:33,335
Yeah

125
00:05:33,533 --> 00:05:34,332
Really?

126
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:36,634
I like simple designs

127
00:05:36,734 --> 00:05:38,368
I clean all the time

128
00:05:38,368 --> 00:05:39,104
Oh me too

129
00:05:39,105 --> 00:05:40,341
Really? 
-Yeah

130
00:05:40,342 --> 00:05:42,433
You need to clean well when you're living by yourself
-Yeah

131
00:05:42,534 --> 00:05:44,102
When I was living by myself

132
00:05:44,103 --> 00:05:48,437
I had wet paper towels

133
00:05:51,366 --> 00:05:56,167
I clicked the like button when he said he liked cleaning

134
00:05:56,168 --> 00:06:00,068
not because he likes cleaning

135
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:03,670
but he tried to find something in common

136
00:06:03,671 --> 00:06:06,533
and that was sweet

137
00:06:06,768 --> 00:06:08,269
[21 minutes after the blind date]
I have a question

138
00:06:09,169 --> 00:06:12,104
What do you think about girls and guys being friends?

139
00:06:12,438 --> 00:06:14,600
Do you think they can be?

140
00:06:14,601 --> 00:06:16,538
It is somewhat random

141
00:06:16,539 --> 00:06:19,639
I do have friends who are girls 

142
00:06:20,303 --> 00:06:24,301
like watching a movie during the day

143
00:06:24,302 --> 00:06:26,500
Movie?

144
00:06:26,501 --> 00:06:27,501
Yeah

145
00:06:28,566 --> 00:06:32,166
I don't do that when I have a boy friend

146
00:06:32,366 --> 00:06:34,233
Right sure

147
00:06:34,701 --> 00:06:37,001
but when you don't -Yeah

148
00:06:37,002 --> 00:06:38,832
when you are not dating anyone you don't really have anyone to go to the movies with

149
00:06:38,834 --> 00:06:42,068
When there is, you do what they say

150
00:06:42,168 --> 00:06:44,001
If they say 'don't' I would say 'okay'

151
00:06:44,502 --> 00:06:48,067
Not doing the thing they don't like is the best policy

152
00:06:48,068 --> 00:06:50,269
to avoid fighting

153
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:52,400
Do you fight hard?

154
00:06:52,668 --> 00:06:55,034
I hate fighting

155
00:06:55,065 --> 00:06:58,032
I don't even fight with my friends

156
00:06:58,033 --> 00:07:01,401
So I'd just say 'okay fine'

157
00:07:01,403 --> 00:07:04,103
'I'm sorry I won't do it again'

158
00:07:07,804 --> 00:07:09,371
I don't really get mad easily

159
00:07:09,371 --> 00:07:11,239
Not really

160
00:07:11,435 --> 00:07:13,902
Unless someone hits me from the back all of a sudden

161
00:07:13,903 --> 00:07:18,137
right a girl friend doesn't do that usually

162
00:07:18,501 --> 00:07:22,467
I'd let my girl friend hit me from the back once or twice

163
00:07:22,601 --> 00:07:28,735
I guess we had that in common, we both didn't like fighting

164
00:07:28,736 --> 00:07:31,433
I thought that we wouldn't 

165
00:07:31,834 --> 00:07:33,734
so I clicked like

166
00:07:34,302 --> 00:07:37,469
[26 minutes after the blind date]
I ride the bike at night if I feel like it

167
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:40,037
or take a walk and go to the fish tank

168
00:07:40,038 --> 00:07:42,306
I like fish a lot -Oh really?

169
00:07:42,307 --> 00:07:45,840
Yeah I go to the aquariums all the time

170
00:07:45,842 --> 00:07:47,610
I come from Busan

171
00:07:47,611 --> 00:07:48,878
Me too

172
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:49,879
Really?

173
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:50,678
Where?

174
00:07:50,679 --> 00:07:51,679
Seomyun

175
00:07:51,801 --> 00:07:53,202
That's a little far from where I'm from

176
00:07:53,203 --> 00:07:54,203
Where?

177
00:07:54,203 --> 00:07:55,471
Jangsan, do you know?

178
00:07:55,472 --> 00:07:56,506
Yeah I do

179
00:07:56,507 --> 00:07:58,541
A little over Haeundae

180
00:07:58,542 --> 00:07:59,542
I lived in Jadong

181
00:07:59,710 --> 00:08:00,977
You are also a Busan person

182
00:08:01,201 --> 00:08:03,835
You don't have the dialect at all

183
00:08:03,836 --> 00:08:06,970
People made fun of it so much I changed it

184
00:08:06,971 --> 00:08:09,306
They were calling me a village boy, but Busan is not a village

185
00:08:09,307 --> 00:08:11,373
Nonsense -Right?

186
00:08:11,441 --> 00:08:12,842
They called me names yeah

187
00:08:13,076 --> 00:08:15,310
It's great to see a Busan person 

188
00:08:15,312 --> 00:08:17,909
I think I don't know your name

189
00:08:17,911 --> 00:08:18,979
What is your name?

190
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:22,179
Jung Sunyoung

191
00:08:22,181 --> 00:08:23,547
Jung Sunyoung? 

192
00:08:23,548 --> 00:08:26,715
I am also Jung, Jung Minjun

193
00:08:26,769 --> 00:08:29,900
I'm sorry I didn't ask

194
00:08:30,501 --> 00:08:32,303
Slipped my mind

195
00:08:33,337 --> 00:08:34,971
[Q. Do you think Sunyoung pressed the 'hate it' button?]
I think she would have clicked dislike

196
00:08:34,972 --> 00:08:35,972
In the beginning I was talking

197
00:08:36,601 --> 00:08:40,135
and I didn't even ask her name

198
00:08:40,136 --> 00:08:41,870
Was that bothering you?

199
00:08:41,871 --> 00:08:43,238
Not at all

200
00:08:43,239 --> 00:08:47,373
I knew that I didn't know his name

201
00:08:47,568 --> 00:08:50,800
but he was trying so hard

202
00:08:51,201 --> 00:08:53,733
I didn't want to lead the conversation

203
00:08:53,834 --> 00:08:55,934
to make him feel bad

204
00:08:57,635 --> 00:08:58,899
[30 minutes of blind date ends]

205
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:02,267
You reached 30 minutes

206
00:09:04,101 --> 00:09:04,601
Thank you

207
00:09:04,602 --> 00:09:05,602
I didn't know it had been 30 minutes

208
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:09,935
[Q. How's your feel after the blind date?]
I didn't like how I was leading in the beginning

209
00:09:09,937 --> 00:09:12,237
But I liked it when he was trying

210
00:09:12,238 --> 00:09:16,507
I wanted to know him more

211
00:09:16,507 --> 00:09:21,135
So if we can see each other again, it would be nice

212
00:09:21,136 --> 00:09:24,067
[Q. How's your feel after the blind date?]
I liked how time passed quickly

213
00:09:24,068 --> 00:09:26,235
and it felt like it was not enough

214
00:09:26,236 --> 00:09:29,433
so I think we can have a longer time next time

215
00:09:29,434 --> 00:09:32,867
and have more conversations

216
00:09:41,769 --> 00:09:45,769
