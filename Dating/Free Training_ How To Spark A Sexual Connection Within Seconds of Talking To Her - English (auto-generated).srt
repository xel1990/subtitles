build that physical connection very
quickly in those type environments so

564
00:11:01,949 --> 00:11:01,959  
quickly in those type environments so
 

565
00:11:01,959 --> 00:11:04,450  
quickly in those type environments so
you have to remember to accommodate

your space get close stand up and act

572
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:12,770  
your space get close stand up and act
 

573
00:11:12,770 --> 00:11:15,940  
your space get close stand up and act
like you are supposed to be there this

574

like you are supposed to be there this
 

575
00:11:15,950 --> 00:11:18,610  
like you are supposed to be there this
next technique can literally make or

576
00:11:18,610 --> 00:11:18,620  
next technique can literally make or
 

577
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:21,190  
next technique can literally make or
break your approach it's called the look

578
00:11:21,190 --> 00:11:21,200  
break your approach it's called the look
 

579
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,490  
break your approach it's called the look
and it's based on how you feel

580
00:11:23,490 --> 00:11:23,500  
and it's based on how you feel
 

581
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:25,900  
and it's based on how you feel
internally yes it has to do with eye

582
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:25,910  
internally yes it has to do with eye
 

583
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:27,610  
internally yes it has to do with eye
contact and having good eye contact

584
00:11:27,610 --> 00:11:27,620  
contact and having good eye contact
 

585
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:30,490  
contact and having good eye contact
strong eye contact not looking away

586
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:30,500  
strong eye contact not looking away
 

587
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:32,710  
strong eye contact not looking away
because if you look away you kill the

588
00:11:32,710 --> 00:11:32,720  
because if you look away you kill the
 

589
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:36,430  
because if you look away you kill the
cute you killed the tension for example

590
00:11:36,430 --> 00:11:36,440  
cute you killed the tension for example
 

591
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:39,670  
cute you killed the tension for example
if I say hey you're really cute right it

592
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:39,680  
if I say hey you're really cute right it
 

593
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:40,330  
if I say hey you're really cute right it
looks awful

594
00:11:40,330 --> 00:11:40,340  
looks awful
 

595
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:42,820  
looks awful
so yes it's based on eye contact and

596
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:42,830  
so yes it's based on eye contact and
 

597
00:11:42,830 --> 00:11:45,190  
so yes it's based on eye contact and
maintaining that strong eye contact but

598
00:11:45,190 --> 00:11:45,200  
maintaining that strong eye contact but
 

599
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,300  
maintaining that strong eye contact but
it's much more than that

600
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:46,310  
it's much more than that
 

601
00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:49,030  
it's much more than that
it's very very subtle but this subtle

602
00:11:49,030 --> 00:11:49,040  
it's very very subtle but this subtle
 

603
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:53,260  
it's very very subtle but this subtle
difference makes a huge impact and it's

604
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:53,270  
difference makes a huge impact and it's
 

605
00:11:53,270 --> 00:11:55,060  
difference makes a huge impact and it's
gonna make her literally start getting

606
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:55,070  
gonna make her literally start getting
 

607
00:11:55,070 --> 00:11:57,700  
gonna make her literally start getting
aroused for you no matter what the

608
00:11:57,700 --> 00:11:57,710  
aroused for you no matter what the
 

609
00:11:57,710 --> 00:11:59,560  
aroused for you no matter what the
situation even if you're in a bookstore

610

00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:02,330  
or somewhere that's completely not a
 

613
00:12:02,330 --> 00:12:04,840  
or somewhere that's completely not a
sexual environment you do this for her

614
