1
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:08,660
Do you separate between those for dating and those for marrying?

2
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:13,300
Those having some distinctive feature, so called pretty girls, are not really my type.

3
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:15,960
I love floristry.

4
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:20,100
Some sort of unfair governmental regulation?

5
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:30,980
&lt;When a lawyer with deep voice meets to-be-music teacher&gt;

6
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:34,420
[Seung Woo Ko, 33 Years Old, Lawyer]

7
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:36,620

[Ji Young Lee, 27 Years Old, Music Teacher]
Hello. I am 27 years old Ji Young Lee, living in Banpo Dong.

9
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:44,000
I majored in Viola

10
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:47,980
and preparing to be a teacher in next year.

11
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:51,300
Q. Your type?
Personality really doesn’t matter.

12
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:53,660
Person itself is the most important.

13
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:55,080
The most important thing is… appearance?

14
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:56,320
Hahaha

15
00:00:57,080 --> 00:01:00,100
Warm and caring guy

16
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:02,220
like fatherly figure

17
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:04,720
I like someone with delicacy.

18
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:07,660
I am worried and excited at the same time.

19
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:11,320
-Hello

20
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:12,780
-Hello
-Hello

21
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:15,340
Q. May I ask what you are doing?

22
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:17,220
I am an attorney at law.

23
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:18,220
Aha

24
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:22,700
Q. May I ask your 3 strengths of yours?

25
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:23,660
My strength?

26
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:24,300
Yes

27
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:27,940
(Firstly) I live my life to the fullest

28
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:31,420
Secondly, I live well.

29
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:36,680
(Thirdly) I will live that way.

30
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:38,580
Those are three strengths I have.

31
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:43,820
Q. Do you have any cultural interest?

32
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:47,320
I do not have the preference.

33
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:49,620
Let say, going to a museum

34
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:54,800
I do like going to a movie or listening to a music.

35
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,580
But I do not usually go to concerts

36
00:01:56,580 --> 00:01:58,580
or have (specific cultural interest).

37
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:02,880
I expected someone with some sort of sensibility.

38
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,400
But

39
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:06,600
He does not seems to have (sensibility).

40
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:12,700
Q. Do you have any hobby that can be played or displayed proudly to others?

41
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,680
I love floristry,

42
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:19,060
which would have made me become a florist.

43
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:21,240
I’ve learned for a long time.

44
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:24,620
So floristry might fit for that answer.

45
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:26,480
Floristry…

46
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:29,920
Well it is just a hobby.

47
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:32,040
It seems to be a very neutral answer to me.

48
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:36,400
Q. What stands most important when seeing a woman?

49
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:42,440
I see when a woman is very distinguished in what she does very important.

50
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,040
Those who work very hard..

51
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,960
Someone who love herself

52
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:48,000
and her work

53
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:50,040
I found those women to be powerful

54
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,520
Uhm…

55
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:55,560
Then do you have a specific type, in appearance wise?

56
00:02:56,340 --> 00:03:02,840
Those having some distinctive feature, so called pretty girls,

57
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:07,160
do not go well with me usually.

58
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:12,820
I like someone with cute vibe.

59
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:15,560
You seem to weigh more on one’s vibe.

60
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:16,540
Yes.

61
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:20,280
His first word,

62
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:23,080
‘I like someone who is distinguished on what she is doing.’

63
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:25,140
Uhm..

64
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:28,800
sounds like he weights more on internal things

65
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:31,880
than external things.

66
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:38,460
Q. Your parents might have had certain wish toward your job

67
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:41,420
from the childhood.

68
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,260
If they have, what was it?

69
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:49,320
They would like me to have a stable job.

70
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:52,340
for example a teacher

71
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:55,160
So I am planning on becoming one next year.

72
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:56,340
Ah~

73
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:59,320
My father also practices law.

74
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:02,020
But he really does not want me to do also.

75
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:07,400
He just shows how it is being done by practicing it by himself to me.

76
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:09,860
Of course I have been influenced by that.

77
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:12,660
Q. Have you dated a woman

78
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:15,500
who was not so your type?

79
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:19,420
To be honest, your type changes

80
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:21,300
as you age,

81
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:24,760
or case by case.

82
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:30,360
So I do not think that your type only depends

83
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:34,820
on specific appearance or so.

84
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:36,420
Hmm

85
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:38,160
Yes that is me.

86
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:40,780
Q. When you are dating,

87
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:44,400
you get to meet his friends or colleagues.

88
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:48,700
For example, if your boyfriend would start the start-up company,

89
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:57,640
you might join some gathering of his with his colleagues or friends.

90
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:58,640
Uhm, yes.

91
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:02,560
What would you do?

92
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:08,120
I haven’t really had an experience of gather together when dating.

93
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,400
Ah yes.

94
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:12,900
So I haven’t had a lot of those gatherings.

95
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:17,060
I have become friends with them if I had the opportunity.

96
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:22,300
You do not like those gatherings?

97
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:25,320
It is not because I do not like it.

98
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:27,300
But I happened to see just each other.

99
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:28,440
Yes

100
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:32,920
Q. May I ask about your dating pattern or style?

101
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,860
I normally do

102
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,100
as women tends to please.

103
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:43,660
For example, ‘You call me certain times a day.’

104
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:46,120
‘You see me certain times a week.’

105
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:50,080
I do as she asks me to.

106
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:52,880
You adjust yourself to another very well.

107
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:56,260
I do not think that is an adjustment.

108
00:05:56,840 --> 00:06:01,200
I really do not mind.

109
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:04,280
Q. Do you prefer meat or raw fish?

110
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,120
I prefer meat.

111
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:10,240
Do you like lamb meat?

112
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,680
I love them.

113
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:12,820
Oh really?

114
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:16,560
Have you had lamb rib, not lamb chop?

115
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,140
I love lamb rib more than lamb chop.

116
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:19,300
That is awesome.

117
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,920
I love lamb meat.

118
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:27,220
Lamb meat are indeed excellent.

119
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:33,120
Women tend to not like lamb meat.

120
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:36,920
They are usually not fond of that funky smell.

121
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:40,340
But she said she loves it.

122
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:44,080
I moved toward her without noticing.

123
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:46,740
Q. Do you like cat?

124
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:47,540
A cat?

125
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:48,200
Yes

126
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,700
I used to have a cat.

127
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:50,980
Ah really?

128
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:52,840
I love cat and dog.

129
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:55,540
Ah I like that.

130
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:56,740
They are great.

131
00:06:56,740 --> 00:06:58,480
I love cats.

132
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:01,040
It’s been 7 years I’ve had a cat.

133
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:04,900
Those who are not pet people,

134
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:07,040
might not fit me well because I talk about cats all the time.

135
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:09,900
So I think those who like animals

136
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:14,280
tend to have a warm heart.

137
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:18,100
Q. Are you religious?

138
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:21,780
I am born Christian.

139
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:24,840
I go to church every Sunday.

140
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:33,140
Have you ever dated with someone not religious, or with different religion from you?

141
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:36,400
Most of them I’ve dated were not religious.

142
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:38,920
Do you preach?

143
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:43,040
If he is interested, I will.

144
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:46,120
If he is not, I would not feel the need to do it.

145
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:48,200
I see.

146
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:53,580
Q. Do you separate between those for dating and those for marrying?

147
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:57,740
When I date someone, I also consider a future with her.

148
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:01,400
Q. Do you appeal actively to someone you like?

149
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,860
I am always very active.

150
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:03,780
Ah~

151
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:07,680
Have you seen a woman being active?

152
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,100
Yes I have.

153
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:11,600
Doesn’t matter if it is a woman or man.

154
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:13,320
I am active

155
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:20,880
and those I’ve dated were mostly active.

156
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:35,620
Q. Is there a certain unfair governmental regulation on the industry you work in?

157
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:38,360
My major is music

158
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:42,980
and the market for it, or classic music market in Korea is very small.

159
00:08:43,660 --> 00:08:51,180
I would like to see those markets grow more and become more active.

160
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:56,400
I believe those who are very focused on the industry that they are working on

161
00:08:56,440 --> 00:09:00,300
and have been in that industry for a long time,

162
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,460
would have those kind of issues.

163
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:04,740
It is not like they are just doing things because it is given.

164
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:08,420
Those are the ones who prepare for the future.

165
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:11,780
So I asked that question.

166
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:16,600
Q. May I ask if you drink or smoke?

167
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,380
I do not smoke.

168
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:22,060
but I drink.

169
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:24,320
I love whisky.

170
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:28,900
It is not like I drink heavily.

171
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:32,420
I like whisky itself.

172
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:35,400
I am very much interested in liqueur kind and its culture.

173
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:37,940
I like to visit those whisky bards in Hannam.

174
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:38,960
Ah~

175
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:40,660
I go there time to time.

176
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:45,520
You are very similar to me that way.

177
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:48,540
Do you drink?

178
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:51,080
I like cocktails.

179
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:55,980
Each bars has their own signature cocktail.

180
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:56,800
Yes.

181
00:09:56,840 --> 00:10:00,100
I like to go and drink those.

182
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:02,580
Have you ever been to bar alone?

183
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:05,420
I have time to time.

184
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:06,680
To Bar?

185
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:07,280
Yes

186
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:08,300
Ah really?

187
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:09,380
Oh~

188
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:16,640
Women tend not to like whisky or cognac.

189
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:20,420
I enjoy drinking whisky.

190
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:24,540
I normally do not drink soju or beer that well.

191
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:27,340
I like that.

192
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,560
Blind-Date Finished

193
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:37,660
Now it is a time to check each other out!

194
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:56,060
-Hello

195
00:10:56,060 --> 00:10:57,360
-Hello
-Hello

196
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,100
Nice to meet you

197
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:01,920
You’ve done well.

198
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:05,060
What should I say?

199
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,900
You look much younger than I thought. I heard you are 33.

200
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:10,100
Ah really?

201
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:11,780
You are 27?

202
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:12,680
Yes

203
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:16,120
What do you play?

204
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:17,240
Viola

205
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:18,260
Ah really?

206
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:21,020
That is great.

207
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,920
Do you know Viola?

208
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:23,760
Of course.

209
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:24,640
Ah really?

210
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:27,400
I do not know that well.

211
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:29,020
It is okay.

212
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,320
Q. (During Blind-Date) How do you feel?
Her voice trembles at first.

213
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:37,300
Felt that she was a nice person.

214
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:41,660
If she does not tremble at all, it might have scared me.

215
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,280
Can I be honest? For real?

216
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:46,940
His voice was very good.

217
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,140
He talked too well.

218
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:52,100
He seems to be sly.

219
00:11:54,680 --> 00:12:00,460
She seems to talk and show her quality well through conversation.

220
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:02,160
It was very neutral.

221
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:04,060
I like neutral.

222
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:07,380
I would like to talk to him more?

223
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:13,080
His questions were a bit serious.

224
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:14,760
I liked that.

225
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:17,080
Q. How do you feel after checking each other out?
He seemed very polite.

226
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:20,080
I had different image in mind when talking to him.

227
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:23,520
Producer: Is he your type?

228
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:27,920
His appearance was.

229
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:30,280
She is pretty.

230
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:32,040
She seems polite.
