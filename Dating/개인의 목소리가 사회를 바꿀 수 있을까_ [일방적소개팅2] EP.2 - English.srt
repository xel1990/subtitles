1
00:00:00,917 --> 00:00:05,505
I’m curious about if you think that an individual’s voice can make a big impact on the society?

2
00:00:06,673 --> 00:00:09,342
20 people were recruited to be blind date participants

3
00:00:09,342 --> 00:00:11,136
One-sided Blind Date

4
00:00:20,103 --> 00:00:22,647
I chose female participant 7

5
00:00:22,647 --> 00:00:30,947
because I found her radiant smile to be beautiful

6
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:43,334
What am I going to do? This is so embarrassing

7
00:00:44,335 --> 00:00:46,421
- Hello
- Hello

8
00:00:46,421 --> 00:00:52,844
I saw your clip and chose you because your radiant smile was pretty

9
00:00:52,844 --> 00:00:54,637
Thank you

10
00:00:56,723 --> 00:00:58,975
Male
Answers the given question

11
00:00:58,975 --> 00:01:01,478
Female
Chooses the option they want

12
00:01:02,604 --> 00:01:07,901
-Inclination-

13
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:08,359
“Break”

14
00:01:08,359 --> 00:01:15,325
“Break”
Mountain vs Ocean

15
00:01:15,325 --> 00:01:15,992
I’m done

16
00:01:16,367 --> 00:01:17,452
For me, the ocean

17
00:01:20,997 --> 00:01:21,956
Ocean!

18
00:01:21,956 --> 00:01:24,667
- You must like the ocean?
- Yeah, I do like the ocean

19
00:01:24,667 --> 00:01:27,003
and don’t particularly like the mountain

20
00:01:27,003 --> 00:01:27,879
- Ah, really?
- Yes

21
00:01:27,879 --> 00:01:30,465
I really like playing in the water
Me too

22
00:01:30,465 --> 00:01:31,883
What type of water activities do you like?

23
00:01:31,883 --> 00:01:34,344
Although I can’t swim,

24
00:01:34,344 --> 00:01:37,013
, I like floating in water. It feels really nice.

25
00:01:37,013 --> 00:01:40,850
I usually take my vacations at the beach too

26
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:43,103
-...Okay
- Okay

27
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:46,606
“If your partner goes to the club”

28
00:01:46,606 --> 00:01:50,527
“If your partner goes to the club”
You are bothered vs You don’t care

29
00:01:50,527 --> 00:01:52,779
I think it’s okay to go,

30
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:54,447
but I’m sure it will bother me

31
00:01:57,075 --> 00:01:58,535
Ah, you absolutely don’t care?

32
00:01:58,535 --> 00:02:01,246
Normally when people say they are bothered,

33
00:02:01,246 --> 00:02:04,457
they call often, are very concerned,

34
00:02:04,457 --> 00:02:06,835
- and how do I say it, [the person clubbing] becomes a subject of suspicion
- Yes

35
00:02:06,835 --> 00:02:09,587
- I would like if both parties trusted each other
- Being careless?

36
00:02:09,587 --> 00:02:14,884
and were not caught up on little things

37
00:02:14,884 --> 00:02:24,102
What I mean when I say, “it’s okay to go but I will be bothered,” is that if I can get my lover to fall for me,

38
00:02:24,102 --> 00:02:29,440
then even if they get approached by others at the club, it should be okay.

39
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,900
- You are confident
- Yes, I’m confident

40
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:33,736
Because they’ve fallen for my charms. Your confidence is very…

41
00:02:33,736 --> 00:02:35,446
Your confidence is very…

42
00:02:35,446 --> 00:02:38,992
No, just saying that it would be good to go with firm trust in each other

43
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:40,952
Yeah, that’s nicely said

44
00:02:43,663 --> 00:02:44,122
“Spending money and time, just to see a pretty sight”

45
00:02:44,122 --> 00:02:50,587
“Spending money and time, just to see a pretty sight”
Spend vs Not spend

46
00:02:50,587 --> 00:02:52,422
I tend to spend

47
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:55,216
You tend to spend, too?

48
00:02:55,216 --> 00:02:57,302
Things that are not practical at all,

49
00:02:57,302 --> 00:03:02,098
things that have no use but are beautiful..
I’m curious if you are the type to spend money on them

50
00:03:02,098 --> 00:03:05,018
There are a lot of those. I like seeing the sunset.

51
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:07,854
Things like these are useless in some sense.

52
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:09,772
They might be considered useless, but I spend time to see these things.

53
00:03:09,772 --> 00:03:12,734
but I spend time to see these things.

54
00:03:12,734 --> 00:03:16,863
- I also like going to boutiques and looking at cute things
- Uhm

55
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:19,908
Even when eating dinner,

56
00:03:19,908 --> 00:03:22,285
- turning on pretty lights,
- Ah right

57
00:03:22,285 --> 00:03:24,579
- Lighting up candles,
- You are right

58
00:03:24,579 --> 00:03:26,331
- I think are nice
- Right

59
00:03:26,331 --> 00:03:29,042
That’s why I bought an LED candle.

60
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:30,752
I like stuff like that.

61
00:03:30,752 --> 00:03:32,170
Aren’t most people like this?

62
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:33,421
- No,
- No?

63
00:03:33,421 --> 00:03:34,964
- There are many people who aren’t like that
- Oh, really?

64
00:03:34,964 --> 00:03:37,300
- There are many people who are more practical
- Really?

65
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:38,551
- Yeah
- ...

66
00:03:38,551 --> 00:03:40,136
Okay

67
00:03:40,762 --> 00:03:42,430
Mid-inspection

68
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:44,098
- It’s already the time for mid-inspection?
- Really?

69
00:03:47,477 --> 00:03:53,024
First, she is more beautiful in person than from the video clip.

70
00:03:53,024 --> 00:03:55,693
She is also better at speaking her mind than I thought.

71
00:03:55,693 --> 00:03:58,363
Also I got a glimpse of her positivity,

72
00:03:58,363 --> 00:04:00,406
which makes our tendencies seem similar, too.

73
00:04:00,406 --> 00:04:03,701
Things seem to be better than I was worrying about

74
00:04:06,496 --> 00:04:09,958
He really seems to be a very decent person.

75
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:14,504
And when he speaks, he has a little bit of a dialect accent,

76
00:04:14,504 --> 00:04:16,881
which I found to be really cute.

77
00:04:16,881 --> 00:04:21,386
And how do I say it, he seems to be really healthy.

78
00:04:21,386 --> 00:04:24,722
His mind seems to be healthy

79
00:04:25,306 --> 00:04:26,474
-Values-

80
00:04:26,474 --> 00:04:27,517
Values...

81
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:31,312
“When an uncomfortable topic arises in a public place,”

82
00:04:31,312 --> 00:04:37,360
“When an uncomfortable topic arises in a public place,”
You move on for now vs You talk about it

83
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:40,613
I choose to move on for now

84
00:04:44,492 --> 00:04:46,286
You would want me to talk about it, right?

85
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:48,162
- I’d appreciate it if you would
- Ah

86
00:04:48,162 --> 00:04:51,249
Is there a level of sensitivity to the topic?

87
00:04:51,249 --> 00:04:54,168
Doesn’t everyone have the same level which they feel uncomfortable at?

88
00:04:54,168 --> 00:04:55,295
Actually, no, is it different?

89
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:58,756
If it’s at the level everyone feels uncomfortable in, I would discuss it too

90
00:04:58,756 --> 00:05:00,258
Have you experienced anything like it?

91
00:05:00,258 --> 00:05:03,177
That kind of experience?

92
00:05:03,177 --> 00:05:05,972
I can’t think of anything specific right now,

93
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:07,974
but when something uncomfortable comes up,

94
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:13,646
I try to at least address it jokingly by saying things like, “These days you can get arrested for saying that.”

95
00:05:13,646 --> 00:05:17,775
If it’s not that kind of situation

96
00:05:17,775 --> 00:05:22,030
and me saying something would actually bring an awkward atmosphere,

97
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:23,740
- I’d be more careful to speak up.
- Ah..

98
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:25,700
And I’d consider each relationships too.

99
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:27,618
- I’d consider everything
- Ah..

100
00:05:27,618 --> 00:05:31,247
- I am the queen of causing awkward atmospheres.
- Oh really?

101
00:05:31,247 --> 00:05:32,290
Are you upfront about it?

102
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:34,709
- Yeah, I tend to say things right away.
- You do?

103
00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:37,378
When too many things are passed by and ignored like that,

104
00:05:37,378 --> 00:05:39,464
- You are right, they might never know their faults.
- Yes

105
00:05:39,464 --> 00:05:40,673
Do you have such experiences?

106
00:05:40,673 --> 00:05:42,342
- There are a lot
- Oh really?

107
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:46,054
Stuff like that happen a lot in small situations

108
00:05:46,054 --> 00:05:49,724
But when you act that way, your image is also impacted.

109
00:05:49,724 --> 00:05:51,559
You might be viewed as someone who is always pointing things out.

110
00:05:51,559 --> 00:05:53,061
You don’t care about that?

111
00:05:53,061 --> 00:05:55,480
People probably avoid speaking up because that’s a something they care about?

112
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,690
- You right. They usually talk around...
- Yes, but....

113
00:05:57,690 --> 00:06:01,527
- But a problem is a problem
- You usually point things out right away

114
00:06:01,527 --> 00:06:06,282
And it can also come back to me as well. Those kind of words?

115
00:06:06,282 --> 00:06:07,575
I see...

116
00:06:07,575 --> 00:06:10,244
- You should point things out too
- Me?

117
00:06:10,244 --> 00:06:12,246
In a public setting?

118
00:06:12,246 --> 00:06:16,376
I may or may not, depending on the circumstances

119
00:06:19,504 --> 00:06:20,296
"More important to me"

120
00:06:20,296 --> 00:06:24,467
"More important to me"
Self-development vs Societal change

121
00:06:24,467 --> 00:06:25,134
Hm!

122
00:06:25,718 --> 00:06:27,011
I have to think about it for a bit

123
00:06:28,679 --> 00:06:31,516
I feel like you would’ve chosen societal change.

124
00:06:31,516 --> 00:06:34,352
For me, it’s self-development

125
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:40,358
- Oh, self-development?
- It’s really nice to know your answer.

126
00:06:40,358 --> 00:06:42,777
- I think it’s best for both of us to go at the same time
- Me too

127
00:06:42,777 --> 00:06:45,238
So I chose self-development.

128
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:49,158
I say individuals come first, but we should also care for the society as well.

129
00:06:49,158 --> 00:06:50,743
That’s why we should vote.

130
00:06:50,743 --> 00:06:52,245
- Yes
- This question we agreed on;

131
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:54,956
because of the previous questions, I thought you would’ve chosen societal change

132
00:06:54,956 --> 00:06:58,376
I’m the queen of causing uncomfortable situations

133
00:06:58,376 --> 00:06:59,919
and a “professional discomfort-er” (a slang for people who are easily offended) in that sense,

134
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:04,966
but I still think that I need to choose good things to fight for

135
00:07:04,966 --> 00:07:08,678
So are you saying that you are selective about things you fight for?

136
00:07:08,678 --> 00:07:10,763
It came out weird. That’s not really what I meant.

137
00:07:10,763 --> 00:07:11,889
For example,

138
00:07:11,889 --> 00:07:17,353
if uncomfortable topics came up at company or family get-togethers,

139
00:07:17,353 --> 00:07:19,522
I would point them out,

140
00:07:19,522 --> 00:07:22,692
but I’m not the type to be fighting about them online in the comments section

141
00:07:22,692 --> 00:07:25,319
because that’s too consuming for me

142
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:29,740
Then do you speak up because you want to influence those around you?

143
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:31,993
Because you think they can change?

144
00:07:31,993 --> 00:07:34,537
Not so much that I want to change them my own way,

145
00:07:34,537 --> 00:07:39,917
- but more so because their words are hurtful towards me?
- Ah right

146
00:07:39,917 --> 00:07:44,505
I’m curious about if you think that an individual’s voice can make a big impact on the society?

147
00:07:44,505 --> 00:07:48,759
Umm, I wish we could use new methods

148
00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:51,888
because I wonder if there are more effective ways to handle things.

149
00:07:51,888 --> 00:07:54,307
I think that those are issues within the structure of the society

150
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:58,436
and can be viewed as mistakes caused by ignorance.

151
00:07:58,436 --> 00:08:00,646
If those people were the type to be changed after being taught,

152
00:08:00,646 --> 00:08:03,024
they would’ve already learned from the news.

153
00:08:03,024 --> 00:08:06,110
So there needs other institutional method

154
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:09,113
or company training;

155
00:08:09,113 --> 00:08:13,284
I think it’s good for the higher powers to approach them.

156
00:08:13,284 --> 00:08:16,537
- Because if individuals dealt with them, it would cause so many fights.
- Uhm..

157
00:08:18,247 --> 00:08:19,957
That’s that

158
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:23,336
"Current attitude towards my life"

159
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:29,008
Content and happy vs Ambitious

160
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:31,344
- Did you choose?
- Yes

161
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:34,764
- For me, it’s content and happy. 
- Ah

162
00:08:37,725 --> 00:08:40,478
- I love that phrase 
- Ah, really?

163
00:08:40,478 --> 00:08:42,146
Do you make efforts to be content?

164
00:08:42,146 --> 00:08:44,607
I think I’ve always lived busily

165
00:08:44,607 --> 00:08:49,654
so I think I want my partner needs to be more relaxed

166
00:08:49,654 --> 00:08:53,157
- Oh so you want your partner to be this way
- Yes

167
00:08:53,157 --> 00:08:55,743
- Is that me? Someone who is content and happy?
- ...

168
00:08:55,743 --> 00:08:56,953
I’m sorry

169
00:08:56,953 --> 00:08:59,539
- You are full of confidence
- No, not really.

170
00:09:00,331 --> 00:09:02,917
Anyway, I try my best to be content.

171
00:09:02,917 --> 00:09:06,963
But also not to fall behind by being too content either,

172
00:09:06,963 --> 00:09:09,257
since we live in a competitive society

173
00:09:09,257 --> 00:09:11,050
- It’s okay to fall behind
- Oh really?

174
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:13,928
When I say that I like someone who is happy and content,

175
00:09:13,928 --> 00:09:17,640
I mean someone who goes, “I don’t really know (care)!” in a competitive situation

176
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:20,268
- Oh really?
- I think I like that type of person.

177
00:09:20,268 --> 00:09:24,021
. Ones who make you wonder, “is it okay to live like that?”

178
00:09:24,021 --> 00:09:27,984
Really.. I do think it’s important to have the attitude to make best efforts.

179
00:09:27,984 --> 00:09:32,321
I don’t think it’s good to give up so easily.

180
00:09:32,321 --> 00:09:34,865
Live by working hard, while being content

181
00:09:34,865 --> 00:09:38,327
Because we are always told to achieve things.

182
00:09:38,327 --> 00:09:40,037
- Especially Korea.
- Right

183
00:09:40,037 --> 00:09:45,626
I feel like when one chooses to escape that route, they are considered losers.

184
00:09:45,626 --> 00:09:51,424
But when I see people courageously choosing that, I find it to be respectable

185
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:54,719
Though it’s not easy, that is a more respectable decision

186
00:09:57,054 --> 00:09:58,222
Final decision

187
00:09:58,222 --> 00:10:00,391
- It’s already time for the final decision?
- It's already?

188
00:10:00,391 --> 00:10:02,476
- But we did talk a lot
- Yeah we did

189
00:10:05,354 --> 00:10:13,362
Interested in dating
Send an O X accordingly

190
00:10:13,362 --> 00:10:16,782
Ah, the fact that we have make a decision so quickly

191
00:10:18,576 --> 00:10:20,369
- Did you send it?
- Yes

192
00:10:20,369 --> 00:10:22,079
I sent mine too

193
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:23,414
This is so odd.

194
00:10:23,414 --> 00:10:26,208
- Because it’s with someone I don’t know anything about...
- Right

195
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:28,377
- I don’t even know your name yet.
- ... It's weird

196
00:10:28,377 --> 00:10:30,588
How was it today?

197
00:10:30,588 --> 00:10:35,301
I really came not even knowing your face and spoke to you.

198
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:38,304
It was nice

199
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:41,766
because there were variety of questions asked without any stereotypes

200
00:10:41,766 --> 00:10:44,101
and we were able to get to know each other through them.

201
00:10:44,101 --> 00:10:48,564
If I were to be given more information ahead,

202
00:10:48,564 --> 00:10:53,653
a different image would’ve been formed

203
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:56,238
Because we talked right away without even knowing each other’s names.

204
00:10:56,238 --> 00:10:58,407
It was a fun experience

205
00:10:59,825 --> 00:11:05,247
The light will turn off on the side that sent an X
