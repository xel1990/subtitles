1
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:09,900
What is most important thing to consider when dating?

2
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:12,520
I think that is more important than the appearance

3
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:15,840
My voice has been complimented well.

4
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:18,020
I was about to say.

5
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:19,460
I am very nervous.

6
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:33,300
&lt;When a man who has wide shoulder meets a tall lady&gt;

7
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:38,120
[Sung Won Joon, 32 Years Old, Businessman]
I hope to have something in common

8
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:42,080
to talk to during the blind date.

9
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:43,140
And,

10
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:45,100
It would be great if she is pretty.

11
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:47,660
Someone who is warm-hearted?

12
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:50,000
[Lee Ji Young, 27 Years Old, Teacher to-be]
I wouldn’t mind if he is younger than me.

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,420
Park Bo Gum?

14
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:58,660
I would prefer someone with more mature sense rather than young one.

15
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:01,100
Someone with pale skin tone?

16
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:02,800
and with wide shoulder

17
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,360
Park Bo Gum!

18
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:07,280
Uhm…

19
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:09,680
Hello

20
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,060
Hello

21
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:13,260
I am asking questions right?

22
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:15,380
Q. I like listening to music.

23
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:17,600
Is there any album or songs you like in particular

24
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:18,900
that you’ve listened to lately?

25
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:21,240
I like ballads.

26
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:25,300
Yoon Jong Shin just released ‘Yes’ after ‘Like it’.

27
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:26,100
Yes he released ‘Yes’.

28
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:28,300
I listen to that song day and night lately.

29
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:29,980
Have you just broken up with someone?

30
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:31,200
No I haven’t.

31
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,160
I just listen to the songs I like over and over again.

32
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:34,920
I loved the song too.

33
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:37,000
I like hip-hop.

34
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:39,440
'Yes’

35
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:41,140
‘Like it’…?

36
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:43,400
I have sang the songs and I liked it.

37
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:46,040
♪ Is it okay now

38
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:48,840
♪ You’ve been low

39
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:54,280
♪ The end to our

40
00:01:57,220 --> 00:02:00,440
Q. Is there something you wanted to with your girlfriend?

41
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:05,020
I would love to spend times with her

42
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:08,360
Q. What about doing something cultural activities together?

43
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:11,340
I would love to do it together.

44
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,720
I love going to a movie

45
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:16,660
or seeing musical or drama

46
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:17,240
Oh really?

47
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,820
Do you like going to exhibition too?

48
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:19,480
Yes

49
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:22,280
Whichever contents they are

50
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,760
I like to see them.

51
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,740
I am interested in those.

52
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:29,740
I would love to go and see those together.

53
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:32,160
Ah~ I like to hear that.

54
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:36,440
Q. Do you tend to stay indoor?

55
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:38,340
than outdoor?

56
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:41,060
If the weather is good, I tend to go out

57
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:44,060
for example, going to Hangang,

58
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:46,700
or to a beach

59
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,520
Q. How many times do you think is appropriate

60
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:55,100
to meet per week or month when dating?

61
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:58,980
Twice or thrice in a week?

62
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,420
Okay

63
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:04,080
You do not put a limit to it.

64
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:05,560
Yes.

65
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:09,620
But if the situation does not allow

66
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:12,700
only once a week? They see each other.

67
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:13,800
Yes

68
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:16,700
But if you only get to see each other during weekend, it would be sad

69
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:18,240
so if the distance allows

70
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:21,680
trying to see as many as you can is better.

71
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:22,800
Okay I see.

72
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:27,320
Q. What is most important thing to consider

73
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:30,040
when dating?

74
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,960
Warm personality.

75
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:36,140
I like someone who is caring.

76
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:38,680
Also someone I can talk to!

77
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:41,020
Those are more important things to consider than appearance.

78
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:45,260
Q. I would like to ask a similar question to that

79
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:47,960
You also have a certain thing to consider

80
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:50,360
for example type of appearance?

81
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:53,420
I do not have certain preference.

82
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:57,420
Someone who acts sweet and cute?

83
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,260
Okay

84
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:03,260
I do not think I could act cute

85
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,300
So I have not much to say about that.

86
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:09,540
Q. Are you a quiet person?

87
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:12,080
or outgoing?

88
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:15,520
I become more outgoing if I get closer to people.

89
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:20,480
I have been heard that I am much different from the first impression.

90
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:25,060
What do they say about your first impression?

91
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:27,500
Look quiet and cold?

92
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,780
They say that a lot.

93
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:34,120
Friends often told me ‘You looked so cold at first that it was hard to approach.’

94
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:37,060
‘It was hard to open a word with you.’

95
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:38,600
‘But after I get to know you,’

96
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:43,320
‘You are like my younger sister.’

97
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,240
Total reverse in first impression

98
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:52,500
Normally those who look cold are not cold

99
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,320
but actually warm hearted,

100
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,360
and those unexpected

101
00:04:57,820 --> 00:04:59,700
make them attractive.

102
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:02,840
Q. May I ask if you smoke?

103
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,920
and how much you drink?

104
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:08,380
I do not smoke.

105
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:09,800
but I drink.

106
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:12,060
Do you have a lot of gatherings?

107
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:15,540
I like to gather some closest friends

108
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:17,960
and drink not heavily.

109
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:20,580
I rather prefer to talk and drink

110
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:22,620
than to go and party.

111
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:29,060
Q. What is your favorite body part of yourself?

112
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,460
Uhm, a balance?

113
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:34,680
Balance?

114
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:38,520
I think the features are balanced.

115
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,820
Balance is important.

116
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,440
Mine?

117
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:47,280
Wide shoulder?

118
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:52,400
Q. Could you tell me your 3 strengths?

119
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,880
A question that could be asked in the job interview…

120
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,880
I am very optimistic.

121
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:03,580
My voice has been complimented well.

122
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:05,900
I was about to say.

123
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:09,500
I think that is one of my strengths.

124
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:11,900
I really liked his voice.

125
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:15,400
His voice was better than the last one.

126
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:17,800
That part, I really liked.

127
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:20,360
I was thinking of ‘Should I move forward on the next question?’

128
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:21,660
So I stopped.

129
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:23,140
Seems like I’ve moved enough already.

130
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:27,200
Q. There is a concept of ‘guy’ friend and ‘girl’ friend.

131
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:29,120
Do you keep them close?

132
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:32,600
I do not think it is impossible to keep them close.

133
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:36,240
Also seeing them alone often is not okay.

134
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:38,080
So you just keep them acquainted.

135
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:39,920
Yes, just one meal?

136
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:41,620
Just one meal

137
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:42,760
No movie together

138
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:44,560
no drink together

139
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,460
You have those limits in detail.

140
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:49,500
like one meal

141
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:50,980
Yes I do.

142
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:53,640
Q. May I ask about

143
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:55,340
your dating pattern or style?

144
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:58,280
I try to think myself as a warm person.

145
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:01,180
I try to call here frequently

146
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:05,140
That means the girlfriends

147
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:08,140
did not ask specifically about you calling back?

148
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,900
Yes. They had not.

149
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:13,880
Q. Would you consider it seriously

150
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:15,240
if you date now?

151
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:16,860
Yes.

152
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:17,980
Okay.

153
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:22,660
It is not like I have already planned on it.

154
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:26,220
I had always been serious in the previous ones.

155
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:30,720
How about you? Have you?

156
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:33,260
I have not been taking it seriously

157
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:34,720
Yet I did not start it if

158
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,540
I could not see the future with him.

159
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:40,060
I have experienced many people who think

160
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:42,660
dating and a marriage are separate things.

161
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:45,500
So I thought it is important to figure this out.

162
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:48,000
So I have been thinking

163
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:50,140
this is the most important thing to consider

164
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:51,520
before start dating.

165
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:55,020
Q. How do you feel about

166
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:57,140
long distance relationship?

167
00:07:58,340 --> 00:08:00,060
Long distance relationship means

168
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:03,720
not only seeing each other that often but also means more devotion to each other.

169
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:07,240
I do not have a certain limit on those terms.

170
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:09,900
How far from you become long distance?

171
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,680
Further than Asia?

172
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:13,980
Asia?

173
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:14,800
Yes

174
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:18,900
I live in Yongin.

175
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:23,220
I have never dated someone who lives nearby.

176
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:26,280
I moved forward as a citizen of Gyeonggi.

177
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:31,900
Q. Someone who likes you more vs. Someone whom you like more

178
00:08:32,540 --> 00:08:35,680
Which one would you choose to date?

179
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:39,440
For me, my intention is very important.

180
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:42,340
If I do not have a feeling toward him,

181
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:44,560
I do not date even if he likes me.

182
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:48,380
So those you’ve dated like you back in equal level?

183
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:51,320
You did not have a experience of imbalance?

184
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,480
Uhm…

185
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,220
I didn’t.

186
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:58,360
If I really do not have a feeling toward him, I do not date.

187
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:05,720
It seems good to me that

188
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:09,180
she has a principle in dating whom she likes.

189
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,720
I also do so I (moved forward)

190
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:14,920
I wonder how you look like.

191
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:16,660
I am nervous.

192
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:20,900
Blind-Date Finished

193
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:24,660
Now it is a time to check each other out!

194
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,760
Hello

195
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:38,820
It is awkward.

196
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:40,420
What should I say?

197
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:43,240
Did you have a certain image of me?

198
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:44,180
during conversation?

199
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:48,480
Your voice is very soft and relaxed.

200
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,000
Someone

201
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,660
with good guy look? I thought of that image.

202
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:54,460
You look warm.

203
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:56,280
Thank you.

204
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:00,820
Q. (During Blind-Date) How do you feel?
His voice was more

205
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:02,880
warm and caring

206
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,160
than that of Seung Woo.

207
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:06,360
I had a better image of him than Seung Woo.

208
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:10,220
Conversation flowed okay.

209
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:12,420
To be honest

210
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:16,000
there was not certain attraction to it though.

211
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:19,680
Q. How do you feel after checking each other out?
Good guy look

212
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:22,160
Well educated look?

213
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:25,860
She was tall.

214
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:27,660
She had pale skin tone.

215
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:30,840
She was nice looking.

216
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:33,700
Na Young

217
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:36,580
was more of my style.

218
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:37,820
to be honest

219
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:41,100
I think SW would fit me more.

220
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:44,340
His character stands out more.

221
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:45,920
I liked that side of him.
