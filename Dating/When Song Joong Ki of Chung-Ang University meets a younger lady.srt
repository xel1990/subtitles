1
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:06,560
When K-Drama ‘Goblin’ came out…

2
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:10,600
If I’ve got a time, I can go and visit everyday.

3
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:23,300
&lt;When Song Joong Ki of Chung-Ang University meets a younger lady&gt;

4
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:27,020
Q. This is your second blind-date. How do you feel?
A. Since this is my first time,

5
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:30,260
[Suh-hyeon Jung, 24 Years Old, Unemployed Graduate]
I would like to meet someone that could warm my heart through this winter.

6
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:34,960
[Hyo-yoon Nam, 25 Years Old, Undergraduate]
A. I am a bit nervous.

7
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:40,540
Q. Who do you expect to meet this time?
A. Because I was too nervous at last time,

8
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:45,720
I could not concentrate on the partner that much.

9
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:48,740
But then it means

10
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:52,740
that I was not that attracted to her. Hmm…

11
00:00:55,580 --> 00:00:57,920
I would like to meet someone,

12
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:01,080
instead of making me think, ‘What should I say?’

13
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:07,680
Making me comfortable enough to start the conversation.

14
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:11,580
Hello

15
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:13,200
Hello

16
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:16,180
He seems to have a nice voice

17
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:18,100
It was very deep.

18
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:20,360
I liked his voice.

19
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,240
First question is

20
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:27,160
Who is your celebrity look-alike?

21
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:30,900
If there is one, which part is most alike?

22
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,580
When K-Drama ‘Goblin’ came out,

23
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:36,160
people told me I and ‘Lee El’ (Korean Actress) look alike.

24
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:39,840
It was probably because I liked red lipstick.

25
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:43,100
That lip color makes me look alike with ‘Lee El’ (Korean Actress).

26
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:47,160
…’Lee El’ look alke?

27
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,200
At first time, I mentioned ‘Suzy’

28
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:54,220
As a look alike that I used to be hearing.

29
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:56,180
Because I could not think of anyone else.

30
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:59,360
But for this second time, I had decided to mention whom I really look alike.

31
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,880
It seems a bit distant from

32
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:05,740
what I was looking for in style.

33
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:10,860
What is the most important quality you look for in men

34
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:12,580
and the reason for that?

35
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:15,560
I see how I could talk to the guy,

36
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:20,460
Because if I cannot even talk to the guy, it cannot be happening.

37
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:23,460
I would like to meet someone whom I could really talk to.

38
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:28,860
I have mentioned that I do not want to meet someone

39
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:31,320
making me think, ‘What should I say?’

40
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:35,200
So in that point, I felt the same with her.

41
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:41,820
How do your friends and family describe you?

42
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:45,940
Active? With humor?

43
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,340
My friends often tell me

44
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:51,980
that I am a good friend

45
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:59,220
but not a nice person to those who are not close to me.

46
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:03,300
But I could be with humor if I like this person.

47
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:05,680
I see.

48
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:08,920
He does not seem to be nice for everyone.

49
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:12,260
I feel that it only matters when one is being good for those who are close to him.

50
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:15,600
I become more attracted to him because I felt the same.

51
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:18,460
What is your life style pattern?

52
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:21,260
I do not sleep that much.

53
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:25,520
12 Hours sleeping? I cannot sleep all day long.

54
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:30,280
I am having insomnia these days.

55
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:33,840
so I tend to stay up late and get up early.

56
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:38,060
I also have insomnia

57
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:41,380
I do not sleep much also

58
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:44,100
I also get up early even if I have stayed up late last night

59
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:47,520
So if he were not an early bird,

60
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:50,400
I am afraid that I can’t get in touch with him in the morning

61
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:52,960
Again this made me feel more attracted to him.

62
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:58,180
Which hobby would you like to try together?

63
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:02,820
If I were dating someone, I would like to visit

64
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:04,540
hot restaurants

65
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:08,540
I also want to take a picture together while visiting those restaurants

66
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:10,800
Those are the hobbies I would like to try together.

67
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:14,360
If I were dating someone, I also would like to

68
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,960
go and have good foods together.

69
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:19,480
That is one of my wishes.

70
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:24,900
If you were dating someone, which restaurant would you like to go together?

71
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,420
I would like to go to

72
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,980
this roof-top café in Itaewon.

73
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:34,580
I would like to go there with someone to have a good food in such nice place.

74
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:40,300
How many times per year would you travel together if you are dating someone?

75
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:43,780
If there is time,

76
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:45,620
I would go everyday.

77
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:47,840
Okay I see.

78
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:51,120
Do you like to drink?

79
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:55,340
If you do, do you prefer Soju or Beer?

80
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:57,620
Please tell me

81
00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:01,360
I prefer Soju over beer.

82
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:05,760
I can drink up to a bottle.

83
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:10,980
For beer, 2 glasses of draft beer

84
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:14,060
are maximum.

85
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:17,460
That is an opposite of me.

86
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:20,020
I do not prefer Soju itself

87
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:22,460
because of its too strong smell.

88
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:31,520
I prefer So-mac (Soju-beer cocktail) or Beer only.

89
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:37,080
I honestly do not drink So-mac or beer but only Soju.

90
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:38,720
He is the opposite of me.

91
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:43,280
So I stepped out once because I like to drink

92
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:48,600
meaning that we would have to order not only Soju but also beer

93
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:54,920
Which kind of outfit do you prefer?

94
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,520
Occasion to occasion,

95
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:02,180
I prefer to wear what I would like to wear.

96
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:04,800
I take extra care on how I look because I am into stylish clothing.

97
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:07,360
But I prefer not to look too out there

98
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:10,160
and wear too bright colors.

99
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:14,640
I also prefer dark colored clothing.

100
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:17,560
He told me that he also does not prefer too bright colors.

101
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:19,340
I liked that point also.

102
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:24,180
When do you feel that you fall for someone?

103
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:29,560
First impression goes a long way.

104
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:34,760
I also think the way he similes is important.

105
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:39,640
I feel it when I see the way he smiles.

106
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:43,460
I feel the same way.

107
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:46,000
I also think that first impression is important.

108
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:50,480
So if the first impression is not so good,

109
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:53,260
it does not make a good person

110
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:55,960
no matter how many times I see that person again.

111
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:58,100
I think the same way.

112
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,360
I will ask the next question.

113
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:05,660
What do you think of girl friends and guy friends?

114
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,880
How far could you go with them?

115
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:10,620
I have a guy friend.

116
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:14,540
So I would like to respect him having a girl friend.

117
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:22,520
I think it is okay for him to have a meal and go for a coffee with her,

118
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:24,960
but drinking together is absolute No.

119
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:29,560
I get really jealous.

120
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:34,020
Of course I won’t be like ‘Do not see him.’

121
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:37,740
but I would be like ‘I think it would be better if you do not see him.’

122
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:40,040
What would you do if boyfriend does that?

123
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:42,100
Uhm..

124
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:44,780
First I would hear him out.

125
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:47,080
so we wouldn’t argue.

126
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:56,500
If she agrees with me just to stop the argument,

127
00:07:56,780 --> 00:08:00,080
this will eventually become bigger argument later on.

128
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:05,180
I do not think she has thought this through when she mentioned it.

129
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:09,340
How many times do you prefer to get in touch with each other per day?

130
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:14,380
As long as it does not disturb one’s life pattern,

131
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:16,120
I would try as many as I can.

132
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:18,300
Do you prefer to talk on the phone or

133
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:20,480
send text messages or Kakaotalk (SNS Messenger) ?

134
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:22,940
Uhm

135
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:27,580
I prefer calling over Kakaotalk.

136
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:37,360
What is your ideal level of attachment to the partner?

137
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:42,140
My ideal level of attachment is pretty high.

138
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:45,120
So I like someone whom I can lean on

139
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:52,780
and I tend to focus more on the partner than friends when dating.

140
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:57,400
I would mostly spend my time on work and the partner.

141
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:02,480
If I were dating someone, I mostly spend my time meeting my partner.

142
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:07,760
I always think of seeing her as top priority in my schedule.

143
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:12,740
Blind-Date Finished

144
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,800
Now it is a time to check each other out!

145
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,220
Hello

146
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,640
What should I say?

147
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:51,800
You do look like ‘Lee El’

148
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:52,480
I do?

149
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,120
Yes you do.

150
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,520
Q. (During Blind-Date) How do you feel? 
When I only hear his voice,

151
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,940
I felt that he would be mannish, and much older.

152
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:05,400
But as soon as I saw his face, he looked much younger.

153
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:10,660
Before I see her face to face, I thought of her as much subtle character.

154
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,320
But she was very dressed up in person.

155
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:17,840
Q. After checking each other out, how was it?
He was what I have expected.

156
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:20,220
because I could talk to him.

157
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:22,080
I could really talk to him.

158
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:26,080
His mannish voice escalated my expectation.

159
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,660
I liked him when I saw him.

160
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:30,180
First I thought her dating style

161
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:36,220
was very similar to mine.

162
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:42,660
but then her dating style and characters made me feel

163
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:46,920
more close to her.
