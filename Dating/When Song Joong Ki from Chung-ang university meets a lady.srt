89
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:34,060
[Min Jung]
"After hearing his answers I moved because we have a lot in common
so I thought we could really hit it off "

[Hyo Yun]
"What will you do?"

97
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:15,100
[Min Jung]
"Then I won’t."

98
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:20,180

105
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:20,520
[Min Jung]
"I wanted to be more active but"

106
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:25,060
[Min Jung]
"he said he didn’t like extrovertish person in the beginning."

107
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:29,100
[Min Jung]
"So I acted introvert which I regret…."

108
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:34,260

"Even though it was different with what I thought I still liked it."

113
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:55,320
[Hyo Yun]
"When we faced each other I thought she was very pretty."

114
00:09:55,320 --> 00:10:00,460
[Hyo Yun]
"Although she wasn’t 100% my type just by seeing her"

115
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:08,520
[Hyo Yun]
"but wanted to get to know more about her."
