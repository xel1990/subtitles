00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,920
KYDS Sub

2
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:11,800
The dads are watching. My Daughters' Men Season 4!

3
00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:15,048
We're already on our 12th episode now.

4
00:00:15,189 --> 00:00:19,564
We've become attached to the dads but also to their daughters and their dates.

5
00:00:19,589 --> 00:00:22,751
I'm already sad because we don't have much time left.

6
00:00:22,806 --> 00:00:24,206
Time went by so fast.

7
00:00:24,666 --> 00:00:28,978
And stop trying to hook me up with So-Jin on this show.

8
00:00:29,986 --> 00:00:30,986
For real--

9
00:00:31,017 --> 00:00:32,923
So-Jin wrote me a letter!

10
00:00:33,205 --> 00:00:35,321
- Hee-chul!
- Hold on!

11
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:38,470
- That's not what it's about!
- Hold on!

12
00:00:38,548 --> 00:00:41,259
Hold on before you talk about the letter.

13
00:00:41,377 --> 00:00:43,595
It's supposed to be a secret letter.

14
00:00:43,642 --> 00:00:46,485
Dear lovely Hee-chul, Merry Christmas.

15
00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:48,043
Oh, it's for Christmas.

16
00:00:48,064 --> 00:00:51,131
I'm very happy and joyful because you're here.

17
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:53,846
It's not like that.

18
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:58,228
I'll pray that we'll always be happy and peaceful together.

19
00:00:58,595 --> 00:01:01,868
Let's have a warm winter together Hee-chul.

20
00:01:02,525 --> 00:01:03,525
What?

21
00:01:03,650 --> 00:01:05,048
Your face is red.

22
00:01:05,259 --> 00:01:06,423
It's really not like that.

23
00:01:06,439 --> 00:01:08,706
"Today is out 103rd day together."

24
00:01:10,275 --> 00:01:13,251
It's already been 103 days?
That means it's been past 3 months.

25
00:01:13,276 --> 00:01:14,423
We're secretly dating.

26
00:01:14,448 --> 00:01:18,115
And isn't this what people used to say a long time ago?

27
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:20,001
A lipstick mark.

28
00:01:20,814 --> 00:01:23,017
People used to do it a long time ago.

29
00:01:23,306 --> 00:01:25,001
What does it say at the bottom?

30
00:01:25,026 --> 00:01:28,025
The thing at the bottom?
You're going to say it out loud?

31
00:01:28,056 --> 00:01:29,856
"You better take care of me."

32
00:01:30,955 --> 00:01:33,985
That made this whole thing sound like a lie.

33
00:01:34,017 --> 00:01:36,064
You ruined it!

34
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:41,478
So there's no misunderstanding, So-Jin wrote all of the MCs a letter.

35
00:01:41,503 --> 00:01:42,898
- Yes.
- That's right.

36
00:01:42,953 --> 00:01:46,890
Since we've read So-jin's letter,
we should read the daughter's text too.

37
00:01:46,938 --> 00:01:49,338
- Yes.
- Let's hurry up and see it.

38
00:01:52,086 --> 00:01:54,976
- What does it say?
- What a perfect timing for this text.

39
00:01:55,047 --> 00:01:56,968
- This is perfect.
- Yes.

40
00:01:57,031 --> 00:01:58,664
Look me in the eyes.

41
00:01:59,047 --> 00:02:00,750
I got a feeling that you're my partner.

42
00:02:00,797 --> 00:02:02,843
"Dear lovely Hee-chul..."

43
00:02:04,344 --> 00:02:05,562
Stop it!

44
00:02:05,758 --> 00:02:07,257
You're teasing us.

45
00:02:07,406 --> 00:02:09,984
Partner means like school partner right?

46
00:02:10,009 --> 00:02:11,882
- Or odd or even.
- Odd or even?

47
00:02:13,695 --> 00:02:15,664
Doesn't that mean she went on a blind date?

48
00:02:15,703 --> 00:02:16,984
It's Woo-ju.

49
00:02:17,047 --> 00:02:20,578
- She should be going on a new blind date.
- Right.

50
00:02:20,688 --> 00:02:21,812
You're right.

51
00:02:22,688 --> 00:02:24,085
It's Joo-yeon.

52
00:02:24,258 --> 00:02:27,304
Maybe Joo-yeon did a parody of something.

53
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:29,101
Let's watch the clip.

54
00:02:29,234 --> 00:02:30,617
I'm curious.

55
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,750
- Is it a temple?
- Where is that?

56
00:02:35,172 --> 00:02:38,007
- Is it a folk village?
- It's a folk village.

57
00:02:38,032 --> 00:02:39,025
Who is it?

58
00:02:39,050 --> 00:02:41,007
I told you it was Woo-ju.

59
00:02:41,766 --> 00:02:43,953
Why is she going all over the place?

60
00:02:43,978 --> 00:02:45,570
She's off to find a new partner.

61
00:02:45,594 --> 00:02:47,718
I thought it'd be Joo-yeon.

62
00:02:56,977 --> 00:02:59,117
Hello. Nice to meet you.

63
00:03:02,609 --> 00:03:04,023
Is that him?

64
00:03:04,164 --> 00:03:06,820
What is such a beautiful woman doing in our village?

65
00:03:07,695 --> 00:03:08,945
It's a deer?

66
00:03:09,719 --> 00:03:12,820
What is such a beautiful woman doing in our village?

67
00:03:12,844 --> 00:03:14,953
- Hello.
- Nice to meet you.

68
00:03:15,602 --> 00:03:17,135
Is that her blind date?

69
00:03:17,648 --> 00:03:19,582
- Nice to meet you.
- Hello.

70
00:03:20,211 --> 00:03:21,914
Your hands are cold.

71
00:03:22,281 --> 00:03:24,132
I picked this up on the way.

72
00:03:24,141 --> 00:03:25,141
Thank you.

73
00:03:25,258 --> 00:03:26,734
What brings you here?

74
00:03:26,789 --> 00:03:30,056
Oh he's talking in an accent because he's a deer.

75
00:03:31,070 --> 00:03:35,070
There are a lot of different characters at the folk village.

76
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:37,062
Why did I come here?

77
00:03:37,367 --> 00:03:39,820
- I came for a blind date.
- A blind date?

78
00:03:39,969 --> 00:03:42,085
So I'd like to formally introduce myself.

79
00:03:42,179 --> 00:03:43,437
No way!

80
00:03:43,570 --> 00:03:45,370
The deer is her blind date?

81
00:03:47,031 --> 00:03:48,039
Hello.

82
00:03:48,304 --> 00:03:49,704
A blind date...

83
00:03:50,070 --> 00:03:51,851
He's going on a date looking like that?

84
00:03:51,876 --> 00:03:55,390
I wish I could be your date.
Is it not possible?

85
00:03:56,219 --> 00:03:58,968
- What a funny guy.
- I was flustered.

86
00:04:02,062 --> 00:04:03,703
Could I come in for a second?

87
00:04:03,711 --> 00:04:05,828
He sounds like Lee Sun-gyun!

88
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:08,921
"One vongole pasta..."

89
00:04:10,438 --> 00:04:11,960
Could I come in for a second?

90
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,375
Sure.

91
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:21,828
It is you, huh?

92
00:04:21,969 --> 00:04:24,171
- Is it the deer?
- Is it Lee Sun-gyun?

93
00:04:24,211 --> 00:04:25,678
It really must be him!

94
00:04:28,999 --> 00:04:30,117
It is you, huh?

95
00:04:30,227 --> 00:04:31,632
It is the deer.

96
00:04:32,422 --> 00:04:33,710
For real?

97
00:04:34,053 --> 00:04:36,734
I had no idea he'd be her blind date.

98
00:04:37,195 --> 00:04:39,164
I'm your blind date.

99
00:04:39,523 --> 00:04:40,359
Really?

100
00:04:40,399 --> 00:04:43,360
Oh, he doesn't usually play the deer character.

101
00:04:43,782 --> 00:04:45,000
Hello.

102
00:04:45,876 --> 00:04:46,938
I'm lying.

103
00:04:47,289 --> 00:04:48,610
What the heck?

104
00:04:50,586 --> 00:04:52,253
Were you going to hit me?

105
00:04:52,282 --> 00:04:55,930
I'm just trying to loosen you up because you look nervous.

106
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:58,428
- I'll go get him right now.
- Okay.

107
00:05:00,344 --> 00:05:02,055
- Hold on.
- Okay.

108
00:05:07,749 --> 00:05:09,549
He's here. The door opened.

109
00:05:12,155 --> 00:05:13,256
Hello.

110
00:05:16,536 --> 00:05:18,004
His last name is Song!

111
00:05:18,327 --> 00:05:20,394
He has a nice first impression!

112
00:05:20,819 --> 00:05:22,967
- Hello.
- Hello.

113
00:05:23,179 --> 00:05:26,022
You look prettier in person.

114
00:05:26,092 --> 00:05:27,692
He said that right away.

115
00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:28,850
He's handsome.

116
00:05:28,951 --> 00:05:31,827
- You look even better in real life.
- No I don't.

117
00:05:33,585 --> 00:05:35,967
Let me first introduce myself.

118
00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:40,077
I'm Song Ki-ho and I'm the CEO of an interior design company.

119
00:05:40,102 --> 00:05:41,905
An interior design company!

120
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:44,592
- They're Song and Song couple!
- You're right!

121
00:05:44,686 --> 00:05:45,686
Double Song.

122
00:05:45,710 --> 00:05:48,100
Like Song Hye-gyo and Song Joong-ki!

123
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:49,920
Like Song Hye-gyo and Song Joong-ki!

124
00:05:49,976 --> 00:05:51,881
Song Ki-ho and Song Woo-ju.

125
00:05:51,906 --> 00:05:55,280
- What do you think about him?
- I really like his first impression.

126
00:05:55,335 --> 00:05:58,866
- He has a genius side.
- Yeah, he looks smart.

127
00:05:58,968 --> 00:06:01,154
It's probably because he's a Song.

128
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:07,936
I'm Song Woo-ju and I'm a college student.

129
00:06:08,061 --> 00:06:12,452
I saw you eating on the show.

130
00:06:12,522 --> 00:06:15,342
- He has a really nice voice.
- He does have a nice voice.

131
00:06:15,367 --> 00:06:16,679
He looks very smart.

132
00:06:16,718 --> 00:06:18,483
You're close to my ideal type of woman.

133
00:06:18,522 --> 00:06:19,623
- Really?
- Yes.

134
00:06:19,710 --> 00:06:20,710
Thank you.

135
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:24,147
How old are you?

136
00:06:27,101 --> 00:06:28,670
How old do I look?

137
00:06:28,913 --> 00:06:31,522
28 or 29?

138
00:06:31,569 --> 00:06:32,631
- 28 or 29?
- Yes.

139
00:06:32,663 --> 00:06:33,936
We're the same age.

140
00:06:36,403 --> 00:06:37,388
Really?

141
00:06:37,663 --> 00:06:39,327
Nice to meet you, friend!

142
00:06:39,436 --> 00:06:40,827
We're the same age.

143
00:06:40,998 --> 00:06:45,569
Our last names are both Song,
and we have a lot of similarities.

144
00:06:48,147 --> 00:06:50,975
What's are your hobbies or special talents?

145
00:06:50,999 --> 00:06:53,066
Is it too boring of a question?

146
00:06:53,897 --> 00:06:56,584
- I like listening to music and drawing.
- Really?

147
00:06:57,351 --> 00:06:58,884
That's similar to mine.

148
00:06:59,124 --> 00:07:03,647
- I listen to jazz or RnB pop.
- Jazz and pop!

149
00:07:04,053 --> 00:07:06,358
- Do you know HONNE?
- Of course.

150
00:07:06,647 --> 00:07:09,819
The music taste has to match well.

151
00:07:09,882 --> 00:07:13,623
And matching tastes are important for Woo-ju.

152
00:07:13,866 --> 00:07:16,733
- Aren't they really good?
- They're amazing.

153
00:07:16,758 --> 00:07:18,350
I practiced piano because of HONNE.

154
00:07:18,375 --> 00:07:20,702
- Their song is amazing on a rainy day.
- Yes.

155
00:07:20,757 --> 00:07:23,217
Excuse me.

156
00:07:23,304 --> 00:07:25,637
- The deer is here again.
- Hello.

157
00:07:26,054 --> 00:07:30,217
Here is your order of black herbal tea and Shiquan Dabo tea.

158
00:07:30,662 --> 00:07:33,061
- First...
- That's dried ginger, right?

159
00:07:33,311 --> 00:07:36,428
- You know about them?
- I bought a bunch on home shopping.

160
00:07:36,468 --> 00:07:38,483
- It's good.
- It's really good for your body.

161
00:07:38,507 --> 00:07:39,233
Right.

162
00:07:39,257 --> 00:07:40,803
It's good for your throat.

163
00:07:40,952 --> 00:07:42,685
Have a good time together.

164
00:07:44,819 --> 00:07:46,413
Yes, please leave.

165
00:07:48,850 --> 00:07:52,545
- A man shouldn't slouch his shoulders.
- He's sitting right there.

166
00:07:53,788 --> 00:07:56,100
You'd be intruding if you stay too long.

167
00:07:56,686 --> 00:07:58,991
- I have to go.
- He's witty.

168
00:07:59,351 --> 00:08:00,551
He can play along.

169
00:08:00,788 --> 00:08:03,764
Let me say one last thing before I leave.

170
00:08:04,083 --> 00:08:06,084
Please put background music to this.

171
00:08:08,491 --> 00:08:10,600
She can't drink too much.

172
00:08:10,694 --> 00:08:14,108
He must've watched our show too.

173
00:08:14,397 --> 00:08:19,225
So I hope you'll serve her tea instead of drinks today.

174
00:08:23,858 --> 00:08:25,288
Please be happy!

175
00:08:26,507 --> 00:08:27,889
Good bye.

176
00:08:28,811 --> 00:08:31,381
I was excited to see characters like him--

177
00:08:31,452 --> 00:08:33,061
And...

178
00:08:33,086 --> 00:08:34,178
He keeps coming back.

179
00:08:34,210 --> 00:08:35,866
I'm sorry to interrupt.

180
00:08:36,045 --> 00:08:38,748
But it's your guys' blind date today.

181
00:08:38,913 --> 00:08:44,538
So the folk village has prepared hanboks for you guys so you can have a fun date.

182
00:08:44,679 --> 00:08:46,319
There are a lot of events there.

183
00:08:46,382 --> 00:08:47,782
You look happier now.

184
00:08:47,869 --> 00:08:49,602
That was a little helpful.

185
00:08:49,627 --> 00:08:57,655
You can make beautiful memories if you go around the village in hanbok.

186
00:08:58,007 --> 00:08:59,407
I'll leave them here.

187
00:09:00,202 --> 00:09:01,405
Please be happy.

188
00:09:03,226 --> 00:09:05,139
The deer is playing the matchmaker.

189
00:09:05,164 --> 00:09:06,343
He is.

190
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:11,900
- Shall we go out to look around now?
- Yes.

191
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:22,740
If it's the deer again, I'm going to...
No.

192
00:09:22,758 --> 00:09:23,905
He looks good.

193
00:09:24,428 --> 00:09:26,028
He looks good in hanbok.

194
00:09:26,053 --> 00:09:28,520
- It's not easy to look good in hanbok.
- Seriously.

195
00:09:28,545 --> 00:09:30,303
He's the type that parents like.

196
00:09:30,328 --> 00:09:32,233
- I'm excited to see Woo-ju.
- Yes.

197
00:09:40,772 --> 00:09:42,123
She looks pretty.

198
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:44,116
How pretty.

199
00:09:44,421 --> 00:09:46,061
She looks like a fairy.

200
00:09:46,608 --> 00:09:47,942
You're so beautiful.

201
00:09:49,890 --> 00:09:53,498
Ki-ho fell in love after seeing Woo-ju in hanbok.

202
00:09:54,632 --> 00:09:57,170
- His eyes were full of hearts.
- He looks like he's in bliss.

203
00:09:57,195 --> 00:10:00,389
- He looked like he was in love.
- She's his woman in that moment.

204
00:10:00,421 --> 00:10:01,975
She looks really good in hanbok.

205
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,933
She looks good in that color.

206
00:10:05,436 --> 00:10:07,561
- You're so pretty.
- No I'm not.

207
00:10:07,796 --> 00:10:09,795
- It looks really good on you.
- No...

208
00:10:09,827 --> 00:10:10,959
- Shall we go?
- Yes.

209
00:10:10,984 --> 00:10:14,147
- Have you seen Woo-ju in hanbok?
- Is it your first time?

210
00:10:14,172 --> 00:10:15,172
Yeah.

211
00:10:15,197 --> 00:10:18,780
- Doesn't she wear one on holidays?
- People don't do that these days.

212
00:10:20,702 --> 00:10:24,327
- I was worried it might be cold.
- It looks like a historical drama.

213
00:10:24,452 --> 00:10:26,718
The folk village is really pretty.

214
00:10:26,827 --> 00:10:29,155
Am I speaking in a dialect?

215
00:10:29,841 --> 00:10:31,342
- No.
- Really?

216
00:10:31,367 --> 00:10:32,858
Are you trying to be polite?

217
00:10:32,883 --> 00:10:33,998
You're not.

218
00:10:34,515 --> 00:10:36,373
- I'm not?
- No.

219
00:10:37,101 --> 00:10:38,101
You're good.

220
00:10:38,272 --> 00:10:39,272
Thanks.

221
00:10:39,311 --> 00:10:43,225
- They're speaking in causal tones.
- Ki-ho speaks in a dialect.

222
00:10:45,436 --> 00:10:47,123
Isn't that a swing?

223
00:10:48,389 --> 00:10:49,755
It's been a while.

224
00:10:50,343 --> 00:10:53,436
You need to be careful getting on.
Let me help you.

225
00:10:57,265 --> 00:11:00,665
You have to wear a swing when getting on that hanbok.

226
00:11:00,694 --> 00:11:02,913
Wear a swing when getting on a hanbok?

227
00:11:03,265 --> 00:11:06,798
You have to wear a hanbok when getting on that swing.

228
00:11:09,585 --> 00:11:13,225
They look like Chun-hyang and Mong-ryong on a date.

229
00:11:13,374 --> 00:11:14,655
This is fun.

230
00:11:16,397 --> 00:11:18,577
You look like a painting.

231
00:11:18,679 --> 00:11:21,569
He really likes her. He said she looks like a painting.

232
00:11:21,623 --> 00:11:23,467
Do you really mean that?

233
00:11:24,030 --> 00:11:25,564
You really look pretty.

234
00:11:27,741 --> 00:11:29,008
This is really fun.

235
00:11:29,163 --> 00:11:31,830
It will be dangerous if you go too high.

236
00:11:33,139 --> 00:11:34,850
You're going high.

237
00:11:36,577 --> 00:11:39,044
He's never been on that swing before.

238
00:11:39,093 --> 00:11:40,626
He's falling backwards.

239
00:11:40,772 --> 00:11:44,506
His neck must be hurting from staring at Woo-ju so much.

240
00:11:45,265 --> 00:11:48,265
We might do a full spin if we focus too much.

241
00:11:57,124 --> 00:11:59,686
What are such shabby people doing in a fancy place--

242
00:11:59,711 --> 00:12:00,711
Is it the deer?

243
00:12:00,736 --> 00:12:03,397
What are such fancy people doing at a shabby place like this?

244
00:12:03,436 --> 00:12:05,850
There must be different characters there.

245
00:12:05,976 --> 00:12:09,272
You look like you've been dating for a year.

246
00:12:13,053 --> 00:12:14,397
He's a goblin.

247
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:18,123
This is good.

248
00:12:18,390 --> 00:12:20,459
This is called odd or even.

249
00:12:22,568 --> 00:12:23,834
I was right!

250
00:12:24,319 --> 00:12:25,522
This is crazy!

251
00:12:25,639 --> 00:12:28,717
This is where the text came from?
No way!

252
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:31,006
I have coins in this hand.

253
00:12:31,116 --> 00:12:33,209
Do you think it's an odd or even number?

254
00:12:33,241 --> 00:12:34,308
Please shake it.

255
00:12:34,436 --> 00:12:35,506
Shake it?

256
00:12:40,491 --> 00:12:42,327
Look me in the eyes.

257
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:43,787
Is it odd?

258
00:12:50,311 --> 00:12:52,045
I got a feeling it's even.

259
00:12:54,757 --> 00:12:57,553
Why did you make us get all excited?

260
00:12:57,710 --> 00:12:59,310
It feels like it's even.

261
00:12:59,335 --> 00:13:00,819
You got a feeling?

262
00:13:02,022 --> 00:13:04,631
You and I are partners from now on.

263
00:13:06,702 --> 00:13:10,194
But if it's an odd number...

264
00:13:10,219 --> 00:13:11,334
If it's an odd number...

265
00:13:11,436 --> 00:13:13,103
Ki-ho will be left alone.

266
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:17,522
We'll shoot the show together without him.

267
00:13:17,694 --> 00:13:22,084
If they lose, Woo-ju's blind date will switch to that goblin.

268
00:13:23,077 --> 00:13:24,264
Are you ready?

269
00:13:24,358 --> 00:13:26,686
- I'll reveal it right now.
- I'll trust her this time too.

270
00:13:26,749 --> 00:13:28,913
- You do?
- Don't be like that.

271
00:13:29,132 --> 00:13:32,397
Didn't anyone tell you to be careful of who you trust?

272
00:13:32,593 --> 00:13:35,803
- You'll learn today.
- It's fine.

273
00:13:35,952 --> 00:13:37,928
- Will you go with even?
- I'll go with even.

274
00:13:38,046 --> 00:13:40,113
You guys pick even, I pick odd.

275
00:13:40,522 --> 00:13:42,295
Let me open my hand.

276
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:45,053
Woo-ju must be so anxious.

277
00:13:47,858 --> 00:13:49,889
- It's odd.
- It's even.

278
00:13:59,319 --> 00:14:01,053
What does that laugh mean?

279
00:14:01,132 --> 00:14:02,665
Did he make it be even?

280
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:07,858
It's odd.

281
00:14:11,718 --> 00:14:13,420
- It's even.
- What is it?

282
00:14:13,476 --> 00:14:15,998
- It's even!
- How is this even?

283
00:14:16,085 --> 00:14:17,866
- It's even!
- How is this even?

284
00:14:17,952 --> 00:14:21,084
That's right. You and I are together now.

285
00:14:23,092 --> 00:14:25,741
- He's stopping him.
- How cute.

286
00:14:26,412 --> 00:14:27,788
Then you're...

287
00:14:29,873 --> 00:14:31,983
- It's even!
- You take this and leave.

288
00:14:32,008 --> 00:14:33,584
All right, from now on--

289
00:14:33,663 --> 00:14:37,663
It's nice to meet you. I'm the new blind date on "My Daughters' Men."

290
00:14:37,741 --> 00:14:40,208
I'm the goblin from the folk village.

291
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:43,498
The folk village look fun.

292
00:14:43,522 --> 00:14:45,389
It's changed since our time.

293
00:14:45,624 --> 00:14:47,295
They got close fast.

294
00:14:47,429 --> 00:14:48,764
They got close real fast.

295
00:14:48,811 --> 00:14:52,147
They took the advantage that being the same age gives.

296
00:14:52,172 --> 00:14:54,038
I think they both like each other.

297
00:14:54,147 --> 00:14:56,186
The age is perfect.

298
00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:00,440
It feels like we're going to get a second Song and Song couple.

299
00:15:00,772 --> 00:15:02,756
- Let's go in here.
- Okay.

300
00:15:05,819 --> 00:15:08,280
- The floors are toasty.
- They are.

301
00:15:08,601 --> 00:15:11,934
There are a lot of places with toast floors today.

302
00:15:13,608 --> 00:15:17,069
I saw that you eat a lot on the show.

303
00:15:17,795 --> 00:15:22,178
I saw the part where you tied your hair and eat.

304
00:15:22,226 --> 00:15:23,226
Did you?

305
00:15:23,554 --> 00:15:25,889
- It was very attractive.
- Really?

306
00:15:25,991 --> 00:15:29,038
It's obvious on Ki-ho's face that he likes Woo-ju a lot.

307
00:15:29,116 --> 00:15:31,319
He said she looks pretty when she eats.

308
00:15:31,358 --> 00:15:34,686
People say that but when they really see me eat,

309
00:15:34,819 --> 00:15:37,967
they think I eat very messy.

310
00:15:37,991 --> 00:15:38,991
No, no.

311
00:15:39,163 --> 00:15:41,623
He looks like he fell for her.

312
00:15:42,015 --> 00:15:43,015
He looks kind.

313
00:15:43,124 --> 00:15:45,569
They call it "talking" these days.

314
00:15:45,632 --> 00:15:46,842
That's right.

315
00:15:47,101 --> 00:15:50,772
How long do you "talk" to someone for?

316
00:15:51,202 --> 00:15:55,311
I think the number of times we meet is more important Thant the time length.

317
00:15:55,413 --> 00:16:00,741
Meeting 3 times over 3 weeks is different than meeting 10 times over 2 weeks.

318
00:16:00,991 --> 00:16:01,991
She's right.

319
00:16:02,265 --> 00:16:05,420
I think on an average, about a month.

320
00:16:05,483 --> 00:16:07,417
I get to know someone slowly.

321
00:16:09,772 --> 00:16:11,772
So we need to meet often.

322
00:16:15,905 --> 00:16:20,647
Can't you just start dating right away if first dates go well?

323
00:16:20,672 --> 00:16:23,553
- I don't think the time is important.
- Yeah.

324
00:16:23,718 --> 00:16:27,819
I think within a minimum of 5 dates...

325
00:16:28,194 --> 00:16:32,155
Jae-young, did you have a "talking" stage when you were younger?

326
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:36,631
Yeah, but first impressions were important for us.

327
00:16:36,710 --> 00:16:40,100
That lasts a really long time.

328
00:16:40,186 --> 00:16:41,853
It determines everything.

329
00:16:41,882 --> 00:16:46,194
I think it lasted all the way to marriage.

330
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:49,514
But the guy has to like the girl more.

331
00:16:49,553 --> 00:16:50,897
That's right.

332
00:16:51,155 --> 00:16:52,920
You share my theory.

333
00:16:53,061 --> 00:16:54,272
It has to be like that.

334
00:16:54,319 --> 00:16:57,386
It's a slang that young people use these days.

335
00:16:57,538 --> 00:16:59,584
But the "talking" stage is the most fun.

336
00:16:59,609 --> 00:17:02,131
- The excitement...
- And then move on to someone else.

337
00:17:02,156 --> 00:17:04,289
That's how they get to your age.

338
00:17:05,827 --> 00:17:08,506
What's wrong with my age?

339
00:17:09,210 --> 00:17:13,241
It's a perfect age for falling in love.

340
00:17:17,866 --> 00:17:20,233
I love marinated crabs.

341
00:17:20,601 --> 00:17:22,764
Woo-ju likes marinated crabs.

342
00:17:22,897 --> 00:17:25,272
It's hard to eat that on your blind date.

343
00:17:25,297 --> 00:17:27,373
People usually don't because you have to suck on them.

344
00:17:27,429 --> 00:17:30,178
You do and the smell lingers.

345
00:17:32,179 --> 00:17:34,983
- Some time has passed now.
- Right.

346
00:17:35,085 --> 00:17:37,748
Could we use the informal tone now?

347
00:17:37,788 --> 00:17:38,772
Of course.

348
00:17:39,179 --> 00:17:40,179
Yes.

349
00:17:40,561 --> 00:17:42,264
I'll start first.

350
00:17:42,490 --> 00:17:43,537
Okay.

351
00:17:44,334 --> 00:17:45,334
You're chill.

352
00:17:46,655 --> 00:17:48,405
- Shall we eat?
- Let's eat.

353
00:17:50,132 --> 00:17:52,498
You look like you're having fun.

354
00:17:56,053 --> 00:17:58,655
You've got to eat the crabs with your hands.

355
00:17:59,327 --> 00:18:02,764
You know you have to suck on them, right?

356
00:18:03,163 --> 00:18:04,459
Of course.

357
00:18:06,335 --> 00:18:07,668
You know how to eat.

358
00:18:07,866 --> 00:18:10,077
Look at his neck bone!

359
00:18:10,351 --> 00:18:13,817
I'm sorry but I have to eat that for dinner tonight.

360
00:18:14,045 --> 00:18:16,312
Tonight's menu is marinated crabs.

361
00:18:17,084 --> 00:18:20,884
I can't believe I get to watch your mukbang in real life.

362
00:18:27,569 --> 00:18:30,248
Woo-ju doesn't act coy.
That's why I like her.

363
00:18:30,273 --> 00:18:31,273
Yeah.

364
00:18:31,298 --> 00:18:33,819
I don't like it when girls go, "Oh my."

365
00:18:33,835 --> 00:18:35,616
She eats a lot and looks pretty doing it.

366
00:18:35,694 --> 00:18:36,694
This is good.

367
00:18:39,288 --> 00:18:46,405
Let's squeeze out the meat and mix it with the rice.

368
00:18:46,772 --> 00:18:49,405
- She knows how to eat it.
- Of course she does.

369
00:18:50,710 --> 00:18:51,920
Yeah.

370
00:18:56,319 --> 00:18:57,748
That's it!

371
00:19:00,835 --> 00:19:03,475
We used to mix it in the shell.

372
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:04,500
That's it.

373
00:19:05,194 --> 00:19:08,241
- I'm getting annoyed.
- That's a lot for two people.

374
00:19:08,249 --> 00:19:09,569
That looks so good.

375
00:19:09,702 --> 00:19:12,295
It's so good when you mix it with the rice.

376
00:19:12,476 --> 00:19:13,476
It's the best.

377
00:19:13,501 --> 00:19:15,350
And you top it off with seaweed--

378
00:19:15,515 --> 00:19:17,084
Yes, there you go!

379
00:19:19,006 --> 00:19:20,569
That's what I'm talking about.

380
00:19:20,632 --> 00:19:24,068
- You're supposed to put the rice in there.
- That's right.

381
00:19:39,218 --> 00:19:41,018
This is the best side dish.

382
00:19:41,279 --> 00:19:42,763
Who said this was okay?

383
00:19:43,616 --> 00:19:45,256
She's joking around.

384
00:19:45,429 --> 00:19:48,362
Her sense of humor is the same as her dad's.

385
00:19:48,694 --> 00:19:49,889
She's cute.

386
00:19:50,101 --> 00:19:54,567
I always say "Stop crabbing around"
whenever I eat crabs with her.

387
00:19:55,647 --> 00:19:57,295
We're really enjoying this.

388
00:19:57,304 --> 00:19:58,837
We finished it already.

389
00:19:59,358 --> 00:20:01,558
I really like that you eat a lot.

390
00:20:01,624 --> 00:20:07,006
I stop myself when the other person doesn't eat as much as me.

391
00:20:08,413 --> 00:20:10,880
I guess you don't gain weight though.

392
00:20:11,366 --> 00:20:12,663
I exercise a lot.

393
00:20:12,741 --> 00:20:14,475
He looks like he does too.

394
00:20:14,788 --> 00:20:16,388
I should learn from you.

395
00:20:19,435 --> 00:20:21,733
- They cleared it.
- Who said it was too much food?

396
00:20:21,758 --> 00:20:24,225
- You can't help yourself.
- They inhaled it.

397
00:20:24,304 --> 00:20:28,699
- I should eat marinated crabs tonight.
- They're really good.

398
00:20:29,442 --> 00:20:33,793
There are some forbidden foods for first dates.

399
00:20:33,818 --> 00:20:36,606
That's right there's a forbidden list of food for first dates.

400
00:20:36,684 --> 00:20:40,818
Things that get stuck in your teeth or make your breath smell.

401
00:20:41,333 --> 00:20:46,848
So I was worried that this would be considered a forbidden food.

402
00:20:47,317 --> 00:20:49,784
How did you feel when I suggested it?

403
00:20:50,286 --> 00:20:52,918
I was really happy.

404
00:20:54,364 --> 00:20:55,207
That's good.

405
00:20:55,309 --> 00:20:59,137
What would you say if the guy suggested getting marinated crabs?

406
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:01,535
I'd like it.

407
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:05,723
What's the most memorable first date food?

408
00:21:05,911 --> 00:21:09,723
We had lamb together, and I really liked it.

409
00:21:09,762 --> 00:21:11,653
- What about you?
- I had jajangmyeon.

410
00:21:11,708 --> 00:21:13,098
I had chicken soup.

411
00:21:13,192 --> 00:21:15,168
I met her through work so we had packed lunches.

412
00:21:15,176 --> 00:21:16,510
We had chicken ribs.

413
00:21:16,535 --> 00:21:17,868
We had seafood stew.

414
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:19,606
We had boiled dumplings.

415
00:21:19,631 --> 00:21:20,770
How cute.

416
00:21:21,083 --> 00:21:22,801
The fact that he remembers that...

417
00:21:22,848 --> 00:21:24,410
It somehow suits him.

418
00:21:27,403 --> 00:21:29,936
- Everyone remembers it.
- Of course.

419
00:21:34,536 --> 00:21:36,069
That's Cheonggye creek.

420
00:21:36,958 --> 00:21:39,160
I heard famous artists make those.

421
00:21:39,185 --> 00:21:41,285
It looks a lot prettier in winter.

422
00:21:41,310 --> 00:21:43,082
That's pretty!

423
00:21:45,207 --> 00:21:51,074
Wow, I think they made that out of cloth, right?

424
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:53,811
Should we take a picture?

425
00:21:53,848 --> 00:21:55,012
- Do you want to?
- Yes.

426
00:21:55,090 --> 00:21:57,379
- Want me to take it for you?
- Are you good?

427
00:21:57,411 --> 00:21:58,411
I am.

428
00:21:58,887 --> 00:21:59,887
Really?

429
00:22:00,145 --> 00:22:01,545
- Here I go.
- Okay.

430
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,988
I'll take one more.

431
00:22:08,130 --> 00:22:10,121
Are you sure you took good ones?
Let me see.

432
00:22:10,161 --> 00:22:13,863
But you can't see your face because the light is behind you.

433
00:22:13,887 --> 00:22:17,246
- They look like a long time couple!
- For real.

434
00:22:17,356 --> 00:22:21,645
You can't see my face at all.
You're really good at taking pictures.

435
00:22:21,670 --> 00:22:23,937
I think they got close right away.

436
00:22:23,973 --> 00:22:27,307
- Is it because they both like each other?
- Yes.

437
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:40,246
Let's write our wishes in first two lines.

438
00:22:40,919 --> 00:22:46,309
And for the other two lines, let's write how we felt after meeting each other.

439
00:22:46,505 --> 00:22:49,305
They're writing it in front of each other.

440
00:22:53,809 --> 00:22:55,285
One, two, three!

441
00:22:58,137 --> 00:23:00,071
I'll read it out loud for you.

442
00:23:00,535 --> 00:23:03,473
Thank you for giving me a fun time.

443
00:23:03,651 --> 00:23:05,731
You put a smiley face. I like it.

444
00:23:06,770 --> 00:23:10,567
I want to see more sides of you.

445
00:23:11,989 --> 00:23:14,389
He's asking her out on another date.

446
00:23:16,067 --> 00:23:18,867
- Should we make it?
- Should we make it?

447
00:23:22,364 --> 00:23:26,949
I thought doing stuff like this was cheesy.

448
00:23:28,216 --> 00:23:30,723
But it's actually fun.

449
00:23:30,809 --> 00:23:31,801
Yeah.

450
00:23:33,926 --> 00:23:35,965
They're making the lanterns.

451
00:23:35,989 --> 00:23:37,523
That looks really cool.

452
00:23:37,548 --> 00:23:38,801
They're making wish lanterns.

453
00:23:38,833 --> 00:23:40,966
Do they float it on water later?

454
00:23:41,012 --> 00:23:42,324
I'm done.

455
00:23:43,536 --> 00:23:44,869
I finished mine too.

456
00:23:45,309 --> 00:23:47,754
- I think we did a good job.
- Yeah we did.

457
00:23:50,044 --> 00:23:52,168
We have to pray. Hurry up and pray.

458
00:23:52,387 --> 00:23:54,654
I wonder what they're praying for.

459
00:23:55,473 --> 00:23:56,473
Hold on!

460
00:23:56,489 --> 00:23:57,889
Let's do it together.

461
00:23:58,442 --> 00:24:00,909
Wow, they're putting it in the water.

462
00:24:05,926 --> 00:24:07,403
Bye!

463
00:24:13,231 --> 00:24:17,457
I hope everything we wrote comes true.

464
00:24:20,387 --> 00:24:21,854
It's already far away.

465
00:24:23,605 --> 00:24:25,213
Should we get going now?

466
00:24:29,684 --> 00:24:32,129
I'm sad too. How does one year go by so fast?

467
00:24:32,216 --> 00:24:33,216
Seriously.

468
00:24:33,395 --> 00:24:36,457
2018 is over now.

469
00:24:36,583 --> 00:24:40,551
They spent time together in 2018 and are entering the new year together.

470
00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:43,220
So I bet it's even more exciting.

471
00:24:45,833 --> 00:24:47,899
What did you think about today?

472
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:50,254
I had a lot of fun today.

473
00:24:50,692 --> 00:24:55,715
This is my first time seeing this in real life.

474
00:24:56,466 --> 00:24:57,801
Thank you.

475
00:24:59,661 --> 00:25:03,778
I thought a lot about where I should take you.

476
00:25:03,942 --> 00:25:08,371
I'm so thankful that you're happy with the things I prepared.

477
00:25:08,473 --> 00:25:10,942
No, I'm the one who's thankful.

478
00:25:12,208 --> 00:25:17,020
If you had fun today,

479
00:25:17,309 --> 00:25:20,535
why don't we meet each other again?

480
00:25:21,433 --> 00:25:22,433
There it is.

481
00:25:22,473 --> 00:25:24,403
He says things very nicely.

482
00:25:31,551 --> 00:25:32,965
What will she say?

483
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:41,356
She didn't answer?

484
00:25:41,505 --> 00:25:43,121
I think it's going to go well.

485
00:25:43,192 --> 00:25:48,371
Do you think Woo-ju just sees him as a friend or...

486
00:25:48,481 --> 00:25:52,574
I think Woo-ju is interested in him too.

487
00:25:57,175 --> 00:26:00,621
- We got a text from daughter this time.
- Once again.

488
00:26:01,495 --> 00:26:02,495
What's this?

489
00:26:02,801 --> 00:26:04,629
My dad would really like it.

490
00:26:04,661 --> 00:26:07,504
This sounds like Seok-hee.
She talks about me a lot.

491
00:26:07,559 --> 00:26:09,942
Yeah, she showed you off last time.

492
00:26:09,997 --> 00:26:11,488
I think she's talking about me.

493
00:26:11,513 --> 00:26:13,934
Soo-bin also talks about her dad a lot too.

494
00:26:14,019 --> 00:26:15,934
She does. Is it Soo-bin?

495
00:26:16,192 --> 00:26:19,559
I think it sounds more like Soo-bin than Seok-hee.

496
00:26:19,981 --> 00:26:22,285
Seok-hee wouldn't phrase it like that.

497
00:26:22,379 --> 00:26:25,168
Joo-yeon's blind date is a chef.

498
00:26:25,364 --> 00:26:26,426
You're right!

499
00:26:26,504 --> 00:26:27,723
She said it after seeing a dish!

500
00:26:27,748 --> 00:26:30,324
Oh, because he's a chef!

501
00:26:30,449 --> 00:26:32,746
Joo-yeon thinks about her dad a lot.

502
00:26:32,825 --> 00:26:34,801
That's right she does.

503
00:26:36,872 --> 00:26:38,035
Where is that?

504
00:26:38,770 --> 00:26:40,370
They're going on a trip.

505
00:26:41,114 --> 00:26:43,047
- Seok-hee?
- It's Seok-hee.

506
00:26:44,098 --> 00:26:45,098
It's Seok-hee!

507
00:26:45,473 --> 00:26:46,863
Where is she going?

508
00:26:46,926 --> 00:26:49,193
It looks like she's at an airport.

509
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:59,146
It's Kimpo airport.

510
00:26:59,171 --> 00:27:01,184
Doesn't that mean she's going abroad?

511
00:27:01,223 --> 00:27:02,357
I bet it's Japan.

512
00:27:06,770 --> 00:27:09,104
You're going to break the suitcase!

513
00:27:09,122 --> 00:27:11,255
He's worried about the suitcase.

514
00:27:14,942 --> 00:27:17,009
Are they going to Japan?
Wow.

515
00:27:18,473 --> 00:27:21,740
Seok-hee is always with that jacket and suitcase.

516
00:27:22,567 --> 00:27:26,500
- She's going somewhere with Yo-Han.
- Where is she going?

517
00:27:29,989 --> 00:27:31,504
Airport fashion!

518
00:27:32,121 --> 00:27:34,332
His walk got better.

519
00:27:34,535 --> 00:27:35,535
Seok-hee.

520
00:27:40,348 --> 00:27:42,015
He does look good though.

521
00:27:42,058 --> 00:27:45,113
- He's gotten more handsome.
- Yo-Han looks good.

522
00:27:45,138 --> 00:27:46,785
It's so cold.

523
00:27:46,895 --> 00:27:49,095
He looks good if he doesn't talk.

524
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:53,895
The first thing he said was "It's cold."

525
00:27:57,043 --> 00:27:59,449
- Did you get a lot of sleep?
- No.

526
00:27:59,496 --> 00:28:02,551
- How much sleep did you get?
- Where are they going anyway?

527
00:28:03,551 --> 00:28:05,751
Are they going to Japan together?

528
00:28:06,966 --> 00:28:09,457
Kimpo airport could mean it's somewhere in the country.

529
00:28:09,473 --> 00:28:13,153
But you can also go to Japan, Taiwan, China...

530
00:28:21,208 --> 00:28:24,145
- Oh, they're going to Jejudo.
- Alone? To Jejudo?

531
00:28:29,341 --> 00:28:30,504
It's so pretty!

532
00:28:31,895 --> 00:28:35,106
Jejudo is prettier in winter than in summer.

533
00:28:43,684 --> 00:28:45,379
Seo-beom has changed a lot too.

534
00:28:45,450 --> 00:28:50,965
Before, he used to get upset when he thought they were going on a trip together.

535
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:52,582
- But now...
- He's fine.

536
00:28:52,607 --> 00:28:53,841
He's understanding.

537
00:28:53,911 --> 00:28:54,978
We're in Jejudo.

538
00:28:57,505 --> 00:29:00,246
The two look like they're on their honeymoon.

539
00:29:00,271 --> 00:29:02,301
Just being there makes you excited.

540
00:29:02,326 --> 00:29:05,309
You've gotten very used to riding in the passenger seat.

541
00:29:05,334 --> 00:29:06,801
I'll get my license next year.

542
00:29:06,826 --> 00:29:08,559
It's okay. I like driving.

543
00:29:08,872 --> 00:29:10,272
I want to try it too.

544
00:29:11,661 --> 00:29:13,128
They're renting a car.

545
00:29:13,153 --> 00:29:15,567
- You have to rent one there.
- Is it this one?

546
00:29:15,606 --> 00:29:16,806
It's not this one.

547
00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:19,559
Is it this one?

548
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:21,004
- Yeah.
- It's nice.

549
00:29:21,036 --> 00:29:22,395
- It's cute, right?
- Yeah.

550
00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:23,449
Isn't this expensive?

551
00:29:23,474 --> 00:29:25,215
But you might have to fold yourself.

552
00:29:25,270 --> 00:29:26,238
Why?

553
00:29:26,255 --> 00:29:27,465
Oh, it's low.

554
00:29:29,613 --> 00:29:31,347
This must be a two seater.

555
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:36,426
- The color is pretty.
- I like the smell.

556
00:29:36,466 --> 00:29:38,466
Did you see how she said that?

557
00:29:40,286 --> 00:29:41,684
Dang, it's pretty.

558
00:29:42,239 --> 00:29:44,824
Want to see something cool?

559
00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:46,154
Yeah, what is it?

560
00:29:47,020 --> 00:29:48,160
What is it?

561
00:29:48,348 --> 00:29:50,615
You prepared something weird, huh?

562
00:29:54,661 --> 00:29:55,928
It's a convertible.

563
00:29:56,083 --> 00:29:57,426
What a girl crush.

564
00:29:57,684 --> 00:29:58,848
It's opening!

565
00:30:00,489 --> 00:30:02,422
I wish it'd open all the way.

566
00:30:02,504 --> 00:30:03,504
What?

567
00:30:03,918 --> 00:30:05,285
What's going on?

568
00:30:09,005 --> 00:30:10,938
- How cute.
- She's shocked.

569
00:30:11,167 --> 00:30:13,082
That must be nice.

570
00:30:13,246 --> 00:30:15,395
The air is nice in Jejudo.

571
00:30:17,433 --> 00:30:19,590
I've never been in a convertible before.

572
00:30:19,615 --> 00:30:20,615
Me neither.

573
00:30:22,809 --> 00:30:25,348
I didn't get to do that when I was younger.
I'm jealous.

574
00:30:25,395 --> 00:30:26,395
Yeah.

575
00:30:29,575 --> 00:30:32,098
What if people think we're weird with the top down?

576
00:30:32,153 --> 00:30:33,293
Why would they?

577
00:30:33,809 --> 00:30:34,942
It's refreshing and nice.

578
00:30:35,005 --> 00:30:39,071
It feels refreshing even when it's cold because you're happy.

579
00:30:43,841 --> 00:30:45,645
Seok-hee is super excited.

580
00:30:45,762 --> 00:30:46,762
How cute!

581
00:30:50,653 --> 00:30:52,453
The beach is really pretty!

582
00:30:57,566 --> 00:30:58,918
I wonder where they went.

583
00:30:58,958 --> 00:31:00,926
He looks sad all of a sudden.

584
00:31:00,951 --> 00:31:02,129
Isn't it a day trip?

585
00:31:02,161 --> 00:31:04,879
- You know they don't do that anymore.
- It's an overnight trip.

586
00:31:04,950 --> 00:31:09,238
Seok-hee might kill Yo-Han if he tries to make a move.

587
00:31:09,380 --> 00:31:12,046
I realized that when they did jiu-jitsu.

588
00:31:12,130 --> 00:31:13,707
Yo-han's going to break a bone.

589
00:31:13,770 --> 00:31:17,637
I realized I have nothing to worry about during jiu-jitsu.

590
00:31:23,223 --> 00:31:24,559
Yongduam Rock.

591
00:31:25,598 --> 00:31:26,932
This is really nice.

592
00:31:27,551 --> 00:31:29,488
It must be a photo zone. I'll take one for you.

593
00:31:29,513 --> 00:31:31,692
- The clouds are pretty.
- They're pretty.

594
00:31:31,723 --> 00:31:33,238
Let's take it together.

595
00:31:33,263 --> 00:31:35,879
- I'll take one for you.
- I'll take one for you too.

596
00:31:36,098 --> 00:31:37,770
Let's ask someone to take it for us.

597
00:31:37,795 --> 00:31:40,223
- Just stand there.
- Let's ask someone!

598
00:31:40,248 --> 00:31:41,903
It looks like the roles have reversed.

599
00:31:41,928 --> 00:31:42,928
He's so cute.

600
00:31:42,953 --> 00:31:44,871
Let's take it together.
I don't want to take it alone.

601
00:31:44,896 --> 00:31:46,598
Stand next to that warning sign.

602
00:31:46,623 --> 00:31:49,223
You've got to take a thrilling picture.

603
00:31:49,426 --> 00:31:51,442
- Let's take it together!
- You have to make it thrilling.

604
00:31:51,467 --> 00:31:52,660
Let's take one together.

605
00:31:52,708 --> 00:31:55,973
Yo-Han wants to take the picture together.

606
00:31:56,294 --> 00:31:57,824
He should just stand there first.

607
00:31:57,872 --> 00:32:00,472
- But he does listen.
- Do a good job.

608
00:32:04,653 --> 00:32:06,379
Yo-Han might blow away in the wind.

609
00:32:06,458 --> 00:32:08,746
One, two...

610
00:32:10,770 --> 00:32:13,004
Yo-Han has gotten even more handsome.

611
00:32:13,029 --> 00:32:14,403
I'll take one for you.

612
00:32:14,434 --> 00:32:16,145
Let's ask someone to take one for us!

613
00:32:16,192 --> 00:32:18,525
Why does he have to talk like that?

614
00:32:18,755 --> 00:32:21,821
- Seok-hee hates taking pictures.
- She does.

615
00:32:24,872 --> 00:32:26,672
I can't because I look fat.

616
00:32:26,697 --> 00:32:28,290
No you don't!

617
00:32:28,395 --> 00:32:29,862
You're not fat at all.

618
00:32:31,161 --> 00:32:32,894
The water is really clear.

619
00:32:35,770 --> 00:32:38,403
- Have you seen something like that?
- What is it?

620
00:32:39,887 --> 00:32:41,754
I've never seen that before.

621
00:32:41,856 --> 00:32:42,856
What is that?

622
00:32:43,348 --> 00:32:45,395
- What is it?
- They're female divers.

623
00:32:45,442 --> 00:32:48,410
They sell what they caught.

624
00:32:48,801 --> 00:32:49,884
- Right?
- Yes.

625
00:32:52,613 --> 00:32:54,301
They're super fresh!

626
00:32:54,676 --> 00:32:57,004
- That's amazing!
- They have that in Jejudo?

627
00:32:57,692 --> 00:32:59,192
That looks so good!

628
00:32:59,348 --> 00:33:00,863
Did you catch these?

629
00:33:01,458 --> 00:33:04,512
- Did you just catch them?
- Someone went in just now. Look.

630
00:33:04,598 --> 00:33:06,598
She's catching some right now.

631
00:33:07,716 --> 00:33:09,465
- What's this?
- Abalones.

632
00:33:09,762 --> 00:33:11,229
And these are conches.

633
00:33:11,364 --> 00:33:13,715
- These are horned conches.
- I want these.

634
00:33:13,926 --> 00:33:15,207
They look the most safe, huh?

635
00:33:15,262 --> 00:33:17,512
Want me to mix them up with abalones and this?

636
00:33:17,653 --> 00:33:18,653
Yes.

637
00:33:23,239 --> 00:33:24,706
$10 if you touch them.

638
00:33:24,708 --> 00:33:26,168
$10 for touching!

639
00:33:26,536 --> 00:33:28,121
$10 if you touch them.

640
00:33:28,660 --> 00:33:30,379
Try touching this one.

641
00:33:31,090 --> 00:33:32,090
Like this?

642
00:33:32,106 --> 00:33:34,173
But my hands aren't that clean.

643
00:33:37,489 --> 00:33:40,301
He looks like the perfect target to play jokes on.

644
00:33:40,348 --> 00:33:41,815
He doesn't bite right?

645
00:33:46,536 --> 00:33:49,653
- I think I know who you are
- Who do you think I am?

646
00:33:49,685 --> 00:33:52,488
Who are you?
Want me to guess?

647
00:33:55,692 --> 00:33:57,759
You're Jo Gap-kyung's daughter.

648
00:34:01,887 --> 00:34:03,270
How did she know?

649
00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:05,731
They watch this show.

650
00:34:06,317 --> 00:34:07,981
What's your relationship with each other?

651
00:34:08,028 --> 00:34:09,262
We're dating.

652
00:34:09,450 --> 00:34:10,598
- You're dating?
- Yes.

653
00:34:10,645 --> 00:34:12,845
She can say that comfortably now.

654
00:34:12,870 --> 00:34:15,034
They're dating. He's her husband.

655
00:34:15,059 --> 00:34:16,393
He's not my husband.

656
00:34:16,450 --> 00:34:18,199
But he's going to be your husband.

657
00:34:18,294 --> 00:34:20,227
- I'm not sure...
- Why not?

658
00:34:22,113 --> 00:34:26,785
The old Seok-hee would've been upset,
but now she just smiles.

659
00:34:26,810 --> 00:34:28,410
She doesn't seem to hate the idea.

660
00:34:28,435 --> 00:34:32,145
Seo-beom, how would you feel if they wanted to get married?

661
00:34:32,223 --> 00:34:33,723
Yo-Han as a son-in-law?

662
00:34:33,770 --> 00:34:38,059
I'm okay with whoever Seok-hee wants to marry.

663
00:34:40,341 --> 00:34:42,474
I'm going to try this one first.

664
00:34:42,499 --> 00:34:45,324
- That's what real raw fish is.
- That looks so good.

665
00:34:45,699 --> 00:34:47,965
The view must be great too.

666
00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:49,020
It's good.

667
00:34:52,614 --> 00:34:54,947
I don't think I can eat sea squirt.

668
00:34:56,434 --> 00:34:57,973
Seok-hee knows how to eat.

669
00:34:58,036 --> 00:34:59,036
Is it good?

670
00:35:00,833 --> 00:35:03,871
Sea squirts are the best to get your appetite going.

671
00:35:03,958 --> 00:35:05,291
I should try it too.

672
00:35:05,449 --> 00:35:06,449
It's so good.

673
00:35:07,340 --> 00:35:09,623
Why are you putting so much sauce?

674
00:35:10,341 --> 00:35:12,770
Yo-Han is basically just eating the sauce.

675
00:35:12,926 --> 00:35:16,993
He might as well just dip his finger in the sauce and eat it.

676
00:35:20,168 --> 00:35:21,535
It's not my style.

677
00:35:24,036 --> 00:35:25,369
The ocean is pretty.

678
00:35:27,692 --> 00:35:30,292
That really is an open view restaurant.

679
00:35:30,551 --> 00:35:31,885
This is a hot place.

680
00:35:32,255 --> 00:35:34,324
- My dad would really like it.
- Like what?

681
00:35:34,348 --> 00:35:36,415
This is where the text is from.

682
00:35:37,809 --> 00:35:38,809
He loves them.

683
00:35:44,020 --> 00:35:45,184
It's so good.

684
00:35:45,997 --> 00:35:47,449
This is...

685
00:35:47,474 --> 00:35:48,754
Look. He looks so happy.

686
00:35:48,786 --> 00:35:51,199
Saying that her dad would like it...

687
00:35:51,294 --> 00:35:53,551
She thought of you when eating something good.

688
00:35:53,598 --> 00:35:57,653
Parents are supposed to think of their kids when they eat something good.

689
00:35:57,708 --> 00:35:59,942
But she's thinking of her dad.

690
00:36:00,020 --> 00:36:02,223
And I really love seafood.

691
00:36:02,278 --> 00:36:04,676
Yeah, that's why Seok-hee...

692
00:36:04,739 --> 00:36:08,395
It's not common to think about your dad at a time like that.

693
00:36:08,528 --> 00:36:11,113
- Buddy, you finished everything?
- Yes.

694
00:36:11,223 --> 00:36:12,801
- Did you enjoy it?
- Yes.

695
00:36:12,864 --> 00:36:14,397
Which one was the best?

696
00:36:14,442 --> 00:36:16,348
- The sea squirt.
- The sea squirts?

697
00:36:16,387 --> 00:36:18,521
I'm happy you finished them all.

698
00:36:19,887 --> 00:36:21,676
- It was good.
- Thank you.

699
00:36:21,701 --> 00:36:23,215
- You guys should come back.
- Okay!

700
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:26,410
Come here on your honeymoon instead of going abroad.

701
00:36:26,739 --> 00:36:30,551
That must be memorable for them.

702
00:36:30,942 --> 00:36:32,192
Take care!

703
00:36:32,278 --> 00:36:33,278
Take care!

704
00:36:34,286 --> 00:36:36,947
If I go to Jejudo with
my girlfriend, I just

705
00:36:36,972 --> 00:36:39,809
want to hold her hands
and walk around freely.

706
00:36:40,582 --> 00:36:42,129
At the hotel lobby?

707
00:36:44,465 --> 00:36:47,465
I don't know why my head hurts so much today.

708
00:36:53,645 --> 00:36:56,660
Wow, look how clear the water is.

709
00:36:57,066 --> 00:36:59,482
- That's so cool!
- This looks fun.

710
00:37:01,410 --> 00:37:02,863
What if he falls in?

711
00:37:02,957 --> 00:37:06,418
It must be really hard to get his balance because he's tall.

712
00:37:06,496 --> 00:37:07,840
And he's a klutz.

713
00:37:07,865 --> 00:37:08,865
We're going.

714
00:37:12,504 --> 00:37:13,613
Do I hold it like this?

715
00:37:13,629 --> 00:37:17,386
Yo-Han does everything to try to be the man.

716
00:37:18,246 --> 00:37:21,222
He said, "Why isn't this moving?"

717
00:37:21,442 --> 00:37:25,442
We don't see sitcoms these days,
but this is a true sitcom.

718
00:37:25,770 --> 00:37:26,777
Yo-Han is...

719
00:37:29,098 --> 00:37:31,098
I guess I'm supposed to do it like this.

720
00:37:32,176 --> 00:37:33,643
I'm driving right now.

721
00:37:37,472 --> 00:37:40,042
- Is he driving it?
- He finds it really cool.

722
00:37:42,206 --> 00:37:44,606
I can't help it. It's my first time.

723
00:37:44,699 --> 00:37:46,766
Grab it shoulder width apart...

724
00:37:47,910 --> 00:37:51,377
Then you should put your hands closer to each other.

725
00:37:52,715 --> 00:37:54,315
I don't want to do this.

726
00:37:54,645 --> 00:37:58,050
Seok-hee made fun of his narrow shoulders.
How hurtful.

727
00:37:58,176 --> 00:37:59,176
Here we go.

728
00:38:03,121 --> 00:38:04,121
This is fun.

729
00:38:08,324 --> 00:38:10,269
It's a lot more boring than you expected, huh?

730
00:38:10,294 --> 00:38:11,910
No, I really like it.

731
00:38:12,293 --> 00:38:14,066
Yo-Han is awesome.

732
00:38:14,091 --> 00:38:17,691
I've wanted to try something like this.

733
00:38:21,254 --> 00:38:22,808
Isn't the ocean nice?

734
00:38:24,692 --> 00:38:25,855
Isn't it pretty?

735
00:38:26,269 --> 00:38:28,035
Let's go to that island.

736
00:38:28,473 --> 00:38:29,473
You want to?

737
00:38:39,582 --> 00:38:40,754
Don't laugh.

738
00:38:41,371 --> 00:38:43,305
I'm trying my best right now.

739
00:38:43,348 --> 00:38:44,668
The two are cute.

740
00:38:47,863 --> 00:38:48,988
I got a cramp.

741
00:38:49,145 --> 00:38:50,254
He got a cramp.

742
00:38:50,488 --> 00:38:51,847
You didn't even row that much!

743
00:38:51,872 --> 00:38:53,332
It's very tiring.

744
00:38:53,988 --> 00:38:55,394
I want to try it.

745
00:38:56,504 --> 00:38:57,644
How do I do it?

746
00:38:57,723 --> 00:38:59,675
Hold it like this.

747
00:39:00,973 --> 00:39:02,106
It's hard, right?

748
00:39:03,028 --> 00:39:05,494
You see how I tired I must be, right?

749
00:39:07,567 --> 00:39:09,367
What's with all the noises?

750
00:39:10,442 --> 00:39:11,684
I'll do it. It's hard, right?

751
00:39:11,684 --> 00:39:13,004
No, this is fun.

752
00:39:13,926 --> 00:39:15,504
She's good.

753
00:39:16,293 --> 00:39:17,293
Let's go.

754
00:39:17,691 --> 00:39:18,832
Go where?

755
00:39:19,348 --> 00:39:20,348
Somewhere.

756
00:39:20,535 --> 00:39:22,113
She looks like Guan Yu.

757
00:39:23,067 --> 00:39:25,933
It looked like the Green Dragon Crescent Blade.

758
00:39:25,988 --> 00:39:28,207
With her hair flying too.

759
00:39:28,879 --> 00:39:30,816
Just row in the direction you want to go.

760
00:39:30,863 --> 00:39:33,663
I'm going to go where there aren't anyone.

761
00:39:35,332 --> 00:39:36,332
There you go.

762
00:39:36,598 --> 00:39:37,840
With the same strength.

763
00:39:37,973 --> 00:39:38,973
You're good.

764
00:39:39,769 --> 00:39:41,371
Seok-hee, you're really good.

765
00:39:41,396 --> 00:39:42,929
I'm good at everything.

766
00:39:43,535 --> 00:39:47,785
I've realized that you're not stronger, but as strong as me.

767
00:39:48,051 --> 00:39:50,410
That was his last pride.

768
00:39:50,653 --> 00:39:52,386
We're the same or similar.

769
00:39:53,692 --> 00:39:55,363
I think I'm doing a good job right now.

770
00:39:55,395 --> 00:39:56,590
We're going fast.

771
00:39:56,996 --> 00:39:58,754
I'm going really fast right now.

772
00:39:59,222 --> 00:40:00,675
They're moving fast.

773
00:40:01,746 --> 00:40:04,379
That's like a boat.

774
00:40:04,512 --> 00:40:06,769
For real, that's the only one moving.

775
00:40:06,801 --> 00:40:08,488
One, two!

776
00:40:09,003 --> 00:40:10,003
One...

777
00:40:10,020 --> 00:40:11,394
Are you embarrassed of me?

778
00:40:11,403 --> 00:40:13,004
One, two!

779
00:40:13,410 --> 00:40:14,941
One, two!

780
00:40:17,081 --> 00:40:19,748
You can put the paddle down and get off.

781
00:40:20,551 --> 00:40:21,551
Just get off.

782
00:40:22,942 --> 00:40:26,008
Why are you grabbing the paddle instead of me?

783
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:30,457
This place is the most fun.

784
00:40:30,482 --> 00:40:32,749
No rowing was the most fun for me.

785
00:40:37,051 --> 00:40:38,051
Stop it!

786
00:40:41,863 --> 00:40:46,330
Have you guys gone to Jejudo to go on a date when you were younger?

787
00:40:46,551 --> 00:40:48,879
- I went for my honeymoon.
- Honeymoon?

788
00:40:48,918 --> 00:40:51,043
A lot of people went to Jejudo for their honeymoon.

789
00:40:51,067 --> 00:40:52,347
What did you do there?

790
00:40:52,372 --> 00:40:58,097
A driver would come, and we have to do whatever he says the whole day.

791
00:40:58,270 --> 00:41:01,215
You wished the night came faster, huh?

792
00:41:01,301 --> 00:41:04,847
Yeah, I wished that we could just go to our room.

793
00:41:07,590 --> 00:41:11,019
We don't want to ride horses and take pictures, right?

794
00:41:11,067 --> 00:41:13,738
It's so funny hearing him say that.

795
00:41:14,488 --> 00:41:16,527
Joo-yeon is adorable.

796
00:41:16,606 --> 00:41:18,539
Is she that cute at home too?

797
00:41:20,386 --> 00:41:21,574
Hold it.

798
00:41:24,340 --> 00:41:26,673
She's like Demi Moore from "Ghost."

799
00:41:26,746 --> 00:41:29,222
I bet she got a lot of butterflies.

800
00:41:40,847 --> 00:41:42,582
That's nice. Where is that?

801
00:41:43,020 --> 00:41:44,402
Oh, a guest house?

802
00:41:44,496 --> 00:41:48,707
Bunch of people get together.
You save money and eat together.

803
00:41:48,973 --> 00:41:51,573
And you share about the vacation spots.

804
00:41:51,637 --> 00:41:54,144
Are we supposed to eat together?

805
00:41:54,285 --> 00:41:56,566
- Yes.
- It's our first time at a guest house.

806
00:41:56,591 --> 00:41:58,785
- It's our first time too.
- Really?

807
00:42:04,051 --> 00:42:05,051
Thank you.

808
00:42:05,762 --> 00:42:07,652
Is this how the culture is?

809
00:42:07,785 --> 00:42:10,691
Yes, it's a party guest house.

810
00:42:10,824 --> 00:42:13,597
We share information together too.

811
00:42:14,145 --> 00:42:15,945
You get to know new people.

812
00:42:16,184 --> 00:42:18,535
Tonight's menu is black pork.

813
00:42:22,238 --> 00:42:24,175
That looks so good!

814
00:42:26,731 --> 00:42:28,863
You guys are a couple, right?

815
00:42:29,003 --> 00:42:31,324
- Yes.
- It looks like it.

816
00:42:31,942 --> 00:42:34,527
How long have you guys been dating for?

817
00:42:34,817 --> 00:42:37,283
We just had our 100 days celebration.

818
00:42:37,871 --> 00:42:39,910
What a fresh new couple!

819
00:42:40,731 --> 00:42:43,816
You have the best reaction.

820
00:42:48,785 --> 00:42:50,488
That looks so good.

821
00:42:55,019 --> 00:42:56,363
Thank you!

822
00:42:59,019 --> 00:43:00,527
Look at his manners.

823
00:43:01,152 --> 00:43:03,752
He always takes care of Seok-hee first.

824
00:43:05,535 --> 00:43:08,972
- Who is she going to give the wrap to?
- Yo-Han of course!

825
00:43:14,659 --> 00:43:20,011
Seok-hee!

826
00:43:20,246 --> 00:43:22,402
If she had given it to Yo-Han,
it means she's changed.

827
00:43:22,427 --> 00:43:23,566
A second wrap!

828
00:43:23,574 --> 00:43:25,660
A person shouldn't change.

829
00:43:25,965 --> 00:43:27,098
It's really good.

830
00:43:29,269 --> 00:43:31,715
Yo-Han, please pick up a spoon.

831
00:43:34,229 --> 00:43:35,433
He doesn't eat!

832
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:39,394
He’s always only using chopsticks even though there's a spoon.

833
00:43:39,504 --> 00:43:41,066
He only eats a little bit.

834
00:43:41,082 --> 00:43:42,675
Look at Seok-hee eat.

835
00:43:48,215 --> 00:43:50,129
Seok-hee, that's enough!

836
00:43:52,317 --> 00:43:54,996
Seok-hee!

837
00:43:55,753 --> 00:43:56,988
It's cute.

838
00:43:59,067 --> 00:44:04,863
Is Ms. Hong usually this quiet or...

839
00:44:05,082 --> 00:44:08,216
No, it's because she's enjoying the food a lot.

840
00:44:08,918 --> 00:44:11,050
You have to let her be so she can eat a lot.

841
00:44:11,098 --> 00:44:12,564
He's her spokesperson.

842
00:44:12,863 --> 00:44:13,863
Her lawyer.

843
00:44:14,253 --> 00:44:16,215
Which place did you like the best from today?

844
00:44:16,310 --> 00:44:19,433
I liked just being in the car the most.

845
00:44:22,980 --> 00:44:24,613
He liked it when they're alone.

846
00:44:24,652 --> 00:44:29,558
I wasn't into going on trips before,
but I've been on many since dating her.

847
00:44:29,590 --> 00:44:31,257
I think it's really good.

848
00:44:31,645 --> 00:44:33,911
You guys haven't been to Udo, huh?

849
00:44:34,136 --> 00:44:35,136
Udo?

850
00:44:35,161 --> 00:44:37,308
- Udo is really nice.
- Have you guys been?

851
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:38,520
Seok-hee...

852
00:44:38,559 --> 00:44:43,292
It's different. You have to spend the night in Udo if you’re in Jejudo.

853
00:44:43,660 --> 00:44:45,316
The boat times are...

854
00:44:45,731 --> 00:44:48,636
I'll tell you later when the last boat time is.

855
00:44:48,661 --> 00:44:50,324
When the boat stops running.

856
00:44:50,348 --> 00:44:52,410
We should exchange numbers.

857
00:44:52,933 --> 00:44:54,535
He was going for it.

858
00:44:54,567 --> 00:44:56,129
Let's do a toast.

859
00:44:56,207 --> 00:44:58,472
Shall we do a last toast?

860
00:44:59,098 --> 00:45:00,582
Thank you!

861
00:45:16,785 --> 00:45:20,480
I'll take you to your rooms. It's this way.
Follow me.

862
00:45:21,144 --> 00:45:22,944
I'll tell you the password.

863
00:45:23,653 --> 00:45:24,653
One room?

864
00:45:24,692 --> 00:45:26,183
It's fine now.

865
00:45:26,246 --> 00:45:27,246
What?

866
00:45:27,449 --> 00:45:28,583
That's not right.

867
00:45:35,574 --> 00:45:37,241
They have separate rooms.

868
00:45:42,535 --> 00:45:43,535
This is nice.

869
00:45:44,840 --> 00:45:46,504
Their rooms should be farther apart.

870
00:45:46,529 --> 00:45:48,729
There's a connecting room inside.

871
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:53,300
It'd be funny if they went through the wall.

872
00:45:53,543 --> 00:45:55,129
But I trust Yo-Han.

873
00:45:57,682 --> 00:45:59,457
Please don't lay down.

874
00:46:00,293 --> 00:46:02,826
Why do you look like you've collapsed?

875
00:46:03,192 --> 00:46:07,574
It's too big for one person.

876
00:46:08,706 --> 00:46:09,840
It is really big.

877
00:46:09,865 --> 00:46:11,398
You can cook there too.

878
00:46:12,254 --> 00:46:13,254
Hong Seok-hee!

879
00:46:13,332 --> 00:46:15,269
You can hear him.

880
00:46:16,871 --> 00:46:18,894
- Who is it?
- Are you going to sleep?

881
00:46:19,473 --> 00:46:21,238
- What?
- They should grab a beer.

882
00:46:21,263 --> 00:46:24,796
- Yeah, they went all the way over there.
- No, why?

883
00:46:30,387 --> 00:46:31,720
I know the password.

884
00:46:32,676 --> 00:46:34,308
- What?
- He knows the password?

885
00:46:34,333 --> 00:46:36,133
He saw the owner put it in.

886
00:46:39,363 --> 00:46:40,363
Oh, I'm wrong.

887
00:46:41,973 --> 00:46:45,410
That was dangerous. I'm going to report you.

888
00:46:46,542 --> 00:46:48,035
It'd be funny if
she really did.

889
00:46:48,069 --> 00:46:50,965
What if she takes him to
get a marriage license?

890
00:46:53,628 --> 00:46:55,207
I'm an old man.

891
00:47:16,910 --> 00:47:17,910
Where's that?

892
00:47:19,379 --> 00:47:20,646
Did you sleep well?

893
00:47:20,676 --> 00:47:21,676
No.

894
00:47:21,715 --> 00:47:24,848
- Why not?
- We were supposed to get up early.

895
00:47:25,168 --> 00:47:28,355
But it rained out of nowhere.
We were supposed to see the sunrise.

896
00:47:28,380 --> 00:47:30,738
Oh, they were going to see the sunrise but it rained.

897
00:47:30,770 --> 00:47:32,238
That always happens.

898
00:47:32,410 --> 00:47:34,877
- What?
- It usually looks like that?

899
00:47:35,543 --> 00:47:37,410
Wow, that's amazing!

900
00:47:45,082 --> 00:47:47,882
You know the song I told you I was writing?

901
00:47:47,942 --> 00:47:49,527
He's writing a song?

902
00:47:49,582 --> 00:47:50,574
I finished it.

903
00:47:50,637 --> 00:47:52,037
There's a piano here.

904
00:47:53,832 --> 00:47:54,832
Finally?

905
00:47:55,176 --> 00:47:56,243
He wrote a song.

906
00:47:56,268 --> 00:47:59,113
Listen to it. You're the first one hearing it.

907
00:47:59,215 --> 00:48:01,882
Listen to it and tell me what you think.

908
00:48:02,660 --> 00:48:05,574
- Play it.
- I think you can listen to it.

909
00:48:05,730 --> 00:48:08,130
But don't be so serious. It's funny.

910
00:48:08,809 --> 00:48:11,277
But this is a serious song.

911
00:48:11,302 --> 00:48:12,835
He plays the piano too?

912
00:48:12,879 --> 00:48:15,412
I'm going to be serious.
Don't laugh.

913
00:48:15,437 --> 00:48:17,715
Yo-Han poured his heart into it.

914
00:48:17,832 --> 00:48:19,410
Let's listen to it.

915
00:48:22,582 --> 00:48:24,597
It's okay...

916
00:48:26,962 --> 00:48:27,970
Come on.

917
00:48:33,470 --> 00:48:35,782
- I told you not to laugh.
- I wasn't!

918
00:48:35,814 --> 00:48:38,281
- Don't laugh.
- I'm always smiling.

919
00:48:43,321 --> 00:48:45,423
I want you to listen to it carefully, okay?

920
00:48:45,448 --> 00:48:46,448
Play it.

921
00:48:47,454 --> 00:48:49,556
It's okay...

922
00:48:55,298 --> 00:48:57,775
This is just messed up!

923
00:48:58,041 --> 00:49:00,345
This is messed up editing!

924
00:49:00,735 --> 00:49:02,203
We're not okay!

925
00:49:02,322 --> 00:49:04,446
This isn't okay!

926
00:49:06,142 --> 00:49:07,276
This is really...

927
00:49:07,345 --> 00:49:08,610
This is really wrong.

928
00:49:08,642 --> 00:49:10,345
We really wanted to hear it, right?

929
00:49:10,370 --> 00:49:11,437
This isn't okay.

930
00:49:11,478 --> 00:49:13,860
Seo-beom, you're an artist too.

931
00:49:13,939 --> 00:49:16,642
Can't you tell from the first line?

932
00:49:16,869 --> 00:49:19,314
They lyrics are what's important.

933
00:49:19,829 --> 00:49:23,439
He sat Seok-hee down and told her it's the first song he's written.

934
00:49:23,471 --> 00:49:24,837
I wonder what the lyrics are.

935
00:49:24,868 --> 00:49:27,853
"Is it okay to have that big of an appetite?"

936
00:49:27,878 --> 00:49:29,204
What if it's something like that?

937
00:49:29,229 --> 00:49:30,629
"Don't you get sick?"

938
00:49:30,654 --> 00:49:33,470
"Is your stomach okay?"

939
00:49:34,033 --> 00:49:36,868
"Your digestion ability is amazing."

940
00:49:41,408 --> 00:49:43,874
We got a text from the guy this time.

941
00:49:44,267 --> 00:49:45,267
Yes...

942
00:49:45,767 --> 00:49:48,298
- "What's wrong?"
- "I can't stop!"

943
00:49:48,626 --> 00:49:50,064
"That scared me."

944
00:49:52,228 --> 00:49:54,048
I can't stop my love for you!

945
00:49:54,127 --> 00:49:55,735
We ruined it.

946
00:49:55,970 --> 00:49:58,681
I think they're talking about driving a car.

947
00:49:59,072 --> 00:50:00,735
"I can't stop the car!"

948
00:50:02,595 --> 00:50:04,064
The brakes are broken!

949
00:50:04,142 --> 00:50:07,689
And then he stops the car, and she goes, "You scared me."

950
00:50:07,705 --> 00:50:09,939
I think there's going to be a kiss.

951
00:50:10,072 --> 00:50:12,134
"I can't stop my feelings."

952
00:50:12,159 --> 00:50:14,439
Something like this. "I'm sorry I can't stop."

953
00:50:14,548 --> 00:50:15,615
And then a kiss.

954
00:50:15,892 --> 00:50:18,478
- "You scared me!"
- That's it.

955
00:50:18,548 --> 00:50:23,110
Let's see how we were baited this time.

956
00:50:24,080 --> 00:50:26,931
- What's your relationship status?
- Oh, it's Joo-yeon.

957
00:50:26,986 --> 00:50:27,986
We're...

958
00:50:30,955 --> 00:50:31,955
We're...

959
00:50:34,149 --> 00:50:38,025
dating but we're not official yet.

960
00:50:40,689 --> 00:50:42,384
- We're not dating yet.
- He's honest.

961
00:50:42,408 --> 00:50:43,579
I see.

962
00:50:44,002 --> 00:50:47,548
I hope your feelings grow through this experience.

963
00:50:48,173 --> 00:50:49,640
- Enjoy.
- Thank you.

964
00:50:49,891 --> 00:50:52,032
We need to get the water.

965
00:50:52,329 --> 00:50:55,564
- It's already getting on my hand.
- We'll water it little by little.

966
00:50:55,861 --> 00:50:57,661
- Little by little?
- Yes.

967
00:50:57,686 --> 00:51:00,845
- I'm going to do it like I'm making bread.
- Like he's making bread.

968
00:51:00,870 --> 00:51:02,704
This is what you do when you make bread.

969
00:51:02,735 --> 00:51:04,025
Try doing it like me.

970
00:51:04,050 --> 00:51:05,782
It really does look like I'm making bread.

971
00:51:05,798 --> 00:51:08,065
This is what you do when you bake.

972
00:51:09,525 --> 00:51:10,658
You're very fast.

973
00:51:12,213 --> 00:51:13,946
Mine won't clump together.

974
00:51:13,986 --> 00:51:15,782
He's doing it like he's making food.

975
00:51:15,807 --> 00:51:17,595
He might taste it too.

976
00:51:18,017 --> 00:51:19,335
This is pretty hard.

977
00:51:22,134 --> 00:51:23,290
Use this one.

978
00:51:27,219 --> 00:51:30,196
- It's going to be easy to work with.
- Why is it hot?

979
00:51:31,384 --> 00:51:34,556
Did my affection get in there?

980
00:51:35,338 --> 00:51:37,165
He said that directly?

981
00:51:37,478 --> 00:51:39,462
He has such a nice smile.

982
00:51:41,134 --> 00:51:43,079
Wow, this is so cool.

983
00:51:45,446 --> 00:51:46,571
Are you done?

984
00:51:46,728 --> 00:51:47,728
- Yes.
- Is it working?

985
00:51:47,753 --> 00:51:50,594
- Are you bringing it back to life?
- It's alive again.

986
00:51:50,689 --> 00:51:53,422
He's good because it's like making dough.

987
00:51:58,329 --> 00:52:00,766
I'll put it in for you.

988
00:52:01,649 --> 00:52:03,055
What a gentleman.

989
00:52:04,517 --> 00:52:05,517
Let's see.

990
00:52:07,454 --> 00:52:09,946
He's craft with his hands like a true chef.

991
00:52:10,017 --> 00:52:11,017
Let's see.

992
00:52:11,939 --> 00:52:13,805
Where should I put it? Here?

993
00:52:13,892 --> 00:52:15,727
- Yeah.
- But it kept coming off.

994
00:52:15,805 --> 00:52:17,329
It sticks. Try it.

995
00:52:17,743 --> 00:52:19,677
It won't? I'll do it for you.

996
00:52:20,517 --> 00:52:22,524
Wasn't he using a formal tone before?

997
00:52:22,549 --> 00:52:25,251
Does your heart flutter if a guy uses a casual tone little by little?

998
00:52:25,282 --> 00:52:28,204
Yes, it becomes comfortable naturally...

999
00:52:28,328 --> 00:52:30,337
- Using a casual tone here and there?
- Yes.

1000
00:52:30,423 --> 00:52:31,423
Got it, kiddo.

1001
00:52:33,650 --> 00:52:36,016
- Did you guys have a good time?
- Yes.

1002
00:52:36,134 --> 00:52:38,837
- Shall we take a look?
- Sure.

1003
00:52:39,172 --> 00:52:40,899
But he keeps laughing.

1004
00:52:41,454 --> 00:52:43,988
It looked like things were going well.

1005
00:52:44,861 --> 00:52:48,462
You put bangs on him?

1006
00:52:48,571 --> 00:52:50,705
Do you know Ahn Jae-wook's hair?

1007
00:52:52,032 --> 00:52:55,579
Oh, I see. It's Ahn Jae-wook...

1008
00:52:56,954 --> 00:52:59,021
You can tell his age from that.

1009
00:53:01,321 --> 00:53:03,977
- You sound like him!
- You're good!

1010
00:53:04,821 --> 00:53:06,430
You could be a singer.

1011
00:53:06,455 --> 00:53:08,157
Please help me out.

1012
00:53:09,571 --> 00:53:10,971
Shall we take a look?

1013
00:53:11,665 --> 00:53:13,999
- You're not shocked, right?
- No!

1014
00:53:14,328 --> 00:53:15,977
It wasn't supposed to be that shape.

1015
00:53:16,002 --> 00:53:18,501
- But this is still really cute.
- It's cute, right?

1016
00:53:18,526 --> 00:53:21,633
- Good work.
- Thank you.

1017
00:53:21,814 --> 00:53:23,993
They hadn't decided to use the casual tone yet.

1018
00:53:24,040 --> 00:53:25,962
I asked So-Jin earlier.

1019
00:53:26,095 --> 00:53:30,055
I guess it makes your heart flutter when there's a causal tone here and there?

1020
00:53:30,165 --> 00:53:32,923
Yes. It becomes awkward when you say, "Let's use the casual tone."

1021
00:53:32,948 --> 00:53:36,344
So he's just putting it here and there to make her feel comfortable.

1022
00:53:36,407 --> 00:53:39,298
You use formal tones and say, "Did you eat? It's this way."

1023
00:53:39,329 --> 00:53:40,837
And then say, "Hey, be careful."

1024
00:53:40,915 --> 00:53:41,915
Like this?

1025
00:53:42,852 --> 00:53:44,719
You were accurate this time.

1026
00:53:50,516 --> 00:53:52,610
Hee-chul looks cool today.

1027
00:53:52,829 --> 00:53:54,763
You hit the nail on the head.

1028
00:54:04,829 --> 00:54:07,096
They went camping all of a sudden?

1029
00:54:18,212 --> 00:54:19,962
She's tired.

1030
00:54:20,446 --> 00:54:22,312
She must be really sleeping.

1031
00:54:22,587 --> 00:54:23,854
What are you doing?

1032
00:54:25,126 --> 00:54:26,259
Are you sleeping?

1033
00:54:26,657 --> 00:54:28,477
You told me to rest.

1034
00:54:29,196 --> 00:54:30,493
I was just laying here.

1035
00:54:30,518 --> 00:54:31,883
This must be it!

1036
00:54:32,149 --> 00:54:34,501
- He's shaking it.
- Isn't it too low?

1037
00:54:34,766 --> 00:54:36,425
- To the ground?
- Yeah.

1038
00:54:36,634 --> 00:54:39,040
- I wanted to hang it higher, but...
- You can't huh?

1039
00:54:39,056 --> 00:54:41,837
I'm short, so it can't go any higher.

1040
00:54:41,986 --> 00:54:44,915
You get sleepy when someone shakes the hammock for you.

1041
00:54:44,970 --> 00:54:47,133
It's like shaking a cradle.

1042
00:54:47,720 --> 00:54:49,653
- Are you shaking it?
- Yes.

1043
00:54:50,243 --> 00:54:52,476
- This is really fun.
- Is it really fun?

1044
00:54:53,609 --> 00:54:54,938
Isn't it too much?

1045
00:54:55,048 --> 00:54:56,712
He shouldn't shake it that hard.

1046
00:54:56,737 --> 00:54:58,555
That looks scary.

1047
00:54:58,681 --> 00:55:00,883
A hammock can cause a fight.

1048
00:55:04,689 --> 00:55:06,289
This is making me dizzy.

1049
00:55:06,525 --> 00:55:09,196
Let's look inside together.

1050
00:55:10,236 --> 00:55:11,236
Camping!

1051
00:55:12,040 --> 00:55:13,352
- This is...
- Yes?

1052
00:55:13,579 --> 00:55:15,977
I should open up the sleeping bag.

1053
00:55:17,500 --> 00:55:20,100
Oh, you're supposed to do it like this.

1054
00:55:20,275 --> 00:55:22,923
Are you supposed to go in like this?

1055
00:55:24,415 --> 00:55:26,321
Have you slept in a sleeping bag before?

1056
00:55:26,346 --> 00:55:28,079
At home when I was a baby.

1057
00:55:28,103 --> 00:55:29,303
- At home?
- Yes.

1058
00:55:30,157 --> 00:55:34,224
Joo-yeon has become cuter because she's with someone her age.

1059
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:37,852
You're going to lay down right now?

1060
00:55:41,689 --> 00:55:44,079
- I'm not going to lay down!
- Hurry up and come outside.

1061
00:55:44,142 --> 00:55:45,993
We need to eat.

1062
00:55:46,743 --> 00:55:48,821
Why do you keep trying
to cook for me?

1063
00:55:48,846 --> 00:55:50,246
Because we're hungry.

1064
00:55:50,290 --> 00:55:51,524
This is warm.

1065
00:55:51,595 --> 00:55:53,462
I prepared some ingredients.

1066
00:55:53,501 --> 00:55:55,923
- Wow, you're going to cook?
- I bet he's good.

1067
00:55:55,948 --> 00:55:58,482
It's making me have high expectations.

1068
00:55:58,946 --> 00:56:02,063
- Look at the ingredients!
- That's camping food?

1069
00:56:03,095 --> 00:56:04,695
Isn't that a restaurant?

1070
00:56:04,814 --> 00:56:07,196
I'm going to make you two dishes.

1071
00:56:07,650 --> 00:56:10,665
It's Spanish style roasted chicken.

1072
00:56:10,743 --> 00:56:12,743
Spanish style roasted chicken?

1073
00:56:12,821 --> 00:56:15,102
They're eating a Spanish dish at a camping ground.

1074
00:56:15,212 --> 00:56:17,165
And Portugal seafood soup.

1075
00:56:17,196 --> 00:56:18,477
Portugal?

1076
00:56:19,689 --> 00:56:21,876
Let's eat.

1077
00:56:21,901 --> 00:56:23,540
It sounds good even if I don't know what it is.

1078
00:56:23,579 --> 00:56:25,229
- You have to be careful.
- Why?

1079
00:56:25,268 --> 00:56:27,299
Because...
Step aside for a second.

1080
00:56:30,643 --> 00:56:31,643
What is it?

1081
00:56:32,791 --> 00:56:35,250
I got ride of the scent with alcohol.

1082
00:56:45,432 --> 00:56:48,205
They're cooking very well right now.

1083
00:56:51,260 --> 00:56:55,002
If you put onions with chicken,
it tastes good.

1084
00:56:55,049 --> 00:56:56,049
That's right.

1085
00:56:56,892 --> 00:56:58,963
Chefs look the coolest when they're cutting stuff.

1086
00:56:58,995 --> 00:57:00,528
Let's learn the recipe.

1087
00:57:01,331 --> 00:57:05,291
We're going to cook the mushrooms slowly at the same time too.

1088
00:57:05,369 --> 00:57:06,370
Okay.

1089
00:57:09,159 --> 00:57:11,002
There's nothing Joo-yeon can help with.

1090
00:57:11,026 --> 00:57:13,557
Want me to teach you how to stir fry?

1091
00:57:13,620 --> 00:57:14,620
Yeah.

1092
00:57:14,705 --> 00:57:15,713
It's simple.

1093
00:57:15,784 --> 00:57:17,717
Did you hear her say, "Yeah?"

1094
00:57:18,034 --> 00:57:19,697
Joo-yeon is cute.

1095
00:57:19,917 --> 00:57:23,250
I think she's definitely seeing him more as a man.

1096
00:57:24,612 --> 00:57:26,945
- You just use your wrist.
- Okay.

1097
00:57:27,729 --> 00:57:30,276
- Only the left hand?
- You can use the right hand too.

1098
00:57:30,424 --> 00:57:33,091
- Can I use both hands?
- Yes. Grab it.

1099
00:57:43,581 --> 00:57:45,914
I bet she got a lot of butterflies.

1100
00:57:46,448 --> 00:57:48,869
One, two, three.
Do it lightly.

1101
00:57:48,994 --> 00:57:50,705
One, two, three! Lightly.

1102
00:57:50,932 --> 00:57:52,369
One, two, three! Lightly.

1103
00:57:52,564 --> 00:57:54,408
- One, two, three! Lightly.
- He's a man.

1104
00:57:54,464 --> 00:57:55,510
Yes, like that.

1105
00:57:55,580 --> 00:57:58,408
- One more time.
- One, two, three! Lightly.

1106
00:57:58,714 --> 00:58:02,057
Touching is natural whenever you teach someone something like golf.

1107
00:58:02,089 --> 00:58:05,057
That's why you're continuing with billiards lessons.

1108
00:58:05,104 --> 00:58:11,135
How do girls feel when a guy holds them from behind for the first time?

1109
00:58:11,160 --> 00:58:13,674
I think her heart is fluttering a lot right now.

1110
00:58:13,729 --> 00:58:17,088
He's teaching her and he looks very dependable all of a sudden.

1111
00:58:17,143 --> 00:58:20,210
I bet she felt like a baby learning something.

1112
00:58:21,268 --> 00:58:23,572
I think the two look really good together.

1113
00:58:23,635 --> 00:58:27,035
I think you'll be eating Spanish chicken dish soon.

1114
00:58:28,588 --> 00:58:31,055
Their honeymoon will be in Barcelona.

1115
00:58:32,604 --> 00:58:36,651
- Now, we'll cook the chicken...
- It's like they brought the restaurant.

1116
00:58:36,676 --> 00:58:38,447
It looks good already.

1117
00:58:38,472 --> 00:58:40,205
I marinated it beforehand.

1118
00:58:44,917 --> 00:58:47,252
Didn't you say your mom makes Spanish dishes?

1119
00:58:47,315 --> 00:58:49,982
She learned a few of the Spanish dishes.

1120
00:58:50,010 --> 00:58:52,861
Is there a Spanish dish you learned from your mom?

1121
00:58:52,955 --> 00:58:54,729
There's something I'd like to make for you.

1122
00:58:54,760 --> 00:58:56,182
- You just thought of one?
- Yes.

1123
00:58:56,207 --> 00:58:57,660
What is it? Is it a secret?

1124
00:58:57,715 --> 00:58:59,519
- Gambas.
- Gambas?

1125
00:58:59,544 --> 00:59:01,477
She knows how to make gambas.

1126
00:59:01,496 --> 00:59:02,777
Shrimp dishes are good.

1127
00:59:02,802 --> 00:59:04,972
Are you going to make it with your own recipe?

1128
00:59:05,005 --> 00:59:07,449
- Like how my mom taught me.
- Your mom's recipe?

1129
00:59:07,519 --> 00:59:09,425
- I want to try it.
- Really?

1130
00:59:09,465 --> 00:59:10,230
Yes.

1131
00:59:10,309 --> 00:59:12,214
Now, Joo-yeon is...

1132
00:59:12,409 --> 00:59:13,886
Her mom's recipe.

1133
00:59:13,941 --> 00:59:15,339
She must've learned from her mom.

1134
00:59:15,364 --> 00:59:20,246
My wife never lets me or my daughter into the kitchen when she cooks.

1135
00:59:21,769 --> 00:59:24,769
Because she's unwrapping the food she bought?

1136
00:59:24,824 --> 00:59:26,699
She's opening the microwavable foods.

1137
00:59:26,724 --> 00:59:28,160
"Oh, honey!"

1138
00:59:29,214 --> 00:59:30,269
That's not it.

1139
00:59:30,465 --> 00:59:35,964
She doesn't like it when we try to help her with her work.

1140
00:59:36,215 --> 00:59:37,605
Oh, she doesn't like it.

1141
00:59:37,630 --> 00:59:39,292
She thinks of it as her work.

1142
00:59:39,379 --> 00:59:41,933
Moms usually call their daughters so they can teach them.

1143
00:59:42,027 --> 00:59:45,863
No. She learned everything after she got married too.

1144
00:59:45,965 --> 00:59:49,152
- So she says they'll learn.
- Oh, since they'll learn eventually.

1145
00:59:49,309 --> 00:59:51,714
- She never lets us in.
- Not even for washing dishes?

1146
00:59:51,739 --> 00:59:52,558
No.

1147
00:59:52,590 --> 00:59:55,402
Then the first person she's cooking for is Kyung-hoon.

1148
00:59:55,418 --> 00:59:57,151
I bet it's her first time.

1149
01:00:00,699 --> 01:00:02,511
It looks like a cooking competition.

1150
01:00:02,574 --> 01:00:04,641
Be careful to not cut yourself.

1151
01:00:07,559 --> 01:00:09,621
Want me to cut some up for you?

1152
01:00:09,646 --> 01:00:11,183
Something like that!

1153
01:00:11,816 --> 01:00:13,246
He's considerate.

1154
01:00:16,191 --> 01:00:18,591
I think you can put them in the pan.

1155
01:00:20,879 --> 01:00:22,612
You can just finish those.

1156
01:00:22,691 --> 01:00:27,050
Good cooks get nervous in front of professionals too.

1157
01:00:27,075 --> 01:00:30,246
Not just for cooking, but when it comes to singing too.

1158
01:00:30,277 --> 01:00:35,902
Even the best singers get nervous in front of pros like Jo Yong-pil and Hong Seo-beom.

1159
01:00:36,027 --> 01:00:43,494
The whole point of gambas is having enough garlic oil.

1160
01:00:44,948 --> 01:00:48,338
Am I putting my arms around you?

1161
01:00:53,103 --> 01:00:56,556
Am I putting my arms around you?

1162
01:01:00,924 --> 01:01:03,058
Am I putting my arms around you?

1163
01:01:03,190 --> 01:01:04,190
What is this?

1164
01:01:05,119 --> 01:01:07,338
- I can't stop.
- You scared me.

1165
01:01:08,486 --> 01:01:10,252
This is where it's from!

1166
01:01:13,791 --> 01:01:15,455
That was very new!

1167
01:01:16,323 --> 01:01:17,916
He went like this.

1168
01:01:17,963 --> 01:01:20,430
It's annoying when it's between guys.

1169
01:01:20,479 --> 01:01:23,080
That's why girls like tall guys.

1170
01:01:24,745 --> 01:01:26,545
That made my heart flutter.

1171
01:01:26,720 --> 01:01:28,728
- Was that intentional?
- That was intentional, right?

1172
01:01:28,753 --> 01:01:30,400
Of course! He could've went around her.

1173
01:01:30,425 --> 01:01:31,931
Right? It was intentional!

1174
01:01:32,041 --> 01:01:35,072
Joo-yeon did get flustered.
She looked more surprised.

1175
01:01:35,104 --> 01:01:37,900
Because he came in out of nowhere.

1176
01:01:38,752 --> 01:01:40,352
That was really special.

1177
01:01:40,377 --> 01:01:42,189
But I think Joo-yeon likes it too.

1178
01:01:42,276 --> 01:01:45,135
She could go like this...

1179
01:01:46,916 --> 01:01:48,861
It's cute. Isn't it beautiful?

1180
01:01:48,901 --> 01:01:50,701
That was a legendary scene.

1181
01:01:50,854 --> 01:01:52,619
Put in the sliced garlic.

1182
01:01:52,745 --> 01:01:56,211
You can put in based on how spicy you want it to be.

1183
01:01:56,307 --> 01:01:57,494
It's going well.

1184
01:02:00,541 --> 01:02:03,955
- You cooked for me last time.
- Right.

1185
01:02:04,846 --> 01:02:09,314
So I wanted to make you this as a way of saying thank you.

1186
01:02:09,791 --> 01:02:13,096
Since you're always cooking for other people.

1187
01:02:13,291 --> 01:02:14,877
- Right.
- You never...

1188
01:02:15,041 --> 01:02:17,994
To be honest, it's been a while since someone else has cooked for me.

1189
01:02:18,019 --> 01:02:20,286
They're not looking at each other.

1190
01:02:20,329 --> 01:02:21,329
For real.

1191
01:02:21,354 --> 01:02:23,774
I think the arm move made things very awkward.

1192
01:02:23,799 --> 01:02:27,430
- Because it was so heart fluttering.
- I'm looking forward to it.

1193
01:02:29,173 --> 01:02:31,344
My dish is almost finished.

1194
01:02:31,415 --> 01:02:32,586
- Kyung-hoon.
- Yes?

1195
01:02:32,617 --> 01:02:34,610
Can you try the shrimp since I made it?

1196
01:02:34,634 --> 01:02:35,767
Yes, I'll try it.

1197
01:02:37,149 --> 01:02:38,555
Do you think it's done?

1198
01:02:39,743 --> 01:02:41,276
Do you think it's done?

1199
01:02:41,852 --> 01:02:43,024
His hand!

1200
01:02:43,180 --> 01:02:45,563
His touches are natural.

1201
01:02:46,266 --> 01:02:48,602
I'm glad it's good.

1202
01:02:52,974 --> 01:02:55,552
- There's a dish like that?
- Seafood soup?

1203
01:02:56,045 --> 01:02:58,489
- Potatoes and sauce...
- That looks good.

1204
01:02:58,514 --> 01:03:01,614
- What's that?
- That's the one Joo-yeon made, right?

1205
01:03:06,412 --> 01:03:08,945
Which one would you like to try first?

1206
01:03:11,935 --> 01:03:13,630
That looks so good.

1207
01:03:17,295 --> 01:03:18,529
Is that rice?

1208
01:03:19,342 --> 01:03:20,475
It's warm inside.

1209
01:03:20,500 --> 01:03:21,767
The gambas is good.

1210
01:03:21,792 --> 01:03:22,925
- Really?
- Yes.

1211
01:03:24,591 --> 01:03:25,591
It's good.

1212
01:03:26,420 --> 01:03:28,820
Don't the potatoes look really soft?

1213
01:03:32,880 --> 01:03:35,080
It's cold even when it's not hot.

1214
01:03:35,873 --> 01:03:38,806
I really like eating it with the vegetables.

1215
01:03:41,334 --> 01:03:42,974
Joo-yeon eats a lot.

1216
01:03:43,513 --> 01:03:44,513
It's good.

1217
01:03:45,842 --> 01:03:47,975
I know I made it, but it's good.

1218
01:03:50,685 --> 01:03:52,138
- This is really good.
- I agree.

1219
01:03:52,170 --> 01:03:53,529
Get a big spoonful.

1220
01:03:53,638 --> 01:03:55,208
- I did.
- It's really good.

1221
01:03:55,388 --> 01:03:56,388
It's good.

1222
01:03:56,753 --> 01:03:59,636
I haven't eaten the one I made.

1223
01:04:00,035 --> 01:04:01,370
Why aren't you eating it?

1224
01:04:01,433 --> 01:04:02,966
Because these are good.

1225
01:04:03,058 --> 01:04:05,089
It's okay. I'm eating it.

1226
01:04:06,746 --> 01:04:09,946
He casually says things that make the other person happy.

1227
01:04:10,042 --> 01:04:13,776
They're eating the food that the other person has made for them.

1228
01:04:13,909 --> 01:04:16,050
They're the only two people in that space.

1229
01:04:16,105 --> 01:04:17,438
I really enjoyed it.

1230
01:04:18,065 --> 01:04:19,739
I enjoyed the gambas too.

1231
01:04:19,824 --> 01:04:24,245
I heard you can see a lot of stars here.

1232
01:04:24,316 --> 01:04:26,116
Do you want to go see them?

1233
01:04:26,141 --> 01:04:27,141
Okay.

1234
01:04:27,166 --> 01:04:31,073
We can blow up the air beds in the tent.

1235
01:04:31,314 --> 01:04:34,089
- Oh, with the wind?
- Yes, you just use the wind.

1236
01:04:37,050 --> 01:04:38,370
How do you do this?

1237
01:04:39,136 --> 01:04:40,995
Did you hear her voice?
"How do you do this?"

1238
01:04:41,020 --> 01:04:42,854
- You have to run.
- Be careful.

1239
01:04:42,879 --> 01:04:45,079
Oh you just put in air like that.

1240
01:04:45,128 --> 01:04:46,928
I think you're supposed to--

1241
01:04:49,042 --> 01:04:52,612
Run...
Be careful!

1242
01:04:52,637 --> 01:04:54,675
You have to keep doing that?

1243
01:04:54,761 --> 01:04:56,628
I've never seen that either.

1244
01:04:57,371 --> 01:04:59,300
- Want to go run a lap?
- A lap?

1245
01:04:59,325 --> 01:05:01,604
Yeah. Let's go this way and around the back.

1246
01:05:01,629 --> 01:05:02,629
Okay.

1247
01:05:04,433 --> 01:05:05,833
You have to run fast.

1248
01:05:08,675 --> 01:05:10,308
Come back from there.

1249
01:05:10,964 --> 01:05:12,229
That's cool.

1250
01:05:12,402 --> 01:05:14,503
That's simple!

1251
01:05:14,972 --> 01:05:15,972
An air bed?

1252
01:05:16,277 --> 01:05:17,277
That's nice.

1253
01:05:19,167 --> 01:05:20,394
Is it hard?

1254
01:05:21,824 --> 01:05:23,157
This is good enough.

1255
01:05:23,449 --> 01:05:24,449
Yeah.

1256
01:05:24,474 --> 01:05:25,940
- Want to try?
- Yes.

1257
01:05:26,746 --> 01:05:28,479
Can you hold it up for me?

1258
01:05:28,558 --> 01:05:29,558
Go!

1259
01:05:29,583 --> 01:05:30,850
- Just run?
- Run!

1260
01:05:30,871 --> 01:05:31,871
This is fun.

1261
01:05:32,003 --> 01:05:33,573
None of the air is going to go in.

1262
01:05:33,598 --> 01:05:36,003
Yeah, run and then tie it!

1263
01:05:36,371 --> 01:05:38,120
How much faster does she have to run?

1264
01:05:38,167 --> 01:05:40,206
- More!
- It's not working!

1265
01:05:42,636 --> 01:05:45,675
This isn't working. It's too hard.

1266
01:05:47,698 --> 01:05:49,386
Don't sit in the middle. Sit on the end.

1267
01:05:49,411 --> 01:05:50,269
- The end?
- Yes.

1268
01:05:50,294 --> 01:05:51,361
Like that and...

1269
01:05:58,660 --> 01:06:01,011
- Don't throw yourself on to it.
- No!

1270
01:06:01,152 --> 01:06:02,698
You told me to sit on the end.

1271
01:06:02,753 --> 01:06:04,956
- Don't throw yourself onto it.
- "No!"

1272
01:06:05,019 --> 01:06:06,552
She's full of cuteness.

1273
01:06:07,542 --> 01:06:08,542
That hurt.

1274
01:06:10,644 --> 01:06:13,444
How come I'm the only one who can't do it?

1275
01:06:13,964 --> 01:06:15,026
Sit down slowly.

1276
01:06:15,035 --> 01:06:16,035
Look.

1277
01:06:16,909 --> 01:06:18,159
- It's good, right?
- Yes.

1278
01:06:18,184 --> 01:06:19,604
- Slowly.
- Okay, got it.

1279
01:06:19,621 --> 01:06:22,362
You can't get your balance if you sit down quickly.

1280
01:06:22,402 --> 01:06:24,784
There you go. Slowly.
Get your balance.

1281
01:06:24,824 --> 01:06:25,824
But...

1282
01:06:27,152 --> 01:06:28,636
What? It's perfect.

1283
01:06:31,667 --> 01:06:33,534
Let's look at the stars now.

1284
01:06:33,753 --> 01:06:36,753
I smell the countryside and campfire.

1285
01:06:37,495 --> 01:06:39,228
I get what it smells like.

1286
01:06:40,082 --> 01:06:41,854
Have you looked at the stars laying down?

1287
01:06:41,886 --> 01:06:44,839
I don't think I ever have,
now that I think about it.

1288
01:06:44,917 --> 01:06:46,784
So today is your first time.

1289
01:06:52,058 --> 01:06:53,791
Were you waiting for a while?

1290
01:06:54,871 --> 01:06:55,871
This is nice.

1291
01:06:56,605 --> 01:06:58,605
But I can't hit you with them.

1292
01:07:02,042 --> 01:07:04,714
This place is a little far from Seoul so...

1293
01:07:04,753 --> 01:07:07,620
- There are stars.
- We can see the stars.

1294
01:07:17,720 --> 01:07:19,894
What do you think about Kyung-hoon so far?

1295
01:07:19,919 --> 01:07:21,177
I like him.

1296
01:07:21,456 --> 01:07:22,925
I like him too.

1297
01:07:22,950 --> 01:07:25,075
Right? He seems like a really good guy.

1298
01:07:25,100 --> 01:07:29,567
I think the two go well together
because he seems dependable.

1299
01:07:29,880 --> 01:07:32,145
Joo-yeon's cute charm is...

1300
01:07:32,263 --> 01:07:34,729
I think he's close to her ideal type.

1301
01:07:35,630 --> 01:07:37,230
They look good together.

1302
01:07:40,598 --> 01:07:43,265
I let the alcohol to go away on purpose.

1303
01:07:44,380 --> 01:07:48,239
You boil fruits with wine and drink it warm.

1304
01:07:48,270 --> 01:07:49,804
I've never heard of it.

1305
01:07:54,333 --> 01:07:55,535
This is good.

1306
01:07:55,841 --> 01:07:58,848
What did you think about our second date?

1307
01:07:59,130 --> 01:08:02,463
It was a lot more comfortable than the first date.

1308
01:08:03,325 --> 01:08:04,692
- It was comfortable and...
- Seriously.

1309
01:08:04,731 --> 01:08:06,797
Her cheeks are flushed already.

1310
01:08:06,911 --> 01:08:10,168
I feel like we've gotten closer.

1311
01:08:10,309 --> 01:08:11,637
We felt that too.

1312
01:08:11,661 --> 01:08:13,332
We really liked it.

1313
01:08:13,739 --> 01:08:18,551
We did a lot more together than last time.

1314
01:08:18,786 --> 01:08:21,309
And talked a lot.

1315
01:08:21,380 --> 01:08:22,380
Right.

1316
01:08:23,927 --> 01:08:28,082
It felt like we understand each other better.

1317
01:08:28,442 --> 01:08:31,309
- You're right.
- That's why we feel more comfortable.

1318
01:08:31,434 --> 01:08:34,434
- This is your second time seeing me.
- Yes.

1319
01:08:34,661 --> 01:08:36,926
What did you say about my first impression again?

1320
01:08:36,950 --> 01:08:39,848
This is her first time asking something like that, right?

1321
01:08:39,895 --> 01:08:45,293
I think there were more pure sides to you than I expected.

1322
01:08:45,957 --> 01:08:55,707
I thought you'd have a strong mentality and be really opinionated.

1323
01:08:56,044 --> 01:09:01,207
But when I met you, I saw sides that were opposite to that.

1324
01:09:01,614 --> 01:09:04,051
So I thought, "She has these sides to her too."

1325
01:09:04,076 --> 01:09:07,325
Yeah. He read her well.

1326
01:09:07,927 --> 01:09:10,393
What do you think about me as a girl?

1327
01:09:10,895 --> 01:09:12,637
This is the most important part.

1328
01:09:12,716 --> 01:09:15,856
I think I have to be careful with my words.

1329
01:09:16,145 --> 01:09:19,192
They're talking about their very honest feelings right now.

1330
01:09:19,223 --> 01:09:20,879
They're very serious right now.

1331
01:09:20,904 --> 01:09:23,037
When was your last relationship?

1332
01:09:24,489 --> 01:09:26,668
- Two years ago.
- Two years ago?

1333
01:09:26,997 --> 01:09:30,817
I think new relationships are getting harder.

1334
01:09:30,842 --> 01:09:32,442
Yeah, as you grow older.

1335
01:09:32,512 --> 01:09:35,646
I think she's thinking about it very carefully.

1336
01:09:37,340 --> 01:09:40,176
I used to think that I wanted to get married.

1337
01:09:40,239 --> 01:09:44,972
But after that phase passed,
it's been hard forming new relationships.

1338
01:09:45,332 --> 01:09:49,106
So I think I do observe the person more.

1339
01:09:49,496 --> 01:09:53,145
What about you? What are you like?

1340
01:09:53,380 --> 01:10:02,285
I also do think that I need to be in a stable relationship with marriage in mind.

1341
01:10:02,606 --> 01:10:05,739
Because of our age, right?

1342
01:10:06,005 --> 01:10:08,973
I think you always ruin things if you rush it.

1343
01:10:09,973 --> 01:10:14,348
I think things that start too quickly
end quickly.

1344
01:10:14,802 --> 01:10:18,465
If you like someone too fast,
those feelings go away quickly.

1345
01:10:18,544 --> 01:10:19,544
You're right.

1346
01:10:19,958 --> 01:10:20,958
Yes.

1347
01:10:21,598 --> 01:10:25,653
The topic is definitely different from what Seok-hee or Soo-bin talk about.

1348
01:10:25,848 --> 01:10:27,051
Completely different.

1349
01:10:27,076 --> 01:10:33,903
Because they're thinking about marriage,
they can't just easily say they like someone.

1350
01:10:34,083 --> 01:10:35,483
They're more careful.

1351
01:10:35,508 --> 01:10:38,226
Since they're older, they're very serious

1352
01:10:38,302 --> 01:10:42,535
and they want to go slowly instead of moving too fast.

1353
01:10:45,105 --> 01:10:49,785
I think they could get closer by talking about this.

1354
01:10:50,036 --> 01:10:52,614
I relate to it because it's
different from the time

1355
01:10:52,639 --> 01:10:55,216
you take to get to know
someone when you're younger.

1356
01:10:55,241 --> 01:10:58,285
When you're younger, you get to know someone based on feelings.

1357
01:10:58,364 --> 01:11:08,051
But now you think about if you can accept even the other person's flaws.

1358
01:11:17,333 --> 01:11:23,504
I'd like to see you more.

1359
01:11:25,255 --> 01:11:27,788
Let's meet again when we're both free.

1360
01:11:28,403 --> 01:11:29,603
That sounds good.

1361
01:11:30,138 --> 01:11:31,138
Okay.

1362
01:11:39,005 --> 01:11:40,637
I'm so curious!

1363
01:11:41,028 --> 01:11:44,457
- What do you think as her father?
- We'd like to know.

1364
01:11:44,482 --> 01:11:46,871
I'm sure it will work out if it's meant to be.

1365
01:11:46,927 --> 01:11:48,060
That's important.

1366
01:11:48,520 --> 01:11:50,746
Do you want her to get married soon?

1367
01:11:50,771 --> 01:11:51,942
No.

1368
01:11:52,638 --> 01:11:55,168
But we always have a special episode!

1369
01:11:55,263 --> 01:11:58,254
- We have one this time too.
- Yeah, we have one this time too.

1370
01:11:58,279 --> 01:11:59,668
We can find out then.

1371
01:11:59,693 --> 01:12:03,160
We're rooting for the daughters' lovely dating lives!

1372
01:12:05,669 --> 01:12:08,090
There are only two people I want to depend on.

1373
01:12:08,115 --> 01:12:11,332
We think they're dating by now.

1374
01:12:13,286 --> 01:12:14,286
What?

1375
01:12:15,442 --> 01:12:17,020
It's upsetting.

1376
01:12:19,286 --> 01:12:20,489
This is crazy.

1377
01:12:20,598 --> 01:12:21,700
What a man.

1378
01:12:21,739 --> 01:12:25,339
There was no reason to not like him through the clips.

1379
01:12:29,207 --> 01:12:32,098
I'm about to cry too because you're crying.

1380
01:12:32,731 --> 01:12:34,028
I'm happy.
