1
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:07,120
What do you do?

2
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:08,680
I am a lawyer.

3
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:10,300
Oh~

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:12,660
Do you like to watch zombie movies?

5
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:17,620
Woah, you are very passionate.

6
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:28,540
&lt;When man and woman who both likes zombie movies meet each other&gt;

7
00:00:29,740 --> 00:00:30,900
[Ko Seung Woo, 33 Years Old, Attorney at Law]
For this time,

8
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:33,920
[Ko Seung Woo, 33 Years Old, Attorney at Law]
I would like the conversation to flow well.

9
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:39,860
[Kim Na Young, 26 Years Old, Actress Trainee]
I was so nervous at first time.

10
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:43,260
I would like to talk to him more

11
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:44,940
this time since this is the second.

12
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:49,640
I would like to meet a woman

13
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:56,480
who likes her job and does her best in it once again.

14
00:00:57,720 --> 00:00:59,480
Uhm, someone with

15
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:03,440
big personality and big shoulder but cute face?

16
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:05,500
That kind of style?

17
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:08,300
-Hello

18
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:09,280
-Hello
-Hello

19
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:11,360

I am 26 years old.

21
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:16,340
Oh, I am 33 years old.

22
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:18,000
Ah okay Hello again

23
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,700
Yes hello

24
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:22,360
Q. What do you do?

25
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:24,460
I am a lawyer.

26
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:26,600
Ah, I see

27
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:30,600
This is the first time I have met someone

28
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:32,620
who works in that industry.

29
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:35,240
What about you?

30
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:38,120
I majored in Drama

31
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:40,500
and working as an actress.

32
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:43,760
I have just moved to Seoul.

33
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:46,120
Where is your hometown?

34
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:47,420
Mine was Busan.

35
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:49,080
Ah~ Busan it is.

36
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:50,100
Yes.

37
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:51,660
Mine too is Busan.

38
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:52,700
Oh really?

39
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:53,200
Yes

40
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,000
Oh~

41
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:55,600
In Dongnae-gu

42
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:56,300
Yes

43
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:57,160
Nangmin-dong

44
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:59,320
I am from Nangmin-dong.

45
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:02,700
For real?

46
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:05,860
It is a place where people from Busan is not even that familiar with.

47
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:10,660
I was born there and lived for a few years then moved to Seoul.

48
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:13,280
So it is my hometown.

49
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,740
I was surprised to hear of the word ‘Nangmin-dong

50
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:18,980
Because

51
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:23,080
Most people from Busan are not familiar with that place.

52
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:27,280
So I did not expect to hear it from him till then.

53
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,460
I felt close to him.

54
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:32,540
Q. Do you love what you are doing?

55
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:35,900
You do enough to continue to do it?

56
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:41,300
I thought of doing something else after graduating college.

57
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:44,440
But I made up my mind and moved to Seoul to do this.

58
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,620
So I will put my heart to it.

59
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:49,000
Even if it would be a hard way.

60
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:52,460
Whoa, you are very passionate.

61
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:58,580
I felt that she did not treat her job lightly

62
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:01,220
when hearing her words

63
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:04,260
of deciding to move to Seoul from Busan,

64
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:07,660
where she has spent her life.

65
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:10,140
It is definitely not a easy decision to make.

66
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:11,720
She is eager,

67
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:14,840
focused and passionate,

68
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:16,960
which has made her to come here.

69
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:19,100
I think that is very brave of her.

70
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:23,320
Q. What do you think is most important in a relationship?

71
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,320
To respect the personal time

72
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:26,580
and personal space,

73
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:32,380
while to cherish the moments spent together.

74
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,980
It can be very hard on each other when these two collide.

75
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:38,400
So I think it is important to respect the personal boundaries

76
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:42,480
while to cherish the moments that are spent together.

77
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:44,780
So yes that is me.

78
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:45,940
Yes.

79
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:48,240
Q. What is your blood type?

80
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,480
Mine is type B.

81
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:51,720
Ah…

82
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:52,380
Yes.

83
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:55,300
I see.

84
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,720
Why blood type?

85
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:02,540
I do not like Blood type theories that much.

86
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:05,380
It may be because I am a type B

87
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:07,360
and most women do not like

88
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:11,120
men who are type B. I am not sure why.

89
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,380
And secondly,

90
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:16,720
it seems it is not based on scientific data

91
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:20,120
but rather for fun

92
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:23,600
Q. What is your personality like?

93
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,300
I tend to keep silence at home.

94
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:30,020
It is very important for me to have some quiet time alone,

95
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:33,020
which may seem that I am an internal person.

96
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:37,720
But when I go out, I am very outgoing.

97
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:41,280
Are you a quiet person at home?

98
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,580
I do not talk much at home.

99
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,920
I am also a quiet type at home.

100
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:56,080
So I would like to meet a person

101
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,240
who talks more at home.

102
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:01,580
So I moved backwards.

103
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:06,720
Q. Do you enjoy watching Horror, or Zombie movies?

104
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:08,460
Oh,

105
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:11,500
I love watching Zombie movies.

106
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:12,600
Oh really?

107
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:16,700
What is your favorite film?

108
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,540
From zombie movies?

109
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:20,620
My favorite was ‘Dawn of the Dead’.

110
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:22,700
First time I’ve seen was when I was little.

111
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:24,220
It was so good that I watched twice.

112
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:25,560
It is a work of art.

113
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:27,420
It is a textbook

114
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:28,520
for how zombie movies should be made.

115
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:30,340
You love zombie movies too?

116
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:34,780
In college, I loved watching them,

117
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,080
especially those of George Romero

118
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:39,320
from the 80s

119
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:42,240
Dawn of the Dead is like a textbook

120
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:44,420
for a modern zombie movies.

121
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:46,520
2004 release, right?

122
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:48,000
Terrific movie.

123
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:51,460
You really love watching them.

124
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,180
Yes I do.

125
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,800
Yes, I used to be really into

126
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,560
those horror and zombie movies.

127
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:59,040
in Senior year in college?

128
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:01,780
After I finished submitting the thesis and had nothing to do

129
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,620
I binge-watched horror movies.

130
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,920
But the ones I liked

131
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:10,060
were not women’s favorite of course.

132
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:15,780
So I thought that side of her was good.

133
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:19,680
Q. Then the best movie in your life must be Dawn of the Dead?

134
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:25,020
I love that film but it is not the best movie of my life.

135
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,200
Q. then what is yours?

136
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:28,660
My favorite is

137
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:33,020
Constantine, starring Keanue Reeves.

138
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:34,680
Is it a war film?

139
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:36,120
No, it is not a war film.

140
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:39,100
I am interested in those supernatural stuffs,

141
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:42,300
like spiritual thing, angels and demons.

142
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,180
Ah~

143
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:48,480
This film is based on comic book series.

144
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,820
Adapted from that series.

145
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:50,720
Yes

146
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,560
As it was being adapted by a film

147
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:56,180
the main character’s name ‘Constantine’ was still used

148
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:58,180
it is a great film. You must watch it.

149
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:01,080
I have watched it more than 7 times.

150
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:03,060
He was very excited when explaining it.

151
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:04,580
He was very adorable.

152
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:07,160
It was very fun listening to his story.

153
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:10,680
It seems like he really likes that film

154
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,500
and is very much into it.

155
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,560
I felt attracted to him.

156
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,460
So I loved forward several steps.

157
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:20,280
Q. What is your like and dislike

158
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:22,320
for food?

159
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:27,160
I like lamb ribs.

160
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:29,680
I like them.

161
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,600
And also grilled large intestines.

162
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:35,700
Grilled large intestines?

163
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:36,540
Large intestines, yes.

164
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:42,440
Q. Do you have hard time deciding what to eat

165
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:45,440
or do it quickly?

166
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:48,220
I do it quickly.

167
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:50,380
Ah~ I see.

168
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:58,560
Q. Do you prefer to go and visit hot crowded places

169
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:05,820
or to rest and enjoy the nature?

170
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:12,420
I do not enjoy that much from being relaxed in the nature.

171
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:13,560
Ah~

172
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:17,060
I really do not prefer that.

173
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:18,700
Ah…

174
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:22,080
I do not like

175
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:24,700
those scenery in nature.

176
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:27,140
It must be metropolitan.

177
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:32,740
I have been in Marines.

178
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,200
I have spent 6 months in the sea.

179
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:39,900
Then I got sick of the sea.

180
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,240
Ah I see how you got there.

181
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:43,880
What about mountains?

182
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:46,020
I hadn’t liked it once.

183
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:47,260
Ah…

184
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:49,840
I hate climbing.

185
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:52,960
Ah, I really do not like that.

186
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:55,240
If he had said ‘I like it but it is not my favorite’

187
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:57,520
I would have stayed there not moving

188
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:59,900
but he has shown his disgust in it very clearly

189
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:03,780
Q. Which famous person do you respect,

190
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:06,660
or like?

191
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,060
For my career wise,

192
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:11,440
there is a person called ‘Kim Young Moo’.

193
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,580
I respect that kind of person very much.

194
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:17,840
He is the founding partner of the best law firm in Korea, Kim &amp; Chang.

195
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:20,600
He is my role model for career.

196
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,400
For celebrity, there are so many.

197
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:25,420
Uhm,

198
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:27,260
For a special interest,

199
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:30,600
I am not sure if you know

200
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:33,180
‘ChulGu’, famous Afreeca TV BJ (Live Video Streaming Service)

201
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:34,300
Ah yes.

202
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:37,100
He has always been the center of issues lately, has been on a news

203
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:38,760
been doing something very weird but

204
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:42,960
He was the one of the founding members of live streaming Video service BJ.

205
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:47,820
I get what you mean by that.

206
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:52,900
He used to be a pro-gamer (Starcraft).

207
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:54,880
Yes I know.

208
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:58,480
He used to BJ the gaming TV.

209
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,480
Gaming TV?

210
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:01,400
Yes.

211
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:05,560
She has shown her interest in what I’ve mentioned.

212
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:06,780
It got me excited.

213
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:09,760
That sort of feeling?

214
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:13,580
sort of lamb rib?

215
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:18,080
Q. What was the average term of relationships you’ve had?

216
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:21,500
Most of them were long term or short term?

217
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,920
Most of them were not long term.

218
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,520
If it was a long one, it lasted a year.

219
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:29,080
For short one, less than 6 months.

220
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:33,200
There have been terms in-between.

221
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:37,420
Yes…it had been that way.

222
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:38,320
I see.

223
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:41,100
I think you must see a person for certain amount of time

224
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:44,440
to get to know that person, rather than seeing one after one repeatedly.

225
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:47,700
I do not think it is a good to see one after one repeatedly.

226
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:53,680
Q. There are a person who leads and another being led.

227
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:57,480
Which side you tend to be?

228
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:04,100
I tend to be a person who leads.

229
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:05,660
Oh really?

230
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:09,400
I say it straightforward

231
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:13,560
if I want something to be done.

232
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:16,080
I did not hide my feeling.

233
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:19,660
Ah I see.

234
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:25,580
Blind-Date Finished

235
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:29,020
Now it is a time to check each other out!

236
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:42,080
Hello

237
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,400
Hello

238
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,320
Nice to meet you.

239
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:53,200
I would like us to have more conversation.

240
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:54,860
The time is very limited.

241
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:56,240
Yes I feel the same way.

242
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,760
Nangmin-dong?

243
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,980
Yes. How do you know Nangmin-dong?

244
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:02,320
My grandmother still lives there.

245
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,760
Wow what a coincidence.

246
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:07,940
Q. (During Blind-Date) How do you feel?
He led the conversation very well.

247
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:12,540
So I felt comfortable enough to get along.

248
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:18,500
I felt the need to have more conversation with her when

249
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:23,220
I felt that she was nervous

250
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,920
because she is younger than me

251
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:32,640
Q. How do you feel after checking each other out?
During a blind date, he appealed his opinion strongly

252
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:37,340
so I expected to see a strong looking man

253
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:41,740
but he looked very soft

254
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:45,560
It was absolutely different from what I expected.

255
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:49,140
She is pretty.

256
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:54,160
but

257
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:58,240
not close to my type?

258
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:01,960
but she is adorable.

259
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:08,700
I did not know the session would end that quickly

260
00:13:08,780 --> 00:13:12,320
and after I saw my standing position at just where I started.

261
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:15,160
I felt very…
