00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,400
MISSION - EYE CONTACT FOR FIVE SECONDS

2
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:04,400
Five seconds?

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:04,900
Yes.

4
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:08,580
One, two, three!

5
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:20,020
Wasn't that more than five seconds?

6
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:29,740
Hello.

7
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:32,980
My name is Won Jae Hyeong.

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,140
I am Kim Cha Ron.

9
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:39,340
Nice to meet you.

10
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:41,920
Can you drink well?

11
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:43,500
I like to drink.

12
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:44,560
Oh, you like to drink?

13
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:45,280
Yes.

14
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:47,380
Do you shake the bottle?

15
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:48,860
I just open it.

16
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:52,140
The glass is pretty.

17
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:02,900
Have you done a lot of blind dates before?

18
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:04,380
No, not a lot.

19
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,500
This is my first time...

20
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:08,520
Oh, this is your very first blind date?

21
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:09,820
Yes this is my very first time.

22
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:11,660
So I'm a bit nervous.

23
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:14,200
This is your first time and you applied to be on this series?

24
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:18,400
Yeah, I was bit drunk when I applied for this.

25
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:20,020
Same here.

26
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:21,360
Oh really?

27
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:27,560
How old are you?

28
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:28,980
I'm 26 years old.

29
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:31,160
Oh 26 years old?

30
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:32,440
I'm 27 years old.

31
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,840
Ah~ you look very young.

32
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:38,380
I'm not sure if it's because you are nervous,

33
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:40,880
but you look younger than your age.

34
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:42,020
Maybe.

35
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,840
BETWEEN A JAPANESE RESTAURANT CHEF OR A CEO OF A ONLINE SHOPPING MALL, JAE HYEONG'S JOB IS _________.

36
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:53,460
CEO of a online shopping mall?

37
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:54,160
Yes.

38
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:55,620
That's correct?

39
00:01:56,780 --> 00:01:57,720
I see.

40
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,520
At first, I thought you were a college student.

41
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:01,880
Really?

42
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:05,980
At first I thought you were doing something in the arts.

43
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:09,560
I get that kind of vibe from you.

44
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:11,000
Oh really?

45
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,340
I studied traditional Korean dance.

46
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:15,280
Have you seen a performance before?

47
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,800
No, I've never seen a performance before.

48
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:17,820
Oh really?

49
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:18,680
Yes.

50
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:19,920
That's possible.

51
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,640
I'll invite you next time.

52
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:26,280
I'll go no matter what.

53
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:31,600
THE BLOOD TYPE THAT CHA RON AVOIDS IN A MAN IS ____ TYPE.

54
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:32,820
Blood type-A

55
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:34,380
Correct~

56
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:35,060
Am I correct?

57
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,080
You aren't?

58
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:39,740
Yes. I'm blood type-B.

59
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:40,520
Oh~

60
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,960
What's your blood type?

61
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,280
I'm blood type-A.

62
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,500
Oh. You're blood type-A,

63
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:46,620
but you don't like blood type-A...

64
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:49,940
Blood type-As tend to analyze everything,

65
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:53,540
think too much, and are sensitive.

66
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:56,800
And I found that kind of characteristics didn't match with me.

67
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,760
It's because I am the type to act first.

68
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,180
Oh I see.

69
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:03,220
You don't avoid dating any blood type?

70
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,780
I think it's blood type-B.

71
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:06,720
How come?

72
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,760
We tend to argue a lot.

73
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:12,460
I wonder if it's because we're both kind of stubborn

74
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:14,100
You don't like that type?

75
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:16,900
I like someone who is strongly opinionated.

76
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:17,860
Oh, I see.

77
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:19,940
I like blood type-B.

78
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:21,680
Oh, really? Thank goodness.

79
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:23,500
What?

80
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:25,240
No nothing LOL

81
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:30,740
CHA RON'S LAST RELATIONSHIP WAS ______ YEARS AGO.

82
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I’m guessing 1 year ago.

83
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:38,300
Oh, seems like I need to give you a shot.

84
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,840
Then, how long has it been?

85
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:44,600
It's been a while. 3 years.

86
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:45,780
Oh really?

87
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:47,500
What happened?

88
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:49,720
Hahaha~ What happened?!

89
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:52,560
Sorry, my bad. Did I make a mistake?

90
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:55,300
You're very beautiful

91
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:56,800
so I'm wondering why.

92
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,760
Have you been asked out before?

93
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:00,500
Oh, I've had.

94
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:04,080
But I start my schedule very early in the morning

95
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,500
and end very late at night

96
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:09,820
so it's very hard for them to understand that.

97
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:12,120
Do you mean practice schedule?

98
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:16,780
Yes. As time passes and as there's more practice hours, it just didn’t work out.

99
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:20,120
It's been a year and half for me since my last relationship.

100
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:22,140
One year and half?

101
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:22,820
Yes.

102
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:27,520
That's still quite a bit of time.

103
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:29,120
Right.

104
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,800
My last relationship was hard for me.

105
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:33,940
So I didn’t

106
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:36,080
I mean couldn’t start another relationship

107
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,460
and then after time passed and being single for a while,

108
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:42,120
I don't know exactly how to please women now.

109
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:44,900
Mmm...

110
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:48,520
So you didn't have any flings during that time?

111
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:50,140
I had

112
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:53,240
but I was unskilled in a way...

113
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:54,320
You guys broke up?...

114
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,080
Right...

115
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:58,380
Ah, are you usually dumped?

116
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:00,420
Yes, I've been dumped by all.

117
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:05,000
You are laughing too much

118
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:12,720
BETWEEN A SCHEDULED DATE AND A SPONTANEOUS IMPROMPTU DATE, CHA RON PREFERS _________.

119
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,400
A scheduled date.

120
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:17,120
Wrong.

121
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:19,780
I like more impromptu dates.

122
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:22,640
Because of your schedule..

123
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:25,180
My schedule is very fluid,

124
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:31,020
so when we meet, I say "I want to go and do this" and we go and do that.

125
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:33,400
Do you plan your dates?

126
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:36,580
No. It depends on the mood.

127
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:37,820
For instance,

128
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:40,460
you're feeling down today,

129
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:41,960
then where would you go?

130
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:44,460
Go eat something delicious somewhere?

131
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:45,940
To brighten your mood?

132
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:48,360
Yes, to try and make my date feel better.

133
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,980
No, I mean when you are feeling down.

134
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:50,640
Oh me?

135
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:54,020
I don't think I've ever felt like that.

136
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:56,900
Your mood is always great?

137
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:59,540
I always feel great when I'm with my girlfriend.

138
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,540
That's... That's the right answer.

139
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:02,480
Ah really?

140
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:08,580
CHA RON CAN OR CANNOT LET HER BOYFRIEND GO DRINK WITH OTHER WOMEN.

141
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:09,660
Cannot

142
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:10,700
*laughs*

143
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:11,740
I'm right, huh?

144
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:12,680
You're right.

145
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,540
But if there's a person you like,

146
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:18,520
isn't it right to be jealous?

147
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,540
I think that's right.

148
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:22,820
Oh, but do I look like the jealous type?

149
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:23,940
Yes.

150
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:25,280
*staff giggles*

151
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:28,500
Did I make a mistake?

152
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:29,160
No, you didn't.

153
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,480
Everyone is…

154
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:32,360
It's not like I cursed.

155
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:36,260
Well, hmm. How do I say this?

156
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:38,580
You seem to be passionate about your work

157
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:45,460
and therefore you seem to be passionate about what's yours so...

158
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:48,100
That doesn't sound like a very good personality.

159
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:50,000
No, I like that.

160
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:53,000
I prefer that kind of personality.

161
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,680
Oh like I am considerate and think of them that much.

162
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,300
Yes, I think I will feel that way.

163
00:06:57,580 --> 00:07:00,780
For instance, people say even if they are in a relationship, they feel lonely.. you know?

164
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:01,620
Yes.

165
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:05,320
So you probably want your boyfriend to express a lot..

166
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:08,140
Do you express a lot?

167
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:12,760
Usually guys don't text when they're eating.

168
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:14,000
Do you?

169
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,980
I tend to send pictures.

170
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:17,800
Like to validate what you're doing?

171
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:20,680
No, but more like telling her 'I'm eating this'

172
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:23,140
and just sharing each other's daily life constantly

173
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:31,880
so we can empathize together and converse with each other therefore we would get more intimate. I think...

174
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:34,640
I think your girlfriend will like it.

175
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:39,080
It's been a year and half, so I'm not even sure.

176
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:45,380
Then would you let your girlfriend go for a drink with other guys?

177
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,800
Usually, I'd say it's okay,

178
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,820
but if I'm answering for you, I wouldn’t allow it.

179
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:51,140
What kind of answer is that?

180
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:55,640
You're so attractive,

181
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:57,380
I just...

182
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:00,460
I'd probably feel... You know...

183
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:03,180
But if I had to give you permission...

184
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:04,820
What's your limit?

185
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:07,560
Until lunch.

186
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:09,540
No dinner.

187
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:12,360
No drinking at all.

188
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,680
Before sun set?

189
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:14,700
Before sun set.

190
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:21,780
CHA RON REALLY WANTS TO BE IN THE RELATIONSHIP WHEN ______.

191
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:23,680
When you drink?

192
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:26,060
You want to be in a relationship when you're drinking?

193
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:30,720
When I come home after work and have a beer,

194
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:35,260
I think it'd be nice to be able to enjoy it with my girlfriend.

195
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:38,840
How about you?

196
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:46,960
These days, I want to enjoy my hobbies with my boyfriend.

197
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:52,360
Everyone around me is currently in a relationship

198
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:54,080
That's these days?

199
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:54,760
Yes.

200
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:57,540
They have times when they fight,

201
00:08:57,540 --> 00:08:59,680
but also time when they're having a great time

202
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:03,580
and that's when I feel jealous.

203
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:11,880
JAE HYEONG HAVE TO GO ON _____DATES TO DECIDE IF HE WANTS TO BE IN A RELATIONSHIP?

204
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:13,520
4 times?

205
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:16,120
That's very close.

206
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:17,440
Is it 5 times?

207
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:22,400
3 times.

208
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:24,000
Why 3 times?

209
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:28,940
Well, when you first meet, image is almost everything you see.

210
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:30,340
Mmmm...

211
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:33,300
The second time you meet,

212
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,500
you've conversed by this point,

213
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:38,580
I think you can kind of see their personality.

214
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:39,740
And the third time,

215
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:42,620
it's the day I've made my decision.

216
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:46,120
And the fourth time, you would pop the question?

217
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:50,040
Yes, but if I can't hold back my feelings, I'll probably ask her out before three times.

218
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:53,920
Last one.

219
00:09:56,820 --> 00:10:01,020
COMPARED TO THE FIRST MOMENT CHA RON HAS SAME / DIFFERENT FEELINGS TOWARD JAE HYEONG.

220
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:03,220
I think it's different

221
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:05,040
Different?

222
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,700
In what context?

223
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:10,760
Since we were able to have a lot of conversation,

224
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:14,640
I think it's changed from so-so to...

225
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:17,740
You think right now I have better feeling about you?

226
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:19,460
Am I wrong?

227
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,620
No, you're right.

228
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:27,580
Then can I ask what your first impression of me was?

229
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:30,120
Mm.. it was very good.

230
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,980
Oh~ really?

231
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,840
The more we talked,

232
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:38,920
you seemed like a good person so I had good vibes

233
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:43,400
Oh~~ That's good.

234
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:49,760
How many more times do you want to see me?

235
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,320
Today is the first time,

236
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,440
so two more times, and I think I can decide.

237
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:56,740
So, that's exactly 3 times.

238
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,500
Maybe I think I'll know after meeting just one more time.

239
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:07,280
I'll pour you a shot.

240
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:11,940
Let's....

241
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:18,940
toast to getting over singlehood.
