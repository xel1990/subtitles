1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:01,980
Dan: Hello.

2
00:00:01,980 --> 00:00:03,510
Vanessa: Hello, hello.

3
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:10,380
Welcome to today's live English lesson here
on the wonderful Speak English with Vanessa

4
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:12,150
YouTube channel page.

5
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:13,150
Thank you for joining me.

6
00:00:13,150 --> 00:00:15,260
I'm Vanessa and this is my husband, Dan.

7
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:16,410
Dan: I'm Dan.

8
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:17,480
You might know me well.

9
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:18,480
Vanessa: Yes.

10
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:23,269
Dan is going to help today to explain three
valuable English expressions.

11
00:00:23,269 --> 00:00:24,749
One of them is a phrasal verb.

12
00:00:24,749 --> 00:00:27,029
One of them is an idiom and what's the last
one?

13
00:00:27,029 --> 00:00:28,839
Dan: We got slang as well.

14
00:00:28,839 --> 00:00:30,169
We like slang around here.

15
00:00:30,169 --> 00:00:34,030
Vanessa: Yes, so we're hopefully help you
to expand your vocabulary and also just see

16
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:39,559
some specific examples when you can use this
in your daily conversations or in your writing

17
00:00:39,559 --> 00:00:42,610
or in your job or in your travels, anytime
that you use English.

18
00:00:42,610 --> 00:00:45,510
If you're joining us live, thanks so much.

19
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:49,469
Let us know where you're from and let us know
in the chat box.

20
00:00:49,469 --> 00:00:54,359
We're going to be asking a lot of questions
today so make sure that you interact and participate.

21
00:00:54,359 --> 00:00:56,280
You can write out the questions.

22
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:00,059
You can write out your answers even if you're
not watching live, if you're watching the

23
00:01:00,059 --> 00:01:02,059
replay, you can do the same thing.

24
00:01:02,059 --> 00:01:03,120
Write out the questions.

25
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:04,580
Write out your own answers.

26
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:08,579
Try to use these because that's the best way
to remember what you're learning.

27
00:01:08,579 --> 00:01:14,450
Dan: Yes, and a happy, early, Merry Christmas,
if anybody has noticed our Christmas tree

28
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:15,450
back here.

29
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:16,450
Vanessa: Yes.

30
00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:17,450
Dan: I love Christmas.

31
00:01:17,450 --> 00:01:18,450
It's my favorite time of year.

32
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:22,030
Vanessa: Yeah so we decided to open the door
so that you could get a little sneak preview

33
00:01:22,030 --> 00:01:23,110
of our Christmas tree.

34
00:01:23,110 --> 00:01:24,330
That was Dan's idea.

35
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:25,330
Thanks.

36
00:01:25,330 --> 00:01:26,330
Dan: Yes.

37
00:01:26,330 --> 00:01:27,330
You need the sneak preview.

38
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:28,330
Vanessa: Yes.

39
00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:29,330
Yes.

40
00:01:29,330 --> 00:01:31,150
Thank you, everyone who's joining us from
Mexico, India, Brazil.

41
00:01:31,150 --> 00:01:32,229
Dan: Japan.

42
00:01:32,229 --> 00:01:33,840
Vanessa: Yemen, Columbia.

43
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:34,920
Dan: Egypt.

44
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:36,000
Vanessa: Hungary.

45
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,500
Thank you so much for joining us.

46
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:39,539
Peru, Turkey, Morocco.

47
00:01:39,539 --> 00:01:40,539
Wow.

48
00:01:40,539 --> 00:01:41,630
Dan: Kurdistan, never been there.

49
00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:43,390
Vanessa: From everywhere.

50
00:01:43,390 --> 00:01:44,690
Everywhere around the world.

51
00:01:44,690 --> 00:01:45,690
Thanks so much.

52
00:01:45,690 --> 00:01:48,140
I'd like to start by asking you the first
question.

53
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:49,140
Dan: Okay.

54
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:53,609
Vanessa: My first question is, what has to
do with something that happened this week.

55
00:01:53,609 --> 00:02:01,220
We had a friend who invited us to an escape
room for her birthday but I had never heard

56
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:04,070
of that so could you explain it to me?

57
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:08,400
What's in an escape room, because if my friend's
inviting me there for her birthday, I want

58
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,660
to know what I'm going to do.

59
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:10,660
Dan: Yeah.

60
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:14,380
An escape room, I don't know if they do this
in other countries yet, but it's started to

61
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:20,630
get kind of popular in America so you actually
pay to get locked up in a room.

62
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:21,630
Vanessa: Yes.

63
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:29,630
Dan: It's filled with puzzles so you have
to, one might say figure out some puzzles.

64
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:36,380
I've done one before and I remember they started
me off in the room in handcuffs with all the

65
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:37,480
lights off.

66
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:39,450
Vanessa: You were with other people or were
you alone?

67
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:40,450
Dan: I was with other people.

68
00:02:40,450 --> 00:02:41,450
Vanessa: Okay.

69
00:02:41,450 --> 00:02:42,520
Dan: It'd be a little scary alone I think.

70
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:45,760
Vanessa: Yeah, I guess you could do it alone
but it's fun as maybe a group activity.

71
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,940
That's why we got invited to a friend's house.

72
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:52,420
Dan: Right, and they call it an escape room
because you're supposed to escape the room,

73
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:54,300
that's the point of the game so I don't know.

74
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:55,650
Do they have that in your countries?

75
00:02:55,650 --> 00:02:59,450
Vanessa: Yeah, are escape rooms becoming popular
in your country?

76
00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:05,090
The kind of principle of this type of activity
is that you have to figure out how to get

77
00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:06,370
out of the room.

78
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:09,030
What is this lovely phrasal verb here?

79
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:10,030
Figure out.

80
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:12,920
Dan: Figure out, that means to learn how to
do something.

81
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:13,920
Vanessa: Yes.

82
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:16,630
Dan: It usually means it's a little difficult.

83
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:18,250
You're working on something.

84
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:21,530
Maybe you have a really hard math problem.

85
00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:24,180
This happened to me all the time when I was
in school.

86
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:28,470
Math was not my strong suit so I had to figure
out how to solve the problem.

87
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:33,020
Vanessa: Yes, you had to figure out so this
kind of implies a process.

88
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:38,070
It's difficult, maybe you have to look from
one resource to the next resource and ask

89
00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:39,070
someone.

90
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:43,600
You have to do some problem solving, kind
of like you can imagine if Dan's in a dark

91
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:49,340
room with his friends, handcuffed, and they
have to figure out how to get out of the room,

92
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:50,930
that involves a process.

93
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:56,590
You have to problem solve and figure out other
things so I want to know for you, my question

94
00:03:56,590 --> 00:04:02,570
for you is when was a time you had to figure
out how to solve a problem.

95
00:04:02,570 --> 00:04:05,180
Dan: You can also say, figure it out.

96
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:08,500
Vanessa: Figure it out, so when would we use
figure it out?

97
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:09,500
Dan: Yeah.

98
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:14,280
If you're already in the process of working
on something, you might just say to yourself,

99
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:16,220
oh, man, I really need to figure it out.

100
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:17,340
Vanessa: Yeah, so the other day.

101
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:18,430
Dan: I need to figure this out.

102
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:24,419
Vanessa: I was in the office, in this room
and I think I made some kind of sound like,

103
00:04:24,419 --> 00:04:27,759
some kind of frustrated sound and you said
from the other room.

104
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:29,210
Hey, Vanessa, are you okay?

105
00:04:29,210 --> 00:04:30,830
I said, I was fine.

106
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:32,510
I'll figure it out.

107
00:04:32,510 --> 00:04:34,430
I didn't tell him any specifics.

108
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:39,870
I didn't say I'm working on this problem on
the website and technical things are sometimes

109
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:40,870
frustrating to me.

110
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:42,159
I didn't give him any details.

111
00:04:42,159 --> 00:04:44,740
I just said, oh, I'll figure it out.

112
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:47,140
Dan: She knew I wouldn't be able to figure
it out so.

113
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:48,950
Vanessa: I didn't want to explain those details.

114
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:51,270
Dan: She figured it out on her own.

115
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:55,830
Vanessa: Yes, so do you think that this is
an expression and a phrasal verb that you

116
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:58,330
could use in a workplace situation?

117
00:04:58,330 --> 00:04:59,330
Dan: Yeah.

118
00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:00,530
Vanessa: If you have some kind of problem?

119
00:05:00,530 --> 00:05:01,530
Dan: Absolutely.

120
00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:02,530
Yeah.

121
00:05:02,530 --> 00:05:07,310
Vanessa: It's useful for those kind of professional
situations, certainly so maybe if you have

122
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:14,650
a problem on some kind of report that you're
working on and you want to ask a coworker

123
00:05:14,650 --> 00:05:15,650
about it.

124
00:05:15,650 --> 00:05:16,919
Dan: Can you help me figure this out?

125
00:05:16,919 --> 00:05:18,789
Vanessa: Figure this out.

126
00:05:18,789 --> 00:05:21,820
Dan: That would be polite and it's acceptable.

127
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:23,069
It's not slang.

128
00:05:23,069 --> 00:05:24,820
Vanessa: Yeah, it's not slang.

129
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:32,129
It can be polite and you can split this phrasal
verb like Dan just did, figure it out or figure

130
00:05:32,129 --> 00:05:39,550
this out or figure this problem out, figure
this thing out so you can split it or you

131
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:40,979
can keep it together, no problem.

132
00:05:40,979 --> 00:05:42,810
We've got two different choices.

133
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:45,969
A lot of you are writing wonderful expressions
here.

134
00:05:45,969 --> 00:05:50,569
I see, Zahira says, I will figure out how
to get confident in English.

135
00:05:50,569 --> 00:05:51,569
Dan: That's a good one.

136
00:05:51,569 --> 00:05:52,569
Vanessa: That is a great one.

137
00:05:52,569 --> 00:05:53,569
Dan: Yeah.

138
00:05:53,569 --> 00:05:56,250
Vanessa: Here, we can kind of imagine that
you're solving the problem.

139
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:59,789
You're working through this issue and you're
going to figure it out.

140
00:05:59,789 --> 00:06:01,039
I will figure it out.

141
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:02,039
I know I'll do it.

142
00:06:02,039 --> 00:06:08,010
Dan: I couldn't figure out what my boss was
talking about as I don't speak Mongolian.

143
00:06:08,010 --> 00:06:09,010
That's a good one too.

144
00:06:09,010 --> 00:06:11,009
I couldn't figure it out, in the negative.

145
00:06:11,009 --> 00:06:15,050
Vanessa: Yes, so when you're using this in
the negative version, just like we saw here

146
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:20,169
in the sample sentence from those of you who
are here live with us, saying I couldn't figure

147
00:06:20,169 --> 00:06:24,440
out what my boss was saying or maybe if you
had an English teacher who just talked way

148
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:30,569
too fast and talked about too many complex
things, then maybe you would say, oh, I can't

149
00:06:30,569 --> 00:06:32,199
figure out what Vanessa is saying.

150
00:06:32,199 --> 00:06:33,650
She's just talking too fast.

151
00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:35,129
Dan: We have a question.

152
00:06:35,129 --> 00:06:36,599
Is find out, similar?

153
00:06:36,599 --> 00:06:38,699
Vanessa: Oh, this is a great question.

154
00:06:38,699 --> 00:06:39,699
Dan: Find out.

155
00:06:39,699 --> 00:06:43,919
Vanessa: I want to give you a little tip,
maybe a year ago, over a year ago or maybe

156
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:46,171
less than a year ago, I'm not sure.

157
00:06:46,171 --> 00:06:50,629
I made a video comparing figure out and find
out.

158
00:06:50,629 --> 00:06:55,479
After this has finished, I'll link this video
up here and then also in the description but

159
00:06:55,479 --> 00:06:58,330
I want you to get some more details about
that.

160
00:06:58,330 --> 00:07:04,090
If I said, I'm going to find out who is at
the door.

161
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:08,550
Dan: That means you're going to discover,
you're going to see, find out.

162
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:12,300
You don't know right now and then you're going
to find out, you're going to discover.

163
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:15,680
Vanessa: It kind of doesn't imply that process.

164
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:18,139
You're searching a difficult thing.

165
00:07:18,139 --> 00:07:20,069
Instead, it's an instant thing like, a-ha.

166
00:07:20,069 --> 00:07:23,059
I opened the door, and I can see who's there.

167
00:07:23,059 --> 00:07:25,099
I'm going to find out who's there.

168
00:07:25,099 --> 00:07:29,409
Dan: Yeah, maybe if you said, I'm going to
figure out who's at the door, maybe you hear

169
00:07:29,409 --> 00:07:34,990
a knock on the door and you look through the
hole and you don't see anybody or maybe somebody

170
00:07:34,990 --> 00:07:38,710
is wearing a mask and then they give you a
puzzle.

171
00:07:38,710 --> 00:07:42,620
Vanessa: Yes, so it is kind of implies a process.

172
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:43,620
Dan: It needs to be more involved.

173
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:45,789
Vanessa: Yes, so if you would like some more
details about figure out versus find out,

174
00:07:45,789 --> 00:07:49,581
feel free to check out that video but in general,
figure out means there's some process, you're

175
00:07:49,581 --> 00:07:52,879
searching, you're figuring out how to do something.

176
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:58,819
We often add how at the end, figure out how
to escape from the room, figure out how to

177
00:07:58,819 --> 00:08:03,180
become a confident English speaker and find
out is just the solution.

178
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:05,639
Find out what is happening.

179
00:08:05,639 --> 00:08:06,729
Find out who is at the door.

180
00:08:06,729 --> 00:08:09,720
Dan: I want to find out what presents are
under my Christmas tree.

181
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,830
Vanessa: Are there any presents under our
Christmas tree?

182
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:13,319
Dan: There are no presents.

183
00:08:13,319 --> 00:08:16,089
Vanessa: maybe someday there will be presents
under the Christmas tree.

184
00:08:16,089 --> 00:08:17,089
Dan: Christmas is ruined.

185
00:08:17,089 --> 00:08:18,889
Vanessa: Oh, well when you have a toddler.

186
00:08:18,889 --> 00:08:19,930
Dan: It's still early.

187
00:08:19,930 --> 00:08:24,539
Vanessa: You can't put Christmas presents
under the tree early.

188
00:08:24,539 --> 00:08:25,919
It's a recipe for getting them opened.

189
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:26,919
Dan: Yes.

190
00:08:26,919 --> 00:08:27,919
Vanessa: All right.

191
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:32,800
I'd like to go to the second expression, which
is an idiom.

192
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:38,229
This past week, our car was doing some kind
of funny things, making some funny sounds

193
00:08:38,229 --> 00:08:41,669
and I noticed that you didn't fix the car
yourself.

194
00:08:41,669 --> 00:08:42,669
Dan: No.

195
00:08:42,669 --> 00:08:43,669
Vanessa: You took it to the mechanic.

196
00:08:43,669 --> 00:08:45,190
Why did you take the car to the mechanic?

197
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:47,070
Dan: Well, I'm not a mechanic.

198
00:08:47,070 --> 00:08:50,030
I'm not very handy.

199
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:52,100
Handy means you can fix a lot of things.

200
00:08:52,100 --> 00:09:00,290
I'm kind of handy but not with cars so I am
in over my head when it comes to fixing cars.

201
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:05,000
I would be in over my head if I tried to fix
my car.

202
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
In over my head.

203
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,500
Vanessa: A lovely idiom.

204
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:09,870
In over my head.

205
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:12,070
We need four words here.

206
00:09:12,070 --> 00:09:13,070
Dan: In what?

207
00:09:13,070 --> 00:09:18,390
Vanessa: Well, we can kind of imagine the
feeling of being overwhelmed.

208
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:24,110
You're completely surrounded or covered in
the problem so here we can imagine Dan opening

209
00:09:24,110 --> 00:09:26,280
the car, trying to fix the problem.

210
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:29,990
He's trying to figure out what's making that
strange sound.

211
00:09:29,990 --> 00:09:31,000
He's trying to look around.

212
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,560
Dan: I'm ripping pieces out of the car.

213
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:33,590
Vanessa: Oh, and he thinks, oh, it's going
to be a disaster.

214
00:09:33,590 --> 00:09:40,710
I should just go to the mechanic because I
am in over my head.

215
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:42,360
It's a problem that's too big.

216
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:46,990
Dan: You can think of swimming in the ocean.

217
00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:49,750
If you're drowning, the waters over your head.

218
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:50,750
You're in trouble.

219
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:51,750
Vanessa: Yes.

220
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:52,750
Dan: You're you're struggling.

221
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:54,050
Vanessa: I think that's a great image.

222
00:09:54,050 --> 00:09:56,120
Dan: I think this is where this comes from.

223
00:09:56,120 --> 00:10:01,270
Vanessa: Yeah, when I think of this expression,
I do think of water that you're in the swimming

224
00:10:01,270 --> 00:10:06,600
pool or in the ocean and the water's getting
higher and higher and when the water is over

225
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,030
your head, bad news.

226
00:10:08,030 --> 00:10:11,310
Dan: Yeah, I mean really, that probably means
you're going to die.

227
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:12,310
Vanessa: Yeah.

228
00:10:12,310 --> 00:10:16,450
Dan: This is a little bit of an expression
that's not literal, obvious.

229
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:17,910
That's why it's idiom right?

230
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:19,290
You're just in trouble.

231
00:10:19,290 --> 00:10:20,290
You're in big trouble.

232
00:10:20,290 --> 00:10:21,290
Vanessa: Yes.

233
00:10:21,290 --> 00:10:22,290
In over your head.

234
00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:26,710
I want to know for you, when was a situation
that was just too much for you and you felt

235
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:28,830
like you were in over your head.

236
00:10:28,830 --> 00:10:30,220
What was a time?

237
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:39,290
Maybe you decided to volunteer at your job
to be the person who helps the American director

238
00:10:39,290 --> 00:10:43,350
who's coming to your office and you said,
sure, I'll talk to the American director.

239
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:46,500
I'll take him out to dinner, I'll guide him
around the office.

240
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:47,500
I can speak English.

241
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:53,610
This is fine, and then you meet him and you
realize he has a strong Southern accent.

242
00:10:53,610 --> 00:10:55,470
Dan: Howdy, folks.

243
00:10:55,470 --> 00:11:02,470
Vanessa: Maybe at the end of that day, you
feel like I was in over my head.

244
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:05,580
This situation was too much for me.

245
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:10,080
I can understand English, but I didn't realize
that his accent would be so strong.

246
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:12,100
I was in over my head.

247
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:14,310
Dan: Yeah, I have a personal example.

248
00:11:14,310 --> 00:11:15,310
Vanessa: Yes.

249
00:11:15,310 --> 00:11:16,310
What was your personal example?

250
00:11:16,310 --> 00:11:21,270
Dan: We used to teach English in South Korea,
you probably know this.

251
00:11:21,270 --> 00:11:28,610
I had never taught children before so the
first time I had to teach a class of children,

252
00:11:28,610 --> 00:11:30,710
I was in over my head.

253
00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:36,030
In over my head because the children, they
didn't necessarily respect me yet.

254
00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:39,860
I'm different looking in South Korea, my red
hair and my freckles.

255
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:42,450
They thought it was weird.

256
00:11:42,450 --> 00:11:46,700
They didn't take me seriously, they started
yelling and screaming.

257
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:49,820
I was in over my head because I didn't know
what to do about it so.

258
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:54,740
Vanessa: Yes, and over time, you learned more
and more what to do but that's a perfect situation

259
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:59,510
and perfect expression to use especially for
your first day at school, your first day as

260
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:04,970
a teacher, your first day at your job, maybe
your first day living in the U.S. or if you

261
00:12:04,970 --> 00:12:05,970
move to Australia.

262
00:12:05,970 --> 00:12:06,970
Dan: This happens a lot.

263
00:12:06,970 --> 00:12:10,970
Vanessa: I was in over my head that first
day, but eventually it got better so I want

264
00:12:10,970 --> 00:12:14,400
to know for you, when was a situation when
you were in over your head?

265
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,090
Dan: Tell us about it.

266
00:12:16,090 --> 00:12:17,110
Vanessa: Yes, yes.

267
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:18,510
Let us know in the comments.

268
00:12:18,510 --> 00:12:21,990
Make sure that you use this expression as
much as you can.

269
00:12:21,990 --> 00:12:26,240
I'd like to read a sentence that one of you
wrote, I was in over my head.

270
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,900
I was stressed.

271
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:28,940
I couldn't do it.

272
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:33,150
Oh, stress is usually associated with being
in over your head.

273
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:34,150
You're stressed.

274
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:35,150
You're overwhelmed.

275
00:12:35,150 --> 00:12:36,330
Yes, it's just too much.

276
00:12:36,330 --> 00:12:37,760
I'm in over my head.

277
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:39,990
Khaled says, I'm in over my head.

278
00:12:39,990 --> 00:12:41,920
The American director speaks too fast.

279
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:43,430
Dan: That's a good example.

280
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:47,210
Vanessa: I hope that that didn't happen to
you but if this happened, you're going to

281
00:12:47,210 --> 00:12:50,220
use a beautiful idiom to describe it, oh,
I'm in over my head.

282
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:54,270
Dan: Are you in over your head when you watch
Vanessa's videos?

283
00:12:54,270 --> 00:12:55,270
I hope not.

284
00:12:55,270 --> 00:12:56,270
Vanessa: Oh, yes.

285
00:12:56,270 --> 00:13:00,400
I hope that you can easily understand and
you're not too cool for my videos.

286
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:02,090
Dan: She's a little advanced.

287
00:13:02,090 --> 00:13:03,870
Vanessa: Sure, if you're here.

288
00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:07,460
That means you can already understand two
native English speakers.

289
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:12,670
Congratulations, but hopefully it means that
you're learning something new while also understanding

290
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:14,660
most of our explanations.

291
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:16,280
I just used our third expression.

292
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:17,280
Dan: You did?

293
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:18,320
Vanessa: The slang expression.

294
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,700
I hope you're not too cool for these videos.

295
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:22,360
Dan: Too cool for.

296
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:23,360
Vanessa: Yes.

297
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:29,020
I want to know when you were a teenager, what
was something that you decided that you didn't

298
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:30,020
want to do anymore?

299
00:13:30,020 --> 00:13:32,870
Dan: Yeah, I can actually go back to when
I was younger.

300
00:13:32,870 --> 00:13:33,870
Vanessa: Okay.

301
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:40,180
Dan: Even when I was a kid, when I was eight
years old, I was too cool for Barney.

302
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:42,200
You know Barney is?

303
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:44,820
Vanessa: Barney is a kids TV show.

304
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:46,450
It's probably popular around the world.

305
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:47,530
It's a big purple dinosaur.

306
00:13:47,530 --> 00:13:54,220
Dan: He's a big purple dinosaur in a big costume
and he's, I'm happy, you know and I remember

307
00:13:54,220 --> 00:14:00,160
being as a kid, I was too cool for Barney
and this means that I thought it was dumb.

308
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:02,200
I wouldn't watch it myself.

309
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:06,940
If somebody was watching this show, I would
maybe look down on them.

310
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:08,780
Vanessa: They're too like, they're children.

311
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:09,780
Children, watch this.

312
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:11,670
I'm too old and too cool for this.

313
00:14:11,670 --> 00:14:13,470
Dan: I don't watch Barney.

314
00:14:13,470 --> 00:14:15,090
I'm too cool for Barney.

315
00:14:15,090 --> 00:14:16,090
Vanessa: Yes.

316
00:14:16,090 --> 00:14:18,460
I feel like this slang expression, too cool.

317
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:19,990
Dan: Barney, B-A-R-N-Y.

318
00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:21,000
Vanessa: N-E-Y?

319
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,020
Dan: Y?

320
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:23,020
E-Y?

321
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:24,020
Vanessa: E-Y?

322
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:25,020
Something like that.

323
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:26,550
I'm sure you'll find the big purple dinosaur
online.

324
00:14:26,550 --> 00:14:27,550
Dan: That's it.

325
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:31,760
Vanessa: Well, when you say too cool for something,
it's pretty self explanatory.

326
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:35,640
You feel like, this is for children.

327
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:40,310
This is for someone who is less than me so
it's a slang expression where you feel like

328
00:14:40,310 --> 00:14:46,530
you're above some kind of item or activity
or concept.

329
00:14:46,530 --> 00:14:48,620
Oftentimes, teenagers feel like this.

330
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:56,590
Maybe when you were a teenager, you felt like
you were too cool to hold hands with your

331
00:14:56,590 --> 00:14:59,620
mom when you cross to the street.

332
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:01,270
You said, I'm a teenager.

333
00:15:01,270 --> 00:15:02,270
I can handle this.

334
00:15:02,270 --> 00:15:06,670
I'm too cool for that and you kind of feel
like that's for children.

335
00:15:06,670 --> 00:15:09,780
Dan: Yes, and this slang term definitely implies
attitude.

336
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:13,320
You're not just saying, oh no, I don't like
that.

337
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:15,000
You're saying, that's stupid.

338
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,320
Vanessa: Yeah, I'm too cool for that.

339
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:18,470
Dan: That's dumb.

340
00:15:18,470 --> 00:15:21,450
I wouldn't listen to that music anymore, loser.

341
00:15:21,450 --> 00:15:26,710
Vanessa: Yeah, so you might hear this often
used by kids, like in Dan's example about

342
00:15:26,710 --> 00:15:33,160
the children's TV show or by teenagers but
we can use this as adults in a joking way

343
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:39,770
because we often take expressions that are
strong and then use them in lighter situations

344
00:15:39,770 --> 00:15:42,210
where it's not as serious.

345
00:15:42,210 --> 00:15:49,190
For example, maybe if I want to watch, I don't
know if you've seen the, I think it's a Pixar

346
00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:51,420
movie, Coco.

347
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:54,550
It's really cute and I enjoyed it a lot.

348
00:15:54,550 --> 00:15:59,270
If I asked Dan, hey, do you want to watch
Coco tonight?

349
00:15:59,270 --> 00:16:00,270
He might say.

350
00:16:00,270 --> 00:16:01,270
Dan: I would say.

351
00:16:01,270 --> 00:16:02,270
Vanessa: He would say yes.

352
00:16:02,270 --> 00:16:04,000
Let's imagine that he might say no and let's
say-

353
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Dan: Let's say I'm too cool.

354
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,600
Vanessa: Yeah, I might say, what?

355
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:07,600
Dan: Coco.

356
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:08,650
Vanessa: Are you too cool to watch Coco?

357
00:16:08,650 --> 00:16:10,330
Dan: I don't watch cartoons.

358
00:16:10,330 --> 00:16:14,200
Vanessa: That's not true but in this situation.

359
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:15,380
Dan: I actually love cartoons.

360
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:20,540
Vanessa: We might say, I might say to Dan,
are you too cool for Coco?

361
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:22,010
Dan: Too cool for Coco.

362
00:16:22,010 --> 00:16:25,100
Vanessa: Are you too cool for Pixar movies?

363
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:27,980
Are you to cool for more animated movies?

364
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:35,790
Here, we're using this not in a, like a teenager
or childish way, but just in a joke kind of

365
00:16:35,790 --> 00:16:36,790
way.

366
00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:37,790
Dan: It's kind of a joke.

367
00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:40,530
Vanessa: Yeah, to say oh, you think you're
better than this movie?

368
00:16:40,530 --> 00:16:41,620
It's great for everybody.

369
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:42,620
I enjoy it.

370
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:47,030
I think a lot of people have enjoyed it so
you can use too cool for something in a lot

371
00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:48,030
of situations.

372
00:16:48,030 --> 00:16:54,810
Dan: By the way, the original expression I
think from too cool is too cool for school.

373
00:16:54,810 --> 00:16:56,930
We actually say that still.

374
00:16:56,930 --> 00:17:02,970
Sometimes people even say that like as a good
thing, like, wow, that's too cool for school.

375
00:17:02,970 --> 00:17:04,310
Vanessa: When would you use that?

376
00:17:04,310 --> 00:17:08,240
This is taking slang to the next level, extra
slang.

377
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:13,270
Dan: If you saw maybe like an outfit that
was really cool.

378
00:17:13,270 --> 00:17:18,329
You'd say, that's too cool, or that's too
cool for school.

379
00:17:18,329 --> 00:17:23,309
I wouldn't say this is extremely common but
it's, people would understand you're not being

380
00:17:23,309 --> 00:17:24,309
rude.

381
00:17:24,309 --> 00:17:27,730
Vanessa: Yeah, so I imagine if you heard this
in a TV show or a movie, now you'll feel a

382
00:17:27,730 --> 00:17:32,460
little more comfortable with too cool and
also too cool for school, which is just the

383
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:34,190
rhyming original expression.

384
00:17:34,190 --> 00:17:39,529
Dan: Yeah, the original expression was, you
would say somebody is too cool for school.

385
00:17:39,529 --> 00:17:41,259
He's too cool for school.

386
00:17:41,259 --> 00:17:43,190
He doesn't like to go to school.

387
00:17:43,190 --> 00:17:45,169
He is unhappy at school.

388
00:17:45,169 --> 00:17:46,330
Vanessa: He has an attitude.

389
00:17:46,330 --> 00:17:48,429
Dan: He doesn't like reading, that kind of
thing.

390
00:17:48,429 --> 00:17:49,720
That's the original source.

391
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:50,720
Vanessa: Yeah.

392
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:53,710
Well, we have a lot of great sentences here
from those of you who are joining us live,

393
00:17:53,710 --> 00:17:56,320
talking about-
Dan: Your grandma's too cool to watch Coco.

394
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,309
Vanessa: Oh, no.

395
00:17:58,309 --> 00:18:03,380
Well, Sylvester says I will never be too cool
to watch cartoons.

396
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:04,380
Dan: I agree.

397
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:06,960
Vanessa: I'll never be too cool for cartoons.

398
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:10,139
Dan: Maybe it's because I was a child with
cartoons.

399
00:18:10,139 --> 00:18:13,740
I still like cartoons especially Miyazaki,
does anybody watching Miyazaki, Japanese animation.

400
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:14,740
Vanessa: Very cool.

401
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:15,740
Dan: I like that.

402
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:21,350
Vanessa: Very cool or another great comment
we've got here is, I'm too cool for dancing.

403
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:27,370
Oh, so maybe if your friend asked you to go
to a concert to dance or a club or somewhere

404
00:18:27,370 --> 00:18:28,960
to dance on, I'm too cool for dancing.

405
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:32,749
Dan: I'm not too cool for dancing but I'm
bad at dancing so.

406
00:18:32,749 --> 00:18:36,999
Vanessa: There are lots of excuses you can
give, various excuses.

407
00:18:36,999 --> 00:18:38,799
Dan: Too cool for Brad Pitt?

408
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:43,580
Vanessa: Oh, maybe there's a lot of different
ways that you can use too cool for something.

409
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:48,490
Well, I'd like to thank you so much for joining
us to learn about phrasal verbs, idioms and

410
00:18:48,490 --> 00:18:50,840
the slang expression today.

411
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:54,940
Figure out, in over my head and too cool for
something.

412
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:59,950
If you enjoyed Dan and I's explanation and
our little stories about this, we do this

413
00:18:59,950 --> 00:19:02,490
every month in The Fearless Fluency Club.

414
00:19:02,490 --> 00:19:06,399
We make a vocabulary lesson that's about,
how long would you say?

415
00:19:06,399 --> 00:19:08,350
Dan: That's like 30, 40 minutes.

416
00:19:08,350 --> 00:19:10,549
Vanessa: Oh, I'd say it's about an hour.

417
00:19:10,549 --> 00:19:12,409
Usually there's two parts.

418
00:19:12,409 --> 00:19:16,159
There's two 30 minute parts that we have for
the vocabulary lessons.

419
00:19:16,159 --> 00:19:17,159
Dan: Okay, that's true.

420
00:19:17,159 --> 00:19:18,159
We cut it in half.

421
00:19:18,159 --> 00:19:21,860
Vanessa: Yeah, we cut it in half and make
two different parts so you'll get an hour

422
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:27,470
of about 15 to 20 vocabulary expressions every
month.

423
00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:32,130
For the month of December, you got a sneak
preview about these expressions.

424
00:19:32,130 --> 00:19:40,659
In December, three of the 17 or 18 expressions
are figure out something, in over my head

425
00:19:40,659 --> 00:19:42,389
and too cool for something.

426
00:19:42,389 --> 00:19:43,389
Dan: Too cool.

427
00:19:43,389 --> 00:19:47,059
Vanessa: These are three expressions that
we talk about in the December lesson set for

428
00:19:47,059 --> 00:19:51,559
The Fearless Fluency Club so I'd like to show
you really quick and give you a quick sneak

429
00:19:51,559 --> 00:19:52,559
preview.

430
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:53,570
Dan: Yes, so Let's take a look.

431
00:19:53,570 --> 00:19:59,929
Vanessa: Yes, of this wonderful monthly lesson
set so that you can see here.

432
00:19:59,929 --> 00:20:07,100
We have the December 2018 lesson set that's
going to come out tomorrow.

433
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:13,679
If you join in December, you'll get access
to the December lesson set and you can use

434
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:21,029
the coupon code NEW, N-E-W to get it for only
$5 and I'd like to show you here, we have

435
00:20:21,029 --> 00:20:24,289
the vocabulary that we just mentioned.

436
00:20:24,289 --> 00:20:27,981
The vocabulary part one, you can see, oh we're
going to put this on.

437
00:20:27,981 --> 00:20:28,981
Dan: I had a haircut.

438
00:20:28,981 --> 00:20:32,379
Vanessa: On mute, just so that you can see
it.

439
00:20:32,379 --> 00:20:38,690
We talk about a lot of different expressions
and then you can see the clips from the original

440
00:20:38,690 --> 00:20:44,690
conversation when it was used so here, you're
getting great explanations from Dan and I.

441
00:20:44,690 --> 00:20:49,690
Two different parts and then we go on to the
grammar lesson and in December, you're going

442
00:20:49,690 --> 00:20:54,860
to get one of the longest grammar lessons
that I've ever made.

443
00:20:54,860 --> 00:21:00,090
It's 34 minutes but you're going to get access
to this grammar lesson where we're going to

444
00:21:00,090 --> 00:21:05,700
discuss some excellent expressions with would
have.

445
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:09,019
Would have, oh, this is a complex verb.

446
00:21:09,019 --> 00:21:14,159
It seems simple but it's quite complex so
we break it down, go through it step by step

447
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:17,110
and I try to help you use it naturally.

448
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:21,179
Then in the next section in December, we talk
about pronunciation.

449
00:21:21,179 --> 00:21:28,190
This pronunciation lesson is extra special
because we're going to be focusing on a lot

450
00:21:28,190 --> 00:21:29,190
of sentences.

451
00:21:29,190 --> 00:21:31,830
Oh, here we have a sentence with figure out,
they can figure things out.

452
00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:39,149
We go through this step by step and you can
figure out how to pronounce this sentence

453
00:21:39,149 --> 00:21:44,830
as accurately as possible and then you get
to watch the conversation with my friend,

454
00:21:44,830 --> 00:21:45,830
Faith.

455
00:21:45,830 --> 00:21:51,700
You get to hear her naturally say this originally
in the conversation because the last video

456
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:59,450
is the conversation where we have a 30 minute
chat together about her interesting job, working

457
00:21:59,450 --> 00:22:03,450
for AmeriCorps, which is a nonprofit in the
U.S.

458
00:22:03,450 --> 00:22:09,960
She volunteers at different schools, at different
organizations and has interesting perspective

459
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:11,880
about education.

460
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:15,539
We're going to talk about some wonderful ideas
there.

461
00:22:15,539 --> 00:22:21,899
We also focus on a story that includes all
of the vocabulary and grammar.

462
00:22:21,899 --> 00:22:24,919
All of the would have expressions.

463
00:22:24,919 --> 00:22:27,759
Some new expressions as well that are in the
story.

464
00:22:27,759 --> 00:22:32,600
This is a fun Christmas story because it's
the December lesson set and you can study

465
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:34,119
this all together.

466
00:22:34,119 --> 00:22:42,249
I hope that this lesson set overall will help
you to feel comfortable using English and

467
00:22:42,249 --> 00:22:48,990
really trying to incorporate it into your
daily life so if you enjoyed today's lesson,

468
00:22:48,990 --> 00:22:51,960
feel free to join us every month in The Fearless
Fluency Club.

469
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:53,830
There is a link in the description.

470
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:58,049
You can continue learning with Dan and I.
Dan: You can figure out English with us.

471
00:22:58,049 --> 00:22:59,882
Vanessa: Yes, you can figure out how to use
it.

472
00:22:59,882 --> 00:23:01,870
Dan: If you're not too cool for school.

473
00:23:01,870 --> 00:23:03,879
Vanessa: Yeah, don't be too cool for school.

474
00:23:03,879 --> 00:23:09,990
Before we go today, I'd like to practice pronouncing
a final sentence that uses two of the expressions

475
00:23:09,990 --> 00:23:11,220
we talked about today.

476
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:14,390
I wrote it down here so that we can practice
it together.

477
00:23:14,390 --> 00:23:19,460
It is, I would like to say it slowly, and
then we're going to speed it up and I want

478
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:22,369
you to say it out loud so that you can use
your speaking muscles.

479
00:23:22,369 --> 00:23:24,390
I'd like you to join me too, Dan.

480
00:23:24,390 --> 00:23:25,390
Dan: Okay.

481
00:23:25,390 --> 00:23:26,390
Vanessa: Okay.

482
00:23:26,390 --> 00:23:27,390
Dan: I'm nervous.

483
00:23:27,390 --> 00:23:28,390
Vanessa: All right, we got this.

484
00:23:28,390 --> 00:23:34,470
The sentence is, I was in over my head before.

485
00:23:34,470 --> 00:23:35,870
Dan: In over my head.

486
00:23:35,870 --> 00:23:40,409
Vanessa: Now I figured out how to learn English.

487
00:23:40,409 --> 00:23:46,450
I was in over my head before, but now I figured
out how to learn English.

488
00:23:46,450 --> 00:23:48,480
What does the sentence mean?

489
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:52,770
I was in over my head before, but now I figured
out how to learn English.

490
00:23:52,770 --> 00:23:58,309
Dan: Well, this means that before today maybe,
you didn't know how to speak English at all.

491
00:23:58,309 --> 00:23:59,950
You didn't understand me.

492
00:23:59,950 --> 00:24:03,669
You didn't understand Vanessa, but now you
have figured it out.

493
00:24:03,669 --> 00:24:09,290
Vanessa: Yes, you have figured out the best
path and the best method is with Vanessa and

494
00:24:09,290 --> 00:24:10,290
Dan.

495
00:24:10,290 --> 00:24:11,290
Dan: This is true.

496
00:24:11,290 --> 00:24:15,100
Vanessa: Let's speed this sentence up and
I want you to pronounce it clearly and then

497
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:16,100
use it yourself.

498
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:17,100
Are you ready?

499
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:23,659
I was in over my head before, but now I figured
out how to learn English.

500
00:24:23,659 --> 00:24:24,919
Let's say it faster.

501
00:24:24,919 --> 00:24:30,279
I was in over my head before, but now I've
figured out how to learn English.

502
00:24:30,279 --> 00:24:31,279
I wasn't over my head before, but now I figured
out how to learn English.

503
00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:32,279
Can you say it?

504
00:24:32,279 --> 00:24:34,230
Dan: I was in over my head before, but now
I have figured out how to learn English.

505
00:24:34,230 --> 00:24:40,309
Vanessa: I was in over my head before, but
now I have figured out how to learn English,

506
