581
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:26,000  
somebody might just say do it again so
it is a little redundant but right you

582
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:26,010  
it is a little redundant but right you
 

583
00:13:26,010 --> 00:13:28,520  
it is a little redundant but right you
know it's not a big deal right but a lot

584
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:28,530  
know it's not a big deal right but a lot
 

585
00:13:28,530 --> 00:13:30,710  
know it's not a big deal right but a lot
of people would say that's still but if

586
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:30,720  
of people would say that's still but if
 

587
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:33,230  
of people would say that's still but if
you really wanted to emphasize then the

588
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:33,240  
you really wanted to emphasize then the
 

589
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:35,570  
you really wanted to emphasize then the
first time you messed up really bad then

590
00:13:35,570 --> 00:13:35,580  
first time you messed up really bad then
 

591
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:38,180  
first time you messed up really bad then
that would be you would say do it over

592
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:38,190  
that would be you would say do it over
 

593
00:13:38,190 --> 00:13:40,850  
that would be you would say do it over
so if you messed up really bad and maybe

594
00:13:40,850 --> 00:13:40,860  
so if you messed up really bad and maybe
 

595
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:43,040  
so if you messed up really bad and maybe
you did it twice then you'd say I have

596
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:43,050  
you did it twice then you'd say I have
 

597
00:13:43,050 --> 00:13:45,260  
you did it twice then you'd say I have

to do it over again yeah they did it
three times right so it couldn't be a

600
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:47,130  
three times right so it couldn't be a
 

601
00:13:47,130 --> 00:13:48,770  
three times right so it couldn't be a
more emphasis so that's a great question

602
00:13:48,770 --> 00:13:48,780  
more emphasis so that's a great question
 

603
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:51,200
