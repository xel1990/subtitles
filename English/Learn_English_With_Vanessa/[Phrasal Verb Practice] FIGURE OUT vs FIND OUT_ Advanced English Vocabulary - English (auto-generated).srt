hopefully she can continue to figure it

412
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:44,850  
hopefully she can continue to figure it
 

413
00:11:44,850 --> 00:11:45,710  
hopefully she can continue to figure it
out herself

414
00:11:45,710 --> 00:11:45,720  
out herself
 

415

by using that kind of mental process

416
00:11:48,259 --> 00:11:48,269  
by using that kind of mental process
 

417
00:11:48,269 --> 00:11:52,939  
by using that kind of mental process
it's a process so let's go to the second

418
00:11:52,939 --> 00:11:52,949  
it's a process so let's go to the second
 

419
00:11:52,949 --> 00:11:55,670  
it's a process so let's go to the second
phrasal verb and we'll compare these two

420
00:11:55,670 --> 00:11:55,680  
phrasal verb and we'll compare these two
 

421
00:11:55,680 --> 00:12:00,590  
phrasal verb and we'll compare these two
together the second one is find out find

422
00:12:00,590 --> 00:12:00,600  
together the second one is find out find
 

423
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:04,309  
together the second one is find out find
out hmm what do you think is the

424
00:12:04,309 --> 00:12:04,319  
out hmm what do you think is the
 

425
00:12:04,319 --> 00:12:07,910  
out hmm what do you think is the
difference between figure out and find

426
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:07,920  
difference between figure out and find
 

427
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:13,519  
difference between figure out and find
out how can we use find out so far we

428
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:13,529  
out how can we use find out so far we
 

429
00:12:13,529 --> 00:12:17,660  
out how can we use find out so far we
had three words figure out how but what

430
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:17,670  
had three words figure out how but what
 

431
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:21,710  
had three words figure out how but what
could we use with find out there's one

432
00:12:21,710 --> 00:12:21,720  
could we use with find out there's one
 

433
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:26,269  
could we use with find out there's one
word similar word we don't have to use

434
00:12:26,269 --> 00:12:26,279  
word similar word we don't have to use
 

435
00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:30,769  
word similar word we don't have to use
it but we can use it if we want to be

436
00:12:30,769 --> 00:12:30,779  
it but we can use it if we want to be
 

437
00:12:30,779 --> 00:12:33,319  
it but we can use it if we want to be
extra clear about using the phrasal verb

438
00:12:33,319 --> 00:12:33,329  
extra clear about using the phrasal verb
 

439
00:12:33,329 --> 00:12:37,340

to solve the problem let's write a
 

477
00:13:41,490 --> 00:13:44,570  
to solve the problem let's write a
similar sentence but using find out I'm

478
00:13:44,570 --> 00:13:44,580  
similar sentence but using find out I'm
 

479
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:58,360  
similar sentence but using find out I'm
going to find out what the solution is

480
00:13:58,360 --> 00:13:58,370

483
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:11,300  
Oh lovely said it's I need to find out I
need to find out what the solution is so

484
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:11,310  
need to find out what the solution is so
 

485
00:14:11,310 --> 00:14:15,890  
need to find out what the solution is so
here we have a specific a specific thing

486

here we have a specific a specific thing
maybe the solution is a physical thing

488
00:14:18,110 --> 00:14:18,120  
maybe the solution is a physical thing
 

489
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:20,540  
maybe the solution is a physical thing
maybe it's a mental thing but we have

490
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:20,550  
maybe it's a mental thing but we have
 

491
00:14:20,550 --> 00:14:25,400  
maybe it's a mental thing but we have
one item here the solution I need to

492
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:25,410  
one item here the solution I need to
 

493
00:14:25,410 --> 00:14:28,400  
one item here the solution I need to
find out what the solution is I need to
