843
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:43,510  
floors we don't have any carpet in our
house and that's mainly because it's an

844
00:16:43,510 --> 00:16:43,520  
house and that's mainly because it's an
 

845
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:45,880  
house and that's mainly because it's an
older apartment so it has wood but also

846
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:45,890  
older apartment so it has wood but also
 

847
00:16:45,890 --> 00:16:48,010  
older apartment so it has wood but also
because we have two cats and a baby so

848
00:16:48,010 --> 00:16:48,020  
because we have two cats and a baby so
 

849
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:49,690  
because we have two cats and a baby so
it's a little bit difficult to clean

850
00:16:49,690 --> 00:16:49,700  
it's a little bit difficult to clean
 

851
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:51,970  
it's a little bit difficult to clean
carpet but most American houses will

carpet but most American houses will
 

853
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:55,900  
carpet but most American houses will
have carpets usually in the bedrooms or

854
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:55,910  
have carpets usually in the bedrooms or
 

855
00:16:55,910 --> 00:16:57,850  
have carpets usually in the bedrooms or
if they have an upstairs area in the

in the main room or in the living room I
 

861
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,880  
in the main room or in the living room I
think it's kind of becoming a more

862
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:03,890  
think it's kind of becoming a more
 

863
00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:06,520  
think it's kind of becoming a more
