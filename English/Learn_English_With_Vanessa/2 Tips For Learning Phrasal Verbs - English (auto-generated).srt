recommend is learning phrasal verbs with

56
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:11,510  
recommend is learning phrasal verbs with
 

57
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:15,550  
recommend is learning phrasal verbs with
the same verb but different prepositions

58
00:01:15,550 --> 00:01:15,560  
the same verb but different prepositions
 

59
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:20,600  
the same verb but different prepositions
for example if you learned go out go up

60
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:20,610  
for example if you learned go out go up
 

61
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:24,109  
for example if you learned go out go up
to go around it's very difficult to

62
00:01:24,109 --> 00:01:24,119  
to go around it's very difficult to
 

63
00:01:24,119 --> 00:01:26,300  
to go around it's very difficult to
remember the different participles the

64
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:26,310  
remember the different participles the
 

65
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:28,580  
remember the different participles the
different prepositions at the end so I

66
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:28,590  
different prepositions at the end so I
 

67
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:31,880  
different prepositions at the end so I
recommend instead the opposite my first

68
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:31,890  
recommend instead the opposite my first
 

69
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:35,890  
recommend instead the opposite my first
recommendation is to have the same

70
00:01:35,890 --> 00:01:35,900  
recommendation is to have the same
 

71
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:39,649  
recommendation is to have the same
participle but a different verb so for

72
00:01:39,649 --> 00:01:39,659  
participle but a different verb so for
 

73
00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:41,870  
participle but a different verb so for
