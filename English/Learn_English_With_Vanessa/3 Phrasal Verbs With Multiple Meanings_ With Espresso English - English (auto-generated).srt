97
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:10,550  
and maybe a different way I think you've
got a really cool method for that yeah

the first thing back up well the first
thing that came to mind was a computer

208
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:25,890  
thing that came to mind was a computer
 

209
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:27,410  
thing that came to mind was a computer
because I'm looking at my computer right

210
00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:27,420  
because I'm looking at my computer right
 

211

we need to back up pictures or something
 

215
00:04:34,170 --> 00:04:36,590  
we need to back up pictures or something
on your hard drive exactly to make a

216
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:36,600  
on your hard drive exactly to make a
 

217
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:39,500  
on your hard drive exactly to make a
digital copy like an extra copy just in

218
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:39,510  
digital copy like an extra copy just in
 

219
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:41,810  
digital copy like an extra copy just in

00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:41,820  
case your computer breaks or you lose it
 

221
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:44,240  
case your computer breaks or you lose it
and then you have your backup so you can

222
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:44,250  
and then you have your backup so you can
 

223
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:47,390  
and then you have your backup so you can
have a copy of all your files and I do

224
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:47,400  
have a copy of all your files and I do
 

225
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:49,790  
have a copy of all your files and I do
that all the time so I don't know if you

226
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:49,800  
that all the time so I don't know if you
 

227
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:52,310  
that all the time so I don't know if you
do - I should probably do it more I've

228
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:52,320  
do - I should probably do it more I've
 

229
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,290  
do - I should probably do it more I've
got an older computer over here that I

230
00:04:54,290 --> 00:04:54,300  
got an older computer over here that I
 

231
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:57,320  
got an older computer over here that I
need to backup everything on that

232
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:57,330  
need to backup everything on that
 

233
00:04:57,330 --> 00:04:59,000  
need to backup everything on that
computer because who knows what's gonna

234
00:04:59,000 --> 00:04:59,010  
computer because who knows what's gonna
 

235
00:04:59,010 --> 00:05:00,590  
computer because who knows what's gonna
happen to it but yeah that's a really

236
00:05:00,590 --> 00:05:00,600  
happen to it but yeah that's a really
 

237
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:03,920  
happen to it but yeah that's a really
valuable thing to do - so another one

238
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:03,930  
valuable thing to do - so another one
 

239
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:05,720  
valuable thing to do - so another one
for backup is when you're driving a car

240
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:05,730  
for backup is when you're driving a car
 

241
00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:08,750  
for backup is when you're driving a car
and you put the car in reverse and you

242
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:08,760  
and you put the car in reverse and you
 

243
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:10,880  
and you put the car in reverse and you
go backwards we also call that backing

244
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:10,890  
go backwards we also call that backing
 

245
00:05:10,890 --> 00:05:14,360  
go backwards we also call that backing
up the car right so you need to be very

246
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:14,370  
up the car right so you need to be very
 

247
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:16,700  
up the car right so you need to be very
careful check your mirrors when you're

248
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:16,710  
careful check your mirrors when you're
 

249
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:19,610  
careful check your mirrors when you're
backing up some new drivers might hit

250
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:19,620  
backing up some new drivers might hit
 

251
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:21,500  
backing up some new drivers might hit
something accidentally behind the car

252
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:21,510  
something accidentally behind the car
 

253
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:24,830  
something accidentally behind the car
when backing up so that meaning of

254
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:24,840  
when backing up so that meaning of
 

255
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:26,780  
when backing up so that meaning of
backup means the movement actually

256
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:26,790  
backup means the movement actually
 

257
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:28,640  
backup means the movement actually
moving backwards usually with the car

258
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:28,650  
moving backwards usually with the car
 

259
00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:30,230  
moving backwards usually with the car
yeah it's a little more straightforward

260
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:30,240  
yeah it's a little more straightforward
 

261
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,900  
yeah it's a little more straightforward
you're backing up the car it's literally

262
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:32,910  
you're backing up the car it's literally
 

263
00:05:32,910 --> 00:05:37,400  
you're backing up the car it's literally
going back yep now what does it mean if

00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:42,890  
your toilet is backed up oh that's
another great definition yeah I guess

268
00:05:42,890 --> 00:05:42,900  
another great definition yeah I guess
 

269
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:45,290  
another great definition yeah I guess
that would mean that it's stopped

270
00:05:45,290 --> 00:05:45,300  
that would mean that it's stopped
 

271
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:48,800  
that would mean that it's stopped

blocked like too much or something
accumulated and now the process can't

278
00:05:58,100 --> 00:05:58,110  
accumulated and now the process can't
 

279
00:05:58,110 --> 00:06:02,180  
accumulated and now the process can't
happen I know a lot of times when you go

oh we're receiving a lot of applications
 

285
00:06:06,930 --> 00:06:09,830  
oh we're receiving a lot of applications
and we're really backed up like there's

286
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:09,840  
and we're really backed up like there's
 

287
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,840  
and we're really backed up like there's
just too much coming in and we can't

just too much coming in and we can't
 

289
00:06:11,850 --> 00:06:13,580  
just too much coming in and we can't
process these applications so that's

290
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:13,590  
process these applications so that's
 

291
00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:15,800  
process these applications so that's
another meaning of backup which means to

to back someone like to support

314
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:46,130  
to back someone like to support

to back someone like to support
something if we say you have an argument

316
00:06:48,999 --> 00:06:49,009  
something if we say you have an argument
 

317
00:06:49,009 --> 00:06:51,730  
something if we say you have an argument
and you say some a crazy statement

318
00:06:51,730 --> 00:06:51,740  
and you say some a crazy statement
 

319
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:54,249  
and you say some a crazy statement
someone else might say do you have any

320
00:06:54,249 --> 00:06:54,259  
someone else might say do you have any
 

321
00:06:54,259 --> 00:06:56,800  
someone else might say do you have any
facts to back that up or can you back

322
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:56,810  
facts to back that up or can you back
 

323
00:06:56,810 --> 00:07:01,230  
facts to back that up or can you back
that up do you have any evidence exactly

324
00:07:01,230 --> 00:07:01,240  
that up do you have any evidence exactly
 

325
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:03,640  
that up do you have any evidence exactly
think about that but we totally use that

326
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:03,650  
think about that but we totally use that
 

327
00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:06,820  
think about that but we totally use that
all the time yes yeah so to sum it up I

328
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:06,830  
all the time yes yeah so to sum it up I
 

329
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:08,710  
all the time yes yeah so to sum it up I
guess would be to like for someone to

330
00:07:08,710 --> 00:07:08,720  
guess would be to like for someone to
 

331
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:12,820  
guess would be to like for someone to
support someone's position right in an

332
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:12,830  
support someone's position right in an
 

333
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:15,040  
support someone's position right in an
argument or debate so that's four

334
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:15,050  
argument or debate so that's four
 

335
00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:16,810  
argument or debate so that's four

different meanings for the phrasal verb
 

337
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:18,129  
different meanings for the phrasal verb
back up and you can see it they're all

338
00:07:18,129 --> 00:07:18,139  
back up and you can see it they're all
 

339
00:07:18,139 --> 00:07:20,589  
back up and you can see it they're all
totally different yeah backing up your

340
00:07:20,589 --> 00:07:20,599  
totally different yeah backing up your
 

341
00:07:20,599 --> 00:07:24,550  
totally different yeah backing up your
computer a car your arguments the toilet

342

well that's right and that's the kind of

344
00:07:28,570 --> 00:07:28,580  
well that's right and that's the kind of
 

345
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:31,029  
well that's right and that's the kind of
thing that it's helpful to be aware of

346
00:07:31,029 --> 00:07:31,039  
thing that it's helpful to be aware of

446
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:29,950  
so that's kind of like a slang a little
 

447
00:09:29,950 --> 00:09:31,860  
so that's kind of like a slang a little
bit of an informal way to use take off

00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:33,910  
yeah I feel like that's a really
 

451
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:35,880  
yeah I feel like that's a really
comfortable expression that you'd use

452
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:35,890  
comfortable expression that you'd use
 

453
00:09:35,890 --> 00:09:38,250  
comfortable expression that you'd use
with people you know or people you're

454
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:38,260
