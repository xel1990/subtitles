the younger siblings get away with more
 

355
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:28,970  
the younger siblings get away with more
and just from my quick theory maybe it's

356
00:10:28,970 --> 00:10:28,980  
and just from my quick theory maybe it's
 

357
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:32,540  
and just from my quick theory maybe it's
because they have already experienced a

358
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:32,550  
because they have already experienced a
 

359
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:36,230  
because they have already experienced a
lot with the older sibling and they

360
00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:36,240  
lot with the older sibling and they
 

361
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,480  
lot with the older sibling and they
don't have the energy or they don't

362
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:38,490  
don't have the energy or they don't
 

363
00:10:38,490 --> 00:10:41,720  
don't have the energy or they don't
maybe want to be as strict with the

364
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:41,730  
maybe want to be as strict with the
 

365
00:10:41,730 --> 00:10:44,960  
maybe want to be as strict with the
youngest or they want the oldest to just

367
00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:48,200

be a good role model so if you're the

368
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:48,210  
be a good role model so if you're the
 

369
00:10:48,210 --> 00:10:50,329  
be a good role model so if you're the
oldest you might have experienced the
