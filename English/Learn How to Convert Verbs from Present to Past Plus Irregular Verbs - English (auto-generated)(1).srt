because each verb each irregular verb

158
00:05:00,939 --> 00:05:00,949  
because each verb each irregular verb
 

159
00:05:00,949 --> 00:05:03,649  
because each verb each irregular verb
converts differently when we try and

160
00:05:03,649 --> 00:05:03,659  
converts differently when we try and
 

161
00:05:03,659 --> 00:05:07,219  
converts differently when we try and
make it into a past tense verb so as an

162
00:05:07,219 --> 00:05:07,229  
make it into a past tense verb so as an
 

163
00:05:07,229 --> 00:05:09,830  
make it into a past tense verb so as an
example do you think he would say I

164
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:09,840  
example do you think he would say I
 

165
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:14,089  
example do you think he would say I
thinked about it yesterday I thought

166
00:05:14,089 --> 00:05:14,099  
thinked about it yesterday I thought
 

167
00:05:14,099 --> 00:05:18,550  
thinked about it yesterday I thought
about it okay so it changes entirely

168
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:18,560  
about it okay so it changes entirely
 

169
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:21,999  
about it okay so it changes entirely
like the spelling and how we say it

170
00:05:21,999 --> 00:05:22,009  
like the spelling and how we say it
 

171
00:05:22,009 --> 00:05:26,589  
like the spelling and how we say it
everything about it changes so we have

172
00:05:26,589 --> 00:05:26,599  
everything about it changes so we have
 

173
00:05:26,599 --> 00:05:33,230  
everything about it changes so we have
thought oh my god look at the difference

174
00:05:33,230 --> 00:05:33,240  
thought oh my god look at the difference
 

175
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:39,219  
thought oh my god look at the difference
like everything after this is gone and

176
00:05:39,219 --> 00:05:39,229  
like everything after this is gone and
 

177
00:05:39,229 --> 00:05:43,670  
like everything after this is gone and
we added new letters teacher what are

178
00:05:43,670 --> 00:05:43,680  
we added new letters teacher what are
 

179
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:44,970  
we added new letters teacher what are
you doing - uh sir

180
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:44,980  
you doing - uh sir
 

181

you doing - uh sir
using us but this is the truth you have

182
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:48,250  
using us but this is the truth you have
 

183
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:51,060  
using us but this is the truth you have
to practice all your irregular verbs to

184
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:51,070  
to practice all your irregular verbs to
 

185
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:55,230  
to practice all your irregular verbs to
get better right so we have in the past

186
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:55,240  
get better right so we have in the past
 

187
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:59,790  
get better right so we have in the past
tense right would be wrote I wrote a

188
00:05:59,790 --> 00:05:59,800  
tense right would be wrote I wrote a
 

189
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:10,740  
tense right would be wrote I wrote a
letter to my friend wrote okay so again

190
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:10,750  
letter to my friend wrote okay so again
 

191
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:14,100  
letter to my friend wrote okay so again
this is not a rule okay so be careful if

192
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:14,110  
this is not a rule okay so be careful if
 

193
00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:17,370  
this is not a rule okay so be careful if
you see another irregular verb that has

194
00:06:17,370 --> 00:06:17,380  
you see another irregular verb that has
 

195
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:21,510  
you see another irregular verb that has
something like ite at the end you don't

196
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:21,520  
something like ite at the end you don't
 

197
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:24,240  
something like ite at the end you don't
automatically convert it to OTE it's not

198
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:24,250  
automatically convert it to OTE it's not
 

199
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:27,300  
automatically convert it to OTE it's not
a rule this just applies to the verb

200
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:27,310  
a rule this just applies to the verb
 

201
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:30,510  
a rule this just applies to the verb
right because these are irregular verbs

202
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:30,520  
right because these are irregular verbs
 

203
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:34,530  
right because these are irregular verbs
be careful then we have read what do you

204
00:06:34,530 --> 00:06:34,540  
be careful then we have read what do you
 

205
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:37,650  
be careful then we have read what do you
think how do you think we change read in

206
00:06:37,650 --> 00:06:37,660  
think how do you think we change read in
 

207
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:43,140  
think how do you think we change read in
to past tense it becomes in to read but

208
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:43,150  
to past tense it becomes in to read but
 

209
00:06:43,150 --> 00:06:49,590  
to past tense it becomes in to read but
not read the color that's the color red

210
00:06:49,590 --> 00:06:49,600  
not read the color that's the color red
 

211
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:53,010  
not read the color that's the color red
okay that's not right but we say it that

212
00:06:53,010 --> 00:06:53,020  
okay that's not right but we say it that
 

213
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:58,170  
okay that's not right but we say it that
way it's actually the same exact

214
00:06:58,170 --> 00:06:58,180  
way it's actually the same exact
 

215
00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:03,840  
way it's actually the same exact
spelling as read so this is read now

216
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:03,850  
spelling as read so this is read now
 

217
00:07:03,850 --> 00:07:09,990  
spelling as read so this is read now
presently okay and this is read in the

218
00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:10,000  
presently okay and this is read in the
 

219
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,350  
presently okay and this is read in the
past so how do you know which one to use

220
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:13,360  
past so how do you know which one to use
 

221
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:16,350  
past so how do you know which one to use
it depends on the context if you're

all the same letters just in a different
 

261
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:36,430  
all the same letters just in a different
order so we have eight so EA T a te so

order so we have eight so EA T a te so
 

263

order so we have eight so EA T a te so
that makes it a bit more simple

that makes it a bit more simple
 

265
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:45,240  
that makes it a bit more simple
I hope and then they have speak spoke I

266
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:45,250  
 
 

267
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:48,720  
 
spoke to her about that thing that she

268
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:48,730

269
00:08:48,730 --> 00:08:53,320  
spoke to her about that thing that she
invited us to or whatever so see how

270
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:53,330  
invited us to or whatever so see how
 

271
00:08:53,330 --> 00:08:56,050  
invited us to or whatever so see how
with irregular verbs you don't really

272
00:08:56,050 --> 00:08:56,060  
with irregular verbs you don't really
 

273
00:08:56,060 --> 00:09:00,460  
with irregular verbs you don't really
have any rules each word is unique it's

274
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:00,470  
have any rules each word is unique it's
 

275
00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:05,050  
have any rules each word is unique it's
different and all you have to do is read

276
00:09:05,050 --> 00:09:05,060  
different and all you have to do is read
 

277
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:07,090  
different and all you have to do is read
read read right right right

00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:09,470  
practice practice practice because
 

281
00:09:09,470 --> 00:09:11,050  
practice practice practice because
they're a little bit more difficult to

282
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:11,060  
they're a little bit more difficult to
 

283
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:14,500  
they're a little bit more difficult to
to get a grasp of but regular verbs are

284
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:14,510  
to get a grasp of but regular verbs are
 

285
00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:17,410  
to get a grasp of but regular verbs are
really easy to understand so I don't

286
00:09:17,410 --> 00:09:17,420  
really easy to understand so I don't
 

287
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:19,360  
really easy to understand so I don't
want to hear any of you guys making any
