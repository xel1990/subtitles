1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,115
It feels like you two are hosting the show.

2
00:00:00,115 --> 00:00:03,843
Yewon, I hear your filmed radio show is amazing.
And there's much to see.

3
00:00:05,651 --> 00:00:07,355
You sing and dance on your show?

4
00:00:07,355 --> 00:00:10,594
Not too long ago... It was a big hit...
I danced to Sunmi's "Gashina."

5
00:00:14,739 --> 00:00:18,394
I sang songs from "La La Land" too.
Pretend this is your radio show.

6
00:00:20,923 --> 00:00:22,634
Show us your radio personality.

7
00:00:22,634 --> 00:00:25,112
Let's see Yewon the radio host.

8
00:00:25,987 --> 00:00:28,011
Just relax.

9
00:00:28,011 --> 00:00:29,980
I'm not sure about the dance moves.

10
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:31,995
Just do whatever comes to mind.

11
00:00:31,995 --> 00:00:36,242
This is Kim Yewon of 89.1 MHz KBS Cool FM.
I'll dance now.

12
00:00:38,797 --> 00:00:40,410
I thought it was the traffic report.

13
00:00:41,224 --> 00:00:44,196
(She changes as soon as the music starts)

14
00:00:45,001 --> 00:00:48,031
(We never expected dancing like this)

15
00:00:48,031 --> 00:00:49,287
She can do the moves!

16
00:00:49,287 --> 00:00:52,923
(She draws you in)

17
00:00:54,638 --> 00:00:56,979
(Hyejin did that dance too...)

18
00:00:56,979 --> 00:00:59,321
- She's good, isn't she? / - She is.

19
00:00:59,321 --> 00:01:00,422
(Yewon is a good dancer)

20
00:01:02,607 --> 00:01:04,596
(She'll get more fans today!)

21
00:01:05,575 --> 00:01:06,843
(Ta-da)

22
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:08,380
It's "Amor Fati."

23
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:10,079
(Fidgets)

24
00:01:10,979 --> 00:01:13,277
(Freestyle dancing)

25
00:01:13,277 --> 00:01:14,556
Kim Yewon!

26
00:01:14,556 --> 00:01:16,046
(I like this)

27
00:01:16,046 --> 00:01:20,629
Choi Sujong! Choi Sujong!

28
00:01:21,313 --> 00:01:24,069
(He's the king of silly freestyle dancing)

29
00:01:24,601 --> 00:01:26,902
(The king has returned)

30
00:01:27,801 --> 00:01:30,342
(This isn't enough excitement!)

31
00:01:31,130 --> 00:01:33,605
(I'll handle this!)

32
00:01:34,145 --> 00:01:36,070
(It's the king...)

33
00:01:36,402 --> 00:01:38,556
(I'll bring excitement into this world)

34
00:01:38,556 --> 00:01:40,911
I shouldn't do this here...

35
00:01:42,219 --> 00:01:44,410
(I am the true dancing king)

36
00:01:44,410 --> 00:01:46,954
I shouldn't do this...

37
00:01:46,954 --> 00:01:49,995
I shouldn't be doing this!

38
00:01:49,995 --> 00:01:52,658
I really shouldn't!

39
00:01:52,658 --> 00:01:54,034
(A pro at silly dances)

40
00:01:54,034 --> 00:01:56,255
I can't do this!

41
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:00,226
(Very exciting indeed)

42
00:02:00,557 --> 00:02:03,514
Let's give them both a big hand.

43
00:02:04,014 --> 00:02:06,566
Hyunmoo, I'm sure you were reminded of the end of

44
00:02:06,566 --> 00:02:08,519
last year as you watched the "Gashina" dance.

45
00:02:08,519 --> 00:02:10,480
I was a bit surprised.
She did a great job since she did modern dance.

46
00:02:14,104 --> 00:02:16,741
But I felt like Hyejin did a better job.

47
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:23,027
Yewon's angry now!

48
00:02:23,027 --> 00:02:24,984
(Boiling up)

49
00:02:25,452 --> 00:02:27,359
(This guy is the worst...)

50
00:02:27,359 --> 00:02:29,404
(Geez!)

51
00:02:29,404 --> 00:02:31,598
I really tried my hardest there.

52
00:02:31,598 --> 00:02:33,589
Yewon, your eyes were like...
"Sheesh."

53
00:02:35,625 --> 00:02:37,536
(He can't help it since he's in love...)

54
00:02:37,536 --> 00:02:40,417
Yewon, I hear there's a part you want to play.

55
00:02:40,417 --> 00:02:42,905
I've never been in a period piece.

56
00:02:42,905 --> 00:02:46,802
They call me the PH.

57
00:02:46,802 --> 00:02:48,632
The parted host.

58
00:02:48,632 --> 00:02:51,360
I tend to part my hair down the middle often.

59
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,197
So a lot of my listeners tell me

60
00:02:53,197 --> 00:02:55,034
to do a historical drama.

61
00:02:55,034 --> 00:02:57,728
I should play her father.

62
00:02:59,066 --> 00:03:02,706
Please love me like a daughter.

63
00:03:02,706 --> 00:03:05,262
What's going on with you two?

64
00:03:05,262 --> 00:03:06,528
It's not like that.
