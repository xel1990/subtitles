63
00:01:25,970 --> 00:01:28,310  
 
sometimes when you're talking to your

64
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:28,320  
sometimes when you're talking to your
 

65
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,710

71
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:37,880  
you're gonna say oh that's so true
because it's more informal when you're

72
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:37,890  
because it's more informal when you're
 

73
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:41,660  
because it's more informal when you're
speaking with your friends sometimes if

74
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:41,670  
speaking with your friends sometimes if

77
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:46,490  
you agree with one side but you don't
agree with another side so like let's

78
00:01:46,490 --> 00:01:46,500  
agree with another side so like let's
 

79
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:48,289  
agree with another side so like let's
say two people are arguing about

00:01:48,289 --> 00:01:48,299  
say two people are arguing about
 

81
00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:50,660  
say two people are arguing about
something or maybe they're having a

00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:50,670  
something or maybe they're having a
 

83
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:53,810  
something or maybe they're having a
discussion you can take one side by

84
00:01:53,810 --> 00:01:53,820  
discussion you can take one side by
 

85
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:56,749  
discussion you can take one side by
saying I have to side with dad on this

86
00:01:56,749 --> 00:01:56,759  
saying I have to side with dad on this
 

87
00:01:56,759 --> 00:02:00,020  
saying I have to side with dad on this
one so for example if your mom and dad

106
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:23,250  
like for example your friends may say oh
 

107
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:26,400  
like for example your friends may say oh

108
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:26,410  
my god I've had such a long day today
 

109
00:02:26,410 --> 00:02:29,640

my god I agree with you
 

113
00:02:31,709 --> 00:02:34,350  
my god I agree with you
another thing that you can say is you're

114
00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:34,360  
another thing that you can say is you're
 

115
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:38,970  
another thing that you can say is you're
absolutely right sometimes people say

116
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:38,980  
absolutely right sometimes people say
 

117
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:42,059  
absolutely right sometimes people say
negative statements so like I'm not

118
00:02:42,059 --> 00:02:42,069  
negative statements so like I'm not
 

119
00:02:42,069 --> 00:02:44,819  
negative statements so like I'm not
going to that party tonight you can say

120
00:02:44,819 --> 00:02:44,829  
going to that party tonight you can say
 

121
00:02:44,829 --> 00:02:46,289  
going to that party tonight you can say
me neither

122
00:02:46,289 --> 00:02:46,299  
me neither
 

123
00:02:46,299 --> 00:02:48,240  
me neither
so you're agreeing with the person and

124
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:48,250  
so you're agreeing with the person and
 

125
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:50,339  
so you're agreeing with the person and
you're probably not going to go either

126
00:02:50,339 --> 00:02:50,349  
you're probably not going to go either
 

127
00:02:50,349 --> 00:02:56,160  
you're probably not going to go either
so that's one thing to say that's

128
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:56,170  
so that's one thing to say that's
 

129
00:02:56,170 --> 00:02:59,729  
so that's one thing to say that's
exactly how I feel so sometimes someone

130
00:02:59,729 --> 00:02:59,739  
exactly how I feel so sometimes someone
 

131
00:02:59,739 --> 00:03:02,369  
exactly how I feel so sometimes someone
may be talking about you know anything

132
00:03:02,369 --> 00:03:02,379  
may be talking about you know anything
 

133
00:03:02,379 --> 00:03:05,420  
may be talking about you know anything
and they may say something like you know

134
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:05,430  
and they may say something like you know
 

135
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:09,990  
and they may say something like you know
I think that they shouldn't be doing

136
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:10,000  
I think that they shouldn't be doing
 

137
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,220  
I think that they shouldn't be doing
this to other people you can say I

138
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:13,230  
this to other people you can say I
 

139
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:18,020  
this to other people you can say I
that's exactly how I feel

140
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:18,030  
 
 

141
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:20,340  
 
again when you're siding with another

142
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:20,350  
again when you're siding with another
 

143
00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:22,259  
again when you're siding with another
person so let's say there's more than

144
00:03:22,259 --> 00:03:22,269  
person so let's say there's more than
 

145
00:03:22,269 --> 00:03:24,539  
person so let's say there's more than
one person having a discussion I'm

146
00:03:24,539 --> 00:03:24,549  
one person having a discussion I'm
 

147
00:03:24,549 --> 00:03:27,470  
one person having a discussion I'm
afraid I agree with James this time and

148
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:27,480  
afraid I agree with James this time and
 

149
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:31,680  
afraid I agree with James this time and
then if you agree a hundred percent you

150
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:31,690  
then if you agree a hundred percent you
 

151
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:35,339  
then if you agree a hundred percent you
can also say no doubt about it so these

152
00:03:35,339 --> 00:03:35,349  
can also say no doubt about it so these
 

153
00:03:35,349 --> 00:03:37,699  
can also say no doubt about it so these
are all some ways that you can agree

154
00:03:37,699 --> 00:03:37,709  
are all some ways that you can agree
 

155
00:03:37,709 --> 00:03:41,580  
are all some ways that you can agree
with people some of them are informal

156
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:41,590  
with people some of them are informal
 

157
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:43,500

209
00:05:05,259 --> 00:05:08,510  
can be true but not always so this is
