instead of trying to just teach someone

195
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:31,910

like this I created the fluency bridge

202
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:40,660
like this I created the fluency bridge
learning system and so this is taking

203
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:40,670
learning system and so this is taking

204
00:03:40,670 --> 00:03:43,030
learning system and so this is taking
the phrases that you're learning slowing

205
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:43,040
the phrases that you're learning slowing

206
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,710
the phrases that you're learning slowing
them down teaching you the different
