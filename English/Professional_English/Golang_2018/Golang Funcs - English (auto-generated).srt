1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:01,939  
 
so we're talking about funks we're

2
00:00:01,939 --> 00:00:01,949  
so we're talking about funks we're
 

3
00:00:01,949 --> 00:00:03,470  
so we're talking about funks we're
learning the language fundamentals and

4
00:00:03,470 --> 00:00:03,480  
learning the language fundamentals and
 

5
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:05,360  
learning the language fundamentals and
then we're gonna get into web dev so

6
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:05,370  
then we're gonna get into web dev so
 

7
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:06,889  
then we're gonna get into web dev so
we'll spend a couple of classes on

8
00:00:06,889 --> 00:00:06,899  
we'll spend a couple of classes on
 

9
00:00:06,899 --> 00:00:09,919  
we'll spend a couple of classes on
language fundamentals and now we're

10
00:00:09,919 --> 00:00:09,929  
language fundamentals and now we're
 

11
00:00:09,929 --> 00:00:14,390  
language fundamentals and now we're
going to create another funk and and so

12
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:14,400  
going to create another funk and and so
 

13
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:19,400  
going to create another funk and and so
to create another funk funk foo and then

14
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:19,410  
to create another funk funk foo and then
 

15
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:22,189  
to create another funk funk foo and then
we just have it print something hey

16
00:00:22,189 --> 00:00:22,199  
we just have it print something hey
 

17
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:29,359  
we just have it print something hey
what's up and then I could call foo and

18
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:29,369  
what's up and then I could call foo and
 

19
00:00:29,369 --> 00:00:32,120  
what's up and then I could call foo and
these parentheses used to kind of be

20
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:32,130  
these parentheses used to kind of be
 

21
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:34,520  
these parentheses used to kind of be
weird to me like why why do I need the

22
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:34,530  
weird to me like why why do I need the
 

23
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:38,709  
weird to me like why why do I need the
parentheses to execute you know and

24
00:00:38,709 --> 00:00:38,719  
parentheses to execute you know and
 

25
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:41,569  
parentheses to execute you know and
function you always have to when you

26
00:00:41,569 --> 00:00:41,579  
function you always have to when you
 

27
00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:44,240  
function you always have to when you
call a function so the identifier is foo

28
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:44,250  
call a function so the identifier is foo
 

29
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:47,959  
call a function so the identifier is foo
and when you call the function you need

30
00:00:47,959 --> 00:00:47,969  
and when you call the function you need
 

31
00:00:47,969 --> 00:00:50,569  
and when you call the function you need
to have those parentheses to tell the

32
00:00:50,569 --> 00:00:50,579  
to have those parentheses to tell the
 

33
00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:53,569  
to have those parentheses to tell the
program if there are any arguments that

34
00:00:53,569 --> 00:00:53,579  
program if there are any arguments that
 

35
00:00:53,579 --> 00:00:57,650  
program if there are any arguments that
you're passing in and even if there are

36
00:00:57,650 --> 00:00:57,660  
you're passing in and even if there are
 

37
00:00:57,660 --> 00:00:59,810  
you're passing in and even if there are
no arguments you have to tell it that so

38
00:00:59,810 --> 00:00:59,820  
no arguments you have to tell it that so
 

39
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:01,849  
no arguments you have to tell it that so
those friends are kind of that's how a

40
00:01:01,849 --> 00:01:01,859  
those friends are kind of that's how a
 

41
00:01:01,859 --> 00:01:07,039  
those friends are kind of that's how a
function executes now a function is just

42
00:01:07,039 --> 00:01:07,049  
function executes now a function is just
 

43
00:01:07,049 --> 00:01:10,789  
function executes now a function is just
another type and go-go is all about type

44
00:01:10,789 --> 00:01:10,799  
another type and go-go is all about type
 

45
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:14,830  
another type and go-go is all about type
if we look at the language specification

46
00:01:14,830 --> 00:01:14,840  
if we look at the language specification
 

47
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:20,060  
if we look at the language specification
we look at the different types my index

48
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:20,070  
we look at the different types my index
 

49
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:22,270  
we look at the different types my index
will pop up here in a second the

50
00:01:22,270 --> 00:01:22,280  
will pop up here in a second the
 

51
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:24,350  
will pop up here in a second the
different types here in the language

52
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:24,360  
different types here in the language
 

53
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:30,649  
different types here in the language
specification a function is one of the

54
00:01:30,649 --> 00:01:30,659  
specification a function is one of the
 

55
00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:34,730  
specification a function is one of the
types and int is one of the types it's

56
00:01:34,730 --> 00:01:34,740  
types and int is one of the types it's
 

57
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:38,980  
types and int is one of the types it's
under numeric string is one of the types

58
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:38,990  
under numeric string is one of the types
 

59
00:01:38,990 --> 00:01:44,030  
under numeric string is one of the types
so just just like any other type if we

60
00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:44,040  
so just just like any other type if we
 

61
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:47,210  
so just just like any other type if we
wanted to we could do some cool things

62
00:01:47,210 --> 00:01:47,220  
wanted to we could do some cool things
 

63
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:49,870  
wanted to we could do some cool things
with it like assign it to another

64
00:01:49,870 --> 00:01:49,880  
with it like assign it to another
 

65
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:53,620  
with it like assign it to another

can't do that

98
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:54,870  
can't do that
 

99
00:02:54,870 --> 00:03:00,720  
can't do that
so fubar and this one will have will

100
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:00,730  
so fubar and this one will have will
 

101
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:04,320  
so fubar and this one will have will
pass something in to it we're gonna pass

102
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:04,330  
pass something in to it we're gonna pass
 

103
00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:06,210  
pass something in to it we're gonna pass
in a string and then we'll use that

104
00:03:06,210 --> 00:03:06,220  
in a string and then we'll use that
 

105
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:14,040  
in a string and then we'll use that
string and we'll return the string

106
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:14,050  
string and we'll return the string
 

107
00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:18,000  
string and we'll return the string
sprint line and it's going to return a

108
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:18,010  
sprint line and it's going to return a
 

109
00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:24,479  
sprint line and it's going to return a
string sweet and now we're going to call

110
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:24,489  
string sweet and now we're going to call
 

111
00:03:24,489 --> 00:03:27,030  
string sweet and now we're going to call
that one and I'm going to put all this

112
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:27,040  
that one and I'm going to put all this
 

113
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:30,990  
that one and I'm going to put all this
about to exit onto one line right within

114
00:03:30,990 --> 00:03:31,000  
about to exit onto one line right within
 

115
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,789  
about to exit onto one line right within
the raw string literal just clean up a

116
00:03:32,789 --> 00:03:32,799  
the raw string literal just clean up a
 

117
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:37,259  
the raw string literal just clean up a
little bit now we'll call bar and to

118
00:03:37,259 --> 00:03:37,269  
little bit now we'll call bar and to
 

119
00:03:37,269 --> 00:03:42,560  
little bit now we'll call bar and to
call bar we need to pass in a string and

120
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:42,570  
call bar we need to pass in a string and
 

121
00:03:42,570 --> 00:03:47,910  
call bar we need to pass in a string and
then it's returning a string so I'm

122
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:47,920  
then it's returning a string so I'm
 

123
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:51,930  
then it's returning a string so I'm
going to return I don't know sign it too

124
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:51,940  
going to return I don't know sign it too
 

125
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:55,740  
going to return I don't know sign it too
and that's a number usually I'll sign it

126
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:55,750  
and that's a number usually I'll sign it
 

127
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:56,970  
and that's a number usually I'll sign it
too I don't know

128
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:56,980  
too I don't know
 

129
00:03:56,980 --> 00:04:02,009  
too I don't know
a and I'm gonna just clean this up here

130
00:04:02,009 --> 00:04:02,019  
a and I'm gonna just clean this up here
 

131
00:04:02,019 --> 00:04:05,280  
a and I'm gonna just clean this up here
because now we could see you know sprint

132
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:05,290

133
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:07,080

line and something being returned so I'm

134
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:07,090  
line and something being returned so I'm
 

135
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:12,120  
line and something being returned so I'm
gonna bring that right here and now I

136
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:12,130  
gonna bring that right here and now I
 

137
00:04:12,130 --> 00:04:16,229  
gonna bring that right here and now I
need to use a because if I have a

138
00:04:16,229 --> 00:04:16,239  
need to use a because if I have a
 

139
00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:18,270  
need to use a because if I have a

I use it
 

143
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:21,240  
I use it
watch that red underline under a
