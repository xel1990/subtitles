1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:01,819  
 
so we'll look at the solution to this

2
00:00:01,819 --> 00:00:01,829  
so we'll look at the solution to this
 

3
00:00:01,829 --> 00:00:07,220  
so we'll look at the solution to this
hands-on exercise and I guess I'll do it

4
00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:07,230  
hands-on exercise and I guess I'll do it
 

5
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:11,690  
hands-on exercise and I guess I'll do it
here so that code goes up create a new

6
00:00:11,690 --> 00:00:11,700  
here so that code goes up create a new
 

7
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:16,640  
here so that code goes up create a new
folder and we'll call this 0 on 0 and on

8
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:16,650  
folder and we'll call this 0 on 0 and on
 

9
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:19,760  
folder and we'll call this 0 on 0 and on
and then inside there we'll create a new

10
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:19,770  
and then inside there we'll create a new
 

11
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:25,370  
and then inside there we'll create a new
folder I'll call it 1 and inside there

12
00:00:25,370 --> 00:00:25,380  
folder I'll call it 1 and inside there
 

13
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:31,450  
folder I'll call it 1 and inside there
will create a new go file call it main

14
00:00:31,450 --> 00:00:31,460  
will create a new go file call it main
 

15
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:35,950  
will create a new go file call it main
and its package main and func main and

16
00:00:35,950 --> 00:00:35,960  
and its package main and func main and
 

17
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:38,180  
and its package main and func main and
we want to create a program that stores

18
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:38,190  
we want to create a program that stores
 

19
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:40,190  
we want to create a program that stores
two in values and two different

20
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:40,200  
two in values and two different
 

21
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:46,760  
two in values and two different
variables so X colon equal 40 Y colon

22
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:46,770  
variables so X colon equal 40 Y colon
 

23
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:55,850  
variables so X colon equal 40 Y colon
equal to z : equal X plus y and format

24
00:00:55,850 --> 00:00:55,860  
equal to z : equal X plus y and format
 

25
00:00:55,860 --> 00:01:02,420  
equal to z : equal X plus y and format
print line see I think that's what we're

26
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:02,430  
print line see I think that's what we're
 

27
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:05,240  
print line see I think that's what we're
looking for to multiplies the values and

28
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:05,250  
looking for to multiplies the values and
 

29
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:06,800  
looking for to multiplies the values and
those variables together and stores

30
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:06,810  
those variables together and stores
 

31
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:08,210  
those variables together and stores
result in third round and prints out the

32
00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:08,220  
result in third round and prints out the
 

33
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:10,490  
result in third round and prints out the
value of the third variable so we don't

34
00:01:10,490 --> 00:01:10,500  
value of the third variable so we don't
 

35
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:15,859  
value of the third variable so we don't
multiplication and then to run that CD

36
00:01:15,859 --> 00:01:15,869  
multiplication and then to run that CD
 

37
00:01:15,869 --> 00:01:20,149  
multiplication and then to run that CD
