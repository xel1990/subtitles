added to get ignore file maybe you

70
00:01:45,889 --> 00:01:45,899  
added to get ignore file maybe you
 

71
00:01:45,899 --> 00:01:49,789  
added to get ignore file maybe you
didn't but this dot get ignore and you

72
00:01:49,789 --> 00:01:49,799  
didn't but this dot get ignore and you
 

73
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:51,889  
didn't but this dot get ignore and you
could just tell it to ignore like you

74
00:01:51,889 --> 00:01:51,899  
could just tell it to ignore like you
 

75
00:01:51,899 --> 00:01:55,460  
could just tell it to ignore like you
could look up your own BS code get

76
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:55,470  
could look up your own BS code get
 

77
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:59,780  
could look up your own BS code get
ignore golang right and you can look up

78
00:01:59,780 --> 00:01:59,790  
ignore golang right and you can look up
 

79
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:04,520  
ignore golang right and you can look up
a going get ignore file and so here's

80
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:04,530  
a going get ignore file and so here's
 

81
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:07,010  
a going get ignore file and so here's
one and we'll go look at it you can just

82
00:02:07,010 --> 00:02:07,020  
one and we'll go look at it you can just
 

83
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:09,770  
one and we'll go look at it you can just
copy that to you bash history vs code

84
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:09,780  
copy that to you bash history vs code
 

85
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:13,470

group the world and then you could
 

215
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:42,570

by the way here we have addy is a

218
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:46,060  
by the way here we have addy is a
 

219
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:50,520  
by the way here we have addy is a
directory and I don't have any files

220
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:50,530  
directory and I don't have any files
 

221
00:05:50,530 --> 00:05:52,230  
directory and I don't have any files
let's see if I have any files here I

222
00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:52,240  
let's see if I have any files here I
 

223
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:55,230  
let's see if I have any files here I
don't have any files there but if I do

224
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:55,240  
don't have any files there but if I do
 

225
00:05:55,240 --> 00:06:00,000  
don't have any files there but if I do
like touch on a no cowboy and then do

226
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:00,010  
like touch on a no cowboy and then do
 

227
00:06:00,010 --> 00:06:04,200  
like touch on a no cowboy and then do
this again now I have instead of addy

228
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:04,210  
this again now I have instead of addy
 

229
00:06:04,210 --> 00:06:06,870  
this again now I have instead of addy
for directory I just have - and that's a

230
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:06,880  
for directory I just have - and that's a
 

231
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:09,689  
for directory I just have - and that's a
file so I'm going to remove and if I if

232
00:06:09,689 --> 00:06:09,699  
file so I'm going to remove and if I if
 

233
00:06:09,699 --> 00:06:11,670  
file so I'm going to remove and if I if
it is a directory I do recursively with

234
00:06:11,670 --> 00:06:11,680  
it is a directory I do recursively with
 

235
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:16,500  
it is a directory I do recursively with
force I'm gonna remove cowboy and now

236
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:16,510  
force I'm gonna remove cowboy and now
 

237
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:22,680  
force I'm gonna remove cowboy and now
that should be gone

238
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:22,690  
 
 

239
00:06:22,690 --> 00:06:27,879  
 
it's gone so the way change mod works is

240
00:06:27,879 --> 00:06:27,889  
it's gone so the way change mod works is
 

241
00:06:27,889 --> 00:06:30,670  
it's gone so the way change mod works is
you're gonna pass in a number like

242
00:06:30,670 --> 00:06:30,680  
you're gonna pass in a number like
 

243
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:36,879  
you're gonna pass in a number like
change mod 777 temp text or change mod

244
00:06:36,879 --> 00:06:36,889  
change mod 777 temp text or change mod

00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:45,440  
what are those numbers so Reed has a
 

249
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:48,240  
what are those numbers so Reed has a
value of four right has a value of two

250
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:48,250  
value of four right has a value of two
 

251
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:50,650  
value of four right has a value of two
executes has a value of one

252
00:06:50,650 --> 00:06:50,660  
executes has a value of one

you could get whatever combination of

254
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:53,990  
you could get whatever combination of
 

255
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:56,890  
you could get whatever combination of
some of those up as you want so if I

256
00:06:56,890 --> 00:06:56,900  
some of those up as you want so if I
 

257
00:06:56,900 --> 00:07:02,080  
some of those up as you want so if I
wanted for for for the owner if I wanted

258
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:02,090  
wanted for for for the owner if I wanted
 

259
00:07:02,090 --> 00:07:17,159  
wanted for for for the owner if I wanted
permissions of only read for the owner

260
00:07:17,159 --> 00:07:17,169  
 
 

261
00:07:17,169 --> 00:07:19,900  
 
so if I wanted permissions of only read

262
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:19,910  
so if I wanted permissions of only read
 

263
00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:24,100  
so if I wanted permissions of only read
for the owner I would give for and if I

264
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:24,110  
for the owner I would give for and if I
 

265
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:27,370  
for the owner I would give for and if I
wanted for the world group to read and

266
00:07:27,370 --> 00:07:27,380  
wanted for the world group to read and
 

267
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:30,790  
wanted for the world group to read and
write I would give six because read is

268
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:30,800  
write I would give six because read is
 

269
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:36,339  
write I would give six because read is
for write is to 4 plus 2 is 6 and if for

270
00:07:36,339 --> 00:07:36,349  
for write is to 4 plus 2 is 6 and if for
 

271
00:07:36,349 --> 00:07:38,440  
for write is to 4 plus 2 is 6 and if for
the world I wanted to give execute I

272
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:38,450  
the world I wanted to give execute I
 

273
00:07:38,450 --> 00:07:42,900  
the world I wanted to give execute I
would give one so I would do change mod

274
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:42,910  
would give one so I would do change mod
 

275
00:07:42,910 --> 00:07:46,210  
would give one so I would do change mod
461 temp text and then it would change

276
00:07:46,210 --> 00:07:46,220  
461 temp text and then it would change
 

277
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:51,310  
461 temp text and then it would change
this RW x RW x RW x to match that

278
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:51,320  
this RW x RW x RW x to match that
 

279
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:53,140  
this RW x RW x RW x to match that
appropriately it would be for the owner

280
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:53,150  
appropriately it would be for the owner
 

281
00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:59,379  
appropriately it would be for the owner
it would be it would be read - - for the

00:08:06,129 --> 00:08:06,139  
read/write - and for no that was the
 

287
00:08:06,139 --> 00:08:08,409

group and for the world it would be

288
00:08:08,409 --> 00:08:08,419  
group and for the world it would be
 

289
00:08:08,419 --> 00:08:13,810  
group and for the world it would be
execute so be read write execute and

290
00:08:13,810 --> 00:08:13,820  
execute so be read write execute and
 

291
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:15,450  
execute so be read write execute and
that's what would show up right here

292
00:08:15,450 --> 00:08:15,460  
that's what would show up right here
 

293
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:19,570  
that's what would show up right here
from four six one you get it how many

294
00:08:19,570 --> 00:08:19,580  
from four six one you get it how many
 

295
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:22,450  
from four six one you get it how many
people get it so what would be the

296
00:08:22,450 --> 00:08:22,460  
people get it so what would be the
 

297
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:26,980  
people get it so what would be the
change mod if I wanted to give owner if

00:12:12,819 --> 00:12:17,939  
Aspen LS LA and I can see it's got
readwrite for owner read for group read

408
00:12:17,939 --> 00:12:17,949  
readwrite for owner read for group read
 

409
00:12:17,949 --> 00:12:21,780  
readwrite for owner read for group read
for world and if I do change mod and I

410
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:21,790  
for world and if I do change mod and I
 

411
00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:23,660  
for world and if I do change mod and I
want read write execute for the owner

group and the world is just going to be
 

461
00:14:20,210 --> 00:14:22,420

useful is at some point we might upload
 

495
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:32,380  
useful is at some point we might upload
files to a server and need to set the
