for this next hands-on exercise create a

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:03,510  
for this next hands-on exercise create a
 

3
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:06,530  
for this next hands-on exercise create a
func which takes two arguments a value

4
00:00:06,530 --> 00:00:06,540  
func which takes two arguments a value
 

5
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:08,240  
func which takes two arguments a value
of type string and a value of type int

6
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:08,250  
of type string and a value of type int
 

7
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:11,629  
of type string and a value of type int
the func should print out the two values

8
00:00:11,629 --> 00:00:11,639  
the func should print out the two values
 

9
00:00:11,639 --> 00:00:14,299  
the func should print out the two values
from func main call the funky main and

10
00:00:14,299 --> 00:00:14,309  
from func main call the funky main and
 

11
00:00:14,309 --> 00:00:17,029  
from func main call the funky main and
pass in your name and your age call the

12
00:00:17,029 --> 00:00:17,039  
pass in your name and your age call the
 

13
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:18,950  
pass in your name and your age call the
func again and pass in the name and age

14
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:18,960  
func again and pass in the name and age
 

15
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:22,310  
func again and pass in the name and age
of one of your friends submit the URL to

16
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:22,320  
of one of your friends submit the URL to
 

17
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:23,779  
of one of your friends submit the URL to
your program so that's the next hands-on

18
00:00:23,779 --> 00:00:23,789  
your program so that's the next hands-on
 

19
00:00:23,789 --> 00:00:25,609  
your program so that's the next hands-on
one it's very similar similar to the

20
00:00:25,609 --> 00:00:25,619  
one it's very similar similar to the
 

21
00:00:25,619 --> 00:00:27,920  
one it's very similar similar to the
last one but this time we're defining a

22
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:27,930  
last one but this time we're defining a
 

23
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:29,540  
last one but this time we're defining a
function with parameters then when we

24
00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:29,550  
function with parameters then when we
 

25
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:31,669  
function with parameters then when we
call it we're passing in arguments and

26
00:00:31,669 --> 00:00:31,679  
call it we're passing in arguments and
 

27
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:33,639  
call it we're passing in arguments and
we're going to call that function twice

28
00:00:33,639 --> 00:00:33,649  
we're going to call that function twice
 

29
00:00:33,649 --> 00:00:35,360  
we're going to call that function twice
let's do it

30
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:35,370  
let's do it
 

31
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:38,150  
let's do it
let's do this let's do this hands-on

32
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:38,160  
let's do this let's do this hands-on
 

33
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:40,670  
let's do this let's do this hands-on
