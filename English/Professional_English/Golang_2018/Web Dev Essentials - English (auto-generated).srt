00:00:02,669 --> 00:00:06,230  
so we're just continuing to kind of go
through these assignments and so

4
00:00:06,230 --> 00:00:06,240  
through these assignments and so
 

5
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:07,579  
through these assignments and so
describe the client-server architecture

6
00:00:07,579 --> 00:00:07,589  
describe the client-server architecture
 

7
00:00:07,589 --> 00:00:09,680  
describe the client-server architecture
what analogy was using class what do

8
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:09,690  
what analogy was using class what do
 

9
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:13,600  
what analogy was using class what do
clients do and what do servers do so

10
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:13,610  
clients do and what do servers do so
 

11
00:00:13,610 --> 00:00:15,560  
clients do and what do servers do so
client-server architecture is a way to

12
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:15,570  
client-server architecture is a way to
 

13
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:18,650  
client-server architecture is a way to
arrange the roles of computers on a

14
00:00:18,650 --> 00:00:18,660  
arrange the roles of computers on a
 

15
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:21,410  
arrange the roles of computers on a
network just like in a restaurant this

16
00:00:21,410 --> 00:00:21,420  
network just like in a restaurant this
 

17
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:23,870  
network just like in a restaurant this
is the analogy in a restaurant we have

18
00:00:23,870 --> 00:00:23,880  
is the analogy in a restaurant we have
 

19
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:27,560  
is the analogy in a restaurant we have
clients and servers servers serve food

20
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:27,570  
clients and servers servers serve food
 

21
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:29,330  
clients and servers servers serve food
clients ask the service for food the

22
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:29,340  
clients ask the service for food the
 

23
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:31,519  
clients ask the service for food the
server's go and get it bring it back the

24
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:31,529  
server's go and get it bring it back the
 

25
00:00:31,529 --> 00:00:34,340  
server's go and get it bring it back the
same analogies kind of what the roles of

26
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:34,350  
same analogies kind of what the roles of
 

27
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:36,350  
same analogies kind of what the roles of
computers on the network do their

28
00:00:36,350 --> 00:00:36,360  
computers on the network do their
 

29
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:38,180  
computers on the network do their
clients who ask for information and

30
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:38,190  
clients who ask for information and
 

31
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:40,160  
clients who ask for information and
servers fulfill them servers are just

32
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:40,170  
servers fulfill them servers are just
 

33
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:42,139  
servers fulfill them servers are just
regular computers running certain

34
00:00:42,139 --> 00:00:42,149  
regular computers running certain
 

35
00:00:42,149 --> 00:00:44,209  
regular computers running certain
software they're ready to accept

36
00:00:44,209 --> 00:00:44,219  
software they're ready to accept
 

37
00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:47,299  
software they're ready to accept
requests and fulfill those requests like

38
00:00:47,299 --> 00:00:47,309  
requests and fulfill those requests like
 

39
00:00:47,309 --> 00:00:49,100  
requests and fulfill those requests like
on the web we have web servers regular

40
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:49,110  
on the web we have web servers regular
 

41
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:51,049  
on the web we have web servers regular
computers running certain software and

42
00:00:51,049 --> 00:00:51,059  
computers running certain software and
 

43
00:00:51,059 --> 00:00:53,779  
computers running certain software and
goes the software we could use to

44
00:00:53,779 --> 00:00:53,789  
goes the software we could use to
 

45
00:00:53,789 --> 00:00:55,700  
goes the software we could use to
fulfill those requests to create a

46
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:55,710  
fulfill those requests to create a
 

47
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:57,979  
fulfill those requests to create a
server so that's a client-server

48
00:00:57,979 --> 00:00:57,989  
server so that's a client-server
 

49
00:00:57,989 --> 00:01:01,369  
server so that's a client-server
architecture and Linux user permissions

50
00:01:01,369 --> 00:01:01,379  
architecture and Linux user permissions
 

51
00:01:01,379 --> 00:01:03,470  
architecture and Linux user permissions
what does this mean who has access what

52
00:01:03,470 --> 00:01:03,480  
what does this mean who has access what
 

53
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:04,820  
what does this mean who has access what
kind of access to they have is this a

54
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:04,830  
kind of access to they have is this a
 

55
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:07,130  
kind of access to they have is this a
directory or a file - directory we know

56
00:01:07,130 --> 00:01:07,140  
directory or a file - directory we know
 

57
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:10,490  
directory or a file - directory we know
that by the D and we have owner group

58
00:01:10,490 --> 00:01:10,500  
that by the D and we have owner group
 

59
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:12,140  
that by the D and we have owner group
world the owner has read write execute

60
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:12,150  
world the owner has read write execute
 

61
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:17,780  
world the owner has read write execute
the group has read execute and the world

62
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:17,790  
the group has read execute and the world
 

63
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:20,749  
the group has read execute and the world
has read and write I think I have too

64
00:01:20,749 --> 00:01:20,759  
has read and write I think I have too
 

65
00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:22,850  
has read and write I think I have too
many things in there we need to edit

66
00:01:22,850 --> 00:01:22,860  
many things in there we need to edit
 

67
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:31,370  
many things in there we need to edit
this so it's owner group world

68
00:01:31,370 --> 00:01:31,380  
this so it's owner group world
 

69
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:35,300  
this so it's owner group world
so the first three our owner the first

70
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:35,310  
so the first three our owner the first
 

71
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:42,190  
so the first three our owner the first
three our owner the next three are group

72
00:01:42,190 --> 00:01:42,200  
 
 

73
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:49,020  
 
read and execute for the group

74
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:49,030  
 
 

75
00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:52,350  
 
and the last three are the world read

76
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:52,360  
and the last three are the world read
 

77
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:57,539  
and the last three are the world read
and write for the world and when we see

78
00:01:57,539 --> 00:01:57,549  
and write for the world and when we see
 

79
00:01:57,549 --> 00:02:00,870  
and write for the world and when we see
that like in our course outline you have

80
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:00,880  
that like in our course outline you have
 

81
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:06,030  
that like in our course outline you have
that nice diagram let's see that here we

82
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:06,040  
that nice diagram let's see that here we
 

83
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:11,790  
that nice diagram let's see that here we
could see the owner we could see the

84
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:11,800  
could see the owner we could see the
 

85
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:23,130  
could see the owner we could see the
group and in the world is everyone so

86
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:23,140  
group and in the world is everyone so
 

87
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:25,110  
group and in the world is everyone so
just understanding the terminal the

88
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:25,120  
just understanding the terminal the
 

89
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:29,150  
just understanding the terminal the
shell bash okay

90
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:29,160  
shell bash okay
 

91
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:41,820  
shell bash okay
so save that and then we have a changing

92
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:41,830  
so save that and then we have a changing
 

93
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:44,160  
so save that and then we have a changing
user commit permissions and Linux what

94
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:44,170  
user commit permissions and Linux what
 

95
00:02:44,170 --> 00:02:46,080  
user commit permissions and Linux what
command will use at the terminal to get

96
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:46,090  
command will use at the terminal to get
 

97
00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:47,400  
command will use at the terminal to get
the following users the following

98
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:47,410  
the following users the following
 

99
00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:49,220  
the following users the following
permissions owner read write execute

100
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:49,230  
permissions owner read write execute
 

101
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:56,490  
permissions owner read write execute
what would the number be 41 remember for

102
00:02:56,490 --> 00:02:56,500  
what would the number be 41 remember for
 

103
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:59,250  
what would the number be 41 remember for
for read to four right one for execute

104
00:02:59,250 --> 00:02:59,260  
for read to four right one for execute
 

105
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:01,199  
for read to four right one for execute
so if you want the owner to have read

106
00:03:01,199 --> 00:03:01,209  
so if you want the owner to have read
 

107
00:03:01,209 --> 00:03:11,940  
so if you want the owner to have read
write execute what number seven

108
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:11,950  
 
 

109
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:16,060  
 
so the owner read/write/execute

110
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:16,070  
so the owner read/write/execute
 

111
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:18,250  
so the owner read/write/execute
I'm sorry to belabor this if you're

112
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:18,260  
I'm sorry to belabor this if you're
 

113
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:20,320  
I'm sorry to belabor this if you're
watching this video online but we have a

114
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:20,330  
watching this video online but we have a
 

115
00:03:20,330 --> 00:03:22,600  
watching this video online but we have a
deaf student in class and so we're just

116
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:22,610  
deaf student in class and so we're just
 

117
00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:24,400  
deaf student in class and so we're just
making sure we go slow she's having to

118
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:24,410  
making sure we go slow she's having to
 

119
00:03:24,410 --> 00:03:26,620  
making sure we go slow she's having to
watch the person signing at the same

120
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:26,630  
watch the person signing at the same
 

121
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:30,550  
watch the person signing at the same
time and then looked at the screen but

122
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:30,560  
time and then looked at the screen but
 

123
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:33,840  
time and then looked at the screen but
here we have the owner

124
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:33,850  
here we have the owner
 

125
00:03:33,850 --> 00:03:37,710  
here we have the owner
read/write/execute

126
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:37,720  
 
 

127
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:48,970  
 
read for right to execute 1 4 plus 2

128
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:48,980  
read for right to execute 1 4 plus 2
 

129
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:55,270  
read for right to execute 1 4 plus 2
plus 1 7 and the group is read and

130
00:03:55,270 --> 00:03:55,280  
plus 1 7 and the group is read and
 

131
00:03:55,280 --> 00:04:02,680  
plus 1 7 and the group is read and
execute so that's going to be 4 + 1 5

132
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:02,690  
execute so that's going to be 4 + 1 5
 

133
00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:06,220  
execute so that's going to be 4 + 1 5
and then the public is read and that's 4

134
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:06,230  
and then the public is read and that's 4
 

135
00:04:06,230 --> 00:04:10,320  
and then the public is read and that's 4
and I'm just gonna confirm that

136
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:10,330  
and I'm just gonna confirm that
 

137
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:13,930  
and I'm just gonna confirm that
read/write/execute 4 2 1 read write

138
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:13,940  
read/write/execute 4 2 1 read write
 

139
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:16,390  
read/write/execute 4 2 1 read write
execute and here we had read write

140
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:16,400  
execute and here we had read write
 

141
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:17,860  
execute and here we had read write
execute just making sure they're in the

142
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:17,870  
execute just making sure they're in the
 

143
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:20,680  
execute just making sure they're in the
right order cuz I'm no genius I know

144
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:20,690  
right order cuz I'm no genius I know
 

145
00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:23,290  
right order cuz I'm no genius I know
what I know and I know what I don't know

146
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:23,300  
what I know and I know what I don't know
 

147
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:29,440  
what I know and I know what I don't know
and it's important to understand both of

148
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:29,450  
and it's important to understand both of
 

149
00:04:29,450 --> 00:04:34,980  
and it's important to understand both of
those so I'm still learning to you

150
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:34,990  
 
 

151
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:37,300  
 
alright and then we get into variables

152
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:37,310  
alright and then we get into variables
 

153
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:39,100  
alright and then we get into variables
we'll do that in the next video this is

154
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:39,110  
we'll do that in the next video this is
 

155
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:42,790  
we'll do that in the next video this is
finishing up terminal commands
