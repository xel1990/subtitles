00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:08,900  
either at the go leg playground or we
have all now set up our IDE or

00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:08,910  
have all now set up our IDE or
 

7
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:11,419  
have all now set up our IDE or
environment either place create a

8
00:00:11,419 --> 00:00:11,429  
environment either place create a
 

9
00:00:11,429 --> 00:00:13,730  
environment either place create a
program that stores to it values and two

10
00:00:13,730 --> 00:00:13,740  
program that stores to it values and two
 

11
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:16,279  
program that stores to it values and two
different variables multiplies the

12
00:00:16,279 --> 00:00:16,289  
different variables multiplies the
 

13
00:00:16,289 --> 00:00:18,230  
different variables multiplies the
values in those variables together and

14
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:18,240  
values in those variables together and
 

15
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:19,939  
values in those variables together and
stores the results in a third variable

16
00:00:19,939 --> 00:00:19,949  
stores the results in a third variable
 

17
00:00:19,949 --> 00:00:22,279  
stores the results in a third variable
then prints out the value of the third

18
00:00:22,279 --> 00:00:22,289  
then prints out the value of the third
 

19
00:00:22,289 --> 00:00:25,040  
then prints out the value of the third
variable submit the share URL for your

20
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:25,050  
variable submit the share URL for your
 

21
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:29,990  
variable submit the share URL for your
program or you could upload the you

22
00:00:29,990 --> 00:00:30,000  
program or you could upload the you
 

23
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,569  
program or you could upload the you
could submit the URL to your github code

24
00:00:32,569 --> 00:00:32,579  
could submit the URL to your github code
 

25
00:00:32,579 --> 00:00:36,080  
could submit the URL to your github code
is also absolutely fine okay so let's

26
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:36,090  
is also absolutely fine okay so let's
 

27
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:37,700  
is also absolutely fine okay so let's
all do this hands-on exercise and get

28
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:37,710  
all do this hands-on exercise and get
 

29
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:40,129  
all do this hands-on exercise and get
some code
