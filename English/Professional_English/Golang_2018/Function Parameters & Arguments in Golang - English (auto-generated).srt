00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:07,780  
you know sometimes they talk about
statements and expression like I don't

160
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:07,790  
statements and expression like I don't
 

161
00:06:07,790 --> 00:06:10,090  
statements and expression like I don't
know what you're talking about right

162
00:06:10,090 --> 00:06:10,100  
know what you're talking about right
 

163
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:11,740  
know what you're talking about right
parameters and argument what are you

164
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:11,750  
parameters and argument what are you
 

165
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:13,420  
parameters and argument what are you
talking about all these different words

166
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:13,430  
talking about all these different words
 

167
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:16,450  
talking about all these different words
so I'm teaching you the language with

168
00:06:16,450 --> 00:06:16,460  
so I'm teaching you the language with
 

169
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:19,630  
so I'm teaching you the language with
which the language which we use to talk

170
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:19,640  
which the language which we use to talk
 

171
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:22,270  
which the language which we use to talk
about the language or the language we

172
00:06:22,270 --> 00:06:22,280  
about the language or the language we
 

173
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:25,600  
about the language or the language we
use to talk about programming how many

174
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:25,610  
use to talk about programming how many
 

175
00:06:25,610 --> 00:06:30,280  
use to talk about programming how many
people that's helpful for you right so

176
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:30,290  
people that's helpful for you right so
 

177
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:32,080  
people that's helpful for you right so
you could point to something when you

178
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:32,090  
you could point to something when you
 

179
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:34,150  
you could point to something when you
get into a code shop and start working

180
00:06:34,150 --> 00:06:34,160  
get into a code shop and start working
 

181
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,740  
get into a code shop and start working
you can say what's going on with that

182
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:35,750  
you can say what's going on with that
 

183
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:40,240  
you can say what's going on with that
expression right there or look at the

184
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:40,250  
expression right there or look at the
 

185
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:45,220  
expression right there or look at the
statement on line 25 or lying 26 look at

186
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:45,230  
statement on line 25 or lying 26 look at
 

187
00:06:45,230 --> 00:06:47,950  
statement on line 25 or lying 26 look at
the statement on line 26 and you know

188
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:47,960  
the statement on line 26 and you know
 

189
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:49,270  
the statement on line 26 and you know
you're not gonna say you'll sound like

190
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:49,280  
you're not gonna say you'll sound like
 

191
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:50,409  
you're not gonna say you'll sound like
you know what you're talking about which

192
00:06:50,409 --> 00:06:50,419  
you know what you're talking about which
 

193
00:06:50,419 --> 00:06:53,080  
you know what you're talking about which
you will know it's talking about you'll

194
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:53,090  
you will know it's talking about you'll
 

195
00:06:53,090 --> 00:06:54,580  
you will know it's talking about you'll
know the difference between statement

196
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:54,590  
know the difference between statement
 

197
00:06:54,590 --> 00:06:57,250  
know the difference between statement
and expression between very between

198
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:57,260  
and expression between very between
 

199
00:06:57,260 --> 00:06:59,440  
and expression between very between
parameter and argument you define a

200
00:06:59,440 --> 00:06:59,450  
parameter and argument you define a
 

201
00:06:59,450 --> 00:07:02,590  
parameter and argument you define a
function with the parameter you call a

202
00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:02,600  
function with the parameter you call a
 

203
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:12,480  
function with the parameter you call a
function and pass in arguments beautiful

204
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:12,490  
 
 

205
00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:16,360  
 
so we've got multiple parameters we have

206
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:16,370  
so we've got multiple parameters we have
 

207
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:20,159  
so we've got multiple parameters we have
multiple returns that's kind of cool

208
00:07:20,159 --> 00:07:20,169  
multiple returns that's kind of cool
 

209
00:07:20,169 --> 00:07:24,130  
multiple returns that's kind of cool
and I think that's a good place to end

210
00:07:24,130 --> 00:07:24,140  
and I think that's a good place to end
 

211
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:25,960  
and I think that's a good place to end
on this video we've kind of got some

212
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:25,970  
on this video we've kind of got some
 

213
00:07:25,970 --> 00:07:28,390  
on this video we've kind of got some
functions here going I think I'll give

214
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:28,400  
functions here going I think I'll give
 

215
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,460  
functions here going I think I'll give
you a hands-on exercise in the next

216
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:30,470  
you a hands-on exercise in the next
 

217
00:07:30,470 --> 00:07:34,300  
you a hands-on exercise in the next
video so you can code
