00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:02,090  
 
here's the solution to this hands-on

2
00:00:02,090 --> 00:00:02,100  
here's the solution to this hands-on
 

3
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:04,999  
here's the solution to this hands-on
exercise I'm going to create a new

4
00:00:04,999 --> 00:00:05,009  
exercise I'm going to create a new
 

5
00:00:05,009 --> 00:00:15,160  
exercise I'm going to create a new
folder 0 3 and then create a new file

6
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:15,170  
folder 0 3 and then create a new file
 

7
00:00:15,170 --> 00:00:20,660  
folder 0 3 and then create a new file
thing and this is package main and func

8
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:20,670  
thing and this is package main and func
 

9
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:23,480  
thing and this is package main and func
main and then I have to create a new

10
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:23,490  
main and then I have to create a new
 

11
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:30,439  
main and then I have to create a new
function so funk foo and and if I had

12
00:00:30,439 --> 00:00:30,449  
function so funk foo and and if I had
 

13
00:00:30,449 --> 00:00:31,759  
function so funk foo and and if I had
returned to be there but that's the

14
00:00:31,759 --> 00:00:31,769  
returned to be there but that's the
 

15
00:00:31,769 --> 00:00:37,520  
returned to be there but that's the
basics for function and I want to take

16
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:37,530  
basics for function and I want to take
 

17
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:43,760  
basics for function and I want to take
in a string any variable and I also want

18
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:43,770  
in a string any variable and I also want
 

19
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:48,170  
in a string any variable and I also want
to take in an int and so this these are

20
00:00:48,170 --> 00:00:48,180  
to take in an int and so this these are
 

21
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:52,100  
to take in an int and so this these are
the parameters when I define my function

22
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:52,110  
the parameters when I define my function
 

23
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:57,439  
the parameters when I define my function
I could pass values in so I define my

24
00:00:57,439 --> 00:00:57,449  
I could pass values in so I define my
 

25
00:00:57,449 --> 00:01:00,170  
I could pass values in so I define my
function with parameters I could pass

26
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:00,180  
function with parameters I could pass
 

27
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:08,149  
function with parameters I could pass
values into that so when I pass a value

28
00:01:08,149 --> 00:01:08,159  
values into that so when I pass a value
 

29
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:11,020  
values into that so when I pass a value
of type string into this function and

30
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:11,030  
of type string into this function and
 

31
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:14,149  
of type string into this function and
type int into this function I'm gonna

32
00:01:14,149 --> 00:01:14,159  
type int into this function I'm gonna
 

33
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:16,700  
type int into this function I'm gonna
pass in a string in an int I have to

34
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:16,710  
pass in a string in an int I have to
 

35
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:19,760  
pass in a string in an int I have to
pass them in as this in this order so I

36
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:19,770  
pass them in as this in this order so I
 

37
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:23,330  
pass them in as this in this order so I
will call this function foo and I have

38
00:01:23,330 --> 00:01:23,340  
will call this function foo and I have
 

39
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:28,460  
will call this function foo and I have
to pass in a string and I also have to

40
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:28,470  
to pass in a string and I also have to
 

41
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:33,920  
to pass in a string and I also have to
pass in an int so I defined my function

42
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:33,930  
pass in an int so I defined my function
 

43
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:36,980  
pass in an int so I defined my function
with parameters it's gonna take a value

44
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:36,990  
with parameters it's gonna take a value
 

45
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:38,810  
with parameters it's gonna take a value
of type string and a value of type int

46
00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:38,820  
of type string and a value of type int
 

47
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:44,440  
of type string and a value of type int
and I call my function with arguments

48
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:44,450  
and I call my function with arguments
 

49
00:01:44,450 --> 00:01:47,899  
and I call my function with arguments
it's going to take an argument of types

50
00:01:47,899 --> 00:01:47,909  
it's going to take an argument of types
 

51
00:01:47,909 --> 00:01:50,420  
it's going to take an argument of types
of type string and an argument of type

52
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:50,430  
of type string and an argument of type
 

53
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:53,389  
of type string and an argument of type
int in that order when I pass in Tod

54
00:01:53,389 --> 00:01:53,399  
int in that order when I pass in Tod
 

55
00:01:53,399 --> 00:01:57,230  
int in that order when I pass in Tod
here to this string it gets assigned to

56
00:01:57,230 --> 00:01:57,240  
here to this string it gets assigned to
 

57
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:02,030  
here to this string it gets assigned to
a variable X when I pass in 42 here to

58
00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:02,040  
a variable X when I pass in 42 here to
 

59
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:04,429  
a variable X when I pass in 42 here to
this int it gets assigned to a variable

60
00:02:04,429 --> 00:02:04,439  
this int it gets assigned to a variable
 

61
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:10,550  
this int it gets assigned to a variable
Y the scope of x and y is this function

62
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:10,560  
Y the scope of x and y is this function
 

63
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:14,300  
Y the scope of x and y is this function
I could use and reference the variable

64
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:14,310  
I could use and reference the variable
 

65
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:17,780  
I could use and reference the variable
X&amp;Y inside that function not anywhere

66
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:17,790  
X&amp;Y inside that function not anywhere
 

67
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:21,170  
X&amp;Y inside that function not anywhere
else so I could come here and I could do

68
00:02:21,170 --> 00:02:21,180  
else so I could come here and I could do
 

69
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:26,660  
else so I could come here and I could do
format print line X comma Y and that

70
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:26,670  
format print line X comma Y and that
 

71
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:39,949  
format print line X comma Y and that
should run now the nice thing about

72
00:02:39,949 --> 00:02:39,959  
should run now the nice thing about
 

73
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:42,110  
should run now the nice thing about
functions this allows us to modularize

74
00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:42,120  
functions this allows us to modularize
 

75
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:47,570  
functions this allows us to modularize
our code we take a chunk of code and we

76
00:02:47,570 --> 00:02:47,580  
our code we take a chunk of code and we
 

77
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:49,970  
our code we take a chunk of code and we
put it into a function and we call that

78
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:49,980  
put it into a function and we call that
 

79
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:52,690  
put it into a function and we call that
function something that it does a

80
00:02:52,690 --> 00:02:52,700  
function something that it does a
 

81
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:56,660  
function something that it does a
calculate grade maybe so if we are you

82
00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:56,670  
calculate grade maybe so if we are you
 

83
00:02:56,670 --> 00:02:59,240  
calculate grade maybe so if we are you
know working with students we could have

84
00:02:59,240 --> 00:02:59,250  
know working with students we could have
 

85
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:02,830  
know working with students we could have
a function calculate grade which will

86
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:02,840  
a function calculate grade which will
 

87
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:05,150  
a function calculate grade which will
get all the scores for a student

88
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:05,160  
get all the scores for a student
 

89
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:07,190  
get all the scores for a student
calculate the grade grade and return a

90
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:07,200  
calculate the grade grade and return a
 

91
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:10,160  
calculate the grade grade and return a
result we only have to write that

92
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:10,170  
result we only have to write that
 

93
00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:12,470  
result we only have to write that
function once and we could call it over

94
00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:12,480  
function once and we could call it over
 

95
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:15,380  
function once and we could call it over
and over so it allows us to not repeat

96
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:15,390  
and over so it allows us to not repeat
 

97
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:17,509  
and over so it allows us to not repeat
ourselves in our code do not repeat

98
00:03:17,509 --> 00:03:17,519  
ourselves in our code do not repeat
 

99
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:20,690  
ourselves in our code do not repeat
yourself DRI is the principal and it

100
00:03:20,690 --> 00:03:20,700  
yourself DRI is the principal and it
 

101
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:33,780  
yourself DRI is the principal and it
allows us to call a function many times

102
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:33,790  
 
 

103
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:46,110  
 
I don't know who 17 I will do my friend

104
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:46,120  
I don't know who 17 I will do my friend
 

105
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:52,110  
I don't know who 17 I will do my friend
Cole and now when I run this right each

106
00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:52,120  
Cole and now when I run this right each
 

107
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:55,170  
Cole and now when I run this right each
time it called that function it passed

108
00:03:55,170 --> 00:03:55,180  
time it called that function it passed
 

109
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:59,509  
time it called that function it passed
in arguments of the requested type and

110
00:03:59,509 --> 00:03:59,519  
in arguments of the requested type and
 

111
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:02,460  
in arguments of the requested type and
then you sign those two variables and

112
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:02,470  
then you sign those two variables and
 

113
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:06,360  
then you sign those two variables and
then it ran the code here so the program

114
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:06,370  
then it ran the code here so the program
 

115
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:10,349  
then it ran the code here so the program
entered here it ran foo I ran foo I ran

116
00:04:10,349 --> 00:04:10,359  
entered here it ran foo I ran foo I ran
 

117
00:04:10,359 --> 00:04:16,529  
entered here it ran foo I ran foo I ran
foo around food program accident so

118
00:04:16,529 --> 00:04:16,539  
foo around food program accident so
 

119
00:04:16,539 --> 00:04:18,810  
foo around food program accident so
that's this solution to this problem

120
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:18,820  
that's this solution to this problem
 

121
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:23,760  
that's this solution to this problem
create a func and created a func it

00:04:25,529 --> 00:04:25,539  
takes two arguments a value of type
 

125
00:04:25,539 --> 00:04:27,600  
takes two arguments a value of type
string and a value of type int takes two

126
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:27,610  
string and a value of type int takes two
 

127
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:29,460  
string and a value of type int takes two
arguments about you type string about

128
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:29,470  
arguments about you type string about
 

129
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:32,909  
arguments about you type string about
you've type int the func should print

130
00:04:32,909 --> 00:04:32,919  
you've type int the func should print
 

131
00:04:32,919 --> 00:04:37,250  
you've type int the func should print
out two values prints out the two values

132
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:37,260  
out two values prints out the two values
 

133
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:40,020  
out two values prints out the two values
from func main call the funky made and

134
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:40,030  
from func main call the funky made and
 

135
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:42,510  
from func main call the funky made and
passing your name and age called the

136
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:42,520  
passing your name and age called the
 

137
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:44,939  
passing your name and age called the
func I made passed in my name and a

138
00:04:44,939 --> 00:04:44,949  
func I made passed in my name and a
 

139
00:04:44,949 --> 00:04:49,740  
func I made passed in my name and a
number and then call the func in and

140
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:49,750  
number and then call the func in and
 

141
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:51,390  
number and then call the func in and
pass in the name and age of one of your

142
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:51,400  
pass in the name and age of one of your
 

143
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:54,180  
pass in the name and age of one of your
friends so I called it again and passed

144
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:54,190  
friends so I called it again and passed
 

145
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:58,250  
friends so I called it again and passed
in the name of age of other people so

146
00:04:58,250 --> 00:04:58,260  
 
 

147
00:04:58,260 --> 00:05:03,500  
 
some important concepts covered there

148
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:03,510  
 
 

149
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:07,529  
 
this is a function alright so we created

150
00:05:07,529 --> 00:05:07,539  
this is a function alright so we created
 

151
00:05:07,539 --> 00:05:09,570  
this is a function alright so we created
a function functions allow us to

152
00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:09,580  
a function functions allow us to
 

153
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:10,320  
a function functions allow us to
modularize

154
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:10,330  
modularize
 

155
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:17,490  
modularize
our code and dry do not don't repeat

156
00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:17,500

190
00:06:44,339 --> 00:06:44,349  
well through association and what that
 

191
00:06:44,349 --> 00:06:51,270  
well through association and what that
means is if you go to like let's say

192
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:51,280  
means is if you go to like let's say
 

193
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:54,689  
means is if you go to like let's say

00:06:57,210 --> 00:06:57,220  
practice and then afterwards you go get
 

197
00:06:57,220 --> 00:07:00,029

he says hey let's go to karate and you

200
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:04,090  
he says hey let's go to karate and you

00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:08,590  
Mexican food afterwards karate and
 

205
00:07:08,590 --> 00:07:10,680  
Mexican food afterwards karate and
Mexican food got associated in your mind

206
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:10,690  
Mexican food got associated in your mind

with me I can't remember the students

210
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:17,260  
with me I can't remember the students
 

211
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:21,870  
with me I can't remember the students
name until I I told a story about how

212
00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:21,880  
name until I I told a story about how
 

213
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:25,710  
name until I I told a story about how
you say can in Spanish lotta like a can

214
00:07:25,710 --> 00:07:25,720  
you say can in Spanish lotta like a can
 

215
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:28,890  
you say can in Spanish lotta like a can
and then as soon as like I did that my

216
00:07:28,890 --> 00:07:28,900  
and then as soon as like I did that my
 

217
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:31,170  
and then as soon as like I did that my
mind went back to when that story

218
00:07:31,170 --> 00:07:31,180  
mind went back to when that story
 

219
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:33,060  
mind went back to when that story
occurred a week before and when I

220
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:33,070  
occurred a week before and when I
 

221
00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:35,399  
occurred a week before and when I
learned his name and his name Jose came

222
00:07:35,399 --> 00:07:35,409  
learned his name and his name Jose came
 

223
00:07:35,409 --> 00:07:38,700  
learned his name and his name Jose came
to me so that story lotta and his name

224
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:38,710  
to me so that story lotta and his name
 

225
00:07:38,710 --> 00:07:41,279  
to me so that story lotta and his name
were all associated in my mind so as

226
00:07:41,279 --> 00:07:41,289  
were all associated in my mind so as
 

227
00:07:41,289 --> 00:07:43,290  
were all associated in my mind so as
soon as I said the lot to store and like

228
00:07:43,290 --> 00:07:43,300  
soon as I said the lot to store and like
 

229
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:45,810  
soon as I said the lot to store and like
oh yeah his name's Jose came to my head

230
00:07:45,810 --> 00:07:45,820  
oh yeah his name's Jose came to my head
 

231
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:47,850  
oh yeah his name's Jose came to my head
so the mind learns through association

232
00:07:47,850 --> 00:07:47,860  
so the mind learns through association
 

233
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:49,920  
so the mind learns through association
I'm telling you that because some of you

234
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:49,930  
I'm telling you that because some of you

I'm telling you that because some of you
I could see are struggling a little bit

236
00:07:51,210 --> 00:07:51,220  
I could see are struggling a little bit
 

237
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:54,510  
I could see are struggling a little bit
with this idea that you know we kind of

238
00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:54,520  
with this idea that you know we kind of
 

239
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:56,730  
with this idea that you know we kind of
modularize our code and put it into

240
00:07:56,730 --> 00:07:56,740  
modularize our code and put it into
 

241
00:07:56,740 --> 00:07:58,560  
modularize our code and put it into
functions and then call those functions

242
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:58,570  
functions and then call those functions
 

243
00:07:58,570 --> 00:08:00,600  
functions and then call those functions
and so a good thing is to think about

244
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:00,610  
and so a good thing is to think about
 

245
00:08:00,610 --> 00:08:01,410  
and so a good thing is to think about
some

246
00:08:01,410 --> 00:08:01,420  
some
 

247
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:04,230  
some
that we can compare that to some sort of

248
00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:04,240  
that we can compare that to some sort of
 

249
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:08,250  
that we can compare that to some sort of
an analogy and an analogy might be like

250
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:08,260  
an analogy and an analogy might be like
 

251
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:13,440  
an analogy and an analogy might be like
storage containers in your fridge right

storage containers in your fridge right
 

253
00:08:13,450 --> 00:08:15,360  
storage containers in your fridge right
like so you get done with dinner and you

254
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:15,370  
like so you get done with dinner and you
 

255
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:18,150  
like so you get done with dinner and you
had steak and you get salad and you had

256
00:08:18,150 --> 00:08:18,160  
had steak and you get salad and you had
 

257
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,760  
had steak and you get salad and you had
rice well if you threw all that into one

258
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:20,770  
rice well if you threw all that into one
 

259
00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:22,440  
rice well if you threw all that into one
container it's just kind of gonna be a

260
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:22,450  
container it's just kind of gonna be a
 

261
00:08:22,450 --> 00:08:24,600  
container it's just kind of gonna be a
big mess you know

262
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:24,610  
big mess you know
 

263
00:08:24,610 --> 00:08:26,010  
big mess you know
and you throw that in the fridge you

264
00:08:26,010 --> 00:08:26,020  
and you throw that in the fridge you
 

265
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:28,320  
and you throw that in the fridge you
pull it out now the rice the salad and

266
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:28,330  
pull it out now the rice the salad and
 

267
00:08:28,330 --> 00:08:31,160  
pull it out now the rice the salad and
the steak all the flavors are messed up

268
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:31,170  
the steak all the flavors are messed up
 

269
00:08:31,170 --> 00:08:33,570  
the steak all the flavors are messed up
but if you put them each into their own

270
00:08:33,570 --> 00:08:33,580  
but if you put them each into their own
 

271
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:36,270  
but if you put them each into their own
container and then store them in the

272
00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:36,280  
container and then store them in the
 

273
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:38,190  
container and then store them in the
fridge when you're ready to use them

274
00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:38,200  
fridge when you're ready to use them
 

275
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:40,200  
fridge when you're ready to use them
again you pull them back up out and open

276
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:40,210  
again you pull them back up out and open
 

277
00:08:40,210 --> 00:08:42,290  
again you pull them back up out and open
up each container and it's like oh cool

278
00:08:42,290 --> 00:08:42,300  
up each container and it's like oh cool
 

279
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:44,970  
up each container and it's like oh cool
you know there's my salad container

280
00:08:44,970 --> 00:08:44,980  
you know there's my salad container
 

281
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:48,660  
you know there's my salad container
there's my my container for steak

282
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:48,670  
there's my my container for steak
 

283
00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:51,990  
there's my my container for steak
there's my container for rice and you

284
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:52,000  
there's my container for rice and you
 

285
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,580  
there's my container for rice and you
get the container with the stuff in it

286
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:53,590  
get the container with the stuff in it
 

287
00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:55,470  
get the container with the stuff in it
that you want in the same way these are

288
00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:55,480  
that you want in the same way these are
 

289
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:58,440  
that you want in the same way these are
containers and we put into them things

290
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:58,450  
containers and we put into them things
 

291
00:08:58,450 --> 00:09:00,930  
containers and we put into them things
that are related like here's the

292
00:09:00,930 --> 00:09:00,940  
that are related like here's the
 

293
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:02,490  
that are related like here's the
function which prints out the name and

294
00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:02,500  
function which prints out the name and
 

295
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:06,030  
function which prints out the name and
the age cool we only want to write that

296
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:06,040  
the age cool we only want to write that
 

297
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:07,590  
the age cool we only want to write that
function once and then we could use it

298
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:07,600  
function once and then we could use it
 

299
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:10,200  
function once and then we could use it
over and over and over or here's the

300
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:10,210  
over and over and over or here's the
 

301
00:09:10,210 --> 00:09:11,760  
over and over and over or here's the
function that calculates a student's

302
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:11,770  
function that calculates a student's
 

303
00:09:11,770 --> 00:09:13,380  
function that calculates a student's
great cool we only want to write that

304
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:13,390  
great cool we only want to write that
 

305
00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:14,820  
great cool we only want to write that
once and then for each student we'll

306
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:14,830  
once and then for each student we'll
 

307
00:09:14,830 --> 00:09:17,790  
once and then for each student we'll
call it so that's called calling a

308
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:17,800  
call it so that's called calling a
 

309
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:20,270  
call it so that's called calling a
function when we call a func

310
00:09:20,270 --> 00:09:20,280
