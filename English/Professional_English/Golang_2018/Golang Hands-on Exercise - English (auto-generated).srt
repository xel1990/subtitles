00:00:02,929 --> 00:00:02,939  
cool so another hands-on exercise how
 

3
00:00:02,939 --> 00:00:04,309  
cool so another hands-on exercise how
many people are enjoying these hands-on

4
00:00:04,309 --> 00:00:04,319  
many people are enjoying these hands-on
 

5
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:07,400  
many people are enjoying these hands-on
exercises good kind of like just do some

6
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:07,410  
exercises good kind of like just do some
 

7
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:09,919  
exercises good kind of like just do some
coding right create a func that

8
00:00:09,919 --> 00:00:09,929  
coding right create a func that
 

9
00:00:09,929 --> 00:00:12,169  
coding right create a func that
multiplies two arguments which are both

10
00:00:12,169 --> 00:00:12,179  
multiplies two arguments which are both
 

11
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:14,839  
multiplies two arguments which are both
of type int and returns the returns the

12
00:00:14,839 --> 00:00:14,849  
of type int and returns the returns the
 

13
00:00:14,849 --> 00:00:19,609  
of type int and returns the returns the
result is an int and I'm gonna add

14
00:00:19,609 --> 00:00:19,619  
result is an int and I'm gonna add
 

15
00:00:19,619 --> 00:00:23,800  
result is an int and I'm gonna add
something and what I'm going to add is

16
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:23,810  
something and what I'm going to add is
 

17
00:00:23,810 --> 00:00:32,080  
something and what I'm going to add is
then print out the returned return value

18
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:32,090  
then print out the returned return value
 

19
00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:36,380  
then print out the returned return value
okay let's do that hands-on exercise and

20
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:36,390  
okay let's do that hands-on exercise and
 

21
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:39,979  
okay let's do that hands-on exercise and
so now we have a function that's going

22
00:00:39,979 --> 00:00:39,989  
so now we have a function that's going
 

23
00:00:39,989 --> 00:00:42,560  
so now we have a function that's going
to take in two arguments of type int and

24
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:42,570  
to take in two arguments of type int and
 

25
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:46,639  
to take in two arguments of type int and
it's going to return in it so let's

26
00:00:46,639 --> 00:00:46,649  
it's going to return in it so let's
 

27
00:00:46,649 --> 00:00:49,070  
it's going to return in it so let's
build that
